W. 1Mr. Walton, ^ ' ) I fear I have been unable to get down to this question of the ownership of Tamb, but it might perhaps wait until my return? The article in P.G.13 about Tamb and Abu Musa is still the most convenient summary of the position. Mr. Lascelles’ memorandum, of which a copy is at P.Z.2149/35* started as a brief summary of the more important points in the P.Gr. memorandum, but has now acquired an independent existence of its own. I cannot help feeling that the Foreign Office are taking an unduly legalistic view of this question, and it seems to me impossible to treat these Arab tribes, largely half-savage, as though they had clear notions of the distinctions between private and international law and steered their course accordingly. But we might perhaps send C2. copies of the Foreign Office letters of 25th March rz f ys ~ and 1st May, and of my reply of oth April, to Colonel Fowle, and ask if the Bushire Residency could help by collecting any material additional to that embodied in/- 2 - in P.G.13 about the earlier relations of the Jowasimi Arabs on the Persian Coast with Tamb and with the Jowasimis on the Arab side. fa 2r- r-Jj-r o FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l 071 1st May, 1935. E 2336/4/91) My dear Laithwaite, Will you kindly refer to your letter of the 8th April (No. P.Z. 2149/35) about the ownership of Tamb, in which you asked to be informed of any further views which Beckett might have formed after reading the notes by Dickson and Loch enclosed in your letter No. P.Z. 2012/35 of the 23rd March. 2. Beckett states that he has not changed his views as a result of a perusal of these notes, but he elaborated one or two of the points arising out of your letter and I am therefore writing to give you the substance of his minute. 3. He points out tnat the information given by Dickson and Loch relates primarily to the ownership of private property, rather than to territorial sovereignty. The Arab tribes no doubt draw little distinction between the J.G.Laithwaite, Esq., G.I.E.the two in their own minds, hut assuming for the purpose of the present discussion that the Sheikhs hold their territory as representatives of their families or their tribes, then this does not amount to much more from the point of view of territorial sovereignty than saying that The King possesses sovereignty over the United Kingdom as the representative of his people. It does not alter the fact that if The King were to alienate some of his territory to a foreign power the alienation would be effective in international law, even if it involved a gross violation by The King of his duties toward his people. 4. Beckett then refers to point 3 in paragraph 2 of your letter, and emphasises again the importance of the question of whether it can be shown that the Sheikh at Lingah, during the years 1880-1887, ruled the islands of Tamb, Sirri and Abu Musa, in some capacity different from that in which he ruled a portion of the Persian mainland. He is rather doubtful of the value of your argumentargument that, even if the Sheikh of Lingah became a Persian vassal and clearly thereafter ruled the mainland as a Persian vassal, he could not bring under Persian sovereignty the islands which, unlike the mainland, had been continuously under the sovereignty of the Sheikhs on the other side of the G-ulf from time immemorial. He is not sure that there is much substance in this argument as a means of distinguishing between the islands and the mainland. The position in 1880 was that the Sheikhs at Lingah had resided continuously for the last 100 years on the mainland, and had ruled there as representatives of their family and independently of Persia. Presumably they alone, considered merely as representatives of their family, had no authority to cede the Sheikh’s rights to the Persian Government, even on the mainland . It appears to be difficult to distinguish between the mainland and the islands in this respect, until 1887, and the difference really lies in the fact that in 1887 the Persians obtained effective rule over the mainland and the island of Sirri, but never did so in respect of Tamb and Abu Musa. During the period 1880-1887 they may or may not have1 ^ have acquired a title to sovereignty over Tamb and Abu Musa through the Sheikh at Lingah, their vassal. The Sheikhs on the other side of the Gulf might perhaps in those years have disputed that title on the ground that the Sheikh at Lingah had no authority to transfer them to the Persians - but they might have said the same about the mainland. The Persian title during those years being in all probability somewhat uncertain, it would be so much the easier to persuade an arbitral tribunal that they had lost it by prescription since 1887.P.Z. 5091/35.

He told me that soon after the flagstaff was removed from Tunb, the Sheikh of Sharjah summoned him and sent him to Has al Khaimah to ask that Sheikh why he had removed the Tunb flagstaff. The Sheikh of Pas al Khaimah replied that he had ordered its removal 'for a certain reason”, after which cryptic utterance he asked the headman if he had heard any news from Tunb. The headman said he had been informed by nakhodas of dhows that a British sloop had been stationed at Tunb ever since the flagstaff had been removed.

IV dear Baggallay, I write with reference to our conversation about Renders letter of 25th March, E 1171/4/91, to say that I will go carefully into the points raised in Beckett’s note, hut that I think it might he of assistance if he could let us know to what extent, if at all, the information contained in the enclosures to Fowie's letter No. C-34 of 11th March affects his provisional conclusions. I might perhaps, however, take this opportunity to mention one or two points v/hich occur to me on a rapid re-reading of Beckett's minute. I will endeavour to develop them at a later stage. 2. Firstly,I do not think there has been any question of effective exercise of authority by Persia (I will again check such records as we have) on either lamb or Abu Musa for a very long period, or on Sirri prior to 1887. Secondly, I think that the relations between the W M Jowasimis of Lingaii and Iamb have been very much closer . ■——.i ■ i... .. ,— ■ - --- 2 - Atiu Musa, and that the latter has, indeed, under an understanding detween the chiefs of the clan, been exclusively used by the shargah branch. Thirdly, that •prima facie there seems some difficulty in completely ignoring the long period prior to 1880 during which the Jowasimis were in control of these islands and requiring proof that during the period 1880-1887 the sheikh of Lingah ruled the islands under some title different from that under which he ruled the mainland. Is it not more reasonably arguable (placing the case on the basis most favourable to Persia) that during the period 1880- 1887 it might be claimed that a Pdrsian subject ruled the islands, but that the Sheikhs on their side could claim that so brief a period, more particularly when during it there was no overt exercise of Persian authority on the islands, could not operate as against their traditional ownership of the islands, both for a very long period before 1880 and for the whole period since 1887? Yours ever, GILBERT UITHWAITE.\Nt)£X.Ek FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. (E 1171/4/91) E5th March, 1935. f My dear Gilbert, After the Middle Mast Official Sub-Committee Meeting on the Bth March I still felt rather uneasy (as I hinted to you in my letter E 1670/4/91 of the 13th March) about the legal basis of the Jowasimi title to Tsiiib. I accordingly sent the whole of the papers to Beckett for his opinion, and I now enclose a copy of the minute which he has written and which will, I think, be of some interest to you. the lascelles-Baggallay memorandum in its latest form i.e. with some recent additions made in the light of the 'Note on the Ownership of Tamb' enclosed m Inuia Office letter P.Z.11S6/35 of the 19th February. You In order that you may see exactly on what material Beckett was working, I also enclose a copy of will remember that I sent you a copy of this memorcndum * W T.G. Laithwaite, Esq., C.I.Ein an earlier form in my letter E 5652/3E83/91 of the 13th October, 1934* I feel I ought to draw your&gt;particular attenti to the last sentence of paragraph 5 in Beckett’s minute (i.e* his conclusion that in the period 1880 to 1887 the Sheikh of Lingah administered all his territories, including the islands, as a Persian vassal), and to the opening passages of paragraph 7, shewing that what we need, to complete our case from the legal point of view, is further, and more positive, evidence that in the years immediately preceding 1887 the Sheikh of lingah ruled the islands under some title different from that under which he ruled the mainland. The year 1880 is of course a purely arbitrary date* We have no information as to the exact period at which the Persians asserted themselves on the coast of the Gulf to such an extent that it could be said that from thenceforward the Sheikh of lingah became a Persian subject or a Persian vassal.I shcmld be very grateful fo:p your t observations Beckett's minute. i Yours ever, /$[ ! ' n COPY. (S 1171/4/91) ^erglan Claim to Tamil an d Ahn Uusa Memo randum by Mr. Lascelles 33ie position as regards the Persian claim to the Islands of Tamb and Abu Musa is generally similar to that as regards the Persian claim to Bahrain. Our case, that is ) t;o s&amp;y » rest;s on the fact that Persia has not exercised see°however, effeo1;ive:C ^nion in these islands for at least 184 years oelowT* 1 * 5 ^ aS asainst 15:1 y ears in the case of Bahrain). It is doubtful, indeed, whether even before 1750 she exercised dominion at Tamb and Abu Musa, whereas it is certain that she exercised dominion over Bahrain for a period before 1783. £. The Persian case has never been put forward systematically, but it is understood to be based on the following two points:- (1) Tamb and Abu Musa were shown as Persian on a War Office map presented to the Shah in 1888; (E) the Jowasimi Arab sheikhs of iingah (a port on the Persian coast), who administered Tamb and Abu Musa for a long period before their final expulsion from Persia in 1887, were, for a part of that period, Persian subjects governing Lingah as Persian officials. The Persian Government are understood to contend that the Sheikhs administered these islands also in their capacity of Persian officials. 3. Point (1) is unfortunate, but its importance as an argument is largely counteracted by the fact that both before and after the date on which the map was presented the emphatically and officially repudiated by Persian claim was His Majesty's Government 4 ./4. As regards (£) our contention is that this is a complete misconstruction of the facts, which are as follows: 5. Since the early part of the 18th century, and possibly earlier still, an Arab family or small clan known as the Qawazim or Jowasimi x have ruled over a large part of what is now commonly called the Trucial Goast. The heads of the clan resided indifferently at both Sharjah and Ras-ul- Khaimah and were described indifferently as 'Sheikh of Sharjah' or 'Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah'. Before 18S0 Ras- ul-Khaimah was probably the main residence, but after that Sharjah became more important, Ras-ul-Ehaimah being generally governed by one of the Sheikh 1 s relatives. This arrangement continued until 1869, when Sheikh Humaid bin Abdullah, the Governor of Ras-ul-Khaimah, made himself independent of Sharjah, and continued so until his death in 1900. After his death Sharjah and Ras-ul-Khaimah were re-united under Sheikh Saqar bin Khalid, who appointed his son Khalid bin Saqar as governor of Ras-ul-Khaimah. This son died in 1908 and Sheikh Saqar bin Khalid then appointed his uncle Salim bin Sultan as governor. The uncle soon claimed to be independent, but was never recognised as independent by the Government of India. He died in 1919 and was succeeded as governor and soi-disant Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah by his son Sultan bin Salim, who was recognised as Ruler by the Government of India in 19S1, and is still ruling. Since Sharjah and Ras-ul-Khaimah have been ruled/ Their subjects and tributaries are also generally called Jowasimi but the name really applies to the ruling family onlyruled as mutually independent Sheikhdoms hy different branches of the Jowasimi family* 6. Soon after the death of Nadir Shah in 1747, some of the Jowasimi led their followers (who then and thereafter were noted pirates and raiders) to the aid of the Persian Governor of Bunder Abbas and Hormuz, who was pressed for tribute by various Persian pretenders and involved in hostilities with various neighbouring chieftains. In the course of this and subsequent visits the Jowasimi took possession of Lingah, opposite the island of Qishm, and other places on the Persian coast. They were driven away during the ascendency of Karim Khan Zand, who ruled over Persia from 1763 to 1779, but after his death they returned, and held Lingah and the surrounding district as an Arab principality until 1887. Towards the end of this period the Persian Government asserted themselves to some extent upon the coast of the Gulf and the Jowasimi Sheikhs of Lingah finally became in effect Persian vassals, whose succession to the Sheikhdom was habitually recognised by the Shah in the form of an appointment as Governor of Lingah, who paid to the Shah f s viceroy at Shiraz such tribute as the latter could extract from them, and who acknowledged themselves to oe Persian subjects. In 1887 the Persian Government deposed the last Sheikh and took over the government of Lingah themselves. 7. Throughout the period under review, that is to say from a date earlier than 1747 to the present day, the islands of Tamb and Abu Musa, like the neighbouring Arab coast, have been in the possession and effective occupation of the ruling Jowasimi Sheikhs, the latter have always held them, however, in accordance with Arab custom, on behalf of their clan as a whole,/whole, not as their purely personal property. For many y ears pnxor to 1887, the management, administration, and jurisdiction of the two islands was by common consent vested in the chief* Jowasimi Sheikh of the Persian coast, that is, the Sheikh of Lingah, a near relative of the Sheikhs at Sharjah and Ras-ul-Khaimah* This administration was carried out on behalf of tne family as a whole. After the extinction of the Lingah principality in 1887, the administration of Tamb was transferred from Lingah to Ras-ul-Khaimah, and may be said to have been looked upon locally as connected with the Ras-ul-Khaimah district of the Jowasimi Sheikhdom of Sharjah, while Abu Musa was attached direct to Sharjah. This administrative division was maintained when Sharjah and Ras-ul-Khaimah were temporarily re-united early in the present century and when they finally became entirely separate, with the result that Abu Musa belongs nay as always to the Sheikh of Sharjah and Tamb has belonged since 19£1 to the Sheikh of Ras- ul-Khaimah . 8. Although, therefore, the Sheikhs of Lingah who administered Tamb and Abu Musa were at one period Persian vassals and even Persian officials, this fact was in no way whatever responsible for their connexion with the two islands. The Jot asimi owned Tamb and Abu Musa long before any of their number established themselves on Persian soil; the dominant Sheikh of the clan (and the greater part of the clan) never ceased to reside on the Trucial Coast; the rights of the Lingah Sheikhs, which were in any case derived from their family connexion and not from their position in Persia, were at all times shared with, and subordinate to, the rights of the Sheikhs on the Trucial Coast; and when the Lingah Sheikhs were/were finally driven from Persia, any shadow of connexion between their rights and Persia went with them. For the rest, the Jowasimi have never acknowledged Persian sovereignty over the islands, and documentary evidence of their rights has been produced to the Residency Agent on the Trucial Coast. 9. A minor difference between Bahrain on the one hand and Tamb and Abu Musa on the other, is that while Bahrain lies close to the Arabian shore, Tamb and Abu Musa are well out in the Gulf; Tamb is a good deal closer to the Persian than to the Arabian coast, Abu Musa is slightly nearer the Arabian* 10* The Persian claim to these islands was first asserted in 1887, the year in which the Jowasimis of Lingah were finally driven out of Persia; and has been re-asserted on five occasions between then and now. On the first of these occasions, in 1904, both Tamb and Abu Musa were temporarily occupied by the Persians, who, however, were induced, without the use of force, to withdraw after about a month. Less serious attempts to assert Persian sovereignty were made by Persian customs officials on three otr^r occasions. In each case the Persian Government reserved their rights, but, as already stated, they have never set forth their case in a full and systematic fasnion. On September 29th, 1934, His Majesty’s Government delivered a solemn warning to the Persian Government that in the event of further Persian interference at Tamb the rights of the Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah would in the last resort !e defended by force* 11. It should perhaps be added that until 1887 the history/history of the neighbouring island of Sirri was identical with that of Tamb and Abu Musa. (Sirri r like lamb, is rather nearer to Persia than to Arabia). It was the Persian seizure of Sirri in that year, and the establishment of a Persian customs post, which gave rise to the whole dispute. On wider political grounds His Majesty f s Government acquiesced de facto in the Persian occupation, but they have never recognized it de jure. In the draft Anglo-Persian general treaty (now virtually abandoned) it was proposed to perpetuate the existing de facto position, Persia recognizing that Tamb and Abu Musa belonged to the Jowasimi Sheikhs of Oman while His Majesty's ‘Government (on behalf of the Sheikh of Sharjah) recognized Sirri as Persian. The possibility of leasing Tamb to Persia was also examined in connexion with these negotiations, but it is unlikely that the Sheikh of Has- ul-Khaimah would lease the island on any terms acceptable to the Persian Government. IB. The Government of India maintain a light-house on Tamb, which is otherwise of little importance, having only some fifty inhabitants. Permission for the erection of the light-house was obtained in 1912 from the Sheikh of Sharjah (see paragraph 5) and up till now no rent has been paid for it. The Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah has flown his flag there continuously since when he was advised to hoist it as a sign of his sovereignty. 13* A Memorandum dealing with the history of the two islands, which was communicated to Teymourtache in 1930, will be found in E 5934/5773/34 (1930) (Print: Persia Part XXIX No. 160) and a note on the population etc. of the islandThis case is, I think, quite different from that of Bahrain. The relevant facts, as I understand them, are as follows. 2. An Arab family known as the Jowasimi Sheikhs established themselves as rulers of a portion of the Trucial Coast in the early 18th century with their headquarters at Ras-al-Khaimah. I will assume that the islands of Tamb, Abu-Musa and Sirri were at this early date part of their dominions, though this is not quite clear. At about 1750 and up to about 1767 a member of this family established himself at Lingah and from there ruled a portion of the Persian mainland. He also ruled over the three islands of Tamb, Abu-Musa and Sirri. Further, he ruled as deputy for the principal Sheikh of the family at Ras-al-Khaimah and/or as representative of his whole family. I assume, since there is nothing to indicate the contrary, that his position as ruler of the three islands on the one hand and of a portion I of the Persian mainland on the other was at that time the same, i.e. he ruled as a member of the Jowasimi family, etc. 3. At about 1767 the Jcwasimi Sheikhs were driven away from lingah and the Persians established themselves there, and this state of affairs continued till about 1779* I have no information as to whether during this period the three islands were ruled by the Persians or by the Jowasimi Sheikhs from the other side of the Gulf. 4. At about 1780 a member of the Jowasimi family again established himself at Lingah and ruled a portion of the mainland and the three islands. Again I presume that both as regards/regards the mainland and as regards the three islands he ruled as representative of his family, etc* This state of affairs went on for about ICO years, i.e. till about 1880* 5* In or about 1880 the Jowasimi Sheikh at Lingah became a Persian subject and a Persian vassal and thence- forward it would appear that the Persians possessed sovereignty over Lingah and ruled it through this Jowasimi Sheikh as their vassal* It would hardly seem that after this date the Jorasimi Sheikh at Lingah can have continued to rule there as representative of the Jowasimi Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast, and there is no evidence before me that during this period there was any distinction to be drawn between his position with regard to the territories on the mainland which he ruled and with regard to the three islands; that is to say, there is nothing to show that, though he became a Persian vassal as regards the territories of the mainland, he ruled the three islands in a different capacity, i.e. still as a representa tive of the head of his family on the other side of the Gulf. I think this point is important, but I do not know whether it is possible to get any further information with regard to it* It is to be noted, moreover, that at this time, on the other side of the Gulf, Ras-al-Khaimah and Sharjah, formerly part of the same principality under the single head of the Jowasimi family, had become divided between two branches of the family ruling quite independently one from the other (it seems that the first period of separation between Sharjah and Ras-al- Khaimah was from 1869 to 1900), and this separation would not make it any easier to show that the SheiKh at Ling^h was continuing in this period to rule the islands as the represen tative of his now completely divided family across the Gulf.I think it is very likely that the conclusion to he drawn is that during this period the Sheikh at Lingah ruled all his territories (i.e. including the islands) as a Persian vassal. 6. The state of affairs discussed in the previous paragraph lasted till 1887, when the Persians drove out their vassal Jowasimi Sheikh from Lingah, took over the direct government of his mainland territory and also succeeded in establishing themselves in Sirri, one of his three islands. They made claims and indeed some half hearted efforts to establish themselves also in Tamb, but never succeeded in doing so. The island of Tamb in fact came under the rule of the Jowasimi Sheikh at Ras-al- Khaimah and Abu-Musa under that of the Sheikh at Sharjah. These two sheikhdoms were re-united from 1900 to about 19S0, but then again separated, and after the separation the division of the two islands between the two sheikhdoms was the same as before. In view of the separation of the two principalities, it would seem to me to be difficult to argue that the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah has since 1920 ruled any of his territories as a representative of a family which included the entirely separate sheikhdom of Sharjah or vice versa. 7. My conclusion is that, unless further evidence is forthcoming indicating that it can b e proved that during the period 1880-1887 the Sheikh at Lingah ruled the islands under some title different from that under which he ruled the main land (I doubt if it will be easy to show this), the Persians did possess sovereignty over Tamb and Abu-Musa during these years, but that now the Sheikhs of Ras-al-Khaimah and Sharjah respectively/respectively have a prescriptive title against Persia of about 48 years 1 duration and that in fact it is this title and t his a l one on which we or they must rely against Persia. The question, therefore, really is whether 48 years' occupation is sufficient to create a title to sovereignty as against the previous sovereign who at any rate has never formally waived his claim and has made some efforts, though intermittent and feeble, to assert and enforce his claim. I do not think it would be possible to say with absolute certainty whether a court would hold that this period is sufficient to create a title to the islands in the Trucial Sheikhs and in the United Kingdom as their suzerain. There is no definite period for the acquisition of a title by prescription in international lav/. Prescription is clearly recognised as a source of title to sovereignty and the length of the period of occupation has to be taken into account with all the other circumstances of the case. Taking all the circumstances of this case into consideration, including the fact that Persian sovereignty, if it ever existed over the islands, came to them only because the Jowasimi Sheikh at Lingah became their vassal for a short period of years and was never effectively exercised except through him as their vassal and ceased to be exercised at all in fact when they turned out their vassal from Lingah, the islands then reverting to their previous sovereign, I think it is quite likely that a court would uphold the title of the Trucial Sheikhs* But it would be difficult to oe quite certain upon this point. 8* It may be well to consult the Law Officers on this question/question and if this is done the reference will have to include all the authorities that can he collected on the question of prescription.

Thi^ ARAB CUSTOM Ob' HOLDING PriOx^riTY M IN CO^,QN n . « f- &lt;e 1» The subject is not an easy one ana much, no doubt, could be written about it, if one had the leisure* Putting the case as shortly as possible, however, one may say that land is held in the Arabian reninsular under two main systems: (a) That of private ownership; (b) That of Tribal ownership* II. Under system (&amp;) which is confined almost entirely to the settled or Town population of Arabia, an individual buys or inherits his lands in the first place, (it may also be a bequest) and on his death, it (the lana) must according to 'Sheria' Law, be divided among his heirs. The males getting so many shares and the females ditto. III. These heirs hov/ever very often arrange among themselves, for either political or ’’family protective reasons”, not to divid the property, and elect to leave it in thehands oi the seniv-i member of the family to be administered and managed as the lattei considers fit, they the heirs getting their individual rights in the shape of fixed share of the produce, or a salary, or both* So long as the property is administered reasonably well and individuals are properly treated, the system works saoxs- factorily. But should the reverse take place, then there is trouble as division into fair shares often becomes a most difficult matter, especially after several generations have held the property without dividing it* The same ’’protective instinct” which tends to keep property in the hands of the head of the family, can similarly be traced in the age long ana practically universal system among Arabs (especially the tribes) of first cousin marriages - the idea being to prevent the girl going away from the family, ox U ' u °- L _ tribe, /tribe,and so taking her share 01 the property with her, which would inevitably ena in weakening the family or home tribe (hamoula). IV. Kuwait we have many examples of this joint possession of property, notably the date gardens of the Shaikhly house or the Al Subah on the Shatt al Arab, which by consent of the whole family, have been managed and administered for many years by the Ruler aims eIf. The same system is today also in existence in Riath, where I understand Bin Saud looks after the garden and house property of all the members of the Al Saud family, and the same also was the fashion during Turkish times among the great families of the Al Saadun and Naqibs of Basra. V. It should never be forgotten however that according to the strict letter of the Sheria Law the system is wi on^ (^usi like the veiling og women), and any individual, v/ho happens to be dissatisfied with his lot, can theoretically claim to be give his lawful share of the family property, whatever it be and at any time. In practice it is not so easy, especially when the family as a whole has approved the system, or the head ox house happens to be a ruler of a State like Bin Saud, the Imam Yahya, or Ibn Subah. VI. It is quite clear that the system oi trying to keep hie family property together, originated in the days when anarchy x and disorder existed in Arabia, and when it was necessary ana very essential to keep the family strong, for protective purposes. We see signs of the same fear in the fortress like way all Arab houses are built (i.e. the absence of all outside windows and the small door in the centre of the big door). VII. It is further quite clear also that the system is so deeply rooted in the heart of every Arab, as to be at once his strength and his weakness - his strength because it keeps the-3- family life healthy and strong, his v/eakness because it teaches him to believe that all Kings, Governments etc. as we know them are tyrannous and hostile always to individual interests, i-, m other words, tends to perpetuate the patriarchal or tribal system, which admits only theShaikh or the head of the family (Lamoula) as the authority to be obeyed. Hence the perpetual hostility, for instance, of the tribes of Araoia, to being ruled by a h_ng line Bin Baud, and hence the lack of ’'patriotism 1 * as we know it, and the impossibility of getting tribes ever to co-operate together in big or small things - the beginning and end of a man's ideas qix life being the family and the tribe. VIII* To turn now to system (b) - see paragraph i ^bov^. A 'tribe' always owns its grazing and tribal lanas (including wells eta)jointly, and never individually. And in consequence the tribe as a whole jealously guard its possessions against aggression from outside tribes. Under the system the position of the tribal boundaries are known exactly, by every man woman and child, and are handed down from father to son. Wells also are more often than not marked with tribal mark (Wasm) in similar way to their camels. The Shaikh of the tribe may of course detail certain wells ^ and grazing areas during the summer months to certain sections and families of the tribe, as he thinks fit, but this is purely for convenience sake. Ke may of course not sell or part with any portion of the tribe’s lands or grazing grounds to anyone. .Very „ mn'-' tribes lands are his 'true • man knows this. The tiioos xanoi _ IX . Under the same system, if a neighbouring tribe, on fnen terms, happens to be short of grazing in its own country, it - always permitted to enter the tribal lands of ius neighbour payment of a nominal tribute to the Shaikh of the tribe acting the tart of 'host'. This (although Bin Saud and other «rab rulers in their efforts to europeanise their states are trying ,IS to stop it and replace it by 'zikat' to the Central Government) known under the name of 'Dhabiha wa kaniha 11 . It is a very ancient custom indeed* and entitles the visitors to full protection, whilst sojourning in their neighbours land, even against enemy raiders, or the police activities of the King or Central Govern ment (such as in Saudi Arabia). This incidentally accounts for the lack of sympathy and almost invariable hostility which Kings like Bin Gaou., Riza Shah, and Governments like Iraq who are trying to run their country on Western lines, feel for the tribes. Tne trioal system is a perpetual thorn in their side. X, only one person can interfere with ac ^ual tribal Jiropei ty, or give it away in Arabia today, namely the 'Ring' or 'Ruler' of the country of which the tribe forms part (e.g.Bin Sana). Such an 'outrage' against tribal feeling and sentiment would however be so widely resented, and be so dangerous, that it is unttunkablj that it would ever be put into practice. FOR y.XAMjrLe; . Bin Saud might want to punish a tribe like the Ajman, and might order the Awazim, their neighbours, to take uVe ‘ half of its grazing lands. The order woulu no doubt be carried out, .just because the King is all powerful, but would remain m force just so long as Bin Saud could enforce the order. All the time the Ajman would be longing for the day when tney would get back their lost lands. The Awazim would equally well realise that they were trespassers on lands which no King on eax ui could give them permanently: they would withdraw as soon as they saw that Bin Saud grew weak or died, as tuej' • ouxo not ordeal of the bitterest of tribal wars that would ensue, with all public opinion(tribal) against them. XI. m the particular case of TA11B Island - ai nough up in events, nor have any knowledge of the question unaer discussion, I should say that the Island was either owned /owned by the Jov/asim tribe as a whole, just like the Mutair own the M SuInman ,, region North of the Dahana, and so could, not be given away or* sold without the consent ox the whole tribe, which it is most unlikely would ever be given, or that it was the personal property (acquired) by oonquest or purchase originally) of the actual Shaikhly iamily of the Jowasim. In which case the Shaikh as the head ox the -amily and trustee would be quite unable to part with the whole or part of it, without first obtaining the consent of the other members of the family - also an unlikely contingency, unless a sulxicien ly good price were offered as an inducement* sd.

At the same time I think I ought to explain that we are only concurring in this draft reluctantly, as we still feel that the policy which it represents is a dangerous one and may well land us eventually in serious difficulties. Apart from the question of the legal position - which I will deal with separately later - we still feel very doubtful as to the wisdom of our adopting, at this stage, a policy which may result in our finding /ourselves G. Laithwaite, Esq., C.I.Eourselves prematurely eommitted to protect for all time and against all comers the rights of the Sheikh of Sharjah, in an island which he has not himself held for many years and which, in any case, seems likely to prove of negligible value; while if the island has any political value, we may be missing an exceptionally favourable opportunity of acquiring it for ourselves. Had we been able to take over the island temporarily ourselves, we should at least have had time to consider our whole future policy towards it in the light of our own best ultimate interests before, so to speak, burning our boats. But we realize that the fact that the Sheikh of Sharjah has apparently as good a title to the island as the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, does give him a sort of right of reversion to it, and that we might have considerable difficulties on the Arab coast if we were to ignore his rights particularly as I understand he is vigorously pressing them. We therefore do not feel able /toto press our point further at present, and are prepared to acquiesce in the policy recommended hy the Middle East Official Sub-Committee.

(&amp;?/ THE SUB-COIvMITTEE had lender consideration - Copy of a letter with enclosures from Mr« J 0 C. Laithwaite, India Office, to the Secretary of the Sub-Committee (paper No. M.B«(0) IPS). THE CHAINMiVN asked Mr. Laithwaite to give the India Office view on the situation at Tamh resulting from the action circulated with Paper No. M.E.(O) 178, MR. IAITH7/AITE said that the Foreign Office had thought it desirable that the question of Tamb should be discussed reaction on the Persian negotiations, in which it had in the past from time to time figured prominently. After giving a short geographical description ©f the island and referring to its history and status, he aa id that the causes leading up to the present situation were clearly set out in the telegrams circulated with Paper M.EyO) 178. The title to the island rested in the two Jowasimi Sheikhs of Ras-al-hhaimah and Sharjah, but since 1921 Ras-al-Khaimah had been definitely the senior partner. No forces were maintained on the island, but there was a lighthouse (the right to erect which had been granted to His Majesty’s Government by Sharjah in 1912). Under instructions issued locally the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah was required to keep his flag flying on the island and to maintain a man as a guard. At the end of December the Senior Naval Officer had reported that the flag had been removed and the guard withdrawn. The reasons for the Sheikh’s action were still not clear, but the explanations given suggested that they were: (a) that he wished to blackmail us into paying some rent for the lighthouse;('b) that he was in negotiation either with the Central Persian Government or (more probably) with local Persian officials on the South Persian Coast. The Sheikh r s action had not been well taken in his Sheikhdom or locally and the Sheikh of Sharjah, immediately on hearing of the withdrawal of the flag, had asked permission to hoist his own flag and had beer? dissuaded from doing so only by the Residency Agent, It was now necessary to take a decision as to the course of action to be followed. The alternatives appeared to be: (a) to request the Sheikh to replace his flag and offer to pay him a rent in respect of the lighthouse; (b) to refuse to be blackmailed and to require him to replace his flag within a given number of days, failing which His Majesty's Government y/ould take such action as they thought fit; (c) to allow the -Sheikh of Sharjah to hoist his flag on the understanding that he would keep it hoisted and maintain a guard; urof ^icia 1 1 v (d) A suggestion which had beon/put forward by the Foreign Office - that His Majesty's Government should annex the island, either permanently or temporarily, the argument being used that the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaiinah under his treaties f had no power to cede it except to His Majesty s Government?and that if he evacuated it they were entitled to step in. Sir Samuel Hoare's view was that the first alternative could be ruled out; that there were strong objections (which the Political Resident shared) to the fourth alternative; and that the right course was a combination of the second and third, the Sheikh being required to replace his flag within a given number of days, failing which the Sheikh of Sharjah would be allowed to hoist his flag. It was relevant that theflag flown 'by Sharjah ana Ras-al-Khaimah was the same, MR. LAITHWAITR said that as regards the informal Foreign Office suggestion^ the India Office fully appre ciated the importance of the point made by the Minister at Tehran as to the undesirability of any apparent change of ownership while negotiations with Persia were still under consideration. On the other hand, the objections to the suggestion which had been put forward were very strong. It w^ould not put us in any way in a better position vis-a-vis Persia; it would cause trouble with the Trucial Sheikhs, who would accuse us of land-grubbing; and finally it would affect our relations with the Sheikh of Sharjah, who had a legitimate claim to the island and who had been r estrained from asserting that claim only by our local agent, and who had of course given us considerable assistance inJealing with the air route. It seemed clearly desirable to take an immediate decision; the island had now been left without a flag for two or three months, and this situation could not be permitted to continue during the progress of negotiations. THE CHAIRMAN said that as the possibility of annexation had been suggested by the Foreign Office, he would like to have Mr. Rendel T s views.-16- MR. RLMDiiii in reply said that he h^d not yat been able to submit this question to his higher authorities^ and he therefore had no instructions on the subject. He had however suggested that it should be discussed by the oub-Committee as it seemed desirable to explore the ground au once 3 particularly in view of the possibility of the problem assuming considerable importance in the near future. He felt that the problem should be looked at in its widest aspect. The difficulties of our present position in the Gulf were mainly due to our having failed to take a decisive line when it was open to us to do so. Had we regularised our position by definitely annexing certain key positions in the Gulf when we could have had them for the a axing early in the 19th century 9 or even in 1857 3 half our present troubles would never have occurred, iho first point for consideration in the present case seemed to him to be to decide whether the island of Tamb was of any possible value or importance to us strategically or otherwise. If it was likely to be of value 9 we now seemed to have an exceptionally favourable opportunity of establish ing 1 our oosit ion there on a regular basis. COMM-AlTDilR .DICKSON said that from the Admiralty point of view iamb Was only important on account of the lighthouse^ wnich 9 oi course 9 was necessary for navigation purposes generally 9 and not solely for Admiralty requirements. The island could not be used for any other purposes. There was no harbour and it was not a possible base. The Admiralty wou-td like go see the question settled and to rid themselves of an extra commitment caused by the S.N.O, having to keep a sloop in the vicinity of Tambo-17- \vING COMMA.i'GDER FIR IE stated that this island had no direct interest for the Air Ministry. MR. SEAL said that the Admiralty could not contemplate this island being handed over to Persia. It did not matter to them which Sheikh controlled the island^ but he could not see any adequate reason for annexation s nor did he see how annexation could improve our position in the Persian G-ulf. tie did not want any more incidents like that at BasidUj; where the British flag had been left unguarded and had been insulted by the Persians. Proceeding^ MR. RENDEL said that he had put the question about the importance of the island so that we might if possible avoid missing yet another opportunity of establishing ourselves in a souna and legally defensible position in a place which we might subsequently find was essential to us. If Tarnb were of really important strategic valuej, now was our chance to take it over. The Sheikh of Ras-alAKhaimah had violated his treaty with us by virtually withdrawing from the island and leaving it to be taken over by the first comer. Whether he had intrigued with the Persians or not 9 there was lit ole doubt that if vie had not kept a sloop there the Persians could have acquired it. The Sheikh had undertaken not to alienate any part of his territory except to his Majesty’s Government. his Majesty’s Government therefore seemed in a very strong position to take over the island if they wanted to. On the other hands if the island really were of no value or in terest to us £ the fact that the Sheikh had virtually dis interested himself in it seemed to give us an opportunity of utilising it for some political purpose. Before no?/ attempts to reach a general settlement with Persia had broken down mainly on the question of this island. If it were really of no value c, and we did not want to keep it ?-18- and the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah was indifferent to it ? was it really worth allowing our relations with Persia to be vitiate! by our obligation to protect an island of no value which no one really wanted? Might it not be better policy for us to take over the island now ourselves s so that we should at least be free to use it if it should prove desirable as part of a bargain with Persia under which Persia would,, for instance j abandon her claims to Bahrein s etc. , recognise the Arab rulers of the Gulf and our special relations with them, and generally undertake not to be obstructive to us in the Gulf? Would it not be a mistake to renew our embarrassing commitment to protect it for an Arab ruler who cared little about it and to whom we owed so little? It was for these reasons that he had put forward, as a purely personal suggestion, the idea that we might take advantage of the Sheikh Ox nao al Khaimah's apparent indifference to the island to take over the island, either to keep, if it were of value, or to use as a counter in negotiation, if it should prove valueless. He did not suggest that we should necessarily formally annex the island. His idea was rather that we should take it over for the time being and decide subsequently what to do with it. As regards handing it over to Sharjah, he emphasised that the Sheikh of Sharjah had never been mentioned in any of the correspondence with the Persians during the last five or six years as having any claim or title to the island. On the contrary, we had insisted very surongly on the fact that the island was a possession of the Sheikh of Ras-al -Khaimah. He feared that our position v - s - ^ the Persians might be somewhat embarrassing if we now suddenly took the line that the island was the property of someone else. Obis would not of course have been the case if we had told the Persians from the first that the island was not the personal property of the Sheikh of *Ras-al-Khaimah 'but a sort of trust possession of the Jowasimi trihe,, hut ue had never done this. He still felt 5 therefore^ that there might he a good deal to he said for our taking it over ourselves * though he did not want to press this suggestion unduly s particularly as it was &lt;, as he had explained^ only a purely personal one. Thh CHAIRMAN referred to the telegram from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran dated 8 th Hehruary* 1935* in which the Minister stated that our control would he strengthened hy adopting the suggestion of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* which was that the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah should he ordered to replace the flag within a stated period and if he failed to comply* then the Sheikh of Sharjah should he authorised to take this action® He thought that the Sheikh of Sharjah had a very good claim* and he did not see that it should he difficult to explain the 'posiAi 011 to the Persian Government* to 'whom there had heen no occasion to mention the Sheikh of Sharjah’s reversionary rights while the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah was in occupation of the island. MR. LAITHwAITE pointed out* firstly* that the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah could hardly he regarded as having violated, any treaty engagement hy this action* while* in so far as the Jowasimi sheikhs were concerned* Sharjah had applied to he allowed to hoist his flag immediately on the Ras-al-Khaimah only hy His Majesty’s Government’s local representative. Secondly* that if tjq permitted the Sheikh of Sharjah to hoist the flag instead of Sheikh Ras-al-Khaimah* no change view of the fact that Sharjah had a good title to the island (though he had in practice now for many years heen so much flag heing hauled down* and had heen prevented from doin^ so of ownership of the island would he involved* as Loth Sheikhs belonged to the Jowasimi tribe and each had an interest in the island and each flew the same flag. j the junior partner that that title had not been of any -19-importance until the present juncture) there seemed everything to he said for letting him take over. In reply to a question, lie sadd that our general principle in this area was not to interfere in the internal affairs of the Sheikhs more than we could help and not to endeavour to holster up Sheikhs who were not strong enough to stand on their own. So far as their external relations were concerned, our principal concern was to ensure that they had no dealings with any foreign powers and that they did not sell or cede any territory save to His Majesty’s Government. COLONEL ADAM said he was in entire agreement with the India Office views. CONC LUSION (IT) . THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed - (a) To recommend that His Majesty’s Government should not agree to payment of rent to the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah for the lighthouse on the island of Tamh or to any other financial inducement to him to re-hoist his flag,; (b) That there were objections to the temporary or permanent occupation of Tamb by His Majesty’s Government in view of the claims of the Sheikh of Shar j ah; (c) That in the circumstances they recommend that the Sheikh of P.as-al-Khaimah should be re quired to re-hoist his flag and replace the guard within a period of ten days, failing which His Majesty’s Government should authorise the Sheikh of Sharjah to hoist his flag, on the understanding that he will keep it hoisted and maintain a guard. The Resident in the Persian Gulf to be left discretion as to whether the ultimatum to Ras-al-Khaimah should contain - (i) a warning that failing compliance the Sheikh of Sharjah v/ill be allowed to hoist his flag; or (ii) a statement that His Majesty’s govern ment will take such action as they think fit; If the Resident chooses alternative (ii) he should let it be known locally simultaneously with the issue of the ultimatum that the intentions of His Majesty’s Government are as laid down in alternative (i).

Previous Papers 1140 1000 8.32— 2956 6000 7 34 Minute Paper, political Department, The Island of Tamb is the property of the Jowasimi sheikhs of the Arab Shore, viz. the sheikh of Shargah and the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah. For several years now the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah has been the senior partner, but without prejudice to the rights of the sheikh of shargah. A lighthouse is maintained on the island in respect of which no rent is paid to the sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah by and in accordance with instructions given some time ago the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah has flown his flag and maintained a guard on the, island. This precaution is desirable because of the Persian claim and the risk that if no flag was flying and no guard maintained the Persians might endeavour to seize it as they did the adjoining island of Sirri in 1887. a. The sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah has always been most difficult to deal with. His mentality is lower it appears even than that of the ordinary Trucial ruler; he is suspicious, ignorant, obstructive, and very apprehensive of designs on his independence. 3. The Naval Commander-in-Chief reported on 31st December that the sheikh had hauled down his flag on the Island of Tamb and had withdrawn his guard. Telegrams from the Resident confirmed this and stated that opinion in Ras-al-Khaimah was opposed to the Sheikh's action. The sheikh of shargah was anxious to h hoise his own flag and take possession of the island so and had been dissuaded from doing/only by the Residency Agent, subsequent telegrams shewed that there was some reason to believe that correspondence might have passed between the Persian Government (or local/- 3 - (3 2956 6000 7 34 Arab s/ Minute Paper. Department. just arrived on leave. I suggest that they are quite decisive to any occupation hy us. 6 . As regards course (h), one must give weight to the Minister* s representations. On the other hand, the position is slightly eased hy the fact that the flag flown hy the two sheikhs is the same and that while we have in the past dealt with Ras-al-Khaimah as the senior partner and as the only person entitled to effective consideration in regard to disposal of the Island, there is no reason why, if he wishes to dissociate himself from it, we should not now deal with shargah and explain the position to the Persians^. The point is one on which any friendly settlement with the Persians is most unlikely, whoever the ruler of the island may he. As regards course (c), there seem very strong objections of principle to allowing ourselves to he blackmailed hy the sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah and I suggest that we need not consider this possibility any further. 8 . course (d), in all the circumstances, seems to me to he the right one. It is true that it is open /L) to the objection discussed in paragraph 4 ^. But it is quite possible that if we issue an ultimatum in these terms to the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah (who, Mr. Worth tells me, is not understood to have any support in his town) his position locally may become so difficult that he will without more ado replace the guard and the flag. If he does not, then our action in acceding to the sheikh of Shargah's request to be allowed to hoist 1 the Jowasimi flag on his own behalf will not be misunderstood. So far as the effect on the local- 4 - Arabs is concernea, there can be no suggestion of lana grabbing on our part, nor woulu the unfortunate effect be produced which would certainly result from any payment,in these circumstances, of rent for the lighthouse to the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah. j submit that I may be authorised to adopt course (d) in the forthcoming meeting of the Middle East committee.

TLe tiallicose suggostion of trie Foreign Office that we should annex the Island amuses me very much: I wish that, see my remarks above, they would 'be bellicose at the right time. I am glad you opposed this suggestion. I see nothing in its favour and much against it. Vis-a-vis the Persians it would put us in a worse and not a better position, and would nave distinctly a bad effect on the Trucial Coast, not only with Sharjah but with all the other shaikhs, who would look upon it as a piece of ‘land graphing* pure and simple. One of the main difficulties, for instance, in obtaining air facilities on the Arab Coast is the suspicion that these facilities are merely the first step towards British occupation. The shaikhs are now, as I pointed out in my despatch on policy on the Trucial Coast, getting over that fear, but an annexation of Tamb would revive it to the full and make us most unpopular.INDIA OFPICK, '.HITDHAL 3. * • 1. 5Ul March 1935. Dear The Foreign Office have suggested that the opportunity of the meeting of the official fiddle East Sud-C ommittea at 3.30 p*m. on Friday, 8 th March, to uiecuss the Transjordan-jaudi Arabian Frontier, should he taken to dispose of a question in connection #lth the Islarid of Tamb in the Persian Gulf, and Parkinson has written to say that he sees no objection to this and to suggest that we should arrange direct with you about it. 2 . I now enclose a copy of correspondence (vide attached list) for circulation to the interested departments. I might add that the earlier history of the T&amp;iib question and of the title to Tamb of the Jow&amp;simi cheikhs is discussed in the article on Iamb, Abu J.usa and cirri In F«G«13, while the gist of the discussions which have taken place in the course of tiie Persian negotiations and the point reached in those negotiations/ Mger P.3.

A point which is relevant to the decision to he taken is that the shaikh of sharg&amp;h and the sheikh of Ras-al-Khaiffiah both fly the saiee flag, viz. tho flag prescrihed hy the General 'frucial Treaty of 1820 - shite pierced red. In 1907 sir Percy Oox failed to induce the remaining aieikhs of the Trucial coast to fly the Treaty flag for the reason that it is regarded on tiie 'frucial Coast as being exclusively the jowaBimi flag. In the event of a decision to allow Ohargah, if :{as-al-Khaiffiah refused to cooperate, to use his flag, the actual flag hoisted would thus be the saxe, though it would, of course, be hoisted under ah&amp;rgah’e i uthorlty and not under that of ^as-al-Khain.ah.

The subject is the Trans—Joroan Saudi—xirabia frontier. When talking with Rendel about this, he mentioned another sub ject^which will have to come before the Sub-Committee some time, and he suggested that I might ask you whether you thought we could also fit in Tamb. I gather that it is a case in which there is a certain conflict of opinion between the India Office and the Foreign Office. If you think it desirable to try to fit in Tamb at the same meeting, perhaps you would let Webb know direct and arrange, in conjunction with the Foreign Office, for any necessary papers to be sent to Webb for circulation before the meeting.

The Honourable the political Resident , Bush ire (N0.42/573A). VISIT OB’ PERSIAN WAB VTCSSELS TO TJNB ISLAND. At IB00 on 28th August 1934, whilst SHOREHAM was towing target for BIDEFORD in position about 4 1 North of Little Tunb Island on a course heading for Great Tunb Island, the Persian ship PALAHG was sighted S.40 E. steering approximately N.E. and as we thought making for Bandar Abbas. Visibility was very good. 2. At 1835 PALANG was lost to sight at a distance of about eight miles and BIDEFOBD was sent to verify her course while SHORE HAM hauled up the targets. BT'DEFOBD reported that PALANG had anchored on the East side oi Great Tunb Island (away from both lighthouse and village) about 1900. 3. 3H0REHAM, with BIDEFOKP in company, proceeded towards this anchorage. It was now dark and at about 2024 PALANG’s lights opened up. SHOREHAM and BTDEFOKD anchored two cables South of PALANG. 4. No boat had visited the village. A dhow was seen to be at anchor about 5 or 6 cables to N.W. ol PALANG close inshore. She was showing a white light when first sighted but ten minutes later it was extinguished. ^nis is quite normal in such places for dhows do not generally exhibit lights after their evening meal. 5, After anchoring I sent my stall ofiicer to PALkNO where he met Lieutenant-Colonel Bayendor. The Commandant was told that I was surprised to see him there as he had not given the notification of visit required by the i*rab Shaikhs. 6 6. Bayendor also expressed surprise saying that he had always considered Tunb to be a Persian island and that this was the first time he had heard that it was claimed by the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah. He was told that the Persian Government had been informed that the Arab Shaikhs required notification of such visits but replied that he was badly informed by his own Government. He stated that PALANG had come from Kais Island and had only come in to anchor tor the night and intended to proceed for Bandar Abbas next day. Bayendor, who seemed nervous said he would like to see me the next morning when he could explain the circumstances of his visit. He also volunteered the information that he had been away on duty at Tehran and returned only a fortnight previously. It was arranged that exchange of calls should take place next day.7. As it appeared that EaLAHG had arrived from the direction of Abu Musa BIDEFORD was despatched early next morning to ascertain whether she had been there. T was informed later that PALANG had not been seen and had not visited that Island. 8. Bayendor came to SHOBEHAM at 0815. Though he was very affable and very talkative he still seemed to be somewhat nervous. I waited patiently for him to ofier the explanation he said he wished to make the previous evening but after a visit of over an hour, though he spoke of many things he did not bring up the subject. As he was leaving the ship I saw him look at the gun on the Quarterdeck, which was not there on his previous visit to the ship, and told him it was a very good one. Bayendor remarked that it would spoil our Quarter deck as a dance floor to which I replied that perhaps a gun might be more useful. I arranged to return his call a quarter of an hour after he left. 9. I arrived in PALANG at 0945. This call was received in the same friendly spirit. After a short time, as Bayendor again did not broach the subject, I told him we were very surprised to see him anchor at Tunb and that I understood he^ had expressed a desire the night before to explain his position. He reiterated what he had told my Staff Officer the previous evening. I pointed out to him that the Persian Government were lust informed only about a year ago as the result of PALANG's visit to Tunb in August 1933 when he himself was on board. He claimed that as early as May, 1933, the Persian Government had notified us that they intended to visit Tunb lighthouse. _ All mention of Tunb Island itself had been purposely omitted as the Persians considered the island theirs. Tue lighthouse itself admittedly belongs to the British as they had built it and maintained it. Bayendor himself obviously thought this rather lame, and did not really expect me to believe it. I told him quite clearly that we have Treaties with the Trucial Shaikhs who look to us to protect them and to uphold their interests. I added that these Rulers of very small States are naturally particular regarding the customary observances, and wish to be notified of the visits of foreign warships. Bayendor said that he would inform his Government and obtain instructions from them. „ ^ I left at 1015, saying that T would not delay him further as I knew he wished to get to sea. It was perfectly clear to Bayendor that aggression by Persian ships would not be tolerated. He appeared grateful under the circumstances .hat the meetings had otherwise been very friendly. 10. pALANG proceeded to weigh at about 1100, followed a few minutes later by SH0REHAM* 11. Tunb Island was again visited on 30th August. The Headman, Mahmood, reported to me that the dhow which ha anchored on the east side of the islann had been boarded y PALANG. As his information did not sound accurate LUPIN sent to Debai to obtain accurate information and her xeport is attached. Mahmood stated he did not inform SH 0 BEHAM as he was not aware, until after our departure, that the dhow was boarded. I think thfe is correct as the dhow was not in sLg t of the village. IE. On 11th September Tunb was again visited by CHAHR0KH. The report of BIDEF0P.D on this incident is attached. 13. It was obvious that CHAHRGKH had been sent for a specific purpose. I was confident that she would not attempt anyany form of aggression which would necessitate the use of force, and that nothing would be done in the island in the way of infringing the sovereignty of the Shaikh which it would have been possible for one of Ships to rectify on arrival. I had a strong feeling that the intention was to kidnap Mahmood and possibly claim him as the Persian subject who had deserted. 'Fhis feeling I subsequently found was shared by Captain Browne, the Commanding Officer of H.M.S. BIDSfOBB, who was on the spot and consequently in a better position to know. 14. 'The P ALA NO returned to Abadan on 8th September. On 17th September she was again reported as having left for sea. X also had verbal information from the Port Authori ties that BABK was preparing for sea. PALANO-, however, returned to Mohammerah on the 18th September* I subse quently learned that when PA LANG- had arrived a couple of miles beyond the Shatt-el-Arab light vessel she anchored for about two or three hours and then returned up river. When I passed down river on 20th September X learned from the Mohammerah Bar pilot that the BABB was then under normal conditions and not expected to go to sea immediately* The suggestion is that certain orders were received and subse quently cancelled. 15. At no time during this period did I anticipate that it would be necessary to resort to the use of force, provided that we were in a position to use it if need he - which of course we were. Nevertheless the authority to do so if absolutely necessary was, I am sure, most reassuring to commanding Officers of ships of the Persian Gulf Division. 16. In view of Foreign Office telegrams No.91 to 93 and 95, I believe that there is likely to be no further incident at Tunb or Abu Musa for a time and tnat if the Persians wish to be provocative they will find some other method. They are most unlikely to take any steps which they know will cause us to take effective measures. (Signed) J. V. C B B A G H. CAPTAIN, SENIOR NAVAL OFFICER, PERSIAN GULF.VISII?

Details of this incident were reported in BTDEPCRD’S signals 2345/11 and 0131/12. 3. There is little to add to these reports. 4. Copies of rough report of Officer of the Guard of H.M.S. LUPIN, and of Sub. Lieutenant Groome, H.M.S. LUPIN are attached. 5. Shortly after 0.0.G. from H.M.S. LUPIN left CHABOSH she was heard making a cypher message, a copy of which is attached. 6. The Commanding Officer of CHAROKH seemed to me to rather resent being told that it was against the Sheikh’s wishes that foreign men-of-war should visit these Islands without notification, and said he had to carry out his orders and did not know any notification was necessary* His programme was issued by Bayendor, but he would not say what his future programme was . 7. when I ret urned Command ing Off icer ’ s call on board CHAROKH at 0800 on 12th September, he still would not tell me when he would leave Tunb. 8. I had MAHM00B on board BTDEB0RD at 0930, 12th September, but he had nothing to add to information already given to Sub. Lieutenant Groome, 9. In order to avoid having to follow CHkROKH should she get under way and proceed to South Westward, I proceeded at 1030 and anchored off Eastern side of Bu Musa, leaving H.M.S. LUPIN to watch events at Tunb. 10* CHAHB0KH got under way at 0455, 13th September, and proceeded to Westward* The Commanding Officer H.M.S. LUPIN sent s Signalman up to the Lighthouse to make sure she really left the vicinity. The Lighthouse keeper reported that she passed close South of Little Tunb and disappeared to Westward. Visibility was maximum.11. H.M.S. LUPIN weighed at 0751 and after circling Little Tanb, proceeded to join me at Bu Musa. X have the honour to be. Sir, Your obedient servant.

The Officer of the Guard then said he was surprised at finding a Persian Gunboat anchored off Tunb without previous notification and referred in the sense of Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf f s recent cypher. The Commanding Officer replied that Bayendor had told him nothing about the conversation between Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf and Bayendor and his orders were to visit Tunb and that he was a Naval Officer and had to carry out his orders. The Officer of the Guard asked for what purpose a boat had been landed at Tunb and the Captain said at first that it was necessary and then the First Lieutenant chipped in and said they had to get provisions. In the course of the conversation the Commanding Officer did not refer to Persian ownership of Tunb. The Officer of the Guard said that Commanding Officer H.M.S. LUPIN would be glad to see the Commanding Officer if he could call, to which he replied that, as this question, i.e., being at Tunb had been raised he felt it would be better to waive official etiquette. On the other hand he would be very glad to see the Commanding Officer of H.M.S. LUPIN if he cared to call.SECRET EH CLOSURE HO. 2 TO 'STDEPORir S' COMMUHICATIOH H0.50/67E DATED 13th SEPTEMBER, 1934. Report by Sub, Lieutenant D. Grroome. R.H. - 11/9/34 . The Sub. Lieutenant with Interpreter landed at Tunb Island about 1730 on 11th September. They proceeded to the village and met MAHMOOD and his relation MAHOMED bin Ali bin SALMAN who were both interrogated with reference to the Persian landing during the afternoon; they gave the following information. At about 1445 the Lighthouse keeper sighted the Persian Gunboat ”CHAHRQKH', who was on passage from LINGER to Tunb Island. The 'CHAHKGKH” anchored off the village at about 1530, and immediately lowered their boat and landed ashore one Persian rating (described wearing a Seaman's cap). The Persian walked up to the village and then met MAHOMED; shortly afterwards they were joined by MAHMOOD, who, after exchanging greetings with the Persian went away. MAHOMED however, had a long talk with the Persian, who first of all enquired where the Custom House was. Mahomed replied that Tunb Island had no Custom House nor any soldiers as in Persia, because Tunb Island belonged to the Sheikh of HAS AI KHAIMAH and he (the Sheikh) has MAHMOOD there as his represent at ive. The Persian then asked MAHOMED if he would come out in the Motor boat and 'show him the harbour'. MAHOMED replied that he was a landsman and would have a headache (be seasick). The Persian countered by asking MAHOMED if he would come off to the 'CHAHROKH', but MAHOMED replied No., whereupon the Persian suggested that MAHOMED was afraid. He replied by saying 'why should he be afraid as he was a man, the Persian was a man, and everybody on board was a man' (i.e., he - MAHOMED - was just as good as any of them). The Persian realising that MAHOMED would not come off with him in the Motor boat, said goodbye and walked back alone to the boat. BothMAHMOOD and MAHCMED saw the boat leave the shore for the 'CHaHROKH' shortly afterwards. The Persian did not attempt to buy any provisions while ashore, it is estimated the boat left the Gunboat at about 1530, returning about 1700. The Lighthouse was not visited. Sub-Lieutenant Groome told MAHMOOD that he might be wanted to report on board to-morrow (12th September) morning, and it was arranged that he would be down by the shore close to the village at 0900. MAHMOOD also stated that the Island had not been \ visited and he had nothing to report since the TpaLANG* 1 and 'SHOREHAM' had last been at Tunb Island. \\ ^ VFHOM ... DATE ... TO .....

LUPIN arrived at BABA I on Friday, 31st August at 1850 and the Resident Agent together with HUSSEIN came on board at 2100. The Resident Agent was asked to obtain what information he could in connection with the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf's signal 19453/30/8/34 and return to LUPIN with the Shaikh, who had arranged to call on the Commanding Officer next day. 3. The dhow concerned returned to BABAI at daylight (1st September) and the Narkuda and two of the crew came on board in the boat that brought off the Shaikh, who called at 0900. Later in the forenoon I returned his call. 4. After hearing the stoiies of the Narkuda and his crew, all of whom were interrogated on 1st and 2ftd September, it has been possible to build up the following narrative which outlines what occurred more or less accurately. NARRATIYE . 5. Four dhows were chartered by a merchant in BABAT to proceed to BU MUSA to fetch stone required for building. They sailed in company from BABAT before sunset on Saturday 25th August. At dawn next morning, the Narkuda of one of these dhows, who could not sail as fast as the other three, found that they were out of sight. These three dhows eventually arrived at BU MUSA anchoring there probably on Sunday night. 6. This single dhow which was owned by the B.T. clerk at BABAI met with calms and varying winds and her position at sunset on Sunday was approximately Lat. 28 u 28 M N, Long.55° 20' E. 7. Next day, monday, once again she was becalmed until after noon, when a light wind sprang up. Just before sunset the Narkuda sighted high land ahead and finding mud on his lead he knew he was close to ^ISHM Island. He, fearing to be found in Persian waters, 'turned his sail' and made out to sea; his position at dusk on Monday night was roughly Lat.26° 28' N, Long.55 30' E. 8. Next morning he approached the northward of TUNB Island, but the flood tide was too strong for him to make the anchorage so he proceeded to Little TUNB. Later, however, the ebb set in and a light shamal started to blow,■blow, he decided to make TUNB and anchored close inshore off the northeast corner of the island at 1845. 9. Before anchoring he had sighted the PALANS approaching from the westward (uncertain), she turned and dropped her anchor at 1900 astern of the dhow. Before, however, she anchored the launch was lowered and went straight over to the dhow, who was riding to her cable heading due west. 10. Some of the sailors in the launch were armed with rifles but there was no officer in the boat. The Narkuda was told to come back in the launch to the PALANG. 11. When on board he was interviewed by an officer on the quarter deck; from the description he gave it appears that the officer was the captain of that ship. In this interview he was at first accused of smuggling a suggestion which the Narkuda denied adding that the Persians should send on board his dhow and they would see that she was empty. 12. The conversation continued, for what seemed to the Narkuda a long time, the attitude of the Persians becoming friendly. During this conversation the officer joked about the Narkuda being a Persian Arab but not living in Persia and suggested he should go off to LINGEH; he also mentioned that the PALANG and two other Persian ships were patrolling in t he neighbourhood. Finally, as soon as the search party returned from the dhow, the Narkuda was told he could go back and he left the PALANG at 2045 and not 2230 as reported in my HOO/l/9/34. 13. While the Narkuda was on board the PALANG the launch took over a search party who boarded the dhow at 1930. As it was dark the senior hand asked the dhow’s crew for a light and with this they examined the dhow throughout includ ing the sail cover from which the sail had to be withdrawn. The party found only a little tea, sugar and rice and asked the crew how they were going to live with next to nothing on board; they also demanded to see their boxes, in which their clothes were stowed. The crew replied that they were all very poor men and had to do the best they could on the small stock of food on board and had no clothes other than those they were wearing. The search party were satisfied and finally left for the PA LANG at 2030. 14. On the search party returning, the Narkuda was at once sent down to the boAt, which took him back to his dhow. The launch on this and previous occasion used the starboard (northward) side of the dhow; as soon as the Narkuda had disembarked, the launch went back to the PALANG and was immediately hoisted. 15. Neither the Narkuda or any of the crew sighted the lights of SH0K3HAM and BXDEF0RD until they were in the anchorage, which they stated was after the return of the Narkuda. The rattle of the cable when anchoring was also not heard. The stories of the five men were carefully checked concerning this period and the information I have gathered leaves no doubt that the Narkuda had returned to his dhow before the SH0RRHAM and BI DWORD anchored. 16. Many questions were asked in regard to the light in the dhow sighted by SHGRAHAM and reported to have disappeared at 2030. The dhow’s lamp was lit by orders of the search party, used in the search and extinguished after£4 the Narkhuaa fell asleep at about £200. The dhow has been boarded at DABAI and it seems unlikely that this light was visible outside the dhow as it was suspended overhead aft above the Harkuda’s mat and below the awning. 17. The launch however, had a white light burning all the time she was away from the PALANG and it is probable that it was this light which was seen by SHGH15HAM. 18. As soon as the Narkuda saw the two ships anchor, he wondered if they were British. On discussing with his crew the advisability of reporting the occurrence at once, it was decided that these two might be the two Persian ships mentioned by the officer of the PaLAHG, and that rather than risk any more trouble, he would remain where he was, 19. In the morning he had a look at the two ships by daylight, and seeing one with a 'Basket” (target) made fast astern, again suggested they were British. His crew, however, persuaded him they were probably Persian, and as there was no wind and he could not distinguish the flags, he decided not to risk anything by going over to make sure. £0. Later on in the day the dhow sailed round to the village and started to load with stone, when a message came from MAHM00D to say they must stop. MAHM00D then turned up and told the Narkuda that he must pay five rupees for the stone. He replied that he was very poor and had no money, furthermore it was only last night that he had been arrested and his dhow searched by a Persian warship and altogether he was a man to be pitied. 21. The Narkuda was questioned with reference to MAHM00|) r s statement regarding the dhow being towed from Little TUNB to TUNB Island, he denied ever having said such a thing. It seems probable however, that some such statement may have been made by the Narkuda in order to obtain greater sympathy, and, so avoid paying for the stone. 2£. After further discussion the Narkuda told MAHM00D if he insisted on payment he would leave one of his crew behind as security and bring the money on the next trip. MAHMOOD relented end the Narkuda got his stone for nothing. He is now going back for more. general remarks. £3. (i) The Persians suspected the dhow of smuggling (ii) The dhow was searched by an armed guard and the Narkuda was cross examined by the Captain of the PALANG on board his ship. (iii) The Captain of the PALANG probably tried to deceive the Narkuda into thinking that the SHORES AM and BIDEPQRD were Persian ships. (iv) As soon as the SHOBEHAM and BIDEECRB approached the anchorage, the PALANG did everything possible to conceal the fact that the dhow had been boarded. (v) The Narkuda had returned to his dhow and the launch had been hoisted before SHOREHAM anchored. (vi) The Narkuda was dissuaded by his crew from reporting to the SHOREHAM as the ships might be Persians and there was a risk of further trouble.&amp;4* The names of the dhow’s crew who were interrogated are given below* Name.

Personally I do not share Hendel’s apprehensions though there may be grounds for them. The outstanding facts, which are in our favour, appear to be that: (1) The Jowasimi Shaikhs had possession of Tamb and Abu Musa both long before and long after the period when the Shaikh of Lingah (the Chiei Jowasimi Shaikh) was a Persian subject. (2) The Shaikh of Lingah during the time he was a Persian subject only administered the two islands on behalf of the Jowasimi trioe who as a whole, (P.G.13. page 98 paragraph 7), remained on the nrab Coast. (3) The Shaikh of Lingah only paid tribute to the Shah for Lingah not Tamb and Abu Musa. (4) The Persian Authorities would not appear at any time to have exercised any sort of dominion over the two islands.

With regard to other questions to which your Excellency had alluded in your note under reply, as I have already, and on repeated occasions, expressed my views as well as those of my Government on these problems, I hardly need to repeat the same and I hope your Excellency will admit that the assumptions made by His Britannic Majesty’s Government are not in accordance with the facts.

[265 e—2](E 5652/ 3283/ 91) Confidential. * I My dear Gilbert, » # I enclose the draft of a brief note on the history and legal position of Tarab and Abu Musa, which was originally prepared by Dan Lascelles, before he left the department, for the use of our representative at Geneva, in case the Persians should raise the question of their claim during the September meetings of the Council, but which has since been considerably expanded by Baggallay. £. Before I saw this memorandum Dan Lascelles had assured me that the case against the Persians at Tamb was even stronger than at Bahrain, particularly as Persia had ceased to exercise any control at Tamb even earlier than at Bahrain. This tallied with my own recollections of earlier papers, and I have always taken this line in discussing the matter with my Secretary of State. Since G. Laithwaite, Esq. /readingreading througli this draft memorandum, however, I am no longer quite as happy about the position as I was. It seems to me that the fact that the islands were administered for sometime by Jowasimi Sheikhs, who were not only resident in Persia (however they got there) but were Persian subjects (for a time at least) and Persian officials, might easily prove very damaging. It is quite true that these Sheikhs administered these particular islands not in their capacity of Persian officials, but in their capacity of representatives of the Trucial rulers to whom the islands belonged. But this might easily be represented as a rather subtle distinction, and the circumstance that the islands were in actual fact administered by Persian officials from the Persian mainland might well, it seems to me, be quoted against us with rather an unfortunate effect. 2. The point may become of some importance, as there are indications that the Persians may now press their claim to Tamb and possibly to Abu Musa more strongly than in the past. It is just possible even that the Persians may now concentrate on their claim to / iambTamb rather than on their claim to Bahrain, thinking that the former may be a good preliminary for the latter, particularly as at first sight the Persian claim to Tamb is, at any rate from the geographical point of view, nothing like so outrageous as that to an island like Bahrain practically adjoining the Arab coast. lose no time in clearing up any obscurities or uncertainties in our case regarding Tamb, and I should be most grateful if you would look through the present draft memorandum and suggest such alterations and additions as you may think desirable, particularly with a view to meeting the point to which I have drawn attention above. 5. Baggallay suggests that any official information about the Arab custom by which a family such as the Jowasimi hold property in common might be particularly useful. 4 In these circumstances I think we ought to Yours ever,Pers ian Cl aim to Tamb and xxbu Musa . Memora n dum by Mr. Lascelles . The position as regards the Persian claim to the Islands of Tamb and Abu Musa is generally similar to that as regards the Persian claim to Bahrain, Our case, that is to say, rests on the fact that Persia has not exercised effective ^ dominion in these islands for at least 184 years (as against 151 years in the case of Bahrain). It is douotful, indeed, whether even before 1750 she exercised dominion at Tamb and Abu Musa, whereas it is certain that she exercised dominion over Bahrain for a period before 1783. Z. The Persian case has never been put forward systematically, but it is understood to be based on the following two points \ (1) Tamb and Abu Musa were shown as Persian i on a War Office map presented to ‘the Shah in 1888; (2) the Jowasimi Arab sheikhs of % /Lingah vtiie Persian coast), who Lingah (a port on administered iamb and Abu Musa for a long pariod before their final expulsion from rersia I in 1887, were, for a part of that period, , Persian subjects governing Lingah as Persian : officials. The Persian Government are under stood to contend that the Sheikhs administered ! these islands also in their capacity of Persian * 3 * 5 officials. 3. point (1) is unfortunate, but its importance as an argument is largely counter the date on which the map was presented the ' Persian claim was emphatically and officially ? repudiated by His luajesty's Government. this is a complete misconstruction of the facts] which are as follows: I 5. Since the early part of the 18th I century, and possibly earlier still, an Arab ? acted by the fact that both before and after As regards (2) our contention is that xamily or small clan known as the Qawazim or / 1 Jowasimi have rulea over a large part of what I x -Luoir suujects ana trib called Jowasimi but the the ruling family only.the island of qishm, and other places on the Persian- coast. They were driven away during the ascendency of Karim Khan hand, who ruled over Persia from 1762. to_ 1779, but after his death they returned, and held Lingah and the surrounding district as an Arab principality until 1887. Towards the end of: this period the Persian Government asserted themselves to some extent upon the coast of the G-ulf and the Jowasimi Sheikhs of Lingah finally became in effect Persian vassals, whose succession to the Sheikhdom was habitually recognised by the Shah in the form of an appointment as Governor of Lingah, who paid to the Shah*s viceroy at Shiraz such tribute as the latter could extract from them, and who acknowledged themselves to be Persian subjects. In 1887 the Persian Government deposed the last Sheikh and took ovei the government of Lingah themselves. 7. Throughout the period under review, tnat is to say from a date earlier than 1747 to the present day, the islands of Tamb and Aou Musa, like the neighbouring Arab coast, have /beenbeen in the possession and effective occupation of the ruling jowasimi Sheikhs, the latter have always held them, however, in % accordance with Arab custom, on behalf of their clan as a whole, not as their purely personal property. For many years prior to 1887, the management, administration, and jurisdiction of the two islands was by common consent vested in the chief Jowasimi Sheikh of the Persian coast, that is, the Sheikh of Lingah, a near relative of the Sheikhs at Sharjah and Has-ul- khaimah. This administration was carried out on behalf of the family as a whole. After the extinction of the Lingah principality in 1887, the administration of Tamb was transferred from Lingah to Ras-ul-Khaimah, while Abu Musa was attached direct to Sharjah. This administrative division was maintained when Sharjah and Ras ul -khaimah were temporarily re-united in the present century and when they again became separate, with the result that Abu Musa now belongs to the Sheikh of Sharjah and Tamb to the Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah. /8.finally driven from Persia, any shadow of connexion between their rights and Persia went with them. For the rest, the Jowasimi have never acknowledged Persian sovereignty over tne islands, and documentary evidence of the rights has been produced to the Residency ir Agent on the Trucial Coast.9* A minor difference between Bahrain on the one hand, and Tamb and Abu Musa on the other, is that while Bahrain lies close to the Arabian shore, Tamb and Abu Musa are well out in the Gulf; Tamb is a good deal closer to the Persian than to the Arabian coast, Abu Musa is slightly nearer the Arabian. 10. The Persian claim to these islands was first asserted in 1887, the year in which the Jowasimis of Lingah were finally driven out of Persia; and has been re-asserted on five occasions between then and now. on the first of these occasions, in 1904, both Tamb and Abu Musa were temporarily occupied by the Persians, who, however, were induced, without the use of force, to withdraw after about a month. Less serious attempts to assert Persian sovereignty were made by Persian customs officials on threeuntil 1887 the history of the neighbouring island of Sirri was identical with that of lamb and Abu Musa. (Sirri, lihe Tamb, is rather nearer to Persia than to Arabia). It was the Persian seizure of Sirri in that year, and the establishment of a Persian customs post, which gave rise to the whole dispute. On wider political grounds His Majesty's Government acquiesced de facto in the Persian occupation, but they have never recognized it de jur e. in the draft Anglo-Persian general treaty (now virtually abandoned) it was proposed to perpetuate the existing de fact o position, Persia recognizing that Tamb and Abu Musa belonged to the Jowasimi Sheikhs of Oman while His Majesty's Government (on behalf of the Sheikh of Sharjah) recognized Sirri as Persian. The possibility of leasing Tamb to Persia was also examined in connexion with these negotiatfons, but it is unlikely that the Sheikh of has—ul-Ahaimah would lease the island on any terms acceptable to the Persian Government.IE. The Government of India maintain a llight-house on Tamb, which is otherwise of [little importance, having only some fifty inhabitants. The Sheihh of Ras-ul-Khaimah flies his flag there continuously. 13. A Memorandum dealing with the history of the two islands, which was communicated to Teymourtache in 1930, will be {found in B 5934/5773/S4 (1930) (print; Persia Part AXIX No. 160) and a note on the population etc. of the island by the political Resident in ... the Persian Gulf, in S 1343/280/91 (1931): (Print Persia Part XXX No. 47).

It seems a pity that the Minister should have felt bound to send in a memorandum of this nature. We are in possession of Tamb and Abu Musa, and it is for the Persians to prove their claim to those islands. A lengthy statement of the character now submitted will not only furnish them with material for a reply which they will not be slow to turn to their advantage, but cannot fail to strengthen the impression which must already exist that the real anxiety to reach a conclusion of the present negotiations is oi)6ur side, and not on thatof the Persians. The memorandum^ which appears largely to he based on the India Office memorandum in P.G.13, is, generally speaking, accurate, though it would perhaps have been better if we had said nothing in the second paragraph about the existing obscurity as to the position of the islands in the period prior to the middle ot the 18th century. The Persians will not be slow to retort that during the period in question Tamb, Abu Musa and Sirri were under their control, and to endeavour to shift the burden of disproof on to us. J.G.

Enclosure 2 in No. 161. Sir R. Clive to M. Feroughi. (Personal.) My dear Minister, Tehran, October 21, 1930. IN the course of a conversation we had on the 9th October at the Egyptian Legation your Highness told me confidentially that you very much hoped to attend the winter session of the League of Fations at Geneva and to visit the Persian Exhibition in London. In case you were able to come to London, you hoped to see Mr. Henderson with a view to coming to an agreement on certain important outstanding points connected with our negotiations for a general treaty. You assured me again on that occasion that the Persian Government were most anxious to conclude this treaty, in order to place Anglo-Persian relations on a new basis of friendship and confidence. 1 informed Mr. Henderson, confidentially, of what your Highness had said, and 1 now beg leave to inform you of his reply. Mr. Henderson would welcome the opportunity of seeing your Highness in London, but, while taking note that the Persian Government still profess a strong desire for a treaty settlement, he cannot help feeling that it largely depends on the attitude of the Persian Government whether any useful purpose would be served by entering upon a discussion of the treaty position in London. He goes on to say that no British Government can agree to hand over to the Persian Government territory belonging to Arab rulers under British protection against their wishes. In this connexion 1 would beg your Llighness to study the attached memorandum on the past history of the three islands of Sirri, Tamb and Bu Musa. Again, he points out that in the question of double income tax the Persian Government have raised a new issue which has no connexion with the treaty under negotiation. [5091] • P 2212 an With regard to the visits of His Majesty’s ships to Persian ports, the Persia Government appear to have gone back on their previous attitude, while in the proposed Henjam lease a number of unacceptable conditions and restrictions have been introduced. All that His Majesty’s Government ask for m Henjarn is the lease for a term of years and at a reasonable rental of a amall part of the island, including the wireless station, with recreational and storage facilities for liis Majesty s ships a)' without the imposition of irritating restrictions or the establishment of a military force and a needlessly large force of police, with all the attendant possibilities of friction and petty incidents. , , , . , , . , His Majesty’s Government consider tliat tney have, indeed, given ample proof of their friendly and conciliatory spirit in these negotiations. To their great regret, they cannot see that the Persian Government have really endeavoured to meet them half way. Even if the recent anti-British press campaign about Bahrein was not officially inspired, it is felt that the Persian Government had all the means at their disposal to check it, if they wished our negotiations to proceed in that essential atmosphere o( goodwill. . i nr rr i Your Highness will not, I trust, conclude from the foregoing that Mr. Henderson declines to discuss the treaty if you come to London. My object in writing is tomah it clear to your Higbness tbat tbe suspension of our negotiations cannot, in the opinion of my Government, in any way be ascribed to an intransigent oi unreasonable attitude on their part. On the contrary, my Government cannot avoid feeling that after two years of negotiations, in spite of the very considerable concessions they have expressed their willingness to make, the Persian Government have hardly taken these negotiations in the same spirit of goodwill and with the same real anxiety to succeed as they have themselves. If that is so, further discussion in London would be of little avail. If that is not so—and I still have confidence in your Highness’s expressed desire to place our relations on a new basis of friendly and sympathetic understanding- I beg that you will endeavour to give some tangible proof of the desire of the Persian Government to meet us, which would justify a resumption of negotiations in London. Lor instance, a settlement of tbe Henjam lease, entirely free from onerous restrictions aud conditions, would go far to convince my Government of the genuine desire of the Persian Government to come to an early and lasting settlement. In conclusion, I need hardly add that, as our negotiations are not broken off but only temporarily suspended, my Government confidently counts on tbe maintenance of the present status quo, and I should much appreciate an acknowledgment from your Highness giving this assurance. R. H. CLIVE. Enclosure 3 in No. 161. Aide-memoire.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA. CONPIDENTIAL. O V-*' September 28, 1934. Section 1. [E 6205/3283/91] Sir John Simon to Sir R. Hoare {Tehran). ^ Foreign Office, September 28, 1934. ’ X ASKED the Persian Minister to call to see me this morning and recalled a conversation I had had with M. Kazemi at Geneva on the 12th September, when the latter suggested a resumption of Anglo-Persian negotiations wit a vlew to improving relations between us and removing all points ot dispute, i expressed my pleasure at having heard this from the Persian Foreign Minister and said that I would in the ordinary course have awaited a further communi cation from Persia. But on returning to London I had been disquieted to learn that almost simultaneously with the Geneva conversation a Persian warship had paid another visit to the Island of Tamb without notification through the diplo matic channel. I reminded M. Ala that the P ersl ^ ^ His Maiesty’s Government regarded as quite unfounded, had hitherto been one of the matters to be settled by treaty. Tamb had for many generations been m the effective and peaceful occupation of its Arab ruler, for whose foreign relatio s His Maiesty’s Government are responsible. Yet there had been several cas 6s in which Persian warships had, without prior notification paid visits to the island during the past fifteen months, e.g., in July 1 ^ 3 , when the Government of India’s lighthouse was officially inspected; m April 1934; on the 28th August, 1934 when an Arab dhow was searched in territorial waters, and on tie 11th’September, 1934, when I was informed that the Persian commanding had landed, interrogated the inhabitants and had told British naval officers that he regarded Tamb as Persian territory. In view of the occupation of the island bv the Arab ruler, these naval visits without prior notification and these attempts to exercise mrisdiction could only be regarded as an attempt to jump a claim to the island, and we could not acquiesce in any such procedure. The visits could only mean one of two things—either the Persian Government wished to myent a fictitious value for their claim in future negotiations, or else they were unwidmg to make use of the peaceful and legal methods by which it is open to them to make their claim, if they think there is anything m it, and were attempting to achieve their object in a manner quite incompatible with their position as signatories of the Covenant and of the Kellogg Pact. His Majesty s Governmen , I said could not possibly acquiesce in such a situation and felt compelled to make it plain that the total cessation of such tactics is the essential preliminary to the resumption of negotiations. It was our earnest hope that the Persian Government would recognise the justice of this view and, if they do, m tact, desire to resume negotiations, would avoid such action as made resump ion impossible we ^, 0 n to tell the Minister that, in view of these incidents, His Maiestv’s Government had found it necessary to frame instructions to British naval officers in the Gulf as to their course of action m the event of further visits^ I read to M. Ala textually paragraphs 1 and 2 of my telegram to you Tso 93 of the 26th September. His Majesty’s Government had at first intended that these instructions to the British navy should be communicated to tin' Persian Government by yourself in a formal note. In view of the tenor of the conversa tion I had had at Geneva, His Majesty’s Government had decided not to send a formal note, but instead to instruct Sir R. Hoare to deliver a note on the lines of what I had said above (see my telegrams to you Nos. 92 and 93). I felt however that it would hardly be fair or friendly to the Persian Government not to inform them of the new instructions to our ships, as ignorance of these might unwittingly provoke a serious incident, and m any case we could not enter upon negotiations with the risk of these incidents being repeated. You, therefore had been told to read to the Persian Prime Minister the instructions which had been sent to British ships, explaining that, but for the Geneva conversation, they [215 ee—1]would have been communicated officially and that we should communicate them officially if further unnotified visits to Tamb or Abu Musa took place at any time. His Majesty’s Government were most anxious not to have to send in such a note, and I trusted that the question of Tamb visits would not arise again. It was our sincere desire to promote friendly relations with Persia'- and the v communication I had made was made with that object. 3. M. Ala listened attentively to what I said and subsequently saw Mr. Rendel in order to make sure of the details. He expressed the strong hope that it would be with him that we might hereafter settle our differences with Persia and undertook to report what I had said to his Government. I am, &amp;c. JOHN SIMON.

I cannot help feeling that it is unfortunate the Minister at Tehran, should have suggested to Persian Government this method ©f sending their ships to Tanb and Abu Musa. Our present warning combined with need for notification(which they would probably have been unwilling to give, ae it would have admitted Amu sovereignty! might well have kept them away which is what is wanted. If Persian Government adopt Minister's suggestion, it win be difficult to stop Persian ships going to these Islands quite frequently and Arab opinion will not understand it.

The note concludes by intimating that 'mention of the Islana of sirri shoulu not be regarded as constituting an aumission of the Persian claim to de .lure sovereignty* It is merely a recognition of the de facto occupation by her customs officials, whose foreknowledge of the proposed visit is desirable in order to preclude the possibility of any misunderstanding tt . a. The position as regards visits by Persian ships to Ar^-b ports or islands is that tne Persian Government have been officially warned that the Arab rulers will require prior notification, but will not insist on a request for permission. 3.

Please see the F.O. telegrams Nos. 91-95 below, which were despatched on 26th September following the Cabinet approval of the interdepartmental proposals. It is understood that Sir J. Simon spoke to the Persian Minister in London on 27th September in the sense ^of telegrams Nos. 91 and 92, and read to him the communication embodied in No. 93,and that l. Ala stated that he would report the conversation to the Persian M.F.if daring the latter s visit to London. M. Ala also suggested to Hr. Rendel that the situation could only be redressed by the early conclusion of a general treaty settlement. The Persians do not seem to be very much perturbed by the action taken, and one cannot help wondering whether the F.h. lear of an explosion (see para. 2 of telegram ho. to) and their/their tenderness for Persian susceptibilities may not have been misplaced. It will be remembered that the F.O. were apprehensive as to the effect of a afite m the sense of telegram No. 93 at the moment when Kazemi had approached us on the question of reopening treaty discussions; anfi it was owing to this apprehension that it was decided to make the communication embodied in that telegram oral and not written. On the other hand, there was, as was pointed out to the F.O. at the meeting on 19th September, the opposite risk that, in the absence of a written note, the Shah might not become informed of the fullforce ot H.M.O.'s views, and of the orders on which R.K.'s ships will act in the event of further incidents similar to the recent Tamb incidents; -if the Shah is not adequately informed by his Ministers of the language which we have used, it is possible that adequate instructions may not be given to the commander of the Persian navy to avoid anj misunderstanding or incident (para. 3 of telegram no. 93). The F.O., however, were quite sure that the action proposed would be quite strong enough for this purpose, and it is to be hoped that it twill prove so. In any case, it should be noted that the new instructions to the C. in C. covered by telegram No. 93 are being put into effect immediately (see end of telegram No. 95, and the Admiralty telegram ^o the C. in C. No. 2120/2^), i.e. , if there is a farther incident at Tamb or Aba Llasa, the C. in C. will act at once on the instractions now given; in other words, tne Persians will not be given another period of grace while a written note is pat in in the sense of telegrain No. 93, but the note be sent in merely to pat on record the[inute Paper.

Ala to link the situation with the question of concluding a general treaty settlement may be significant. There have been some indications that the Persians desire to resume negotiations not on the basis on which they were left off, but on a new basis, more favourable to themselves in regard to the question of the Arab sovereignty of the islands. It is possible that they are prepared to create, or at any rate to use, such incidents as a form of squeeze.

I was, however, disquieted to learn on returning to London that almost simaltsniottsly with oar conversation a Persian warship had paid yet a farther visit to famb, without prior notification, ^nd had landed a party on the island. This visit, following on previous incidents, inelaaing the search in the territorial waters of the island of an Arab dhow by ths Imperial warship Palang on 28th August, can only mean one of two things. hither the Persian dovornraent wish xo invent a fictitious value for their claim in future negotiations: or else they are unwilling to make ase of the peaceful and legal methods by which it Is open to them to pursue it and are determined to achieve their object in a maimer quite incompatible with their position as signatories of Covenant of of Bat ions and Kellogg Pact.

It is their earnest hope that Persian tfoverame nt will recognise ((JJ OUT 26.0.34.2 this country. It had been thought, therefore, better somewhat to revise the procedure end it was now agreed between the Departments that our Minister at Tehran should read to the Persian Prime Minister the draft note, informing him that this note would have been delivered at once if it had not been for recent Persian expressions of a great desire to reach agreement on all points, but that conversations cannot be undertaken if this sort of thin^r goes on. Sir R. Hoare would then warn the Persian Government that, should such an event recur, instructions would be issued and a note sent in. A similar communication will be made to the Persian Minister in London.

The S.N.O. informed Bayendor, the Commander of the Persian Navy, that Tamb belongs to the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah. On 13 September the S.h,0.reported that the Persian vessel CHAHROKH 1 was at Tamb, that the Commander stated that he considered Tamb to be Persian and that he was carrying out tfee programme in accordance with Bayendor ! s directions and would remain at Tamb until he received further orders. The ! CHAHRQKH 1 had sent a landing party on shore which had questioned the caretaker and asked him to go on board the vessel. It seems probable that these activities are deliberately intended as assertions of Persian sovereignty The matter was considered at meetings of the F.O. on 14 and 17 September and draft telegrams Y^ere prepared (1) to the C.in C., East Indies, giving very careful instructions as to hov; he should deal with Persian acts of aggression of various kinds, stressing the importance of the avoidance of force if possible, but authorising force in the last resort to prevent Persia jumping a claim to the island or to protect Arab persons and property; (2) instructing H.M.Minister, Tehran, to address a note to the Persian Government Yearning them of the instructions which were being given. On 12 September the Persian M.F.A. at Geneva approached Sir John Simon on the subject of reopening the general treaty negotiations. In view of this demarche it was proposed at a further meeting of the F.O. on 19 September to tone down the instructions to Tehran; the new proposal is that the specific warning to/ 2621 6000 3 34to the Persian Government of the action -which we will take in the event of aggression should not he sent in as a written note hut should at this stage he communicated orally.

They propose that communications should be addressed simultaneously to M.

Persian Government have been informed that Arab rulers require prior notification but not permission fbr visits, and you will no doubt receive information from Political Resident of any such notifications. In the absence of notification C.O. of sloop should not refuse to exchange usual visits of courtesy with Persian Commanding Officer, but should take a suitable opportunity of informally expressing surprise at his presence without notification, and reminding him of the status of the territory in question. Immediate report should be sent to Political Resident and to Admiralty. If Persian warship ronains peacefully in Arab territorial waters after this intimation no action should be taker to order or force the ship to leave, but full facts should be reported. It...It is of great importance to avoid any action which would suggest that prior permission is required, or that the right of innocent passage through territorial waters Is not recognised. Such action might react to our disadvantage elsewhere in Gulf. Right of innocent passage does not include right to anchor except in stress of weather.FILE COPY f T~: rrr \ (E10 gioupe) 4930.

At the time of the 1928 incident no instructions were in the end issued authorising the use of force to protect shipping, but later that year ^ w M* instructions were issued that the occupation by Persia of jh/^4 t, ^ t tu. &lt; ~~ J - ?c~Ln. 2621 6000 3/34 Tamb and Abu Musa was to be prevented, even by force as a last resort. It is desirable that, in oruer that ..aval officers may know where they stand, comprehensive ^ instructions should now' be issued in regara oo axi aggressive acts of a kind that infringe Arab sovereignty, whether on shore or against shipping in territorial waters. In the light of the discussion, the F.O. representatives agreed that there was a strong case for authorising the use of force in the last resort m all such cases, and for warning the Persian Govt, beforehand that our Naval officers are being instructive accordingly* ttrUU' . . , . The attached draft telegrams (with tne L exception of para. 2 of the first telegram) were prepared, as a result of the meeting, for submission to the Ministers concerned. An explanatory memo., of which a copy is attached, was also prepared by Mr. Rendel for submission to Sir John Simon. 7/hen the papers were submitted to Sir R. Vansittart on Saturday evening, he discussed the case2621 6000 3/34 Minute Paper. Department. -he F.O. are submitting the draft telegrams to Sir John Simon. hr. Rendel stated, however, at the meeting that the Persian M.F.A. , who has come to Geneva, has given some indication that he maid like to explore with Sir John Simon the possibility of resuming the general treaty negotiations. As the Persian Govt, have made such advances before, and they have come to nothing, it is doubtful whether much importance should be attached to this move. ic But Mr. Rendel thinks that in view of tOTS, Sir John Simon may be reluctant to issue the proposed instructions to Tehran at the present moment, and that possibly he might prefer, in his conversation with the Persian M.F.A., to make the Tamb incident a test of the sincerity of any professions that may be put forward of the Persian Govt.’s desire to resume negotiations; i.e., he might ask how such resumption is possible when the Persian Navy is behaving in this manner, and seek by this means to secure a cessation of its improper activities. This, however, is largely conjectural, and it is submitted that the draft telegrams might be approved, subject to their approval by the S. of S. for F.A. and the First Lord of the Admiralty. ''7 h.5781/3285/91) b ^ !&lt;U~ k^n-\ T A M B . An urgent decision is required as to the instructions to he sent to the British Naval authorities in the Persian Gull in consequence of two new incidents which have recently occurred at the island of Tamb. 2. The islands of Tamb and Abu Musa (see attached sketch map) have belonged to the Arab Rulers of the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf since the 18th century, but Persia has long claimed sovereignty over them, in the same way as she claimed sovereignty over Bahrein, although if possible with even less justification. It was proposed that Persia should abandon her claims to these islands as part of the proposed general Anglo-Persian Treaty settlement; and as it was informally agreed with the Persian Government early in the negotiations that the so-called 'status quo' should be main tained in the Gulf pending the conclusion of a general treaty; we have long regarded the Persians as committed not to attempt to 'jump a claim' to these islands or do anything to prejudge their fate, while the treaty was in negotiation. Certain incidents, however, having occurred which suggested that the Persians might not observe this commitment and might try to acquire the islands in advance of a settlement, the Cabinet decided in November 1928 to endorse the recommendation of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee to the effect that 'the Admiralty should instruct the naval authorities that the status quo is to be maintained in the Gulf and that they are to prevent ( even by force in the last resort ) the occupation by Persia of Tamb and Abu Musa.' The following telegram was accordinglyaccordingly sent by the Admiralty to the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, on November 15th, 19^8: ’’The following instruction is issued as a pre caution and not as a result of any recent occurrences of which you are not aware. Occupation by Persia of Tamb and Abu Musa would be an infringement of the agreement that status quo is to be maintained in the Gulf pending decision of outstanding questions, and if necessity arises, is to be prevented even by force, as a last resort.' 5. This instruction has never been cancelled; but on June 11th, 1954, the Middle East Ministerial Sub-Committee of the C.I.D. decided, in connexion with the delicate situation which had developed owing to the desire of the Admiralty to continue to use Henjam and Basidu as long as possible, and in view of the undesirability of creating any incident which migh lead the Persians to demand the evacuation of those two places that 'no affirmative action should be taken at Tehran, but 'that our object should be to endeavour to maintain the status 'quo as long as possible.' i 4. Two fresh incidents have recently occurred at Tambo On August 28th the Persian sloop Palang searched an Arab Dhow (belonging to the Sheikhdom of Dibai) within the territorial waters of Tamb (see telegram No.225 from Commander-in-Chief, copy annexed, Annex I)&lt;&gt; On September 15th the Persian sloop Chanrokh landed a party at Tamb and interrogated the Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khoimah*s agent (see telegram No. 01002/12 from H.M.S. 'Shoreham' Annex II). It should be noted that an earlier incident had occurred at Tamb on April 26 th, when some Persian officials landed and interrogated the agent, while in the summer of 1955 a party landed from a Persian warship and inspected the light-house maintained there by the Government of| India3 India through the Basra Port authorities. 5. The Admiralty have now also received a telegram froa the Commander-in-Chief (No. 234 Annex III) showing that the Commander-in-Chief considers that the Persians are now definitely trying to jump a claim to jurisdictional rights at Tamb. 6 . It is important that the Persians should not be allowed to prejudge the position by actions of this kind, and if they can carry them out with impunity our position is likely rapidly to deteriorate. The Admiralty are therefore most anxious that an urgent decision should be reached reaffirming and applying to present conditions the Cabinet conclusion of 1928. 7. The position was considered at an interdepartmental meeting at the Foreign Office on September 14th, and it was agreed that the balance of argument lay in favour of vigorous action. This appears to be one of the comparatively rare cases where His Majesty’s Government are on strong legal ground and where the Persians, if they continue such actions, will put themselves definitely in the wrong. It was pointed out however that such a policy, involving as it does authority to use force in the last resort, might conceivably — although in a somewhat remote contingency - lead to a clash which might enable Persia to appeal to the League of Nations under Article 15 of the Covenant, and possibly even under the Optional Clause. (From the Foreign Office point of view this might of course be no bad thing as it might enable us to dispose of the Persian claims once and for all.) It was further pointed outout to the Admiralty representatives that a clash with the Persians might produce a situation leading to the immediate revival of the Persian demand for our evacuation of Henjam an&lt; Basidu. The Admiralty are, however, prepared to take this risk. On the other hand our legal position appears to be extremely strong, and if entirely illegitimate Persian action of this type were to be tolerated at places such as Tamb and against shipping belonging to our Arab proteges, we should be placed in a most humiliating position for not having been able to defend the legitimate interests of our proteges, which we are indeed committed to do under out treaties with them. It is one thing not to provoke Persia to retaliation by provoca tive action at such places as Henjam and Basidu, where our position is untenable; but it is quite another not to defend our rights and those of our clients in the case of an attempt on the part of Persia to peg out a claim to jurisdictional rights on Arab territory or in Arab territorial waters. 8 . The Admiralty are therefore most anxious to send instructions to the naval authorities as soon as possible, authorising them if necessary and in the last resort, to use force if, after due warning, such incidents recur. 9. The Persian Government were never warned of the instructions issued to the naval authorities in 19ii8, i.e. that force was to be used in the last resort to resist attempted Persian encroachment at Tamb and Abu Musa (see paragraph 2 above). It is now submitted therefore that, if the general line desired by the Admiralty is approved, the Persian Government ought to be formally warned of what is contemplated. This could be done simultaneously with any protest which is made to them in regard to the recent casescases of encroachment at Tamb. The attached draft telegram to Tehran and to the Commander-in-chief East Indies and Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf have accordingly been prepared to give effect to these suggestions. 10 . I submit that in all the circumstances the balance of argument is in favour in this particular instance of the course of action proposed, and that the telegrams should therefore be approved.

Persian Gulf while acting in accordance with instructions contained in Admiralty message 1845 1st August it is strongly urged that an early protest may be made to Tehran to prevent a recurrence. 1859 Z/7'4 iCs.

Such a state of affairs could only lead to increasing difficulty in maintaining Anglo- Persian relations on any sort of equal footing. At same time I realise that delivery of such a warning, while it may minimise danger of collision at Tamb, may equally lead to g eneral explosion, including a renewed demand for evacuation of Henjam and appeal to League over Bahrein, Tamb and Abu Musa.

In view of 2800 5000 5 34u.s.s., A meeting with representatives of the Admiralty and F.O. was held yesterday to consider the recent Tamb incidents. There are now two incidents:- (1) On 28th August the Persian gunboat ’Palan^ searched a Debai dhow in Tamb territorial waters; (2) the activities of the Persian vessel ’Chahrokh’, which has landed a party and is remaining off Tamb - see S.N.O.’s telegram of 13th September. It will be noted that though, at the time of incident (1), the S.N.O. informed Bayendor, Commander of the Persian Navy, that Tamb belonged to Ras-al- Khaimah, the commander of the ’Chahrokh’ now states that he considers Tamb Persian, and is carrying out a programme in accordance with Bayendor’s directions. There seems little doubt that the deliberate purpose of the Persian activities is to jump a claim to the island. The meeting yesterday settled the lines of a draft telegram to Tehran for submission to the Ministers concerned. The draft, which is now being put into shape and which it is hoped to submit to the S. of S. on Monday, will give instructions that the Persian/Persian Crovt. should be warned that we are giving orders resist by force in the last resort, any persistent action, such as improper activity by landing parties or search of shipping in territorial waters, v/hich connotes a claim to sovereignty. It is also suggested that detailed instructions should be sent to the 0. in C. how he should act, and that they should emphasise the desirability of avoiding force wherever possible. The drafts of the telegrams will, I think, be found satisfactory when they are submitted. It was pointed out in the discussion by the F.O. Legal Adviser that there is a risk that, in the event of our having to use force, Persia might be able to make such action on our part a peg on which to hang submission of the Tamb dispute to the International Court under the 'optional clause'(which Persia and this country have accepted, subject to respective reservations! A copy of Persia’s reservations is ^ . »&gt;v reaching character). H.L.G . 1 s reservations will be found &amp; in para. 8 of the attached White Paper, CnxL. 3452. The ^ to our Naval officers to regard as aggression, and to ar jiy keing obtained^ (my recollection is that they are of a far- * . words/words “with regard to situations or facts subsequent to ^ the said ratification” have always been held to guard us completely against compulsory jurisdiction o^ our disputes with Persia as to sovereignty in Bahrain, Tamb and Abu Musa. It is, however, possible that use of force by us in resisting Persian aggression at Tamb might be regarded as not covered by our reservation quoted, since the act of force, considered by itself, would be a new fact; on the other hand, we, of course, could point out that Persia was the original aggressor, and that the whole incident arose out of the sovereignty dispute, which was an anterior “situation”. It is also possible that if Persia 1 s reservations to her acceptance of the optional clause we&amp;e extensive enough, compulsory jurisdiction might be barred under our reciprocity reservation. Thirdly, if Persia gave notice of submission to theCourt, we could always claim to take 1 the matter first to the Council (under our final reservation), and hope by political influence to get a decision in our favour out of court. In any case, the risk, such as it is, seems clearly one which has to be taken, as we cannot acquiesce in cumulative acts of aggression at Tamb which/which might result in Persia jumping a claim. '' ?'rn 1 ik B. u.s.s ., Please see the farther telegrams below. It appears that another Persian vessel is at Tamb and landed a party, and that the commander stated that he considered Tamb to be Persian. The Admiralty message of 1928 which is referred to was an instruction that the ’’occupation b^ Persia of Tamb' should, if necessary, be prevented even by force as a last resort. In the case of Persians landing and acting improperly on shore, the Navy deal fairly easily with the situation by landing a party to escort them back to their vessel. It is possible that the Persians are pursuing a definite plan to put the onus of the dispute on us, in the way which the G. in C. suggests in his telegram, No. 234. It will help to defeat any such object if we inform the Persian dovt. (if this has not already been done) that the Arab Sheikhs require notification of visits to Tamb and Abu Lusa. It seems desirable that fresh comprehensive instructions to cover the various contingencies - interference with dhows, armed landing, etc. - should be issued to the S.'. 0 ., and that when it has been decided what/what the instructions should be, we should warn the Persian Govt, of our intentions. The word 'piracy' is not appropriate to acts committed in territorial waters, as it annears that it means an offence on the high seas. in the sense that interference with shipping m Arab territorial waters would be regarded as an act of aggression, and resisted accordingly. The F.O., however, will certainly be very averse to further instructions to use force, and may decline to agree without a Cabinet ruling. Mr. Seal and I (with Col. Fowle, if he is available) are discussing the case with Mr. Rendel in a preliminary way this afternoon.6lpCCB Jp I • IP ''' 4* - W'l L.P.—No. 8 Any further comm uni cat ior should be addressed to— The Secretary of the Admiralty, Loi^on, S.W.l quoting “ Admiralty, S.W.l. r&gt; J- - I3thr September /^j4 PQr-y 1 t-.f vj / O X i;. i The Secretary of the Admiralty presents his compliments to The Under Secretary of State, India Office, and begs to transmit herewith copy of the undermentioned paper» For whom From XXX Cm inC. hast Indies, S.N.O.

Mr. beai consulted me by telephone before drafting this telegram. The suggested instructions seem suitable, if the F.O. concur in them, and if you approve, 1 would propose to inform him accordingly. As regards the 1928 case referred to as a precedent, on that occasion the F.O. at first suggested that naval officers m the Gulf should be authorised, if they found Persian custom launches lying off Tamb or Abu Musa, to order them to leave the neighbourhood v/ithout delay (F.O. letter to Admiralty of 16th August, 1928 - P. 4415/28). The Admiralty thereupon suggested that if such orders were disobeyed, the Persian vessel should be given a time limit to withdraw, under threat of opening fire, and that if she still disobeyed, we should ’’open fire at first over or short of her, and finally, if necessary, to hit' (Admiralty/(Admiralty letter to F.O. of 17th Aagast, 1928). The F.O., however, were unwilling to agree to these suggestions, and consequently withdrew their original suggestion (F.O. letter to Admiralty of 24th August, 1928). At the same time, the F.O. were prepared to inform the Persian Govt., if our Charge d f Affaires saw no objection, that any action against Arab dhows outside Persian waters or in the neighbourhood of i amb and adu Musa would be regarded as an act of piracy (g.O. letter of 24th August, 1928 - P. 4585/28). jiuf9 Draft Paper.

(The general 1.0. view was expressed in Laithwaite’s letter of 2nd August, P.Z. 4599/34,) Since it appears that the ’Palang’ searched an Arab dhow in Arab territorial waters, we are inclined to think that this is a case in which firm representations should be made at Tehran, and that they should take the form not merely of an empty protest (of which we have made so many), but should indicate to the Persian Govt, that we are prepared, if necessary, to use forcible measures to prevent illegal acts in the territorial waters of Arab Sheikhs in special treaty relations with/[ r K' with H.M.G., and that we intend to give orders to oar Naval officers accordingly* In the F.O. official letter of 24th August, 1928, E 4112/421/91, it was stated that Lord Cushendun would be prepared M to authorise H»I . Charge d’Affaires at Tehran to inform the Persiaiji Govt., if he sees no objection, that any action against Arab trading dhows by their customs boats outside Persian waters, or in the neighbourhood of Tamb and Abu Musa, will be regarded as an act of piracy; and to advise the Persian Govt, in consequence to issue immediate instructions to their customs boats not to interfere with Arab trading vessels in the neighbourhood of Tamb and Abu Lusa or outside Persian territorial waters'. Would the F.O. agree to inform the Persian Govt, now that in future interference by Persian warships with shipping in the territorial waters of the Arab Sheikhs in special treaty relations with H.M.G. woutd be regarded.as an act of piracy^and treated as such, and that our Naval officers will be instructed c accordingly; and to advise the Persian Govt, in consequence to issue immediate * not instructions to their Navy/to interfere r I ^Draft Paper.

In event of further encoimters with Persian gu - boats in territorial waters of Tomb or ^bu Musa, or of any other territory of ^rab rulers in sp 4 cia.i Treaty relationship with H.M.

Persian Government have been informed that jiTae rulers require prior notification but not permission for visits, and you will no doubt receive information from Political Resident of any such notifications. la V, the absence of notification C.O. of sloop should not refuse to exchange usual visits of courtsay with Persian Commanding Officer, but should take a suitabli opportunity of informlly expressing surprise at his presence without notification, and reminding him of tho status of the territory in question.

Right of innocent passage does not include right to anchor except in stress of weather. Should Persian warship be met interfering with shipping of any nationality in -.rah territorial waters, immediate steps should be taken to warn Persian Commanding Officer that he is infringing the sovereignty of the urab ruler, and that H.M. Government will take a very serious view of this breach of international law. In the most unlikely event of this warning being disregarded he should be warned that the British ship has instructions to use force to prevent any such infringement, and given a time limit to clear off.

Iphowed the Bushire telegram of 6 th September at P.Z. 5741/34 to Colonel Fowle when he called last week He was in favour of awaiting further information, but prina facie was inclined to suggest that this was a case on which we should make representations at Tehran.

We should step carefully in regard to Basidu and henjam, but this does not^mean that we should refrain fiomadopting a firm attitude, m regard especially to other matters. The despatch from Tehran of 16th June at P.Z. 4599 reported that an official of the Persian Ministry for F.A. had stated 'that it had been decided in principle that notes regarding questions concerning the Arab Sheikhdoms should not be replied to in writing'.

It will be recalled that when the Persian warship t, Palang u visited Tamb in July, 1933, His Majesty’s Charge d f Affaires at Tehran addressed to the Persian G-overnment a protest (a copy of which was enclosed in Foreign Office letter No. E 5348/5062/34 of the 17th October) setting forth clearly the views of His Majesty’s Government regarding the inadmissibility of the Persian claim to the island and the impropriety of the visit in view of the status quo understanding. The views of His Majesty’s Government are, moreover, on record in a variety of other documents which could be quoted if any attempt v/ere made to show that they had tacitly acquiesced in the Persian claim. 3. Sir John Simon is a dvised that in these circumstances it would not be possible for the Persian Government in the event The Under-Secretary of State, India Office. 27 5 JUU1934 IN Lm A iC£ IA O X? vHBI event of the dispute regarding the ov/nership of Tamb being referred to an arbitral tribunal, to make capital out of the fact that no protest had been made against the visit to the island by Persian officials, referred to in Sir Reginald Hoare T s despatch - the nature of this visit being in any case equivocal. The present policy of His Majesty’s Government involves the avoidance of anything in the nature of a needless challenge to Persia, especially in matters connected with the Persian Gulf. In these circumstances, Sir John Simon proposes, subject to the concurrence of Sir Samuel Hoare, to instruct His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran to take no action in the matter. 4. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Admiralty.

No particular harm appears likely to be caused by these visits but if they become a routine matter and are allowed to pass without protest the Persi m Government may ultimately construe our inaction as implying some form of acquiescence in their claims, which might be usefully quoted before m international tribunal.

There seem to have been two recent visits (though this is not quite clear), one about March, perhaps by Persian Customs officials, and a second on 26th April by the Persian Governor, the Collector of Customs and the Chief of Police at Bunder Abbas. Further information may be forthcoming about these incidents, but they do not seem to be of much importance or to give sufficient ground for an official protest to the Persian Government, especially in view of the present state of our relations with Persia. The Persians did not attempt to visit the lighthouse on Tamb Island. It will be remembered that we protested officially at Tehran against the visit of a Persian/ l HiPersian warship to the island in July last and the inspection of the lighthouse by Persian officials. On that occasion we received a most unsatisfactory reply to our representations (P.Z. 7538/33). l A- ct* O^x i*r&lt;- La^ (r^CCO^ Ui-Lfofy II m POiJTiGAu COivih/|iTT&amp;&amp;» 12 m 1954 vVCONFIDENTIAL. 11 Jt/N»J 4 ^°-C/Z30 of 1934.

The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, H.M. S. SHORE HAM. (Sgd.) John Harding. Commander in Command. REPORTED PERSIAN YISIT TO TUMB ISLAND. Submitted, In view of the report I received when at SHARJAH that Persian Off iceis or off icials had recently visited THMB Island (Enclosure No.l to LUPIN 1 s No.13/676 dated 16th April, 1934), I called at Tumb on 25th April when proceeding from BAHREIN to BASIDU, and interviewed MAHMOOD, the Shaikh of RAS AL KHAIMAH'S representative who had returned three days previously. Prom my conversation with him it was clear that the incident referred to occurred when Persian Officers visited TUMB Island and inspected the lighthouse some six months ago. MAHMOOD 1 s visit to RAS AL KHAIMAH about 3 weeks ago was the first he had made since the Persian Officers landed and this appears to account for his verbal report to the Shaikh having given the affair the appearance as of recent occurrence. He informed me that no Persian ships or officials had in fact visited the island in the interim.PERSIAN ACTIVITIES AT TUMB. PcTl The Residency Agent who has 'been spending the last three weeks at Has A1 Khaimah and returned to Sharjah yesterday (15th Apnl), informs me that three days ago the Shaikh of Has A1 Khaimah , s representative at Tumb Island (Mahmood), arrived and made the following report to the Shaikh. 2. About 3 weeks ago a Persian Gunboat anchored off Tumb, An officer landed and approached Mahmood, whose family is, I understand, of Persian extraction, and said that he, Mahmood, being a Persian should help the Persians. He asked Mahmood what his duties were and by whom he was paid. He then suggested that if Mahmood would hoist the Persian instead of the Trucial coast flag he would pay Mahmood double the salary. To which Mahmood replied that he was the servant of the Shaikh of Has A1 Khaimah, as his father had been before him, and he couldn’t do so. The Persian Officer then appears to have made a veiled threat by saying to Mahmood that people sometime mysteriously disappeared. Mahmood is at present at Ras A1 Khaimah and afraid to return to Tumb. Isa tells me that he is making a report to the Political Resident by the next mail. 3. When I visited Tumb yesterday, my interpreter asked Mahmood’s brother whom he met whilst on shore, whether any ships, and he mentioned Persian ships, had visited Tumb lately. Mahmood’s brother replied that they had not; which conflicts with the infomation given in paragraph 2 above. But I was of course yesterday not in possession of the information given in paragraph 2 and so took no steps to verify it. IArticle VIII. — Tamb, Abu Musa, Sirri.

Bailing' ceitain amendments of wording which do not affect the sense, and the omission dealt with in paragraph 6 below, this is the original British draft The latter is given in the annex, as it has so long held the field. It has never been discussed in detail from the drafting point of view, since until the treaty negotiations broke down in the summer of 1930 the Persians steadfastly refused to consider even provisionally the abandonment of their claim to Tamb and Abu Musa. 2. As regards Abu Musa, Teymourtache in October 1930 offered to abandon the Persian claim if Persia were given Tamb. Sir R. Clive refused to discuss this suggestion, as the Sheikh of Ras-el-Khaimah (the owner of Tamb, but not of Abu Musa), refused to part with his island at any price, and His Majesty’s Government could not surrender to Persia what was not theirs. 3. At a later stage Teymourtache said that his Government might be content with a long lease of Tamb, the Sheikh keeping his garden on the island [subsequent investigation showed that there was no garden] and enjoying exemption from customs dues [the Sheikh, however, never resides on the island]. He suggested a fifty-year lease, the Sheikh to be paid whatever His Majesty’s Government paid for the lease of Henjam. Eventually, as a result of this suggestion, the Sheikh was approached in the spring of 1931, and furnished the Residency Agent with a statement of the terms on which he would be willing to lease his island (see Annex II). The terms, it will be seen, are unlikely to appeal to the Persians. The Admiralty suggested certain alterations which would render the terms slightly more palatable while not weakening their practical effect, but the matter was not pursued further. The Sheikh stated, however, in September 1933 that he had received c ‘ from Tehran ” a letter concerning the lease of Tamb by the Persian Government. Whether there is any truth in this is not yet known; he stated that he had not answered the letter. 4. If it ever becomes possible to reach a solution on these lines, special provision will have to be made for exempting the lighthouse staff from Persian customs dues both on their personal effects and on official stores, and from the necessity of obtaining visas (the nearest Persian consuls are at Basra and Karachi) when arriving at or leaving the island. 5. It is not certain whether, in putting forward the offer referred to in paragraph 3 above, Teymourtache did or did not throw into the bargain the abandonment of the Persian claim to Abu Musa. Probably he did not (two accounts by Sir R. Clive are conflicting in this respect), but in any case, as Teymourtache is no longer in power, and his offer was an oral one, the whole question would have to be taken up again from the beginning. 6. The reference to Henjam in line 7 of the original British draft (see Annex I) must have been due to some misunderstanding, as, of course, there has never been any dispute regarding the sovereignty of Persia over that island.

[Article IX ] Article IX: Lighting and Buoying in the Persian Gulf. This was removed at an early stage and by common consent from the scope of the general treaty, and the question will, it is hoped, be dealt with m the proposed Tripartite Convention relating to the Shatt el- Arab. 2. The India Office have, however, recently suggested that an attempt might be made to secure the reinsertion of a brief treaty article, to the effect that e High Contracting Parties will deal with the question of lighting and buoying by means of a separate agreement. This, they suggest, might make it easier to reach agreement later with regard to the Shatt el- Arab Conservancy Board proiect; alternatively, if this project failed, or if His Majesty’s Government were for any reason to decide to let it drop, such an article might still make it easier to press the Persian Government, at a later stage, to agree to the co-ordination of lighting and buoying arrangements in the Persian Gulf. 3. In view of certain recent indications that the Persian Government intend to go their own way in the matter of lighting and buoying, and that they regard the Conservancy Board project as inadequate, it may well prove impossible to secure the insertion of such a treaty article at this stage; but there seems no harm in making the attempt provided that the question is not allowed to stand in the way of an otherwise satisfactory settlement. The article might run as follows “ Les Hautes Parties Contractantes s’entendront, dans un accord special a survenir apres la conclusion du present traite, sur la question des phares et bouees dans le golfe Persique et dans les eaux avoisinantes.” (Version 1.)

(No. 498.) 7 ^ r ’ wt'ptj p , Tehran, October 27, W11H reference to my telegram No. 274 of the 22nd October, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of the note that I have received rnJv 6 ^ n J; stei “ for Foreign Affairs, on the subject of the visit paid to the !g house at Tamb on the 23rd July by officers from the Persian warship Palana, u 4 - i ^ he argument used in the third paragraph is logical to a certain extent, but only on the assumption that the oral engagement undertaken by the Persian Government not to disturb the status quo cannot apply to the Island of Tamb. the reason given m the fifth paragraph for excluding the island from the scope ot this agreement, that “ Persian officials have always gone there,” has no basis ot tact ot which I am aware, apart from the incident of August 1928 (see annual report for 1928, paragraphs 147 to 155). 3. The refusal to admit a comparison with the Island of Sirri has no rational basis, inasmuch as His Majesty’s Goverment equally claim that Tamb is the property of the Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah, both de facto and de jure. The quotation from the Legation notes of the last three years regarding the visits ot H.M.S. Ormonde to Sirri is not quite correct. What was said in each case was that mention was made of the proposed visit because the island was in the de facto occupation of Persian customs officials. 4. The reply to the charge of discourtesy takes no note of the fact that all the visits to lights on the Persian coast took place before any reply had been received from His Majesty’s Government to the request for assistance and guidance. 5. Unless previous developments have rendered any further communication to the Persian Government regarding the status of Tamb superfluous by the time this despatch has been considered, I suggest that I should reply reiterating the view of His Majesty’s Government that Tamb is de facto and de jure the property of the Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah; that at the time of the incident the Persian Government, whatever their own views as to the status of the island might be, were bound by a “gentleman’s agreement,” which they had not until then repudiated, not to take any steps to alter the status quo at places like Tamb; that the Persian contention that there has been no violation of this agreement because the island is regarded as Persian territory de facto is palpably absurd, and that it was out of respect for this agreement that His Majesty’s Government did not at any time during the last three years send H.M.S. Ormonde to Sirri without notice, notwithstanding the fact that they consider it to be de jure the property of the Jowasimi Sheikhs of Sharjah and Ras-ul-Khaimah. 6. I have dealt in a separate despatch with the question of the status quo agreement. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 181). I have, &amp;c. V. A. L. MALLET. Enclosure in No. 1. Persiaii Minister for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires. (Translation.) M. le Charge d’Affaires, October 21, 1933. ONE of the questions alluded to in your esteemed note of the 1st Mehr (the 23rd September, 1933), which I promised in my note of the 16th Mehr (the 8th October, 1933) to reply, was the inspection of the lighthouse on the Island [971 x—11]pposm of Tamb carried out by the officials of the Imperial Government, which had formed the subject of your note of the 31st Murdad (the 22nd August, 1933). 2. In your note of the 31st Murdad (the 22nd August, 1933) you have alluded to and made protests in respect of two points, namely, one m lespect of the visit of the ship Palang to the Island of Tamb, and the other m respect of the fact that you considered the visit and the inspection of the lighthouse 17- question to be at any rate discourteous. . 3. In respect of the first point, taking into consideration the mtormation which you have as to the views and statements of and the proofs (adduced by) the Imperial Government regarding the ownership of the said island, no objection can be taken to the visit of the Palang to that place, since at a time when the officials of the Imperial Government were engaged in inspecting all the light houses on the Persian coasts, they could not rightly abstain from inspecting the lighthouse on the Island of Tamb, which they consider their indisputable property and an integral part of their territory. 4. The question of the visit of the survey ship Ormonde to the Island of Sirri, which you quote as an example, cannot be compared with this case, since the Persian Government consider the Island of Tamb de jure and de facto to be their property. 5. With regard to the Island of Sirri, which, as your esteemed note makes clear, the British Government recognise to be Persian territory de facto, but in regard to which they consider the de jure rights of Persia open to question, I find it my duty to inform you that my Government have always considered, and still consider, this island as their property de jure and de facto. 6. As regards the observance of the status quo in the Persian Gulf, the interpretation which you propound in this connexion is not agreed to by the Persian Government, nor does it apply to this case, since the officials of the Persian Government have always gone there and have always considered, and still consider, the said island as Persian territory de facto.if) 7. With regard to the fact that, as you consider, the visit made to the lighthouse in question without previous information being given was at any rate discourteous, I find it necessary to inform you that, in connexion with all light houses and buoys, representations have recently been made to His Britannic Majesty’s Legation, with the request that necessary instructions may be given to the competent officials to afford the required facilities to the naval experts of the Imperial Government in the performance of their duties, and that you have, in that part of your esteemed note, mentioned this request of the Imperial Government. Therefore I do not think that any discourteous conduct has occurred in this respect. I avail, &amp;c. BAGHER KAZEMI.

[E 5348/3062/34] Mr. Mallet to Sir John Simon.—(Received September 12) (No. 407.) 1 HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of a note addressed to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of lighting and buoying in the Persian Gulf. Copies have been sent to the Acting Political Resident, Bushire, and the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Tehran, August 22, 1933. Enclosure in No. 1. Air. Mallet to Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. M. le Ministre, Gulhek, August 22, 1933. I HAVE the honour to inform your Highness that upon the 23rd July (1st Mordad) the warship Palang of the Imperial Persian navy, visited the Island of Tamb. 2. A party consisting of an engineer officer, a survey officer and a third official (who was doubtless the expert in lighting and buoying recently engaged by the Imperial Government), landed on the island and visited the light-house. They remained there about ten minutes and drew a sketch plan. Before leaving the officer gave the light-house keeper a signed paper stating that he had visited the light-house and that he had found everything in order. 3. In the course of conversation the party informed the light-house keeper that the Persian Government were taking over all lights in the Persian Gulf, and intended to erect new ones. 4. Your Highness is, of course, well aware that the claim of tne Imperial Government to the ownership of the Island of Tamb is not iccognised by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, and that the island is m the possession of the Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah. I he Imperial Government a T ie furthermore precluded from taking any action in support of their claim by tne existing agreement for the observance of the status guo in the Persian Gulf as long as negotiations for a general treaty are continuing. T t ^ 5. In these circumstances His Majesty s Government m the United Kingdom and the Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah are entitled to take strong exception Xo the visit of a Persian warship to the Island of Tamb witnout pnoi notification through the diplomatic channel. , . , . (2) To the official inspection by Persian officers of a hgfit-house winch is neither the property of the Imperial Government nor situated on Persian soil. 6. Although it is scarcely necessary for me to comment upon these two points I have tlie honour to observe with regard to the first that the attltllde the Imperial Government in sending a warship to visit the island without notification is in striking contrast to the attitude adopted by His Majesty s Government in the parallel case of the Island of birri, as exemplified m my no e of the 29th July (7th Mordad), and with regard to the second, tiiat the despatch of a party to inspect the light-house without prior warning at a time when a request had only recently been made for the grant of facilities and assistance to the expert engaged by the Imperial Government, would hardly have been courteous even if the light-house had bee n on Persian soil. [915 m—5] ENCLOSURE IN WtEKlY LU i NO. *2i 19 OCT. m FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL AffO SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICE7. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have instructed me to enter a vigorous protest against these visits, in their own name and in that of the Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah, and I shall be glad if your Highness will furnish me with an explanation for the information of His Majesty’s Government, and at the same time with an assurance that stringent orders will be issued., forbidding the repetition of this or similar acts in the future. 8. In view, moreover, of the oral statement made by the Persian officer in the course of his visit to the light-house and of the signed statement left by him on his departure, His Majesty’s Government must place it on record that they cannot admit any interference by the Imperial Government with this or other lights, beacons, buoys or other navigation guides in the Persian Gulf when these are situated neither on Persian soil nor in Persian territorial waters.

Steps were taken during the course of the year to ascertain whether the Sheikh of Bas-el-Khaimah would be willing to grant the Persian G-overnment a lease of the Islama of xamb m the event of such a lease being necessary for the conclusion of a satisfactory treaty. The sheikh indicated his willingness, subject to the following conditions !• ^Sag should continue to fly and his representative should remain. P. Kis subjects should not be interfered with without reference to him. 3. Persian customs vessels should not visit Oman waters to search Arab dhows; if goods prohibited by Persia were found^in one of his subject's dhows the iersian authorities should not take action directly, but should refer to him through His Majesty's 'Government. (He explained to the Residency agent that he feared Tamb being made a base for customs searches in the neighbourhood which might annoy not only his own subjects, but’ his fellow-sheikhs.) 4. Absconding indebted divers should be handed over. 5. Merchandise imported into the island for his personal requirements should be free of duty, as also fooa-stuffs imported by the inhabitants. 6 . The annual rental to be paid in advance. 7. Any flagstaff erected by the Persian Government should be over a building and mot on the ground. 8 . The conditions should be enforced by His Majesty's ‘Government. 206 . It was observed that these conditions were likely to nullify the value of the lease to the Persian. 'Government. Condition 3 was the subject of some speculation, but it was thought that the second part was intended to refer to the territorial/territorial waters of lamb only. No further steps were taken with regard to these conditions, since the negotiations were in abeyance.Hu 35 33 Under Secretary of State, The reply to he given to these telegrams has been discussed with Colonel Fowle and with the Foreign Office. There is general agreement that the line proposed by Colonel Loch is the right one, but the Foreign Office are very anxious to do nothing which would lead the Sheikh of Bas-al-Khaim&amp;h to think that we should not in any circumstances be prepared to agree to a lease of Tarnb, since this may come up for discussion in the forthcoming negotiations if they are resumed. They have, however, concurred in the draft telegram now attached, which was prepared in consultation with Colonel Fowle, ana which may, I submit, be authorised for issue.

I refrained from troubling you with continuation of the discussion; but as I have now to dispose of all outstanding questions, I thought it appropriate to show that my statement was not without a basis and thus to have the last word. Therefore I herewith enclose a copy of a letter written by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to Sir Arthur Harding, on the 26th of Eabi ol Avval 1323 (one year after Sir Arthur Harding’s letter of which Your Excellency sent me a copy) in which the Persian Minister lor Foreign Affairs plainly states, that having submitted to His Imperial Majesty the result of the conversation which he had with His Excellency few days ago, His Majesty had ordered that the Customs authorities in the Islands of Tamb and Abu Musa should postpone temporarily the measure taken by them and that no flag should be hoisted on the Islands until an arrangements be arrived at. We have not seen any reply to this letter in the archives of the Foreign Ministry. Therefore the logical conclusion is that if Sir Arthur Harding had no authority to be party to such an understanding he ought to have written his veto. I avail myself of the opportunity to assure Your Excellency of my high consideration. (Signed) G.DJELAL ttis Excellency R.H.Hoare. FICOPY IN TRANSLATION. Mushir-ed-Dowleh.

July 1st, 1932. My dear Oliphant, Jelal came to see me by appointment and under Peroughi’s instructions today. He is, as you probably know, a little woolly and Peroughi also has a tendency to vagueness. He talked about various items of current business and about the treaty. At first he conveyed the impression that he was bringing a definite message from Peroughi; later he said that he had more or less casually asked Feroughi how the treaty was getting on and he was repeating confidentially what Peroughi said. He reports him as saying that things were not getting on at ail; that the Persian Government were quite willing to come to an arrangement about Henjam and Bahrein but 'it was ^ — very difficult for them because His Majesty 1 s Government apparently would do nothing f to save their face’ (I’m not clear whether ’save their face’ is Jelal’s own or Peroughi’s) over Bahrein by giving them Tamb and Abu Musa: I had promised to try and persuade His Majesty’s Government”. (I assured him I had made no such promise and told him uhat I had said about Tamb and Abu Musa and he then corrected his statement). Jelal - definitely speaking as from himself - said the Government had made so much noise about Bahrein that they must have something to show for it and it had become a matter of amour propre. Jelal, still speaking as from himself went on to say that ll r Lancelot Oliphant, K.C.M.G. , C.B., The Foreign Office.) i that twenty three years ago 'the Sheikh of Shargah went and hoisted his flag at Tamh and Afcu Musa: the Persians wanted to kick him out but we asked them not to tackle him themselves, and — W0 - u - 1 ^- arrang e matters for them . I sa id I didn't believe for a moment we'd made any such promise and he said he'd seen it himself. In the time availahle it is not possible to do more than establish that Jelal’s tf twenty three years ago” is probably a mistake for 1983 (see paragraph 30 on page 102 of the Persian Gulf memo P.G.13). Perhaps the Department will feel disposed to see whether there is anything however remote ly resembling a promise to do something! I interpret this visit as a gentle hint from Peroughi that it is time to get on with the negotiations. There is no time for more. I am sending a copy of this letter to India (No.141) and to Bushire (No.104). Yours ever, (Sgd) R.H.Hoare. Icopy (E 3631/3631/91) FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l 27th July, 1932. My dear Hoare Many thanks for your letter of the 1st July on the subject of your recent conversation with Jelal about the Persian claim to Tamb and Abu Musa. We have not had time to go very thoroughly into the question which you raise in paragraphs 4 and 5, but as a result of a pre liminary investigation we think that Jelal must have been refer ring to the 1904 incident, not to that which occurred in 19S3. It was in 1904 that Trucial flags were hoisted for the first time in the islands, and it was on that occasion that the Legation, in a successful endeavour to persuade the Persians to withdraw from Tamb and Abu Musa rather than wait to be evicted by main force, undertook to forward to the Government of India any proofs which the Persians might wish to advance in support of their claim to sovereignty. You will find accounts ot the incident in Lo rimer* s Gazeteer of the Persian Gulf, p. '745, and also in P.G.13, (pp. 100 and 101). Admittedly the accounts given by Lorrimer and in P.G.13 are very different from Jelal's story, and the incident happened twenty-eight years ago, not twenty-three; but Jelal, as you say, is very woolly. It would be interesting if you could ascertain from him himself the number and date of the note in which the Legation are alleged to have promised to ’’arrange matters for the Persian Government”. If we are able to trace any further papers bearing on the subject we will let you know. Our own archives may not be as full as the Legation’s on the subject of the 1904 incident, but they may yet produce something of interest.

Yours ever, EASTERN DEPARTMENT• COPY SENT BY AIR MA.L of The Chancery, British Legation, TehranINDIA OFFICE P. 4512/28. Status of the Islands of Tamb, Little Tamb, Abu Musa, and Sirri. §&gt; CONFIDENTIAL. I. —Introductory. 1. Tamb, Abu Musa, and Sirri are three small islands lying well out in the Persian Gulf between the Trucial Arab coast and the Persian island of Kishm. Little Tamb, an uninhabited and waterless island, 1 mile long by | mile wide, 8 miles to the west of Tamb, was agreed by the Government of India, the India Office and the Foreign Office in 1908, to depend from that island. 0 Tamb itself is an island 17 miles south of the south-west point of Kishm Island and 46 miles north-west of the nearest point on the coast of Trucial Oman, roughly circular in shape, and about 2J miles in diameter. A lighthouse was erected on it by His Majesty’s Government in 1913 (see paras. 25 to 28 below). It is sparsely inhabited and almost waterless. It appears probable that deposits of red oxide are to be found both in it and in Little Tamb. Abu Musa is a larger and more thickly populated island, a few miles nearer to Shargah in Trucial Oman than to Lingah in Persia, with good supplies of water, and valuable deposits of red oxide which have been under exploitation for some years, and royalty in respect of which is paid to the ruling family of Shargah. Sirri, 40 miles south by west of Bustaneh, the nearest point on the Persian coast, is more prosperous and fertile than Tamb, and, like it, contains deposits of red oxide, though these are apparently unimportant.+ 2. The history and status of these islands is identical. While, however, the Trucial Sheikh of Shargah on the Arab coast still controls Tamb and Abu Musa, on which he hies his flag, His Majesty’s Government, and the Sheikh under protest, have since 1887 tacitly acquiesced in Persian occupation of Sirri. The Persian flag was stated to have been hois Led on Little Tamb in 1901} at the time of the Persian aggression on Tamb and Abu Musa. It was presumably removed at ihe same time as it was removed from those islands ; but the Political Resident reported in November 1908 that the Shargah flag had not been flown on Little Tamb by the Sheikh.§ It is not known whether steps have since been taken to do this. 3. The islands are claimed by the Trucial Sheikhs of Shargah as representative of the Jowasimi Arab chiefs, one section of whom in the 18th century established themselves by force or alliance at Lingah and elsewhere in South Persia. The Persian claim to the islands has in the past been based on the fact that the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs of Lingah, under whose administrative control they were for many years prior to 1887, had for long been Persian subjects governing Lingah as Persian officials, and it was suggested that it was in this capacity that they had administered the islands, which had become Persian territory. The latest Persian claim is based on the fact that the islands, together with Farur, are shown as Persian in a War Office map of 1887 of which copies were presented to the Shah by the Minister at Teheran, under the orders of Lord Salisbury, in July 1888 (cp. paras. 34 and 36 below). 4. The recent reassertion of the Persian claim to the island of Tamb renders necessary a more detailed examination of the history of that island, and of the islands of Abu Musa and Sirri, the status of which is identical, than would otherwise have been the case. Persian ownership of Farur does not appear to have been disputed in the past; the island is in any event in a different category from Abu Musa, Tamb and Sirri, and no reference is made to it in the present Memorandum. * I.O.to P.O., Deo. 2 1908, P. 2111/08, 3369/08 ; F.O. to Messrs.

It has proved impossible to trace any reference to the history of the islands in the 17 th and 18th centuries. From 1720 the Arabs of Ras-al- 3053Khaima on the Trncial Coast (hereafter referred to as the Jowasimi) had been active on the Persian littoral of the Gulf, on which before 1727 they seized Basidu. In 1737 they were attacked in their own territory by Persia Lor. i, 631 - 2 . an j appear to have made submission, 5 ' but it does not seem that Persia retained any hold on Ras-al-Khaima. 6. About 1750 a portion of the Jowasimi tribe crossed the Gulf to aid the Persian Governor of Bander Abbas and Ormuz against the then Shah, when they took possession of Lingah, opposite the island of Kishm, and other places on the Persian Coast. Lingah they continued to hold until the deposition by Persia of the last Arab Sheikh of Lingah in 1887. But for a number of years before that date, while Lingah np to about 1882 remained a tribally administered Arab principality, the ruling Sheikhs had gradually come under the power of the Persian Government, having finally acknowledged Lor. i, 2063 - 4 . themselves Persian subjects, paying to the Persian Governor-General of Fars such tribute as he could exact from them, and governing Lingah as Persian officials. t Pol. Res. to Minister, Teheran, Aug. 19 1888. Tel. from Pol. Res. to S. of S. for I., T. 234, Aug. 22 1928. P. 4558. 7. It is not clear whether any effective dominion had been exercised by Persia in the islands of Tamb, Abu Musa and Sirri prior to 1750. It seems entirely clear that no effective dominion was exercised in any of them by her between that date and the seizure of Sirri in 1887. In the intervening period, if not from a much earlier date, the islands were apparently part of the hereditary estates of the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs, the Sheikhs on the Arab shore having an equal interest with those on the Persian littoral. Their management, administration, and jurisdiction had, however, for many years prior to 1887 by common consent been vested in the chief Jowasimi Sheikh of the Persian coast, viz. the Sheikh of Lingah, but in his capacity of Jowasimi Sheikh and not of Persian official!—a state of things which would appear to have arisen from the fact that Tamb was for a period used by Lingah Jowasimi more than by other Jowasimi.No recognition of Persian suzereignty in respect of any of the islands had been made by the Jowasimi Arabs of Oman. 8. Up to about 1873, owing to the close connection existing between Tamb and Lingah, the Residency authorities at Bushire took the view that Tamb was Persian, and in the period ending with 1879 several enquiries regarding it are stated to exist in the Residency records. In 1882, however, in reply to an enquiry, the Residency Agent stationed at Shargah, on the Trucial Coast, furnished the Resident with translations of letters to the Sheikh of Shargah which established the rights of the Trucial Chiefs. Copies of these letters were produced in another connection in 1900 by the Residency Agent, who stated that he had himself seen the originals, to s^of s m for°i Re8 ’ Endeavours are now being made to see if the originals can be produced.|| -34, Aug. ^2 The Persian claim was first asserted in 1877, and has been repeated in 1904, 1923, 1926 and 1928. The history of these incidents is as follows. J G. of I. Pro ceedings, Sept. 1888. -§ Tel. to Res., Sept. 26 1887. III.—Occupation of Sirri by Persia, 18874 10. In the year 1877 an armed Persian party, with two small cannon, was sent to erect a flagstaff and hoist the Persian flag on Sirri. The Political Resident, the Minister at Teheran, having enquired§ whether the islands were under British protection, and whether any action at Teheran was necessary, replied that Sirri and Tamb were beyond the zone of Persian interference, and that the islands belonged to Arab Chiefs under British protection in common with Arabs of the Persian littoral. The Resident separately reported to the Government of India that the islands formed part of the hereditary estates of the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs ; that for many years, however, their management, administration and jurisdiction had by common consent been vested in the chief Jowasimi Sheikh on the Persian coast, viz., the Sheikh of Lingah for the time being ; that the Jowasimi Sheikhs domiciled on the Persian coast had acquired the status of subjects of Persia, and those who governed Lingah had been, in fact, Persian officials qua Lingah-; that the Persian claim was doubtless based on these grounds ; and that, were it not for the fact that the Arab Sheikhs of the Oman coast jointly owned the islands, the Persian position could not be disputed. TheResident supported his statement with the translation of a letter written in 1877 by the Sheikh Ali-bin-Khalifah of Lingahto the Chief of Ras-al-Khaima, in which the former “ admits that Tamb is a dependency of the Kowasim of Oman, and that the Persians have no property there nor any right to “Ainterfere, save with the consent of the Chief of Ras-al-Khaima.” In conclusion, he expressed the opinion that the Persian Government had no good title to the islands in question.|| 11. The Sheikh of Shargah protested to the Resident on IGth October 1887 against the Persian action at Sirri, and asked that similar action at Tamb might be prevented. Idle Government of India felt, however, some difficulty as to the action to be taken, in view of the fact that Persian Jowasimis had joint rights on Sirri and Tamb, and that one Arab Sheikh only had appealed, and it was agreed, in consultation with the Resident, that, no overt action having been taken by Persia in the case of Tamb, representations at Teheran should be confined to the question of Sirri.' ::: ' 12. On representations being made, the Persian Government stated! that for nine years Sirri and Tamb had paid taxes to the Persian Government, and that, documents in support of the Persian claim being at Bushire, the Governor had been instructed to explain matters to the Resident. The Governor, however, informed the Resident that “ he had no documents relating to the Persian claim, and that he had wired to the Amin-es-Sultan excusing himself from discussing the question with the Resident.”! Enquiry w r as independently made of the Chief of Shargah as to the Amin-es-Sultan’s statement. The Chief’s reply explained the connection of the Governors of Lingah with the island of Sirri, and added that Tamb was uninhabited, and that no taxes had been paid to Persia. He further enclosed three letters from Chiefs of Lingah, admitting the Chief of Shargah’s ownership of Tamb.§ 13. The Persian Government had meanwhile produced five official letters from a former Sheikh of Lingah (Yusuf-bin-Mahomad) in support of the Persian claim to the two islands.I| The Resident,^ after examination, replied “ that he considered that the documents did not bear out the Persian claim, and that weight should not be attached to the statements of the Sheikh in question, who was a dependant and servant of the Jowasimi Sheikh, Ali- bimKhalifah [cp. para. 10 above], whom he murdered in order himself to become Chief of Lingah,” and, the Persian Minister appearing to rely on a statement of Sheikh Yusuf that he had “gone to the island of Sirri to inspect and recover Government (Persian) dues,” the Resident wrote that he considered that “ this statement could not be accepted as establishing or even supporting the Persian claim to possession, nor as sufficient to deprive the Jowasimi Arab family of their ancient and previously recognised rights on that island.” (It may be added that on 29th March 1884 Sheikh Yusuf wrote to the Chief of Ras-al-Khaima fully admitting the possession of Tamb by the Jowasimis.)§§ The Resident further pointed out that the Jowasimi Sheikhs of Lingah' had usually also been Deputy-Governors of Lingah on behalf of Persia; they exercised authority on Sirri island, but it was qua Jow T asimi Sheikh and not qua Persian Governor. 14. A reply on the lines of the Resident’s report was sent to the Amin- es-Sultan by Her Majesty’s Minister on 2nd March 1888. The Persian Government, on enquiry 'being made** as to the grounds on which they had annexed Sirri, replied!! that it was in their possession, being a dependency of Lingah, to which the Legation replied that jurisdiction over Sirri had been exercised by the Governors of Lingah solely in their capacity of Jowasimi Sheikhs, that the traditional rights over Sirri of the Jowasimi Sheikhs had never been disputed and were generally recognised, that the hoisting of the Persian flag altered the existing status, and that it was on this ground that Her Majesty’s Government desired that reasons should be shown for this alteration. The note, after adding that while “ possession, if of long standing, and undisputed, undoubtedly carried considerable weight . . . the argument would scarcely govern in the present instance,” concluded by asking the Persian Government to com municate “ the proofs they possess of the former dependence of Sirri island on Persian authority.” || Pol.

On the 28th April 1888 the Resident communicated to the Minister at Teheran a copy of the translation of a report drawn up locally for the Amin-es-Sultan, which he had obtained privately, relative to the Persian claims. It appears that “ there was nothing fresh in this report beyond a new claim put forward to the island of Abu Musa,” which, again to quote thes^ Resident, “ has no justification whatever.” In the summer of the same year (26th July) the Minister telegraphed to Bushire that a reply had now been received from the Persian Government that “ as the Jowasimi Sheikhs were Persian Governors of Lingah, they considered no further proof of the justice of their claim necessary.” To this the Resident replied that the Persian reply begged the question, and that the Arab contention as regards Sirri was that the Jowasimi Sheikhs of Lingah represented the family, and derived no right from their position towards the Persian Government. 16. In order to facilitate the disposal of other negotiations, His Majesty's Government decided in August 1888 tacitly to acquiesce in the Persian occupation of Sirri. Save, however, by such acquiescence, to which reference was made in official correspondence with Persia in 1904 (see para. 21 below), they have never in any way admitted or withdrawn their original objections to the claim of the Shah’s Government to the ownership of the island, while the Political Resident stated in 1904 that it was equally clear from the Residency records that the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast had never voluntarily dropped their claim, which they had formally reiterated in 1895, to proprietary rights over Sirri, any more than over Abu Musa and Tamb. IV.—Temporary Persian Occupation of Ahu Musa and Tamb, 1904. 17. In January 1903 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that, trade having to a large extent been diverted from Lingah as the result of the short-sighted policy of the Belgian Customs officials, Lingah merchants were endeavouring to arrange with the Bombay and Persian Navigation Company to make the island of Abu Musa a port of call. He added that, in view of the Sirri incident of 1887, he was apprehensive lest the result might be the advancing of a territorial claim to this island by Persia. The Resident stated that the island undoubtedly belonged to the Jowasimi Sheikh of Shargah, that the Jowasimis did not, however, fly a flag on the island, and that it might be well to advise the Sheikh of Shargah to do so as a sign of ownership. This course was approved and action taken accordingly. 18. ^ The question having arisen of advising the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaima (a sheikhdom at that time and now dependent from the Sheikh of Shargab) to adopt a similar course in regard to the island of Tamb, which belonged to the Ras-al-Khaima section of the Jowasimis, the Resident reported that, so far as he was aware, sovereignty over that island had never been asserted by Persia, that the Sheikh of Shargah in his existing capacity as Ruler of Ras-al-Khaima claimed it as an appanage of the Jowasimis of the Arab coast, and that he was in possession of documentary evidence in the shape of letters from two former Arab Chiefs of Lingah admitting the claim of the Jowasimis of the Arab coast to those islands, as against the claim of the Jowasimis of Lingah. It was decided that the Chief should be advised to hoist his flag on Tamb as on Abu Musa, and this was done. 19. In April 1904 the \ iceroy telegraphed that the Belgian Customs officials had placed guards on Abu Musa and Tamb, forcibly removed the Aiab flags,^ erected new flagstaffs and hoisted the Persian flag on both islands, ihis action led to immediate protest by the Sheikh of Shargah, vho appealed to His Majesty’s Government, under his treaty relations with them, to take the necessary steps to prevent such interference in his territory. 20. Ihe Government of India, who took a serious view of the incident, pioposed to despatch a gunboat to the islands, with a representative of the Sheikh of Shargah on board, to haul down the Persian flag, reinstate the Jowasimi flag and remove the guards to Persian territory. It was decided,! , however, to give the Persian Government the opportunity to withdraw from the position they had taken up, and on the 24th May the Minister reportedthat they had telegraphed orders to Bushire to remove the flags and guards from Abu Musa and Tamb, while reserving their right to discuss with His Majesty’s Government the respective claims to the island. Their Note4 however, stated that Persia considered these two islands as its property,” ~\and proposed that “ neither party ” should hoist flags in them pending settlement of the question. 21. The Note of reply sent to the Persian Government on 15th June 1904, while expressing willingness to transmit to the Government of India any proofs that the claims of Persia to the ownership of these islands outweighed those of the Sheikh of Shargah, stated that the suggestion that the Sheikh of Shargah should not be permitted to replace his flag, hauled down by the Persian Customs officials, could not be accepted, and went on : “I would remind you, in this connection, that we have not insisted on the Persian Government removing their flag from the island of Sirri till the controversy between the two Governments as to the ownership of the island, which originated many years ago, has been reciprocally settled. The position would have been different if the Sheikh of Shargah had removed an existing flag from Tamb and Abu Musa; what he did was to hoist his own flag upon the islands, which were not yet formally occupied by any other Government, and he has the right to fly it, as the first occupant until his lawful possession of these islands is disproved.” 22. The Persian flags were removed, and the Jowasimi flag of the Chief of Shargah re-hoisted in June 1904. No serious attempt was made by Persia to produce proof of Persian ownership,*' and the discussion lapsed, though in 1905 a complaint by Persia of the erection of new buildings at Tamb by the Sheikh of Shargah w r as investigated and found to be baseless.']’ 23. The opportunity was taken to make it clear to Persia that the status of Sirri was still sub judice, a view r in which she acquiesced, and the Persian Government were warned in 1905 that “ the revival of their claim to Tamb meant the revival of ours to Sirri.” V.—Status of Sirri, 1909. 24. The question of granting a concession to mine red oxide on Sirri having arisen in 1908-9, His Majesty’s Government, after consultation with the Government of India, informedJ a British firm that, while the status of the island was in dispute, they had never acquiesced in the Persian claim to dispose of concessions on it regardless of Great Britain ; and the Minister at Teheran presented a protest to the Persian Government in April 1909 against their action in granting a concession, in which he reminded them of the caveat entered by His Majesty’s Government and asked them to arrange for the discontinuance of operations on the island by their concessionnaire.§ VX &gt; —1912-3 : Erection of a Lighthouse on Tamb Island. Communications to Persian Government and to Sheikh of Shargah. 25. Earlv in 1912 it was decided to erect and maintain a lighthouse on Tamb Island.[j With the approval of His Majesty’s Government no communication on the subject was made to Persia,^} but the Political Resident, Sir Percy Cox, was authorised**' to obtain the consent of the Sheikh of Shargah, which was granted by the Sheikh subject to an assurance that his rights of sovereignty were not affected.|t Sir Percy Cox, in writing to the Sheikh, added that while it was desirable that the Shargah flag should always be en evidence on Tamb, “now at all events this island will be preserved for you by the mere presence of the lighthouse.” 26. In October 1912, in reply to an enquiry by the Governor of the Gulf Ports, Sir Percy Cox stated that, with the concurrence of the Sheikh of Shargah, a light was about to be erected there.

In February 1913 the Persian Foreign Office raised the question with the Minister at Teheran, urging that the ownership of the island was' contested by Persia. Sir Percy Cox, on reference being made to him, intimated§§ that he had recently made it clear to the Governor of the Gulf Ports that the ownership of Tamb was not open to question, and added that ‘‘since the correspondence of 1905 the subjects of the Sheikh of Shargah and his flag have remained established on the island ” ; that if the question was now reopened His Majesty’s Government would no doubt revive the question of Sirri; but that a flat refusal to discuss it would probably be best. 28. The matter does not appear to have been taken further by Persia. The light was exhibited at Tamb on 15th July 1913, and His Majesty’s Government agreed that notification of its erection should be made to foreign consular representatives in the usual manner by the Government of India. 111| YII.—Statements made by His Majesty’s Government to German Government as to ownership of Abu Musa, 1907-14. 29. It may be remarked at this stage that in the lengthy negotiations which took place with the German Government between 1907 and 1914 over the claim of Messrs. Wonckhaus in respect of the cancellation of their red oxide concession in Abu Musa by the Sheikh of Shargah, no reference was made to the Persian Government, who were, indeed, privately reminded by the Charge d’Affaires in 1908 of the incident of 1904, and warned against any attempt to renew the Persian claim.'' His Majesty’s Government con sistently referred, in their communications to the German Government, to the “sovereignty ” exercised in Abu Musa by the Sheikh, and a quantity of local evidence was produced to show that the ownership of Abu Musa vested in the ruling Sheikh of the Jowasimi of Oman residing at Shargah.f It would clearly have been impossible for His Majesty’s Government to have taken the very definite line actually taken by them vis-d-vis Germany had the status of the island been, in their view, a matter at all open to dispute. VIII.—Reassertion of Persian Claim to Tamb and Abu Musa, 1923. 30. In 1923 the Minister at Teheran reported that he had learned confidentially that the Persian coneessionnaire of the Hormuz red oxide concession, Moin-ut-lujjar, a person of great wealth and considerable political influence, was urging the Persian Government to raise the Persian claim to Abu Musa, couple it with that to Pahrem, and refer both to the Heaijue of Nations.J Sir P. Loraine was instructed by the Foreign Office to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the incident of 1904, when His Majesty’s Government had been prepared to take naval action to remove the Persian flag from Tamb and Abu Musa, and hint that revival of the Persian claim might lead 4Iis Majesty’s Government to take the measures then contemplated.§ 31. I he Minister made the required communication to the Prime Minister, making, however, no reference to Tamb in his Aide Memoire. His Highness made no reply on the matter of Abu Musa.JI Ten days later a Note asserting Persian rights over both Tamb and Abu Musa, “ of which notification was made to His Majesty’s Legation in the year 1903-4,” having been addressed to the Minister by the Persian Foreign Office, Sii 1 . Loraine adopted an uncompromising attitude, and returned the Note to the Prime Minister with a strongly worded covering letter.It seemed piobable that the despatch of the Note was due to ignorance on the part of the Acting Foreign Minister of the communication which had been made to the 1 rime Minister, and, the position of His Majesty’s Government having been made clear, the incident went no further.-Persian Customs Interference at Abu Musa, 1925-6. o2. In the autumn of 1925 the Persian customs authorities sent a launch to Abu Musa which inspected the red oxide and removed one bag. On a protest being made, they replied that Abu Musa belonged to Persia. Energetic action was taken at Teheran by His Majesty’s Minister, who reminded the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs of the 1923 correspondence, and subsequently warned him privately that persistence in the Persian claim would make it necessary “to request the Government of India to despatch a ship of war to Abu Musa to uphold the rights of the Sheikh of Shargah.”'-”-' The Persian Government withdrew, and the customs ** Teh. Desp. 2|8 authorities were instructed “not to take any steps in Abu Musa or Tamb f 9 9 F 6 0 P ’ pending reply from Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding status of these islands.” ■ to 1928, X.—Reassertion of Persian Claim to Tamb, 1928. 33. In July 1928 a Persian customs launch, which had been operating from Tamb for about two months, seized off the south of the island a Debai dhow carrying passengers to Khassab, on the Arab coast, with a small cargo of sugar and dates, and brought it to Lingah, where the cargo was confiscated as smuggled and the passengers imprisoned. The incident created a very serious situation on the Trucial Coast, the Trucial Chiefs being restrained only with difficulty from immediate reprisals; and its possible reactions proved a matter of grave concern to the Government of India. 34. Strong diplomatic representations by His Majesty’s Government at Teheran secured the release of the dhow and its passengers and crew. The cargo remains under seizure, and a claim for compensation has been met by a reiteration of the Persian claim to ownership of Tamb, based, according to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, on a British Note dated 27th July 1888, signed by His Majesty’s Minister under instructions from the Marquess Teh. tei. 250 of Salisbury, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, communicating a p' f ^ 0 ^ ug ' 24 map “recently issued by the Intelligence Department of the War Office” for presentation to the Shah on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government. The Charge d’Affaires has indicated that the argument is unsubstantial, while the fact cannot clearly in itself affect the validity of the Arab claim ; but it is clear that in the forthcoming negotiations with Persia, not only the immediate Tamb incident, on which the Government of India have expressed themselves very strongly, but the position of Abu Musa (and of Sirri) will come up for disposal. XI.—Summary. 35. The effective occupation of Sirri by Persia since 1887, and the tacit acquiescence in that occupation of His Majesty's Government, make it difficult, if not impossible, at this stage to dispute the Persian claim, though His Majesty’s Government are not estopped by any formal admission on their part from using the Shargah claim to the island for bargaining- purposes. 36. The position is different as regards Tamb and Abu Musa. At no stage has the Persian claim been formally admitted, and at no stage has it been allowed to pass unquestioned. The argument in support of the latest Persian claim as set out in para. 34 above could be strengthened, so far as it has any value, by reference to the fact that the islands are also shown in Persian colours on Lord Curzon’s (unofficial) Map of Persia of 1892, and on the Survey of India Map of 1897.While, however, the error in question * Teh tel t() is extremely regrettable from the standpoint of His Majesty’s Government, Viceroy, April 20 it cannot be taken as a formal declaration by His Majesty’s Government of their view of the status of the islands, nor, it is suggested, can it be regarded as of substantial importance in view of the consistent repudiation, before -and after the dates mentioned, of the Persian claim.I*****-’ 3Y. As regards the merits of that claim, the historical summary above shows that the history of the islands prior to 1750 is obscure; that since that date such authority and such effective occupation as there has been has had its source in the Jowasimi Arabs, who between 1750 and 1820- exercised in the Gulf a maritime control uncontested by Persia. There is r nothing to show that those Arabs, having obtained a footing on the Persian coast, thence derived authority over outlying islands. Probability suggests rather that they carried with them to their new settlement a position in the islands which they already possessed. The fact that a section of these Arab intruders later acquired the status of Persian subjects, and held their authority on the Persian coast in subordination to the Persian Government Pol. Res. to Minister, as local Chiefs or Governors, cannot affect any original rights the Jowasimi Teheran, Dec. 13 tribes on the Arab and the Jowasimi tribes on the Persian littoral may have had in common; an intimate connection appears to have been maintained between the two sections of the tribe, and the islands remained their common property and did not become Persian territory; nor, the islands being held by a Sheikh only on behalf of the tribes, had an individual power to alienate t Viceroy to s. of s. any sovereign territorial rights which he might enjoy qua ruler of these 16 1908 ’ tr ikes.t Finally, de facto possession resting with the Jowasimi Arabs of the Trucial Coast, it would appear to be for Persia, in the absence of evidence at any stage of effective Persian occupation or of acknowledgment by the Trucial Arabs of Persian overlordship in the islands, to prove the case for alteration of the status quo. 38. As between His Majesty’s Government and the Trucial Chiefs concerned, the latter, under their treaty engagements, are entitled to the protection of His Majesty’s Government and are not themselves allowed to communicate or negotiate direct with any foreign Power. Apart from the fact that their claim to the islands lias consistently been upheld by His Majesty s Government, it was on the initiative of IIis Majesty’s Government that the Jowasimi Sheikh of Shargah and Ras-al-Khaima hoisted his flag on Tamb and Abu Musa in 1903 (see paras. 17 and 18 above). 59. The satisfactory disposal of the matter is- important in view of its immediate reactions on the Trucial Coast, and the wider reactions on Mohammedan feeling in India of disturbance in that region. But its- importance from its possible reactions on the relations of the Trucial Chiefs with Ibn Sand is hardly less great. T ^ ' J. G. L.

Dated 23.7.31 2. The subject is largely of a technical nature, and I do not feel myself competent to add any detailed observations of value to those already made so fully by the two principal experts on the spot. I would merely draw your attention to the special and unwelcome problem which would be presented in an acute forni if °ne or more of these Persian naval units were to visit Bahrein. They might even be used for the purpose of giving effective fona to Persian claims to sovereignty over Tamb and Abu Musa. It will be recalled that the Island of Sirri, whose history, till 1887, was identical with that of Tamb and Abu Musa, has, since that date, been subject to Persian control for no better reason than that the Persian Goverrment of that time, though far more feeble than now, and possessing no navy of any kind, decided to occupy and present His Majesty’s Government with a fait ac compli. The proposal for a lease of Tamb made by the Minister of Court last October (see Sir Robert Clive’s despatch Ho. 526 of the 28th October, 1930), which would have implied Arab sovereignty, was dropped as soon as it was made. It may have been seen to have been a false move, and when it was mentioned to me by the head of the English section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the 12th instant, the latter was disavowed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs the next day (see my telegram Ho.149 of the 13th instant). It may perhaps be argued that such contingencies are unlikely, and thg,t the Persian Government may be trusted to avoid a situation so obviously fraught with the gravest possibilities of trouble. Be that as it may, I feel that, in view of the recent trend of Anglo-Persian relations, it would be unwise wholly to ignore such an eventuality. The Minister of Court has of late displayed a markedly defiant attitude where foreign relations are concerned, and it must be borne in mind that the ships now beingv&gt; « ■ being built will in reality have no other raison d'etre than the assertion of Persia's imagined rights in the Gulf. Caution ana political good sense are not conspicuous features of the new Persia, and the desire to damage British prestige among the Gulf Arabs is undoubtedly strong.» Under Secretary..

The conditions proposed by the Sheikh will be found in Colonel biscoe’s despatch of 11th Iky on P.Z # 3254/31 below. The Admiralty are, of course, keenly interested in this question because of Sir Robert Clive's earlier suggestion that it might be possible to do a deal with Persia on the basis of securing/a lease of Tamb in return for a lease, possibly on corresponding conditions, of Henjam. I have discussed this letter demi- officially with the Admiralty, who new agree that no action is called for at this stage. I pointed out that negotiations were suspended; that nothing was to be gained by examining the Sheikh’s conditions at this stage; but that in any case it was perhaps unlikely that we :• 1 f shouWv'lS /-XE % - / If. should get him to agree to any substantial modification without considerable difficulty. On the point made in paragraph 3 of the Admiralty letter, I pointed out that the Tamb incident of 1928 had clearly shown that, while we might protest diplomatically to the Persians in the event of their committing an act of aggression against craft belonging to the Trucial Sheikhs, there was little, if any, prospect of our getting satisfaction from them, and that in this particular case we had ourselves in the last resort been obliged to pay compensation of Rs.5,000 to the Sheikh. It may no doubt be possible, if and when the time comes, to secure certain modifications of the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaima's conditions and so to meet certain at any rate of the Admiralty criticisms. But nothing is to be gained by going into the qvestion now.

Political Resident remarks that the Shaikh’s conditions would seem to be such as largely to nullity the value of a lease to the Persians. v/e do not, however, know much of the Persians’ reasons for wanting a lease, as it would appear to be recognised that the island is not a smuggling base as originally alleged by them. If their principal reason is mainly face-saving, they are likely to take exception to paragraphs 1 and 7 of the conditions which would in any case appear inconsistent with a type of lease that conceded customs control, as is , le Und er-Secretary of State, INDIA OFFICE, S.W.l.implied by paragraph 5. 19 3 ! 3.- I am to suggest that the first sentence of paragraph 3 of the conditions is inappropriate and unnecessary. Customs supervision by Persia of Arab dhows outside Persian territorial waters is not permissible in any case and effective protest could be Wl .4 made if it is attempted. The remainder of this paiagiaph may be intended to refer merely to customs supervision in the territorial waters of Tamb but if so unis should be made clear. The condition is reasonable as we act as intermediaries between the Trucial Chiefs and foreign Powers, but unless it applies to Tamb waters only it would appear out of place in a lease of Tamb. 4.- Copies of this letter have been sent to the Foreign Office and Colonial Office.

Ihe Hnder Secretary of nate, India Office.3 Confidential* K.0174/31. 9th March 1931. Sir, i am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to refer to your letter of the 15th October ii. 5323/36/ 34, and to state that, as suggested by the Secretary of State, Fy Lords have given their consideration to the situation which may arise if the facilities now enjoyed by H.M. Ships at Benjam should cease to be available. If the negotiations for a lease are not successful, or if facilities were offered under such conditions as to be inacceptable, either Bahrein or Muscat might be considered as an alternative base. * There is no doubt, however, that Henjam is strategically and for other reasons by far the most suitable base in the Gulf, and My Lords consider therefore that it is desirable that every effort should be made to secure a lease on suitable terms. Sir R.Clive, at the meeting which was held at the Admiralty on the 22nd January to discuss the position of the negotiations with reference to the points affecting H.M. Uavy stated that he had some anxiety as to whether the Persians might not suddenly realise that Henjam would be of value to them as a base for the war vessels which they are having built in Italy nnd as a result refuse to let us have a lease. This emphasisfcthe need of getting the lease concluded as soon as possible and makes it *sirable, that we should press on with the question of a lease of Tamb to Persia which has been associated with the question of our lease of Benjam. My Lords are accordingly requesting the Secretary of State for India, to whose office a copy of this letter has been sent, to hasten the reply from the Government of India upon this matter which is awaited. A copy of the letter which has been addressed to the India Office is attached and a copy of this letter has also ^ _ been sent to the C.O. The TJ.S. of S. (Sgd) Charles Walker,i I Confidential . Not to fce quoted in official correspondence. Extract from a_private letter dated 5th November, 1930, from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I personally do not think Henjam is the only alternative, neither does the S.N.O. I think we could with a certain amount of expenditure, establish a much more convenient Base at Khor Kaliya on the Southern side of Bahrein. Haworth had it surveyed by the Nearchus. The pros and cons are as follows:- Pros . (1) We could do what we liked there. At present, if the i Navy want to level a cricket pitch at Henjam, authority has to be obtained from Teheran. This is a concrete case, at present under reference to the Minister. (2) If the Residency is transferred there, they would be in close contact with the Political Resident. (3) Normally one sloop is on the South oj the Gulf and one on the North. It would be a convenient centre, for we could arrange greater amenities, and naval officers would meet outside people. Cons . (1) It would cost about £15,000, possibly more, to dredge the entrance, light and buoy the place and erect canteens etc. (2) For 3 months in the year the climate is bad; worse than Henjam, but not, I think, worse than Basidu. During thest 3 months, however, one sloop could spend a good deal of time at Basrah, oiling at Abadan, and the other at Khor Jarama and Muscat, oiling at the latter place, where it is proposed to put a barge. The Admiralty will probably say it is not so suitable strategically/strategically. My answer is that in time of war, if you were not prepared to infringe the neutrality of Persia you could not use Henjam, and if we wero prepared to infringe the neutrality of Persia we could always occupy Henjam.”I Copy.

This island, although claimed by the Gultanate of of Muscat, has definitely been recognised by His Majesty’s Government on several occasions as under Persian sovereignty, and must be regarded as a part of Persia. 2). A part of the island has, since 1912, been used as a coaling station by His Majesty 1 s Ships in the Persian Gulf. It is now proposed if possible to regularise this position by treaty, and negotiations have been for some time in progress with the Persian Government for a lease of this part of the island, whereby His Majesty^ Ships shall continue to enjoy the existing facilities in connexion with fuelling and recreation for a period of twenty five or thirty years. The draft proposed by His Majesty’s Government includes a provision whereby His Majesty the Shah shall accord to His Britannic Majesty the right to arrange for the upkeep of the British cemetery; but the Persian Government have not hitherto accepted this provision, nor is it yet possible to say whether the proposed treaty will in fact be concluded. 4.

Under the Income Tax law of the United Kingdom a person resident: in the Ini ted Kingdom is liable to Income Tax on the whole of his income derived from sources in the United Kingdom or from sources abroad. Consequently a person (whether a natural person or a corporation) resident in the United Kingdom who carries on business partly in the United Kingdom and partly abroad is liable to United Kingdom Income Tax on the whole of his profits. If the part of the profits earned aborad is liable to taxation abroad, the tax so paid abroad is allowed to be debited as a trading expense in arriving at the profits assessable to United Kingdom Income Tax, but the tax so paid abroad is not allowed to be set off against the tax payable in the U nited Kingdom. 2. In these circumstances, the part of the profits earned abroad will be liable to double taxation and in a very large number of cases such double taxation actually exists. Various suggestions have from time to time been made for avoiding this double taxation and among them is the suggestion that the country is which the trader resides should allow from its own charge of duty a deduction equal to the amount of the tax charged abroad on the profits earned there. 3. This solution of the double taxation problem is not likely to commend itself to the United Kingdom Government. In fact such arrangements as have been made or are under discussion between the United Kingdom and foreign Governments for the avoidance of double income-taxation (e.g. in relation to profits arising from shipping businesses and from trade carried on through agents) proceed on the basis that the profits shall be taxed only by the country in which the trader resides, the country in which the profits arise giving up its claim to tax. 4. There is in existence between the United Kingdom and y-i- 4 y^' 0 v ? other parts of the British Empire a general scheme fcr the avoidance or relief of double income-taxation based on a different principle. But in this case special considerations prevail, in view of the close relations between the constituent members of the Empire, and it is not in contemplation to extent that scheme to foreign countries. And, clearly, it would not be possible to apply this principle to any one foreign country in particular (e.g. Persia) without applying it to all. It is therefore impossible to treat tne proposals of the Persian Government otherwise than as part of a general problem, the solution to which is not yet in sight. 14th January 1931. :’i ■Please see previous submission on ± , u, ^ ]0/ 31, and Colonel Biscoe f s despatch criticising the original Foreign Office proposals on P.2. 343/31.

Please see the Foreign Office letter of 8th DecemberrMThe memorandum enclosed m that letter (save on one minor point discussed below) accurately resumes the latest developments m connection with the Persian claim to Tamb and Abu Misa, and examines in detail the desirability of sounding the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khsimah as to his willingness to lease Tamb to the Persians for a period of, say, 50 years, in return for the recognition of his sovereignty v/hich such a lease would constitute, an annual rent, certain privileges in connection with user of the island , etc. The Foreign Office are inclined to think that it is undesirable to press for formal recognition by Persia of the Sheikh*s sovereignty (compare their letter of 31st December on P.Z. 39), and there is, I think, force in their suggestion (which is supported by their Legal Advisers) that the mere acceptance by Persia, of a lease of Tamb from the Sheikh and the payment to him of a money rent e . for the leas\ would by implication constitute an admission of the Sheikh’s sovereignty. If the Persians were prepared to enter into a formal lease and the Sheikh could be persuaded in return for this, and for an adequate annual rent, to agree to grant them a long lease of the island, a solution satisfactory to all parties would have been found to one of the more difficult and controversial questions involved in the present negotiations. The Foreign Office/Office and the Minister are probably optimistic in thinking that this is the only obstacle to a successful outcome of the negotiations. We are still far from-a settlement of the question of Bahrein, and the position as regards Abu Musa, undisputed possession of which would, in view ol the red oxide nines situated on it, be of great^commercial importance to Persia, is still obscure. But we may, I suggest, put the Foreign Office proposal to the Government! of India and the Political Resident. It is, I fear, not improbable that the Sheikh, who is in bad odour with his subjects and in a weak position generally at the present time, may be reluctant to face the local difficulties involved in any compromise in the matter with Persia. On points of detail:- (a) The maxinum rent which we are at present prepared to offer the Persians for Henjam is £1,000 a year (we have in fact offered £500 only). If the Persians were prepared to refund even £500 a year to the Sheikh ox Ras-al-Khaimah he would do exceedingly well, and it is possible that some smaller rental would in fact suffice. We need not examine this more closely at the present stage; but the difficulties likely to arise as a result of Persian failure to maintain their payments under the lease are patent, and some provision to cover the situation which would arise in the event of continued default or under payment will call for consideration if and when we get down to drafting a lease. (b) From the demi-official letters from the Foreign Office of 2nd January on P.Z. 67,fit will be seen that the Sheikhi garden and not his garrison was mentioned by Taimourtache to Sir R. Clive on 4th October. (c) Taimourtache in the interview of 4th October (compare/Minute Paper. Department. (compare paragraph 3 of Foreign Office precis on P.8510/ 30) stated that the Sheikh, if he agreed to a lease or to customs duties generally please see Mr. Baxter's letter of 12th January on PZ.Stffc/Sl. One would have thought that there was advantage in pitching our demands high, and that even if we restrict them to The chance of the Sheikh accepting the present proposals as a whole ia probably small, and the difference between to turn the scale, (d) A minor point which will require considera tion if the proposals now submitted are agreed by the ^ Sheikh and by the Persians will be the upkeep of the lighthouse on the island of Tamb. We need not perhaps take this point with the Government of India at this stage, but it may be noted that we have separately impressed on the Foreign Office that we regard it as of importance that effective responsibility should remain in British hands, and that this should be secui as part of the present bargain, . A draft letter to the Government of India con sulting them is submitted. It has been seen unofficial by the Foreign Office, who have suggested a redraft (now embodied) of paragraph 2. Additional paragraphs have been added to make it clear to the Government ’’would be exempt from customs duties”. On the question whether this applies to the personal needs of the Sheikh exemption for the personal requirements of the She;”' there will be ample scope for the raising of the difficulties by the Persian customs officers.

The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign &amp; Political Dept., NEW DELHI. IS, Y 2 3 ^N 1951 2 JAN 1931 4T93b 5000 10/30 31 Department. Z 3 JAN 1931 Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State to refer to the Foreign Office letter of 8th December, No. E 6161/1358/91, of which a copy was enclosed in my weekly letter, No. 50, of 11th December, 1930, on the subject of the Island of Tamb. 2. The Secretary of State agrees with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that the suggestion now put forward for a settlement by compromise, under which the Sheikh, while retaining his rights of sovereignty, would lease the island to the Persian Government for a term of years, is one which merits serious consideration. If the Government of India agree, he would be glad if the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf could be instructed to take the first possible opportunity of ascertaining from the Sheikh whether, in return for the receipt of a substantial yearly rent (on this point please see paragraph^ below), and, if this is considered desirable, special facilities of the nature offered by Taimourtache in his interview with Sir Robert Clive on 4th October, he would be prepared to/to lease his island to Persia for a period of 50 years. Apart from the considerable benefit which the Sheikh would derive from the substantial in increasejiis income, such an arrangement would offer him the advantage that the acceptance by Persia of a lease of Tamb from him and the payment by the Persian Government of an annual rent iin respect of their tenancy would clearly constitute an adijiission of the Sheikh’s sovereignty over the island. Subject [to the Government of India’s observations 1 , the Secretary of State considers therefore that every effort should be made to secure his consent in principle to it. Should the Sheikh be prepared to entertain it, the ground would then be clear for further consideration of the question in the event of the resuirption of the general negotiations with Persia. It will, of course, be understood that any such arrangement could be concluded only as part of a general treaty settlement of a nature satisfactory to His LSajesty’sl Government. 3. I am to say, in this connection, that the Secretary of State has considered in consultation with the Foreign Office the question whether it would be desirable to hold out to the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah as an inducement to/Draft Paper. Department. 4?93b 5000 10/30 to agree to lease Tamb to Persia the prospect of securing in the lease formal^ recognition by Persia of his sovereignty. While offorts would presumably be made in the first place to secure such recognition, it seems not improbable that sooner or later His Majesty’s Government will be confronted with the argument that for iace-saving and Parliamentary reasons the Persian Government cannot contemplate a formal renunciation of their claim to Tamb as well as of their claims to Bahrein and Abu Musa. This argument is one which can be considered on its merits if and when it arises. The Foreign Office, after consultation with their Legal Advisers, are, however, definitely disposed to consider that the mere acceptance by Persia of a lease of Tamb from the Sheikh and the payment to him of a money rent for the lease would by implication constitute an admission of the Sheikh’s sovereignty over the island, and wit^h thicr-viow the ^Secretary of State India? irj m gonoral-agroomontr. 4, On the question of the amount of the annual rent to be paid by Persia in the event of a settlement on the lines set out above, it will be remembered/ I \ - 3' remembered that Taimourtache has indicated his readiness to agree that it should be equivalent to that to be paid by His Majesty's Government in return for the facilities sought by tl^em at Henjam. His Majesty's Government and t | the Government of India have agreed to a joint payment of not more than £1,0C0 a year in respect of those facilities The offer of £500 a year which has be^n made to the Persian Government has, however, been ret by a demand for a rent of £2,000, to which no reply has been given. If a direct relation couljd be established between the rent to be paid for Henjam and that to be paid fcjr Tamb, it is possible that the Persian^ might be led to take a more reasonably view about the former, while a rent oi £500 a year might, it is hoped, go far to induce the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah to lease hisisland to the Persians on the terns set out above. I am to add, in this connection, that the difficulties to which Persian default or backwardness in the payment of this rent might giv3 rise are patent, and that it would be desirable, if and when the drafting of a lease is under examination, to consider the insertion of a provision to cover this contingency. 5.

He will let us have a re-draft of that letter in a few days’ time for our consideration^ I mentioned to him your point about the words 'pour ses besoins personnels'. Clive was not quite certain as to the exact words used by Teymourtache, but he, Clive, expressed the personal opinion that it would probably be both necessary and desirable, in any lease of Tamb to the Persians, to limit the exemption from customs duties granted to the Sheikh to the Sheikh's own personal requirements. Otherwise, he said, endless difficulties would surely arise with the Persian customs authorities. I J.G.Laithwaite, Esq, N rI therefore suggested that, at the present stage, the best course would be to omit the words 'pour ses besoins 'personnels' from the proposed letter to Teymourtache, but to make it clear to the Sheikh that customs exemption could probably be arranged only for his personal requirements.

It appears that the group decoded 'garrison' in the telegram can also he ’’garden'. I think we can take it therefore that it is the Sheikh's garden on the island of Tamb, and not his garrison, that was mentioned by Teymourtache to Clive on October 4th.

We shall presumably try in the first place to secure such recognition, but it seems highly probable that we shall sooner or later be faced with the argument that, for face- saving and Parliamentary reasons, the Persian Government cannot contemplate a formal renunciation of their claim to Tamb, as well as of their claims to Bahrein and Abu Musa. 2. As I indicated to you when we discussed the 3 . J. G.Laithwaite , Esq.OaTI o. 3. This argument can he considered on its merits, if and when it arises, but we here are definitely disposed to consider, after consultation with our Legal Advisers, that the mere acceptance by Persia of a lease of Tamb from the Sheikh, and the payment to him of a money rent for the lease, would by implication constitute an admission of the Sheikh's sovereignty over the island. 4. In these circumstances, we should like to suggest that you should substitute the following revised version of paragraph 2 for that given in your draft: n 2. The Secretary of State agrees with the ^ ’’Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that the ’’suggestion now put forward for a settlement by ’’compromise, under which the Sheikh, while 'retaining his rights of sovereignty, would lease ’’the island to the Persian Government for a term 'of years, is one which merits serious consideration. 'If the Government of India agree, he would be glad 'if the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf could 'be instructed to take the first possible opportunity 'of ascertaining from the Sheikh whether, in return 'forC±i9 for the receipt of a substantial yearly rent (on ’’this point please see paragraph 3 below), and, if this is considered desirable, special facilities of the nature offered by Teymourtache in his ’’interview with Sir Robert Clive on 4th October, he ’’would be prepared to lease his island to Persia for ' a Period of 50 years. Apart from the considerable benefit which the Sheikh would derive from the substantial increase in his income, such an 'arrangement would offer him the advantage that the 'acceptance by Persia of a lease of Tamb from him and 'the payment by the Persian Government of an annual 'rent in respect of their tenancy would clearly 'constitute an admission of the Sheikh’s sovereignty 'over the island. Subject to the Government of India’ 'observations, the Secretary of State considers 'therefore that every effort should be made to secure 'his consent in principle to it. Should the Sheikh ’’be prepared to entertain it, the ground would then 'be clear for further consideration of the question 'in the event of the resumption of the general 'negotiations with Persia. It will, of course, be 'understoodunderstood that any such arrangement could be concluded only as' part of a general treaty 5. We see no objection to the remainder of your draft. We also see no objection, if you think it desirable, to your adding a further paragraph, in the sense of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this letter, in order to make it clear to the Government of India why we do not wish to commit ourselves to the Sheikh on the point of securing a formal recognition of his sovereignty in the settlement of a nature satisfactory to His Majesty Government. n lease.P. 851C/SC. / INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, 3. 1. 16th December, 1930.

Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State to refer to the Foreign Office letter of 8th Decembpr, No. E 6161/1358/91, of which a copy was enclosed in my weekly letter, No. 50, of 11th December, 1930, on the subject of the island of lamb. 2. The Secretary of State agrees with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that the suggestion now put forward for a settlement by compromise, under which the Sheikh, while retaining his rights of sovereignty, would lease the island to the Persian Government for a term of years, is one which merits serious consideration. If the Government of India agree, he would be glad if the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf could be instructed to take the first possible opportunity of ascertaining from the Sheikh whether, in return for recognition in the lease of his sovereignty over Tamb, the receipt of a substantial yearly rent (on this point please see paragraph 3 below), and, if this is considered desirable, special facilities of the nature offered by Taimourtache m his interview/ i 4T93Binterview with Sir Robert Clive on 4th October, he would be prepared to lease his island to Persia for a period of 50 years. The advantages which such an arrangement would offeif from the point of view of the Sheikh; are obvious and, subject to the Government of India*s observations, the Secretary of State considers thalj every effort should be made to secur^ his consent in principle to it. v Should the Sheikh be prepared irogtcongthe groW would then be clear for further consideration of the question in the event of the resumption of the general negotiations with ersia. It will, of course, be understood that a condition of any such arrangement - which could be concluded only as part of a general treaty settlement of a nature satisfactory to His ? f ajesty’s Government - would be a formal abandonment by the Persians of their claim to Abu usa, together with their recognition of the sovereignty of the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah over Tamb. As regards this latter point, acceptance by Persia of a lease of the island from the Sheikh and the payment by the Persian Government of an annual rent in respect of their tenancy of it mighl be regarded as constituting a sufficiently definite admission of the Sheikh’s• r h .. „ ■ Draft Paper. f * soetftf sovereignty. This, however, is a point on which the Secretary of State would welcome the observations of the Government of India, and which can be considered further, if necessary, at a later stage. 3. On the question of the ammount of the annual rent to be paid by Persia in the event of a settlement on the lines set out above, it will be remembered.that Taimourtache has indicated his readiness to agree that it should be equivalent to that to be paid by His Majesty*s Government in return for ^ facilities sought by them at iienjam. His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India have agreed to a joint payment of not more than £1,000 a year m respect of those facilities. offer of £500 a year which has been made to the Persian Government has been met by a demand for a rent of '2,000, to which no reply has been given. If a direct relation could be established between the rent to be paid for Hen jam and tha to be paid for iamb, it is possible that the Persians might be led to take a more reasonable view about the 4? 93b 5000 10/30induce the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah to lease his island to the Persians on the terms set out above.

Sir, f 8510 ! 9 3 0 1 f / Foreign Office. i? S.W.l. 8th December, 1930. The With reference to paragraph 5 of Sir R.Clive’s ties pa ten u o.52 6 of the 28 th October, a copy of which was enclosed in Foreign Office letter No.E 6027/143/34 of the l‘±th November, I am directed by lir.Secretary Henderson to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a memorandum prepared in this department regarding the Persian Government’s attitude on the subject of the Island of Tamb. 2 . Sir K.Olive, since his return to this country, has emphasized in oral discussion that, in his opinion, the uncompromising attitude hitherto maintained by His Majesty’s Government in regard to this- question is one of the main obstacles to the conclusion of the proposed General Treaty with Persia; and, for this reason, and in view of the considerations set forth in the enclosed memorandum, Mr. Henderson considers it essential that every effort be made to seek a solution of this difficulty. While he recognises that a continued refusal to consider any Persian proposal in regard to this island would be justified, and that In any case there must be no question of forcing the Sheikh of Ras-el-Khaimah to agree to an inequitable solution, he feels that it would be deplorable if the negotiations for a treaty settlement of major political importance with Persia were to be allowed to break down unnecessarily on this particular issue. In his opinion therefore careful consideration Secretary of State, Y LETTER 5 0 \ ] DE.C 1§30 Office — , ENCLOf A HD x- « „ *v : •• * &gt; ft IT ^»• • &amp; ^ r ‘ b ^3 f ^ ' v. , v vl&gt; - - 'S 4^*7 9 consideration should be given to the new suggestion now puo forward for a settlement by compromise, under which t.L ; e oheikh, while maintaining his rights of sovereignty; would lease the island to the Persian Government for a term of years. °* TPiis proposal would not necessarily be to the bheikh's disadvantage. On -the contrary, the fact that the Sheikh’s sovereignty over the island would thus at length be formally recognised by the Persian Government might be of benefit to him in future, while it should not prove impossible to make arrangements whereby he would in practice retain, with increased security, ail the rights and facilities in the island which he enjoys at present, though precariously. The details of any lease to be concluded would need careful consideration; but, in Hr .Henderson f s opinion it should be possible to establish the principle that the conditions of the lease should be analogous to those of the proposed lease of Henjam to His Majesty's Government. In this case, the matter should be simplified, and the connexion of the two questions might well, as suggested in paragraph 6 of the memorandum, present solid advantages. 4. Mr.Renderson trusts that the Secretary of State for India will concur in his view that the Sheikh of Ras-el- Khaimah should be approached in this matter, and that in that case Mr.Benn will invite the Government of India to instruct the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to make every effort on the above lines to secure the Sheikh's consent in principle to the lease of Tamb to the Persian Government. 5.°* Gopies of this letter are being sent to the Colonial Office, Dominions Office, Admiralty and the Air Ministry. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,The islands of famb and Abu Musa, owned by the Sheikhs of Has el Khaimah and bhargah respectively, are claimed by Persia, and it has hitherto been impossible to induce the Persian Government to contemplate, even as a part of a general settlement of outstanding questions, the abandonment of their claim. 2. The bheikh of Has el Khaimah was asked last May if he would consider the sale of famb to Persia. After discussion with the Sheikh of Shargah, he replied that he would not agree to sell the island for any sum whatever. o. sir R*Clive had an unsatisfactory conversation with the Persian Minister of Court on October 4, in which f 'rR/ Teymourtache offered to abandon the claim to Abu Musa if Persia could be given Tamb. Sir R. Clive refused to discuss thio, as His Majesty f s Government could not give Persia an island which did not belong to Great Britain, and the Sheikh who owned Tamb declined to part with it. Teymourtache subsequently changed his ground, saying that Persia would be content with a long lease of Tamb, for which rent could be paid to the Sheikh, who could at the same time keep his garrison on the island and would be exempt from customs duties. Sir R.Clive said he could not discuss this proposal. It would in any case take several months to negotiate, even if the Sheikh were prepared to discuss it. Teymourtache nevertheless Indicated that a long lease of Tamb was one of the conditions under which alone he would be prepared to contemplate a treaty. 4. 'vi-WV4. In a final conversation with the Minister of Court w* Oct ober 28, the question was again discussed. There is a discrepancy in Sir H.Clive's telegram and his despatch reporting what passed at this conversation, m the telegram he says that Teymourtache offered to lease Tamb and Abu Musa for 50 years, paying over to the Sheikh whatever we paid for the lease of Hen jam. The despatch seems to contemplate the lease of Tamb alone, and not of Abu Musa. The relevant extract from the despatch runs as follows n He then spoke at length about the necessity of n saving Persia^ face over Bahrein. I asked him if he ”had read the memorandum which I had sent to Feroughi in a personal letter a few days ago which set out the whole pos ition in regard to Sirri, Tamb and bu Musa; he said ”he had and I repeated again that His Majesty’s Government f ’could not, and would not, force an Arab Sheikh to part ’’with his property against his will and he must admit that 'it was unreasonable for him to ask us to do so. He then ’’reverted to the proposition which he had made at our last ’’interview that the Sheikh should lease the island and ”finally, in the presence of the Minister for Foreign ’’Affairs, he said that if the Sheikh would lease the ”i&amp;land for fifty years the Persian Government would pay H to him whatever rental they received from us for Hen jam; ’’this, he said, would satisfy the Persian public when the ’’Treaty came up before the Majlis. He declined to ’’believe that His Majesty’s Government could not Induce ’’an Arab Sheikh however obstinate to accept some such ’’fair and reasonable arrangement. In his opinion this ’’should certainly be less difficult than persuading the M House of Commons to forego the debt when the Treaty ”cam© up for ratification.”5. It is clearly necessary to examine the feasibility of the Persian proposals, as indicated above, for the lease of Tamb. if feasible, they appear to represent a solution of one of the most difficult points connected with the treaty negotiations. Moreover, it is a solution which His Majesty’s Government might possibly be able to turn to their own advantage. It should be possible, when negotiating with the Persian Government the details of a lease of famb, to connect the question very closely with the negotiations regarding the lease of a part of Hen jam. If the Persian Government, for example, want to lease Tamb for fifty years, it will be difficult for them to refuse to lease us a part of Hen jam for fifty years, which they have hitherto refused to do on the ground that fifty years Is too long a period for any such lease. Moreover, if the Persians try, as they are trying, to impose unnecessarily onerous restrictions and conditions on us at Hen jam, we shall perhaps be able to induce a more reasonable attitude toy proposing to Include the same restrictions and conditions In the lease of Tamb. 6. But before we can further consider this suggestion, we must ascertain (a) Whether the Sheikh of Has el Khalm&amp;h would in principle be willing to lease Tamb to Persia for, say, fifty years. (b) Whether the Persians, In return for the lease, are definitely prepared to agree not only to abandon their claim to Abu Musa, but also to recognise the sovereignty of the Sheikh of Has el Kb&amp;imah over Tamb. Whether in fact they would be prepared to agree to an article in the lease on the lines of Article 1 of the ‘Henjam Protocol', e.g. n The 'Sheikh of Ras el Khainah consents to grant to the Persian 'Government a lease of his island of Tamb'.\ 7* It seems preferable to approach tli© Sheikh. of Has ©1 Khaimah as in (a ) above before approaching the Persian Government as in (b). The Sheikh of Ras el Khaimah may quite possibly refuse to lease the island, and it would be well to as certain his attitude before giving the Persian Government reason to hope that something may come of their suggestion* (Signed) C.W*Baxter* 14th November, 1930,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOYERNMEHT. auuospnere naa changed and that little progress had been made. I interrupted i ^ la( ^ — a( ^ ^ e - ^ m P ress i on myself on the occasion of my recent audience 'with the bhah that His Majesty appeared to be quite indifferent as to whether we made a treaty or not, and that he had made, what seemed to me, an extraordinary statement when he had said that he was unaware whether His Majesty’s Government wished to see Persia weak or strong. Teymourtache assured me that His Majesty was not indifferent to the treaty, but he was unable to give me any satisfactory explanation of His Majesty s remark. I said that His Majesty’s Government felt, and, in my opinion, rightly felt, that the Persian Government had shown little or no appreciation of the various concessions we had made and of the very generous desire on our part, of which we had given ample proof, to dissipate in the interests of future good relations all possible causes of dispute or misunderstanding. I referred, in this connexion, to my letter to Feroughi of the 1 st October, in which we had not only accepted the Persian counter-proposal about the Duzdap Railway as a basis of settlement of this question at a probable annual cost of several thousand pounds to the Government of India, but, in deference to their wishes, we had consented to remove the residency from Bushire, which would again entail the Government of India in the expenditure of many thousands of pounds, while, in regard to the question of telegraphs, His Majesty’s Government had decided to remove the department from Persia, subject to certain minor conditions in the south, and to forgo claims which, on the basis of Mr. New’s memorandum, of which he had a copy, amounted to some £150,000. 3. His Highness said he readily admitted the generosity of His Majesty’s Government in these matters, and it was quite untrue that the Persian Government did not appreciate it, but he hoped I would still try to represent to my Government the difficulties of his own. From the Persian point of view Bahrein was the crux of the whole matter, and though we had agreed that in the treaty there should be nothing to indicate that one point was a definite set-off against some other point, yet in fact he considered that His Majesty’s Government had, in order to clear up the future position of Bahrein, agreed in principle to make various concessions. I said it was all very well for him to insist on the Persian point of view about Bahrein, but he must remember that we denied altogether the justification of the Persian claim to Bahrein. The concessions that we were making were very largely voluntary concessions in order to clear up any possible sources of future friction. The only tangible thing we were getting out of this treaty was the Hen jam Protocol to regularise a position which had existed for some twenty-five years, and yet in the Hen jam Protocol there were a number of points which were quite unsatisfactory; why, for instance, did the Persians still want to keep an unnecessarily large number of police and a military force? Why could not His Majesty’s Government, as a lessee of a small part of the island, be free to do what they wanted in the small area for which they were paying a rent ? Why did the Persians wish to confine us to the use of the wireless for communication with British warships only? There might often be occasions when it would be necessary to communicate with His Majesty’s flying boats in the Gulf, or with merchant ships. His Highness said that, personally, he had no objection to the wireless station receiving messages from the flying boats or from merchant ships, provided that the wireless was not used for commercial purposes. I said there was no question of this; what we objected to were the PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL [F 6027/143/34] i I November 6 , 1930. Section 1. Sir R. Clive to Mr. A. Bender son.—{Received November 6 .)

I then mentioned visits of our warships to Persian ports, and said you had been very surprised to learn that his Highness appeared to have gone on fy® proposals which had in principle been more or less agreed to. He said that he could not accept the draft exchange of notes suggested, but he was prepared to authorise local Governors in urgent cases to allow the visit of ships duly notified v ut i* 0 foi» 6 iic 6 Tehran. 5 He then spoke at length about the necessity of saving Persia’s face over £ Bahrein. I asked him if he had read the memorandum which I had sent to Feroughi in a personal letter a few days ago which set out the whole position in regard to Sirri, Tamb and Abu Musa/; he said he had, and I repeated again that His Majesty’s i Government could not, and would not, force an Arab sheikh to part with his property against his will, and he must admit that it was unreasonable for him to ask us to do so. He then reverted to the proposition which he had made at our last interview, that the sheikh should lease the island, and finally, in the presence of the Minister x for Foreign Affairs, he said that if the sheikh would lease the island for fifty years, the Persian Government would pay to him whatever rental they received from us for Henjam. This, he said, would'satisfy the Persian public when the treaty came up before the Majlis. He declined to believe that His Majesty’s Government could not induce an Arab sheikh, however obstinate, to accept some such fair and reasonable arrangement. In his opinion, this should certainly be less difficult than persuading the House of Commons to forgo the debt when the treaty came up for ratification. 6 . He then reverted to the question of double income-tax. I again said that this did not appear to His Majesty’s Government to have any connexion with the treaty; that Persia had only had income-tax since March, and had never raised the £ question officially. His Majesty’s Government had not refused to discuss it, but they considered that to drag in at the last moment a new question which could 1 normally be treated through the diplomatic channel, was absurd. If we continued to do this there would be no end to the treaty; I might just as well insist on a j satisfactory settlement of the diplomatic and consular bags being brought into the treaty. We then discussed for some time this latter question, about which I am reporting separately. 7. Once more he returned to double income tax, and said it was a question of ^ great importance to the Persian Government, and he only wanted His Majesty's Government to declare their willingness to discuss it in connexion with the treaty. Persia could then feel that there was no outstanding question of importance at issue between the two Governments. Finally, he said that he wished me to assure you that the Persian Government really desired to make this treaty, and that he hoped very much that when I was on leave I would explain the Persian position, and that he was quite prepared to continue negotiations by correspondence between himself and me whilst I was on leave with a view to getting the position more or less cleared up before I returned. I gave him no promise about this, and said I would report to you what he had said. In conclusion, I would say that the atmosphere at the luncheon party was extremely friendly. It was, I suppose, a compliment to His Majesty’s Legation for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to invite myself and the whole staff to meet the Minister of Court and the whole Cabinet. Teymourtache, who had evidently been rather taken back by my letter about the articles in the newspapers, became much more friendly as the afternoon progressed, and ended by assuring me that Persia could have no interest in changing the status quo and upsetting our friendly relations while I was on leave, and they were still hoping to get the treaty settled. 8 . lam sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Govern ment of India, His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq, and to His Majesty's consul-general at Bushire.

I called on Minister of Court by appointment yesterday and had two hours conversation. I told him as I had told Minister for Foreign Affairs (see my telegram No, 238) that Persia must drop claim to the three islands in the Gulf if we were to make treaty of which I added the only tangible advantage oo us was to regularise position at Henjsm. His Highness argued that if Persia renounced claim to Bahrein public opinion required some territorial I compensation. He would drop claim to Bumusa if Persia had Tamb, I said that it was useless to discuss thjs as His Majesty's Government could not give Persia an island which did not belong to Great Britain and the Sheikh who owned the island declined to part with it. His Highness then turned off to double income tax, I repeated that this had nothing to do with treaty. He argued that it was an outstanding question. I said it was nothing of the kind. Persia had only had an income tax since March and had not since then officially raised the question. He asked if His Majesty's Government would not exchange notes to be4 ? —' ; 2 . Bigncd witn treaty agreeing to discuss the subject I it was clear to me that His Highness could not '' &amp;nt a treaty th;l8 autvaan otherwise he would not Persist in claim to lamb and raise an entirely new question at last moment. I realised therefore that our negotiations had broken down. He then shifted his groan.,. He sale. Persia would be content with long lease of Tamb for which rent could be paid to the Sheikh who could at the same time keep his garrison* on the island and would be exempted from custom duties. I said I could not discuss this proposal, it would in any case take several months to negotiate even if Sheikh was prepared to discuss It. I added that if Tamb was the only obstacle to treaty it seemed very short sighted on his part. He then spoke of war debt and asked for remission of remainder and as regards man-of-war said that Persian government could only agreo to visit by notification In the case of Abadan. To these conditions he added long lease of Tamb and exchange of notes about double income tax, I said it was regrettable to me and very discouraging after two years efiorts to find him adopting this attitude and I could only inform my government that our negotiations had broken down. I feared that your impi oSbicn woulo. be meat he was playing the same game as Egyptians last spring in discarding advantageous Ox Oat'-V introducing last minute proposals and by his intransigeant attitude over Tamb. 1 said I was leaving3. leaving at the end of the month hut should like to ask him a question. Were we to expect after my departure a policy of obstruction,pin pricks, and creation of petty incidents or was Persian government going to maintain reasonable and friendly relations? In reply he took strong objection to Egyptian analogy and tried to minimise concessions we were making. He added that he did not consider negotia tions as broken down but only postponed. I said if a statement was published showing state of our negotiations to-day I was convinced that the whole British press without exception would testify to the generosity of His Majesty’s Government and a section would say that we had been much too generous. His Highness then said that the Shall only wished best relations with His Majesty's Government and would doubtless say so when I was received in audience. Interview remained correct end friendly through out. I propose to leave about October 28th. Shah has influenza and will not start on his autumn tour before October 24th.

At interview with Minister for Foreign Affairs toch^ r 1 told His Highness that if we were to. make a treaty Persia must renounce her claims to Bahrein and to the Islands of Iamb and Bumusa. Our attitude on this point- had been finally and definitely made clear in memorandum of September 11th. in order however to show good will of my governmer end their desire to go as far as possible to meet the wishes of the Persian Government and in the words of the Minister of Court to liquidate the past I enumerated three further concessions which His Majesty's Government were prepared to make. 1. To proceed at once to liQurdation of Inno European Telegraph Department in very generous terms. 2. To accept probable counter proposals suoject to certain reservations an a* basis i or settling quo sir 0^^. Om Dusd ap rail way. 3. To remove 'Residency from Bushire as soon as provision could oe made for accommodation oi nooicie^ic.- elsewhere. These far reaching concessions would not only involve His Majesty’s Government in considerable fin ancial sacrifice but were an outstanding proof of theii desire to remove the last traces of anything which nu-gnt*i \ \ 'i i) te held to oe an infringement of Persian sovereign, ri^its* As object of treaty was to settle all outstanding questions I trusted that Persian Government when they had considered these further concessions would drop claim to the three Islands. Minister for Foreign Affairs was very guarded* He suggested omitting from treaty all mention of the Islands . I said this was impossible and he promised to report what I had said to his colleagues. I warned him that if they persisted in this attitude there was no chance of making a treaty and I again emphasised the great generosity of these concessions. He then handed me letter in reply to memorandum of September 11th* I mention the following points. (A) Regarding telegraphs he says he is sure His Majesty’s Government will not Impose on Persia conditions of a convention whose validity might be questioned. (B) Debt. After reviewing position he states Persia feels justified in again begging His Majesty’s Government to cancel remainder of war debt. (G) He agrees to claims article which should provide for reciprocal engagement to meet claims of the other party, manner in which they are to be verified, and method of payment* (D) He will only agree to visit of warships by noti fication i/O Abadan in order to fuel ’’for fear o. cieating precedent with other powers'. (E) Note maintains attitude already adopted about Tamb and Bumusa (this of course was written prior to my c onv er sat i on t oday). (F) Regarding Bahrein he proposes either to con sider Bahrein as an independent sovereign state in watch case/3. case as he points out a treaty article would !e out of the Question or to submit Question to arbitration or to come to terms on basis already put forward. (G) He agrees to enumeration of treaties and to publication of all notes exchanged. He. then enumerates these treaties etc. ('irrespective of degree of their validity') and mentions 1920 agreement but not treaty of 1341. He told me he had never heard of treaty of 1841. (H) He asks for a special article about double income tax. On this latter point I told him we would not agree. 'Question had nothing to do with this treaty and could be settled apart.

Your telegram No. 9o (of April 16th) and despatch No. 169 (of April 18th. Anglo-Persian negotiations). His Majesty’s Government would he most reluctant that negotiations should break down over the question of Tamb. The possibility, however, of a compromise solution depends entirely upon the 8heikh of Ras-el-Khaimah's readiness to sell. Last September the Political Resident reported that he did not think the Sheikh would accept any sum of iuoney that Persia was likely to offer, and if the Sheikh were absolutely to refuse to sell at any price, His Majesty’s Government obviously could not bring pressure on nim oo do so. The only possible course of action then would be to tell Persia that the renunciation of her claim is an absolute condition of any settlement with us. ror the present it is important to discourage the idea in the mind of the Minister of Court that the island can somehow or other be secured for Persia. We cannot even hint at the possibility of a deal unless and until we Lear u.nao the Sheikh is willing to sell. Government of India are being requested to arrange for Sheikh's attitude on this point to be ascertained, but this is for your own information only and not for conmmication to Persian Government. You « • •( 2 ). 1 V i You should continue to negotiate with Minister c£ Court on the lines of ny immediately following telegram and strongly urge him to reconsider his uncompromising attitude, v;hich, if persisted in, would make a friendly settlement between our two countries impossible ?he whole idea of a general settlement implies a readiness on each side to make concessions which neither would be pre pared to make except as part of the general settlement. It is not really asking much of Persia to recognise the st atus, duo, in the Gulf and to admit the rights of her neighbours to their own possessions. Even if the Sheikh is ready to sell, the tentative proposals in paragraph 7 of your despatch would not in themselves be satisfactory. They mean that His Majesty’s Government should themselves buy the island from the Sheikh and present it to Persia in return for the promise of facilities at Henjam. The one advantage of paying a substantial rent for our privileges at Henjam is to provide Persia with a financial inducement for keeping to the Henjam Protocol in the spirit as well as in the letter. If the rent had to be paid to the Sheikh instead of to the Persian Government, our position at Henjam would be by so much the more precarious. If by any chance sale can be arranged, I trust it may prove possible to devise some solution by which Persia .actually pays for the island and Henjam rent is not hypothecated. For example there might be a treaty article by which Persian Government would undertake to pay to the Sheikh a sum of money for his claim, and would agree that he should remain in possession of the island until this sum had actually been paid. As ...\ \ (3). V As regards general negotiations it seems to te a mistake to allow the minister of Court purposely to delay discussion on the draft Jheniera Protocol. This document raises the most complicated issues and x x oiu Oil e point of view of His Majesty’s Government* it would he a pity to leave it for a hurried and possibly unsatisfactory last- minute settlement. It is important, moreover, to know exactly where we stand as regards Hen jam. and what con cessions the Persian Government would he prepared to make. In general, the course of your negotiations hitherto has been disappointing as regards the results obtained, despite all your unceasing efforts to bring the Minister of the Court to reason. His Highness seems to have settled down to the one-sided policy of extracting the promise of concession after concession from us, but of promising absolutely nothing in return. This cannot go on indefinite ly, and for the present it would seem well to maintain a firm front, explaining to the Minister of Court that there can be no question of further concessions on our part and pointing out that the concessions already offered con ditionally on a satisfactory general settlement being reached are imperilled unless the Persians show a disposition to meet our reasonable requirements. As regards the debt, you should make it clear that the offer of His Majesty’s Government to remit the £1,000,000 of the agreed debt, or indeed any part of the war debt, is conditional upon a satisfactory settlement of outstanding questions, and therefore nre-supposes the abandonment of the Persian claims to Tomb as well as to Abu Musa and Bahrein* As regards the last £510,000 of the war debt, the instructions in my telegram No. 75 (of April 3th) still stand. Decision to purchase Persian navy in Italy has altered situation, and I shall need to consult Treasury and India Office afresh before any concession is made as regards this sum* Repeated to India No. 23.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00010f_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3709</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00010f</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3709</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/1 'Tamb Island: Question of Lease to Persia, Persian Govt's Claim to Tamb'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1930/1935</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-09-27T23:48:24</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (437 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 439; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
