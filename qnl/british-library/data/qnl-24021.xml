Sir, I have to inform you that the Air Ministry have now sanctioned the purchase of the old quarantine Station from the Bahrein State, and I should be greatly obliged therefore if you would instruct the Political Agent'Bahrein to carry out the negotiations for its purchase'on behalf of the Ministry. A tentative purchase price of Rs 12,000/- has been mentioned in correspondence, but in view of the condition of the buildings it is thought that an appreciable reduction in this figure might be obtained. In view of the great desirability of effecting an early purchase to enable the necessary work of reconditioning to be put in hand at an early date, I'should be grateful if you would authorise the Political Agent to cable direct to this office the final figure as agreed between himself and the Government of Bahrein. I trust that you will raise no objection to his acting as our Agent in the execution of the necessary Deed of conveyance. It is also requested that information may be given as to whether the cost of execution will fall on the purchaser or seller under the Laws of the State of Bahrein, and if the former, what that cost cost will be.

This clause should include our option of renewal. This could be done by adding at the end ?? 7frth the option of renewal -at the same yearly rental in 5 yearly periods at the end of the lease. The H.A.F. should declare their intention of exercising this option not later than 1 year before the expiry of the lease. n Clause 2, Dates can be decided when the other clauses are agreed to. Suggest April 1st, 1930. Hemainder of clause agreed. Clause 3. The rent at £ 120 will be accepted; but the Air Ministry as a Government Department cannot be expected to pay in advance as if it were a private concern seeking a concession. Payment could be made half yearly or yearly in arrears. Clause 4. Cannot possibly be agreed to. The first portion should read n The R.A.F. have the right to erect any necessary buildings, masts etc., that they shall require for the purpose of a Landing ground. At the expiry of the lease, the E.A.F. shall be liable to restore the ground to its original condition and to remove all buildings thereon. Should r 38?

The price to be paid shall be on a mutually agreed valuation, failing which the R.A.F. shall have the right to dispose of the buildings as they please.” The second portion should form a new Clause-5-* and should read as follows ”The B.A.F. agree that the aerodrome will be available for use by Imperial Airways. The question of payment by Imperial Airways for the use of the aerodrome, if any, shall be a matter of arrangement direct between the Air Ministry and Imperial Airways, and shall be no concern of the State of Bahrain. Permission for the use of the aerodrome by machines other than those of Imperial Airways shall be a matter of mutual agreement between the R.A.F. and the Shaikh.” Clause 5. (now clause 6). re-word as follows:- ”The Shaikh will undertake to preserve all G-overnment property immediately adjoining the aerodrome boundaries free from buildings or cultivation which would be liable to cause obstruction to low flying machines. In the event of any buildings being put up on the G-overnment property the plans will be submitted for the prior approval of R.A.F. Clause 6. now included in clause 1. There appears to be no reason for contemplating an increase in the annual rental. Clause 7. Agreed.

M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. .M Sir, In reference to your No.1017-21/4 of the 21st June, 1934, I have the honour to report that on 26th June, 1934, s.s^Barpeta' arrived in port, and that Captain N. Wilson duly came ashore, and met the State Engineer and myself. 2. The Aerodrome at Gadhibiah was duly inspected, and regarded as suitable for the landing of Wapiti machines. It was decided that the work of watering and rolling the strip should be proceeded with and be repeated every three months. 3. The Bill of Cost for the previous experimental work on this strip of land is enclosed herewith for favour of submission for payment by The Chief Engineer, Air Headquarters, Hinaidi, Baghdad. 4. It was arranged that certain small hummocks on the aerodrome should be flattehS out by The State Engineer, Bahrain, at the cost of The Chief Engineer, Air Headquarter Baghdad. 5. It was arranged that the aerodrome should be watered andd rolled by The State Engineer, Bahrain, every three months, for nine months. ^ As the cost of watering, apart from the cost of rolling etc., is likely to,vary, it is impossible for The Government of Banrain to quote a firm estimate of the cost of such watering and rolling. Therefore at the conclu sion of each three-monthly operation, The Government of Bahrain will submit for payment a Bill to The Chief Engineer, Air Headquarters, Baghdad, which Bill will be based upon the actual cost of the operation to the State, including, of course, overhead charges. 6. After these three three-monthly operations have been completed, the Landing Gcound is to be inspected with Wapitis, to ascertain whether such operationoperation should be carried out more or less frequently. Also, the Government of Bahrain^should then be able to quoteto the Chief Engineer a firm estimate for the repetition^of this work. And also, the possibility is to be considered of effecting better results by oiling the surface with crude oil. 7. The operations are to be regarded as carried out by The Government of Bahrain as agency service on behalf of the Chief Engineer, Air Headquarters, Baghdad. 8. I have to ask, please, if you will kindly commu- nicatethe above tothe Chief Engineer. Air Headquarters, Hinaidi, Baghdad, with the enclosed Bill of Cost.

Aerodrome, Godhabiah, and 2. the threemonthly watering and rolling of the Aerodrome, I enclose herewith for your information a copy of the State Engineer’s report on progress received today, from which it will be seen that the work is delayed by a breakdown of the motor road-roller, in case you may consider it advisable to mention . this to the Chief Engineer. The work will be resumed after the necessary repairs have been effected. For Adviser to the Government.£ )(t $ $ $ a|( Jit Copy of Memorandum No. A.C.B. ll/53, dated, 23rd August, 1934 (12th J/Awal, 1353) from The State Engineer, Bahrain, to The Adviser to The Govern ment of Bahrain. Subject:- Clearing, Watering and Rolling R.A.F., Landing Ground, Manama. The work of clearing the ground of little mounds and filling in cavities has been finished. Three watering carts were fitted up and a certain amount of watering done. Rolling of the ground was carried out inter mittently for about six days, but owing to the condition of the engine which failed to pull its weight through the soft patches, all the work has now been stopped pending receipt of spares whcj^h are on order. The principal defect is a crack in the cylinder block which runs through one of the exhaust ports into the water space of the jacket. The old piston rings still required replacing; the carburetter ?/as out of adjustment and several new parts were made and fitted, a new spindle was made locally and fitted to the fan and the engine in other respects was overhauled.

URGENT. 3 r/ No. /6. Dated, S’/S’' J/Awwal, 1358. June, 1939. Bahrain. Memorandum: Complaints have been made to the Bahrain Government by the Muharraq municipal council and residents of Hedd about the work of the R.A.F. in Muharraq. The R.A.F. were given permission to build a wall along the shore of Muharraq bay. It now appears that a wall is being constucted from the south corner of the bay in a north east direction towards Galali. This should not have been done without permission from the Bahrain Government. The wall blocks the motor route to Hedd, and also, in my opinion, will be likely to cause the sea to flood the low ground on the shore at the corner of the bay as the wall round the bay does not appear to succeed in keeping out the water. The land in question is Government property and the R.A.F. have no right to construct walls , upon it. . jc v * It also appears that digging has been done beyond the road towards Galali. Will you please request the R.A.F. to cease work on this wall. I enclose a map and a note from Superintendent, Land Department who visited the site today. I should be obliged if you would return the map. ^ Advis er to Bahrain Government.i I References rxcx • GW/BN/3/17 Air Ministry Directorate of Works. Bahrain, the 3rd July, 1939. H.B.M’s Political Agent Bahrain. Sea Wall - Moharraq Island Sir Attached drawing of Moharraq Island showing the area subject to flooding during spring tides. It was originally intended to stop the wall on the high ground North of Arad Village but as flooding occurs from the south east coast as shown, from Ziiama Bay and from north east of Hidd Village, the wall was taken in a line towards the high ground of Galali. Village. To make the wall effective on the original line it would be necessary to build the wall down along the south east coast and back up to the high ground of Ofalali which would necessitate the construction of approximately a further 2 miles of wall. The possibility of increase flood owing to the wall being diverted from the original line is considered highly impossible as the water of Zimina Bay and the sea join above Hidd Village during high floods. It is intended to build high level road crossing over the top of the diverted wall where the car tracks are, and to mark intervening wall with suitable black and white painted strips, so that it c an easily be distinguished by traffic at nig^it times. When it was decided to divert the w all^ the question of firstly obtaining your permission was overlooked, this error is deeply regretted. yours obediently. V ^ ^ Works Officer, A.M.W.D., Bahrain. Att ache d;- DrawingD.O.No. 1113-21/4 The 5th July 1939 ’/ill you please refer to your memorandum No. 381 dated the 26th June 1939 on the subject of the dwarf wall being constructed in Moharraq by the Royal Air Force. As you know I had the unauthorised work stopped at once and X am writing a strong protest to the Air Officer Commanding complaining of the action taken by the Works Department without authority. Meanwhile X have had the flooding question under examination, and X enclose herewith a copy of a memorandum and a sketch map prepared by the local /orks Officer. The sketch is, I fear, on a very small scale, but it serves to explain that the original plan for the sea-wall was totally ineffective since it did not provide protection against flooding from the bay called 'Zimma Bay’* or from the coast on the north east of Hedd. It follows that if the project is to be of any value at all, it is inevitable that a wall be built in a N.E. direction from the N.E. corner of Muharrsk Bay as far as the high ground S.W. of Galali. From the fact of the situation it does not appear that this will cause the least, danger of flooding in either Aradh or Hedd; and provided that proper ramps of a reasonable width can be built to enable cars and other traffic to cross the wall. I hope the Bahrain Government will be good enough to agree to the new piece of wall being constructed. I suggest that the Superintendent^Land Department^should get into touch with Mr. Murray, the Works Officer in Bahrain, ascertain the exact alignment and length of the proposed C.

I understand that the A.L.O, is away and a little difficulty has arisen over the alignment of the dwarf Wall on Mohurraq Island. 2. It appears that we have not requested permis sion to alter this alignment in order to prevent ingress of water at high tide, and in the meantime the work has been carried out. 3, I would be glad if you would apologise to the Bahrein Government, if we have not carried out the correct procedure. 4, To prevent ingress of water it v^ould be necessary to extent the wall another 2 miles unless permission is granted to build it round up to the higher ground, as has been done. Arrangements can easily be made for a ramp up to and over the wall to suit motor vehicles - the point of this ramp to be marked by marking posts. 5, I shall be glad if you would take the matter up and effect an amicable settlement with the Bahrein Government as it was not intended in any way to go against their wishes.From:- Works Officer, A.M.W.D., Bahrain.

Dwarf Se a Wall - Moha rraq Sir, May permission please be granted for this department to complete the remaining small amount of work on the diverted part of the above. I have been in consultation with the Government Superin tendent of Land Department yesterday and the question of increased flooding and the possibility of scouring taken place has been ruled out, as from observations kept on the site during the recent high spring tides. It was learnt that no alteration in the flow of the flood water nor Increase of floods was experienced. Road crossings over the top of the wall have been laid down to the satisfaction of the Bahrain Government Land Deptt: and. ot?aer outstanding questions cleared up. During the recent floods the wall proved extremely satisfactory having kept hack the high floods from ground usually flooded. The remaining portion of the wall that has still to be completed was above the level of the high tide, and if permission can kindly be granted to complete this portion, it will stop the next higher floods in approximately a week’s time from flooding in behind the wall aid thereby setting us the problem of getting the areas so flooded drained again.

No.1113-21/4. dated the 5th July 1939, about the wall which is being constructed in Muharraq by the H*A.F. 2. I have discussed the matter with Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Salman and also with Khan Saheb Mohammad Khalil, Superintendent^ of the Land Department. 3. The Bahrain Grovernment* will withdraw its objection to the construction of a wall, going Eastward in the direction of Galali from A to C, provided that:- a. The wall around M Muharraq Bay” is continued to the point D on the enclosed map, which was the point which the wall was originally intended to reach. b. There should be at least two ramps in the wall going Eastwards suitable for motor traffic to cross the wall. 4. In our opinion if the wall around the bay terminated at A water from the bay would enter between A and D, where there is very low land, and would be likely to cause a permanently swampy area alongside the wall A-B, or alongside mr much of this area between the shore and the higher ground. 5. We think that there is a possibility, if the wall round 'Muharraq Bay' is effective, of the water in Zimma Bay^ncreasing which may possibly necessitate the con struction of a similar wall, by the Bahrain Government, from eastern edge of Arad to Zimma garden. The land from Zimma Bay to the north coast is in most places very low. Adviser to the Government of Bahrain.No. 1315-21/4 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 26th July 1939.
