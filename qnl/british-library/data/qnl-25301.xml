Babington-Smith to Foreign Office.—(Received March 17.) National Bank of Turkey, 50, Cornhill, London, Sir, March 16, 1914. IN accordance with the request conveyed in Sir Eyre Crowe’s telegram of the 14th instant, with reference to the question of petroleum in Mesopotamia, I have the honour to state in writing the proposals which I explained to him verbally on the 12th instant. The Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company agrees to give to Mr. Gulbenkian a sub- participation of 2|- per cent., without voting rights, out of the 25 per cent, which that company holds in the capital of the Turkish Petroleum Company. Mr. Gulbenkian will be satisfied if, in addition to this 2J per cent., he is given a sub-participation of 2^ per cent, in the share of 50 per cent, which, in accordance with the wish of His Majesty’s Government, would be assigned to Mr. d’Arcy’s group. The shares representing this 2^ per cent, would stand, not in Mr. Gulbenkian’s name, but in the name of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, or whatever other name represents the d’Arcy group, and the votes attaching to them would be exercised for all purposes by that group. Mr. Gulbenkian will sign any document that may be deemed necessary to remove any doubt on this point, and, further, he will enter into a binding engage ment that this interest should not be transferred to anyone else without first being offered on defined terms to the d’Arcy group. As an example of a method by which the price may be defined, I may refer to the article of the statutes of the Turkish Petroleum Company which deals with this point. This arrangement would secure to the d’Arcy group complete and permanent control of 50 per cent, of the share capital if, as I assume is the case, His Majesty’s Government have taken measures to ensure that the shares held by that group at the outset shall continue to be held by it permanently. Mr. Gulbenkian would have a financial interest, amounting to 5 per cent, in all, in the business, but he would have no voting rights of any kind. As regards the procedure to be followed, the shares in the Turkish Petroleum Company held in the name of the National Bank of Turkey (50 per cent, of the whole) might be transferred half to the Deutsche Bank and half to the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company, and then transferred afresh to the d’Arcy group. This was the procediire originally suggested by the Deutsche Bank. As an alternative, the shares might, with the concurrence of the Deutsche Bank and the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company, be transferred direct to the d’Arcy group. So far as the National Bank of Turkey is concerned, either procedure might be adopted. The question would arise whether the partnership thus to be established between the d’Arcy group, the Deutsche Bank, and the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company should apply to the whole of Turkey (as does the Turkish Petroleum Company) or should be limited to Mesopotamia, the region to which the attention of the d’Arcy group has been directed. But once the question of principle decided, this matter could be settled without difficulty between the parties concerned. If there are any other points on which you would desire to have further informa tion or explanation, I beg to hold myself entirely at your disposal. I am, &amp;c. H.

Memorandum by Mr. Ashley.—(Received at Foreign Office, March 18.) Mesopotamian Oil. IN accordance with Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith’s instruction, I have this morning had an interview with Dr. Bergmann, representing the Deutsche Bank. He was accompanied by Herr von Kuhlmann. Dr. Bergmann was acquainted with the outline of Sir Henry Babington-Smith’s latest proposal. He said that, whilst the Deutsche Bank would naturally prefer a deal with the British group, whereby each would have a 50 per cent, interest, they felt that it w^ould be difficult for them to take such a course. In the first place, they are under certain definite obligations in connection with the Turkish Petroleum Company, and independent action by them might, and very probably would, give rise to litigation, which they were anxious to avoid. In the second place, there are business relations between the Deutsche Bank and the Anglo-Saxon Company in other fields, and the Deutsche Bank for that reason desire that the settlement reached should be as amicable as possible. The Deutsche Bank therefore do not object to a settlement on the basis now suggested by Sir Henry Babington-Smith, and Dr. Bergmann is of opinion that it offers a solution which should be satisfactory to the d’Arcy group. I said that I was not in a position to say what the decision of the d’Arcy group would be, but, speaking only for myself, it seemed that there was a fair prospect of a settlement. It was suggested that if the d’Arcy group were favourably inclined to Sir Henry Babington-Smith’s proposal, a meeting of all the parties might be held, say, to-morrow, at which a record of the arrangement could be drawn up and signed by the various parties. _ This would give the British and German Governments an adequate basis for action at Constantinople, and the formal details could be settled subsequently. Herr Stauss, the oil company expert of the Deutsche Bank, would be available early next week. In view of the attitude of the Deutsche Bank and the apparently genuine nature of the offer made by Sir Henry Babington-Smith, I venture to suggest that an effort should be made to induce the d’Arcy group to accept the scheme. It appears to give them all that they really want, or at least as much as they can reasonably expect— 50 per cent, of the control. I suggest that, if they do acquiesce, a meeting of all the parties proposed above should be held at the Board of Trade or at the Foreign Office, and that it should be clearly understood that the purpose of the meeting would be to record a decision and not to discuss any principles.

WE are advised by our agent at Constantinople that he has drawn the attention of His Majesty’s Ambassador at that place to a report that a group of influential Turkish capitalists, including le Marechal Gazi Moukhtar Pasha (father of Mahmoud Moukhtar, now Turkish Ambassador in Berlin and formerly member of the Turkish Cabinet), are taking active steps to secure the concession for the exploitation of the oil territories in Mosul, Bagdad, and Basra. In connection with this, I beg to advise that I have received this morning a telegram from the same source advising that a company has been definitely formed for the above purpose. Our agent, in a letter received yesterday, suggests that this group is endeavouring to secure the concession on the basis of information obtained from Berlin as to the negotiations proceeding between the British and German Governments with a view r to reselling it either to the Deutsche Bank group or to the proposed joint group. He adds that, however desirous the Sublime Porte may be to carry out their engagements and promises, he believes that Halil Bey and Djemal Pasha, who are doubtless supporting the Moukhtar group, could bring such weight to bear on their Government as to compel it to go back upon what Hakki Pasha has done in London. We hardly think this can be possible, but we place the information received before you, in order that you may take such steps as you may think to be required by the situation. I have, &amp;c. C.

Formalities for transfer of oil licences to Boxall, Suleiman Nasif, have been completed at Damascus, and official applications for concession of the oilfields were lodged with Mining Department here on 4th instant. Suleiman and Dr. Schumacher hold licences for oilfields outside, but in proximity to those in which Boxall is interested, and although these have been offered to him, he has not been able, I believe, for financial reasons, to take them up. Both Schumacher and Suleiman are very anxious to put these properties in the hands o£ British capitalists rather than negotiate wdth others. I think it most important in the interests of concessions already applied for that w r e should endeavour to secure these holdings, and I would therefore urge, in view of Lord Cowdray’s letter to you of 10th December, 1913, that opportunity may be taken of suggesting his co-operation with Boxall in acquisition and working of all the Syrian oilfields in which Boxall and his friends are interested. My impression is that Boxall would agree. Standard Oil Company have secured options on twenty-three properties situated on east and w T est of the Dead Sea, licences for which are held by two notables and Suleiman. Latter regrets having negotiated with the company, but, having failed to induce Rushton or Anglo-Persian to take them up and Boxall not being able to, he had no other course. Matters have advanced so far that he is leaving to-day for New York to discuss details of the contract with Standard directors. Standard Oil are at present very active and eager to take up any available properties, and have offered to take over all Boxall’s holdings, which he has refused. 2067 &lt; 7 — 4 ][Tims Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.}. 1 1 TURKEY. ——~ ■# r*~ r &amp; % * &gt;i 4.. ,s '~:*r * j 0 ^ [March 4.]'' CONFIDENTIAL.

WITH reference to recent informal communications which have taken place between yon and this Department on the subject of the Mesopotamian oil concession, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to inform you, as representing the Turkish Petroleum Company and for the information of the parties interested therein, that the proposal that M. Gulbenkian should retain his interest but that voting power in respect of his shares should be vested in the D’Arcy group is not acceptable to that group, and that it is not one which His Majesty’s Government can properly put pressure upon them to accept. In these circumstances His Majesty’s Government have reached a final decision that a 50 per cent, interest as regards share capital, free of all encumbrance of any kind, must be obtained for the D’Arcy group in the Mesopotamian concession. The matter is one w T hich cannot be longer delayed without grave inconvenience, and, consequently, if the Turkish Petroleum Company cannot see their way to participate in such an arrangement, His Majesty’s Government will feel compelled to take such steps as they may think proper to secure the interests of the D’Arcy group.

Mallet to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 3.) (No. 79.) (Telegraphic.) R. Constantinople, February 2, 1914. YOUR despatch No. 55. This despatch only reached me this morning. I have been unable to study it exhaustively in the inadequate time available, but I offer the following observations:— Article 1. Text does not maintain in favour of British subjects any right to apply in the future for concession to extract petroleum in places other than those expressly mentioned. Unless His Majesty’s Government are definitely renouncing this right, which is at present enjoyed by all persons under mining law, it would be advisable to state clearly that, in the case of petroleum, any monopoly to be created will be confined to sale of importation. (2.) I presume that His Majesty’s Government realise that, if concessions are granted to British subjects in places expressly mentioned and a monopoly is subsequently established, British subjects in question will be excluded from all Turkish markets unless they can come to terms with monopolist, who will not be bound to buy from them and who may be himself a rival producer of petroleum. Article 2. I should prefer to omit the word “ directe ” after “ controle.” It is not essential to the Turkish Government’s purpose that control should be direct, and we might find it impossible to elaborate any system satisfactory to ourselves without maintaining measure of consular intervention assured by the Capitulations. We ought not to deprive ourselves beforehand of the right to insist on consular intervention, even though we should allow agents of the Debt to hold inspections under penalty of the law in British places of business. Article 4. This formula does not secure the principle that lighthouses must not be worked at a profit to the Government. If His Majesty’s Government wish this principle to be observed after the expiration of the present concession it will be well to substitute for “ a produire ” “ a produire seulement.” (See my despatch No. 935 of last concession expires in 1924, not in 1919. If it should be agreed to intro duce a new tariff for 1919 the Porte will have difficulties with French concessionnaire, and we ourselves shall probably become involved in these difficulties. Article 7. I understood from your telegram No. 37 of 19th January that Hakki Pasha had agreed to formula contained in my telegram No. 541 of 3rd November, 1913, plus a most-favoured-nation clause. Present text does not ^ achieve same object, because the two Governments are not in agreement as to the privileges assured by existing arrangements to extensions and new institutions. If any hitch should prevent ratification of recent French agreement, new text of Anglo-Turkish declaration will give same scope for controversy as that enclosed in your despatch No. 355 of last year.

Sir: - Wc are advised by our Agent at Constantinople that lie has drawn the attention of Hie Majesty’s Ambassador at that place to a report that a group of Influential Turkish Capitalists, including le Marechal Gaal Moukhtar Pacha (father of Malimoud Moukhtar, now Turkish Ambassador in Berlin and foirnerly member of the Turkish Cabinet) are taking active steps to secure the Concession for the exploitation of the Oil territories in Moussoul, Baghdad and Bussorah. In connection with this I beg to advise that I have received this morning a telegram from the same source advising that a Company has been definitely formed for the above purpose. Our Agent in a letter received yesterday suggests that tliis group is endeavouring to secure The Under Secretary of State, foreign office.secure the concession on the basis of information obtained from Berlin as to the negotiations pro ceeding between the British and German Governments with a view to reselling it either to the Deutsche Bank Group or to the proposed Joint Group. He adds that however desirous the Sublime Porto -my be to carry out their engagements and promises he believes that Halil Bey and Vernal Pacha, who are doubtless supporting the ffoukhtar Group, could bring 81,011 weight to bear on their Government as to compel it to go back upon what Hakki Pacha has done in London.

A tentative discussion took place here to-day with Herr von Kiihlmann about this question, and it was suggested that the simplest course would be for the German and British Governments to inform the Ottoman Government that the Turkish Petroleum Company does not enjoy the support of either Government, and to urge that the concession should be granted to a new company, in which the German interests should have 50 per cent, and the D’Arcy group 50 per cent. The technical difficulty that the Deutsche Bank has undertaken only to act through the Turkish Petroleum Company might be overcome by that bank putting forward^ nominee to participate in the new company, and the Turkish Petroleum Company, being deprived of a sphere of operations, would presumably go into liquidation. You should ascertain the views of the German Government on this proposal, which seems to present a possible solution of a very complicated question.

Minute by Mr. Ashley. — {Communicated by Board of Trade, February 16.) I WAS present yesterday afternoon at an interview between Mr. Parker and Hakki Pasha, at which the question of the oil monopoly was discussed. Hakki Pasha showed us a telegram which he had received from his Government, in which the Turkish Government stated that they attached very great importance to oil-fuel being included within the scope of the proposed monopoly, though they expressed their readiness to take into consideration the requirements of industry and transport in this respect. We pointed out that His Majesty’s Government equally attached great importauce to the exclusion of oil-fuel. Hakki Pasha said that he quite appreciated the grounds of our objection, but that he was in a position of considerable difficulty. He thought, however, that if we would agree to the formal inclusion of fuel oil in the monopoly he could induce his Government to accept a proviso excluding from its scope oil-fuel for industry and transport, and he promised to suggest a formula for that purpose. But we said that we were not in a position to give any indication of the reception which would he given to such a proposal ; we could promise only that it would be carefully considered. We then discussed the question of the safeguarding the interest of oil companies producing within the Turkish Empire, and in particular^ put forward the suggestion that the Anglo-Persian group should he given a substantial interest in the monopoly company if and when established. Hakki Pasha said that he could not m the least foretell the form which the Regie, if established, would take, and that consequently he did not see how any undertaking could be given to the Anglo-Persian group. He thought, however, that the monopoly would probably be granted to a company which would raise its capital by an issue of shares, and that it would be perfectly open to the Anglo-Persian group to' take up any proportion of those shares that they agreed to subscribe for. We then referred to the question of the scope of the monopoly, and Hakki Pasha said that a monopoly of production (outside any regions that might be specially allocated to concessionnaires in the convention now under discussion) was no contemplated by the Turkish Government. , . . , , ^ ii Mr. Parker and I said that it was clearly necessary for the position to be carefully considered in the light of the desire of the Turkish Government to include oil-fuel and of the explanations which Hakki Pasha had given, and the further discussion of the matter was accordingly postponed. I have had some conversation since with Herr Stauss, who says that he does not regard the establishment of a monopoly as likely to have any harmful effect on o p e tions of any company which may be formed for Mesopotamia. He thinks that t y would naturally, lo fir as they Jshed to sell in Turkey, ““S and that, if the Mesopotamian area should prove as prolific as is expected, the ioca market would be of quite small impoitance to it. p ^ [2034 q—l] JA 26 FEB 1914 / Copv v f-7 FEB 1914[ms Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty 1 TURKEY.

HERR EMIL STAUSS came to see me at Gwydyr House yesterday and we had some conversation on the subject of the Mesopotamkn oil concession. ' i * S , taUSS int l ir ^ a1 ; ed that the Deutsche Bank are ready, so far as concerns mn^ss or’nV' 1 ’ 06 , ''N 7 t0 the P ro P, osals that ^ere shall beOor the Mesopotamian concession, (1) an exploration company, for which the capital shall be provided by the groups concerned, and (2) an exploitation company, for which the capital should lie raised in the open market. He pointed out, however, that it might be unnecessary to tor,n two companies but in any event the principles indicated above as to the mode of raismo- capital would be adopted. As regards the chairmanship, Herr Stanss repeated what he had said formerly namely that the chairmanship would naturally go in the first instance to a nominee of ru Al ’ Cy grou P’ as re P res entmg the largest interest, and that so long as the business ot the company were satisfactorily conducted there could be practically no doubt that the same chairman (especially if he were a person of standing) would be^re-elected ; this was desirable from the point of view of continuity of policy. Herr Stauss thought, however, that the chairman should be elected annually, which is the practice in the case of the principal German oil companies. I pointed out that the chairmanship was even more important in the period of exploitation than in that of exploration. Herr Stauss said that he would be willing to agree that the chairman in the first year of both companies, or in the first years of exploration and exploitation respectively (in the event of there being only one company), should be nominated by the D’Arcy group, and his remarks as to re-election applied equally to both cases; but he did not at present see his way to agree formally to the proposal that the first chairman should hold office for a period of several years. I asked him, however, to bear the matter in mind further, as an agreement to the effect suggested would greatly facilitate a settlement. Leaving this question, and assuming that an agreement between the D’Arcy group and the Deutsche Bank could be attained, we discussed the procedure to be adopted. I said that there appeared to be two possible courses : (1) the D’Arcy group to be substituted for the National Bank of Turkey in the Turkish Petroleum Company, and (2) the D’Arcy group and the Turkish Petroleum Company to combine to form a new company, in which each would have 50 per cent. ; the National Bank would then, or previously, transfer its holding in the Turkish Petroleum Company to the Deutsche Bank and Anglo-Saxon Company in equal moieties. I added that in view of the position of M. Gulbenkian, his desire to remain interested in the concession, and his contention that the National Bank could not legally transfer his shares without his consent, the first of the two alternatives set out above seemed impracticable ; and we were therefore driven back on the second alternative. Herr Stauss agreed that the first course is clearly impossible, and in his opinion it is necessary, in order to clear the way, that either M. Gulbenkian’s interest be eliminated, or that the Turkish Petroleum Company be wound up. Herr Stauss explained that the Deutsche Bank only learned a few weeks ago of this sub-participation of M. Gulbenkian, otherwise, in his opinion, they never would have joined the Turkish Petroleum Company. Seeing that M. Gulbenkian, in all questions concerning oil companies, is intimately connected with the Royal Dutch-Shell interests, his participation practically resulted in the Royal Dutch-Shell interests having the biggest share in the Turkish Petroleum Company, which was contrary to the spirit of the foundation of that company. Herr Stauss further stated his personal opinion that if the National Bank of Turkey should not be able to come to a settlement with M. Gulbenkian, the Deutsche Bank would prefer a full liquidation of the Turkish Petroleum Company and a restoration of the status quo, which practically would lead to their dissociation from both the National Bank of Turkey and the Shell interests. [2034 q-2] 1 Copy V 26FE81914,t) l CV FEB19Ur: 'v The first step was, however, to settle the question of the Turkish Petroleum Company. Herr Stauss was accordingly disposed to suggest to his friends m Berlin on his return that a letter should be addressed to Sir H. Babington Smith to the eftect that as the British, German, and Turkish Governments are very desirous of seeing a •. settlement reached speedily, and seeing that the National Bank found themselves in such a complicated situation with M. Gulbenkian, the Deutsche Bank feel entitled to ask that the National Bank shall either make such arrangements as will eliminate M Gulbenkian’s interest and enable a clear offer of 50 per cent, in t e ur ish Petroleum Company to be made to the D’Arcy group, or co-operate with the Deutsche Bank in bringing about the winding-up of the Turkish Petroleum Company and the restoration of the status 3 uo. In the former case the D’Arcy group would simply enter the Turkish Petroleum Company with a clear oO per cent, interest, if the latter alternative be adopted the field would be clear for the formation of a new combination, which might be 50 per cent. Deutsche Bank and 50 per cent. D Arcy group, or 50 per cent. D’Arcy group, 25 per cent. Deutsche Bank and 2o per cent. Ang o-Saxon Company, as may prove practicable and expedient. Herr Stauss was of opinion that such a communication to the National Bank might prepare a speedy settlement; it would, however, probably be viewed with disfavour by M. Deterdmg, if he attaches importance to the maintenance of M. Gulbenkian’s position. ~ X have again seen Herr Stauss this morning, and pointed put that it is not possible for His Britannic Majesty’s Government to express any opinion as to the course to be taken in this particular matter, which is primarily an internal concern of the iurkish Petroleum Company. The discussions which we have had with the National Bank have been based throughout on the assumption that the D’Arcy group could be admitted to an absolutely clear 50 per cent, interest in the Turkish Petroleum Company, and/or the Mesopotamian concession. Such a participation is a fundamental condition of any settlement acceptable to His Britannic Majesty’s Government; and if the internal arrangements of the Turkish Petroleum Company present any obstacle to such settle ment,^it is for the parties to that company to remove them. This is an agreed record of our conversations. February 14, 1914. P. A.■Ij-Mg Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government,] TURKEY.

Winchester House, Old Broad Street, k ]r ’ TT ttt— i ,ip ^ London, January 30, 1914:. &gt; 1 HAVE the honour to refer to ray letter of the 23rd January replying to your j letter of theTdth idem regarding the Mesopotamian oil concession. In view of the intimation they have received that a very early decision in this matter is required and as the negotiations regarding the Admiralty contract have meanwhile advanced a stage, my colleagues have carefully reconsidered the proposals communicated to them at the Board of Trade conference of the 28th November. Those proposals were that the oil concession in the provinces of Mosul and Bagdad should be granted to the British group, represented by Mr. D’Arcy and his colleagues, and to the Turkish Petroleum Company in equal shares, that is to say— 50 per cent, to the British group, and 50 per cent, to the Turkish Petroleum Company, of which 25 per cent, would be taken by the “ Shell ” Company, and 25 per cent, by the Deutsche Bank. It was also suggested that the first chairman of the company formed should be British. Seeing that in the opinion of the Foreign Office no better terms are obtainable, at any rate in the direction indicated by the conditions 3 and 4 suggested in my letter of the 9th December, my colleagues, after careful examination and discussion, are willing to accept the proposals made, subject to the following remarks :— In your letter of the 16th January you do not comment on the conditions 1 and 2 suggested in my letter of the 9th December, and it is therefore assumed that they are not unacceptable to the Foreign Office. I am to say that my colleagues regard them as of great importance if the continued participation in the concession of the British group is to be properly safeguarded. For the attainment of this object, it is imperative that it should not be in the power of the foreign group (the stronger group both financially and commercially) either to insist on the formation at once of a large company before the field is proved, or to demand that the capital of such a company when formed should be provided by the concessionnaires pro rata, and should not be raised by a public issue. My colleagues would therefore urge very earnestly that every effort should be made to secure these safeguards as part of the Crovernment s assent to this final settlement. As regards the chairmanship, I may add that it was understood, both at the conference at the Board of Prade and also at the inteiviews which I subsequently had with Herr Stauss, that no serious objection was likely to be raised to the proposal that the first chairman should be British, provided he was a gentleman of eminence. I am to suggest that every effort should be made by the Foreign Office to insist on the acceptance of this condition, and also to secure that the term for which the chairman should hold office be not less than eight years. A shorter term than this, especially m the early period of its formation and development, would not be conducive to the company’s prosperity. have) &amp;c . C.

I HAD an interview with Hakki Pasha to-day to discuss the draft agreement about monopolies, irrigation, Aden boundary, &amp;c. Definite progress was made regarding nearly all points except pecuniary claims, which are to be discussed on Friday next, and it is hoped that the draft agreement can be initialled ad referendum next week. Hakki Pasha said he thought his Government would agree to our draft about the Syrian and Farsan oil concessions, and to the line which it is proposed should be drawn from Kataba (Aden) to the Ruba-al-Khaila, thus definitely excluding from Turkish influence the w r hole of the Hadramaut, where it is thought oil may exist. I explained to Hakki Pasha that we could not consider satisfactory any settlement of the Mesopotamian oil question w T hich failed to secure to the Company to whom the concession was granted some rights of distribution in the provinces of Mosul and Bagdad. Pie said that he understood this, and that his idea was that the Government should give to all the companies interested in the production of oil in Turkey a share in the monopoly for distribution, but Russia, as being the country which at present sent the most oil to Turkey, would have to have the largest share of a monopoly. He also said that he wanted to have, by next Friday, a more precise list of the sorts of petroleum products which His Majesty’s Government wished to exclude from the scope of the monopoly, as he must insist that they should be specified in full detail in the agreement. I said I would endeavour to obtain such information from the Board of Trade. He then said that he wished to speak very seriously to me about the Mesopotamian concession; the Ottoman Government was being very seriously embarrassed by the delay in the settlement of this question, and they felt that they were being penalised on account of a domestic quarrel between British interests. They could not afford to wait indefinitely, and he himself was placed in an invidious ^ position as eight months ago he had advised the Turkish Government to do nothing, and now they were representing to him that such inactivity was most unprofitable and incon\ enient. told Hakki Pasha that we hoped to be able to put a definite scheme before him very shortly, perhaps even this week. He said that he had to reply to a telegram from ms Government, and he would defer the answer till he saw me on 1 nday. e a e that he had again seen M. Gulbenkian, who had said that he had 15 per cent, of the share capital of the Turkish Petroleum Company out of the oO per cent held by the National Bank of Turkey; he was willing to come to terms with His Majesty s Government about the question ; but he was not going to allow the National Bank of Turkey to bargain awav his rights and if they attempted to do so he would send a solicitor to see them and they would be involved m a law suit in which he was sure to win. Hakki Pasha said he thought it very imprudent that His Majesty s Govern ment did not enter into communication with M. Gulbenkian, a t Brlt y h ., P Timkish otherwise they might find a fresh difficulty at the last moment and the Turkish Government wmuld be asked to postpone a decision again, which they certainly could not afford to do. He urged that M.

Minute by Sir Arthur Nicolson. SIR HUGH BARNES, representing the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, called to-day and I saw him with Mr. Parker. He said his company was anxious to defer a reply to our letter of 16th January (annexed) respecting the Mesopotamian oil concession pending a decision of the Admiralty as to the proposed contract: this decision the Admiralty could apparently not reach for some weeks. I asked Sir Hugh Barnes why the two questions were inter-independent. He replied that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would be in a much stronger position financially with such a contract, and they would therefore be better able to resist the pressure which would be put upon them by their proposed partners (the Shell and the Deutsche Bank groups) in the company to be formed to work the Mesopotamian concession: for instance, those partners might propose that each of the groups in the proposed company should put up say 2,000,000Z. privately, and with out a public issue ; those two groups might carry such a resolution on the board, and the Anglo- Persian could not then comply with the resolution, with the result that they would be forced to agree to absorption by the Shell. I asked Sir Hugh Barnes if this danger would not be averted if the two first conditions enumerated in Mr. Greenway’s letter of the 9th December to the Board of Trade were secured ? He replied that possibly this might be so, and said he would discuss the matter with his colleagues. The conditions are as follows :— 1. That a syndicate to prospect and test the Mesopotamian fields be formed with a capital of 100,000L (or, if necessary, 200,000L), 50 percent, of the capital of which would be taken by our group and 50 per cent, by the Turkish Petroleum Company. 2. That the members of this syndicate shall undertake to form a working company with a capital of not less than 1,000,000Z. should they be satisfied with the examination of the fields—the &lt; 0 l rut Copy ^ 30 JAN 19142 i I capital of such company, if so desired by any member, to be raised by a public issue of debentures and/or shares. I said that I was not aware that these con ditions could be procured, but I suggested that his company might make the acceptance of them conditions of agreeing to our letter of the 16th January, at all events in the first instance. He said there was a further condition to which his company attached paramount importance, namely, that the chairman for a series of years should be British, and he asked if, in the event of some eminent man (he instanced Lord Milner) being put forward, we could not obtain the assent of the other groups. I said this was rather doubtful, but if the Anglo-Persian Company put it forward again as one of their desiderata we would try to secure it, though it should not be put forward as a sine qua non. Sir Hugh Barnes was informed that the great danger of delay in the reply of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to our letter of the 16th January was that the Turkish Government, who were very pressed for funds, might give the concession to the Standard Oil Company in return for a loan. We had promised them to try and give a definite reply about the Mesopotamian concession by the end of the month. Although I urged all these points upon Sir Hugh Barnes, he seemed to persist in the necessity of a reply from the Admiralty about the proposed contract before a reply could be sent to the Foreign Office letter of the 16th January about the Mesopotamian concession. He dwelt a good deal upon the financial attractions of amalgamation with the Shell to the Anglo- Persian Company, though he evidently realised how undesirable it would be that the Anglo- Persian, the principal British undertaking in Persia, should pass under Dutch control. He said that one effect of such amalgamation would be to raise the price of oil-fuel at once. A. N.

In your letter of the 9th December you indicate the following four conditions as ottering the only basis upon which a 50 per cent, participation would afford the Anglo-Persian Oil Company a sufficient amount of protection : — 1. That a syndicate to prospect and test the Mesopotamian fields he formed with a capital of 100,000Z. (or, if necessary, 200,0001), 50 per cent, of the capital of which would be taken by the Anglo-Persian group and 50 per cent, by the Turkish Petroleum Company. hhat the members of this syndicate shall undertake to form a working company with a capital of not less than 1,000,000L should they be satisfied with the examination of the fields, the capital of such company, if so desired by any member, to be raised by a public issue of debentures and/or shares. 3. That the chairman of such syndicate and/or company shall always be nominated by us, and shall have a casting vote, the other members of the board being nominated half by us and half by the foreign group. 4. That the firm of Strick, Scott, and Co. (Limited), of Bagdad, shall be appointed the permanent managing agents of the syndicate and/or company in Turkey. You are already aware that, since the recent decision of the National Bank of Turkey to disinterest itself in the Turkish Petroleum Company, the Board of Trade have had prolonged and detailed discussions with Herr Stauss, representing the Deutsche Bank group of that company, and that they have been in communication with Mr. Detterding, as representing the Anglo-Saxon group, regarding the settlement of this complicated question. The Board of Trade have ascertained that, as regards the third and fourth conditions laid down in your letter, there is no prospect whatever that anything His Majesty’s Government could do would induce either of the groups to go beyond the proposals already communicated to you at the conference which took place at the Board of Trade on the 28th November. Sir E. Grey considers, however, that those proposals do in fact offer a reasonable solution of a very difficult problem, and should satisfy Mr. D’Arcy’s equitable claims; and he can hold out no hope of obtaining better terms. The German interests concerned always had certain indisputable claims under the Bagdad Railway Convention of 1903; their claims are based upon a formal convention, those of Mr. D’Arcy upon an oral assurance of later date, of which no record exists in the archives of the Ottoman Government. While His Majesty’s Government have been anxious to secure the best possible terms for Mr. D’Arcy, they are of opinion that the provisions of the above convention do in effect debar him from any claim to a monopoly to the oil wells in the vilayets of Mosul and Bagdad, and that the only possible settlement of this question is by arrangement with the Germans. Moreover, a stage has now been reached in the general negotiations with Germany and Turkey which renders it essential that the Mesopotamian oil question, which is one of the few outstanding points in those regions, should also be settled. Both therefore on general grounds, and in view of the equitable solution which the settlement proposed appears to His Majesty’s Government to offer to Mr. DArcy, I am to request that you will be so good as to inform Hip Majesty’s Government at an early date whether the group which you represent are willing to enter into an arrangement on the terms which have been communicated to them, or would prefer to stand out of the Mesopotamian concession altogether, these being, in Sir E.

British consul has telegraphed British Embassy asking them to make enquiries. Have you any information ? ” In conversation recently with Herr Stauss, the representative of the Deutsche Bank, he mentioned that his bank was endeavouring to obtain this monopoly as one of the conditions in connection with the general settlement between the Powers, but that any such monopoly would, he presumed, provide that the monopoly should not prejudice in any way the rights of sale of oil by present or future concessionnaires of oil lands in Turkish territory. In this connection my board desire me to enquire whether this point is being considered in connection with the negotiations now going on in respect of the Mesopotamian oil concession, and also what would be the position of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company in regard to sales of oil in Turkish territory should such a monopoly be granted. At present the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited) are selling a considerable quantity of oil in Turkish territory, and it would be extremely prejudicial to them were the Turkish markets to be closed to their products. &gt; ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. 1 ^ S '“'4 [December 2T J ’ CONFIDENTIAL.

WIIH reference to your letter of the 17th December on the subject of the exploitation of petroleum deposits in Asiatic Turkey, I am directed by the Board of Trade to state that they concur in the tenour of the reply which Sir E. Grey proposes to address to Lord Cowdray. j r r I am, &amp;c. GEO. J. STANLEY.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] WITH reference to your letter of the 15th December, and to previous informal inter departmental communications on the subject of the Mesopotamian Oil concession, I am directed by the Board of Trade to forward to you herewith, for Sir E. Grey’s information, copies of certain recent correspondence with Herr Emil Stauss and Mr. C. Green way, together with a departmental minute on conversations between these two parties. As regards the four conditions which are stated in Mr. Greenway’s letter of the 9th December to be essential to the acceptance, by the group which he represents, of the scheme for an ecjual division of interests between that group on the one hand and the Deutsche Bank and Anglo-Saxon Company groups on the other hand, the Board see no prospect whatever of inducing the two latter groups to agree to the third condition, as to the chairmanship, and think it unlikely that they would agree at the present stage to the fourth condition, as to the managing agents. The other two conditions suggested by Mr. Greenway’s group, as to the fmancing of the prospecting and operating companies, do not appear to raise any insurmountable difficulties; though objection might be taken to them by the Anglo-Saxon group, they would, it is under stood, be not inacceptable to the Deutsche Bank. After the fullest consideration the Board see no reason to modify their opinion that, in all the circumstances, the scheme outlined in the memorandum of Sir H. Llewellyn Smith’s conversation with Herr Stauss of the 14th November, 1.913‘(copy of which has represents, in their opinion, the maximum participation, in capital and control, which could be obtained for Mr. Greenway’s group by negotiation on the present lines. I am to suggest, therefore, for Sir E. Grey’s consideration, that Mr. Greenway might further be informed that His Majesty’s Government remain of opinion that those proposals offer a reasonable solution of a very difficult problem, and should satisfy Mr. D’Arcy’s equitable claims; and that Sir E. Grey can hold out no hope of obtaining better terms. Mr. Greenway might then be requested to inform His Majesty’s j Government definitely at an early date whether the group which he represents are j willing to enter into an arrangement on the terms which have been communicated to them, or would prefer to stand out of the Mesopotamian concession altogether, these being the only alternative courses. _ I In this connection I am to state that the Board have reason to believe that in the event of the Anglo-Persian group not wishing to proceed further in the matter, the participation of another British group would be acceptable to the Deutsche Bank. The Board would be glad to have the opportunity of seeing the draft of any letter which Sir E. Grey may propose to address to Mr. Greenway, and I am to suggest that the Admiralty should also be consulted before its despatch. The Board see no objection to Herr Stauss’s suggestion, mentioned in some of the papers sent herewith, that the Anglo-Persian or some other British Group should take the place of the National Bank in the Turkish Petroleum Company, but they think it should be made absolutely clear that such action would not pledge His Majesty’s Government to support the company for any particular concession in any part of turkey other th'' ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

It also should be informed that the Board have ascertained that whilst the first two conditions laid down in his letter of the 9th December would probably not be acceptable to one of the two other groups interested in this matter, there is as regards the third and fourth conditions no prospect whatever that His Majesty’s Government would be able to induce either of the groups to go beyond the proposals already communicated to him. He Copy t?&gt; ?nd J a 9 JAN 19U2 Finally, I am to refer to Sir Eyre Crowe’s letter of the 15th December, and to suggest, for Sir E. Grey’s consideration, that Sir H. Babington Smith might be informed that whilst His Majesty’s Government cannot raise any objection to the immediate transference of the National Bank’s shares to the Deutsche Bank and the Anglo-Saxon Company, should the National Bank think such a course desirable, they think it might be more convenient if any action in this particular matter could be deferred for about a month, by which time it is hoped that a solution of the whole question may have been reached. In any event the arrangements to be made in respect of M. Gulbenkian’s shares, and his relations with any of the groups at present represented in the Turkish Petroleum Company, would not appear to be matters in which His Majesty’s Government, or any British group which may be introduced into the concession company, are in any way concerned. I am, &amp;c. GEO. J. STANLEY. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Sir H. Llewellyn Smith to Herr Stauss. Dear Mr. Stauss, Board of Trade, December 5, 1913. I AM very sorry to hear from Mr. Ashley that your meeting with Mr. Greenway has not resulted in an arrangement satisfactory to both sides. In thinking over the best means of removing the present deadlock, it has occurred to me that one possible method might be for each of the parties concerned to part with a small percentage of their holdings to a neutral group nominated by His Majesty’s Government. Thus, if for the sake of argument the shares of the various parties, instead of being 25, 25, and 50, as contemplated in our recent conversation, were 23, 23, and 46 (or 24, 24, and 48) and the balance were held by some such netral group as I have suggested, it might then be possible to safeguard the legitimate interests of each of the parties, and at the same time to make it impossible for any of them to retard the development of the Mesopotamian oil-field. For this purpose, it would of course be necessary that a binding assurance should be given that the neutral group would throw its influence in favour of the commercial development of the Mesopotamian oil-fields. If you think that there is any possibility of an advance on these lines, perhaps you would let me know. I have no idea how the Anglo-Persian group would regard the proposal, but I could readily find out, if you thought well of it. Yours very truly, H. LLEWELLYN SMITH. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Herr Stauss to Sir H. Llewellyn Smith. Dear Sir Hubert, Savoy Hotel, London, December 6, 1913. I BEG to thank you for your yesterday’s letter and, though your proposal of putting in another neutral group is very interesting, I think we would prefer to settle the question on the lines hitherto considered. Practically we have identified ourselves always with the axiom outlined in your letter for a neutral group, and we would be quite willing to give an undertaking that we shall use our voting influence in the company in favour of such development. I have also informed Mr. Greenway that I am in harmony with the financial plan which he has communicated to me, therefore, so far as we are concerned, everything should be in order. I shall leave here on Thursday morning, and remain, Yours very truly, STAUSS.3 Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Mr. Greenway to Mr Barnes (Board of Trade). ^ Winchester House, Old Broad Street, Dear Mr. Barnes, ^ London, December 9, 1913. I BEGRET to inform you that I have received a letter, of which I enclose a copy, from Herr Stauss advising me that he cannot see any other way for co-operation than an arrangement which would limit the participation of our group to 50 per cent. Moreover, in the course of the conversation I had wdth him a week ago he mentioned that they would not he agreeable to the permanent appointment of a British chairman with a casting vote, but that their proposal was that the appointment should be held for a term of one year only, and that the nomination for it should be alternatively made by the German and the British groups. This renders the proposal even worse than was anticipated by us at the meeting recently held at your office, as it makes it more than ever certain that the control would in effect be foreign, inasmuch as it would be practically impossible for our group, with only a 50 per cent, participation in capital and an even vote on the board, to resist the pressure which would be brought to bear upon us by the two powerful foreign groups. In other words, the Mesopotamian Company would, as we have always feared, unquestionably be used as a weapon of attack on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited). In view of the seriousness of tho position we have carefully considered the possible courses open to us, in the light of the suggestions which you kindly put before us at our recent interview, and have come to the conclusion that the only basis upon which a 50 per cent./50 per cent, participation would give us the necessary amount of protection is the following :— 1. That a syndicate to prospect and test the Mesopotamian fields be formed with a capital of 100,000L (or, if necessary, 200,0001.), 50 per cent, of the capital of which would be taken by our group and 50 per cent, by the Turkish Petroleum Company. 2. That the members of this syndicate shall undertake to form a working company with a capital of not less than 1,000,0001. should they be satisfied with the examination of the fields—the capital of such company, if so desired by any member, to be raised by a public issue of debentures and /or shares. 3. That the chairman of such syndicate and /or company shall always be nominated by us, and shall have a casting vote, the other members of the board being nominated half by us and half by the foreign group. 5. That the firm of Strick, Scott and Co. (Limited), of Bagdad, shall be appointed the permanent managing agents of the syndicate and /or company in Turkey. The reason for limiting the issue of capital in the first place to 100,000L (or 200,0001) is that we could not agree to the formation of a working company with a larger capital until the fields had been satisfactorily proved. The reason for the stipulation as to a public issue in (2) is to prevent the possibility of our group being 4 c squeezed out” ^as was done m another case m whicn we were interested in a similar exploitation syndicate with one of the parties concerned) at a time when any of the members might desire to form a working company, should it not be convenient at that time for us to provide 50 per cent, of the capital required. If you think it may be practicable to conclude an arrangement on the above lines, Sir Hugh and I will be glad to meet you again to discuss any further details regarding which you may desire explanations. I may mention that Herr Stauss said that he had not heard of the 50 per cent, proposal coupled with certain marketing arrangements, put forward in my lettei of the 12th June last. I hardly think this likely, but I mention the point as, if this proposal has not been put before him, it may afford another possible solution of the difficulty. Yours sincerely, C. GREEN WAY. P S Might it not help to strengthen the position vis-a-vis the foreign groups if the British Government were to take 25 per cent, of the 50 per cent to be allocated to the British group? Herr Stauss rather suggested that the Deutsche Banks per cent was being taken wholly or in part on behalf of the German Government.4 Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Kerr Stauss to Mr. Greenway. ( Dear Mr. Green way, December 5, 1913. I HAVE fully considered the situation of our interests in the Turkish oil-fields again in the light of your remarks, but I am very sorry I do not see any other way for a sincere active co-operation with your group in this business unless you accept an arrangement which will limit your participation to 50 per cent, and give the German interests an opportunity of utilising their experience in all questions concerned. As explained orally, you will always find us at your side to achieve a reasonable development of the oil territories in question, and to dispose of the products on reasonable terms. I would be glad if your interests could see your way to coincide with our views, and remain Yours very truly, E. G. STAUSS. Enclosure 5 in No. 1. Mr. Barnes to Mr. Greenway. Dear Mr. Greenway, Board of Trade, December 10, 1913. I HAVE to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th December on the subject of the Mesopotamian oil concession. As you have been informed this afternoon by telephone, Herr Stauss has suggested that a further meeting between him and yourself, at which representatives of the Board of trade could be present, might be advantageous. He has, however, been informed that it is, in our opinion, advisable that any discussions which you may have should continue, at least for the present, to be of an unofficial character. We are disposed to think that a further discussion between Herr Stauss and your self might be useful, and that, in particular, it might be w^ell if the question of the chairmanship could be reconsidered, as I note that there seems to be some divergence between your interpretation of Herr Stauss’s statement on this matter and our under standing of it. As we understand that the further discussion which has been suggested is aoreeable to you, we propose to defer consideration of your letter until we know whetlier you desire to modify it in any way in consequence of such discussion. Yours very truly, G. S. BABNES. Enclosure 6 in No. 1. Mr. Ashley to Herr Stauss. Dear Herr Stauss, ^ Board of Trade, December 10, ] 913. WITH reference to our telephonic conversation of this morning, Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith desires me to express his appreciation of your willingness to have a further discussion with Mr. Greenw r ay, which he thinks might be advantageous, but to say that it would, in his opinion, be preferable for such discussion to be of the same informal character as the previous one, and for the Board of Trade not to participate at the present stage. I have ascertained that Mr. Greenway would be glad of the opportunity for a further discussion (which might take place to-morrow), and perhaps you could communicate with him by telephone to arrange a time. So soon as possible after we have learned the outcome of any discussion which may take place between you, and are m possession of the definite views of Mr. Greenway’s group, a further communication will be addressed to you. In the meantime,Sir H. Llewellyn Smith desires me to enquire if your letter to him of the 6th December is intended to mean that you regard the suggestion for a small neutral group as wholly unacceptable, or only as undesirable if an agreement can be reached in any other way. Yours very truly, ^ PERCY ASHLEY. Enclosure 7 in No. 1. Herr Stauss to Mr. Ashley. Dear Mr. Ashley, Savoy Hotel, London, December 10, 1913. THANKS very much for your to-day’s letter. I have written to Mr, Greenway asking him whether I can meet him to-morrow, when I shall let you know the outcome of an eventual discussion. In reply to your question about Sir H. Llewellyn Smith’s suggestion, I beg to say that I would rather prefer not to put it forward as I do not think we can accept it. Relieve me, &amp;c. STAUSS. Enclosure 8 in No. 1. Minute by Mr. Ashley. IN accordance with Sir H. Llewellyn Smith’s instructions I communicated to Mr. Green way on Wednesday afternoon Herr Stauss’s suggestion for a further discussion. Mr. Greenway agreed to the suggestion, and a long conference between Mr. Greenway, Sir Hugh Barnes, and Herr Stauss took place yesterday morning. Subsequently Sir Hugh Barnes telephoned to me to say that in the course of the discussion, which I understand was a very amicable one, Mr. Greenway had put forward the four conditions, which, as indicated in his letter to Mr. Barnes of the 9th December, his group regards as essential if they are to enter into combination on a 50 per cent, basis. Those conditions were :— 1. That a syndicate to prospect and test the Mesopotamian fields be formed with a capital of 100,000L (or, if necessary, 200,000Z.), 50 per cent, of the capital of which would be taken by our group, and 50 per cent, by the lurkish Petroleum Company. 2. That the members of this syndicate shall undertake to form a working company with a capital of not less than 1,000,0001. should they be satisfied with the examination of the fields—the capital of such company, if so desired by any member, to be raised by a public issue of debentures and/or shares. 3. That the chairman of such syndicate and/or company shall always be nominated by us, and shall have a casting vote, the other members of the board being nominated half by us and half by the foreign group. _ n n n , 4. That the firm of Strick Scott and Co. (Limited), of Bagdad, shall be appointed the permanent managing agents of the syndicate and/or company in Turkey. According to Sir Hugh Barnes, Herr Stauss had no objection whatever to conditions 1 and 2. i • • u u With regard to condition 4 he appeared to have no strong objection, thougn ne saw no reason for making any arrangement at this stage as to the “ managing agents. Condition 3—as to the chairmanship—was the crux of the problem. Mr. Greenway appears to have reiterated his assertion that, unless the Deutsche Rank group would guarantee that they would always support the nominee of the Anglo-Persian group as to the chairmanship, the Anglo-Persian group could not enter into the proposed com bination. Herr Stauss, on the other hand, appears to have maintained that the otter made by him in his communications with the Board of trade, and _ which admittedly Mr Greenway had not entirely understood, would be sufficient security lor the Anglo- Persian interests. Mr. Greenway and Sir Hugh Barnes understood, however, tnat Herr Stauss would give some further consideration to the question, and the matter was left at that point. [1963 y—2 C6 In the course of the conversation Herr Stauss made it clear that the Deutsche Bank would have no objection to the Anglo-Persian group being substituted for the National Bank group in the Turkish Petroleum Company. Mr. Greenway said that he thought the Board of Trade had some objection to this course, but I have told Sir Hugh Barnes that I did not think we had any objection to it, and that we had^ suggested the other course, viz., the formation by the Turkisli Petroleum Company and the Anglo-Persian group of a separate . company for Mesopotamia, because we thought that this would be the simplest arrangement and most acceptable to the interests concerned in the Turkish Petroleum Company. Sir Hugh Barnes and Mr. Greenway appeared to have left the conference with Herr Stauss with some hopes that the latter might meet their wishes. Late in the afternoon Herr Stauss came to see me, as he wished to make his position quite clear before he left London for Berlin early this morning. He said that he would be quite ready to admit the Anglo-Persian group to the position now occupied by the National Bank in the Turkish Petroleum Company, and that that would be the best solution from every point of view. If the Turkish Petroleum Company were reconstituted so as to include only the Deutsche Bank and the Anglo-Saxon Company there would be two disadvantages from the point of view of the Anglo-Persian Company. The first would be that the Turkish Petroleum Company might acquire other oil areas in Turkey from which the Anglo-Persian Company’s interests might conceivably be threatened, and, secondly, if the Deutsche Bank and the Anglo-Saxon Company were partners by themselves in other oil business in Turkey there would be a much stronger tendency than would otherwise exist tor them to act together in respect of the Mesopotamian field. He would be prepared to do his utmost to facilitate the substitution of the Anglo-Persian group for the National Bank, and said that it was a matter of indifference whether the National Bank shares were bought by the Deutsche Bank and the Anglo-Saxon Company and then handed over to the .Anglo-Persian group or refused by the two first- named groups and transferred direct from the National Bank to the Anglo-Persian group. He referred to the position of M. Gulbenkian, and said that M. Deterding had told him that afternoon that M. Gulbenkian had entrusted M. Deterding with the charge of his interests (“put his fate in my hands” were M. Deterding’s words). Herr Stauss asked M. Deterding what he meant to do in the matter. M. Deterding did not seem to know, but said that he was not going to let down M. Gulbenkian. M. Deterding also said that his group (the Shell) had employed M. Gulbenkian some years ago to endeavour to get them oil concessions at Constantinople, but that M. Gulbenkian had come to the conclusion that co-operation with the Deutsche Bank would be better than competition. It is, I think, from this, and what we have been told by Sir Henry Babington Smith, fairly clear that M. Gulbenkian actually engineered the formation of the Turkish Petroleum Company. Herr Stauss’s view is that the arrangements made by the National Bank with M. Gulbenkian as to shares are very probably quite illegal, but that, in any case, it is the business of the National Bank to settle with M. Gulbenkian, and to compensate him out of the quite small amount which they will receive as the price of their shares; it is not the business of anybody else. Herr Stauss then said that, with regard to Mr. Greenway’s four conditions, he had no objection to the financial proposals ; it was quite possible that M. Deterding would object, but he could be voted down when the preliminary company had been formed, and he (Herr Stauss) was inclined to think that, with a view to obviating difficulties at this stage, it would be well for Mr. Greenway not to press condition No. 2, as to the offering of shares for public subscription. The Deutsche Bank, however, would support the views of the Anglo-Persian group when the matter came up for a decision. With regard to the question of management, he thought it undesirable for the company to be committed to any particular firm of “ managing agents ” at the present stage. As regards the very important question of the chairmanship, he could only repeat what he had already said. I said that we had always understood his position to be that the Deutsche Bank would support the election of chairman, for the first year, from the Anglo-Persian group. They thought that the chairmanship would normally go, as a matter of course, to a nominee of that group who would represent the largest interest, and would be prepared to support such a nominee so long as the business of the company was conducted in a satisfactory manner. Herr Stauss said that that exactly represented7 icie 0r the % toli from M the londly, if selves ii in woiild ether tie tlo-SaM 'Persiaii ekrjeof leterdiof )dties at $ to tfe' He did not think they could \ what he had said and the intent of the Deutsche Bank go further. .u P 6 i^o 11 menti ^ ned that he understood^ that Lord Strathcona was the chairman of ^the Anglo-Persian Company, and said that it was obvious that, if he were the candidate ’put for ward by the Anglo-Persian group for the chairmanship of the new company, it would be impossible tor the other interests to object to the appointment of a person of such standing. I pointed out that Lord Strathcona is a very old man, and is probably now not more than a figurehead, but I am inclined to think that this remark of Herr Stauss may contain the germ of a useful suggestion. If the Anglo-Persian croup could put forward as chairman a person of real importance and standing, it might very greatly strengthen their position. J ^ I tnmk it is absolutely clear that Herr Stauss feels that his group cannot fro anv further. r 6 J He referred to the questions which have been raised in the German Reichstag, and said that he knew perfectly well whence they came ; they were inspired by certain other groups in Germany who were antagonistic to the Deutsche Bank. Now that public attention had been, unfortunately as he thought, directed to the matter in Germany, it would be difficult enough to defend the proposed arrangement, under which it would appear that Germany had on]y a quarter interest in the Mesopotamian field. ^ To appear to reduce that interest still further, either by conceding some portion of their 25 per cent, to the Anglo-Persian group, or by formally agreeing to a permanent non-German chairmanship, would, in his view, now be politically almost impossible. I promised that I would bring all that he had said under Sir H. Llewellyn Smith’s notice. Herr Stauss then asked whether, in the event of the Anglo-Persian group not coming into the arrangement, we could put forward another group. I said that I could, of course, not commit the Board of Trade or His Majesty’s Government in any way on that point, but I thought it was at least possible that we should be in a position to do so. He said that if we could it would be very satisfactory to the interests which he represented. I gathered that Herr Stauss did not propose to communicate again with Mr. Green way ; that he had really nothing further to offer, but he was about to write to Sir Henry Babington Smith to urge that the Anglo-Persian group, or any group nominated by His Majesty’s Government, should be substituted for the National Bank in the Turkish Petroleum Company. I should add that, according to Herr Stauss, M. Deterding has mentioned the matter to Mr. Greenway, and said that he thought it was quite likely that the Anglo- Saxon and the Anglo-Persian might from time to time find themselves in combination agrinst the Deutsche Bank, as they are both concerned largely in Western markets. n in r\-£ 'V* i P l\ o P 1YT P to nc id O/'\P o Tv ttt IiIttvItT P Tv Y*0 I o o tt citvti ,t»ti December 12, 1913.

Minute by Mr. Parker. HAKKI PASHA informed me to-day that he wished to make a very confidential communication to me : it anpeared that his Highness had been under a misapprehen sion with regard to the nature of the holding of Monsieur Gulbenkian in the Turkish Petroleum Company. That gentleman had just visited him, and had explained that he was in no way committed to the Shell interests in regard to the 15 per cent, holding he has in .the Turkish Petroleum Company ; he had, it was true, very close relations with the Shell in other directions, but he was prepared to allow the Anglo- Persian to have the voting power which those shares carried, and he was careful to explain that, under existing arrangements, that voting power was held by the National Hank of Turkey. Monsieur Gulbenkian would further be ready, in order to please His Majesty’s ^ Government, to agree to the Anglo-Persian Company having the chairmanship of the Turkish Petroleum Company. This information is of course diametrically opposed to what Hakki Pasha told me a f ew days ago. Perhaps some pressure has been exercised upon Monsieur Gulbenkian by the National Bank of Turkey.. • . . . i «• Hakki Pasha then said he wished to make a personal communication on behait ot Monsieur Gulbenkian. That gentleman wished it conveyed to the i’oreign Office that he was a British subject of some substance; that he was prepared to put 150,000/, himself into the Turkish Petroleum Company, and that he hoped His Majesty s Government would appreciate his attitude in ceding his voting rights to the Anglo- Persian Company. He wished, however, to make it clear that he did not think much of Ihe commercial reputation in the City of the D’Arcy group (Anglo-Persian Oil Company) and he hoped that in placing himself completely in the power of Mr D Arcy, whom he did not trust, he should enjoy a measure of protection ot His Majesty s Government as otherwise there would be floods of promotion money and the conces- ion wmdd not be properly developed.

A participation, amounting to thiee-tenths of the National 'Bank’s share, or 15 per cent, of the whole capital of the company, was assigned to Mr. Gulbenkian. The only other participation was one oi similar amount assigned to Sir Ernest Cassel personal y. No question arises as to Sir Ernest Cassel s shares, as thev will be dealt with in the same way as the shares of the National Bank.

I HAD to-day an informal conversation with Herr Stauss, who represents the Deutsche Bank, on the subject of a possible arrangement between the D’Arcy group, the Deutsche Bank, and the Anglo-Saxon Company for the operation of a proposed concession for oil in the vilayets of Bagdad and Mosul. Herr Stauss sees objections to conceding 51 per cent, of the capital of the new company to the D’Arcy group, but he would support a proposal that the D’Arcy group should have 50 per cent., the Deutsche Bank 25 per cent., and the Anglo-Saxon Company 25 per cent. The first chairman of the company would be nominated by the D’Arcy group, and Herr Stauss is personally of opinion that the position of chairman would always be held by a representative of the same group, as representing the largest interest, unless there should be special reasons to the contrary at any time. He would further agree that the British Government should have an option on fuel oil produced by the new company up to (say) 40 per cent, of the output, and I said I thought there would be no objection to a similar arrangement being made by the German Government. Herr Stauss would also agree that a fair proportion, say 50 per cent., of such of the higher employes of the company as are not Ottoman subjects should be nominated by the Anglo-Persian Company and should be British subjects, if competent British candidates were forthcoming. ^ I explained to Herr Stauss the apprehensions entertained by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who represent the D’Arcy group, that the new company might use its position to undersell the Anglo-Persian Company in its own markets, and thus diive it into submission or amalgamation. Herr Stauss thought that such fears would be groundless in the event of the D’Arcy group having 50 per cent, of the control, especially as the Deutsche Bank would certainly not suppoit any policy of the kind. It was agreed that Herr Stauss should speak to Mr. Deter ding, and that we (the Board of Trade) should communicate with the representatives of the D Arcy group, so that direct communications might be opened rip between the three groups on Herr Stauss’ return from Berlin in about a week s time. Yours very sincerely, PERCY ASHLEY. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Minute by Sir H. Llewellyn Smith. H. LI. S. November 14, 1913. (Confidential.) Dear Mr. Ashley. I BEG to thank you for your Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Herr Stauss to Mr. Ashley. 8, Behrenstrasse, Berlin, November 20, 1913. your favour of the 15th November, handing me over only like to make the following explanatory remaiks .2 and to continue doing so from year to year as long as we thought that the business of the company was conducted on satisfactory lines. We understood that it was the intention of all parties to achieve a steady development of the Mesopotamian oil-fields, and to dispose of the products at reasonable prices. Option for British and German Navy on Fuel Oil. —In this point there seems to me to be a slight misunderstanding, inasmuch as I understood we were speaking of the export of fuel oil. Of the total output, a high percentage, which might be as much as 10 per cent., might be used for the works of the company (wells, refinery), and it might be possible to sell a certain amount of the fuel oil in Turkey. But also as regards the export, I thought the company should be free to sell a certain amount to other customers without offering it first to the navies of both our countries. But I would see no objection to reserve a preferential right for 40 per cent, of the export fuel oil to each of both navies if the conditions for exercising such right be worded so that the business of the company would not be hampered ; I explained that I would think it a reasonable arrangement to give the navies in each case for twenty-four hours the first refusal. Nationality of Higher Employes. —In this respect, as I explained, we would ask that a fair proportion should be German subjects, if candidates were forthcoming on reasonable terms. I have discussed meanwhile the whole question with M. von Gwinner, who told me that he agrees to my views. I had, further, the opportunity to discuss before my departure from London the situation with Mr. Deterding, who said that he would think the matter over up to my return to London. I beg to mention that I will leave here on Saturday evening, and stay the greater part of next week in London, Savoy Hotel. Believe me, &amp;c. STAUSS (By order, V. J. McCarthy). Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Minute by Mr. Ashley. Mr. H. W. A. DETERDING came to the Board of Trade this morning, and had an interview with Sir H. Llewellyn Smith on the subject of the Mesopotamian oil concession. He said that he had always been anxious for a settlement of this question which should be satisfactory to British interests, but he thought the scheme outlined in the memorandum communicated to Herr Stauss on the 15th instant (after the latter’s interview with Sir H. Llewellyn Smith) would better the German position quite unnecessarily. The Germans had in the Turkish Petroleum Company only a 25 per cent, interest; it had been made clear to them that they could have no more; the scheme now proposed would give them a better position (Mr. Deterding apparently meant that the Germans would have one-half, instead of one-quarter, in anything the Turkish Petroleum Company might acquire outside the Bagdad and Mosul vilayets). The scheme would also give the German Government a claim in respect of fuel oil, which it had not, and could not have obtained, under the Turkish Petroleum Company’s arrangements. Sir H. LI. Smith pointed out that we had to regard this matter not as an isolated transaction, but as part of a general settling up of questions in Mesopotamia. Mr. Deterding then said that he thought it very unfortunate from every point of view that the National Bank group were going out, and urged that an effort should be made to retain them. Sir H. LI. Smith replied that we understood the decision of the bank to be final, but Mr. Deterding said the decision was due to the feeling that they were distrusted by His Majesty’s Government, and that the Bank would be quite willing to remain in the combination if assured that His Majesty’s Government is not antagonistic to them. Mr. Deterding said further that he and his group, the Anglo-Saxon Company, were ready to meet the wishes of His Majesty’s Government in every way as to safeguarding British interests, and that he had made definite suggestions to Sir F Black for that purpose. He thought the Admiralty greatly exaggerated the importance of the Mesopotamian field as a source of fuel oil; it must be several3 ‘ttess of was ^elds, to) Hof t be as ;Sl amount But I export worded I would ir hours aldasl ling on ho told ore my &gt; would greater ad had ian oil which in the atter's quite 2o per i; the rentlj igthe lyets). el oil) ileum san inia. hew dhe mol that quite snot lany, is to 3 to the reral years before there would be a considerable output of any oil; that the maximum ±Uel 01 \ eV ? ^ went well, in ten years time would not be more than 300,000 tons, most of which would be wanted for local consumption ; and that the geographical position is very^ inconvenient. For this reason he thought the •^requirement of a Butish proportion of the staff unnecessary, as it is also impracticable, skilled oilmen have to be taken wherever they can be found. Mi. Deterding expiessed readiness to take part in any round-table conference between the parties, but asked that be might know first what is meant bv li British interests’’-are they the interests of His Majesty’s Government or of the Anglo- Persian Company ? If the former, he remained of opinion that they were being in a measure sacrificed ; if the latter, he did not see why one British group should be supported against another. He went at some length into the history of the formation of the darkish Petroleum Company, asserting that the inducement held out to the Deutsche Bank and the Anglo-Saxon Company by Sir H. Babington Smith, was that the latter had the support of His Majesty’s Government, without which the concession could not he obtained. Sir H. LI. Smith explained that, without entering into the merits or demerits of the various claims, the fact remained that His Majesty’s Government were pledged to the D’Arcy group. Mr. Deterding then said that be was ready to help the Anglo-Persian Company to safeguard their position in every way (as he had done in his present arrangements with them), and to co-operate in arriving at a settlement; but his group would have nothing to do with any arrangement involving Stock Exchange transactions and large promoters’ profits (which in the case of the Anglo-Persian Company were between 500,0()0L and 600,000L). He believed that on this point negotiations with the Anglo-Persian Company or other representatives of the D’Arcy interests would break down—this had been the real stumbling block hitherto. Mr. Deterding put the requisite capital at 1,000,000L to 1,500,000b ; it was evident that he doubted the ability of the D’Arcy group to find the money. He repeated his recommendation of a round-table conference, but urged that His Majesty’s Government should be represented at such a meeting. P. A. November 18, 1913. Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Sir H. Llewellyn Smith to Mr. Deterding. Dear Mr. Deterding, November 2'd, 1913. I HAVE not failed to bring before the Foreign Office and the Admiralty the various points urged by yon during the conversation which I had the pleasure of having with yon on Tuesday last. With regard to the question of the position of Sir Henry Babington Smith and the possibility of inducing him to reconsider his decision to retire from the Turkish Petroleum Company, I understand Sir Henry Babington Smith has informed the Foreign Office that his decision to retire is final and irrevocable, and that in all the circumstances of the case Sir Edward Grey is not prepared to reopen the matter. With regard to the possible effect of the retirement of the National Bank in increasing unduly the German influence in the joint undertaking, the loreign Office opinion is that, so far as regards the oil-fields of the vilayets of Mosul and Bagdad, the net result of a scheme such as that discussed between Herr Stanss and myself would he that the Deutsche Bank would have 25 per cent, of the capital of the new company, i.e., precisely her present share in the Turkish Petroleum Company. The Germans would, it is true, have an option if so desired on a certain proportion of the fuel oil, hut in view of what yon said as to the extreme uncertainty of any considerable surplus of oil fuel being available for export at least for several years, this cannot be considered to be a very important matter, and I am informed that neithei the I oreign Office noi the Admiralty take any objection to it. . . As regards oil concessions in other parts of the Turkish Empire, it will or course he clearly understood that in the present discussions His Majesty s Government are concerned exclusively with the question of oil in the two vilayets named, and that nothing that is now being arranged in any way prejudices the freedom of His Majesty s Government to give such support as they may think necessary to any existing or future British rights, claims, and interests in other parts of Turkey.6 I i ? h i j In view of these circnmstances he wished to know if the D’Arcy group did or did not wish to he the British nominees in this matter. ^ Mr Barnes also said that before attempting to answer that question the repre sentatives of the D’Arcy group might wish to know the conditions which H,s Majesty s Government would expert the group, if nominated, to fulfil, and read the following ] heads of conditions :— j rc x- fn ) Half the necessary capital must he subscribed by the group, and ettective steps mus^be taken for securing to the satisfaction of the Government that the voting ^'TfiT^oyoTotion profite'lf be^made out of the company to be formed for the pm pose o^workmgth^ wo^ed energetically) and the British group will be expected to p^ndertokm^ to this^effe^^ ^ Briti gh Government, if they so desire, a preferential right up to 40 per cent, of the fuel available for export. (e.) An option for a certain quantity to be reserved for the German Government should they 1801 ^ 681 ^ ^ Qf guch of j he higher employes of the company as are not Turkish to be nominated by the British group, and to be of British nationa ity. If the German Government should so demand, some of the higher employes to be of German nat 0^6 y^ relat i ons or wa r the directors representing the British group on the board of the new company to follow the guidance of His Majesty s Government in matters affecting Imperial defence. With regard to the first of these conditions, Mr. Greenway and Mr. Wallace pointed out that the existence of oil was not yet proved at all, and they suggested that, m the first instance, an exploration syndicate might be formed, the capital for which would be subscribed privately by the various parties. Should oil be found in paying quantities, a public company would be formed, and they suggested that any profit to the promoters should be taken by the promoters in the form of ordinary or deferred shares, debentures and preference shares being alone offered for public subscription. Ibis was the arrangement adopted by the Burma Oil Company m the flotation of the Anglo- Persian Company ; they quite recognise that any large cash payment by the company when formed to the promoters would be open to strong objection on the part ot His Majesty’s Government. . n With regard to the other conditions they raised no objection, and were evidently prepared to acquiesce. . , . n The discussion then reverted to the fundamental question of the division ot interests in the new company. Various suggestions were put forward ^ by the representatives of the D’Arcy group, as, e.g., for a geographical distribution of interests, and for pressure by His Majesty’s Government on the German Government to induce the Deutsche Bank to sever its'connection with the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company and co-operation by the two Governments to secure a concession for the Anglo-Persian Company and the Deutsche Bank jointly. The Board of Trade representatives pointed out that it appeared to them to be utterly impracticable to reach any arrangement other than that which had been outlined at the commencement of the meeting; that it was clear that Mesopotamian oil-fields could not be sterilised indefinitely; that the representatives of the D’Arcy group appeared to exaggerate the likelihood of a combination of the Deutsche Bank and the Anglo-Saxon against them ; and again urged that they should consider whether such an arrangement as was proposed would not in fact give them adequate protection if they had the chairmanship and were assured of the reasonable support of the Deutsche Bank, which we had reason to think would be given. Mr. Greenway inquired if the Deutsche Bank would be disposed to transfer any part of its voting power, though not necessarily of its financial interests, to the Anglo- Persian Company. Mr. Barnes and Mr. Stanley said that they thought this unlikely, and that it was not a request that could be urged. It appeared that the representatives of the D’Arcy group were extremely dissatisfied, but at the end of the conference Mr. Greenway expressed a strong desire to enter into direct communication with Dr. von Gwinner, apparently in the belief that he could obtain from that gentleman some more formal undertaking of support should the proposed company be formed. November 28, 1913.Enclosure 7 in No. 1. Minute by Mr. Ashley. IN consequence of Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith’s instructions I saw Herr Staus this (Iriday) morning at the Savoy Hotel, and had some informal conversation with him. With regard to the question of chairmanship, he repeated what he had said in his conversation at the Board of Trade and in his letter, that the Deutsche Bank would support the election of the first chairman from the D’Arcy group, and would, he thought, continue their support to such an election so long as the company was run in a satisfactory manner. If, however, the Anglo-Persian Company should use its control of the office of chairman to check unreasonably the development of the Mesopotamian field, he thought that His Majesty’s Government would feel that a change in the chairmanship would be reasonable. As regards the option for fuel oil, which must be limited to oil available for export, he thought it was certain that the German Government would want an option of some kind. He pointed out that his own concern, the Stearia Ramana, is already a large supplier to the Admiralty, and from the business point of view he would always be anxious to meet the Admiralty wishes. With regard to the question of staff, he thought that it would be reasonable for the Germans to claim a proportion equivalent to their share in the capital of the company. Herr Stauss further said that, as far as he himself was concerned, he saw no objection to the Anglo-Persian Company simply taking the place of the National Bank in the Turkish Petroleum Company but that he did not know how this proposal would commend itself to Mr. Deterding. He further stated that 30 per cent, of the holding in the Turkish Petroleum Company, which stood in the name of the National Bank was actually appropriated by M. Gulbenkian, an Armenian, who has from time to time acted as the financial agent in London. Herr Stauss thought that M. Gulbenkian s interest was a personal one, and not on behalf of the Turkish Government. Herr Stauss also told me, what we already suspected, that the Deutsche Bank was endeavouring to obtain the proposed Turkish petroleum monopoly, which apparently is being discussed by Djavid Bey amongst other matters at Berlin. Referring to the question of chairmanship, Herr Stauss mentioned that Mr. Deterding at one time had in mind the suggestion for a neutral independent chairman I then told Herr Stauss of Mr. Greenway’s desire to enter into communication with Dr. von Gwinner, and suggested that he might possibly care to meet Mr. Greenway, in which case I would inform Mr Greenway that Herr Stauss was in London and would be glad to have a talk with him. Herr Stauss, after some consideration, said that he thought that would be a desirable course, and suggested that Monday of next week would be a convenient time. He does not propose, I gather, to say anything to Mr. Deterding in the meantime, but should it appear, as a result of his conversation with Mr. Green way, that an arrangement seems possible, Herr Stauss would endeavour to arrange a conference of all three parties. _ A A I have since seen Mr. Greenway and told him that Herr Stauss is m one on an would be willing to see him. Mr. Greenway will communicate with Herr tauss ’ vvl _ a view to a meeting on Monday, and in the light of the discussions at t at mee mg wi consider the whole matter and let us have a final decision of his group. I gather that the present disposition is to drop the matter if they cannot get a more formal undertaking from the Deutsche Bank as to support t an, ^ the latter could be reasonably expected to give. But this may be an a i u e a op for purposes of negotiation. p ^ November 28, 1913. Enclosure 8 in No. 1. Minute by Mr. Ashley. I HAD some telephonic conversation to-day with Mr. Greenway, who had just come from a lengthy interview with Herr Stauss in which a 16 , .1 covered. Mr. Greenway said that Herr Stauss repeated what e ac ^ [1963 d—1]8 Board of Trade, that the Deutsche Bank could not dissociate itself from the Anglo- Saxon Company, whilst Mr. Greenway had explained to Herr Stauss that the Anglo- Persian group regarded something more than 50 per cent, as a sine qua non. He had ^ suggested to Herr Stauss that the Deutsche Bank should either give up to the Anglo- &lt;5 Persian group a small percentage of its holding (which Herr Stauss had told us it would not do) or induce the Anglo-Saxon Company to do so. Mr. Greenway appears to have said to Herr Stauss that, unless one or other of these alternatives were adopted, his group would not enter into an arrangement, and in that event His Majesty’s Govern ment might “ block ” the grant of any oil concession at all in Mesopotamia. P. A. December 1, 1913. Enclosure 9 in No. 1. Minute by Mr. Barnes. Mr. Stanley, I HAVE seen Sir Francis Hopwood to-day, and I told him that the D’Arcy group were unwilling to accept the 50 per cent, offered. He said, “ I know that already, for they all came to see me on Friday afternoon and were very huffy about it. I took the opportunity of pointing out to them that, if they continued in their present attitude, it might result in their being left out altogether, and that, if they were, they could not with any justice blame British diplomacy.” I asked him whether the Admiralty would have any objection if any means could be found by which the Anglo-Saxon Company could be eliminated. He said in reply, “We lead a very stormy life in our interviews with the c Shell.’ I always try to keep on good terms with them myself, because I feel we want their stuff.” He said that he could not be willing at all to see any step taken which might possibly risk an entire break with the “ Shell.” He said, “ They might be in a position some day to hold up the British Navy, and I certainly do not wish to quarrel with them, for we cannot be independent of them at present.” G. S. B. December 1, 1913. Enclosure 10 in No. 1. Sir H. Llewellyn Smith to Mr. Deterding. Dear Mr. Deterding, December 1, 1913. WITH further reference to your letter of the 24th November, I fear that I am not in a position to add materially to my previous letter. As regards the operations of the Turkish Petroleum Company in parts of Turkey outside the vilayets of Mosul and Bagdad, I have already explained that His Majesty’s Government must remain entirely free to take what action they may think British interests require as regards any claims to concessions in those districts. I he point you raise as to the parties interested in some of the shares of the Turkish Petroleum Company held by the National Bank of Turkey seems to me to be primarily a matter of internal concern for the consideration of the parties by which that company is constituted. The best way of avoiding the control of the new company being changed by purchase of shares in the open market is being carefully considered. I think that His Majesty’s Government, before taking part in such a conference as you suggest, would desire to be assured that it is in accordance with the wishes of all the interests concerned. In any case it would be an essential preliminary that we should know definitely whether or not the parties constituting the Turkish Petroleum Company are prepared in principle to join with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on the basis and for the purpose already indicated.

I saw Mallet in Paris ; he said that the Ottoman Bank expect a large increase of business herlTand will possibly consider the issue of further capital, of which some might he taken up in London, and gave me an assurance that Nias willingly assisted British enterprise here. An opportunity may arise shortly ot testing this assurance, as capital is required for Jackson’s barrage works, and if the National Bank refuses and the manager applies to me, 1 propose to ask the Ottoman Bank to assist. As to the prospects of a purely British bank here, the commercial attache thinks that there is certainly a field for legitimate banking business, and CrawTord is strongly in favour of the enterprise. He assures me that a British bank is greatly needed and would find plenty of remunerative business. . . Perhaps the best course would be to tell Sir John Jackson that Crawford is in the best position to give him information as to the prospects of a new bank, and that if^ he comes to an independent conclusion that such an enterprise would be remunerative, His Majesty’s Government would be pleased on every ground to see the bank established.

I HAD an interview of four Lours and a half with Hakki PasLa and Sassoon Effendi to-day. We went into various points about the naviga tion concession in considerable detail, notably in regard to customs, voting power, and drafting of the statutes, which they insist upon seeing before the concession is signed. They are already drafted and I have informed Lord Inchcape’s solicitors of their wish. Hakki Pasha then said that he had had a letter from Djavid Bey to say that the Germans re garded the Mesopotamian oil question as settled between German and British interests, but that he, Hakki Pasha, had reason to know that the question was far from being settled, for M. Gulbenkian held 15 per cent, of the National Bank’s shares, which holding had, he under stood, already been made over to the Shell Transport Company, in which the greater part of M. Gulbenkian’s fortune was already invested. The National Bank were not, therefore, free agents in regard to the whole 50 per cent, of their holding. I said I was much interested to hear this, and I asked him if M. Gulbenkian’s shares were not divested of voting rights, merely entitling that gentleman to a share in any ultimate profits. Hakki Pasha said that, so far as he was aware, no conditions had been made by M. Gulbenkian when transferring his rights to the Shell Company, but he begged that his remarks to me might be treated as confidential. Hakki Pasha asked me what was to happen if the Shell Company, or M. Gulbenkian, brought an action against the National Bank for an illegal transfer of some of their holding. I replied that I had no fears of any such contingency arising, since without such a transfer His Majesty’s Government would have paralysed, partially if not entirely, the operations of the Turkish Petroleum Company in Mesopotamia, since His Majesty’s Government disputed their title, holding that the Ottoman Government were pledged as regards the oil concession to [1287]I- I ■’f'M i Mr. D’Arcy. Hakki Pasha then said that His Majesty’s Government must bring great pressure to hear upon Mr. D’Arcy to accept a reasonable settlement, since, as regards the Mesopotamian concession, His Majesty’s Government were his creator, and everyone must respect their creator. I said that this line of argument appeared to me to he topsy-turvydom pure and simple ; the Shell were obviously trying to prevent a settle ment which it was hoped would reconcile British and German interests, and were doing so upon selfish and utterly unscrupulous grounds. They, however, overlooked the cardinal fact that the Turkish Petroleum Company at present only held rights which were entirely disputed by His Majesty’s Government, and indeed by the 1 urkish Government themselves, and there was no possibility whatever of the said rights being con firmed by the Ottoman Government unless with the consent of His Majesty’s Government, as to act otherwise would involve the complete break* down of the pending negotiations. His Majesty’s Government, however, would not give their con sent to the recognition of the Turkish Petroleum Company’s rights, or rather claims, unless Mr. D’Arcy’s claims, which appeared to them far stronger, were satisfied by an acceptable compromise. I am sending a copy of the above minute to the Board of Trade, and I will embody in separate minutes discussions I had about the Italians at Adalia and Rhodes, and matters relating to ratifications.

Sir E. Crowe to Sir H. Llewellyn-Smith. Dear Llewellyn-Smith, Foreign Office, November 13, 1913. SINCE our correspondence of the last two days a fresh factor has arisen respecting the Mesopotamian oil question. The German Charge d’A If a ires was here to day and stated that Herr Stauss, who is Herr von Gwinner’s partner and adviser in relation to oil matters, was at present in this country, and Herr von Kuhlmann suggested that perhaps someone from the Board of Trade and Foreign Office would care to take advantage of his presence to have an informal discussion about the Mesopotamian question. He added that Herr Stauss had great influence with Herr von Gwinner, and thaUany recommendation of the former would probably be accepted by the latter. Herr von Kuhlmann then said that, although Herr von Gwinner had expressed readiness to concede 1 per cent of his holding in the Turkish Petroleum Company to Sir E. Cassell, he would not, according to the statement of Herr Stauss, be prepared, now that the National Bank was going out, to make a similar concession in favour of Mr. d’Arcy, as that would mean permanent subordination to the latter. There were, however, several companies in which the capital was equally divided between two parties which worked well in practice, and, subject to a clear drafting of the statutes, there was no reason why this should not be the case with the Mesopotamian company. Herr von Kuhlmann stated that Herr Stauss’s opinion was that d’Arcy should receive 50 per cent, and the Deutsche Bank and the Shell 50 per cent, between them. He added that Herr Stauss was seeing Sir H. Babington-Smith and Mr. Detter- ding to-day or to-morrow. My former letters to you were based on what we distinctly understood to be the views of Herr von Gwinner, but, apparently, those views may be subject to modifica tion at the instance of Herr Stauss, and this is the fresh factor in the situation. Would you be in favour of a meeting, and if so would you prefer it to take place here or at the Board of Trade ? Herr von Kuhlmann added that the German Government were anxious that a settlement of this question should be reached. _ . I understand that you are considering the question of a^ meeting with Mr. Detter- ding. As he is to be a partner in the proposed company I think it would be inadvisable to risk offending him by not meeting him, but of this you must be the best judge. Herr von Kuhlmann further stated that he understood from Herr Stauss that the proposed petroleum monopoly in Turkey was for lamp oil, but this does not quite accord with Hakki Pasha’s statements. _ _ t • i -l ta * u He said the principal oil company in Roumania, connected with the Deutsche Bank, was desirous of getting the monopoly if possible. . „ If Herr Stauss comes to a meeting I think we should stand out, m the hrst instance, for 51 per cent, in the Mesopotamian concession, though we might perhaps eventually accept a bare 50 per cent. . In case any proposal is made to extend the area of the concession beyond the vilayets of Mosul and Bagdad we must of course not overlook the fact that we are committed to other parties in regard to the Farsan Archipelago and Syria. Yours sincerely, EYRE A. CROWE.

WITH reference to my letter of the 7th instant, on the subject of the Mesopotamian oil concession, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to suggest that a conference should he held, preferably at the Board of Trade, to discuss the present position, at which both Mr. Detterding and Sir H. Babington-Smith should be present as well as representatives of this Department. Sir E. Grey is, for political reasons, anxious that a settlement of this difficult question should, if possible, be reached by consent. It is the one outstanding matter between this country and Germany in Turkey in regard to which a compromise is not in sight, and, though it might be possible for a time to block the granting of the concession to German interests, it appears unlikely that it can be obtained exclusively for Mr d’Arcy. If the granting of the concession were blocked by the diplomatic action of His Majesty’s Government, not only would Mr. d’Arcy receive no advantage, but much friction would result. m n n ^ If the National Bank of Turkey withdraws from the Turkish Peti oleum Compan}, the arrangement which His Majesty’s Government should, according to the views which have hitherto been accepted as a basis in the departmental correspondence, aim at would be that a new company should be formed to work the Mesopotamian concession, in which the Turkish Petroleum Company would hold, say, 49 per cent, ol the shares, and Mr. d’Arcy 51 per cent. i • x-u + v Sir E.’ Grey regrets to say that he has been driven to the conclusion that such a proposal is foredoomed to failure, as it now seems clear that Herr von Gwmner and Mr. Detterding will not consent to a compromise upon such a basis In these circumstances it becomes incumbent upon His Majesty s Government to consider possible and acceptable alternatives, and it occurs to the Secretary of State that a satisfactory settlement might be reached on the following lines .

IN reply to yonr letter of the 13th October relative to a recent enquiry by Sir Reginald MacLeod as to the Mesopotamian oil concession, I am directed by the Board of Trade to state that having regard to the point which has now been reached in the discussion with Sir Henry Babington Smith, acting on behalf of the National Bank, it would, in their opinion, be inadvisable for any communication on the subject to be made by your Department to any of the other parties to the National Bank’s combination. I am to suggest therefore, for Sir E. Grey’s consideration, that Sir R. MacLeod might be informed that as discussion is proceeding with Sir H. Babington Smith, who represents the principal interests in the combination formed by the National Bank, it does not appear that any useful purpose would be served at the present time by separate discussion with the other parties thereto, especially as the National Bank will doubtless communicate to them any proposals which may appear to offer an acceptable basis for settlement. I am, &amp;c. GEO. J. STANLEY. [1908 q —2]&lt;+21.1 [This Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Gnram™ B w+ f MR. HERBERT LAWRANCE called on me yesterday, and I told him that the* hiational Bank had practically decided to leave Turkey, and that, before considering the question of setting up another bank in their place, you wished to know whether there was any likelihood of the British side of the Imperial Ottoman Bank taking over the National Banks assets. He said there was no division of interests in the Imperial Ottoman Bank. The committee was equally composed of French and British repre sentatives. What made the French interest more important was that nearly all the shares were held in France, and that the French public hallowed Turkish investments, whereas the English public would not look at them. He did not understand what we wanted, and never had been able to understand why we had established the National Bank in Turkey. It had not been able to induce the British investor to put money into Turkey, it had got no important concession, it had not competed with the Imperial Ottoman Bank in any way, nor injured their position. Its assets were quite unimportant. I said that what we had objected to in the past was the close co-operation of the Imperial Ottoman Bank with the Deutsche Bank and the exclusion of British participation in concessions. He maintained that concessions to British contractors were not of great importance, but said that if we attached importance to this point (and I said that we did) he would see if the Imperial Ottoman Bank could not establish Imperial Ottoman Bank, who had, moreover, advanced money to Pearsons for irrigation works and to Jacksons. He left in my mind the impression that it would be useless to attempt to establish another bank in Constantinople, as there would be no work for it to do, and we might be liable to reproach later on. He said that, even if a British group were formed to take over the assets of the National Bank and to work in co-operation with the Imperial Ottoman Bank, still the French financial interest would be immeasurably superior to the British. Before taking any final decision I might consult Huth Jackson, who wdl be m 1 V •• r • '■'&gt; ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. [July 4.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 14. [31358] No. 1 . Minute by Sir L.

I WRITE, as you requested at our meeting on the 10th September, for the purpose of stating the conclusions which we have formed as to the scheme indicated in your private and confidential letter of the 5 th September on the Mesopotamian oil question. We have given very careful consideration to the scheme, with every desire, I need hardly say, to meet the wishes of His Majesty’s Government. We find, however, that the conditions and restrictions proposed would render it extremely difficult to deal with the business—which, if it is successful, will require a large amount of capital— and we have come definitely to the conclusion that the only practicable course for the National Bank is to withdraw entirely. In my former communication with Sir Louis Mallet, I suggested that this with drawal should take the form of transferring the interest held by the National Bank of Turkey in the Turkish Petroleum Company to the Deutsche Bank and the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company. This would be the simplest form of withdrawal. We know that the Deutsche Bank and the Anglo-Saxon Company would have no objection to its adoption. We are, however, most anxious to arrange our withdrawal in the manner which His Majesty’s Government may consider most convenient, and m the course of my conversation with you I mentioned that there are two other methods which mig it lie adopted :—* 1. Transfer of the interest held by the National Bank in the Turkish Petroleum Company to any other person or group designated by His Majesty s Government. This course could not be adopted without the assent of our partners in the lurkis Petroleum Companv, since, as you are aware, under the statutes of that company, we are required to offer our shares to those partners before disposing of them to “'‘T Liquidation of the Turkish Petroleum Company For the purpose of deciding upon liquidation a three-fourths majority suffices \\ e should tlierelore. te . position to liquidate if jf e us D qf JkaraproLbi 0 thafthe'Deutsche Bank wmddTavJno objection to this solution, since they would resume possession of the rights which they have handed over to the Turkish Be roleunr^ probable, however, that the Anglo-Saxon Company won c if thevhad a strong we should naturally be reluctant to force such a couise upo , solution objection to it.

[41919] L l 9 St v [Amended Copy.] No. 1. Minute by Mr. Parker. SIR HENRY BABINGTON SMITH called to-day to see me with reference to the letter I had written to him on the 5th September about the Mesopotamian oil concession (see No. 39788). He told me that he had seen Sir E. Cassel this morning, and that the National Bank, while anxious to do whatever was possible to meet the wishes of His Majesty’s Government in the matter, found that the conditions proposed were such as to make it impracticable, from their point of view, to deal with the business. The Bank would therefore prefer to withdraw altogether. I asked him if he would explain to me in con fidence what the reasons of this attitude were. He replied that the reasons were, broadly, the hampering nature of the restrictions proposed, and the predominant position assigned to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. He would, in con fidence, mention some of the objections in detail:— ( 1 -) The National Bank were not enamoured of the methods of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, or its parent company the Burmah Oil Company, or of Mr. D’Arcy. If oil were found and the Mesopotamian oilfields were to be developed it would be necessary to raise millions of pounds, and they could not consent to be placed in a position in which they might be compelled to adopt a financial policy dictated by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. (I may mention that I have heard very similar criticism of the methods of the Burmah Oil Company from an independent but reliable source, and I understand that the Company is looked upon askance both in Glasgow and Liverpool, where most of, or at all events several of, the directors and promoters live.) (2.) It was almost impossible to accept a hard and fast marketing arrangement, when, say in ten years’ time, the conditions of marketing might entirely have changed. (3.) The condition about employing officials [1863 /c—3] Copy to Lnd 5 a 19 SEP 1913! /• / of the Anglo-Persian Company would certainly give rise to difficulty in practice; and would be likely to prevent the Company from employing the most efficient instruments for its purpose. Sir Henry Babington Smith then said that he had in his previous communication to Sir Louis Mallet proposed to transfer the interest of the National Bank in the Turkish Petroleum Com pany to the Deutsche Bank and the Anglo-Saxon Company. If His Majesty’s Government thought this undesirable, there were two other methods of withdrawal, which might be practicable :— (1.) The National Bank might go out and, by arrangement with the other two parties in the Turkish Petroleum Company, agree to transfer their interest, or part of it, to a nominee of His Majesty’s Government. His Majesty’s Govern ment could then, if they wished, hold this interest themselves through a nominee (such as the Bank of England or Messrs. Baring) or dispose of it as they thought best. The other partners would, he thought, not agree to a simple transfer of the interest to the Anglo- Persian Company. (2.) The Bagdad Railway interests and the National Bank might be able (though on this point he must refer to the statutes) and might be willing, to agree to dissolve the Turkish Petroleum Company, when the position would revert to what it was before the formation of the Company in 1912, viz., Mr. D’Arcy would have his claim, based on an oral promise of the Grand Vizier, and the Germans would have their claims, based on the convention of 1903 and the disputed convention of 1904. This course would depend on German acquiescence, and, as it would probably be regarded by the Shell (Anglo-Saxon Company) as prejudicial to their interests, the National Bank would not like to adopt it unless it were regarded by His Majesty’s Government as the only satisfactory solution. Sir H. Llewellyn Smith is away; but I under stand that he is to be in London on Monday and that a conference, if he thinks it desirable, may perhaps be possible. September 10 , 1913. A.

Babington Smith. (Private and Confidential.) Henry, ^ Foreign Office, September 5, 1913. , vl .^ r our approaching meeting to discuss the Mesopotamian oil question, I think it will help matters if I let you have, in writing, and for you private use, an outline of the views of Sir E. Grey, after full consultation with the Admiralty and the Board of Trade, respecting the Mespotamian oil concession. I write in this form of a private letter, because we cannot at this stage put forward anything definite or binding, and all which I write must be regarded as tentative and non-committal. Before putting forward the scheme indicated in this letter, I should like to emphasise two pointe : (a) the participation suggested for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in the capital of the proposed new concern is very much below what Mr. Greenvray, on behalf of the D’Arcy interests which His Majesty’s Government are pledged to support, is likely to be satisfied with, and that it is only subject to pressure on the part of His Majesty’s Government that he is likely to agree to it; and ( 6 ) His Majesty’s Government (and, there is reason to believe, the Ottoman Government) do not consider the title of the Turkish Petroleum Company to be very sound. That title consists in ( 1 ) certain rights, limited by the fact that they are expressly stated not to constitute “ a privilege or a monopoly,” and by the fact that they only extend for 20 kilom. on each side of the Bagdad Railway so far as that railway may pass through petroliferous districts, and ( 2 ) certain claims which rest upon the convention concluded by the Anatolian Railway Company with the Civil List in 1904. Nobody disputes the validity of the rights, limited as they are, under (1) : we have taken high legal advice, which shows that any rights conferred by the convention of 1904 have lapsed, and in any case you are aware that the validity of the rights derived under the convention of 1904 is disputed. I draw attention to these two points, (a) and (b), not in any contentious spirit, but because I do think that they should be borne in mind in considering the scheme which is now suggested. A clear preponderance of the capital of the company to be British, counting for this purpose the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the National Bank as British, but not the Anglo-Saxon Company; 52 per cent, would suffice for this purpose, of which not less than 27 per cent., and preferably more, should be Anglo-Persian. All the directors nominated by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the National Bank to be British subjects approved by His Majesty’s Government, and undertakings to be given by them and by the groups which they represent that in any time of war or strained relations they will obey any directions of His Majesty s Government m matters affecting Imperial safety and defence. The National Bank and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to undertake that they will not transfer their interest, or any part thereof, to any other parties without the previous approval of His Majesty’s Government, and that, in any event, it shall be a condition of transfer that the transferees shall come under the undertaking specified above a m ci tItcv+.i n op nr ran frement on the following lines to be concluded before the2 Kailway Company, and to market in Europe, and all other parts of the world not specified above. A further undertaking to be given in a binding forni that, in prospecting, and in the actual mining and manufacture of products, and in the selection of the local scientific and engineering staff, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company shall be treated on absolutely equal footing with the Anglo-Saxon Oil Company. The British Government to have an option to purchase up to 50 per cent, of the total output of fuel oil. The German Government to have a similar option up to 40 per cent, and the Turkish Government up to 10 per cent., the requirements of the Bagdad Railway Company to be included in the German or Turkish share, as may be arranged. I do hope that we shall be able to reach a settlement now of this very difficult question. ALWYN PARKER.r — 15 D0CTmemt 15 1116 ^gWHis Britannic MaiestV, •, '' i / ; 1 [B] ASIATIC TURKEY AND A RABIA.

A careful examination of the documents communicated by Herr von Kuhlmann, copy of which was enclosed in your letter under reply, relative to the Turkish Petroleum Company, confirms the Board in the opinion that the scheme set out in their letter of the 8 th August offers the best prospect of a solution satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government and acceptable to the various interests concerned. The scheme depends, however, largely upon the willingness of the National Bank to remain in the combination as a British concern, that is, under a pledge that in times of war or strained relations their representatives on the directorate of the concessionnaire company will act in accordance with the directions of His Majesty’s Government in matters affecting Imperial safety and defence, and that the bank will only transfer its interest or any part thereof in the concern to persons or bodies approved by His Majesty’s Government who would give a similar pledge.
