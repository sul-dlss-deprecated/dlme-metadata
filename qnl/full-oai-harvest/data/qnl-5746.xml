It chiefly comprises copies of the proceedings (in French) of the 128 through to the 170 meetings of the Council, with some omissions where meetings were of a purely administrative nature. The proceedings were forwarded by the British Ambassador at Tehran (Sir Walter Beaupre Townley; Sir Charles Murray Marling) to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Sir Edward Grey), and then forwarded by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to the Under-Secretary of State for India.The proceedings detail reports of epidemics such as plague, cholera and malaria, occurring in Persia, with recurring reports from Bouchir [Bushire], Enzeli [Bandar-e Anzalī], Astara [Shahrestān-e Āstārā]. The proceedings also document the measures taken to implement restrictions of movement, quarantine and vaccination programmes. Also in the file are reports on the proceedings made by Dr Anthony Richard Neligan, physician at the British Legation in Tehran, and the British representative at the meetings of the Tehran Sanitary Council.The part includes a divider which gives the subject and part number, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in that part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence (f 3).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Tehran Sanitary Council</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation to Tehran, Physician to</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bushire</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bandar-e Anzalī</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Shahrestān-e Āstārā</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Epidemics</topic></subject><subject><topic>Cholera</topic></subject><subject><topic>Plague</topic></subject><subject><topic>Bubonic plague</topic></subject><subject><topic>Malaria</topic></subject><subject><topic>Vaccination programmes</topic></subject><subject><topic>Quarantine</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000b0#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000b0#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
