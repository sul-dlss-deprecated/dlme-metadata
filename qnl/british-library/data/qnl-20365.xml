After respects, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt ol Your Excellency's telegram 110.67 which reached me last night, on the subject of the pilgrims from Hejd. This important matter was the subject of Major Marshall 's letter iro.84 M. of January 28th last, in which Your Excellency was informed that it was out of the Question for His Majesty's Government to bring any pressure to bear upon Ibn Saud to limit the number of Nejd pilgrims for yet another year. How many years now, at the personal request of His Hasimite Majesty, the people of Nej d have been prevented from performing this duty. I need not recapitulate the efforts and arguments employed by His Majesty's Government to encourage an amicable settlement of outstanding Questions between your Government and that of Ibn Saud. These endeavours to foster pacific relations within the Felnsula have nrever failed to meet with an obstacle in your Government's insistence that the matters at issue, be!ore they become the subject of any arbitration, should be prejudged. It is no exaggeration to describe this constant defermentof any attempt at direct and amicable negotiations with Ibn Saud asone of the most disheairtening features of present Arabian politics. TARY GI 1 STATIC ICR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ITS CCAI mention this political aspect of the subject because it is that which appears to add to this question of the Nejd pilgrimage sentiments and considerations extraneous to its exclusively religious character. I beg that you will believe that I am not writing these lines in a spirit of mere opposition or of patronising advice. The question is too big for quarrels and too important for words lightly-weighed. Is there any proof of the noble ideal of Arab unity greater than that it transcends all apprehensions and that it is inspired by considerations not regional but peninsular ? Are there boundaries so rigorous that they must stand between a Moslem and the sacred duty of the pilgrimage ? Compliment s ( Sgd) BVlr.Grafft ey-Smith H.B.M.VTCTi!

I do mot see that the importance of the matter is such as to cause you to take the trouble of writing a word of which you have written or of occupying your mind therewith, i'or we fear nothing but your blame and your objections if we take any steps in this concern. The object of bothering you with these questions is to guard against the occurrence of anything contrary to your clear obligations. As for the question of Ibn Saud, what wehave demanded about frontiers and such questions is solely for the life and the quiet of the country, that he should be turned back to the state he was in before. His Majesty My Lord has said: If this cannot be, then I am ready to abdicate in his favour, that he may take the country over, and it is obvious that I desirenothing but the interest of the country and its moral and material welfare to which you have referred in certain passages of your letter. This is because we know, truly and without doubt, the sentiments of the country and its susceptibilities, and your knowledge of our zeal for the country's interest from our saying that we are ready to abdicate in his favour should prove that the only object is to protect would-be Pilgrims of the Moslem wor -ld from the remarks which wenotice. Consider, Your Excellency, that he is in process of mobilising soldiery in a place called Al-Sakha, J.THT! BRITISH AGH5IT . JT5DDAH.250 kilometres distant from Mecca, and it is rumoured that he intends agression against the borders of the country. As for what you say about religion - behold the Persians and the Ismail is and the Abadis and the Zaidis -md their like of other tenets, and there is no doubt that the Wahhabis are naturally of their number as they were before. But the question has reached the stage q hostility and has taken that shape. Otherwise, before this hostility, the Wahhabis used to come from wherever they lived. There was room for them as for the other sects. Anyway, we did not prevent their pilgrimage, as is known from our accepting the people of their villages and territories last year and from the reception they met with at our hands on their arrival. But the Beduin, who have only adopted that creed for the purpose of loot, plunder and rapine. ... 1. This behaviour of theirs is what has created and established such hatred between the people of our country and them that the one cannot bear the sight of the other. From this you will see that our telegram is clear and devoid of self-interest. Herewith we confirm it, and this is simply from service to humanity.

They regard pilgrimage as an act of idolatfery and consider Mecca to be a sink of unspeakable iniquity. It would therefore be a pious act , according to their teaching , to remove a bacK- sliding brother from the danger of drinking coffee, committing idolat^ry , and becoming corrupted by Mecca., rphe temporal ruler of these extreme Reformers is the Sultan Abd-el-A^iz es~Saud ol Nejd , whose ancestor , Saud , was driven out of Mecca - which he had purged with fire and sword for ten years - by the great-grandfather of the present King of Egypt , in 1B12 .DRAFT- Political Residency, Persian Gulf.

I HAVE the honour to report that difficulties have risen again this year in connexion with the Egyptian Medical Mission which is annually sent to the Hejaz for the pilgrimage. 2. According to Sheikh Hafez Wahba, who is now here, the mission is rather more extensive than usual. He mentioned that there were eight doctors instead of four as last year, that the mission wished to have establishments at Jedda, Mecca and Medina, whereas formerly it used to establish itself onl3 T at Jedda and Mecca, and, after the Mecca pilgrimage, move with such pilgrims as went to Medina. More motor ambulances were with the mission, which also wished to fly the Egyptian flag. Ibn Saud, irritated by Egypt's refusal to recognise him, objected to this enlargement of the Egyptian Medical Mission. 3. According to Dr. Shahin Pasha, Under-Secretary of State for Public Health, the various objections of the Hejaz Government were discussed with the Hejaz agent here. It was agreed that the mission should fly the sanitary instead of the Egyptian national flag. Permission was given to the whole mission to proceed, except to the motor ambulances. Further negotiations on this point are continuing. Dr. Shahin added that Nahas Pasha had sent a message just before his departure to England to the Hejaz agent, suggesting that these difficulties were being raised owing to the non-recognition of Ibn Saud by Egypt and assuring him that the Egyptian Govern ment, on the return of the delegation from England, would tackle this larger question in the most sympathetic spirit. 4. I suggested to Sheikh Hafez Wahba that Ibn Saud was ill-advised to translate his resentment at his own non-recognition into the realm of pilgrimage relief. Such action would help the adversaries of recognition, who would have little difficulty in exploiting this obstruction in a sense unfavourable to Ibn Saud. Hafez Wahba agreed, and said that he had already telegraphed to the Amir Faisal at Mecca, urging that it was not worth while making difficulties about the Egyptian Medical Mission^ 5. The Sheikh expressed indignation at the tone of the press, inspired by the Palace. The ' Ittehad,' ' La Liberte ' and the ' Ahram ' have, indeed, published some extremely offensive articles about the difficulties being made by the Hejaz Government over this mission. I have, &amp;c.

NO sooner was the 1928 pilgrimage concluded than the political horizon began .o cloud over, and omens appeared which boded ill for the pilgrimage of 1929. 2. The first of these was the death of the King's father, Abdurrahman-el- Feisal-al-Saud immediately after the Haj, an event which, in the nature of things,, threatened to give rise to domestic trouble and internal strife. It was feared that :he King's brother, the Emir Mohammed, who was in a position to exercise 2onsiderable influence over certain powerful tribes with whom he was connected by :ies of relationship, might revolt. The King, however, showed wisdom and tact in iealing with the situation, and there were no untoward developments. 3. Trouble of a serious nature was brewing nevertheless and culminated in the ^khwan revolt under Feisal-ed-Doweish, Ibn Bujad and other powerful leaders vho did not see eye to eye with the King over matters of policy, and who interpreted ;he inauguration of new measures of reform on the part of the King as being 'adically opposed to their traditions and religion. 4. All measures taken to effect a compromise or a reconciliation proved msuccessful, and there ensued a period of anarchy in Northern Arabia which might lave been disastrous to the pilgrimage had its true dimensions become generally mown to the outside world. 5. The King's victory over the rebels at Sabilla in March 1929 settled matters : ot the time being. Had the result been different, the lives of many of the pilgrims night possibly have been in danger. 6. Other factors tending to reduce the number of pilgrims were the failure of -he rice crop in Java, and the dullness of the rubber market in Malaya. Some U,429 pilgrims only came from Java, Malaya and China as compared with 49,394 n 1928. The number of pilgrims from Malaya this year was extremely low, being mly 1,455 as compared with 12,184 and 4,418 in the years 1927 and 1928 respectively. The revolt in Afghanistan, as well as the communal riots in Bombay which broke )ut simultaneously with the advent of the pilgrimage season, were to a certain extent [21133] e Is Iresponsible for the decrease in the number of Afghan, and for the comparativdj small number of the Indian, pilgrims who arrived. Nevertheless these last showed an increase of 1,000 over the previous year s figures. The North African pilgrmu also came in larger numbers. Egypt, however, showed the greatest increase, having sent nearly 4,000 more pilgrims than in 1928. , . 7. The total number of pilgrims who came by sea was 85,051, a iigure which is nearly 15,000 less than that of the previous year. „ . , . OA 8 The number of pilgrims arriving from the interior of Arabia was 80 per cent, less than in 1928. This may be ascribed in great measure to the revolt m iNejd and to the fact that the Government itself considered it inadvisable that the more fanatical tribes should come to Mecca for the Haj m any large numbers, Precautionary measures were accordingly taken by the Government and the smal number of pilgrims who did come from the interior were disarmed at the outposts, The decrease in the number of the Nejdi pilgrims, however, was to the advantage of the other pilgrims, as these turbulent tribesmen, mounted^ on their camels, had in former years trampled down numbers of helpless pilgrims in the bazaar of Muna. 9. ' Taken all'round, the pilgrimage for 1929 may be reckoned a successful one, both as regards the number of pilgrims who attended and as regards the sanitary ami other arrangements made. 10. 'Haj ' day fell on Saturday, the 18th May. The weather was moderatelj cool except on the first day in Arafat, but a heavy shower of rain which fell there oi that day brought some relief. The Hejaz Government had provided a few trouglis between Mecca and Arafat for the supply of free water, and had also erected woodei sheds in which the pilgrims could rest. The wells and the water reservoiri constructed by the ' Nehr-i-Zubaida Committee' also proved of great benefit to tk pilgrims. In Jedda, as both the condensers were in proper working order, arrangements for water were entirely satisfactory. 11. The medical arrangements at Muna were good; those at the Centra! Hospital in Mecca, however, showed little or no improvement on last year. Ont feature of the general arrangements deserving of praise was the system by whkl persons suffering from sunstroke were taken in motor-buses from the desert plains of Arafat and Muna to Mecca for medical attention. Measures introduced for tb removal of pilgrims who died on the road were also effective. 12. The road between Jedda and Mecca was in a very bad condition in spited repairs undertaken last year. The project to lay wire netting along the sandiest stretches of the road did not materialise. 13. Arrangements for the recovery of the personal effects of deceased pilgrii were most unsatisfactory. Last year certain regulations were introduced which! was hoped would ensure their safe custody. Unfortunately, the result was quite tk contrary, and money and personal effects frequently disappeared. The mutawwifi (pilgrim guides) resumed their old practices of presenting to the Bait-el-Mal i fraction only of the personal estate of pilgrims dying in their charge. 14. The proposal made last year to regulate the exercise of the profession o mutawwif was not pursued. 15. The shipping arrangements were on the whole satisfactory. The Nemazfl Line, however, gave ground for complaint, as their returning pilgrims were detainei for many days while their ships waited in harbour for a full complement o passengers. The different shipping companies bringing pilgrims did not accep during the season return tickets other than those of their own company. This, ai usual, resulted in the enforced detention of pilgrims, a detention which, as has be' said before, can only be avoided if the system of compulsory deposits in India introduced. 16. The number of destitute Indian pilgrims repatriated amount to 139. would have been smaller but for the facility existing of using the land route throug! Nejd. 17. Under the conditions prevailing it was easy, setting aside the question security, for pilgrims to come by boat from any port on the coast near Karachi on the eastern side of the Persian Gulf, to enter Nejd and to proceed thence tol Hejaz. The majority of the Indian pilgrims, who afterwards figured as destitutes, came by this route. 18. The poorest section of the pilgrims were undoubtedly the Nigerians other West Africans, known under the general heading of Takrunis. From th$ the Hejaz Government derives no financial gain, and they are considered rather a an unwelcome burden. To use the words of the King : ' They are obnoxious inti 1 Haram, and occupy a large amount of space in the already congested accommodatio' of ft m regul the}' infl pens pilgi upoi whicl 'i miser to be repat raisec repat: tat, a ten 2 tains oiki i c menti matte ml and.

As a matter i last J of fact, though, these Takrnni pilgrims are a blessing to the Hejaz Government, cait being essential to the smooth working of the machinery of the pilgrimage. No rease regular labour is available in the Hejaz; as soon as the Takrunis set foot m Jedda, they busy themselves in carrying the luggage of other pilgrims and assisting them ^ in various other matters in connexion with transport. Especially are they indis pensable in Mecca for the supply of water, which, without them, would for many Has pilgrims be well-nigh impossible to obtain. ... t t t j evoli 19. These unfortunate Takrunis, despite their utility, are everywhere looked hat [ upon with contempt and subjected to humiliation. After the Haj, in oraer to collect raer money for their return tickets, they try to obtain employment of some kind or another, nVi and if they are unsuccessful they lead a pariah existence in Jedda, often for months teflon end. This time, however, those who passed through Suakin were compelled by r ;. the Nigerian and the Sudan Governments to purchase return tickets, and it is due .to this that Takruni destitutes who appealed to the British agency for assistance rr fuin obtaining their return passages were considerably fewer than in previous years. lf , 'The scheme at present under the consideration of the Nigerian and Sudan Govern- ;meuts for the control of the West African pilgrimage, would, if carried through, 1 go a long way, it is thought, towards ameliorating the unfortunate conditions under pn which the Takunis perform the pilgrimage. I ], 20. Afghan destitute pilgrims numbered sixty-five, and they were m a f miserable plight after the pilgrimage. The Turkish representative, though claiming Ao be in charge of Afghan interests, refused to disburse any money for their repatriation. The richer merchants of Jedda, however, took pity on them, and e k rr fraised a fund by private subscription in order to repatriate them. They were , repatriated by the Mogul Line, nominally at the expense of the Jedda merchants, o'but, as a matter of fact, Messrs. Turner Morrison made no charges; for this they deserve all praise. , „ 1 , . „ 21. No Moslem ruling chief visited the Hejaz this year. A few lesser chiet- ^ ' :ains of the Hadramaut, who generally rejoice in the title of ' Sultan, came on rilorimage. Among others, the Emir of Jaalan (Muscat) is perhaps worth ^ eser: mentioning. The Emir of Jaalan busied himself to some extent v^itn political liiiffl.natters, and with establishing a friendly relationship with the King. A | ar § e lumber of better-class Indians, including high officials, barristers, landlords 'find merchants came on pilgrimage. A notable Syrian who came was the Emir tks^hekib Arslan, the notorious Nationalist. He was entertained as a Royal guest, ind accommodation was arranged for him with the Acting Minister for Foreign is6(l HVffairs. icedi 22.' This year, again, there was no Moslem conference at Mecca. His Majesty svasq%he King performed the opening ceremony in connexion with the Holy Carpet of e ffiuthe Ka'aba in the presence of all the notable pilgrims of different nations and sects. kit-el-His Majesty also gave a banquet which was attended by over 400 of these pilgrims, who thus had the opportunity of exchanging views and also of being introduced to pnMhe King and of meeting the higher State officials. This banquet may perhaps be -egarded as a substitute for the Moslem Conference. Thefe 23. As in 1927 and 1928, no ' Mahmal ' was sent this year from Egypt. Ihe veredfHoly Carpet was prepared at Mecca, as in the previous year, by Indian weavers iDple®ander an Indian manager, himself working under the direction of M. Mohammed [d not Ismail Ghaznavi. A dispute between the manager and the weavers resulted m the qy , I mprisonment of a few of the workers. A party of these latter came to Jedda in a i, as Poverty-stricken condition, complaining of not having received the money for their s in Return passage, nor even certain arrears of salary due to them. Some of them were repatriated as destitutes. . . . • i i lt to If 24. The Egyptian Government, as usual, sent a medical mission, but it had a ro ute%reat many difficulties to contend with owing to the obstructive attitude of the Hejaz. mthorities. . i u i, • u e quest 25. As regards revenue, custom dues on articles arid goods brought m by r Kataoilgrims, produced about the same amount as in the previous year, but much gain ^resulted to the Government by the raising of the Kushan tax levied on pilgrims who 3S desttravelled to Medina by car. 26. The comparative abundance of motor-buses and keen competition among U^fiaEhe several motor companies caused the rate of transport between Mecca and Medina W.o drop from £15 to £9, inclusive of the Government's ' Kushan. This, however, r3 t;vhile making the journey to Medina easier for large numbers of the poorer pilgrims, Jgioit: [21133] ' b 2 , c o#did much harm to trade generally. Nearly 60 per cent, of the goods stored by merchants in Mecca and Jedda for the pilgrimage season could not be sold, as a great many pilgrims went on to Medina immediately and had no money on their return for disbursement in the country. The Government is likely to be a loser on this account, as the merchants will probably import considerably less goods for the 1930 pilgrimage, and there will be a corresponding diminution in the customs receipts in respect of general merchandise. Some compensation may, however, be forth- coming from increased importation of grain, as the Government has instructed traders in Nejd to buy this commodity in the Hejaz itself, despite the fact that grain coming from India, the principal country of origin, takes ten days only to reach Nejd ,by way of the Persian Gulf, as against twenty days, involving so much increased freight, when it is imported via Jedda. This is perhaps intended to enrich the Hejaz at the expense of Koweit. (2.)— Statistics.

Pilgrims of all classes again complained vociferously of the formalities to which they were subjected at Kamaran. Their complaints generally related to the following points :— (a) Disembarkation. —Women and children, as also weak or sick persons, are )tl exposed to the sun in lighters which are unprotected by any sort of Til awning. As a matter of fact the same thing occurs in Jedda, brk ® possibly as it is the pilgrims' first impression of the Holy Land, this is 311 not made a subject of complaint. 31 (b) Transfer from Quay to Quarantine Station. —Pilgrims have stated that they have to traverse the distance, about a quarter of a mile, over hot sand in i the sun, and that this involves hardships for their women and children. (c) Baths. —Objection has been raised against the present system of compulsory 4 baths whereby all pilgrims without any sort of distinction, except for the few who choose to hire a special bathroom at a cost of 5 rupees, have to hi bathe together in one big hall. Better class pilgrims or those who have a greater sense of cleanliness seem to object to bathing wdth lower class and i dirtier pilgrims. It would not, however, appear possible to provide an 521 alternative unless pilgrims are prepared to pay for the luxury of a - separate bathroom. i Similarly, the women have to take their bath together wrapped only in a short lungi. Protests were received to the effect that this offended Mahometan conception of decency and sense of purda, and that it was highly resented. It is complained that the bath given entails risk to the pilgrims' health, and is thought to have given rise to protracted disorders from i which pilgrims suffer occasionally after leaving Kamaran. It is stated g that pilgrims have to wait for some time in the open cdr after leaving the 21i bathing room, dressed only in wet lungis, while they search for their clothes, which are thrown in heaps on the ground after disinfection, ll Strong objection has been raised to the mixing of clothes of better 31 class pilgrims with those of less cleanly and lower class pilgrims. This, 221 apart from other and more obvious objections, is stated to cause incon- l'|| venience to pilgrims when they attempt to identify their clothing after 701 the bath. The arrangements for disinfection were criticised also on the ground that only such clothing as the pilgrims have on their persons is 0 disinfected, whereas the entire luggage, other dirty clothes, bedding, &amp;c., j'^l which they leave on board ship, are ignored. (d) Food Supply at Kamaran. —The food-stuff generally sold in the market is said to be of inferior and unwholesome quality, ggj (e) Thefts of Pilgrims'' Belongings. —Complaints were also received of pilferage alleged to have been committed on board ship during the absence of the ngji pilgrims in the quarantine camp. Furthermore, passports, return tickets and money are said to have been taken or lost when the pilgrims' clothes were removed for disinfection. , jt;: Since the introduction of compulsory vaccination and inoculation among the , Javanese pilgrims these do not land at Kamaran, and their ships stay there for a few ^ jj hours only. British subjects take it amiss to see a Javanese pilgrim ship leavingbefore their eyes, within a few hours of her arrival, while they are still subjected to the inconvenience of the quarantine regulations. . • ^ I understand that a suggestion has been made that previous inoculation and vaccination should be made compulsory for Indian pilgrims, and that if is were so it might be possible to dispense with their visit to Kamaran altogether. To cut out this visit completely would only aggravate the pilgrims troubles m Jedda, as the Heiaz Government would then, especially m the case of an epidemic breaking out on board ship, apply their own regulations and relegate the pilgrims to the quarantine island outside Jedda, where they would fare greatly worse than at Kamaran. The quarantine doctor's partiality for alcoholic refreshment which he takes at leisure on board ship, before declaring the ship free, has already formed the subject of remarks. One result is that the Indian pilgrimage officer is often kept waiting alongside the pilgrim ships for prolonged periods before he can begin his work This is regrettable in many ways, for it is important that he should get into touch with the pilgrims and interrogate them before their attention is distracted by the presence of the large number of dhowmen, &amp;c., who, under the existing regulations, board the ship at the same time as Munshi Ihsanullah himself. Representations are being made to the local authorities on this score. (B.) Tor. The total number of pilgrims who landed at the Tor Quarantine Station in 1929, on their return from Mecca, was 29,358, the largest number since 1908, when oU,429 pilgrims were disembarked. „ „ i.i p ^ -i 2. Judging by the statistics, the general state of health oi the pilgrims detained at Tor in'1929, though satisfactory, compares unfavourably with tha^t of the pilgrims who passed through Tor in the two preceding years. It is dimcult to attribute any reasons for this, especially in view of the fact that the climatic conditions ruling in the Hejaz in 1929 were more favourable than m organisation of the sanitary services more efficient. It can only be assumed that the standard of physical fitness of the pilgrims who visited this country in 1929 was lower than usual and they were in consequence more prone to infection. (4.)— Health. Small-pox was the only disease which assumed epidemic proportions during the pilgrimage season, and that only during the months of March and April. The number of deaths from small-pox is believed to have amounted to 250, of wnom seventy were Javanese, the remainder being Nigerians and Bedouins. The Hejaz official reports are, however, remarkably reticent on the subject of deaths from tnis cause. Comparatively few Indians suffered from the disease. Among the victims was the Prime Minister of the Maldive Islands; also one of the Indian clerks attached to the British agency. , , • j u 2. The Hejaz authorities viewed the outbreak of small-pox with considerable alarm owing to the presence of the Nejdi and Yemeni pilgrims who were not vaccinated. When the fact was known that an Indian steamer, ' Zayani,' wmcn arrived on the 18th April, had a case of infection on board, a proposal was made that all pilgrims should be compulsorily vaccinated on landing at Jedda. This proposal, however, was not carried into effect, but a system of voluntary vaccinatioB was introduced instead. It was widely advertised and a number of Hejazis and others took advantage of it. The lymph was locally prepared and supplied free to all medical practitioners. . 3. No effective means were taken to segregate infected persons and it was onl} due to the fact that the hot season had set in in full force before the majority of the pilgrims had reached the country, that the epidemic did not assume greater proportions. The Hejaz Government attempted to fix on the Javanese the blame for having introduced the disease. 4. Dysentery and its kindred troubles are endemic in the Hejaz. This can be accounted for by the system of storing water in cisterns which are never cleaned out. by unhygienic latrines which are never disinfected, and by meat and other food whicli is exposed to fly-borne infection. Dysentery was responsible for the largest mortality among the pilgrims causing 400 out of a total of 700 deaths. The Indians were particularly susceptible to it. A large percentage of the Indian pilgrims sufferedv from malaria. Fortunately, however, fatal cases were few. Pneumonia, bronchitis, , ai1 - fever and colds were also prevalent among the pilgrims; in many cases these illnesses ^ were stated by the pilgrims to have been contracted during the quarantine stay at % Kamaran. quaia Mortality. ^ A percentage of 6 per cent, or 880 deaths were reported among the Indian tb! an( ^ ^- a l a y pilgrims, whereas in the case of the Javanese the Dutch vice-consul e p tr reported that as many as 10 per cent. died. As regards the Indians, the largest r l: percentage of deaths occurred among the Bengalis. A large proportion of the tinv B en g a .li pilgrims were, however, of an advanced age. At Muna itself the death rate i was high, most of the deaths being as usual due to sunstroke. The total number of deaths during the four days' stay at Muna and Arafat, was, however, in the official regit report declared to be only 241 in 100,000. Mat® 6 The temperature in the shade at Muna was 115 degrees as against 124 degrees in the preceding year. The majority of pilgrims were accommodated in low, thin canvas tents, a meagre protection against the intense heat. The poorer class of pilgrims could not even afford such shelter and wandered about in the heat in search of food and water, thus falling an easy prey to sunstroke. Many succumbed Mill on their way to the mosques for the mid-day prayers or when proceeding to offer Ml sacrifices or to perform other similar rites, others while wande'ring in search of their companions. he pil^r nth tk 3 diet Sanitary Conditions {General). ^ ^ 7. Other factors conducive to illness were as follows : The average pilgrim, it at any rate 80 far as tlie Indian pilgrims are concerned, does not bring to the Hejaz if su ffi c i ent funds to admit of his hiring decent accommodation. Most of the pilgrims lD l - are allotted dark, dingy and unsanitary houses where they are packed together m small, dirty rooms. Proper latrines in the houses do not exist in sufficient numbers and human excreta and water drain into and accumulate in a common soak-pit beneath the ground floor; no attempt is ever made by the landlords to disinfect it or clean it out, and a foul odour persists round the houses polluting the whole atmosphere. 3 duril 8. The Government has so far done nothing towards building public lavatories, kpril Pilgrims who, for want of house accommodation at Muna, camp in the streets have 0 ) of i no other lavatory but the streets themselves, and consequently the stench within Thel yards of any wall is almost overpowering. Such efforts as are made to clean the as froi streets and congested areas where the pilgrims reside are entirely inadequate. In ^Tit' fact the Hejaz officials appointed to look into the question of pilgrim housing idianct accommodation were most lax in carrying out their duties, and the local Government is greatly to blame for allowing such a state of affairs to exist, consifc 9- The pilgrims themselves, however, were not entirely blameless. In many loW ere cases they failed to observe the commonest rules of health and sanitation. For rani,'« instance, although a special enclosure had been railed off for the slaughter of animals, jjwas 11 pilgrims occasionally took advantage of the local officials' laxity and slaughtered edda. • the i r a nimals wherever they happened to be, subsequently leaving the remains to vacciB ; decompose in the immediate vicinity. The intense heat the sun alone saves the gejazis Hejaz from outbreaks of serious epidemics every year from this cause. plied fr litfas( Water Supply. joritytf 10. At Jedda there was no difficulty in obtaining water as the output of the two gtf condensers was sufficient to meet the demand. The highest price reached did not 3e the exceed 6 annas per tin of 4 gallons. 11. The water supply at Mecca was also sufficient, the prices varying from 2 to ThisCJi 5 annas per tin. At Arafat and Muna, however, where the demand was heavy and c j eaI1 fi water carriers were not available in adequate numbers, the price rose to 12 annas jfooi 1 Pe r tin. There was no lack of water, however, for those who were prepared to pay ! eg t# the required price. At Arafat a new well was built by a generous Mecca merchant [ndia^ f t a cost £1 5 200; this was a great boon to the pilgrims. The Government also pims ^ j ne 1 w w ells both at Muna and Mozelfa, and in addition six reservoirs were erected where free water was distributed to the poor.8 Relief Measures at Mecca, Muna and Arafat. 12. The Heiaz Government maintain a central hospital at Mecca with branches in each quarter of the town. It was, however, of no great value to the pilgrims as it was inadequately equipped and understaffed. The medical officers employed were with two exceptions Syrians. Besides being unqualified and inexperienced, these men appeared to be far more anxious to enrich themselves than to anord relief to the pilgrims. Thev were unsympathetic in their treatment, and charged high fees to outside patients. &lt;? j x j 13. Arrangements were made by the local Government tor doctors and tents to be stationed along the road from Mecca to Arafat. Each tent was provided with a large canvas cistern containing water which was available for the relief of passers-by. The arrangements made for the removal of pilgrims suffering from sunstroke were good. Lorries carrying medical staffs patrolled different areas picking up cases of illness and conveying them to the nearest first-aid station, after which they were transferred to the central hospital in Mecca. Covered cars were supplied to remove the dead. 14. The Egyptian Government was the foremost in providing medical aid for their pilgrims. They keep up a large and well-equipped dispensary at Mecca and Medina, and field hospitals were also brought for the season and functioned at Jedda, Mecca, Muna and Arafat. Two ambulances were imported to attend to the pilgrims at Muna, but the local authorities forbade their circulation. Government of India Dispensaries. 15. The agency doctor reports that the total number of Indian pilgrims who attended the agency's dispensary was 1,882 at Jedda and 934 at Mecca, and that apart from pilgrims he treated 8,460 cases among resident Indians and other British subjects between the 24th January and the 15th July. The table given below gives a rough percentage of the different cases treated in the Indian dispensary :— Medical. (1) Malaria and its complications ...

The Indian doctor is considerably handicapped when at Muna and Arafat by the fact that, as things are at present, he, as also the Indian vice-consul, is coni- pelled to encamp in an out-of-the-way and unfrequented locality. Although pilgrims may know of the existence of the dispensary, they experience great difficulty in finding it. It is very necessary that the tents both of the Indian doctor and of the9 Indian vice-consul should be pitched in a conspicuous and accessible locality and ik., signboards erected to advertise their presence to the passers-by. At Muna the only suitable place is in the main thoroughfare, which the pilgrims traverse while on ilov^ their way to prayers. The houses at Muna are not only in a wretched and unsanitary Qcedcondition, but the rentals demanded are exorbitant (an ordinary house cannot be eli e fj leased for less than £100 for three days). It is therefore suggested that in future ioU an open space be hired on the main thoroughfare at a cost for the season of anything c 1 up to £30 for the dispensary and for the Indian pilgrimage officer. ^ Dispensary Staff. P as ^ . . .1 • U • i 'trobi 17. This year the Government of India supplied a military sub -assistant ip case surgeon and the Government of the Straits Settlements a dresser, who worked m they? conjunction with the Indian doctor. This is not an ideal arrangement, and it may 1 tor® become necessary to make other recommendations in this connexion (see also observa- tions below, under the heading of the Malay pilgrimage, regarding the appointment calaii of a Malay dresser). Meccs 18. It has been represented to me by the agency doctor that it would be pre- latJi ferable that a private assistant surgeon (M.B.B.S.) should be engaged instead of a lepik sub-assistant surgeon as hitherto, and that, if this is not found possible, an older : and more experienced sub-assistant surgeon might be selected for the post. In either case it should be clearly brought home to possible incumbents that at least seven hours' daily work will be demanded of them, and that they are debaned from engaging in private practice, igriii 19 x) r Muzaffar Ali, who was in charge of the Government of India thatf dispensary, performed his duties with zeal, and his services were of great value to ier ^ the pilgrims. I itreate (5.)— Transport. The year 1929 showed a considerable increase in the number of motor vehicles used. The total is said to have reached a thousand. Comparatively few touring cars were available, as, owing to their smaller carrying capacity, and to the tact that they pay the same kushan tax and mutawwif's commission as lorries, their use leaves but little margin of profit for the owners. Consequently, even the better-class and wealthier pilgrims had in most cases to travel in motor lorries. In many cases those who had secured cars for Medina could not, even by paying a higher rate, obtain cars for their return journey, and had to put up with all the inconveniences of a journey by lorry. There were frequent complaints on this account, and it was rarely possible, unless strong representations were made by the Indian pilgrimage officer himself, to obtain a refund of the difference between the car and lorry fares. In some cases, however, the motor owners concerned blamed the Government and proved that their cars had been commandeered. In other cases, when pilgrims were detained in Medina for lack of transport, motor companies were obliged to send cars to Medina to fetch their respective pilgrims. • i u 2. Complaints in connexion with transport were also concerned with the following points:— (1) Motor Accidents. —Several reports were received of the overturning of motor buses, resulting in some cases in deaths. Among the British pilgrims, several Indians were seriously hurt, although there were no deaths among these. The accidents were mainly due to the incompetence ot drivers and to reckless driving. (2) A rabias (a form of conveyance used between the outskirts of Mecca and the pilgrims' quarters).—Motor cars are not allowed to enter the pilgrims' quarters at Mecca, but are obliged to halt at a point anything from a mile to 2 miles distant from them. The pilgrims have to hire arabias to carry their families and luggage for the remaining distance. The rate aI1 (lAri 0 f hire i s exorbitant, ranging from £1 to £2, or even more during the gill, is 5 rush period. 0 ^ The frughan System at Mecca.—tof a period of a fortnight immediately at(# 1 : succeeding the Haj—that is, during the rush period—the existing [21133] c10 arrangements for issuing the kushans are entirely inadequate. The pilgrims have to wait for long hours at the Kushan Onice, and money is often extorted before they are allowed to take their turn. It is proposed to take up this matter with the local authorities with a view to inducing them to issue the kushans beforehand to the motor companies, thus avoiding the delay caused at the Kushan Office. j j * (4) The arrangements for the examination of cars at Jedda prior to their departure for Medina often involved the pilgrims in considerable delays; they were sometimes kept waiting for as long as twenty-four hours before the final formalities were completed. The motor companies were also guilty of delays in despatching their cars, and in many cases the inter vention of the police had to be sought. A certain Syed Siraj Wali, who besides being the owner of a motor company is also a mutawwif for the Malabaris and for certain other Indian pilgrims, was one of the chief offenders. (5) Over-chaTging on Fares by Mutawwifs. —The local authorities were induced to make a regulation to prevent the mutawwifs, who possessed cars for hire, from charging the pilgrims a higher rate than that allowed by the Government. This regulation, unfortunately, was allowed to lapse, as is often the case with regulations in the Hejaz. Representations to the Qaimaqam and to the police were, however, to some extent successful in redressing grievances. (6) Refund of return Motor-hire in respect of Pilgrims who died at Medina.- The local Bait-el-Mal makes no attempt to collect the return half of the motor fare of pilgrims who die at Medina when it takes over the estates of such pilgrims. Steps are being taken with the Hejaz authorities to protect the estates of deceased pilgrims in this respect. 3. The Saudieh Motor Company and a few influential persons, finding them selves unable to withstand the competition of other motor companies and to make a profit, approached the King in order to obtain the enactment of a law regulating motor traffic. In consequence, a ' Nakaba (a committee for the control of the motor traffic) was appointed, and the motor service thus came under the direct control of the Government. All journeys were booked through the ' Nakaba,' and the motor companies could only obtain pilgrims in their turn. This put an end to the competition prevailing, and the pilgrims had to pay maximum fares and be content to travel by any car or lorry, good or bad, which happened to be available at the time. To meet the expenses of the ' Nakaba,' a tax of 2 piastres for Mecca and 8 piastres for Medina was imposed, per passenger, on the motor service companies. 4. The mutawwifs lost much of their brokerage through the constitution of the 'Nakaba.' They were therefore anxious to abolish it. Finding no other pretext available, they gave a religious colouring to their persuasions, and, quoting the example of the Prophet Mohammed, urged that the Haj performed by camel secured greater merit in the eye of God, than if performed by car. The pilgrims were easily duped, and resumed travelling by camel in large numbers. The diminution in the number of persons travelling in motor vehicles affected Treasury receipts, and the Opposition party, seeing their chance, took the matter to the King, with the result that the Royal decree establishing the ' Nakaba ' was, as an excep tional measure, rescinded. The motor companies, having once more a free hand began competition afresh, and this resulted in the motor hire falling from £15 to £9, or even £8^ in the case of the journey to Medina, and to 125. as against £1 5s. in the case of the journey from Jedda to Mecca. This, however, did not benefit the pilgrims much, as they still had to pay the higher rate, the difference between the higher rate and the reduced rate going into the pockets of their mutawwifs, who hired cars for them at the lowest prices available. Protests made against these malpractices on the part of the mutawwifs were effective in some, though by no means in all, cases. 5. Another regulation affecting motor transport was the restriction imposed by the Government on the import of motor vehicles into this country, by which no car could be imported without the previous sanction of the Viceroy. ' This arrange ment greatly profited those persons who had the Viceroy's ear, Messrs. Sharqieli (Limited), among others, deriving considerable benefit. On the other hand, it checked a disproportionate increase in the supply of cars as compared with the demand.11 idu,. Motor Drivers. is p. 6. The Indian drivers here possess a good reputation for skill and good toiif behaviour. One motor company which had employed Indian drivers was highly % popular on this account, and other companies were tempted by this to recruit Indian drivers from India. No complaints were received from the Indian employees of or to; motor companies against their employers, except from those employed by Syed Siraj able j ; : Wali, already mentioned, who engaged drivers at Bombay at very low salaries, loiirsj alleging a low cost of living in the Hejaz, and further bound them by an agreement to serve him for fourteen months, in default of which they were to pay him istlj.. 1,000 rupees in compensation. ^j ; ' 7. It is suggested that, in order to safeguard the interests of ignorant drivers, notices should be widely published in the vernacular press in India some time before } f the pilgrimage season, informing persons who seek such service of the conditions prevailing here. er f 1El ' Camels. 560 cat 3We( [| r 8. Apart from the poorest class of pilgrims who travelled on foot, the majority to | a: :. of the pilgrims travelled by cars. Camels, therefore, were easily obtainable, and tj or pilgrims were not delayed on this account as they have been in previous years. uc ^,: 9. Camel hire between Jedda and Mecca this year was approximately the same as that of the year before or perhaps even lower, owing to a decrease in the price of motor hire compared with 1928.

The above are the fixed rates; some pilgrims, however, managed to obtain cheaper rates owing to the great number of camels available. (6.)— Customs. Customs formalities in the case of pilgrims entering the country were tightened up owing to attempts on the part of pilgrims and local merchants to use pil b rims baggage as a means of importing goods m some quantity without paying cus oms dues. The authorities made a very thorough search of pilgrims baggage, with the result that there was great congestion in the limited space of the custom-nouse. it would be as well if a general warning were issued to pilgrims not to attempt to smugerle g-oods into this country on their own account or on beha 0 . 0 . er P 61 ' 80118 ' In this connexion, some difficulty is experienced by the pilgrims m bringing m linen for shrouds, as is their usual custom. Tt would save a certain amount 01 troub e m the Indian pilgrimage office if pilgrims were advised to have it cut into the proper lengths before leaving India. If brought in in short lengths it is not subject to the payment of customs dues, whereas if full, uncut pieces are imported, customs dues are charged. This was frequently the subject of complaint. -i • mi, 2. Several cases of theft at the custom-house were reported by pilgrims, ine custom-house officials are, for the most part, of low class, and are poorly paid, and thev are not averse on occasion to purloining articles if the owner s attention nags durinp- the customs search. 3° On leaving the country the pilgrims are not searched, but it is the custom to charge dues on cases containing Zemzem water and dates at the rate of about Is. a case. 0 The pilgrims resent this charge; they were, however, still louder in their protestations when, on embarkation, their Zemzem water was thrown overboard by the ship's doctor, who was ignorant of its nature, and was only concerned with its chemical properties. It would be as well if pilgrims had their cases of Zemzem water labelled as such. (7.)— Mutawwifs. The attitude of the mutawwif is the governing factor in the pilgrim s comfort or discomfort in the Hejaz. On landing at Jedda the pilgrim realises at once, and he is forced to realise, that he is no longer a free agent, but that his mutawwif is the sole arbiter of all his actions and movements. A good-natured or well -intentioned mutawwif will ensure a peaceful stay. These are few and far between, and the mutawwif is as a rule an unscrupulous individual, who causes infinite trouble to the pilgrims; in fact, the mutawwif's negligence or ill-will has sometimes resulted in loss of life. 2. The chief difficulty lies in the fact that no proper official control is yet exercised over the mutawwifs. No amount of reforms in other directions will be satisfactory until the mutawwifs are subjected to a rigorous control and severely punisihed for malpractices. The Indian vice-consul has in many cases, particularly in 1926 and 1927, succeeded in having fines imposed. This had a salutary effect for a time. During the 1929 pilgrimage, however, conditions changed for the worse. On the one hand, the intervention of the Indian vice-consul was misrepresented to the King by certain influential Indian agitators as having a political object. On the other hand, the mutawwifs succeeded in entrenching themselves behind some of the higher officials, and were abetted also by some of the shipping clerks. At Jedda it was still possible to keep the mutawwif situation in hand, but at Mecca it was often very difficult to obtain satisfaction, and complaints regarding the mutawwifsthere were more frequent than in the two years preceding. It is, furthermore, often impossible to secure conclusive evidence of guilt owing to the fact that complaints are generally made verbally, and that there is a disinclination on the part ot the pilgrims to substantiate them in writing. _ 1 3. A general source of complaint was the fact that the mutawwifs charged hi^h sums for motor hire and for expenses at Arafat, which they collected in advance, while the transport which they eventually provided was thoroughly bad. The accommodation given at Arafat was also of the poorest description, and there was much overcrowding. Many cases of theft were reported at Muna and Arafat. In Mecca thefts took place from the persons of pilgrims in the Holy Mosque itself. 4. Misappropriation of the effects of deceased pilgrims was also of common occurrence. This was abundantly proved by the small amount of cash and effects which were handed over to the British agency in relation to the number of the deceased and their circumstances. The amount of the effects, including cash, of deceased pilgrims handed over was, in fact, obviously and scandalously short. 5. The present chief of the mutawwifs, the Sheikh-el-Mutawwifeen, obtained approval last year for a suggestion of his to impose an additional tax of 105. per head on all pilgrims going to Medina. This he collected himself, the amount so taken bein 0, the perquisite of the Viceroy, as was generally known, and not being credited to the Government Treasury. The Sheikh-el-Mutawwifeen by this means acquired considerable influence and took to collecting, simultaneously with the 105. tax. Is. per pilgrim for himself. All the mutawwifs now, with the support of their sheikh, which carries with it that of the higher Government officials, are able to insist upon the payment of excessive charges practically with impunity. 6. This change in the official attitude has affected pilgrims affairs generally. The reforms introduced last year are being allowed to fall into abeyance and abuses are again creeping in. Unless serious steps are taken to check this growing tendency on the part of the mutawwifs to evade regulations and abuse their position, they will quickly revert to the same malpractices which prevailed under the Turkish and Shereefian regimes. . 7 The remedy for the present state of afiairs lies to a certain extent m our own hands. According to present regulations, the pilgrims, with the exception of those of certain provinces, vide infra, are at liberty to choose whichever mutawwif thev like. This liberty of choice can be used with advantage to bring the mutawwifs to heel A list of mutawwifs of good reputation might well be drawn up at the British Legation and sent to the authorities at the pilgrims' ports of embarkation. These authorities might then recommend mutawwifs to the pilgrims. The undesirable mutawwifs would thus find themselves automatically deprived of clients. Such a system would be independent of the Hejaz Government, and would, I think, serve the purpose and induce the Hejaz Government to take proper steps itself. 8. The following suggestions are also put forward for consideration : (i) The British Legation should be empowered to refuse a visa for territory under British control to^ any mutawwif who gives serious cause of complaint or is found o-uilty of malpractices. The existence of a Black List for this purpose would act as a healthy deterrent, and I do not think that in practice it would be found necessary to refuse many visas after the first one or two cases. Such action is alieady taken by the Dutch consul m Jedda, and he is helped by the fact that no Dutch consul other than himself is authorised to grant a visa for Java to a Hejazi national, save in exceptional cases. i r. i 9^ (ii) There would appear to be some collusion between the mutawwits and certain Moulvis in India, particularly in Bengal, tending to circumscribe the pilgrims' free right of choice of their mutawwifs. The Moulvis in many cases, it is stated, pose as pilgrims' guides, and at the time of the So'al {i .e., when the pilgrims are asked to state their choice of mutawwifs) they sell their pilgrims to the highest 1 bidders among the mutawwifs who are congregated at Bombay. Information has been received that pilgrims have been passed on in this way at prices amounting to as much as 30 rupees a head. It follows that a mutawwif who has heavy overhead charges of this nature, involving probably his own and a servant's journey to India, can only make a profit if he has recourse to illegal methods. It would be a good thing if some means could be devised for bringing these Moulvis to book. 10. (iii) It would be advisable to keep a watch over mutawwifs' movements in India. In particular, judging by the complaints received, it is suggested that a closer surveillance should be exercised over their activities in the pilgrims' rest camp at Bombay.14 11. There is an idea on foot of farming out the Mahometan world to mutawwifs by auction, every Mahometan district being assigned or pi grimage- purposes to the exclusive exploitation of the mutawwif who bids highest. The system is a pernicious one, although it is calculated to bring in a grea y increased revenue to the Government, as it would place the pilgums a e mercy o he mutawwifs, and would expose them to various forms of extortion. 12. This system is actually in force in respect of pilgrims from Madras, Ceylon, the Maldive Islands, Bihar and Orissa, Malabar and Burma, those pilgrims having no choice but to accept the mutawwif appointed by the He] az Governmeiit for their respective provinces. These mutawwifs run no risk of losing clien s, and therefore they have no need to nurse their reputation. The pilgrims rom these provinces have often complained about their mutawwifs. ihe mutawwit tor Malabar and Ceylon, Syed Siraj Wali, who has already been mentioned m connexion with other malpractices, appears to be the worst of them, to judge by the complaints received about him. The matter is engaging the attention of the British Legation, and it is hoped that when the King returns to the Hejaz it will be possible to secure greater freedom of choice of mutawwif for the pilgrims from the provinces abo\e mentioned. „ „ , j , 13. Perhaps it is only fair to add a word in defence of the mutawwifs, however obiectionable they may be as a class. The greater proportion of the taxes which are collected nominally on behalf of the mutawwifs are in reality collected on Govern ment account as supplementary to the more recognised and open forms of Government taxation. In fact, the proportion allowed to be retained by the mutawwifs is often far too small to enable them to gain a livelihood by legitimate methods in the exercise of their profession. As long as this is the case the mutawwifs, in order to obtain enough money to carry them through the lean season, will continue to extort money from pilgrims'in different ways with the connivance of the local authorities. (8.)— Religious Intolerance. The British agency did not receive the usual number of complaints from the pilgrims of interference in the performance of their religious observances, nor was any particular hardship suffered by pilgrims reported from Medina. The main reason of this was that the local Government took precautionary measures, warning the mutawwifs against taking their pilgrims to places where there was any likeli hood of disturbance. At Mecca, a w T all was built round the site of the tomb of Khadija to screen it from public view. I 2. Complaints of interference which used to be received in past years in connexion with observances at the Prophet's Tomb in Medina, came almost entirely from the educated and wealthy section of the pilgrims who were prevented from having access to the tomb. These pilgrims induced the Nejdi soldiers, by offering them a small bribe of a few piastres, to allow them to touch the railings surrounding the holy grave of the Prophet. The poorer section of the pilgrims were subjected to a mild stroke of the whip when they attempted to touch the railings, but no formal complaint was received from them at the British agency. (9.)— Indian Pilgrimages. The number of pilgrims who sailed from Indian ports for the Hejaz this season was 19,832, including 176 children, as against 21,109 last year. Of this total, Britisa Indians accounted for 14,997, their number being 1,043 in excess of that for 192&amp; This increase was largely due to an increase in the number of Bengali pilgrims, of whom there were 7,227, as against 5,105 in 1928. The other provinces showed a diminution in numbers. 2. The following table indicates (1) the number of pilgrims from eacli province in India and the ports at which they embarked; and (2) the approximate numbers of foreign pilgrims who reached the Hejaz by way of Indian ports :—u. 15 (A.)—B ritish Subjects.

Little difficulty was experienced in securing return passages for the pilgrims, as there was no lack of steamers; the number of pilgrims detained at Jedda for want of accommodation was consequently small. The local agents of Messrs. Nemazee and Co., however, were, as last year, responsible for a certain 'amount of inconvenience to pilgrims, as, having little confidence, it would appear, In the financial standing of their principals, they were slow in refunding the balance of passage money (30 rupees) due to pilgrims who, having paid for the double journey from Calcutta to Jedda and back, were, on their return, to be conveyed only as far as Bombay. 4. In many cases the members of a family or of one party were separated from one another owing to the fact that some of them had return tickets, while the others ; were in possession of deposit paid passes. In these cases the local agents of the Nemazee line, after considerable persuasion, were induced to refund 30 rupees to the return ticket holders; but they categorically refused to entertain the claims of the deposit paid pass holders; these had eventually to be sent back to India on ships of the Mogul line. However, none of their pilgrims were detained in Jedda beyond the period allowed, a few pilgrims of the Shustari line being alone so detained. 5. It was anticipated that, owing to the opposition of M. Ismail Ghaznavi and other leading Indian Wahhabis, difficulties would be experienced this year over the constitution after the pilgrimage of the locally organised Haj Committee, which has 'met each year since 1927, under the presidency of the Indian vice-consul, for the purpose of drawing up lists of the returning pilgrims and of allotting them steamer accommodation for their return journey to India in the order of their arrival at Jedda.16 6 Ismail Ghaznavi and various other leading Indian W ahhabis advocated the abolition of this committee, urging fictitious P 0 J| tlcal attempted to secure preferential treatment for themselves and their - en ds m defiance of the committee's rulings. They were, however unsuccessful and the committee was formed and carried on its work as usual with the concurrence of the Heiaz Government, which deputed the president of the official Ha] Committee to act as vice-president, and the chief of the mutawwifs to be a member. e Persian diplomatic representative, having been invited to participate in the interests of Persian pilgrims returning to their homes via India, also sent a delegate to attend the meetings on his behalf. Registration System: 7. The working of this system and the advantages gained by its application have been discussed in previous reports. . . „ , . 8. In view of a temporary shortage of staff at the beginning oi the season the registration of the pilgrims arriving by the first steamer, the Khosrou, could not be carried out. Moreover, the permanent clerk in the Indian pilgrimage office contracted small-pox early in April and was unable to fulfil his duties for some time on that account. . P ■ a • ^ As was the case last year, it was found that, while it was a i airly simple matter to collect the return tickets of the incoming pilgrims, their re-distribution on the return of the pilgrims after the Haj against the requisite receipts was far from easy. Incoming pilgrims arrive at Jedda in comparatively small numbers and can be easily dealt with; in the return season, however, it is a different matter There were this season as many as 12,000 Indian pilgrims who returned to Jedda in the first week after the Haj, and the Indian staff were hard put to it to see that eadi member received proper attention. 9. It is evident, therefore, that the efficient working of the registration system, which is an undoubted boon to pilgrims, depends very largely on the number and efficiency of the clerical staff of the Indian Pilgrimage Office. The British Indian vice-consul who is in charge of that department is assisted by one permanent clerk and one clerk who is on a year's probation. The daily routine duties have fully occupied all three during the whole of the past year; it is, therefore, strongly recommended that the appointment of the second clerk be made a permanent one. It is suggested also that pilgrims be advised prior to their embarkation in India to deposit their tickets at the British Legation in Jedda on their arrival at that port. Advice to this effect might with advantage be printed in the vernacular on each pilgrim pass. These suggestions would have a greater effect if the control of shipping as advocated above were enforceable by law; pilgrims would then realise that unless they handed over their return tickets as advised, they would be liable to be delayed on their return journey. 10. In conclusion it may be pointed out that the undoubted success with which the registration system has worked is in large measure due to the excellent relations prevailing between the Indian vice-consul and the local authorities and the mutawwifs. This state of affairs, however, may not last for ever and it is most desirable, therefore, that everything possible should be done to place the local control of the pilgrimage on a more solid basis. Shipping Control. 11. In view of the criticism which has been levelled at the present system of shipping control by interested parties, it is worth while recapitulating some of the considerations which led to its adoption. 12. As soon as the pilgrimage is over the pilgrims flock to Jedda in thousands and the problem of their repatriation immediately becomes acute. .The facilities for quick transport offered by motor-cars are so great that a very large proportion of the Indian pilgrims (this year 65 per cent, of the total) return to Jedda withic one week of the Haj. The consequent overcrowding in Jedda at this period, inevitable as it is, is the cause of much suffering among the pilgrims who are already tired out and without means when they reach Jedda. Lack of accommo dation, bad sanitation, scarcity of water, and illness, all combine to make the pilgrims' stay in Jedda until passages on outgoing steamers can be found for theiD a period of great strain and hardship. It is, therefore, obvious that this period of waiting should, in the interests of all concerned, be reduced as far as possible, and this can only be brought about if the steamship companies are subjected to effective control.17 13. Before the introduction of the present system in 1926 the pilgrims were far worse off than they are now. The mutawwifs in co-operation with the subordinate staff of the shipping agents provided accommodation only for such pilgrims as could afford to bribe them. Some of the shipping clerks through their brokers were in the habit of selling embarkation tickets at a higher rate than that fixed by the companies, pocketing the surplus. Return ticket holders were, at the threat of being left behind, forced to buy fresh tickets at higher rates, while their original tickets were sold by the mutawwifs. Mutawwifs had full powers over their pilgrims and treated them as they liked, while the latter, afraid of being unable to obtain a passage, dared not protest. The result was that the poorer pilgrims, who were the least fitted to endure the effects of a prolonged stay in Jedda under the existing conditions, not possessing the means of bribing the mutawwifs and the staffs of the shipping agencies, were compelled to await the departure of the last ship from Jedda before being able to begin their return journey. It is certain that these conditions would obtain again were the shipping control removed or relaxed. 14. Those most directly concerned in the pilgrim traffic, the local agents of the shipping companies, have on many occasions admitted that they are glad to sacrifice some of their powers of control over the pilgrim ships in view of the benefits which accrue both to themselves and to the pilgrims under the new system of shipping control. 15. Criticism of the scheme has so far only come from those who profiteered i 8 under the old regime. One objection that is advanced is that it is impossible for the Government of India to control its pilgrim ships in Hejaz ports. This contention can be refuted by citing the fact that the Egyptian Government, who, in the ! beginning, followed the same system as is now employed by the Government of India, have now established control of their pilgrim ships. All that is required is appropriate legislation by the Indian Government. ri 16. From the foregoing it will be clear that efficient control of pilgrim shipping , is the most important factor in the regulation of the return pilgrimage. It is possible that the Hejaz Government may, at some time or other, contemplate suppressing the locally organised Haj Committee. If this were in fact to occur, it would be most , advisable to introduce legislation in India to ensure that, in the return pilgrimage season, British ships carrying pilgrims shall be subject to some sort of equivalent . control. 17. With regard to the shipping lists furnished, the importance of these cannot : be overestimated; on them depends, to a large extent, the success of the registration , system, while, subsequently, they form the only complete record of pilgrims' move- ments in Jedda, coming and going. It is therefore desirable that the greatest care should be exercised in their preparation. In several cases lists have been found to be inaccurately made out. 18. With regard to these lists, the following suggestions are put forward for the consideration of the Government of India :— lat (1) Separate lists should be furnished for each steamer, although it is not il necessary for them to be forwarded to Jedda by the steamer to which they is! refer; they may be sent by the following steamer. % (2) The name of the ship and the date of its departure should invariably be noted at the top of each list. The date of sailing has often been omitted in the past, thereby making it difficult to trace the names of pilgrims; as often as not, the same steamer will make more than one voyage in one season. (3) Some sort of distinguishing marks should, as has already been recommended, be introduced in the list, to show whether the pilgrim passes of the pilgrims figuring on the list were issued at Calcutta, Bombay or Karachi. The marks shown hereunder would be suitable for pilgrim passes supplied to British Indians and foreigners; passes issued to the latter should differ in some way from those issued to the former. For British Indians— Bombay ; Pass No. B/ Calcutta : Pass No. C/ Karachi: Pass No. K/ For foreigners— Bombay : Pass No. BF / Calcutta : Pass No. CF/ Karachi: Pass No. KF/ [21133] d18 19. The distinguishing letters shown above should be prefixed to the pass number and should be considered for all purposes as forming an integral part of the pass number; the shipping companies should be instructed to adhere strictly to these distinguishing letters when inserting the pass numbers on the steamer ticket, &amp;c. Shifping (General). 20. Three shipping companies were concerned in the transport of pilgrims between India and the Hejaz, namely, the Mogul Line,, the Nemazee Line and the Shustari Line. The following table shows the number carried each way by each of these companies and the number of voyages made by their vessels :— Brought in. Repatriated. No. of Ships. No. of Voyages to Jedda. Pilgrims brought. No. of Ships. No. of Return Voyages. Pilgrims repatriated. Mogul Line ... 6 9 11,213 7 12 10,038 Nemazee Line 3 4 4,453 3 3 3,017 Shustari Line 2 3 3,990 2 3 3,512 Total 11 16 19,656 12 18 16,567 21. It will be noted that the total number of pilgrims who returned to India after the Haj was 3,089 short of the number that arrived in the Hejaz from India. These were divided among the shipping lines as follows :— Number of Pilcrims not returning. Mogul Line ... ... ... ... 1,175 Nemazee Line ... ... ... ... 1,436 Shustari Line ... ... ... ... 478 3,089 22. Of these 3,089 pilgrims, 157 were Javanese or Malays who had travelled to the Hejaz via India, but elected to return to their homes by a direct route; 1,000 approximately were Persians and Bokharis who returned by the Northern route (a few Indians also did this), while 880 deaths took place. The remaining 1,052 may be accounted for by the number of Hejazis who had travelled from India on pilgrim ships and the Indians who decided to remain in the Hejaz after the pilgrimage. 23. Apart from the Indian pilgrims leaving from and returning to Indian ports, the following numbers of persons other than Indians were carried by Indian pilgrim steamers to various ports in the Red Sea and the Arabian coast:— Mogul Line. Nemazee. Aden ... ... ... 78 98 Kamaran ... ... ... 94 Mokalla ... ... ... 182 Hodeida ... ... ... ... 5(55 Jibouti ... ... ... ... 98 354 761 24. The following list gives the numbers of pilgrims arriving in Jedda froffi and leaving for Indian ports, classified according to ports : Arrivals. Departures. Bombay ... ... 11,196 12,807 Karachi ... ... 7,457 3709 Calcutta ... ... 1,003 19,656 16,567r { t 19 25, The number of 3,780 pilgrims stated to have landed at Karachi cannot be considered as accurate; Messrs. Shustari issued to their pilgrims tickets marked 'Bombay or Karachi,' and it is not known what proportion of these ticket-holders landed at each of those two ports. It may safely be presumed, however, that the larger number disembarked at Karachi. 26. The number of pilgrims who purchased single and return tickets or made money deposits in India may be classified as follows :— Bombay Karachi Calcutta Total Single Ticket. Return Ticket.

From the statistics given the following facts may be deduced :— The ships had in some cases to wait at Jedda, as a sufficient number of their respective pilgrims were not available at the time. The steamships ' Englestan ' and ' Akbar ' were obliged to leave with 371 and 145 pilgrims on board respectively, and that at a time when many pilgrims of the Shustari Line were awaiting the arrival of a Shustari steamer to take them. Had the compulsory deposit system been in force, this would not have occurred. Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co. were able to deal with their returning pilgrims without much difficulty; their steamers left at short intervals, and many pilgrims holding return tickets of the Shustari Line, who could not wait for the arrival of a Shustari steamer, purchased fresh tickets from the Mogul Line, registering at the British agency their claims for refund of money spent on their original tickets. 29. Certain other difficulties were experienced with regard to shipping, which, though of minor importance in themselves, caused not a little inconvenience at the time. These are briefly mentioned for the information of the Government of India:— {a) The shipping companies, considering on occasion that the number of pilgrims booked for Karachi was not sufficient to warrant their calling at that port, proceeded direct to Bombay. This naturally evoked many and violent protests from pilgrims whose homes are in Sind, Baluchistan, the Punjab or the North-West Frontier Province. It is not known whether the companies can be compelled to call at Karachi in such cases, or, failing this, to pay the pilgrims' railway fare between the two ports; in any case, a decision should be taken in the matter, so that the pilgrims may be informed accordingly. (&amp;) Pilgrims holding return tickets issued by the Shustari and Nemazee lines, who for some reason or other did not return to India, experienced great difficulty in obtaining the refund of their return passage money. It is desirable that the local Jedda agents of these companies should be instructed by their principals to comply strictly and promptly with the regulations on the subject. (c) This year these two companies issued a few tickets marked ' free for the return journey.' Holders of these tickets did not in many cases reach Jedda until after the departure of the last steamers belonging to these lines, and the agents refused to provide an alternative passage, as is done in the case of the usual return ticket holders. The persons concerned in most cases became destitute, and were repatriated at the expense of the Government of India. It would assist matters if the companies in question were requested to refrain from issuing such tickets, a course which involves the Government of India in unnecessary expenditure. Alternatively, if the companies insist for one reason or another on issuing ' free ' tickets, they should themselves take measures through their local agents to ensure that such persons are not left stranded in Jedda after the pilgrimage. 30. The following points in connexion with the pilgrim traffic are also worth consideration ;— (1) The shipping companies should endeavour, as far as possible, to employ Moslem crews. This measure would certainly go a long way towards reducing the complaints at present being continually made by pilgrims against the shipping companies. If this is not entirely practicable, it is suggested that, at any rate, ships' doctors, compounders, clerks and water distributors should be Moslems. (2) It is desirable that the loading and unloading of pilgrims' luggage in Jedda harbour be undertaken by the shipping companies in the same way as ship's cargo, namely, by engagement of labour and the use of derricks. The companies are in the habit of unloading 40,000 to 50,000 packages at any one time, and there would appear to be no sound reason why the system should not be extended to cover pilgrims' luggage. This is already the practice in the case of the Javanese pilgrimage. (3) Connected with the foregoing is the question of landing the pilgrims at the quay. Here, also, arrangements are necessary, such as may spare the pilgrims any dealings with the dhowmen, whose main object is to fleece22 them in every wciy. Xins cjuestion ii3/S tixiecid^'j i- iii.i(ierstcin(ij bccii considered by tiie Grovernnieiit of' lndi3;, .but the shipping compaiiies who- deal with the Indian pilgrimage are apparently strongly opposed to it, and despite the fact that the system has been proved to work satisfactorily in the case of the Javanese and Egyptian pilgrimages, the proposals made in this connexion have not so far been adopted, i ne matter, however, is important from the pilgrims point of view, and it is worth noting that the dhowmen themselves, to judge from their own statements, would welcome a system which would relieve them oi the necessity of collecting their fares individually from the pilgrims. The harbour in Jedda is divided into three areas, kno\\n as the outer harbour, the middle harbour and the inner harbour, ihe rates for the transport of pilgrims and their luggage have been fixed by the Govern ment at 1/4/— rupees, 1/— rupees and —/10/— rupees for the three harbours respectively. In 1928, on the suggestion of the Indian vice- consul, the head of the dhowmen agreed to charge one rupee in all cases irrespective of the distance. This proposal was submitted to the Hejaz Government, but in the absence of the King it fell through. It is suggested that by arrangement with the dhowmen, which should not be difficult, the shipping companies should book pilgrims from shore to shore. If necessary, a small extra charge might be imposed and included in the cost of the passage. Such a course would benefit both pilgrims and dhowmen alike. (4) Better arrangements should be made for the distribution of water on board the pilgrim ships during the voyage. The quantity of water supplied should also be increased. The present water allowance, 1^ gallons per pilgrim per day, is altogether insufficient. The Mogul Line have m the past stated that they supplied their pilgrims with much more water than the quantity to which they were entitled, while Messrs. Nemazee have for years been supplying free water. This would indicate that the companies themselves recognise that the ration of water as originally fixed is inadequate. If, however, the companies are compelled to supply food to the pilgrims while on board, the water question will automatically be solved and the above quantity will be more than enough. In any case, whatever the decision taken on this point may be, it is recommended that extra pumps be installed for the distribution of water, one pump on each deck. This would enable the pilgrims to obtain the water more easily and would do away with many of the complaints which at present arise on this score. (5) The question of supplying food to the pilgrims during the voyage was recommended in last year's report. It has been argued, however, that an experiment on the lines proposed was tried by the Mogul Line but that it - proved a failure. If this is so, the reason for the failure would appear to be that the pilgrims had already purchased their food before embarkation as they were ignorant of the fact that food could be obtained on board. This explanation was supported by the evidence of several of the leading pilgrims. Pilgrims as a general rule wish to travel as economically as possible, and it is obvious that the aggregate individual expenditure of a shipload of pilgrims on food is much greater than would be the case if the catering were done by the companies. Experience has shown that pilgrims are generally prepared to pay high steamer fares. In 1927 as the result of keen competition between the various companies, tickets for the return journey were bought by the pilgrims at the low rate of 80 rupees, while this season an approximately equal amount of pilgrims paid 195 rupees for the same journey. If, therefore, the companies would add a further 12 to 15 rupees to the cost of their steamer tickets on account of food, it would make no appreciable difference to the numbers of pilgrims booking passages on their ships. But, for such a measure to be effective it is essential that prior notice of it be widely published and its benefit explained to intending pilgrims. (6) During the season over 7,000 Bengalis sailed from Bombay. On arrival in Bombay from Calcutta they find themselves in a strange country where their language is not understood, and they pay the usual toll taken from strangers. It would seem to be greatly preferable that Bengali pilgrims-23 should be induced by legislation or otherwise to embark at Calcutta. This would also benefit the shipping companies who would then have to deal with a practically uniform class of passenger having the same tastes in food and the same customs. The journey from Calcutta to Bombay is made purely in the mutawwif's interest at present. (7) It is recommended that Indian ships should use four ladders for the embarkation and disembarkation of pilgrims instead of two only. This is already obligatory by law in the case of the Egyptian pilgrims, and these operations are greatly facilitated thereby. In this connexion care should be taken to see that the ladders are not placed in close proximity to the discharge of the circulating water or else that the circulating water is not discharged while pilgrims are being embarked or disembarked. (8) Pilgrims travelling first or second class have made the following complaints :— (a) There is no special deck for them and they have consequently to confine themselves to their cabins. Even the gangways outside their cabins are crowded with deck passengers. (b) In the Mogul Line ships the saloon is reserved for the officers, and pilgrims, though travelling first-class, are not allowed to use it. The Nemazee and Shustari lines actually utilise the saloons as space for carrying pilgrims who are prepared to pay something slightly in excess of the fare for deck passages. It is suggested that this question be considered with a view to reserving separate deck and saloon accommo dation for first- and second-class passengers. (c) It often happens that on the return journey all the first-class passengers of any one line assemble at Jedda at the same time, and on account of the multitude of applicants are unable to obtain immediately the first-class accommodation for which they have paid. They are accordingly offered by the companies the choice of waiting for a later steamer or of travelling as deck passengers. If they choose the latter course, they are induced to sign a declaration to the effect that they are travelling as deck passengers of their own free will and that they have no claim for refund of the balance of their fare. The shipping companies should, I think, be compelled to return the balance of the fare in such cases. (9) Masters of ships should be requested to extend to the Indian vice-consul all facilities necessary for visiting pilgrim ships in Jedda Harbour and getting into touch with pilgrims for the purpose of receiving the effects of deceased pilgrims, investigating complaints, &amp;c. It has been found that if complaints are attended to on the spot much trouble is spared to all concerned. In this connexion it would be of advantage if the Indian pilgrimage officer, acting under the authority of His Majesty's Minister in Jedda, were empowered, irtiutatis mutandis, to act under Appendix B, Bombay Act V of 1915, entitled Protection of Pilgrims (clause 9), and his name inserted in this article. &lt;10) Before weighing anchor for the return journey from Jedda, masters of ships should be requested to wait until the Indian pilgrimage officer is fully satisfied that the pilgrims embarked have no complaints against persons in the Hejaz and have not left any of their effects behind them on the quays or in the dhows. This would not, as a rule, delay a ship for more than an hour. Hitherto ships have sailed as soon as the last pilgrims have embarked, thus leaving them no time to ascertain whether all their luggage has come on board. Here, again, an appropriate article might be inserted in the Act mentioned in the preceding paragraph. (11) The embarkation tickets issued by Messrs. Turner, Morrison are small in size and are consequently easily lost. It is desirable that they should be much larger and that they should consist of two portions, one portion to be retained by the pilgrims. It would also be of assistance if the class . of a pilgrim's ticket were entered on the embarkation ticket, as much pnof confusion results at present in the absence of this ,ag Detention of Pilgrims. fflLff . 31 - This Year a small number of pilgrims only, limited to those of the Shustari a |jp| ;Ijine ' were detained in Jedda for lack of-shipping accommodation beyond the period24 allowed- the following table shows the number of pilgrims thus detained^the period of their'detention, and the sums distributed to them as compensatio . Compensation. No. of Pilgrims. No. of Days Detained. Rupees. 1 15 10 1 14 14 2 12 24 8 48 19 6 114 o 4 36 ? 3 21 6 2 12 17 1 1/ 301 32. Of the total of 301 rupees shown above, 38 rupees was returned by well-to-do pilgrims to be used for the relief of the more indigent among thenr 33 The compensation allowed for such detention is 1 rupee per day for passengers of all classes. First- and second-class pilgrims objected to this on the ground that their standard of living is higher than that oi the deck passengers, and that thev consequently find it much more expensive to maintain themselves m Jedda during the period of waiting. They have, furthermore, paid from three to four times as much on their steamer fares as third-class pilgrims, and they see no valid reason why they should only be compensated at the same rate as these latter. Deck pilgrims also complained that the allowance of 1 rupee per day was insufficient to pay tor the extra daily expense which they incurred. This was certainly the case, tor the cost of living is always extremely high in the Hejaz at the time when the pilgrims are waiting to return home. Destitutes. 34. The question of the repatriation of destitute Indian pilgrims has^ been the subject of discussion for several years. Since the introduction of the deposit and return-ticket system the numbers of destitutes repatriated annually has very greatly diminished. A considerable number of cases, however, still occur. Some pilgrims, for instance, reach the Hejaz by the overland route through Nejd. Others make declarations at Karachi to the effect that they intend to make a prolonged stay in the Hejaz, but, in spite of this, apply for repatriation after the pilgrimage; others, again, lose their return tickets. This last category was not numerous, thanks to the institution of the system of registration. 35. Another factor which operated to reduce the number of destitutes this year was the fact that destitute Afghan pilgrims, having been told that neither the Turkish representative nor the British Agency would help them, prevailed upon the wealthier Jedda merchants to repatriate them. Several Indians from the frontier districts declared themselves to be Afghans in order to benefit from the charity extended to nationals of that country. 36. To put an end to the question of destitutes altogether, so far as arrivals by sea are concerned, the Government of India has only to prohibit the issue of single tickets to pilgrims except in the case of first- and second-class passengers. The system at present in force is not intended to prevent persons of obvious means from travelling as they wish, but neither is it intended to afford probable destitutes with a loophole for evading compliance with the regulations which have been laid down for their benefit. It is therefore recommended that the authorities concerned, particularly at Karachi, should take special care to distinguish between the various classes of pilgrims in this respect. 37. After the season was over, also, a number of pilgrims from Karachi travelled to the Hejaz furnished with single tickets only. Those who have arrived are for the most part persons of restricted means, and several of them will in all probability eventually have to be repatriated as destitutes. This is to be deprecated. 38. The problem presented by pilgrims travelling overland through Nejd is one which is likely to become more difficult to deal with as time goes on. During the Hashimite regime the overland route was to all intents and purposes closed by reason of the disturbances in the interior. The situation has now changed, and the roads are safe. Ibn Saud's officers, in fact, have, in some cases secured free conveyance25 from Riyadh to Mecca for those pilgrims who had travelled to the capital of Nejd from the Persian Gulf. It looks, therefore, as if the overland route may become more popular. Should this occur, the Government of India will find itself involved in increased expenditure on account of repatriation of destitutes, and it is, therefore, desirable that restrictions be brought into force with a view to reducing to a minimum the numbers of pilgrims travelling by this route. 39. The method of dealing with destitutes at this Legation is as follows :— No hint of possible repatriation is given until the last minute before the various ships sail. The object of this is to induce those who have money and are concealing the fact to buy a ticket for themselves through fear of missing the steamer, so that only the genuine destitutes may be left. Secondly, many destitutes during the waiting period receive charity from the richer pilgrims sufficient to enable them to buy a ticket, and there are also many rich pilgrims who take destitutes with them on board at their own expense. The expenses incurred on behalf of repatriation are, in this way, reduced to a minimum. For instance, the number of destitutes who tuntt originally applied for repatriation after the Haj reached approximately 300, but, [em, by following the above system, the numbers were greatly reduced, and those actually r dn repatriated amounted only to 139. 40. If the news of repatriation were made public earlier in the return season, = , then those even who possessed tickets would apply for repatriation and either ^attempt to sell their tickets locally or apply for a refund on them on their return to ni,r India. alids 41. This practice of not disclosing until the last minute the fact that there will P be any repatriation at Government expense, a practice which is essential if expenses P a J. are to be kept down, makes it practically impossible for the Legation to furnish the .^Government of India beforehand with information as to the number of destitutes to 'o ni be repatriated. Furthermore, up to the last moment, the number continues to be increased by arrivals from the interior. 42. It would, therefore, be in the interest of the Government of India, and it would greatly facilitate matters at this end, if the British Legation were empowered is haste repatriate in anticipation of sanction. In this way it would be possible to obtain depositthe cheapest rates from the shipping companies, for the Legation would be enabled ^erygito take advantage at any moment of the competitive prices which it is possible to [e pilpbtain when steamers of different lines are in harbour at one time. To illustrate thersithis, it may be pointed out that in 1928, when early sanction was received, it was gedstifound possible to secure destitute passages at the rate of £1 per head on account of ^oihe competition between the companies; in 1929, however, there being only one ian k s ;:3teamer in port when the sanction arrived, and consequently no competition, the price vas higher, namely, 25 and 35 rupees. ^ 43. The total expense incurred on account of repatriation of destitutes this ^llpeason was 4,011 rupees, which included the sum of 351 rupees for food on the gwoyage. Food was supplied at the rate of 3 rupees per head by the Pilgrim Food the fcpupply Company, under the supervision of the master of ship. ^ (jj 44. In case it may be of interest to the Government of India, the following list las been compiled, showing the proportion of destitutes repatriated according to agaI pheir provinces of origin :— sue of s ngers.

Of the above destitutes, ninety-nine travelled to the Hejaz by the overland •oute and forty by sea; the latter had made declarations in India. ' [2113326 Deposit System. 46. The advantages which would accrue from the universal application of the compulsory deposit system have already been submitted to the Ha] Enquiry Committee in detail. One recommendation however, which ^ . ur ^ again is that pilgrims should be induced as far as possible to deposit an additional 30 rupees per head at the time of tfce deposit made to cover would save them all the inconveniences to which they are subjected on their return to Jedda as a result of lack of funds. This sum could be paid to the pilgrims in Jedda by the agents of the shipping companies, by arrangement, when the embarka- tion tickets are issued. , ... _ * 47 In this connexion it may be pointed out that, under the existing regulations, the refund of a deposit is made only in India. Those pilgrims who do not intend to return to India after one year's stay in the Hejaz have to apply to this Legation to obtain a refund, and their passes have to be forwarded to India for the purpose. This entails considerable delay for the pilgrims and not a little extra work for the Legation staff. It would, therefore, be of advantage if refund could be made in Jedda and it is suggested that in the interests of all concerned tlhe name of His Maiesty's Minister at Jedda or of the Indian pilgrimage officer be inserted m rule 68-J of Government of India notification No. 1734, Health, of the 15th December, 1926. Pilgrim Passes. 48. In view of the introduction of the deposit system, several alterations in the form of pilgrim pass were suggested in last year's report for the consideration of the Haj Committee. It was recommended, particularly, that photographs should be attached to the passes in the same way as is the case of regular passports. Another year's experience has confirmed the desirability of this. 49. As regards pilgrims of foreign nationalities, it is recommended that these should be supplied with a special form of emergency pass different from that issued to British pilgrims. This would simplify the procedure at Jedda in dealing witli foreign pilgrims. 50. Twenty-six emergency passes were issued by the British agency this season, of which sixteen were granted to Indians whose passes, not having been deposited in the usual way, were lost or stolen, while the remainder were issued to foreigners travelling to India. Cost of Pilgrimage, 51. The cost of the pilgrimage this year was approximately the same as last year. Pilgrims should therefore be advised that they should be in possession of not less than 600 rupees when they undertake the journey, that amount being exclusive of the steamship fare for the double journey. Should they propose to travel by car while in the Hejaz they should bring a further 100 rupees with them, Considerable difficulties are constantly experienced through pilgrims arriving in Jedda from India with insufficient funds. These have either to endure hardships or beg for charity. One reason for this is that charity tickets are often supplied by well-to-do merchants in India, and that no provision is made for the pilgrims subsistence while in the Hejaz. Staff. 52. I have great pleasure in testifying once again to the efficiency and devotion with which Munshi Ihsanullah, the British (Indian) vice-consul, discharged his duties. I can thoroughly endorse all that was said last year by my predecessor. His work is wholly admirable and deserves recognition. (10.)— A fghan Pilgrimage. Owing to civil war in Afghanistan during 1929, the number of Afghan pilgrims was considerably smaller than in the previous year, being only 1,162 as against 3,600 Of this total, 1,098 embarked at Karachi and 20 at Bombay, while 44 came from Suez. No notable Afghans made the pilgrimage this year.27 theiif pife 'regiili lotiitf kisLf: ertdi; Assk Is, k edtk: ytMsss 3en dep to fore The Turkish representative in Jedda claimed that he represented Afghan interests and employed an Afghan as messenger. Attempts were made by this messenger to induce^the Afghans to pay certain fees to the Turkish authorities, but, according to all reports, no money was forthcoming. The British agency, on the other hand, had the thankless task of dealing with all the various questions in connexion with the loss of Afghan passports and return tickets, &amp;c. Forty Afghans lost their return tickets this year; of this number, ten were given emergency passes to enable them to travel as far as India. There were several declared Afghan destitutes this year. Most of these, however, on account of the low prices prevailing as a result of competition between the various companies, eventually found themselves able to pay their own fares back to India. The remainder, sixty-three in number, were taken in charge by the local merchants, who arranged for their repatriation by the Mogul Line. The company, however, eventually decided to carry them free. (11.)— Malay Pilgrimage. The Malay pilgrimage season began on the 18th December, 1928, on which date the steamship ' Titan ' arrived in Jedda from Singapore with 410 pilgrims. The total number of arrivals from Malayan ports during the period under review was 5,869, among whom were 246 infants under 1 year of age. The pilgrims were conveyed in eleven ships, all of the Blue Funnel Line, the last of which arrived at Jedda on the 20th April, 1929. 2. The number of pilgrims actually from British Malaya, as shown in the register, was as follows :— Straits Settlements— Singapore Penang and Province Wellesley Malacca ... Federated Malay States— Perak Selangor ... Negri Sembilan Pahang Unfederated Malay States— Johore Kedah Perlis Kelantan ... Trengganu Brunei Labuan Total 242 123 64 224 92 52 61 168 160 33 142 76 14 4 1,455 ;s with' 5 arrwi haiv i su# 3. This is the lowest number on record since 1924, the year in which the system the pi of registration of Malay pilgrims was begun. This may be ascribed, however, simply to lack of funds, on account of the slump in rubber and the general trade depression existing in Malaya. Taken with the figures for the two previous years :— ■pp 1 ' ischaf j pred® In 1927 In 1928 12,184 pilgrims. 4,418 pilgrims. The average works out at 6,019 pilgrims a year for the last three years, or the period during which the system of compulsory pilgrim passes for Malay pilgrims has been enforced. This may perhaps be considered the normal figure. 4. The number of Malay pilgrims who came via India this year was thirty-three. It should be noted that a Malay pilgrim ceases technically to be a pilgrim, according to the definition of the word ' pilgrim ' in the Straits Settlements Merchant Shipping Ordinance, if he travels to the Hejaz via India. Passport officers, particularly in Penang, might well be reminded of this interpretation of the ordinance, so that the practice of giving a visa on the pilgrim pass for the journey to India mav be discontinued. This would save confusion in the registration of [21133]23 such pilerims in the office of the Malay pilgrimage officer, and perhaps discourage pilgrims from taking a route which they expect to be cheaper and more convenient^ but which nearly always turns out to be more expensive and more inconvenient. The many cases in which Malay pilgrims have been swindled in Indium t e past should be made known as widely as possible, in order to deter others m tuture irom taking this route. It might also be explained that, apart from other disadvantages, they lose their right to claim assistance from the Malay pilgrimage officer at Jedda as pilgrims within the meaning of the law as it now stands. Pilgrim Passes. 5. A uniform fee of 1 dollar for each pilgrim pass was charged throughout Malaya. It has been suggested that this fee might with advantage be raised from 1 dollar to, say, dollars, but it is doubtful whether this would be advisable. I would, however, recommend that non-British-protected nationals should be required to pay 2J dollars for each pass. A large percentage of the so-called Malay pilgrims are originally Dutch nationals who have resided over six months in Malaya, and j have lost their Dutch nationality through their omission to register themselves at a Dutch consulate. These persons do not become British subjects, of course, unless they complete the usual formalities; but the fact that the fee for a Malay pilgrim pass is less than that for a Dutch pass or an emergency pass (which, strictly speaking, they should take out) is a strong temptation to these people to claim over six months' residence in Malaya, when they are actually only in transit at the Malayan ports. Malay pilgrim passes have also been given on occasion to Hejazi nationals, Mecca sheikhs or other Arabs born in the Hejaz; this only gives rise to complications. Some suggestions for proposed alterations in the pilgrim pass form will be found under heading ' Effects of Deceased Pilgrims.' Pilgrims' Tickets. 6. According to the system in force, pilgrims should have had the option of purchasing either single or return tickets. Those who come to stay in the Hejaz should on principle have purchased single tickets, and, consequently, those who come with return tickets and remained in the Hejaz beyond the period of validity of their tickets (two seasons), were not by right entitled to claim refund on them. Neverthe less, pilgrims did in fact do so, alleging almost invariably that the pilgrim brokers in Penang or Singapore refused to issue single tickets to them. This, I am led to believe, was frequently the case, since it is to the advantage of the pilgrim brokers to have return tickets issued. At the same time there are also cases on record where pilgrims who never intended to remain in the Hejaz have suddenly changed their minds and have settled down in the country or vice versa. A sudden unforeseen change in their fortunes, through the death of some relative, for example, may have accounted for this. Then again, there are pilgrims from Malaya who change their mind after meeting in the Hejaz their relatives from other countries, and who return not to Malaya but direct to a port in the Dutch East Indies. All these persons expect the Malay pilgrimage officer to assist them in obtaining the refund on their unused tickets. The first bundle of tickets (those issued in 1926) sent with a request for such refunds was received in 1928, when after much discussion, it was decided to extend the validit} 7 of the tickets for a further period of three years. On the other hand, there have been a number of pilgrims who, having decided to stay longer in the Hejaz, possibly for good have not desired the extension but have pressed for the refund. In short, the system which has been in vogue in the past has not only given grounds for dissatisfaction but has also encouraged trade in tickets, the local shipping agents, for reasons of their own being by no means helpful in seeing that tickets are held by their rightful owners. These difficulties will disappear with the adoption of the system by the shipping companies of granting a refund on unused return tickets on demand. 7. Pilgrims return tickets were collected by the Malay pilgrimage officer on the arrival of the pilgrims at Jedda, and handed back to them on their return from Mecca. 8. As a result of representations made showing the advantages of this system, the agents of the Blue Funnel Line at Jedda have now been authorised to pav refunds on deceased pilgrims tickets locally, after such tickets have been endorsed by the Malay pilgrimage officer. This was much appreciated by relatives of deceased pilgrims.r 29 11% ^ 9. In order to prevent persons falsely reporting the death of a relative to the 5 Malay pilgrimage officer with a view to obtaining the refund on the pilgrim's ticket, ^ pilgrims were advised to report or insist on their sheikhs reporting the death of ^ their relatives to the Bait-el-Mal and to get from there the certificate of death r a j ; (production of which is insisted upon before the deceased's ticket is endorsed by the ■ - Malay pilgrimage officer), and not try to evade payment of death dues by ' forgetting ' to report it. 10. There was a certain amount of trafficking in return tickets, a fact which detracted to some extent from the utility of the system of registration. However, , with the introduction of the system of allowing refunds on unused tickets, this should not recur. aisei; visal Shipping. % 11. Judging from the absence of complaints from pilgrims, it may safely be ^assumed that they were satisfied with conditions obtaining on board ships. Never- i®,rtheless, the 'crowded' appearance of the pilgrim ships, deplored in previous ay pt reports, was still evident, but this will no longer be the case when the system of fspi feeding the pilgrims is put into effect and, it may be repeated, when all heavy luggage lis mi is not allowed to encumber deck space but is removed into the ships' holds. iyai|r 12. A number of better-class pilgrims have drawn attention to the desirability laklof having some accommodation available in pilgrim ships better than that obtaining on?, v on the bare deck. It is a matter which is worth the consideration of the shipping Md^companies concerned. Better-class pilgrims have perforce to travel in pilgrim ships as these alone make the journey direct, thus saving them not only considerable expense but also the complication of indirect travelling and they would, it is felt, be prepared to pay for better accommodation. Perhaps the provision of some half- dozen second-class berths, three cabins of two berths each possibly, in each pilgrim 3 optiship, or an arrangement whereby cabins could be fixed up and removed as occasion tkEdemanded, with a fare of about double that of the deck passage would be found e wkprofitable to the companies. it]oil 13. The total number of births during the voyage of the pilgrims to Jedda was feix and the total number of deaths twenty-five. The fact is interesting in showing imkthe indifference of the pilgrims to their state of health when embarking on the [ am ipilgr image. 'imk 14. A question was raised by the pilgrims during the period under review as whether the relatives of pilgrims who died before their quarantine dues (for mgeiKamaran and/or for Jedda) collected by the shipping companies were paid to the unfoifespective authorities concerned, are entitled to a refund of the money. maj; ^^Exfenses in the Hejaz. ese F; 15.

Practically all enquiries concerning the effects of deceased pilgrims b y uf] next-of-kin in Malaya were successfully dealt with. It should be remembered tna effects deposited in the Bait-el-Mal during the season do not reach the Britis consular authorities before the Malay pilgrimage officer leaves the country w Malaya at the end of the season. It would assist the Malay pilgrimage otlicer dealing with enquiries regarding deceased pilgrims' effects if officers issuing passes would see to it . {a) that the names of two or more accompanying relatives be given in the pilgn® passes; this to ensure that one of them will be allowed to receive the enecw from the Bait-el-Mal, in case of death of the pilgrim; „ (h) that the names of the pilgrims and their '' accompanying relatives be written in clear Jawi (Arabic) characters, as well as in English. In the case of enquiries for effects, district officers would also facilitate matters a t this end if, with a view to establishing whether or not a claim is genuine, tne would insist on the production of the pilgrim passes of the deceased by M accompanying relatives who claim the effects. It would also be useful if omce 15 would state in all applications— (i) The registration number of the passes and the year of issue. (ii) The year the pilgrim in question is reported to have died.31 (iii) The amount and nature of the effects with names of two witnesses (number of witnesses' passes to be given also) who may have knowledge concerning the effects. (iv) The name of the deceased's sheikh, if possible. Pilgrims returning to Malaya. 21. The Malay pilgrims, as in the case of the Indians, were embarked for their return journey in the order of their arrival in Jedda and were conveyed back to Malayan ports in eight ships of the Blue Funnel Line; the first of these sailed on the 27th May and the last on the 28th June. Appointment of a Malay Dresser. 22. A Malay dresser was seconded from the Fedferated Malay States for service in the Hejaz to assist in attending to the medical needs of Malay pilgrims. According to arrangements authorised, he was to be attached to the Indian sub- assistant surgeon sent from India for service at Mecca during the pilgrimage seasroi. Unfortunately, the latter did not arrive in Jedda until very late in the season. The Malay dresser, not being qualified himself to open the dispensary, was thus obliged to spend four months in Jedda instead of taking up his work at Mecca when needed. If the present system is continued, the Indian sub-assistant surgeon and the Malay dresser should arrive at the same time. This would mean either that the sub-assistant surgeon should arrive early in the year—earlier, in fact, than is necessary for purely Indian purposes—or else that the Malay dresser should arrive later in the season— that is to say, some time after the Malay pilgrims have arrived in Mecca and need medical attention. 23. It is a moot point, however, whether, under the present conditions, tne Indian dispensary being some distance from the Malay quarter, it is worth while engaging a Malay dresser at all. The ideal would be to open and equip a separate Malay dispensary situated »in the Malay quarter, properly staffed and in charge of a fully qualified'Malay doctor. It is doubtful, however, whether the expense is warranted, and also whether a fully qualified Malay doctor would be available and willing to come. • T 11 j • 24. The total number of cases treated by the Malay dresser m Jedda during the first four months of the year was forty-two. Of these, thirty-six were male and six female. The total number treated in Mecca was 422, of which 379 were male, thirty-eight female and five children. Staff. 25 Haii Abdul Majjid was seconded from the Federated Malay States Education Department for the fifth time to act as Malay pilgrimage officer attached to His Britannic Majesty's agent and consul at Jedda. As usual, he performed his duties with commendable zeal and ability, and it is a tribute to his work that the control of the Malay pilgrimage was carried out without a hitch. The question of the appointment of a permanent Malay pilgrimage officer, possibly with the title ot British (Malay) vice-consul, with a permanent clerk under him, has not as yet been settled. The services of a Malay officer to assist His Britannic Majesty s Minister at Jedda in dealing with affairs of Malay pilgrims are, however, in any case, indispensable. (12.)— West African Pilgrimage. According to the statistics issued by the local quarantine authorities^ 2,338 British West Africans and Nigerians arrived in Jedda this year from buakm, tlie recognised point of departure for the Hejaz. There is no doubt however, that a large number also travelled from Massowa in sambuqs and landed at the Hejazi ports of Lith and Qanfida, whence they proceeded on foot to Mecca. This occurred in spite of the undertaking given by the Italian Government m Rome on the 20th October 1 , 928, to the effect that they would not permit the transport ot pilgrims from Massowa to Jedda unless by steamship. From enquiries made it would appear that as many as 2,000 Nigerian pilgrims arrived at Lith and Qunfida from Massowa during the year, but it has been impossible to obtain an accurate estimate.2. In the return season a large number of applications were received from Nigerians for repatriation to their homes via the Sudan. A certain number of these had come to this country from the Sudan and Eritrea both before and after the introduction of the present pilgrimage laws by those Governments. All such applicants were informed that they should return to their homes by the same means and following the same route as on their journey to the Hejaz. In genuine cases of hardship, facilities were made, even for those who had arrived from Massowa, to return via the Sudan. Cases of destitution where relief was afforded were less numerous than in the previous year. 3. I have already commented in a separate despatch on the scheme proposed by the Nigerian Government for the control of the West African pilgrimage. I am in principle greatly in favour of such a scheme whereby it may be possible to co-ordinate the action of the Government of the Sudan, the Government of Nigeria and this agency in dealing with these pilgrims. (13.) — Sudanese Pilgrima^ge. The Hejaz quarantine authorities report that 1,371 Sudanese pilgrims were carried by Khedivial mail steamers to and from the Hejaz this year. These pilgrims, who were all in possession of pilgrim passports and return tickets, returned to the Sudan immediately after the pilgrimage. A few pilgrims lost their papers of identity at Mecca and Medina, but after enquiry duplicate documents were issued. The local agents of the Khedivial line, Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., were good enough to grant passages gratis to those pilgrims who were able to prove that they had actually left the Sudan for the Hejaz before the pilgrimage and had possessed documents at the outset. 2. Two separate contingents of pilgrims arrived in Jedda just after the departure of a ship for the Sudan and were compelled to remain in Jedda for ten days. Meetings of protest were held in the agency courtyard and on the roof. They were in each case invited to appoint a representative body to submit their grievance, but found great difficulty in doing so. In the case of the first contingent a deputa tion was eventually elected and received. In the case of the second contingent a sergeant of a mounted unit in the Sudan showed great ability in electing himself as sole delegate, ignoring with remarkable sang-froid the protests of his disappointed but duly accredited rivals. Both contingents dispersed quite happily when it was made abundantly clear to them that there was actually no ship for the time being to take them back. 3. Sixteen Sudanese pilgrims are reported to have died at Mecca and three in Jedda during the season. (14.)— Iraqi Pilgrimage. The number of Iraqis who entered the Hejaz through the port of Jedda this year is given as 486. The majority travelled via Syria, Palestine, Transjordan and -bgypt. Ninety-six reached the Hejaz via Indian ports. tt i ^L I rac li or foreign pilgrims are obliged to obtain pilgrim passes from the liealth Department in Iraq and to make a deposit of 100 rupees before leaving the country. This obligation greatly simplified the problem of dealing with destitutes. Instead of the waste of time and money, and unnecessary hardship, such as has been caused to the pilgrims in former years, when each individual case had in the first mstance to be referred to Bagdad, an applicant who had a good case was helped and dealt with in a few minutes, advances being made against the deposit. 3. No difficulties were experienced by the Iraqis in obtaining accommodation on boaid ship m the return season. Those Iraqi or foreign pilgrims who came from or via Iraq, and who were subject to the new regulations governing the Iraq pilgrimage, were as a rule in possession either of a return ticket or of a letter of guarantee, accepted by the local shipping agents for the homeward passage, in conformity with requirement No. 3 of the conditions laid down for the issul of a pilgrimage pass. A few pilgrims lost their return travel documents, but the shipping companies issued duplicate papers once they were convinced that the- applications were genuine.33 ^ (15.)— Palestinians. ^ t &gt; nui ? 1 ^ er of Palestinians issued with pilgrim passes by the authorities in Palestine this year is reported by them to have been 563, an increase of ninety-two iQetai on last year s figures. The majority of these pilgrims came via Egypt, and travelled assot, to and from the Hejaz on ships of the Khedivial Mail Line. i wctf 2. According to the official statistics issued by the health authorities, seven Palestinian pilgrims died at Mecca. No deaths are recorded as having occurred in lepri- Jedda. ^ 3. In the return season no pilgrim applied to this agency for advances on the possi| sums deposited by them in Palestine, and, consequently, no cases of destitution were of | brought to the notice of this agency. The Government of Palestine increased the compulsory deposit by £1 as compared with the figure of the previous year. (16.)— Sarawak Pilgrimage. Twenty-two natives of Sarawak arrived on pilgrimage. There were no cases of &amp; im : disease or of destitution among them. 36 m rnedtii papers fere is?: , were?; ■e tki dpOSS; ; after!

Among others the Emir of Joalan (Muscat) is perhaps worth mentioning. The Emir of Joalan busied himself 'to some extent with political matters and with estab lishing a friendly relationship with the King. A large number of better class Indians including high officials, barristers, landlords and merchants came on pil grimage. A notable Syrian who came was the Emir Skekib Arslan, the notorious nationalist. He was entertained as a royal guest and accommodation was arranged for him with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. +1,0 f com T iaratlve abundance of motor buses and keen competition anion' the several motor companies Caused the rate of transport between Mecca and Medina to drop from £15 to £9 inclusive of the Government s ' Kushan ' This however while making the journey to Medina easier for large numbers of the poorei pilgrims, did much harm to trade generally. Nearly 60% of the goods stored by merchants m Mecca and Jedda for the pilgrimage season could not be sold as a great many pi gnms went on to Medina immediately and had no money on their return for disbursement m the country. The Government is likely to be a loser on I q4 a nT aS the ™fprobably import considerably less goods for the 930 pilgrimage and there will be a corresponding diminution in the Customs re WWn m - re T general merchandise.

I greatly regret the delay in furnishing this report, which has been held up owing to the absence of the Indian vice-consul on leave, hi&amp; subsequent illness, and the paucity of career staff. An effort will be made to furnish the 1931 report in the autumn. 2. This report has been prepared in its final shape by Mr. Wikeley and myself from material supplied by the officers in charge of the special pilgrimage sections of the Legation, Munshi Ihsanullah, Haji Abdul Majid and Captain B. W. Seager. I wish to record my appreciation of the excellent work done by those officers, and may, without making any invidious distinction, draw your special attention to that of Munshi Ihsanullah, who had to deal with very large numbers of pilgrims of a different type. The work of Dr. Abdul Hamid, the Indian medical officer attached to the Legation, also deserves high commendation. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to India, Singapore, Cairo, Khartum, Lagos, Jerusalem and Bagdad. 5 I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure in No. 1. Report on the Pilgrimage of 1930. (1) Introductory and General. THE close of the 1929 pilgrimage season coincided with^ a recrudescence of the rebellion under Eaisal-ad-Dawish and other leaders in Nejd. It was not finally quelled until early in January 1930, when the principal leaders, having escaped across the frontiers, surrendered in Koweit and Iraq. This long continuance of unsettled conditions might have had an adverse effect on the 1930 pilgrimage, and consequently on the finances of the Hejaz-Nejd Government, at a moment when they were emerging from an acute internal crisis. The revolt in the region between Mecca and Riadh had, however, been crushed in the autumn of 1929. Sufficient secrecy was maintained regarding the general situation to prevent its becoming known to intending pilgrims in such a way as to alarm them. The Javanese, always the earliest to arrive, came forward normally, as did other pilgrims in due course. 2. The Haj festival in 1930 began on Wednesday, the 7th May, although, as on other occasions, there was controversy in India and the Hejaz regarding the date of the new moon's appearance. It had been hoped by many that the feast would begin on a Friday, and that the pilgrimage would therefore be a source of sevenfold blessing. This brought to the Hejaz many pilgrims, who had already accomplished the pilgrimage in previous years. Much disappointment resulted. 3. The climatic conditions at Muna and Arafat were favourable. There was no epidemic disease, and the number of deaths at those places was considerably fewer than in previous years. The mortality during the actual festival was officially put at 123 deaths, mainly due to old age and other ordinary causes, among a total attendance of about 100,000 pilgrims. It may be mentioned incidentally that the reduction in the number of deaths reacted unfavourably on the mutawwifs, when opportunities for coverting to their own use the effects of pilgrims dying at Muna and Arafat were curtailed. [5725] b4. Detailed statistics of the pilgrimage are given in section (2). The total number of pilgrims from overseas was substantially the same as in 1J.29, and is estimated at between 81,000 and 85,000. Ihere was some vanation in the elements of various nationalities. The numbers from Java and Malaya were not affected by the slump in rice and rubber in those countries. The total of Malay pilgrims, indeed increased from 1,406 in 1929 to 2,609 in 1930. The number of pilgrims from Indian ports fell from 19,656 in 1929 to 16,697 m 1930; and the number of British Indians from 15,146 in 1929 to 11,061 in 1930. This latter decrease was attributed to political unrest and financial difficulties in India. Although the various increases and decreases more or less cancelled out, the average wealth of the overseas pilgrims was much less than in the previous year. The purchasing capacity of the average pilgrim, who formerly spent a good deal on such things as mementos of the Holy Land, was lower than in the past. It was still further reduced by the increased demands of the Government and other necessary charges. Thus, the camel hire to Arafat was doubled without previous notice, and that from Mecca to Jedda, payable at a time when the pilgrim's resources are already apt to be getting exhausted, was raised from Rs. 15/8/- to Rs. 28. This produced a comparative stagnation of local trade. Sales of goods were stated by merchants to be less by two-thirds than in 1929. The market was overstocked. Traders were compelled to realise at low prices, but even the consequent competition and cutting of prices did little to increase demand. 5. The number of pilgrims from the Hejaz itself and the interior of Arabia was considerably less than in 1929, owing, it is said, to financial stringency in the Hejaz and the unsettlement created elsewhere by the 1929 rebellion. On the other hand, an unusually large number of members of the Royal Family, and officials, &amp;c., from Nejd took part in the pilgrimage. They were allowed the privilege of going to Muna and Arafat by motor car, an unprecedented mode of pilgrim-approach to those places, and one which greatly incommoded others. About 300 cars and buses took the road to Arafat at the same time as the camels, making their way through the lines of the latter. Much confusion ensued; litters were overturned, and a good many pilgrims sustained injury. The commandeering of houses at Mecca and Muna from their owners, or pilgrims who had booked them ahead, in order to provide accommodation for the Nejd visitors was a further cause of complaint, as pilgrims who had secured accommodation, arranged for water supplies, &amp;c., were driven into tents. Among the houses commandeered was that maintained by the State of Hyderabad at Muna. This had happened before in 1929, and the leader of the Hyderabad party was, in 1930, provided with a letter, which it was hoped Avould afford them protection. They were, however, again deprived of the house and the water which had been stored for their use. 6. The Nejdis and the motor cars caused inconvenience in other ways. Although a separate road for cars was provided at Muna to facilitate tlhe performance of ceremonies and prevent congestion in the main thoroughfare, the distinction was not observed until the King, on returning from Mecca after the festival, himself saw the state of attairs and personally lashed the drivers who had broken the rules. His slaves in Mecca behaved offensively. The Indian vice-consul saw them pelt pilgrims with melon-rinds. One of the objects of this insult was one Abdul-Hai, a teacher of Arabic at Oxford and a Royal guest. He complained to the King, who was understood to have punished the offenders. . ?• The security which Ibn baud has established on the roads 'was well maintained, but there were many complaints in 1930 of petty thefts and pilferage at Muzalfa where pilgrims stop for a night on the way from Muna to Arafat. 1 he state of the roads generally has not improved. The stretch of 10 miles of good road made betw een Jedda and Mecca in 1927 has been allowed to deteriorate, and was m 1930 no better than the rest of the highway. The usual water-troughs and first-aid sheds were provided on the road from Mecca to Arafat and an attempt w as made at lighting it. Owing to the financial stringency however, - ere was a paucity of doctors, and little medical help was available in the sheds. e\\ cars plied at Muna and Arafat to pick up sick and infirm persons, but there was little demand for them, and they were used by the doctors to transport pilgrims S fellow-countrymen, to the further inconvenience of other USe ^ f motor l cars ^ 01 \ pilgrim transport has had various incidental consequences. The camel-owners have suffered severely, and are beingturned into a discontented class. Accidents, due to bad roads and the incompetent driving of cars, were numerous in 1930. There were complaints of loss to pilgrims caused by their property falling from cars, and less trouble bein^ taken than formerly by drivers, motor-owners and public authorities to recover it. A serious fire, involving the destruction of eight motor vehicles, broke out on or about the 22nd May at the Masajid halt, on the road between Jedda and Medina. The question of transport will be dealt with more fully in a separate section. 9. There was again no Moslem Conference at Mecca in 1930. The King gave a large banquet, which was attended by Moslems of all nations, including a good many Indians. Syrians were much in evidence; Javanese conspicuous by their absence. The King delivered a speech dealing largely with the need for unity among Moslems. His assertion of Wahhabi tenets elicited a protest from an indiscreet Egyptian theologian, whose outburst brought the party to an end. 10. The dispersal of the pilgrimage was effected in generally satisfactory conditions. Much complaint was caused, however, by the action of the authorities in detaining at Mecca pilgrims who did not intend to go to Medina. Those who did intend to do this were first released; a novel procedure, designed, it was alleged, to make sure that the Government would get the heavy Koshan tax payable on the journey to Medina; the theory being that if they came to Jedda with the other pilgrims many of them would abandon the Medina pilgrimage from lack of funds or a desire to go home earlier. This is a further indication of the effects of unbalanced finance. General depression and the stagnation of trade already referred to drove the Government to extortionate devices, while the extravagance of expenditure in certain directions, including that of a Royal Family increasingly inclined to luxury, does nothing to lighten the debit side of the budget. 11. Homeward shipping arrangements were on the whole satisfactory. Hardship was, however, caused in the case of Indian pilgrims by the transaction whereby Messrs. Turner Morrison and Co. held those ships which had imported Indian pilgrims at the disposal of the Khedivial Mail Company for the repatria tion of Egyptians. This and a particular instance in which the conduct of the officers of the steamship ' Shuja ' gave rise to complaint will be dealt with later. 12. Indian pilgrims were for a time threatened with serious difficulty owing to the circulation of forged Indian currency notes. Local money-changers and merchants were unable to distinguish the forgeries from genuine notes, but confidence was restored by arrangements which it proved possible to make with the leading houses in Jedda. From investigations made with great zeal by the Indian vice-consul, Munshi Ihsanullah, during his leave in Syria after the pilgrimage, it appeared that the forged notes were manufactured in Europe and marketed by intermediaries in Syria. As a result of the Munshi's activity, serious steps were subsequently taken to run the distributors of the forgeries to earth. 13. The arrangements for the recovery of the effects of deceased pilgrims were not so good as in 1929, a considerable proportion of the cash and other property remaining in the hands of the mutawwifs. The average estate of a deceased pilgrim, which in 1928 was estimated at 34 rupees, in 1930 fell as low as 18 rupees; moreover, there was considerable delay in the delivering of the effects to the Legation. 14. The number of destitute Indian pilgrims repatriated at Government expense was large, being 387 as against 139 in 1929. The main causes of this increase were (1) a large number of pilgrims coming by the overland route and (2) an increase in the number of those who travelled on single tickets, having made a 'non-return' declaration in India. This latter category come mostly from Karachi. 15. A large number of better class Indians came on pilgrimage; the following names may be mentioned : Nawab Mir Masud Alam'Khan, C.I.E., of Belha, Surat; Mr. Badi-uz-Zaman, M.L.A.; Mr. A. Eahim, C.I.E., M.L.G., of Bengal; and Khan Bahadur Nabi Bux, M.L.C., of Bombay. Among Indian political undesirables who came to the Hejaz may be mentioned Moulvi Nesar Ahmed, of Cawnpore, Ismail Ghaznavi and Khaja Ghulum Mohammed. The last named is said to have carried on anti-British propaganda on board the ship in which he travelled to this country. 16. Many of the factors mentioned in the preceding paragraphs threw additional work on the Indian vice-consul and his staff. It must be remembered [5725] b 2\ u t % l*r\ u j that every reform designed to promote the well-being of pilgrims entails a greater amount of routine work in this section of the British Legation; and every deterioration in the conditions prevailing m the Hejaz, whether it be abuse by mutawwifs or transporters, loss of effects by pilfering, &amp;c., the ma version of deceased pilgrims' estates or any other form of hardship, involves a still further increase of work. . , p .i tt • -i? . n 17 The published and confidential reports of the Haj xLncjuiry Cominittee, which sat in India from April to December 1929, were published early in 1930. These valuable reports cover a very wide range of questions, including many of a difficult and some of a contentious nature which require further exploration. A number of the questions relate to arrangements in the Hejaz or arrangements in India producing effects in the Hejaz. His Majesty's Legation m Jedda has been consulted on several important recommendations made by the committee. It is greatly regretted that their full consideration in Jedda has been delayed by staff changes consequent on the conversion of the British agency into a Legation, by the absence for some months of Munshi Ihsanullah on well-deserved leave of absence and by paucity of career staff throughout a period of considerable 18. The other elements in the pilgrimage of special British interest call for little mention in this introductory section. Measures for securing better control of the pilgrimage from West Africa were still under consideiation throughout 1930, and things remained as they were during that year s pilgrimage. No large number of Nigerian pilgrims has to be repatriated as destitutes, thanks to the operation of the compulsory return ticket system for the passage fiom Suakin. The pilgrims from Africa included a Nigerian chieftain named Ibrahim Igbirra. Afghan destitutes were repatriated at the expense of the local Government. The Turkish consulate did nothing for them in 1930. The Malay pilgrimage worked satisfactorily. The pilgrims from Malaya included the Prime Minister of Kelantan. Two cousins of the Sheikh of Bahrein also made the pilgrimage and were entertained as Royal guests. 19. The pilgrimage was marred by one great tragedy, namely, the burning of the steamship 'Asia ' in Jedda Harbour on the 22nd May. This vessel, which was due to sail on that date, but had been detained in harbour for another night, caught fire about 7 p.m . The fire broke out forward, and, as the ship was swinging to wind anchored by the bow, it soon spread to all parts of the ship. Approximately 1,550 pilgrims bound for the Yemen and French Somaliland were aboard at the time, but as a result of the prompt action of the captains and crews of the other pilgrim ships in harbour, who immediately proceeded to the rescue, most of these were saved. The total number of deaths is estimated at 106. 20. As in 1929 and 1928, no ' Mahmal' was sent from Egypt in 1930. It is hoped, however, that the Hejaz Government may in future, in consideration of the monetary contributions which would probably accompany the Mahrnal, permit this old custom to be revived. In the present circumstances the Hejazi Government have themselves to spend a considerable sum annually on the manufacture of a covering for the Kaaba. It may be noted in this connexion that negotiations are at present being carried on between the two countries, and that the attitude of the Hejazi Government is a conciliatory one. One proof of this is that the Egyptian medical mission this year, although it was not permitted to import its own ambulances, was provided by the local Government with cars- bearing Hejazi flags—and was transported to Arafat and Muna in motor ambulance buses, also supplied by the Hejazi authorities. Permission was given for the Egyptian flag to be flown over the mission's residence at Mecca. After the pilgrimage was over, however, a good deal of ill-feeling was caused in Hejazi Government circles by the action of the Alexandria Quarantine Board in declaring the pilgrimage infected, although the Hejazi Government had officially declared it clean. This was due to the discovery of possible symptoms of cholera among many returning pilgrims at Tor, and the serious view taken by the board was confirmed by a report from Massowah that an unmistakable case of cholera had been ascertained there. (2) Statistics. 21. The estimated number of pilgrims coming on Haj from overseas in ,1930 was approximately the same as in 1929. As usual it is impossible to obtain.coming from that country were in 1930, for the first time in the history of the Malay pilgrimage, allowed to proceed to Jedda, after medical examination at Kamaran, but without landing, in the same way as the Javanese pilgrims. 23 a . The pilgrim ships coming from India, with the exception of two steamers, one from Bombay and Karachi, and the other from Calcutta direct, whose passengers were inoculated against cholera, were made to land their pilgrims at Kamaran in order to undergo the usual formalities. This led, as in previous years, to violent criticism and complaints of the same nature as those described in the pilgrimage report for 1929. 23 b . N ow that the Haj Enquiry Committee has pronounced in favour of compulsory inoculation against cholera (paragraphs 261 jf of published report) it is to be hoped that the Government of India will take steps to enforce this by legislation as soon as possible. The advantages of such inoculation cannot be over-estimated. In view of the difficulties which arise at Kamaran and for other reasons it is most desirable that Indian pilgrims should be subject to the same rules and enjoy the same consequent benefits as the Javanese and Malayans. The recommendations of the committee in favour of promoting voluntary inoculation pending legislation have had little effect. 23c. After leaving Kamaran all ships were found clean with the exception of the steamship ' Arabistan,' which arrived in Jedda on the 18th February with two cases of small-pox on board. These two cases were isolated and sent to the local hospital for treatment, while the rest of the pilgrims on board were allowed to land without restriction. Ships returning to India and Malaya after the pilgrimage were not required to call at Kamaran in view of the satisfactory report on the sanitary aspects of the pilgrimage furnished by the Indian doctor attached to the Legation and an official declaration by the Hejazi authorities that the Haj was clean. A guarded intimation to agents by His Majesty's Minister that it would probably be unnecessary to call at Kamaran was confirmed by the Government of India and tacitly by the Government of the Straits Settlements after they had been tele graphically informed. Sir A. Ryan subsequently raised the question whether the Legation should be empowered in certain circumstances to dispense pilgrim ships definitely from calling at Kamaran on return voyages, in view of the desirability of not detaining ships during the rush period, pending a decision being taken-by the authorities in India and Malaya. Tor. 24. Although the Haj was declared clean by the Hejazi Government, the International Quarantine Board at Alexandria decided, in view of the discovery at Tor of numerous symptoms pointing to the possible existence of cholera among returning pilgrims, to declare the pilgrimage infected. As a result of medical examination of the first shipload, vibrios presenting the appearance of cholera were found in nine specimens out of a total of 140 cases examined. Agglutinating vibrios were detected in one of the suspect cases and non-agglutinating vibrios in the remaining eight. In the event it was found that among a total number of 20,730 specimens of stools examined at Tor, forty-five showed the presence of vibrios; two agglutinating and the rest non-agglutinating. The decision of the Quarantine Board was, in the first instance, provisional, but it was confirmed for the remainder of the season on receipt of news from the Government of Eritrea that a pilgrim had died the same day in circumstances which were regarded as showing unmistakably that he had had cholera. As a result of this decision all pilgrims returning northward through the Red Sea were subjected to quarantine at Tor, where the Egyptian pilgrims had to stay for eight days and the non-Egyptians for five days. The total number of pilgrims who thus passed was 24,537. Of these, 17,230 were Egyptians and 7,307 were foreigners. The Hejazi Government, having themselves declared the Haj clean, naturally resented the decision of the International Quarantine Board, and severe criticism was indulged in both in the press and officially to the effect that the Alexandria Board had acted without justification. The Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs forwarded to the British Legation and presumably to other missions a copy of a report signed by thirteen doctors declaring that the Haj was free from all epidemic or contagious disease, together with another reportsigned by twenty-six doctors, both natives and foreigners, including the Russian doctor of the Soviet Legation who specialises m bacteriology and tropical diseases. The Hejazi Government also laid ''s grievances before the French Government, who transmitted the papers to the International Health Office. The latter was embarrassed bv certain technical considerations, but gave qualified approval to the action of the Alexandria Board as an emergency measure taken in exceptional circumstances. The Health Office suggested that a formula might be devised for future similar occasions, which would enable necessary precautions to be taken without definitely declaring the pilgrimage infected. The incident led to a suggestion being made unofficially on behalf of His Majesty s Govern ment in the United Kingdom to the Hejazi Government that they would find it useful to adhere to the Rome Convention of 1907, and thus secure permanent representation in the International Health Office at I aris. Suakin. 25. Following on the decision of the Alexandria Board, the Sudan Govern ment also took precautionary measures to restrict the number of returning pilgrims allowed to land in the Sudan. Those permitted to do so were subjected to quarantine, normally for five days, at Suakin. Jedda. 26. None of the pilgrim steamers was quarantined, with the exception of an Italian boat which carried about 900 pilgrims from Hodeidah and had not called at Kamaran. The pilgrims on board were sent to the Quarantine Islands, where, it is understood, they were merely detained; no arrangements for disinfecting their persons or effects were made. A few individuals suffering from small-pox coming by other ships were not sent to the islands, but were removed to the local hospital for treatment. The local authorities on learning in June that Port Said was declared infected with plague, tried to prevent pilgrims embarking on a Blue Funnel steamer calling at Jedda on its way from Port Said to Singapore. The difficulty was, however, got over by representations to the King. There were again in 1930 only two official doctors for inspecting ships. It was, therefore, not uncommon that considerable delay occurred to steamers, of which the daily number on occasions reached as many as eight or nine, before they were declared clean. The quarantine yard at the quay in Jedda provided only limited accommoda tion and seemed fully packed and overcrowded. Owing to the great congestion the pilgrims had to struggle hard to pass through the little gates leading to the custom-house. Here the dhow hire is collected and declarations of -choice of mutawwifs (Su'al) taken before they are allowed to pass. The local authorities, on the unofficial suggestion of the Indian vice-consul, opened a second gate. This, however, did not prove quite adequate. The hardy and rowdy Persians and Egyptians, caring little for the local rules and regulations, often upset every arrangement, and tried to get through first at the expense of the pilgrims of a less robust type. A handful of young and weak police constables posted there could do nothing to control the situation and had often to fly for their own safety. On many occasions the Indian vice-consul and his staff themselves had to control the situation. (4) Health. 27. This important subject has been dealt with in detail in previous years, and it is gratifying to see that it is engaging the careful attention of the authorities concerned. 28. In the Hejaz Administration itself, however, little improvement can be noted. The following list taken from the Mecca weekly newspaper shows* the attendance and mortality in the Government hospitals'for the ten months ending December 1930.9 Name of Disease. Whooping cough Dysentery Para-typhoid Typhoid Puerperal fever Smallpox Measles Meningitis Leprosy Syphilis Diphtheria Fever ... Dengue Mumps Erysipelas Anthrax Consumption No. of Cases. No. of Deaths. 44 17 1,647 388 90 62 160 147 79 64 217 97 143 92 53 44 3 2 109 15 5 5 3 3 20 16 8 1 3 1 1 1 2 2 2,590 958 29. The mortality, it will be observed, is high, and there is no mention of surgical cases. In 1928 a Syrian surgeon was brought to the country by the Government. He performed twenty-seven operations in all, all of which were fatal, some patients dying on the operation table, others within a day or two after the operation. The surgeon then departed and since that date no Govern ment surgeon has been available. 30. The medical officers employed by the Government are nearly all Syrians who, in addition to being unqualified and inexperienced, make it their object to line their pockets rather than afford relief to pilgrims. The high fee of £1 is charged for each visit and sometimes even when the patient comes to the doctor's consulting room; this fee even the local residents cannot afford, not to speak of the average pilgrim of moderate means. The charges for medicines are, moreover, unusually high. The result of these various considerations is to render it practically impossible for pilgrims of average means to visit the hospitals. 31. The hospitals themselves, apart from their inability to meet the needs of the pilgrims, are equally unable to provide sound medical aid for the residents of the country. From a study of the list given above, it will be seen that the total number of patients admitted to all the thirteen hospitals in the country during ten months amounted to 2,590, and this among the whole popula tion of the country plus 82,000 pilgrims, making a monthly attendance of approximately twenty patients per hospital. This by no means implies that the country is free from disease, for it is rather more liable to disease than other countries in view of the annual presence of a large number of pilgrims of all sorts and conditions, bad water supply, abundance of mosquitos, and the general ignorance of the public and their negligence in observing the elementary rules of hygiene and sanitation. 32. As regards the central hospital at Mecca, no improvements have been made on the conditions previously obtaining. The number of doctors employed was inadequate and was even less than in 1929. No arrangements were made to segregate infectious patients from others, and cases of syphilis and leprosy, or of other such contagious diseases, were to be seen lying side by side with other patients. These conditions can only be traced to general financial stringency, although the Hejaz Government collected last year about 6 rupees per pilgrim, through the mutawwifs, in addition to the quarantine fee of over £1 per pilgrim collected through the shipping companies. The sheds erected last year on the Mecca-Arafat Road for providing medical relief were again opened this year,, and 1,416 pilgrims were officially shown to have received medical aid from them, but the number cannot be vouched for. 33. The foregoing observations are intended to throw light on the sanitary and hygienic state of the country, and should be considered in connexion with the scheme at present being examined by the Government of India for the provision of better and more adequate medical help for Indian pilgrims [5725] c10 • i • i : 4-1,^ 1 /-t-vi mo coaann TVi^i Jedda where tanks and cisterns of water teem with mosquitos. Dysentery is endemic and was responsible for 388 deaths out of 958 from contagious and infectious diseases. A large number of Indian pilgrims suffered from this disease. Flies, contaminated water, and the use of common latrines are the chief causes of this and are likely to remain so until the whole question of water supply and latrines has been scientifically studied; there is little likelihood of this being done in the near future. 35. A percentage of 8-2 or 2,622 deaths were reported among the Javanese; Malayans had nearly the same percentage, i.e., 203 deaths, while among the Indian pilgrims a marked reduction in mortality occurred, the number of deaths being; 295, which reduces the percentage to less than 3, i.e., half that of last year, The 'total number of deaths during the four days stay at Muna and Arafat was, according to the official report, only 123 in about 100,000. These were attributed mainly to old age and ordinary diseases; sun-stroke, dysentery and malaria being responsible for a small number. The temperature in the shade at Arafat was 105°, while during the three days' stay at Muna it went down to 100° and below, Sanitary Conditions: General. 36. With the exception of a little street cleaning and sprinkling of scanty water by a car on the main thoroughfares, no improvements were made by the Government during the pilgrimage this year. Filth, dirt, dust and mosquitos abounded everywhere and made life almost unbearable. No attention has yet been paid to the most important question of the construction of public lavatories, Consequently, as usual, the pilgrims utilised the nearest side of the street or any convenient wall for the purpose. Moreover, the soak pits beneath the ground floors of houses which collect all human excreta and other dirt and filth are seldom cleaned or disinfected; the mutawwifs, it is true, were instructed to use phenyol, but its use being expensive, it was used by very few. Besides this, the houses in which the average pilgrim is accommodated at Muna are for the most part in an advanced state of dilapidation and full of vermin. Arrangements for the slaughter of sacrificial animals at Muna, as reported in 1929, were satisfactory. Nevertheless, a good number of animals were slaughtered near the camps and left to decompose. The resulting stench was so overpowering that an Egyptian pilgrim, in the presence of the Indian vice-consul, in the open Darbar of Ibn Saud criticised the unbearable conditions due to the negligence of the Hejaz sanitary authorities. Water Supply. 37. There was no difficulty in obtaining water at Jedda, Mecca, Muna or Arafat. The price of a tin of 4 gallons of water varied from 2 to 4 piastres (annas). The abundance of water supply in the two last-named places was mainly due to the efforts of the Zubaida Committee, which had caused the canal supplying water to those places to be cleaned for many furlongs. The Govern- ment imposed a tax of 1 rupee per pilgrim for the maintenance and upkeep of the canal, which amount is collected by the committee through the mutawwifs; in addition, many benevolent Indians donated large sums for this purpose. The committee is under the guidance of a British Indian subject domiciled at Mecca, who is an honest worker and who ensures that the amount collected is honestly and rightly spent. Government of India Dispensaries. £ ^ ^2^ num b er of Indian pilgrims who attended the dispensaries from the 10th May to the 1st July, 1930, was 4,810 at Jedda, and 5,008 at Mecca; Mortality.11 iie^ i pIlfE; at | while the total number of patients throughout the year, including Hejazis, was 25,359.

For many years the Indian doctor has been prohibited from indulging in private practice at Mecca. Well-to-do pilgrims, however, who want his services at their houses, for which they are of course prepared to pay, often object to this restriction, thereby giving rise to a somewhat difficult problem. On the one hand, there is the consideration due to the well-to-do class of pilgrims, especially ladies, who as a result of distance and heat, &amp;c., cannot come in person for treatment. On the other hand, if private practice were to be allowed, the doctor would naturally spend comparatively little time in the dispensary, to the great detriment of the poorer class of pilgrims. Under the circumstances, it was thought best that Dr. Abdul Hamid should attend better- class patients, especially respectable ladies, in their houses free, as an experiment. This privilege was only consented to persons who were known to be deserving of it both as regards their social status and the gravity of their ailment. These domiciliary visits, however, took up a considerable portion of the doctor's time and energy on account of the distance he often had to traverse in order to visit the patients. Before the actual Haj period the doctor was able to use a car for this purpose, but during the Haj, and for a few days before and after it, no cars eredi were allowed to circulate in Mecca, except those belonging to the Government and those used by the Egyptian Medical Mission. In some cases pilgrims who jn t|{ could quite well have attended at the dispensary in person, tried to take advantage of the system of free domicilary visits and induce the doctor to visit them in their houses. It is suggested that in order to put a stop to this abuse, and to limit the number of calls on his time and energy, the doctor should be allowed to charge a fee sufficient fo cover the necessary motor or cab hire— , provided always that the system of such domiciliary visits is continued in future., cca, ^ to't' Staff. ! 40. A military sub-assistant surgeon was again deputed by the Govern- ment of India to work at the Mecca dispensary. He arrived here on the 25th April and left for Mecca on the 27th. He was, as usual, assisted by a ' aI1 J Malay dresser. The latter's services, however, proved useful neither to the e 1111111 Indians nor to his own pilgrims because he was unable to speak Hindustani, pD r P 0?f ,( and because Malay pilgrims live in a distant quarter of the town far from the ikdatj dispensary. This question is at present under discussion, and it seems probable edis* that—with the consent of the Government of the Straits Settlements—Malay pilgrims shall be attended by the Javanese doctor attached to the Dutch Legation,, and that an Indian compounder will be sent to take the place of the Malay dresser on Dr. Abdul Hamid's staff. Dr. Hamid Hussan performed his duties , (jispet satisfactorily. OOM 5 [5725] c 9HBr , llWIIW'li iW /aVV 12 Dr. Abdul Hamid, on account of the fact that pilgrim ships continued arriving until the latest date which permitted of pilgiims reaching Mecca in time for the Hcij, could not proceed to IVIeccfi before the 28th Apiil. He w^s accompanied by two compounders, and after his anival the woik of medical relief reached its highest point and was vigorously and efficiently carried out. The daily number of pilgrims attending the dispensary was considerable, and during their short stay there both the doctors and compounders had their time fully occupied. The dispensary was kept open throughout the day and also in the evening. Unfortunately, however, as his presence was required at Jedda, Dr. Abdul Hamid could not'remain in Mecca for long, and had to return to Jedda on the second day after the Haj. In his absence the Mecca dispensary was left in the charge of the sub-assistant surgeon. All told, the Government of India can rest assured that their present medical mission to the Hejaz achieves a great measure 01 success; if and when, however, the enlarged medical scheme which is now under consideration by the Govern ment of India is realised, then it is hoped that even more adequate and efficient arrangements will be possible. At Jedda, Dr. Abdul Hamid was single-handed. Nevertheless during the pilgrim season, in addition to the usual working hours, he opened the dispensary in the afternoon, which was of considerable benefit to the pilgrims. The daily attendance at the Jedda dispensary was over 100 patients. (5) Transport. 41. As usual, motor vehicles, camels and arabias were used for the transport of pilgrims. Motor Traffic. —No appreciable improvement over the conditions prevailing last year was noticeable during the season under review. It is true that the number of vehicles was, according to official statistics, greater than last year, being slightly over 1,000; in point of fact, however, a good number of these were old machines, and, as deterioration is very rapid in this country, were either totally unfit for work during the greater part of the season or so unreliable as to be' impossible for long journeys to Medina, &amp;c., being used only for work between Jedda and Mecca. The financial position of the car owners being poor, old and unreliable cars could not be replaced. The number of touring cars showed a decrease, for they, owing to the fact that petrol and other expenses are the same as for lorries which carry thrice as many passengers, bring in little or no profit to the owners. This year touring cars, in more than one case, were used as advertisements to attract potential passengers rather than as actual conveyances. The well-to-do and better class pilgrims, who always prefer to travel by cars and are prepared to pay for it, were, on leaving Mecca for Medina, given seats in smart-looking cars. But on their reaching Jedda they were turned out and transferred to old and uncomfortable cars, while the original cars returned again to Mecca to dupe more pilgrims. This gave rise to many complaints, and it was only with great difficulty that matters could be put right. Motor owners in general who fared very badly in 1929 were even worse off in 1930, there being no 'naqaba,' a system by which pilgrims were in previous years distributed among the various motor companies in turn. The result of this was that as each pilgrim ship reached Jedda there were a very large number of cars ready to transport its passengers to Mecca. A price-cutting campaign then ensued, and motor car hire went considerably lower than that fixed by the Government. This did not, as might have been expected, benefit the pilgrims, but only the mutawwifs, who gave their pilgrims to the lowest bidders and charged their clients at the fixed rate, putting the difference into their own pockets. The Javanese pilgrims, who follow their mutawwifs blindly, were the worst sufferers. Indian pilgrims, however, paid even less than the Government fixed rate, as the head of the mutawwifs had been warned beforehand by the Indian vice-consul not to make exorbitant charges. Nevertheless the mutawwifs and their agents were no losers, but still made a profit at the expense of the motor owners. Despite this competition, the motor companies were unable to attract all the pilgrims to their own cars, for the mutawwifs who had cars of their own naturally tried to meet their own requirements first. 42. The complaints made in regard to motor transport were far more numerous and of more varied and serious nature than in preceding years. I 11/ 1 13 some cases the Government alone was entirely responsible, while in others it was the fault of the motor owners or the mutawwifs. As a matter of fact, no other single question connected with the pilgrimage, with the exception of the booking of tickets and shipping affairs generally, caused such trouble as did the question of motor transport. First in the time and foremost in magnitude of the difficulties experienced in this connexion was the Government's order, issued after the pilgrimage, according to which only those pilgrims who intended to visit Medina were allowed to leave Mecca, while the others, a very large number compared to the former, who desired to return to their homes were detained. This caused vehement and universal protest. The practice heretofore was that pilgrims coming to Jedda en route for their homes were allowed to proceed first. The journey between Mecca and Jedda being a short one—about three hours by car—the motor vehicles used to bring to Jedda pilgrims who intended to sail immediately to their homes were employed for a week or so only, after which they were free to carry pilgrims to Medina. On the other hand, it takes over a week for a car to reach and return from Medina, so that this order caused great delay to pilgrims who did not wish to visit Medina. This departure from the old practice would appear to have been actuated by a selfish consideration lest the pilgrims Avho started out with the intention of visiting Medina once they reached Jedda would abandon their intention and thus not enable the Govern ment to collect the 'koshan.' As a matter of fact, the mischief was the result of the action of certain motor owners who happen to exercise great influence with the Government and who are said to have advised the Government to enforce this regulation so as to increase their own profits. Excepting these few, all the other motor companies had, as usual, collected motor hire for Jedda and Medina in advance for the latter journey; it was promised that cars would be provided a week after the Haj. On the introduction of the new regulation the majority of the vehicles went to Medina; only a small number remaining at Mecca. In the meantime the detained pilgrims were allowed to go, and the Government forced those motor owners who had collected the hire in advance to arrange for the conveyance of these pilgrims. Cars were few, time was short and the pilgrims were numerous and clamorous. Motor hire went up as a natural result. The motor owners had to provide cars at any rate—considerably higher than that which they had originally charged—and to put up with the loss. Great hardships were entailed on pilgrims during their compulsory detention in a hot and unwholesome climate. 43. Another peculiar regulation which formed the subject of complaints was that a driver was only allowed to take 4 gallons of petrol in his car when going to Mecca from Jedda, so that on the return journey he had to purchase fresh supplies in the capital. In more than one case this quantity of petrol, as a result of mechanical disorders, leakage, &amp;c., was consumed before Mecca was reached, and the cars and their passengers had to stop on the way—a lonely, sandy and a shadeless track. The pilgrims therefore, more often than not, had to buy petrol from other passing motor buses at a very high price in order to reach their destination. In this case also it seems that certain influential persons who sell petrol at Mecca were to blame, as, in the absence of any such regulation, they would have had no sale for it because motor drivers when going to Mecca would have taken—as they used to do in the past—a sufficient supply of petrol at Jedda sufficient for both journeys, which is cheaper as well as more convenient. Another reason is said to be that a deficiency had occurred in the tax which the Municipal Board at Mecca levies on the sale of petrol there. This, however, cannot be vouched for, as it is known that the motor owners had oifered, but without success, to make up the board's deficit in this respect. 44. The following is a brief account of other complaints made in connexion with motor transport: — (1) Several reports were received of accidents and over-turning of motor vehicles, resulting in injuries and deaths. Among Indian pilgrims a certain proprietor of the ice factory at Lucknow and an Indian woman lost their lives; while many, including two deputy collectors, received serious injuries. Many of the injuries were the result of rash and incompetent driving on bad roads, not merely of unavoidable accidents. (2) Many of the pilgrims had their baggage dropped on the road from cars, and no effort was made, either by the drivers, motor owners or the authorities14 to search for it. It is not known which, if any, of these three can be held responsible for making good the loss. In previous years this question received much attention. To cite one example it may be stated that once when the Mamur-al-Koshan on the Mecca-Medina road, to whose notice the loss o± luggage was brought by a pilgrim, refused to take any action, he was fined tor not having compelled the driver concerned to return and search for the missing articles. (3) The permit which the pilgrims have to obtain before they are allowed to undertake any journey by any conveyance in the Hejaz is called a koshan. The koshan office at Mecca is situated on the outskirts of the city. I ilgrims seated in their cars, &amp;c., come and wait there till the permits are issued, they were again in 1930 loud in their complaints that they had to wait for hours and that money was often extorted from them before the permits were issued. Many of the present difficulties on this account would be obviated if the koshan permits for the return journey were obtainable from the revenue office, Mecca, some two or three days in advance. . • n i n n , • (4) Certain pilgrims complained that, despite their having paid the lull hire for a whole car, including Government koshan, in order that they should have the car to themselves as they had women with them, they were forced to admit other passengers. This was the result of the combined action of the mutawwifs and the motor owners, who saw in it a way of obtaining more money. Although, in some cases the Indian vice-consul managed to get the excess hire refunded, yet the individuals concerned did not get what they desired more comfort and freedom. (5) In certain cases the members of one family were divided between two cars—men in one and women in the other—which travelled at a considerable distance from each other. They had, therefore, to remain separated for hours, which in a foreign and an unknown land was a source of unnecessary anxiety. (6) There were again many complaints of the mutawwifs having failed to provide cars, both on the occasion of journeys from Mecca to Medina and vice versa, resulting in considerable delay and inconvenience. In one case a certain Abdul Wahab Kamaruddin collected motor hire from a party of about twenty-one pilgrims, but did not provide cars till a month after. This has been fully dealt with under head ' mutawwifs.' (7) The gain in brokerage for providing cars was so great that even supposedly pious people did not hesitate to avail themselves of this method of lining their pockets. At Mecca there is a certain spiritual teacher, Syed Habashi, a descendant of an old and a famous Mecca family. Malabaris and Cingalese form the greater part of his disciples. This spiritual guide in conspiracy with the notorious Syed Soraj VVali, the mutawwif for Malabaris, charged motor hire from his followers double that of the current market rate. This particular difficulty could be avoided if pilgrims from both those countries were warned not to trust any such persons in the Hejaz in money matters, but to ascertain the true rate of hire from the Indian pilgrimage office at Mecca or Jedda. (8) A certain well-to-do merchant of Bombay, who was coming from Medina with his family in a car, complained that his car was commandeered on the way by Nejdi soldiers and that for two hours, until his car was returned, he was lying ^ith his family and children on the road without shelter. General. 44 a . The question of obtaining a refund of return motor hire in respect of those pilgrims who died at Medina was taken up with the Hejazi Government in 1929. No final decision in the matter has yet been reached by them, and they appear to be prolonging the investigation unduly. As a matter of fact it is not the motor companies who stand to lose by this refund for only about £3 of the total motor hire of £9 or £10 goes to the motor owners, while the rest is consumed in Government koshan. The Hejazi Government in preceding years used to commandeer motor vehicles already set aside for the use of pilgrims, much to the inconvenience of the latter. This year the Minister of Finance, in order to safeguard pilgrims' interests and also perhaps to make money for himself, proposed to the motor owners that they should pay 5 piastres miri per passenger for a journey to Mecca and 3 riyals for a journey to Medina, the object of this collection being that the Government should start a motor company for its own use from the proceeds. The motor owners consented to pay tax, which they collected from the pilgrims,,and the company was started, and as a consequence fewer cars were commandeered this year. On or about the 22nd May a big fire broke out at Masajidn, a halting station on the Jedda-Medina road. About eight motor vehicles, which were halting there lor the night, were burnt. Happily there was no loss of life. An Indian driver was as a consequence, without any apparent fault of his, kept in gaol for some time. Camels. 45. Ihe number of pilgrims who travelled by camels was less than in previous years. This was due to the fact that strict instructions had been issued to the mutawwifs by their chief to discourage pilgrims, as far as possible, from using camels. Moreover, as the mutawwifs themselves stood to gain much by sending pilgrims in cars, they themselves did not wish to send their pilgrims by camels. They had resorted to camels in the beginning of the 1929 season only because the institution of the 'Naqaba' had altogether curtailed their brokerage on cars and they were anxious to bring that system to an end in whatever way they could. Camel hire for the journey from Jedda to Mecca and Medina remained the same as in 1929, while on the return journey from Mecca to Jedda it was nearly doubled. Although camels were not greatly used in transporting pilgrims they were nevertheless used for carrying pilgrims' luggage, which according to regulations in force cannot be taken in motor vehicles in which, only light kit is allowed. Mutawwifs were again instructed to load camels as lightly as possible so that a greater number of camels might be utilised, thereby bringing in more koshan money for the Government. In hundreds of cases koshan was paid for, say, ten camels, and the luggage was actually loaded on six as the camel men could not possibly load their camels lighter. The Javanese and the Malayans were the chief sufferers in this respect. The Indian pilgrims whenever they experienced any such difficulty at once brought it to the notice of the Indian vice-consul, who was at least able to obtain for the complainants as many camels as they had paid for. Regarding the journey to Medina, although there was no official prohibition against travelling by camel yet the mutawwifs were secretly instructed to discountenance this mode of transport. That this was so may be judged by the fact that once when certain Javanese mutawwifs, who had charged their pilgrims a lump sum for all their expenses during the pilgrimage, desired, for their own gain, to take their pilgrims on camels, this was objected to by the chief mutawwif. Eventually, although the pilgrims went by camel, the mutawwifs had to pay an extra sum to the Government for the difference between camel and car koshan. Indian pilgrims, however, did not experience any such difficulties. Their mutawwifs as they stood to gain a pound, or in some cases even two or three per head, as brokerage, persuaded them by every possible means to travel by cars. Consequently the number of Indian pilgrims who availed themselves of camel transport was small. Camels were available in plenty for the journey to Arafat. This was due to the fact that the Javanese and Malayans had left for Arafat some two or three days before the Haj day and the camels which had taken them had had time to return to Mecca. Moreover, there was no great demand for camels for the mutawwifs, who knew beforehand that camel hire to Arafat was going to be increased, and being afraid lest the pilgrims after paying camel hire, &amp;c., should have nothing left for them to obtain, advised them to go on foot. On the return journey from Mecca to Jedda camel hire was increased from Rs. 15/8 to Rs. 28. ' Of this increase the camel men got only Rs. 7, while the rest went to the Government in koshan. This was very hard on the pilgrims especially as it came at a time when their purses were already exhausted and the expenses at Jedda were still to be defrayed. Those who could not afford to pay this amount travelled on foot and the number of those who walked to Arafat was considerable. A rabias. 46. Arabias (a form of cab used between the outskirts of Mecca and the pilgrims' quarters). As motor cars during the rush season are not allowed to enter the city itself, arabias are used to cover the remaining distance. They are mainly used by old and infirm or else by respectable pil' i ims, especially by their women and children. The rate of hire is exorbitant, ranging from £1 to £2 during the rush period.I. A l 16 (6) Customs. 47. The Hejaz Government during the earlier part of the season found itself faced with a financial crisis, and in order to remedy matters had recourse to every possible means of raising money. The results of this were far-reaching and were felt in every department. Its effect on motor and camel transport has already been dealt with. Its effects on the customs regulations was equally pernicious. Pilgrims' luggage was subjected to the strictest of searches, which prolonged their unpleasant stay in the customs sheds by many hours, especially, as was often the case, when several pilgrim steamers arrived in port almost simultaneously. There were again many cases of theft of pilgrims belongings, which the customs subordinates of low class and meagrely paid as they are, were not averse to pilfering during the search. The Hejazi Government, fearing that the old customs officals, nearly all Hejazis, did not carry out their duties honestly and allowed merchandise to pass through free on the pretext that it was pilgrims' luggage, appointed a Nejdi official along with every Hejazi one. Unfortunately, however, the Nejdis proved far more greedy than their Hejazi companions and caused great vexation to the pilgrims exploiting them for their own selfish gain. The mutawwifs when they noticed that pilgrims were subjected to a greater strictness in this respect than before, collected a certain amount from each pilgrim with which to silence the customs officials. As explained in the report for 1929, it has been found by actual experience that pilgrims' difficulties in this respect were, to a greater extent, minimised when the Indian vice-consul or any member of the staff was present at the custom-house during the search. With the present staff of the Indian section, however, no really efficient super vision can be exercised. If and when, therefore, the suggestions put forward in connexion with paragraph 17 of the Haj Enquiry Committee's confidential report materialise, the pilgrims' present difficulty in this respect would, it is hoped, be minimised to a very appreciable extent if not eliminated altogether. 48. In the report for 1929 it was suggested that pilgrims should be advised not to bring uncut pieces of linen for shrouds, &amp;c., for use in the TIejaz, but to have them cut in short pieces in which case they are not subjected to customs dues. This suggestion is repeated in the present report. Another important question at issue in this connexion is that of unclaimed articles which are left or forgotten by Indian pilgrims in the custom-house at the time of their arrival and departure. At present the Hejaz Government take these into their possession and sell them by auction after the lapse of some time. It is suggested that if the necessary arrangements can be arrived at with the Hejazi authorities such articles should be delivered to the Legation in the same way as the effects of deceased Indian pilgrims. The subsequent sale of such articles would bring in a certain sum which could be utilised in the repatriation of destitutes, &amp;c. It appears that the Egyptian special police which come to manage the Egyptian pilgrimage, take possession of all such unclaimed articles in respect of Egyptian pilgrims, and there seems to be no reason why similar action should not eventually be taken in respect of the Indian pilgrimage. (7) Religious Interference. 49. No event worth recording was noticed. This was to a large extent due to the fact that mutawwifs were instructed by the authorities to avoid leading pilgrims to such places as might react unfavourably on their susceptibilities. Consequently the pilgrims mostly remained near the Haram. The religious courts, which are the bugbear of the native population, were instructed not to extend their jurisdiction over the pilgrims. Moreover, the Indian vice-consul and his staff advised all incoming pilgrims to refrain from smoking in the main thoroughfares, not to shave, and generally to comply with the existing regulations. The pilgrims, however, experienced unpleasant treatment at the hands of the committee called Amar-al-Maroof, certain pilgrims, especially Javanese, received severe beating for not complying with regulations. On the whole the committee was not so hard in its treatment of pilgrims as it was to local citizens. This committee, inasmuch as it costs about £40,000 annually, will, it is anticipated, be dissolved in view of the present financial stringency in the Hejaz; the local police being entrusted with the execution of its functions. This committee, it17 i&lt;r may be recalled, was formed only to satisfy certain fanatical tribal leaders, who have since lost most of their influence. If and when, therefore, the committee is dissolved the pilgrims will have greater freedom. In the Haram at Medina,, pilgrims had to put up with the same difficulties as usual; knowing full well that their attempts to kiss the grave of the Prophet would call down on them the bitter wrath of the Wahhabis, they nevertheless continued to kiss it heedless of the whips of the Nejdi soldiers. Many pilgrims, however, desirous of kissing the grave took advantage of the cupidity and avarice of the Nejdi soldiery, who are quite notorious in this respect, and managed to bribe them through their mutawwifs so that they looked the other way while the pilgrims embraced and kissed the grave to their heart's content. Similar bribes secured a certain amount of freedom for pilgrims who visited the other sacred places at Medina. As the result of the conclusion of a treaty of friendship between the Hejaz and Persia, pilgrims from the latter country had hoped to be allowed greater freedom in performing their religious rites. In this, however, they were greatly disappointed. They were even charged £1 per pilgrim, being the perquisite of the viceroy, for the journey to Medina in the place of the 105. taken from other pilgrims. 50. In this connexion it may be interesting to note that the tomb of c&lt; Our Mother Eve ' (Ummona Hawwa), which has hitherto been accessible to everybody and which had, as a matter of fact, been turned into a public graveyard, has been closed. It is stated that once the King, while sitting in his palace at Jedda, noticed multitudes of people coming in and going out of the tomb and reciting their prayers, &amp;c. It was too much for the King's orthodoxy, and a high wall was consequently ordered to be built at the entrance to hide the grave from public sight. (8) Mutawwifs. 51. The question of mutawwifs formed the subject of special sections in the pilgrimage reports for 1928 and 1929. The abuses enumerated in section (/), paragraphs 2 to 6, of the 1929 report continued in 1930; they were if anything more prevalent. It is not proposed to go into them in detail in this report. As the whole subject calls for consideration in the light of the Haj Enquiry Committee's reports and as the information on which these reports are based differs in many respects from that available in Jedda it seems preferable on the present occasion to deal with the matter more generally, beginning witn a description of the system at present in force. The following statement is based on information supplied and views held by the Indian vice-consul attached to the Legation. Munshi Ihsanullah's experience gives great weight to his opinions. 52. The business of guiding pilgrims is distributed in the Hejaz among three distinct classes of persons, viz., mutawwifs, whose proper function is to look after pilgrims during their stay in Mecca; muzawwars, who perform similar functions at Medina; and mutawwifs' agents or vakils at Jedda, who take charge of pilgrims on arrival there, arrange for their accommodation and onward iourney and resume charge when the pilgrims return from the Holy Cities. The emplovment by mutawwifs of one or other of these vakils to handle pilgrims in Jedda is legally compulsory. The vakils act under Government authority and are organised in three corporations, one for the agents of mutawwifs responsible for Dutch East Indians and Malayan pilgrims, one for those of mutawwits responsible for Indian pilgrims and one consisting of the remaining agents. 53. The mutawwifs proper acquire their rights by inheritance oi b\ obtaining the King's permission to practice the business, dthcr by after serving an apprenticeship as sabee to an existing mutawwif. They form two corporaions at Mecca, one for the Dutch East Indian and Malayan pilgrims the other for Indians and all others. The heads of eac h corporation i S known as sheikh-al-mntawwifin and is nominated by and . res P0 nslble )o the government The sheikh-al-mutawwifin of the pilgrim guides m charge of Indians, &amp;c., ha, Xta3I^y g be C di^ded into two classes, according as they have a right to take charge of all the pilgrims from a particular district under a system called taqrir, which was formerly general; or are employed by pil rims en] y ^ freedom of choice. Paragraph 12 of the Pilgrimage P . Tt*annlip&lt;i in list of districts in regard to which the taqrir system still operates. It applies [5725] D18 a slightly different form to pilgrims from West Africa, for whom the duties of mutawwif and vakil are performed by recognised sheikhs A proposal put forward early in 1930 to restore the taqnr system for all pilgrims was rejected by the Heiazi Government, at any rate for the time being, m spite of the temptation to increase revenue by farming out, as it were, the Moslem world and selling the mutawwifs' rights in respect of particular districts to the highest bidders. ^ 54. It is important to note, as the Haj Enquiry Commission was misinformed on the subject, that every pilgrim going to Mecca must have a mutawwif. The generality of pilgrims, however, still enjoy freedom of choice. This encourages the practice whereby mutawwifs take steps to recruit pilgrims in the country of origin, either by going there themselves or sending their sabees. In certain cases they work also in conjunction with Indian moulvis who, mostly in Bengal, collect pilgrims on their own account and turn them over at the port of embarkation to the mutawwif offering the best price for the right of handling them. The system whereby the mutawwifs recruit pilgrims in the country of origin also prevails in Malaya. Thus the majority of pilgrims of British origin are already, on arrival at Jedda, in the hands of a mutawwif or sabee and are sometimes accompanied as well by the moulvi. This gives the mutawwif, who has himself or by his employees collected the pilgrim, a considerable hold, but the hold does not become definite until after arrival in Jedda, where the pilgrim goes through the formality of su'al, i.e., he is asked to choose his mutawwif. Once he has done so he is finally committed, except in rare cases, in which it is some times possible to arrange for a change, if there has been a mistake or if gross misconduct can be proved against the mutawwif. If the pilgrim has no mutawwif in view, the sheikh-al-mutawwifin provides one, either by taking charge of the pilgrim himself or assigning him to another mutawwif. 55. Mutawwifs are as a class predatory and their proceedings both in India and the Hejaz give rise to much complaint. Munshi Ihsanullah fully endorses the trenchant criticisms in the Haj Commission's report of their activities in India. He cites extreme cases in which women have been persuaded to leave their homes, sell out and marry pilgrim guides to find themselves divorced after being stripped of everything; besides more ordinary abuses practised by them as touts in connexion with the booking of passages, inducing pilgrims to make superfluous purchases for the sake of the commission on them, &amp;c. 56. The Munshi deprecates the commission's proposals that the mutawwif in India should be licensed and that he should be brought within the regulations relative to pilgrim brokers. He fears that the possession of a licence might merely increase the mutawwif's capacity for evil and that the profession of pilgrim broker should be treated as entirely distinct and should be confined to British subjects. In this connexion attention must be drawn to a certain misconception as to the national status of mutawwifs. No person who is not a Hejazi subject can practise the profession in the Hejaz and although many of those concerned with India are of Bengali origin, they are resident in the Hejaz and travel apparently with Hejazi passports. His Majesty's Minister records these points for consideration, without feeling competent to form an independent opinion. It occurs to him that some of the mutawwifs of Bengali origin may possess dual nationality. This might account for the Haj Commission having spoken in paragraph 244 of the published report of a considerable proportion of them as being British Indian subjects, whereas in the Hejaz all are considered Hejazis. 57. Many of the abuses practised by the mutawwifs in the Hejaz may be put down to a weakening of the Government control which it was sought to enforce during the first years of Ibn Saud's regime. This weakening is partly attributed to the fact that the increasingly heavy Government taxes on pilgrims travelling in the Hejaz are included in the pilgrim charges which the mutawwifs and their vakils are allowed to levy. As the exigencies of the Government increase and the mutawwif's or vakil's margin of profit diminishes these middlemen are apt to be driven into evil courses, nor are the authorities always ready to repress misconduct on the part of agents who serve them so conveniently as tax-collectors. It is only fair to say in anticipation of the report on the 1931 pilgrimage that, in drawing up the schedule of authorised charges for 1931, the Government have attempted to remedy the situation by issuing to the mutawwif a fixed remuneration of 10 rupees per pilgrim in addition to anything else he may make.19 Up to 1930, however, there was a deterioration among the mutawwifs, who are for the most part impecunious, so impecunious that they have frequently to rely on their vakils in Jedda to finance them, e.g., for the purpose of their visits to India. Subject to the special cases noted below, there has not been the same deterioration among the vakils themselves, largely because they are amenable to a certain amount of Legation control and influence, the exertion of which is facilitated by the helpful attitude of the present Governor of Jedda. It will be seen from what precedes that the favourable view of the effect of the Hejazi Government's measures to control mutawwifs taken in paragraph 10 of the Haj Commission s confidential report is somewhat out of date. 58. The Indian vice-consul draws special attention to the harmful influence of the head sheikh of mutawwifs in Mecca, who stands high in the favour of the Government to the license enjoyed by his proteges among the rank and file of the mutawwifs; to the growing abuse of the agency system in Jedda, under which a single vakil may act for an excessive number of mutawwifs; and to the unfortunate consequences of the fact that the naqib or head of the mutawwifs' agents in Jedda, responsible for Indian pilgrims, is himself one of the largest agents. The agency evil is aggravated by the employment of sub-agents. Thus the clerk of the head sheikh of mutawwifs in Mecca, a man named Abdul Aziz, is by way of being an agent in Jedda. He does his work there through a sub-agent who received one third of the takings. This man is said to have held agencies giving him control of 2,400 pilgrims in 1930 and his wife holds other agencies inherited from her father. The head or naqib of the Indian mutawwifs' agents in Jedda, who also enjoys the protection of the head sheikh in Mecca, is stated to be a pluralist on an , even larger scale. This man, one Husein Abu Zaid, is apparently privileged to act as vakil both for mutawwifs responsible for Indian pilgrims and for those in the miscellaneous category. He is said to have held agencies in 1930 giving him control of 2,700 Indian and Afghan pilgrims, 6,500 Egyptians and 1,950 others. It is obvious that he cannot satisfactorily render the services required of him to so large a number of people. The congestion is bad enough when the pilgrims arrive in batches from overseas. It is infinitely worse when they troop back in masses to Jedda after the pilgrimage, eager to get home and requiring attention and accommodation before they can leave. The head agent in question knows no Indian language. He is entitled to receive 3 piastres for each pilgrim, but he can neither cope with his own work nor control other vakils, whom it should be his duty to supervise. It is most unfortunate that when in 1926 Ibn Sand approved of a proposal by the Indian vice-consul that there should be a separate sheikh of the mutawwifs' agents responsible for the Indian pilgrims, as there had previously been for the Javanese and Malays only, the choice made should have been so unhappy. ' 59. The Indian vice-consul is so impressed by the evils described above that he has suggested that His Majesty's Minister should take the matter up personally with Ibn Saud with a view to securing the following objects ; (1) The Indian pilgrims to be taken from the present naqib, Husein Abu Zaid, and distributed among other pilgrims. (2) The appointment of a person, not himself an agent and having a knowledge of Indian language, to be naqib of the agents responsible for the Indian pilgrims. (3) The number of agencies which may be held by any single vakil to be limited. (4) The right to appoint sub-agents to be abolished, so that the clerk ot the head sheikh at Mecca should have to choose between renouncing his agencies or coming to Jedda to look after them and some suitable arrangement to be made as regards the agencies held by his wife. 60. This proposal is under consideration at the time of writing, but it is doubtful whether the moment is propitious for broaching the matter with Ibn Saud, who is too jealous of his position in regard to pilgrims to welcome foreign and non-Moslem intervention. Some time ago the Legation too.c a step lorward on its own account by drawing up black lists of mutawwifs^ frequenting India and Malaya with a view to the refusal of travelling facilities to undesirables. This measure was adopted in consultation with the Governments of India ant the Straits Settlements, and, in the latter case, in conjunction with the Nether- r c'tokn D 2n 20 lands Legation It had made a certain impression but itmust be noted that it cannot be pushed too far lest it should be an incentive to the Hepzi Government to generalise the taqrir system and thus ^ k e it unnecessary for mutawwifs to go to the pilgrims' countries of origin to collect their cliente e. go to tne pi g account does not deal wlth the Medina muzawwars who are less important as the arrangements for the journey to Medina are made by the mutawwifs before the pilgrim starts, and the muzawwar s business consists onlyZ looking after pilgnms during their normally very short stay m return for' a small remuneration, usually 5 rupees, not fixed by regulation The Dutch East Indian and Malayan pilgrim are free to employ any recognised muzawwar, die choice usually being made by the mutawwif who has arranged the lourney o Medina. Indian and other pilgrims are assigned under a system of taqnr to particular muzawwars. (9) Indian Pilgrimage. 62 The first Indian pilgrim ship, steamship ' Alavi, arrived at Jed da on the 5th January, 1930, while the last, steamship Rahmam arrived on the 2nd Mav. The number of pilgrims who sailed from Indian ports this season was 16,697, as against 19,656 for 1929. r? -i • -p v&gt; ' f The following table shows the number of pilgrims from each province of India and also from Burma and Ceylon, classified according to ports of embarkation ;— B ritish Subjects.

This decrease was due to a diminution in the number of Bengali pilgrims, who were 3,708, as against 7,227 for 1929, the floods in Assam and the fall in the price of jute and other Indian products being the main causes of the decrease. Other provinces in India, despite political unrest, sent nearly the same number—some even more—than in 1929. The following list shows the number of foreign pilgrims who travelled via Indian ports;— Nationality. Chinese (Turkestan) Afghans South Africans Bahrainis Russian Turkestan Chinese Persians Miscellaneous countries Hejaz-Nejd, &amp;c. \«^&gt;21 The number of foreign pilgrims was less by 742 than in 1929. Of this ■decrease, Afghans were responsible for 331, while Persians showed a considerable decrease, their number being 1,010 as against 2,676 for 1929, this being due to the fact that many of them (1,650 in number) came via Iraq. Iraqi pilgrims also came to the Hejaz via Syria instead of India. The deficiency in the number of Persian pilgrims was, however, to some extent made up by pilgrims from Chinese Turkestan, who numbered 1,442 as against 73 in 1929. There were twelve pilgrims from Russian Turkestan as against six for the previous year. In addition to those who came from Indian ports, 150 Indian pilgrims came via Iraq. There were also seventeen Indians who came from Engand or other northern countries via Suez. One hundred and fifty-one Indians without means travelled overland via Hasa and Riadh and were eventually repatriated at Government expense. 63. It was hoped that as a result of the smaller number of pilgrims in 1930 no difficulty would be experienced in providing return passages. Unfortunately, however, much delay and inconvenience was caused by the fact that certain of the Mogul Line steamers, which had originally imported Indian pilgrims, subsequently became engaged in the transport of Egyptian pilgrims under contract with the Khedivial Line. According to this agreement, the Khedivial Line agents at Jedda attempted to obtain steamship 'Akbar' and steamship ' Dara' just at the time when the former was already fully booked and ready to sail for India, while 40 first-class, 18 second-class and 800 deck-class return ticket holders were waiting for steamship 'Dara' to sail. Steamship ' Akbar 1 left for India, but the Khedivial agents obtained the services of steamship 'Dara ' for carrying Egyptian pilgrims back to Egypt, with the result that the Indian pilgrims booked on that ship were detained. There was no other steamer of the Mogul Line in harbour and none was expected from Indian ports within the next twenty days. Great resentment was caused, and deputation after deputation of Indians visited the Legation to protest against this action. This incident, which caused much distress to Indian pilgrims, is one which should be guarded against in future. It is suggested that the best way of preventing its recurrence would be for legislation to be passed whereby companies engaged in the Indian pilgrim traffic would, under pain of severe fine, &amp;c., be forbidden to employ the steamers in which pilgrims were brought to the Hejaz in any other traffic, until all pilgrim'' who held the companies' return tickets and were awaiting shipment had been embarked for India. -if? With the exception of this incident, pilgrims were not detained ior any long periods. . i i at 64. Only two shipping companies, viz., the Mogul Line and the JNemazee Line, were concerned with the transport of pilgrims between India and the Hejaz during 1930. The following table shows the number carried each way by each ol these companies and the number of voyages made by their vessels — Brought in. # Repatriated. . Line. No. of Ships.

The remainder were probably Hejazis who returned to this country in pilgrim steamers and did not leave the country again after the Haj. 65.

Note. —After the sailing - of the Nemazee Line steamers their remaining pilgrims were carried by the Mogul Line steamers.23 ' ^ rom the statistics given above, it will be seen that no pilgrims were aetainea beyond the period allowed, viz., twenty-five days; consequently, no fines ■were imposed on the shipping companies. There were, however, some complaints against the shipping companies staff, Avhich are briefly summarised as follows :— (1) When steamship Shuja ' left this port for India on the 7th June, there were eleven first-class and fifteen second-class return ticket holders who could not get accommodation. There was no other ship of the same line available, and, as they could not wait, they had no alternative but to travel as deck passengers in steamship 'Shuja.' Deck passages were accordingly given to them on the clear under standing that they would receive the same facilities as those to which their original class of ticket would have entitled them and also that they would be accommodated on the upper deck. They agreed that they should receive no refund of the difterence between the cost of a, deck passage and their respective classes. Unfortunately, however, nothing was done to provide any sort of accommodation or facilities as promised. The matter being brought to the notice of the Indian vice-consul, he invited the attention of the chief officer to the matter, but the latter did nothing. The captain, who was subsequently approached was equally unhelpful. His attitude was, indeed, discourteous. Complaints were freely made on board, and two letters were received from prominent Indians to the effect that the officers had offered their cabins at prices ranging up to 400 rupees, and tihat the crew had reserved deck space, which they hired out to the pilgrims. The poop, for instance, was roped off, and it was said that 50 rupees were asked by the lascars for deck-space thereon. The first ufficer denied that this space was included in the survey certificate. (2) On steamship 'Rahmani '' a pilgrim reported that a sweeper on board had stolen his tin of ghee and also charged him 5 rupees for porterage. The matter, with the assistance of the master, was promptly investigated and the tin recovered. (3) A first-class pilgrim, named Mohammed Husain, complained that, on steamship 'Sarvistan,' a first-class cabin, No. 7, of two berths, was given to three pilgrims; a bench being used to accommodate the third man, to the great inconvenience of all three. (4) The effects of pilgrims dying on board were handed over to persons other than the next of kin, whose name is given in the passport. A case of this nature was discovered on steamship 'Sarvistan.' Steps were accordingly taken to recover the effects from the illegal recipients on their landing, and they were forwarded to the Commissioner of Police, Bombay, for disposal. (5) There were many complaints of a minor nature regarding distribution of water, light between deck, and latrines, &amp;c. These questions have already been taken up by the Haj Enquiry Committee. Moreover, Mr. Bond, in his report of the pilgrimage of 1929, fully discussed further necessary improvements in this connexion. (6) There were two cases of persons being lost overboard during the journey, the first incidents of their kind for the last ten years. The first case was that of a child on board steamship ' Arabistan.' The second case happened on steamship ' Akbar.' The pilgrim was an indoor patient of the ship's hospital when the loss occurred. A certain responsibility would, therefore, appear to attach to the ship's staff in this case. 70. Complaints of the nature described above, or else connected with the shipping affairs in general, were fully discussed by Mr. Bond in his annual report on the pilgrimage of 1929. Inasmuch as the suggestions of the Haj Enquiry Committee are now under consideration, it would be opportune if the Govern ment of India be moved to consider simultaneously the suggestions made by Mr. Bond in paragraphs 29 and 30 of his report. 71. While there were comparatively few difficulties in respect of ships and shipping experienced by pilgrims who came to the Hejaz direct from India, many complaints were received from pilgrims who came to the Hejaz via Iraq. These complaints were directed to a general extent against the Mesopotamia and■11. ilW IW Hi—' Mir —r 24 Persian Transport Company, and were due to the fac t ^ at P^/ndia by 0 ^ Bagdad, had purchased return tickets direct from Je m ' discovered in Jedda that they had been charged difierent ^ by 11 6 ° ^J e Thus, while the charge for a deck passage was mall y charged as much as 135 rupees; pilgrims travelling by f c ° nc '^ 1 n ass between 155 rupees and 315 rupees. Those who had ^ ^ |® , e ?® endeavoured to recover the excess from the Jedda agents ot the ( ompany, but in _ most cases without success, though in a few cases on the Legation, the agents did refund the money. Many of those who could not obtain a refund, did not utilise their return tickets, but bought new ones from other companies, with the object of applying for a refund from the Mesopotamia and Persian Transport Company on their return to India. The same companj moreover, instructed the Jedda agents not to accept certain tickets issued at Bagdad, which appeared to be quite in order. The pilgrims holding these ic ets, although they were Afghans and not British protected persons, caused consider able trouble at the Legation on the ground that the firm responsible for their troubles was a British concern. All this occasioned great inconvenience both to pilgrims and to the Legation. The question has, however, already been dealt with, and it is hoped that complaints on this score will not recur. Registration. 72. The total number of pilgrims who registered their tickets this year was 10,490. Some pilgrims, for one reason or another, did not deposit their tickets, with the result that many of them lost them. As has been suggested, under the heading of ' Destitutes,' some sort of preferential treatment accorded to those pilgrims who register their tickets might prove an effective incentive for all pilgrims to register their tickets. Besides preventing the loss of tickets among pilgrims, one of the advantages of the system of registration is that seventy -nine return tickets, worth about 5,000 rupees, to which no claimants had come forward, were sent to the Government of India at the end of the season in 1929, and in 1930 108 such tickets were sent. But for this system these tickets would have fallen into the hands of impostors, and would have been utilised by them or sold. Local Haj Committee. 73. Again, in 1930, with the concurrence of the Hejaz authorities, a committee was appointed, under the presidency of the Indian vice-consul, to draw up lists of returning pilgrims and to allot them steamer accommodation in the order of their arrival at Jedda after the pilgrimage. This year, even notorious agitators like Ismail Ghaznavi, a declared enemy of the committee, recognised the value of the system and caused his passage to be booked according to the regulations, like other pilgrims. The president of the official Hejazi Committee again acted as vice-president. The shipping companies were represented on the committee, and the Hejaz Government deputed the head of the local mutawwifs' agents to be a member. A representative of the Persian Legation also attended. No Turkish representative was deputed to look after the Afghans' interest. 74. Mr. Bond in the 1929 report discussed this question fully. It is absolutely necessary that the recommendations made by him in paragraphs 11 to 18 should be given practical shape. In addition to the suggestion already made the following few points are submitted for the favourable consideration of the Government of India :— j (1) The local shipping agents should notify the Indian pilgrimage officer of the date of the sailing of the ships on the return journey, and once this has been done they should not be allowed to alter the date, except in exceptional circumstances, as was done in 1930 in the case of steamship ' Dara.' (2) It is suggested that masters of pilgrim steamers be asked not to sail until the Legation is satisfied that pilgrims are properly embarked and have no complaints, &amp;c., to make before they leave Jedda. This could, perhaps, be best effected by prohibiting the steamer from sailing until the bill of health has been end'orsed by His Majesty's Minister or his representative. (3) Masters of ships be requested to supply the Legation with a copy of the25 medical diary on the arrival of the steamer, as recommended by the Haj Enquiry Committee in paragraph 253, rule 115. (4)—ifl) T he Haj Committee in paragraph 252 of their report suggested that death certificates be forwarded to the Commissioner of Police at Bombay in respect of those pilgrims who die in the Hejaz. It is preferable that this should be limited to cases where application for a certificate is made, otherwise heavy clerical labour would be entailed. Moreover, the effects of many pilgrims, who are often accompanied by their next-of-kin, are taken over by the latter and therefore do not figure in the lists of the deceased. (h) In this connexion, attention may be directed to the fact that it is the present practice of the Sharia Courts at Mecca, in cases where pilgrims appoint as executors persons other than the next-of-kin mentioned in their passports, to hand over the effects to these persons. This practice should be discouraged. In the past in Jedda the local Bait-al-Mal used to get such statement verified by the Indian vice-consul. The practice is worth renewing, and some sort of similar arrangements are needed at Mecca too. (c) On the pilgrim passes a notice could, perhaps, be printed in the language of the province in which the pass is issued that no pilgrim should appoint in the Hejaz persons other than his next-of-kin to receive his effects in the event of his death. Destitutes. 75. The total number of destitutes repatriated in 1930 at Government expense was 387 as against 139 in 1929. Of this 251 came overland, 134 were single ticket holders who had made declarations to the effect that they were not returning to India immediately or else had travelled in the off season; two of them were return ticket holders who had come on pilgrimage some six years ago and had already taken refunds on their tickets. The following table will show the proportion of the destitutes according to their provinces of origin ;— Sind ... ... ... ... 153 Punjab ... ... ... ... 61 Bengal ... ... ... ... 50 Baluchistan ... ... ... ... 43 Madras ... ... ... ... 33 N.W.F.P. ... ... ... ... 22 United Provinces ... ... ... 16 Central Agency ... ... ... 2 Bihar and Orissa ... ... ... 1 Ceylon ... ... ... ... 1 Delhi ... ... ... ... 1 387 The total cost of repatriation, including food and sambuk charges, &amp;c., was 14,804-11 rupees. Of this amount the Government of India paid 13,795-11 rupees, while the balance was met from the collection made from such pilgrims as were found to have any money at all. All the destitutes, as^ in preceding years, w T ere shipped by Mogul line steamers at 35 rupees each. Ihis rate compares unfavourably with that of 15 rupees in 1927, 13-8 rupees in 1928 and 25 rupees in 1929. Nevertheless, Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co.. complained that the number of destitutes booked at the concession rate was excessive; that the passages were obtained by fraud by rich pilgrims, and that insufficient care was exercised by this Legation in granting destitute tickets. This complaint seems unjustified in view of the fact that even with destitutes on board the steamers in question were not fully loaded, and the extra money paid in respect of destitutes can therefore hardly have been unwelcome to the company. Moreover, this rate was available to everyone by later steamers. 76. Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co. derive considerable profit from the pilgrimage every year, and it might be reasonably expected from them to carry a certain proportion of destitutes at specially redhiced rates. King Hussein, when in the Hejaz, attempted to make a law that shipping companies should carry [5725] E26 10 per cent, of pilgrims without charge on each returning steamer. Ihis demand was, however, successfully resisted, but nevertheless it seems reasonable to expect that the company should carry destitutes at a special rate when necessity arises. In this connexion it may be mentioned that the company granted 200 passages to the Hejaz Government at 20 rupees each for destitutes whom the Government wished to repatriate; it seems, therefore, illogical for the company to complain that they were asked to repatriate British Indians at the rate of 35 rupees per head. The local paper, the ' Umm-al-Qura,' incidentally published an article about these destitutes whom the Hejaz Government repatriated, stating that King Ibn Saud in his munificence had come to the aid of Indians, Bokharis and Afgnans. The whole matter has, however, been dealt with in detail in a separate despatch to the Government of India, and need not be discussed here. 77. The question of repatriation of destitutes is a problem with whicH the Government of India and this Legation are confronted every year, and it is most necessary and desirable that some solution should be found whereby this increasingly difficult and ever recurring nuisance shall be stopped. As already pointed out on many previous occasions, the accumulation of such persons in Jedda for any length of time is troublesome, insanitary and damaging to British prestige. When this Legation is besieged by hundreds of destitutes clamouring to be repatriated to India, the question is not to consider the ways and means by which they came to the Hejaz, but to ship them out of the country as soon as circumstances permit. If this is not done the Hejaz Government may well call upon the Legation to remove this nuisance from the town as they did in 1928. This would be humiliating in the extreme and cause not a little talk in the bazaars, where it would be stated that the Government of India were unable to look after their pilgrims. 78. As may be observed from the figures given above, the main factors responsible for this abnormal increase in the number of destitutes were {a) the great number of single ticket holders who had either made a declaration or had travelled in the off season, and (h) the number of those who had travelled overland through Nejdor by dhow from Aden, Muscat or Hadramaut. (a) Ihe 1930 pilgrimage has shown only too clearly how inadequate and ridiculously obsolete are the regulations governing the grant of single tickets. Out of the total of 387 destitutes, 154 took advantage of the declaration system or else travelled in the non-pilgrim season on single tickets, permissible under rules, and were thus able to come on Haj with insufficient money to meet the minimum expenses incurred thereby. Karachi is a favourite port for this purpose. There are reasons to believe that certain pilgrim brokers in India inform their pros pective pilgrims that they can travel cheaply by going to Karachi and making the declaration there and will eventually be repatriated at Government expense. If an illustration of the point be needed, it may be added that from Karachi alone no less than thirty-eight pilgrims, evidently indigent, arrived in Jedda on single tickets tor the 1931 pilgrimage some four months before the Haj. Of these, a party of eight indigent Bengali pilgrims, who arrived here from Karachi by the steamship Alavi on the 4th November last with single tickets, applied to this Legation tor monetary assistance to enable them to proceed to Mecca. This party seem to have deliberately crone a long way out of their more direct route—Bombay m order to purchase single tickets. Moreover, it is a time-honoured custom among rich Mahometans in India to give alms to their poorer brethren who state that they are going to visit the Holy Land. Such alms generally take the form o a single fare to Jedda, which is permitted by the present regulations, or funds su icien or ivmg expenses while in the Hejaz. For the return journey such pilgrims expect, or indeed come with the assurance that thev will be repatriated at Government expense. ' v 79. It is not possible to produce nor should it be necessary to produce more cogent arguments against both these pernicious practices. It would appear that nothing short of their total abolition and the rigid enforcement of return ticket remedy^Ms^vil paS:Sp0rt s y stem — the latt er being preferable—will adequately t]ie ° V( u rlan( ? ro ^ te &gt; which this year was responsible for Tf i f a v. S11 , f S ' mi ^ c 1 ^ as a l re ady been said on many previous occasions, n P fh^l ' ? 0W T r ' that v Wlth /. r eturn to more settled conditions in the interior thls countl, y the number of indigent pilgrims taking to that route, if not27 proper y con ro ed, is bound Lo increase far beyond its present proportions; the increase as, m tact, already begun, and is all the more likely to develop in future, m view of rapid and cheap means of transport to the Hejaz obtainable as a resu 0 e opening oi the Hasa route to pilgrim traffic, which the Heiaz Govern- men contemplate doing m the near future. It is therefore high time for the (jrovernment oi India to adopt such measures as they deem fit and practicable with a view to preventing the improvident class of pilgrims from leaving India for the Hejaz by this route. 81. Apart fiom and in addition to the above main factors there are many other petty causes leading to eventual destitution, which, though responsible for only a small number, nevertheless, deserve some consideration. They are brieflv summarised as follows — j j (1) According to the regulations in force, the holders of a return ticket or deposit-paid passport are entitled to a refund of their return passage money after the expiry of one year after the date of issue. Many such persons who decide to prolong their stay in the Hejaz for more than one year apply for refund later. Although the Legation has dis couraged this practice as far as possible, it cannot be legally refused. After having obtained the refund the pilgrims, who are more often than not of poor or moderate means, declare themselves destitutes and have eventually to be repatriated. It is suggested that the period ol one year, during which, under present regulations, a refund on the return ticket or the deposit-paid passport may be claimed, should be extended to three years. Or, to ensure a greater success, to leave the question to the discretion of the Legation, which may be authorised to refuse or allow refunds as is considered lit, judging by the financial status of the individual concerned. (2) Another pernicious practice which is gaining strength, especially among Bengali pilgrims, is that the local pilgrim brokers while in India prevail on some of their clients to declare themselves as residents of Mecca. Accordingly the passports in respect of such pilgrims are stamped '' Foreign.' The officials of the Pilgrim Department in India responsible for issuing such passes apparently deal with them without caring to ascertain the exact nationality of the recipient, which must be clearly discernible from the very appearance of the pilgrims, and without realising the grave consequences attaching to this negligence on their part. On reaching here, these pilgrims, by virtue of their being declared ' Foreign,' apply for refund, which cannot be legally refused. Recently, a case occurred in which the applicants, five in number, applied for refunds on their respective return tickets before the expiration of one year. As they were all known definitely to the Legation to be British subjects, the refunds were refused. They next approached the Hejaz Government, who sent the passes to the Legation officially with a request that the refund should be paid on the grounds that the individuals concerned were Hejazi subjects. As the relative entry in the pilgrim passes confirmed this contention the refunds were paid, as it was considered safer and better to allow the refund at the time rather than raise the question of nationality. In the circum stances the Government of India would be well advised if instructions were issued to the effect that the 'Foreign' stamp should only be endorsed on Hejazi passports proper and not on pilgrim passes. (3) Loss of Return Tickets. —As the deposit of return tickets or deposit-paid passports at the Legation is not compulsory, many persons do not register their tickets here. There are consequently many cases every year of tickets having been lost. If the holders notify the Legation of the loss in time, steps are immediately taken to ensure against the same being used by impostors. If, on the contrary, the news of the loss reaches the Legation too late after the coupon, having fallen into an impostor's hands, has already been utilised, the individual concerned, often unable to purchase another return ticket, has to be repatriated at Government expense. The only remedy for this would seem to be that the advantages of registration should be brought home to all intending pilgrims as extensively and elaborately as possible. [5725] e 228 It would be as well if some sort of preferential tieatment could be accorded to those who register their tickets wuh this Legation, thev may be given return passages before those who do not register. This would, it is thought, prove a simple and elective means of persuading all pilgrims to register their tickets. 82, These observations are submitted to the consideration of the Govern, ment of India after a deep study of the whole problem, and would, it is considered, if given effect to, go far towards minimising the question of destitution. Pilgrim Passes. 83. As has been suggested under the heading of ' Destitutes,' the practice of issuing pilgrim passes stamped ' Foreign or showing the Mecca address should be discontinued. Great inconvenience is caused to pilgrims by the local system whereby the pilgrim passes are collected by the mutawwif s agents at the quay. In more than one case the passports were lost. Mr. Badi-uz-Zaman, MX.A., also lost his passport, which could not be found until he had left for Mecca, where the passport was sent to him later. He and other notable pilgrims bitterly criticised the system. The agents, it seems, want to retain the passes as security for the payment of their dues. Javanese pilgrims are not subjected to this regulation. Commissariat on Board Ship. 84. The pilgrims, especially those who had purchased tickets covering food on the journey, complained that the food supplied was far from satisfactory. : The Indian vice-consul discussed the matter with a relative of Messrs. Omer Bhai Chand Bhai, the food supply company, who came on Haj; the latter promised to take action against the employees responsible for this bad arrange ment. He, moreover, assured the Indian vice-consul that there would be no further cause for complaint on this account on the return journey. The tariff of food charges was hung in a conspicuous place in the office of the local Haj Committee for the general information of the pilgrims. Forged Indian Currency Notes. 85. Considerable perturbation was caused among pilgrims in 1930 by the fact that early in the season it was discovered that a considerable number of 100-rupee and 10-rupee Indian currency notes in the market were forged. Money changers became chary of accepting notes of these denominations, and a mild panic prevailed. The matter was brought to the notice of the Government of India telegraphically by the Legation with the request that all intending pilgrims should be warned not to bring Indian currency notes with them. Nevertheless, pilgrims continued bringing the notes and, as was anticipated, found themselves in great difficulties on their arrival here. Many notable pilgrims were stranded at Jedda on their way to Medina as the motor companies did not accept the notes. Luckily, the Legation held in cash the proceeds of the sale of certain deceased pilgrims' effects, and it was found possible, in cases of great distress, to change a certain number of Indian currency notes. Furthermore, an appeal was made to the leading Indian merchants at Mecca, who accepted a good number of notes. Messrs. Abdul Qadir Bhai of Bombay, who had come on Haj and have extensive commercial relations with the Hejazi merchants, contributed greatly towards, easing the situation. The manager of the Netherlands Trading Society, moreover, was approached by His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires on the matter and, after consultation with his head office, agreed to accept the notes. Thus a crisis was happily averted. That the matter had, in fact, assumed serious dimensions may well be judged by the fact that His Royal Highness the Emir Feisal personally approached His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires on the subject. Indian pilgrims would, in future, be well advised to bring gold and silver whenever possible, instead of currency notes, to avoid the possibility of any similar troubles. Publicity. 86. The North-Western Railway has published a pamphlet for the guidance of the Indian pilgrim. Unfortunately, however, no mention has been mades %l OOllOlj 5Cti? e J iikti lie Ui I notaie|' intbi ts COTtiii;:; m satiii f M« Baj;t lis W si Qev, I i in 11! , lew )ii]idrt 5 were ^ mM ess, to ^ rreatrl hkii 29 regarding the existence of the British Legation at Jedda or about the Indian pilgrimage offices at Jedda or Mecca. It is therefore recommended that the Government be moved to instruct the North-Western Railway s publicity committee to add the following information for the pilgrims' guidance in their next issue of the pamphlet:— (1) As soon as the ships bearing Indian pilgrims anchor at Jedda the Indian vice-consul together with his staff visit the ship. Any information about customs, dhow hire, coolie charges and other formalities to be _ gone through by the pilgrims at Jedda may be ascertained from him. (2) Pilgrims, after their debarkation, should visit the British Legation and deposit their return tickets or deposit-paid passports there for safe custody, (3) An Indian dispensary is attached to the British Legation, where pilgrims are treated free. Also during the pilgrim season medical facilities for Indian pilgrims are provided at Mecca in the Harat-al-Bab. (4) The Indian vice-consul is stationed in the same building as the dispensary during the Haj days. Moreover, in the off season as well he frequently visits Mecca. Any complaints against mutawwifs, &amp;c., may be reported to him and he will take any necessary action. (5) If the pilgrims from Mecca on their way to Medina are delayed at Jedda, the matter should be reported to the Indian vice-consul at once, who is always prepared to afford them all possible help. (6) On their way back to their homes, pilgrims usually visit the British Legation in connexion with their steamer passages. They should also note, however, if they happen to lose any of their kit in the sambuk or elsewhere during their way from the quay to the ship, they should report the matter to the Indian vice-consul, who generally visits each ship before sailing. (7) In short, the Indian pilgrims can approach the Indian vice-consul in connexion with any matter or difficulty they may contend or experience during their stay in the Hejaz. Staff. 87. Mr. Syed Nur Hussein Shah, who was seconded for duty at this post two years ago, has worked with commendable zeal and ability, not only in the pilgrimage work, but in routine matters connected with the Indian section. The correspondence of the Indian section has greatty increased, and it is due in great part to Syed Nur Hussein's untiring aid that the work of the section has been carried on so efficiently. Mr. Shah Johan Kabir, the Bengali clerk, has rendered valuable services in connexion with Bengali pilgrims. In the season proper he has been much occupied with the registration of all Indian pilgrims, and between seasons he has dealt conscientiously and ably with the intricacies of the estates of deceased pilgrims as also with the questions of registration connected therewith. Pilgrimage Tariff. 88. The cost of the pilgrimage remained the same as last year with a slight increase in mutawwif's fee. The schedule of charges issued by the Hejazi Government for the 1931 pilgrimage season is attached. Roughly, the cost of pilgimage, including steamer tickets and fares to Medina and back, may be taken at 1,000 rupees per pilgrim travelling by deck class.

The total number of Afghan pilgrims was 1,218 as against 1,162 for 1929. Of this total, 1,026 embarked at Karachi and forty-one at Bombay, whil© 151 came from Suez.31 90. Never, perhaps, in the history of the Afghan pilgrimage have so many q notables come iiom that country as in 1930. There were four ex-generals of the Afghan army and one consul-general. The meeting of both the anti- as well as pro-JNadir ohah elements here was a notable feature. The pro-Amanullah party were loud m their praise for the ex-King. This Legation again helped the ii Afghan pilgrims m various ways, such as issuing emergency passes to those who had lost their return tickets,^ &amp;c. The troubles of a party of seven Afghan I pilgrims who had travelled via Suez and possessed return tickets from Jedda to India issued by the Mesopotamia Persian Transport Company has already been dealt with under the heading ' Transport.' 91 - The Turkish representative this year took no interest in the affairs of Afghan pilgiims. He deputed no one to assist on his behalf on the local Hai Committee, on the grounds that he was no more the official representative of the Afghan Government. J 92 There were sixty-nine Afghan destitutes who were repatriated by the Hejaz Government. Malay Pilgrimage. 93. _ The season under review began with the sailing of the Blue Funnel steamship ' Titan ' from Singapore on the 13th November, 1929. The total number of ships carrying pilgrims from ports in the Straits Settlements to the Hejaz was twelve, all of which were of the Blue Funnel Line. The last of these ships arrived in Jedda on the Ist April, 1930. Number of Pilgrims ex Singapore and Penang. —The total number of pilgrims of the usual various nationalities was 6,333, including 267 babies. The figure for last season was 5,869. Number of Malay Pilgrims. —The number of registered Malay pilgrims from each colony or State in Malaya was as follows ;— Straits Settlements— Singapore Penang (including Province Wellesley and the Bindings) Malacca Labuan Federated Malay States— Perak Selangor Negri Sembilan Pahang Unfederated Malay States— J ohore Kedah Perlis Kelantan Tringganu Brunei 577 114 139 3 431 246 134 79 403 189 190 63 22 2,590 This figure shows an increase of 78 per cent, from that of last year, when the number was only 1,455; but it is yet far from normal for an ordinary pilgrimage 94. Pilgrims via India. —The number of Malay pilgrims who came via India was forty-six. Their general pecuniary condition whilst in the Hejaz was far irom satisfactory, as it cost them more to travel by this route than they expected. As their mutawwifs or sheikhs would only be tempted to sin in pecuniary matters against other pilgrims in order to be able to lend money to such ' hard-up ' ones (and those loans are seldom recovered), it would be to the interests of all if Pilgrims were tactfully discouraged to travel via India unless they possessed ample funds for the journey.32 Pilgrim Passes. 95 All issuing centres of pilgrim passes adopted the suggestion in my last autumn report m hfvmg the names of written in the Jawi (Arabic) characters as well as m English m order to enable Hejazi officials to identify them, except Singapore, Lenggong Rasa Bentong Alor Gajah and Muar. Vaccination and Inoculation. 96 The Government of the Straits Settlements foi the first tune in the history of the Malay pilgrimage passed and enforced the ruling that all pilgrims should be vaccinated and inoculated against small-pox and choleia respectively before embarking on pilgrim ships, though that for vaccination has been enforced for years. The advantages accruing to the pilgrims from such ruling cannot be over-estimated when one takes into consideration the prevalence of those terrible diseases among the pilgrims in the past. The Feeding System. 97. The much-discussed feeding of the pilgrims during their journey at sea to and fro was started this season. As in many other newly-introduced systems, it required improvement, though this was not with regard to the supply of food stuffs, but rather to the way in which the food was prepared. A memorandum on the subject was submitted by the Malay pilgrimage officer, and it was hoped, for the benefit of the shipping companies concerned as well as the reputation of all those responsible for bringing about this innovation, that the suggestion contained therein would be adopted. Conditions in Mecca. 98. Almost all the mutawwif's charges were the same as in previous years,, so that a repetition of the figures showing the various charges in the different items would be superfluous; it may be mentioned, however, that a pilgrim should have at least 600 dollars if he wishes to include a visit to Medina in his pilgrimage or 500 dollars without the Medina visit. On the other hand, it has to be recorded that the Hejazi Government taxes on travelling from place to place, known as 'koshan' and collected through the mutawwifs, were raised during the season, thereby causing some inconvenience to pilgrims, who naturally were not prepared for the extra charges. Examples of such increased taxes are :— {a) Koshan for travelling by car to Medina and back : Last year, £6; this year, £7. (6) Koshan for travelling by car, Mecca to Jedda : Before Haj, 3 riyals 4 pts.; after the Haj, 7 riyals. Conditions at Arafat and Muna. 99. Much better climatic and other conditions prevailed during the pilgrims' stay at Arafat and Muna, and the Hejaz Government was enabled to report that the number of deaths among pilgrims during these trying days of exposure was very much smaller than in many previous years. A slight flaw in the whole arrangement here occurred, however, and this was the commandeering by the Hejaz Government of several houses belonging to mutawwifs at Muna (where pilgrims stay three or four days for the performance of pilgrimage rites) for the use of their officials or their guests. This greatly inconvenienced some pilgrims, who would have been lodged in those houses and who consequently had to stay in tents instead. The Use of Cars for Journey to Arafat and Muna. 100. At the eleventh hour, on starting for Arafat and Muna, the Hejaz Government gave the ruling that pilgrims could use cars for going to these-33 places; and the result was not satisfactory. As the simultaneous use of cars and camels on the road could only result in great inconvenience to the riders of the latter, the best use for cars would appear to be to carry the sick and the infirm with their friends who looked after them, on a particular day, so that they would be able to spend the shortest possible time at Arafat and Muna. Assistance to Pilgrims. 101. The usual assistance to a number of pilgrims in recovering over payments and the like from their mutawwifs was rendered by the Malay pilgrimage officer, and the Malay destitute fund was of service to two pilgrims, the first being a case in which a pilgrim with a large family lost all his money on arrival in the country, the second being one in which the pilgrim was impoverished by the dishonesty of a pilgrim-broker in Singapore. Conditions during the Return Journey. 102. As usual, the Blue Funnel Line made such satisfactory arrangements for picking up pilgrims at Jedda after the Haj that not one of these pilgrims had to stay more than twenty days in Jedda before he could leave the place. One or two of the ship's doctors, however, did not readily recognise the difference between a merely infectious disease and a '' quarantine '' disease when deciding whether to accept or to reject a pilgrim on board a pilgrim ship. Another point worth recording was the occurrence of an incident which very nearly ended in causing grave dissatisfaction to, and probably trouble among, over a hundred odd pilgrims on board steamship ' Troilus.' It is reasonable to expect that everyone would be wise after a mishap; yet, a reminder might usefully be sent to the shipping company concerned to the effect that a recurrence of such inefficiency on the part of their responsible agents, resulting in applications to the British Legation at Jedda for excess certificates to cover very large numbers of extra passengers over and above the licensed number, would be held to their discredit. Return Portions of Non-returning Pilgrims^ Tickets. 103. The system whereby the validity of the return portions of non-returning pilgrims' tickets is extended for a further period of three years has proved not quite satisfactory, as pilgrims who have remained in the Hejaz beyond this period of extension, as well as those who intend for the moment to remain in the country for ever, fail to see any reason why they should not obtain refunds on the unused portions of their return tickets, the more so as they had been wheedled into buying return tickets when coming to the Hejaz. A meeting was held on the 20th May, consisting of Mr. Bond, of the British Legation, Jedda, Mr. Van de Poll, the agent of the Blue Funnel Line at Jedda, and the Malay pilgrimage officer, to discuss this longstanding and much-vexed question of refunds on unused tickets, and the unanimous decision arrived at was that it would be to the best interests of both the pilgrims and the shipping company concerned if the law was amended to the effect that: {a) All the pilgrims are to be obliged to purchase return tickets, except only in the case of Hejazi subjects returning to the Hejaz; (h) any pilgrims after two pilgrimage seasons fiom the date of issue of his ticket shall obtain the refund on the unused portion of his ticket on production of a certificate from the Legation at Jedda to the effect that he is still in the country. It was further pointed out at the meeting that such a system the fear of having to repatriate stranded Malay pilgiims in the Hejaz (the reason given for adopting the system of extending the validity oi those pilgrims' tickets) was unfounded, and this opinion was backed up by yeais of experience with Javanese pilgrims who have that system of refunds and w o are of the mentality as the Malayans. [5725] FDeceased Pilgrims and their Effects. 104. The total number of deceased pilgrims among those who came to the Hai this season, as reported to the Malay pilgrimage onicer up to the time he left Jedda on the 14th June, 1930, was 189, made up as follows : Straits Settlements— Singapore Penang (including Province Wellesley and the Bindings) Malacca Federated Malay States— Perak ... Selangor Negri Semblan Pehang Unfederated Malay States— Johore Kedah Kelantan Trengganu Brunic 189 The effects of those deceased pilgrims who had accompanying relatives in the Hejaz at the time of the death were handed over to the said relatives by the Hejazi Beit-al-Mal, but the effects of those who had no accompanying relatives or friends were retained by the Beit-al-Mal, and should reach the Malay pilgrimage officer through the usual channel some time during the 1930-31 season. These effects would then be distributed among the respective next of kin of the deceased pilgrims by the Malay pilgrimage officer on his return to Malaya through the usual channels. 21 8 9 32 23 22 16 23 9 17 3 6 Sundry Occurrences during the Season. 105. The general peace and safety to life and property in the Hejaz, the boast of Ibn Sand's Government, was maintained throughout the season, but quite a number of petty thefts occurred particularly at Arafat, so much so that one fears these thefts may soon become widespread. The recurrence of the case of swindling the pilgrims of their money for the purchase of tickets by pilgrim- brokers in the Straits Settlements ports compels one to advocate again the necessity for demanding bigger securities, either in cash or in responsible securities, from these pilgrim-brokers so as to safeguard the poor pilgrims. Staff. 106. Haji Abdul Majid, of the Federated Malay States Education Depart ment, acted as Malay pilgrimage officer for the sixth pilgrimage year, with Haji Mohammed Jamil, engaged temporarily for the season only, as his assistant. The need for a permanently-appointed Malay pilgrimage officer, advisedly styled as British (Malay) vice-consul, with a permanently-appointed clerk for the work, is again urged. West A frican Pilgrimage. 107. The official statistics published by the Jedda quarantine authorities show the number of West Africans and Nigerians who performed the pilgrimage in 1930 to have been 3,525, an increase of 1,187 on the 1929 figures. The official figure of 3,525 must again inevitably fall far short of the total number of West Africans who visited the Hejaz. There is reason to believe that more than half as many again travelled by sambuk from Massowah and landed at the Hejazi ports of Lith, Qunfida, Birka and Gahm, though, as usual, it has been found impossible to obtain accurate statistics in respect of pilgrims who land at ports other than Jedda.f 35 108.

Iraqi Pilgrimage. 111. The Hejaz quarantine authorities report that 278 Iraqi pilgrims arrived in Jedda in 1930, a decrease of 208 on the 1929 figures. Ten Iraqis reached the Hejaz via Indian ports. ito I Ten Iraqi pilgrims were advanced sums ranging from £2 5^. to £3 15^ i Tr against the 100 rupees deposited by each of them in Bagdad to enable them to p return home; they experienced no difficulty in finding steamship accommodation y on the return journey. r Palestinian and Transjordanian Pilgrimages. 112. The number of Palestinian and Transjordanian pilgrims to whom pilgrim passes were issued is reported to have been 516 and 26 respectively. Actually, 514 Palestinians left for the Hejaz as two of those registered did not proceed. Advances were made to nineteen pilgrims, who declared they had insufficient means to meet the cost of their steamship fare and subsistence on the return journey. ,. It is reported that two Palestinian pilgrims died on the pilgrimage. 5 aTHIS DOCUMENT 18 THE PROPERTY O F HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT - 11 - ' / '&lt; ' I 04 } J ^ f EASTERN ( A rabia ). ^ , November 26, 1931.

IjS accordance with arrangements made with your Department, I have the honour to submit herewith a general report on the pilgrimage to the Holy Places of the Hejaz in 1931. I have compiled this report at home from the series of special reports drawn up by the various pilgrimage officers attached to His Majesty s Legation at Jedda, which Mr. Hope Gill, who had not himself been in Jedda during the pilgrimage season, thought it better to send home as they stood, with annotations only, in his despatch to your predecessor. No. 373, of the 29th September. Although I have confined myself in the main to editing the separate reports freely condensing them where necessary, I have included certain additions and comments suggested by my own study of pilgrimage matters during the past twelve months. 2. I have preserved, as far as possible the form of the Pilgrimage Report for 1930. I propose to consider in due course the best means of standardising to some extent the form of these annual reports which, though always full of useful matter in the past, have not perhaps been drawn up in the most convenient manner for comparison from year to year. 3. In his above-mentioned despatch, His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires paid well-merited tributes to the work done in 1931 by the various pilgrimage officers and by Dr. Abdul Hamid, the head of the medical section. In endorsing these tributes, I need add nothing to what has on this and previous occasions been said of the constant devotion to the interests of Indian pilgrims shown by the British Indian vice-consul and Dr. Abdul Hamid, who sustain the heaviest burden. The Malay pilgrimage officer, Haji Abdul Mejid, brings to his task great knowledge of his countrymen and their special requirements and continues to render very valuable services. I would draw your special attention to the work of Captain B. W. Seager, who deals with the less highly organised sections of the pilgrimage and has to handle a great variety of pilgrims of different races, more especially those from British dependencies in Africa. I have been greatly impressed by the ability and sympathy with which he watches over the interests of pilgrims of this poorer and sometimes very helpless class. He was, moreover, of the greatest assistance to me in 1931 in discussing with the authorities concerned particular questions affecting African pilgrims and those from the Aden Protectorate, during the visits paid to Jedda in the spring by the Commissioner at Port Sudan and the Protectorate Secretary at Aden. 4. I would suggest that copies of the enclosed report should be circulated through the proper channels to India, Bagdad, Jerusalem and the usual other posts under the Colonial Office. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. r • 1 Enclosure in No. 1. Report on the Pilgrimage of 1931 (A.H. 1349). Prefatory Note. —Short explanations of a certain number of terms which occur frequently in connexion with the pilgrimage are given in Appendix A to the report. This list will be revised and amplified on a convenient future occasion. (1) Introductory and General. THE political situation in the Hejaz and Nejd underwent a marked deterioration during the first nine months of 1931. This did not manifest itself early enough to affect of itself the pilgrimage. The great decline in the number 6104 [6274] Bof overseas pilgrims was the result of depression in the countries of origin of conditions :n the Hejaz. Owing to its serious etlect on the hnances of the country, however, the decrease in the pilgrimage was itse t one o the principal causes of the deterioration in internal Hejazi conditions which became patent m the summer and autumn. It had become evident towards the end of 1930 that the number of overseas pilgrims in 1931 would tail fai shor o the number tot the previous season. As will presently be seen the event more than justified oioomy anticipations. The consequences to the finance and tiade of the Hejaz, a country with practically no resources other than those derived, directly or indirectly, from the pilgrimage, were disastrous. They extended far beyond the actual pilgrimage area owing to the large measure in which the other parts of Ibn Sand s dominions have become financially dependent on the ilejaz. i here is thus a close connexion between the pilgrimage and the general state of Hejaz-Nejd; so much so that immediately after the 1931 pilgrimage the means of improving pilgrimage conditions became one of the principal preoccupations of Ibn Saud and his advisers. When, in the course of his efforts to cope ^ ith the general situationj he decided, in June 1931, to convene a JNational Conference of representatives of the Hejazi towns, pilgrimage questions formed an important part of the agenda. The conference, however, produced few concrete results in any direction, and, up to the time of writing, little or nothing has been done to improve the basic conditions of the pilgrimage. 2. Pilgrimage Day, on which all pilgrims congregate at Arafat, fell this year on Tuesday, the 28th April. The usual uncertainty as to the exact date pre vailed up to the last moment, but, as there was no question of a Friday Haj (see paragraph 2 of the Report for 1930), the uncertainty was of little consequence, except as a cause of local inconvenience. 3. The climatic conditions were again favourable, a feature which may be expected to recur for many years to come now that the lunar dates of Pilgrimage Day and the ensuing festival are working back towards spring and winter. Thanks to this and the small dimensions of the 1931 pilgrimage, health conditions were unusually good. There was no epidemic disease and the mortality from ordinary causes (see section (4) below) w T as small. 4. ' It cannot be said that there was any marked improvement in 1931 in the sanitary equipment provided by the Hejazi Government. This subject will be dealt with more fully in section (4) below. 5. The total number of overseas pilgrims was less than half that for 1930, the number arriving by sea being estimated at 39,346, as compared with 84,821 in the previous year. Every important element showed a heavy decrease, as will be seen by the detailed statistics in section (2) below. 6. The number of inland pilgrims from the Hejaz itself and other parts of Arabia was also much less than in 1930. Even the residents of Mecca, who normally perform the Haj in great numbers, abstained to a large extent this year owing to financial stringency. The numbers from Nejd were also small. On the other hand, an unusually large number of pilgrims totalling several thousands came overland from the Yemen. Reckoning these various elements together with the pilgrims from overseas, the number of those assembled at Arafat on Pilgrimage Day may be put approximately at something in the neighbourhood of 50,000 persons. 7. The average means and purchasing pow T er of the foreign pilgrims was less than in previous years, even in the case of those, e.g., from the Dutch East Indies, who normally constitute the wealthier elements. This must be attributed to economic depression in the countries of origin. The general purchasing power of pilgrims was still further diminished by increases in Government charges and other necessary expenditure, so that the margin left for extras including the souvenirs, &amp;c., which pilgrims like to take home from the Holy Land, was greatly reduced. The Hejazi market, already depressed during the previous season (see paragraph 4 of the Report for 1930) was again overstocked and the local merchants suffered severely from trade depression, a fact which tended to aggravate the effect on the financial resources of the Government produced by the diminution in revenue derived direct from pilgrims. 8. The financial crisis which was foreshadowed in the latter part of 1930 and became acute in the spring of 1931 reacted on pilgrims in various ways. It brought in its train a monetary crisis, manifested in a heavy depreciation of the local silver and nickel currency. The silver rival, legally fixed at the rate of 10 topS the English gold pound, which is the basis of the currency system, broke away, and nickel ' haialas,' much used in retail transactions, 'suffered a serious devaluation accompanied by violent exchange fluctuations just about the time of ^1| the pilgrimage. The shifting policy of the Government in their efforts to cope with the situation, the manoeuvres of money-changers and other speculators, and ^ the lack of confidence among merchants all contributed to the prevalence of e ^ I: uncertain conditions with the result that the prices charged to pilgrims for the e |U| necessaries of life were apt to be inflated. According to the Indian vice-consul the inflation of prices was greater than was justified by fall in exchange and ^paiil imposed hardship on pilgrims as well as local inhabitants. The Malay pilgrimage ■ Ibis officer takes a more moderate view (cf. paragraph 172 below). Pilgrims also Hm suffered from the efforts of the Government to offset the diminution of revenue sof| : by a considerable increase in customs charges at the beginning of the year and as of I j j greater stringency in the surveillance of their luggage and personal effects. Inter itlllf. alia, a limit of 50 kilog. was set on the amount of rice allowed to be imported free kf® of duty for personal consumption, a departure from the previous practice of hie exempting all such rice from duty. Steps were also taken to manage the utilisa- creteiK t^ 011 o: ^ mean s of transport by pilgrims m such a way as to increase the revenue asl®; from koshan or road-tax, which constitutes a heavy charge on those using motor- transport for personal conveyance, as the majority of moderately well-to-do jafati pilgrims do, and those using camels, which are normally employed for the exact; transport of luggage. Complaints were made of the operation of a system, ? rfe| revived this year, w T hereby an official organisation, known as Naqaba, allots clients l e(ir to the various motor companies in such a way as to eliminate competition and place pilgrims at the mercy of the motor-owners. It is also stated that instructions were issued to load camels as lightly as possible, in order to increase i0 |P! the revenue from koshan and the responsible officials were accused of manipu- F lating the regulations so as to charge for camels in excess of the numbers actually used. This will be further explained in paragraph 81 below. 9. There was no improvement in the general condition of the roads between the main centres. A new road was opened to facilitate the journey to Arafat : - by motor car. The use of cars for transport to and from that place via Muna 1 was restricted more severely than in 1930, when the novel experiment of allowing 1 cars to be used on a considerable scale on this road (see paragraph 5 of the report for 1930) caused great confusion. In 1931 the privilege was confined to , members of the Royal Family with their suites and a limited number of officials and notable personages. Among those on whom it was conferred was the British ' Indian vice-consul. One reform introduced by the authorities this year proved a great blessing to pilgrims. Many of them had in the past suffered hardship ,u during the three days' halt at Muna on the return from Mecca to Arafat owing ; to the commandeering of houses there from the owners or from pilgrims who had 5 ' c : rented them in advance and had had them provided with drinking water, &amp;c., in s!lli ; advance. This year the Government equipped for their own use a well-found building, specially constructed and supplied with electricity and other con- veniences. This relieved the strain on the limited house accommodation •* available at Mima for pilgrims of the better class. Thanks to the measures taken by the Government and the small dimensions of the pilgrimage, these were able to rent houses at relatively reasonable rents, instead of relying on tents as the ip'r poorer pilgrims do. Although the Government requisitioned several houses at lie^ Mecca, no serious inconvenience was caused there, owing to the smallness of the it tie ^ pilgrimage. rclrf 10. Security was again well maintained in the pilgrim area, notwith- ntclf standing the presence in and about the towns of numerous half-starved Bedouin, c driven thither by penury in the interior. The British Indian vice-consul draws id,^ a pitiful picture of these famished and often naked unfortunates. The continued oi# maintenance of security is the greatest advantage conferred on pilgrims by the # regime of Ibn Saud and reflects much credit on the King, even though it be id ^ affected partly by the enforcement of punishments which would be considered jodr inhuman in less primitive conditions, e.g., the amputation of limbs or even the death penalty for robbery. It is a punishable offence even to touch unclaimed fpiit 1 articles on the roads. Notwithstanding this rigour and the safety which has ioiisf been assured on the pilgrim roads, there were many complaints in 1931 of petty e ci# thefts and pilferage in Mecca and even in the sacred precincts there. An [6274] b 24 unusual number of such thefts took place ac jVIuzdalafa, wheie pilgimis halt for the night on the return journey from Arafat to Muna. In some cases the culprits were believed to be Nejdi soldiers, whose pay was much m aneai. 11. There was again no IVloslem Oonference at JVlecca m I Jol. Ibn baud gave the now usual annual banquet to leading pilgrims of all nationalities. The cmests included many Indians. Egyptians came second m number, iheiiuniber of Javanese was again noticeably small. The King, spoke at length on the paramount necessity for unity of thought and action in the Moslem world, the importance of the Haj as an institution having for its pi imary purpose the assemblage of Moslems from different countries, the fallacy of reliance in the aping of Western civilisation, and his own indifference to all ambition or any object other than the glory of God and Islam. A tribute paid to the Indian leader Shauqat Ali by an Egyptian speaker elicited from His Majesty an angry denunciation of that personage, whom he criticised more particularly for having spoken of 'our brethren the Jews. He disclaimed all friendship with Jews and Christians alike. 12. The dispersal of the pilgrimage took place in good conditions and was effected without undue delay. The homeward shipping arrangements for British pilgrims may be described as generally satisfactory, subject to one or two observations on points of detail which will be dealt with in section 9 below. 13. The arrangements for recovering the effects of deceased pilgrims were again unsatisfactory. The tendency of certain mutawwifs to misappropriate such effects gives rise to complaint, and the attitude of the Hejazi Government in specific cases brought to their notice by His Majesty's Legation has not been sufficiently helpful to discourage abuse. 14. Despite the decrease in the total number of Indian pilgrims, the number of destitutes who had to be repatriated at Government expense was not far short of the figure for 1930. The majority were persons who had reached the Hejaz overland from Nejd, but there were also a considerable number of persons who had come by sea after being allowed to take single tickets at Indian ports. Financial stringency in the Hejaz had the effect this year of greatly increasing the number of pilgrims of various nationalities seeking the assistance of public authorities to get themselves repatriated after long or short sojourns in the Hejaz. The British Legation was compelled to apply for an increase m the small annual grant made by the Government of the Straits Settlements for this purpose. The disposal of African pilgrims of the poorer class, who can normally support themselves in the Hejaz until they have the means to return, also presented difficulty; and money had to be advanced on the security of a chieftain from the Aden Protectorate for the return of a party of his tribesmen. Numerous cases of destitution occurred even among the Javanese, usually the wealthiest class of pilgrims. Ihe Netherlands Government had no arrangements for repatriating these, and the Hejazi Government undertook to finance the return of about 100 of them. They were less generous to the Afghans and Bokharans, many of whom were left at the end of the pilgrimage without means of making the homeward journey. 15. Tne number of notable personages who made the pilgrimage in 1931 was considerable, notwithstanding the falling off in the total number of pilgrims. They included Sir Abdul-Kerim Ghuznavi, a member of the Bengal Legislative Councrl, who had made an earlier visit in 1913, and is keenly interested in all pilgrimage questions; M. M. A. Momen, Commissioner of the Chittagong JJmsron Bengal; Prince Ahmed Tevhid of Turkey, a grandson of Sultan Abdul Aziz and nephew to the last Caliph of Constantinople; two stipendiary chiefs A 1 ? 11 ! 6 11 P ro tectorate; and last, but not least, ex-King Amanullah of Arghamstan. The visit of the last named attracted great attention, and was ne occasion of a considerable influx of his supporters into the Holy Land. It may have inspired, also, the despatch of an official mission from Kabul and the 0 the Afghan Minister at Cairo. The notables included Moulana Soofi U a 1 i • ^ in ^ uen tial religious leader in Kathiawar, who is by origin an Aighan and is related to the Mujaddidi family. He is stated to have done much to counteract the political activities of Abdullah Khan. A number of n ian P 0 1 ^ lca l agitators also made the Haj, Some of these established or i enewed contact wth King Amanullah. One person in this category, however, Ismail Ghuznavi of Amritsar, proved to have modified his former attitude of antagonism to the British authorities in regard to pilgrimage matters. He enjoysj 11 Wahhabi circles, and rendered considerable assistance this year to the Bntisn Indian vice-consul. 16. Mi. H. B St. John Philby, now Sheikh Abdullah, made his first pilgilinage a tei embracing Islam in August 1930. Visits were paid to the Hejaz beiore and alter the actual pilgrimage respectively by Nawab Mar June: Bahadur foreign Minister to the Nizam of Hyderabad, and His Highness the JSawab 01 -Bahawalpur. 17. By arrangement between His Majesty's Minister and Commander Jackson of H.M.b. Dahlia, Red Sea Sloops, about twenty naval ratings from that ship and another which happened to be at Port Sudan were enabled to make the pilgrimage. They arrived at Jedda in H.M.S. ''Dahlia/' which made the usual visit to Jedda at pilgrimage time. 18. Theie was no trouble this year in connexion with forged rupee notes, the circulation of which gave rise to anxiety in 1930. It is probable that this traffic was discouraged by the success which finally crowned the efforts of the British Indian vice-consul (see paragraph 12 of the report for 1930) to locate the distributing agency in Syria, after which it was left to the French authorities there to pursue the matter. Shortly after the end of the 1931 pilgrimage the Hejazi [ nder-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty s Minister in great confidence of an alleged plot to introduce forged notes on a large scale into the Hejaz, and stated that his Government were taking active measures. Indian pilgrims, although spared the uncertainty caused last year by the suspicion cast on their paper money, suffered another form of inconvenience. One of the results of the depression in Hejazi merchant circles was that in many cases difficulty was experienced in cashing 'hundis,' or drafts on local commercial houses, purchased from their correspondents in India, an old-world form of exchange, the use of which still prevails widely in the absence of adequate modern banking facilities in the Holy Places. 19. His Majesty's Minister devoted much attention during the 1931 season, in close consultation with the British Indian vice-consul and the medical officer, to the reports of the Indian Haj Enquiry Committee. His observations and conclusions on all portions of these reports which concern the Legation in Jedda, and more especially the Indian and medical sections of it, were embodied in a series of despatches addressed to the Government of India and the Foreign Office. While the unavoidable delay in furnishing these reports is regretted, it enabled Sir A. Ryan to review the various questions in the light of a year's experience, and to bring many of them up to date. It is hoped that his conclusions, taken in conjunction with those arrived at in India by the Haj Enquiry Committee, will provide a basis for considered decisions on numerous matters affecting the welfare of Indian pilgrims, including the reorganisation of the Indian section of the Legation and' of the arrangements for supplying medical assistance to pilgrims. 20. There is nothing to record, in connexion with the other British sections of the pilgrimage, of sufficiently general interest to merit mention in this introductory portion of the present report. 21. There was again no sacred caravan or mahmal from Egypt in 1931, all efforts at a settlement of this and other questions outstanding between the Egyptian Government and Ibn Saud having failed. A new Egyptian consul, appointed to Jedda just before the pilgrimage, continued to discuss these matters without result, and the stage of formal negotiations had not been reached up to the time of writing. The difficulty of arriving at a settlement is understood to lie largely between the two Kings. Welcome as the arrival of a mahmal and the gifts it brings would be to the Hejazis as such, the objections due to Wahhabi puritanism are in any case hard to overcome. It is worth mentioning that, in the remonstrance addressed to Ibn Saud by the ulema of Nejd in the summer of 1931 (see paragraph 94 below), they commended him for his stand against the Egyptian mahmal. The Egyptian medical mission was again, however, treated with consideration during the 1^31 season. (2) Statistics. 22. As already stated, the estimated total number of overseas pilgrims fell from 84,821 in 1930 to 39,346 in 1931. The decrease in the numbers coming from ■the most important countries of origin was variable. It was particularly : i f I,s Flag. 1929. 1930. 1931. Number of Ships. Number of Pilgrims.

(3) Quarantine. 24. The usual sanitary arrangements were instituted at Kamaran, Tor and Suakin for the 1931 pilgrimage. Kamaran. '25. As in 1930, no Malayan pilgrims were landed in Kamaran, all having been vaccinated and inoculated against cholera in accordance with the legislation of their country of origin, in the same way as the Javanese (see paragraph 23 of the report for 1930). '26. Although effect has not yet been given in India to the recommendation of the Haj Enquiry Committee in favour of compulsory inoculation against cholera, the influence used by local authorities and ships' officers induced the great majority of pilgrims to undergo voluntary inoculation. This produced the gratifying result that only two steamers from India were compelled to land their passengers at Kamaran, all the rest being allowed to proceed, after medical examination only, in the same way as ships carrying the compulsorily inoculated Malayan and Javanese pilgrims. There was a corresponding reduction in the number of representations made to the Legation in Jedda, which in the past has been bombarded with complaints by pilgrims of the inconvenience and hardship entailed by landing at Kamaran to undergo quarantine. 27. Certain Pathans stubbornly refused inoculation, but one party of tliem, travelling in the steamship ' Sarvistan,'' yielded to the persuasion of the healtn officer at Kamaran when confronted with the alternative of being landed. The general experience of J931 shows the great advantage which would accrue to pilgrims themselves from the legal enforcement of inoculation in all cases, and the unimportance of the opposition that need be apprehended. Sir Abdul Kerim Ghuznavi informed His Majesty s Minister that he had been able, by • i • n en to al, to ensure the inoculation of all pilgrims sailing ^rom Calcutta, and it was due to his efforts that all those in the ship irom Bombay, m Vvhich he himself made the voyage to Jedda, were inoculated. I he results oi encouragement and judicious pressure in inducing the bulk of the Indian pilgrims to undergo inoculation iri 1931 were satisfactory, but these- methods cannot be regarded as an adequate substitute for legal compulsion, now that all intelligent Moslem opinion m lndia appears to be ripe for it. . • . ships proceeding from Kamaran to Jedda were found free from mfecUous disease, except for the occurrence of one case of chicken-pox in the steamship Jehangir. This case was isolated and sent to the local hospital for rea men 0 restrictions were imposed on the other pilgrims on board. 29. In view of the official information supplied by the Heiazi Government, and evidence from other sources that the pilgrimage should be regarded as clean, ships returning to India and Malaya were not required to call at Kamaran. As t i 0rrespon , de / c e Vitiated by Sir A. Ryan last year (see, ' c ^ -i 0 ' ne 1 e Port lor 1930), an understanding has been arrived atbetween ihe varioiis British authorities concerned as to the circumstances in which His Majesty s Minister may definitely dispense pilgrim ships bound for destinations south of the btraits of Bab-el-Mandeb from proceedine' via Kamaran. As one or two minor points are still outstanding at the time of writing m connexion with this understanding, an account of it is deferred until next year s report. Tor. 30. Ships carrying homeward-bound pilgrims northward w 7 ere submitted to the regulation quarantine of hours at Tor. Although the Alexandria Quarantine Boaid pronounced the pilgrimage clean after the first two shiploads of pilgrims had been subjected to the necessary medical and bacteriological tests, some suspicion arose later owing to the discovery of four healthy carriers of non-agglutinating vibrions and one carrier of agglutinating vibrions among the Egyptian pilgrims on board the steamship ' Ville de Damas ' on he? arrival at Tor on the 22nd May. This ship was detained for six days, but it was not considered necessary formally to declare the pilgrimage suspect, and the imposition of the normal guarantee of three days only was speedily resumed. In this connexion reference may be made to the conclLidino' portion of paragraph 24 of the report for 1930. 31. A delegate of the Alexandria Board was employed in the Hejaz during tlie pilgrimage season in accordance with the usual practice. Suakin. 32. Pilgrims returning to and via the Sudan were subjected to the regula tion period of five days quarantine at Suakin. The case of Sir Abdul Kerim Ghuznavi, who proceeded by this route from Jedda to Egypt, drew attention to the absence of first-class accommodation for pilgrims of the better class in the quarantine station there, although the difficulty was overcome in this particular case by the generosity of the medical officer in placing his ow-n house at Sir Abdul Kerim's disposal. Jedda. 33. No pilgrim ship w r as subjected to quarantine in Jedda this year. A few cases of chicken-pox and small-pox in arriving ships w T ere isolated and sent to the hospital in the town for treatment. 34. The buildings, &amp;c., on the quarantine islands outside Jedda are kept in a state of repair, but they lack essential equipment, e.g., disinfecting apparatus. The town hospital is similarly unprovided with equipment for disinfecting the clothing, &amp;c., of infectious patients 35. The port medical service was in 1931, as before, maintained by two doctors. It is complained that this staff is insufficient, especially when there are several vessels in port, to enable ships to be inspected and cleared without undue delay. It is suggested that the difficulty of doing so was aggravated by ill-feeling between the doctors, and their preoccupation with private practice. 36. The senior of the two doctors. Dr. Siuti, resigned shortly after the pilgrimage. This gentleman had in 1930 submitted a report to the King on the position of the Hejaz in regard to the International Sanitary Convention of 1926, which wa,s signed by Ibn Sand's delegate, but never ratified. There emerged from the discussion of the question a proposal that the convention should be ratified, subject to reservations designed to affirm the sovereign rights of the Hejaz. The proposal has not been pursued up to the time of writing, although the Hejazi authorities have manifested interest both in the 1926 convention, which, in its present form, they consider derogatory to their position as an independent Power, and also in a suggestion made unofficially by His Majesty 's Minister under instructions from home, that it would be in their interest to adhere to the Rome Convention of 1907, and thus secure permanent representation in the Paris Health Office. 37. Dr. Siuti's proposals in 1930 contemplated the reorganisation of the quarantine islands and a grandiose scheme for the creation of a camp on the mainland capable of accommodating 10,000 pilgrims. It was suggested that the estimated expenditure on this scheme, £40,000, should be obtained by imposing fresh taxes on shipping companies. It is pretty certain that the attitude of the Hejazi Government towards international sanitary arrangements [6274] c-10 is inspired much more by a desire to affirm theii authority as ^ sovereign and equal Power than to collaborate with other States m preventing the dissemination of disease by pilgrims. However desirable their participation m international arrangements may be as an ultimate ideal, it is more i«tn ou u \\ e her any measures they might take with their present inadequate equipment and personnel would produce useful results. They would be more likely to mfhef hardship, especially if applied to outgoing pilgrims, where rapi dispersal is a matter of the first importance. • i -u ^ ^ ioq - i -i • 38 In this connexion it may be mentioned that aitei tlie Ijol pilgnmagG blood tests were taken from the fingers of numbers of departing pilgrims by a quarantine doctor, acting in conjunction with 1 lofessoi Moshkovski of th© Tropical Institute in Moscow, who was for some time attached to the Soviet Legation m Jedda. Even this simple measui e, taken appaien11 \ m connexion with Professor Moshkovski s studies of tropical diseases, caused, in at least one instance, delay in the departure of a ship. It may be mentioned incidentally that Professor Moshkovski was recalled from Jedda soon after the pilgrimage. He had frequently lent assistance to the Hejazi authorities, and his removal deprives the Hejaz, at least temporarily, of the only specialist in bacteriology who has recently been available. It is too soon to say whether any reliance can be placed on two students who were sent abroad some time ago to study the subject, and who returned to the Hejaz this year. (4) Health. 'General. 39. The excellent health conditions which characterised the 1931 pilgrimage, as stated in section (1), must be attributed rather to favourable •climatic conditions and the smallness of the pilgrimage, than to any material improvement in the Hejazi sanitary service. There has been little increase in material equipment, and the number and capacity of the doctors employed has tended in recent years to diminish, a fact which may be attributed to financial stress and dissatisfaction on the part of the doctors themselves, all of whom have to be imported. At the best they are apt to be of inferior quality, in some cases ' discards ' ' from more progressive countries, and they are accused of exigency in the matter of fees. The Indian vice-consul cites the boast of one doctor, the occupant of a high official position in the Jedda Health Service, that, having been summoned on one occasion to attend an urgent case at Arafal (where the congestion and confusion on Pilgrimage Day always make it difficult to provide or obtain medical assistance), he withheld his services until he had been paid a fee of £15 in advance. 40. According to a report prepared by the Indian doctor attached to the Legation for the use of His Majesty's Minister in 1930, the extent of the then hospital and dispensary accommodation maintained by the Hejazi Government may be summed up as follows ;— Jedda. —One hospital, well but rather remotely situated at the southern end of the city. A municipal dispensary in the centre of the town. A small establishment run by the quarantine doctors at the port. A couple of rooms reserved for hospital use in the barracks outside the town. The hospital is served by two doctors, and a woman doctor is employed in addition during the pilgrimage season. The hospital doctors are responsible for all the establish ments enumerated except that at the port. They are also supposed to deal with public health matters. A certain supervision is exercised over food-stufts in the bazaars, but apart from this and some street-watering, little attention is paid to general hygiene. Mecca. One central hospital, not far from the sacred precincts. A small building used during the pilgrimage season for infectious diseases. A branch dispensary, some ten minutes' walk from the sacred precincts. A small building used as a lunatic asylum, little more than a lock-up for the patients. Muna. A temporary hospital, with twelve beds, is maintained during the festival days spent at this place on the return from Arafat. Road from Mecca to Arafat. —Wooden shelters with water cisterns were installed at intervals on this road in 1928 and were equipped for first aid. They are apparently no longer regularly staffed owing to the reduced number of doctors available, but in 1930 four ambulance cars patrolled the road.11 Road from Jed da to Mecca. Part of a recently erected house at Bahra is reserved for dispensary purposes. 1 here is no regular doctor and the equipment is small, but during the pilgrimage season a compounder administers first aid. Medina—Iwo small hospitals, served by two doctors and provided with medical supplies from stocks left by the Turks. Yamho and Taif. —Small dispensaries. 41. The above summary is greatly condensed and Sir A. Ryan has not been able to check it up to date. It is given by way of indication of the general scope of the establishment maintained by the Hejazi authorities, rather than as an exact statement of the present provision. It is only fair to state that the structure and equipment of the central hospital at Mecca have been greatly improved since 1928. Sir Abdul Kerim Ghuznavi, who visited it during the 1931 pilgrimage, was most favourably impressed by its general appearance. It is also fair to add that in their reports on the 1931 pilgrimage, the Indian members of the Legation commend the arrangements' this year at Mima, where the Hejazi Government provided a hospital with thirty beds and arranged for motor lorries to transport the sick to this hospital and to reserve them subsequently to the Central Hospital at Mecca. It is further stated that the twelve sheds on the road from Mecca to Arafat were duly provided with water, and were to some extent attended, although it does not appear that each shed could have been supplied with a doctor, in view of the smallness of the total number (three, not including the Director-General of Health) available in Mecca, from which place the service between Mecca and Arafat is maintained. 42. In view of these recent indications, it would be unjust to dismiss too lightly the constant professions of the Hejazi Government of their intention to increase progressively their equipment. At present, however, the service suffers greatly from paucity of personnel, lack of specialists, and, except in the case of the Central Hospital at Mecca, adequate accommodation and apparatus. Dr. Abdul Hamid further criticises, inter alia, the over-centralised arrangements for the supply of medical stores and the rapacity of the doctors in the matter of fees. 43. The Indian vice-consul has prepared the following statement of cases treated and deaths in Government hospitals, from official returns, for the period from the beginning of 1931 to the end of July. It may usefully be compared with the similar return for the ten months ending December 1930 in paragraph 28 of the report for that year :— Disease. Number of Cases. Deaths. Dysentery Paratyphoid Typhoid Puerperal fever Small-pox Measles Meningitis Leprosy Syphilis Diphtheria Malignant fever Dengue Consumption 262 137 5 5 49 42 48 45 621 329 60 38 10 9 S 9 230 10 1 1 24 22 4 3 163 80 Munshi Ihsanallah comments on the great increase in several instances in the proportion of deaths to cases in this list, compared with that which he made last year, on the high percentage of mortality in hospitals from such ordinary diseases as dysentery and paratyphoid; and in the lack of precautions to segregate infectious from other cases, even where there is an appearance of good organisation and equipment as in the Central Hospital at Mecca. • , i 44. Not only was the 1931 pilgrimage free from epidemics, but the total number of sporadic cases of disease were comparatively small. Numerous cases of dysentery occurred. Sunstroke was rare, thanks to the relative coolness of the weather. Typhoid was also rare. Cases of sore throat, nasal catarrh, &amp;c., were not numerous. Munshi Ihsanallah suggests that the lattei phenomenon was [6274] c 212 partly due to the small number of pilgrims landed at Kamaran on their way to the Hejaz, believing, as he does, that the exposure suffeied by piJgiims Prided there predisposes them to such maladies. Infectious and Contagious Diseases. 45. Although small-pox.is endemic in the Hejaz, no cases were brought to the notice of the Indian medical staft. It is suggested that this may be attributed to seasonal causes, the disease being, it is said, more apt to spread in winter than in summer. In support of this theory attention is dra^ n to the fact that the number of cases shown as having been treated in the local hospitals from January to July show T ed a marked gradual increase after January, in wdiich month 170 cases were admitted. Attention is drawn in this connexion to the fact that the pilgrimage season is receding through spring towards winter and to the failure of the Hejazi authorities to take effective measures to stamp out the disease. There was much talk of generalising vaccination in 1930, but no progress appears to have been made in this direction. The local arrangements for preparing vaccine are, moreover, unsatisfactory, and it is stated that the imported article, introduced in a dried form, will not retain its efficacy for long, owing to the heat of the climate. These matters are the more important, as small-pox is the only endemic infectious disease. 46. As stated in section (1), the only infectious disease among incoming Indian pilgrims was one case of chicken-pox. Mortality among Pilgrims. 47. There was $ marked decrease in the proportional mortality among all classes of pilgrims this year. The Javanese, for instance, who last year showed a death-rate of 8-2 per cent., this year showed only 3 per cent., the total number of deaths being 510 out of 16,803. The percentage was the same for the Malayans, of whom 17 died out of 506. Indian pilgrims showed a marked decrease, the proportion being less than 1 per cent, as against 3 per cent, last year. The total number of deaths during the three days at Muna w r as officially put at 32 out of about 50,000 pilgrims assembled there, as against 123 out of 100,000 last year. This decrease in general mortality is mainly attributable to the coolness of the season. General Sanitary Conditions. 48. Conditions generally w T ere similar to those recorded in paragraph 36 of the report for 1930. Reference has already been made in paragraph 40 above to the lack of serious attention to hygiene in Jedda. The same criticism applies to the other main centres. The measures for protecting food-stuffs from contam ination amount to very little. Something is done in the way of street -cleaning and the sprinkling of water mixed w 7 ith disinfectant. A new sprinkler, imported by the Jedda municipality was brought into use this year in the main thorough fares of that town. No progress has been made with measures to provide public lavatories, with the result that the practice of satisfying natural needs, more or less promiscuously, in public places continues to be common. The regulations obliging mutawwifs to use phenol for the cleansing of private lavatories are little observed, nor is their condition such that this remedy would do much to abate nuisances. The practice of emptying soak-pits only at intervals of four or five years makes them prolific breeding places for mosquitoes and other disease carriers, a fact which is held accountable for the prevalence of malarial and dysenteric disorders. Ihe delegate of the Alexandria Quarantine Board drew the special attention of bir A. Ryan to the lack of protection at well -heads, e.g., at Muna. 49. Owing, however, to the small dimensions of the pilgrimage, there was no congestion at Muna, and sanitary conditions were better than last year. The mam roads were kept clean. Water was sprinkled on them two or three times a day, a measure of limited efhcacy owing to the heat of the sun and the sandy nature oi the surface. The arrangements for the slaughter of sacrificial animals at una were again satisfactory, although it still happens that, contrary to regn- ations, animals are killed and left to decompose in the camp area, outside the railed enclosure provided for the purpose. i I50. It has been stated elsewhere that the weather at pilgrimage time was ls ¥ relatively cool. The maximum shade temperature recorded at Arafat was 110° F., falling to a minimum of 105° F. The temperature at Mima was steady at 95° F. or a little less. Water Supply. 51. Conditions in this respect were again favourable. Water was ■obtainable without difficulty at Jedda, Mecca, Mima and Arafat. Prices were more moderate than in 1930, being from 1 to 4 piastres per 4-gallon tin. The abundance of water at Muna and Arafat is due to the efforts of the managing committee of the Zubaida aqueduct, who deserve credit for their zeal and their honesty in the administration of the funds collected from pilgrims at the authorised rate of 8 piastres miri — 1 rupee a head. His Majesty's Minister does not hazard an opinion as to the quality of the water, as distinct from its abundance. Government of India Dispensaries. 52. In August 1930 a portion of the building occupied by the Chancery and other offices of the Legation at Jedda collapsed. This necessitated an overhaul and partial reconstruction of the building. The opportunity was taken of effecting much-needed alterations and improvements in the dispensary, which is housed in the ground floor of the house in question. The Government of India having sanctioned an expenditure of £145 for this purpose, considerable improve ments were effected. A room adjoining the dispensary was repaired and fitted for operations and a bed provided for the use of patients operated upon. The ■Government of India also supplied the necessary furniture. The dispensary is now fairly well found, although it still suffers from the need for accommodating it in part of a ramshackle building mainly directed to other uses. 53. The total number of patients treated in the dispensary for the period from the 16th May, 1930, to the end of June 1931 was 26,458, as against 25,359 last year. The number during the pilgrimage season proper, i.e., from the 15th February to the 19th Mav, 1931, including pilgrims and domiciled Indians, was 3,205, as against 4,301 last year. Eight patients were given hospital treat- ment. , • , i i i x- 54. A sum of £70, as against £102 last year, was realised by the sale oi medicines to non-British subjects treated in the dispensary. Out of this sum, £30 was spent on contingent expenses, the balance of £40 being credited to the Government of India. Mecca\. 55. A sum of £60 was sanctioned by the Government of India for carrying out necessary repairs to the dispensary. The requisite furniture, c airs ^ benches, &amp;c, were supplied by the Government before the commencement of the season. This greatly improved the general aspect of the dispensary. It is perhaps the first time in the history of the Indian pilgr image a e ispensary was opened as early as two months before the actua season, t.e., on 15th February. It was possible to engage locally a sub -assistant surgeon, instead of importing one as usual from India. A tempoiary coin P oim f e !i ^ engaged locally The sub-assistant surgeon, a retired member of the Indian semce, named Khan Sabib Mohammed Khan, showed himself to physician. He was, moreover, peculiarly happy m his dealings with P atle ^ s ^ attracted numerous Hejazis to the dispensary. Before e ar ^ , orfasion doctor at Mecca for the pilgrimage proper, the Indian vice-c , nressed of his visits to Mecca found Mohammed Khan and the f^^^rv to hardlv oamble of coping with the great rush. Fhis made it necebbarv -ve preferential treatmeiit to Indian patients and to relieve the compounder by detXng one of the two employed at Jedda. The dispensary was kept opened from 6 a . m . to noon, also for one hour in the afternoon ,, , ] Khan 56. Unfortunately the ability and re P' tatl °' *St^ excited the iealousv of the Svrian doctors employed by the Hejazi txovernment to OTch an extent that the Director-General of Health who had previously been willing himself to give him employment, refused to allow him to practise m i..14 town after the expiry of his temporary service under the Legation. This caused Mohammed Khan to leave the country. a , i i tt •+! i.- 57. The permanent Legation surgeon, JJr. Abdul Hannd, with his staff, proceeded to Mecca on the 16th April, to the great relief of the hard-pressed staff there. The total number of patients treated m the dispensary from the 15th February to the end of May was 12,1*25. A rafat. 58. Before proceeding to Arafat the Director-General of Health asked the Indian doctor to accompany him thither with his staff and medicines as part of the ' touring dispensarv organised by the ILejazi autnonties.^ As this would have compelled him not only to use the Hejazi flag, but to place himself under the direction of the Director-General, to the detriment of the special interests of Indian pilgrims. Dr. Abdul Hamid, falling in with the^ Indian vice-consul s suggestion, did not agree to the proposal, and went to Arafat with his own staff separatelv by car. There he stationed himself in the quarter where Indian pilgrims usually encamp. The season, however, being favourable, no requisitions for medical assistance were received. Muna. 59. A suitable house was again rented this year by the Indian vice-consul and the Indian doctor at their own expense. The dispensary was located in the same house. The total attendance during the three days' stay at Muna was 105. The patients treated were, with the exception of eight Malays, all Indians. Cases Treated. 60. The following table shows the approximate percentage of cases treated in the Indian dispensaries at Jedda, Mecca and Muna ; — i iljazi A U iisrc iii &lt; Medical. 1. Malaria and its complications 2.

About twenty major operations were performed. Minor operations numbered about 230. 61. The question of reorganising the arrangements for medical assistance to Indian pilgrims is one of those raised by the reports of the Haj Enquiry Com mittee. His Majesty's Minister submitted comprehensive proposals on the subject, prepared in consultation with the Indian vice-consul and Dr. Abdul Hamid, in a despatch to the Government of India, No. 49 of the 31st May, 1931. While not endorsing all the suggestions of the Haj Inquiry Committee, Sir A. Ry aI1 proposed a scheme which, he considered, would improve the present arrangements very greatly. The service would continue to be based on Jedda. A second dis pensary would be provided at Mecca, as an experimental measure during the busiest portion of the pilgrimage season. The provision of accommodation at Muna, during the three days spent there, would be placed on a sounder basis- loft JUtl \ H. \b 62. In the despatch just referred to, Sir A. Ryan dealt with the question of allowing Dr. Abdul Hamid to charge for attendance on pilgrims at their ntl| residences in Mecca (see paragraph 39 of the report for 1930). The demands of !■]% private patients caused no difficulty this year, thanks to good weather and the iryll small dimensions of the pilgrimage. The few calls which were received were attended to by both the doctor and the sub-assistant surgeon voluntarily and gratis. It, nevertheless, seems reasonable that the doctors should be allowed to make a charge for attendance outside the dispensary, except in the case of persons iltli;- genuinely in need of being visited elsewhere and too poor to pay for the privilege. istlii: Other Foreign Medical Assistance. 63. The Egyptian Government's Medical Mission arrived, as usual, a ■*fortnight before the Haj. It functioned at Jedda, Mecca, Muna and Yambo. % As before, it seemed well equipped, having many doctors, a lady doctor and three ambulances. The mission, while proceeding to Arafat, had left an ambulance with a doctor under the command of the local health authorities. The latter put l0 Kft the Hejazi flag on it with the words : ' Relief by the General Health Depart ment.' At Muna the mission generally helped the Egyptian pilgrims only. 64. The Netherlands Government maintained their usual medical service, which is roughly similar to that of the Government of India, although it differs Ml in detail. The Straits Settlements Government made arrangements this year for tad the Dutch doctor to attend to the needs of Malayan pilgrims at Mecca, instead of lias attaching a Malay dresser to the Government of India dispensary, as has been Mi done in the past. (5) Internal Transport. eatt Motor Transport. 65. The undoubted advantages to pilgrims in the way of convenience and celerity of movement resulting from the use of motor transport on the pilgrim ^ routes in recent years continue to be offset by the numerous abuses practised by motor owners, mutawwifs and officials, and the failure of the Hejazi Government 3 to repress them. Neither of the systems adopted during the last three years has ii given satisfactory results from the pilgrims' point of view. These systems are ; (a) that of free competition among the companies; and {h) the Naqaba system, instituted in 1929, under which an official organisation known by that name allocates pilgrims to the respective transporters. Each system has che backing of powerful vested interests, with the result that the attitude of the Government 'has been one of vacillation. 66. After being tried in 1929, the Naqaba system was abandoned in 1930, and free play was given to competition. A price-cutting war ensued between the transporters, and fares fell so low that it was impossible for them to maintain satisfactory services, keep their cars in good condition and defray expenses. Pilgrims, on the other hand, were deprived of any material benefit from the cheapness of transport owing to the action of the mutawwifs. The latter, while themselves taking advantage of the reduced rates actually charged by the motor companies, made every endeavour to recover from pilgrims the rates sanctioned by the Government. In many cases they were successful in pocketing the whole of the difference, although, as stated in paragraph 41 of the report for 1930, Indian pilgrims were charged less than the official rates as a result of the pressure brought to bear on the mutawwifs by the British Indian vice-consul. oropl 67 xhe result of this price-cutting competition in 1930 was to reduce the motor companies to a state of practical insolvency. Those interested in them |i0 and their backers induced the King to reintroduce the Naqaba system in 1931. ' The mutawwifs reacted by attempting to induce the pilgrims to use camels, urging that thev would thereby be following the example of the Prophet. At the t outset of the season some 2,000 pilgrims yielded to this persuasion. The I' Government and the motor companies were threatened with loss of revenue and ■ ; custom, respectively, and the King took drastic action. Holding the Jedda 'V agents of the mutawwifs responsible for the new development, he ordered their ^ ; dismissal and replacement by other agents. This brought the recalcitrant agents to heel. They sought pardon, and pledged themselves to do all in their power to e k [ replenish the Treasury by recovering taxes from pilgrims, with the resultfV&gt; \N ' 16 that they were reinstated within a few hours of their dismissal. The use of motor transport for personal conveyance was willy-nilly eniorced on pilgrims. In the event not more than 5 to 6 per cent, of the Javanese pilgrims, tor instance,, were allowed to travel by camel. i x ^ n 68. The revival of the Naqaba system was obviously to the advantage of the motor companies. It assured them ot their allotted snare of pilgrinis, and deprived them of any inducement to treat them with consideration oi to improve the quantity and quality of their rolling-stock, rhey cut down heavily their expenditure, and they did nothing to keep up the supply of touring cars to meet the requirements of pilgrims of the better class. Although, according to official statistics, the number of vehicles in good condition should have sufficed for all purposes, the supply was, in fact, inadequate, and dilapidated cars were freely used. It sometimes happened that the journey between Jedda and Mecca, normally a two hours' run, occupied as long as 24 hours. It is reported that, in some cases, the journey between Jedda and Medina took as much as six days, during which pilgrims were exposed to the risk of having to alight in remote and waterless places. 69. The authorised charges, which include Government koshan, or road tax, w T ere as follows : — Jedda to Mecca by lorry in the beginning of the season, 8 rials Ditto by car, £1 ... Jedda to Mecca by lorry in the season proper, £1 Ditto by car, £1 5s. Mecca to Medina and back by lorry in the beginning of the season, £10 Ditto by car, £12... Mecca to Medina and back bv lorry in the season proper £11 ios. ... ' ... ... ' x .. Ditto by car, £13... Rs. 11.0.0 13.12.0 13.12.0 17.3.0 137.8.0 165.0.0 158.12.0 178.2.0 70. The British Indian vice-consul remarks on the amount of time which the pilgrimage staff of the Legation have to devote to dealing with particular complaints, to the detriment of more important w r ork on behalf of the whole body of pilgrims. He assigns a large proportion of them to difficulties arising in connexion w-ith transport. He cites several concrete instances of the results in 1931 of the abuses referred to earlier in this section. These may be summed up as follows :— (a) A party of about 100 Indian pilgrims, including many of good standing, were to be carried from Mecca to Medina by the Alfi Motor Company. At the bidding of their mutawwifs they hurried at a moment's notice, and without luncheon, to the company's garage in Mecca, only to be kept waiting four hours for the promised cars. On arriving late in 3|forj the evening at Jedda, they found no cars for the omvard journey, nor had any accommodation been provided for them. Munshi Ihsanullah s intervention w T ith the parties concerned and the public authorities elicited a medley of lies, excuses and assurances, ending m a false start in cars unprovided with the extra tyres, &amp;c., required ^ F 1 arr . ied ^7 Medina-bound cars. This difficulty w r as overcome, and the pilgrims left for Medina on the third evening, but only as a result of constant and pressing representations by the Munshi. This was typical of several cases in which he had to intervene. ( ) In another case the transport company's employees refused to load the eiiects oi a party of pilgrims wdthout extra remuneration. On the refusal of the pilgrims to comply with w T hat they considered — unjustinaole demand, the emplovees plotted with the koshan officials to refuse permission for the cars to proceed. The drivers took them back to the garage, wdiere the pilgrims, including women and children, were mercilessly compelled to alight. The party was f i h0lirs ' no twithstanding the offer of certain pilgrims, s !oc ve( ' a | : the treatment of the women, to pay the money that had been demanded. This also is described as a typical case.17 (c) In several cases money was extorted from pilgrims on the pretext that cars had broken down, and that it was necessary to pay for help in repairing them, or that the money was needed to purchase benzine a( ] owing to unexpected shortage. In one case of the former kind the g) Indian vice-consul was able to secure redress and the imprisonment 01 ^ ie driver. He states that he procured the recovery of all sums J l |; extorted from Indian pilgrims for the alleged purpose of buying benzine, but that pilgrims of other nationalities suffered greatly from this exaction. (^) As an instance of the suffering caused by the use of dilapidated vehicles (sometimes, it is said, certified fit for service by venal officials), Munshi Ihsanullah mentions the case of six non-Indian pilgrims who 11 ^ had to alight for 36 hours in an inaccessible and uninhabited place, with the result that all six suffered severe sunstroke, and two died. him (e) Numerous complaints,' says Munshi Ihsanullah, 'were made by pilS pilgrims on account of the loss of luggage, unloading of their kit outside the cities with promises to fetch it with fresh conveyances from the garages, and removing it to different places or despatching it after long delays after the departure of the pilgrims themselves. I In many cases, even telegrams sent at a heavy cost could not prevail upon the companies to make the luggage, &amp;c., reach their respective : 111 owners in time. 0 % IS ftr ill :13ll The policy of the Hejazi Government in all matters relative to transport DJI would appear to have been largely dictated by a desire to compensate themselves as far as possible for the diminution of revenue caused by a small pilgrimage : 1^; by rigorous insistence on charges. Obstacles were put in'the way of pilgrims HI wishing to proceed direct to Medina after landing at Jedda, and the mutawwifs' agents had orders to collect in advance from such persons the whole of the dues HI payable in respect of the pilgrimage. Many pilgrims not unnaturally objected HI to this compulsory collection of such charges as mutawwifs' fees, house rent, tent hire at Arafat, &amp;c., in anticipation of the services being actually rendered, and ,. to being thus mulcted in sums for which those dying before reaching Mecca or compelled for any other reason to abandon the Haj would get no return. 1 ; Numerous complaints were made, but the Government could not be induced to v modify their attitude in a matter in which their own financial interest was involved. Indeed, in their anxiety to protect their revenues they ordered that Medina-bound pilgrims of the above kind should be charged a further tax of IP oo * * * * • • rv 33 piastres miri = rupees 4/2/-, to balance loss on koshan in one direction, viz., for the journey from Jedda to Mecca. 71. Under another new regulation imposed this year, pilgrims desiring to stop at Medina from eight to fifteen days were made to pay a tax of £1 5s., and a sum of £2 for any excess period up to a month. This appears to have dislocated | the arrangements for returning cars, owing to the difficulty of their being kept J;,' waiting for a limited number of pilgrims. A suggestion by the Indian vice-consul jjoit that the complement of passengers might be made up by admitting other passengers without regard to their allocation to particular companies encountered the strong resistance of the Naqaba official. His Majesty's Minister must confess ' to inability to grasp the ins and outs of this matter without further enquiry, and 11 ^ includes the foregoing account of it with reserve. 72. Reference was made in paragraph 44 a of the report for 1930 to the )lfl scheme for financing a Government transport company by means of a tax levied H': on the private transporters in consideration of their vehicles not being requi- 11 ' sitioned from time to time for Government use as in the past. The revenue accruing from this tax was duly expended on the purchase of cars. These were l ' ' put into the pilgrim traffic this year, and to the great pecuniary advantage of the 10 V. Treasury had a proportion of pilgrims allotted to them by the Naqaba authorities. ^; Persons' travelling by these cars suffered great hardsh ip owing to the arbitrary conduct of those in charge of the vehicles. The latter, being Government employees, were above restraint, no local authority daring to interfere with them. ' ; The British Indian vice-consul, though able in many cases to check the abuses practised by private transporters, could find no means of combating the ai®p misconduct of those in charge of the Government cars. He could only use his W- influence with mutawwifs and their agents to avoid wherever possible using them [6274] d18 for the transport of Indian pilgrims. 1 hose who benelited by his efforts in this direction were subjected to some inconvenience owing to delay in departure, but were amply compensated by not having to share the unfortunate experience of pilgrims carried in the Government cars. J 73. At the meeting of the National Conference soon after the pilgrimage (see paragraph 1) the private motor companies took exception to the action of the Government in itself engaging in the business of pilgrim transport in competition with them, ihis so angered the Director-General of finance that he threatened to dissolve the Government concern, but to revive the old practice of requisitioning. Some composition is understood to have been arrived at, but as it was oral little reliance can be placed on it pending the actual experience of another season. 74. A further stage was reached this year in the correspondence referred to in paragraph 46 a of the report for 1930, on the question whether the charge collected in advance for the return journey from Medina should be refunded in the case of pilgrims dying there. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs held that no refund could be allowed, as it would entail loss on the transporters who have to make provision for the return journey. There is little prospect of moving the Hejazi Government from this attitude. It would be sufficiently reasonable if the whole of the money charged were for transport. As it includes the Govern ment koshan or road tax, it may be argued that part of that tax at least should be remitted, but the Government, in their present financial straits, are unlikely to admit this. 75. The practice of commandeering cars for Government use was not entirely abandoned in 1931. On one occasion seventy pilgrims failed to reach Jedda in time to sail by the steamship Jehangir '' owing to their vehicles having been requisitioned by the Government for military transport. The pilgrims were compelled to make other arrangements, entailing additional expense for their journey to Jedda. It required the intervention of the Indian vice -consul to secure a refund of the return fares paid in advance to the company which was to have brought them back to Jedda in the first instance. 76. Owing to the inability of the Naqaba to provide suitable vehicles for pilgrims wishing to secure cars for their exclusive use. certain well-to-do pilgrims were driven to hiring cars belonging to members of the Royal Family. The rates charged were exorbitant in comparison with the ordinary rates officially sanctioned. _77. In the report on which the foregoing paragraphs are based, the British Indian vice-consul draws attention to the probable aggravation of the difficulties and hardships described in them, if and when regular motor routes for pilgrims are organised between the eastern coast of Arabia and the Hejaz. There has of late been much talk of the opening up of such routes from ITasa and/or Iraq to Mecca and/or Medina. Having regard to present financial conditions in the Hejaz and elsewhere, Sir A. Ryan considers the prospect of any of these projects taking shape in the near future so doubtful that he prefers to refrain from any attempt to foreshadow their possible consequences. (lam eh. 1 111 ilii'MK HI 'id 15 oft jred as 'ffld to /8. With the exception of a number of Javanese early arrivals, who travelled by camel in the circumstances related in paragraph 67, the great majority of pilgrims travelled by car this year. Ibn Sand turned a deaf ear to the appeal made lo him by a deputation of carpenters who make it their business to manufacture camel litters or shuqclufs throughout the year and store them for use during the pilgrimage season. These men are no less affected by the substitution of motor transport for camels than the Bedouin camel -owners. Being townsmen they are in a better position than the latter to approach the King. They complained that they had invested all they had in the litter business and had to pay rent for storage as well. They suggested that pilgrims should be allocated to cars and camels respectively in the proportion of two to one. Not only did they get no satisfaction, but the koshan (road tax) for camels was raised iiom .J.') piastres miri (rupees 4/6/—) to 70 piastres, with the result of approxi- rnately equalising tue inclusive rates for camel hire and motor hire. This step is stated to have been taken to discourage the use of camels by Indian pilgrim 8 - 1 hese are not officially denied freedom of choice, but, if they find that camel hire Ppilgri 141 on p iiwifc lofnol pgl mk', kk. i I As ftttlv J of Iff .tin Will ft'wrw .rstplil ifsa 19 is nearly as expensive as motor transport, they are apt to prefer the latter on grounds of convenience. 79. The number of pilgrims who travelled to Medina by camel was ij negligible. 1 ractically all, except those of the poorest class, who e^o on foot used ii,i: ■ motor transport. a 80. The camel hire for two people for the various journeys was as follows: Jedda to Mecca, 108 piastres miri = rupees 13/4/-. ^ Mecca to Jedda, £2 = rupees 28. Medina and back, £12 6 riyals = rupees 172/8/- % | Mecca to Arafat and back, £2 = rupees 28. The double charge for the return journey from Mecca to Jedda confers no advantage on the camel-owner, who receives the same amount each way. The surplus charge goes to the Treasury. _ 81. In the circumstances described in paragraphs 78 and 79 camels were mainly used for the transport of luggage. The devices mentioned in para graph 45 of the report for 1930 were again resorted to. Instructions were issued that the camels should be loaded as lightly as possible, in order to increase the amount of koshan payable to the Government, and the mutawwifs' agents were a! ® required to pay the tax in respect of a larger number of beasts than that actually ;r used in cases where the officials considered this number too small. The Indian vice-consul cites the example of luggage sufficient for four animals being loaded ;® r on six by the camelmen in order to spare their beasts, and of this number being :ai ^ disallowed as insufficient by the koshan collector after it had been authorised by the Sheikh-al-Mukharijin, the official responsible for the luggage arrangements ^ for Javanese pilgrims. He states that Indian pilgrims had difficulty in under standing why they should be charged in respect of camels not actually used and were inclined to attribute it to the dishonesty of their mutawwifs, who naturally passed on the excess charges to the pilgrims, but were not themselves responsible. He adds that, as a result of representations to the Governor of Jedda on many lev® occasions and his own direct intervention in certain particular cases, Indian todf pilgrims were on the whole treated fairly in the matter. ly, . 82. There was no shortage of camels for the journey from Mecca to Arafat, 'alt- Owing to the clemency of the weather and shortage of funds, many pilgrims preferred to go on foot. This was strongly discouraged by the authorities, ik; In order to comply with Government instructions to insist on camels being used, tied' the mutawwifs were driven to collecting a small amount at the start, in order to sfeji:: induce pilgrims to ride, and making them pay more on their return to Mecca. Tbt The hold on pilgrims which the regulations to be described in paragraph 102 gave i 'i. to mutawwifs, made it impossible for the former to resist this extra charge. This jitiff system of not definitely fixing the camel hire to Arafat until after the journey l\0 and keeping the pilgrims in the dark meanwhile, is a revival of a practice which jji?: prevailed in Turkish times. mi r# Arahas, i.e., Cahs. 83. As usual, motor vehicles were not allowed to enter the town of Mecca, ^■r Consequently, the only vehicles used to transport pilgrims from the outskirts of ^ Mecca to their quarters were the cabs. There was no fixed rate for these vehicles, 1 and on several occasions excessive charges were made. Owing, however, to the poor demand for transport of this class, the hire to Arafat, &amp;c., went down to earf; £5, as against £15 of last year. The mutawwifs, taking advantage of the ■ ignorance of the pilgrims and the absence of any fixed rate, charged considerably higher rates from the pilgrims and pocketed the balance. 1 his was the subject apR of many complaints to the Indian vice-consul. In a few cases he personally m arranged matters with the cabmen, although it was risky to do so in presence of 1# the regulation that no one other than the mutawwif is allowed to hire conveyances totf! for pilgrims. The difficulties resulting from the absence of a fixed rate were increased by the fact that the charges made vary according to the quality of the toil animals. 84. The Government imposed another unprecedented tax of 10 .S'. per head iaji on pilgrims travelling to Arafat by cab. ^ [6274] D 220 (6) Customs. 85. One of the measures adopted by the Hejazi Government to cope with its growing financial difficulties was the imposition towards the end of 1930 of increased customs duties. The duty on articles generally was raised by 5 per cent., subject to the following variations in the case of particular articles ;— Sugar raised from 12 per cent, to 17 per cent., plus \ piastre miri per oke. Tea from 12 per cent, to 17 per cent., plus 2 piastres miri per oke. Tobacco and cigarettes from 86 piastres miri per oke to 40 piastres miri per oke. Kerosene oil from 15 per cent, to 20 per cent., plus 5 piastres miri per tin of 4 gallons. Matches from 15 per cent, to 20 per cent., plus \ piastre miri per packet of ten match boxes. Motor accessories from 19 per cent, to 20 per cent. 86. The Government introduced in 1931 another new fiscal measure, namely, the imposition of a tax of 6 piastres miri on each tin of water from the holy well of Zemzem exported from the country. This is said to be without precedent in the history of the Hejaz. 87. Increased stringency was shown in the enforcement of customs regulations on pilgrims in 19:3i. When the first ship carrying Javanese pilgrims arrived, they were required to declare the contents of their luggage on a prescribed form, for which a charge of 1 piastre miri was made. This procedure caused great delay and hardship, although the number of pilgrims involved was only about 200. It was late at night before they were free to leave the custom-house. It was evident that the declaration system would break down as soon as ships began to arrive simultaneously carrying far larger numbers of pilgrims. It promised to impose so great a burden, not only on the pilgrims themselves, but on everyone else concerned, customs officials, mutawwifs' agents, porters and carters, that the Governor of Jedda and the president of the Haj Committee personally represented its impracticability to the King. He deferred to their objections and the declaration system was abandoned, other precautions being, however, taken to protect the finances of the Government. It was arranged that, in order to expedite the clearance of luggage, five exits from the custom-house should be provided instead of one, and that a customs officer should exercise strict supervision at each exit. Rigorous searches, involving in many cases several hours delay, were instituted. Complaints were made of the venality of the officials, and the mutawwifs' agents were accused of exploiting the situation by squaring the officials on the one hand and on the other hand making pilgrims pay for facilities, to the joint advantage of the officials and the agents themselves. 88. Pilgrims were formerly allowed to import rice for their personal consumption free of charge, a privilege of great value to those, e.g., the Javanese, v ho depend mainly on this food-stufi. This year it was decreed that duty should be charged on any rice in excess of 50 kilog. per head. This excited so much protest on the part of the Javanese pilgrims that the mutawwifs' agents were directed not to inform the pilgrims of the new requirements, but to collect instead on behalf of the Government an additional tax of 5 piastres miri (10 annas) per head, plus 1 piastre miri for the declaration sheet. 89. I he position, as it affected Indian pilgrims, may best be described in the language used by the Indian vice-consul in his report to His Majesty's i inistei. The situation, he says, ' became very difficult on the arrival of the ndian pilgnms, who are generally known here as 'the pilgrims with guardians ; lt i ttie | 1 ' Presence of the Indian vice-consul on all occasions of the ' ll llva &lt;)L !i!( 'ian ships proved a great hindrance in the illegal ways of both the agents and the customs officials. The Indian vice-consul could, and did, stop the illegal treatment and pilfering, &amp;c., during search, whenever he or his staft' €oul(I be availed of, but he obviously could not prevent the officials from the legal (ist arge ot then duties in searching the luggage of the pilgrims or charging cues on aitides which they named to be liable for customs duties. On one occasion it happened m the presence of the Indian vice-consul that the if am ji! tie 1 It si ifi®i m\ ire; life aies aem sfron Raleiit wer, %il p®, ^otl None ^ibd Wly Woi Joloii. It ' v ! 21 of a respectable and important Sindi pilgrim was searched, which consisted of a few pieces of clothes and cooking utensils of ordinary copper, which being tinned looked as ii silvei-plated. 1 hough it was made clear to the customs officers that the utensils weie of copper only, but tinned, they refused to accept the statement. Verbal protests to the Governor and other high authorities of the customs proved of no avail, and the pilgrim was charged something like £5 on the articles, which was, however ieduced at the personal protest of the Indian vice-consul This was only one of the numerous cases which the pilgrims had to face for not taking to the easier means of satisfying the avarice of the officials. The contrast is explicable by a diffeient incident, in which a mutawwif's agent charged a party of rich Memons under his care a sum of 12 rupees to bribe the customs officers with a view to getting the luggage cleared from the customs. And the result was that the luggage of the party, consisting of nearly fifty bundles in number, was allowed to pass after only a nominal and showy search without any difficulty or unnecessary detention. ! he matter subsequently came to the notice of the Indian vice-consul, who summoned both the pilgrims and the agent. Although the pilgrims confessed that by paying such a small amount they had been spared many troubles and difficulties, which otherwise would have been immense, the Indian vice-consul could not let it pass as it was, lest one unchecked crime should encourage the defaulters to burden the over-taxed pilgrims with yet another fresh one. Accordingly he recovered the amount from the agent and delivered it to the pilgrims. It was, however, thought inadvisable to take legal action against the official, in view of the fact that the agent who had to deal day and night with these officials would not dare to incur their displeasure by giving evidence against them. And, moreover, such a course would have proved detrimental to the interests of the pilgrims, inasmuch as it would have subjected them to stricter searches and the consequent troubles and detention, while that could be easily saved on payment of a few rupees, as illustrated in the above two cases. However, the agents were seriously warned not to charge their pilgrims anything in future in this respect, this could not stop the prevailing practice, as many cases came to notice in which the agents, having expressed their inability to act as inter mediaries to bribe the officials to clear the luggage of well-to-do pilgrims, these latter had to be given liberty to a certain extent to deal with the customs officers direct. This procedure deprived the agents of the mutawwifin of a certain portion of their legitimate amount, which they had actually invested from time to time in the custom's officers, from their own pockets in anticipation of earning more from the rich pilgrims under their care. This practice, however, remained prevalent throughout the pilgrimage season under review, and altogether knowing the facts full well, the vice-consul did not think it feasible, for the reasons mentioned before, to take any legal action against the officers. The pilgrims, moreover, who verbally reported the matter to him, eventually refused to record their statements for official action.'' 90. Although, as stated in paragraph 77, His Majesty's Minister considers it premature to deal with the possible consequences of the fixing up of organised pilgrim routes from the eastern side of Arabia, it may be noted that Tbn Saud has already devoted attention to the organisation of the customs service on the Hasa coast. He despatched thither last year a mission under Muhammad At-Tawil, a Jedda notable, who was formerly much identified with the Hashimite regime, and is reputed to be the ablest of the Hejazis, to study the economic situation, including the possibility of organising the trans-desert route, and, among other things, to reform the customs service. At-Tawil would appear to have done a good deal in the latter direction in the teeth of much local opposition. I I (7) Religious Policy. 91. The 1931 pilgrimage produced no very material change in the situation described in paragraph 49 of the report for 1930. In the latter part of 1930 and the early months^of 1931, there was a relaxation, very welcome to the Hejazi populations of the towns, of Wahhabi vigour. The activities of the Amar-al- Maroof, or Committee of Virtue, were so greatly curtailed that, while not actually abolished, it ceased to be an important factor. Ihe special Nejdi police attached to it were done away with and their functions transferred to the ordinary police, who were instructed to conhne themselves to notifying the public of the regular ■f:!hours for prayer. There were many signs that the iviiig had adopted a policy of greater compromise and tolerance, one of his motives, peitiaps, being not to discourage the pilgrimage at a time of economic and iinancial stiess merely to gratify the fanaticism of the extremists among his own subjects, lie is credited with a public utterance to the effect that a party of four piigrims was of greater value to him than a clau of Bedouin. The hopes of the Hejazis were stimulated by developments between Egypt and the Hejaz, v, inch, at the end ot 1930, appeared favourable to the revival of the Egyptian Alahmai 01 bacred Caravan. 92. These easier conditions were reflected in the treatment of pilgrims in 1931. The Legation received no complaints from British pilgrims of hardship or interference with their religious observances, except peihaps at the i icphet s Ti mb at Medina, where it was necessary to bribe the Nejdi guards in-order to be allowed to touch and kiss the railing round the grave. 93. Many pilgrims continue to be shocked by the disregard shown for other tombs, &amp;c. This is especially true of those of the Shia denomination, who were, moreover, again disappointed in 1931 in their hope o! receiving more liberal treatment as a result of the treaty concluded some time ago between Hejaz-Nejd and Persia. They were subjected to an extra tax of 10s. per head collected with the motor fare to Medina. Many Indian Shias represented their grievances to the Indian vice-consul, and one of them, a retired Government olficial of some standing, addressed a letter to His Majesty's Minister in which he complained of the extra taxation just mentioned and other disabilities suffered by Shia pilgrims. There appears to be good ground for all or some of these grievances, although Sir A. Ryan could only state that it would not be possible for him to intervene without departing from the settled policy of His Majesty s Government of neutrality in religious matters and non-interference in the Holy Places of Islam. 94. It is to be hoped that the Hejazi Government will continue to use in the main a wise toleration in their attitude towards pilgrims to whom extreme Wahhabi principles are repugnant. It must, however, be recorded that soon after this year's Haj, the internal policy of Ibn Saud underwent a change in the direction of greater rigidity. The Ulema of Nejd, having remonstrated with him on what they held to be the impropriety, from an Islamic point of view, of per petuating the celebration of his succession to the throne of the Hejaz, first held in 1930, and repeated in January 1931, the King published the remonstrance in the Mecca newspaper, ' Umm-al-Qura,' together with a reply in which he deferred entirely to their views. At the same time the Committee of Virtue was reinstated in its powers in the various Hejazi towns and Nejdi soldiers, numbering 260 in Mecca, were employed to enforce the religious observances in a drastic manner. There was renewed stringency in various directions, e.g., the prohibition of public smoking (although the importation of tobacco is allowed and is an important source of revenue, being widely used, even by Nejdis). Some attempt was also made to enforce the law forbidding gramophones and other forms of music. It may be assumed that these measures are dictated less by a change in the King's personal sentiments than by his desire to rally the extremists to his support in a troublous time. It would he unfortunate if the new policy were extended to foreign pilgrims, who had, as has already been stated, little to complain of in 1930, subject to their renouncing visits to tombs and other shrines and concentrating on their main object, the performance of the Haj proper, as a duty enjoined on all Moslems. 95. The following passage on Wahhabi activity generally may be quoted textually from Munshi Ihsanullah's report :— ' The Wahhabi Government,' he says, ' do not appear to be engaged in vast activities to propagate the Wahhabi doctrines, as was reported in 1929; nevertheless, they are not totally silent on this point. The financial stringency has compelled them to limit their propaganda and confine it within the sphere of their influence. They discourage the educational institutions from imparting to the students anything other than the Wahhabi teachings, and insist on having Wahhabi treatises taught in the schools. On the revival of the Religious Committee, Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Hasan went to Medina and closed down the religious institutions of the Hanafi sect on the refusal of the latter to admit in its course books of the Wahhabi faith or appoint a teacher of the Wahhabi belief. This school was run by a leading Alim, who comes from the family of the Frangi Mahal, ulema' in Lucknow. His exalted\ 23 Highness the Nizam of Hyderabad is one of its principal patrons. Besides mteiieimg in t .ie CLirncnkim of educational institutions, the Wahhabi Government mrther extended their spirit of intolerance to several personal liberties of the people. Recently the members of the Patam community, who are individually subjects of the British-protected Indian State of Baroda but domiciled as a mercantile community in the Hejaz for centuries, have been semi-officially ordered not to put on their national head-dress at Mecca, on the grounds that it resembles that of Christians. One of them was actually prevented from perfoiming his tawwaf in the Haram at Mecca with his turban on. .... (8) Mutawwifs. 96. Paragraphs 51 to 61 of the report for 1930 gave a comprehensive description of the system whereby all overseas pilgrims are placed in the hands &lt;jf the recognised guides known as mutawwifs and their agents, together with some account of the defects of the system and the abuses which accompany it. The following paragraphs bring the subject up to date, with reference to developments in 1931. Authorised Charges. 97. This subject can best be dealt with here as the bulk of the charges annually sanctioned by the Hejazi Government pass through the hands of the mutawwifs and their agents m Jedda. The Government delayed greatly the publication of the tariff for 1931. In spite of repeated efforts on the part of the Legation to obtain it, the tariff was only made available late in January immediately after, and possibly because. His Majesty's Minister had sent an en clair telegram to the Government of India reporting his inability to ascertain the scale of charges and suggesting that pilgrims must take the risk of uncertain expenditure. When communicated to the Legation it was found to be practically identical with the tariff for the previous year, except in one important particular. The inclusive fee payable to the mutawwif for his personal services, accommodation in Mecca and certain other items was increased so as to_ allow the mutawwif a definite margin of personal remuneration. This fee varies according to the nationality of the pilgrims. The rates fixed for 1931 for the principal categories of British pilgrims were 54 rupees for Indians generally, including Bengalis, as against 33 rupees in the previous year; 20 rupees plus cost of accommodation for Malabari, Sindi and Suleimani pilgrims; and £8 for Malayans, who are charged on the same scale as the Javanese. It was estimated that the increase for Indians would leave the mutawwifs a margin of profit of 10 rupees. This was a step in the right direction as mutawwifs, with all their defects, have had their own legitimate grievances, what with having to deal with impoverished pilgrims on the one hand and an ever more exacting Government on the other. The only hope of ever making them honest as a class lies in assuring to them a fair return for what they do. 98. The Government reversed the policy of the previous year by publishing the scale of charges for the 1932 pilgrimage unusually early, very shortly, in fact, after the end of the 1931 season. This was probably done with the object of encouraging pilgrims to come forward by diminishing uncertainty as to the cost of the pilgrimage, although it must be noted that these tariffs leave for subsequent fixation the most important items of all, namely, the authorised charges (including Government road tax)^ for transport. In the tariff for 1932 the mutawwif's fee for personal services, &amp;c., was found lower than in 1931 for all pilgrims except those from the Dutch East Indies and Malaya, being reduced to 40 rupees for Indians generally and 15 rupees, plus cost of accommodation, for Malabaris, &amp;c. These reductions were presumably intended as a further attraction to pilgrims. 99. The tariff for the year 1931 is reproduced for convenience of reference in Appendix B to this report with notes showing the only alterations made in the tariff for 1932. Charges at Medina. 100. The charges for muz aw wars or local pilgrim guides at Medina (see Paragraph 61 of the report for 1930) are not fixed by the Government in the same 40**'wiv as those oavable to the mutawwifs at Mecca and their agents in Jedda. In some cases the Mecca mntawwif takes a fee in respect of the service to be rendered bv a mnzawwar e!/.. Bengali pilgrims going to Medina are made to pay their mutawwifs 12 rupees each on this account. The Indian vice-consul constders this excessive and it is said that only from 2 to 3 ™pees actnal y go to the muzawwar, the mutawwif in Mecca pocketing the balance. I he attention of the Hejazi Government has been called to the desirability of fixing authorised charges for the muzawwars services as well as for housing at e ma. Charges for Zamzam and Zubeyda W ater. 101 The Question has also been raised of scheduling the charges for^water from Zamzam and Zubeyda, the uncertainty of which, accoiding to the Indian vice-consul, gave rise to many complaints this year. 'New Regulations. 102. On the 3rd April, when the influx of pilgrims was in full swing, the authorities at Jedda suddenly brought into application a new regulation prepared in Mecca, but not actually published until a week later. The mutawwifs' agents in Jedda were to take possession of pilgrims passes or passports in exchange for a printed identity card, to perform any necessary formalities at their consulates, and then to forward the passes, &amp;c., direct to the mutawwifs at Mecca. The latter were empowered to retain them until after the pilgrimage, when they were to be returned to their owners direct or through the agents in Jedda. The immediate causes of the promulgation of this regulation were not very certain. It was, however, obvious that, notwithstanding a clause threatening mutawwifs with severe penalties in the event of their retaining passes without due cause at the end of the season, the effect of the regulation as a whole must be to place pilgrims even more than before at the mercy of mutawwifs' agents and mutawwifs. It made the pilgrim pass a pledge, as it were, for the payment of dues. It was likely, moreover, to create great confusion owing to the danger of the passes being lost or mixed up. His Majesty's Minister took strong exception to the innovation, on the double ground that pilgrims should not (as was at first intended apparently) be prevented from attending personally at their consulates for the performance of any formalities required by their national authorities, and that they should not be indefinitely deprived of their papers of identity by a foreign authority, much less by mutawwifs, &amp;c., whom Sir A. Ryan regarded as private persons, however much their status might be officially recognised. On his threatening through the Indian vice-consul to make strenuous representations to the Central Government, the local authorities, after themselves consulting Mecca, desisted from any attempt to prevent pilgrims from attending personally at the Legation. Having established this point. Sir A. Ryan addressed a note to the Hejazi Government in which he made strict reservations, pending reference to His Majesty's Government, regarding the other point, viz., the retention of passes by mutawwifs' agents and mutawwifs. His Majesty's Government shared Sir A. Ryan's views, and he was in due course authorised to confirm his reserva tions by a definite protest. He was given discretion as to the time and manner of his action. Having gathered from conversations with the Under -Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that the new regulations, though they w T ere enforced up to the end of the 1931 season, were likely to be rescinded, he postponed further action in the hope that this would happen before the outset of the 1932 season. 103. As a corollary to the new regulations, the authorities in Jedda required pilgrims' passes to be endorsed by the mutawwifs' agents before authorising the departure of pilgrims from the Hejaz, in order to show that all dues had been paid. Chis requirement placed a formidable weapon in the hands of the mutawwifs and their agents. 104. The Government contemplated levying a tax equivalent to about 105. on pilgrims unable to produce their passes on their return from the Haj owing to their having lost them. Return tickets deposited at the Legation are returned to such pilgrims, provided there is no question of fraud, and the imposition of the proposed tax would have caused hardship at a time when pilgrims are apt to have pretty well exhausted their resources. - The Indian vice-consul was able to se?the matter lu fretting the Governor of Jedda to issue unofficial certificateswmmm , s ! ^ ft 25 that the passes had been lost, and the mutawwifs' agents, in their turn affixed to the certificates the necessary endorsement to the effect that nothinp- was due bv the holders. ^ Reform Proposals. i i +T1? 6 tl Ues ^ 0I l T o ^. re ^ rm i n g the mutawwif system was one of those debated at the Hejazi -National Conference (see paragraph 1). The discussion would appeal to have been heated, some accusing the mutawwifs of bringing; the Government into discredit by maligning it to pilgrims, of inducing the latter to address complaints to their national representatives, and of getting money out of the tender-hearfed b;y pretending that they w T ere themselves squeezed, while others declared that it was the inhabitants of Mecca, not the mutawwifs who poisoned tne pilgrims minds. One sensible suggestion emerged from the discussion, namely, that the Government should find some means of collecting taxes other than that oi using the mutawwifs as middle-men. The whole subiect was reserved for further consideration, and no change has been made in the system so far The King, however, judging by his published utterances at the conterence and by what is otherwise known of his attitude, would appear to be fully aware of the corruption prevailing and the need for reform. Before leavm 0 ' for Riadh in June he took the definite step of dismissing the Sheikh Al-Mutaw- wifin, the head sheikh of all mutawwifs m Mecca other than those responsible for Dutch East Indian pilgrims. Unfortunately the new incumbent is unfamiliar with an} Indian language, and therefore ill-qualified for work which lar^elv concerns Indian pilgrims. The British Indian vice-consul considers that there should be a separate sheikh for the Indian pilgrimage as there is for the Dutch East Indians, just as there is a separate naqib, or headman, of the mutawwifs' agents dealing with Indian pilgrims in Jedda. Munshi Ihsanullah has greatly exerted himself to promote reform on sound lines. In view of the obvious difficulties of official intervention in a matter so delicate, he has done his best to enlist the support and sympathy of distinguished foreign pilgrims and others standing well with Ibn Sand, urging the advantages which the' Hejazi Govern ment would derive from a healthy reorganisation from the point of view both of their credit with the Moslem world and their finance. He pays special tribute to the assistance rendered this year by Moulvi Ismail Ghuznavi (see para graph 14), though the departure of the King for Riadh and that of Ismail Ghuznavi for India supervened before anything concrete could be accomplished. 106. In this connexion it may be observed that the Hejazi Government, though so slow to put their house in order, are as sensitive as ever as regards foreign intervention, and too often present the appearance of upholding the mutawwifs. &amp;c., whose interest it is to make themselves independent of such control as diplomatic and consular representatives can directly or indirectly exercise. His Majesty's Minister, while careful to respect religious suscepti bilities, has consistently held that the British pilgrim is a British traveller, the special object of whose journey does not deprive him of the right to the protection and assistance of British officials in matters affecting his temporal interests. Impoverished Pilgrims and Mutawwifs. 107. A good many Indian pilgrims, some 200, had difficulty in leaving Jedda after the pilgrimage owing to their inability to pay off their mutawwifs, who had the whip-hand of them owing to the operation of the new regulations described in.paragraphs 102 and 103. His Majesty's Minister, feeling strongly that if on the one hand mutawwifs need to be strictly controlled, they should nevertheless get their legal dues, was loath to intervene officially, but after satisfying himself that the pilgrims in question, though provided with return passages, were without other resources, he made an unofficial appeal ad misencordiam through the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. This, coupled with the efforts of the Indian vice-consul, assisted again by Moulvi Ismail Ghuznavi, led to the demands of the mutawwifs being waived. It is fair to say that, though there was a good deal of official obstruction before the pilgrims were allowed to go, the King showed generosity in the matter, and a direct representa tion by Munshi Ihsanullah to the Director-General of Finance (a personage whom the Legation seldom has occasion to praise) contributed materially to the happy ending. [6274] e •k i i ; I l\h26 |p 111 liotoi ■firf ^ M ■ jttofD ^lave $M \ , is ID I jitolto litle Black List. . . inOA , |&gt; 108 The black list system, adopted by the Legation m .330 (see para- graph 60 of the report for 1930, proved a useful instrument m mducing notoriously til-behaved mutawwifs to mend their ways , T ^, ^ ^ with elasticity, and certain mutawwifs who had been black-listed last year were allowed to go to India this year, though without being placed on the recom mended list'' to be mentioned presently Some others who have been the subject of numerous complaints this year, have been added to the list the fmther step has been taken of forwarding to the Government of India a list of recommended mutawwifs,' comprising twenty who are conversant with the Bengali language and suitable for pilgrims from Bengal, and twenty for other provinces It is hoped that pilgrims mav be judiciously advised in 1 ndia to choose theit miitav. w ifs fiom this list, so as to put a premium on good conduct on the part of mntawwifs generally. Taqrir System. 109. The methods described in the preceding paragraph have had some effect in imposing better conduct on the mntawwifs competing for the custom of pilgrims who enioy freedom of choice, but cannot be applied to those eiijoymg the monopoly of certain pilgrims under the Lacjrir system (see pai agiaph 53 a of the leport for 1930) Fortunately there has been no extension of Taqrir. Among those subject to it are Indian Moslems of the Memon community. A leading member of the community attempted this year to contest the imposition oi a mutawwif by the Heiazi Government. He appealed to the Legation, which, howevei, did not feel that it could interfere with the established custom. Lhe applicant and his friends had perforce to accept the legally recognised mutawwif. In another case, a pilgrim who, though resident m the United Provinces, nad taken out a passport in Bihar, the pilgrims from which district aie undei facpii, was claimed by the mutawwif for Bihar after he had placed himself in the hands of another mutawwif of his own choice. On his complaining to the Sheikh Al- Mutawwifin he had a cavalier reception. 1 he Indian vice-consul eventually arranged for the pilgrim to revert to the mutawwif whom he wished to employ, but only after he had bought off the Bihar mutawwif by paying his dues. These cases illustrate the helplessness of pilgrims subject to the Taqrir system, the total abolition of which would be a boon. IB, 2ffif ieleri Deceased Pilgrims' Estates. 110. The Indian vice-consul cites two specific cases this year in illustration of the danger of deceased pilgrims' property being misappropriated by mutawwifs. In one case he was informed by a respectable pilgrim from Bihai that a female companion of his had died leaving 300 rupees, £15 and jewellery. The mutawwif having taken charge of the effects, ostensibly to hand them over to the Beit-ul-Mal, the proper Hejazi authority, actually deposited only 80 rupees. In the other case, an Indian notable named Moulvi Nisar Ahmed used to come annually on Haj, bringing with him merchandise which he left with his mutawwif. He died, leaving, it is said, about 2,000 rupees in the possession of the mutawwif, who is accused of having appropriated the amount. Both cases have been taken up by the Legation. Miscellaneous. ^ y 111. In certain cases in which mutawwifs had got possession-of pilgnms passes under the new regulations (see paragraph 102), they handed them oyer to impostors, who succeeded in getting hold of the corresponding return tickets deposited at the Legation. Owing to the control exercised over the issue 0| passes, the fraud was detected when the real owners presented themselves, and it was possible to compel the illegal recipients of tickets to make good their value. Such incidents nevertheless illustrate one of the practical disadvantages of the new regulation, as distinct from the strong objections to which it is open in principle. 112. The Indian vice-consul states that miscellaneous complaints of tne familiar kind against mutawwifs, their agents and their sabees or apprentices were much more numerous this year than usual. His description of them ^ reproduced in his own words as follows : ' The pilgrims in some cases were charged the mutawwif's fee over and above the scheduled rates, as was the hire -4 I T e }\ ^ril. an T Pre ft37 for motors and arabas—-the latter for the journey from Mecca to Arafat. Extra charges weie made toi the necessary kit, which hitherto the pilgrims were allowed to take with them 11 ee of charge. I his was, it is said, done with the co-operation of the motoi owners at the time when pilgrims had seated themselves in the cars and were about to start, ihose who refused to pay were detained. The free choice of pilgiims in the purchase of sacrificial animals at Mina was greatly hindei ed. Pilgums fi om I eshawar, North-West hrontier Province, were, in respect of mutawwifin s fee, treated as pilgrims from the Punjab, whereas the formei have to pay a smaller fee than the latter. In many cases the cash entrusted by certain pilgrims to their mutawwifin for safe custody, both in the Hejaz as well as in Iiidm pi 101 to their departure were embezzled, forged accounts being presented to make up the balance. Remittances made by the relatives of pilgrims through their mutawwifin were not delivered in full till the Indian vice-consul threatened to lefuse them permission for the journey to India. Instances of the mutawwifin marrying Bengali women, bringing them here, stripping them of all their belongings and then divorcing them and driving them out penniless and helpless, were again not lacking. Cases of the mutawwifin charging pilgrims for both journeys, but actually purchasing single steamer tickets, which fact the latter came to know on reaching Jedda, also came to notice.' 113. Munshi Ihsanullah attaches importance to a case of a different kind, for which he knows no precedent and which may be placed on record, although the attitude of the woman concerned made it impossible for the Legation to take official cognisance of it. A respectable Indian from Sind brought on Haj the wife of one of his servants. She was missing when the party were about to leave Mecca on the return journey to India, and was traced to the'house of a person of bad character, who is a favourite of the Amir Faisal and reputed to serve him as a pander. She had apparently been removed to this house from that of the mutawwif in unascertained circumstances. Ismail Ghuznavi, who assisted Munshi Ihsanullah in the matter, saw the girl and vainly endeavoured to persuade her to go back to India. In these circumstances he could do nothing further, and the woman remained in Mecca, notwithstanding the efforts of her late employer to procure her return. (9) Indian Pilgrimage. 114. this section deals with various matters connected with the Indian pilgrimage which have not already been covered in the more general preceding sections. 115. The arrivals of ships carrying Indian pilgrims in 1931 began with that of the steamship 'Rezwani,' which reached Jedda on the 13th January with 865 pilgrims, and ended with that of the steamship 'Rehmani' on the 22nd April. As was the case last year, only two lines, the Mogul (Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co., Ltd.) and the Nemazi, were engaged in the traffic. 116. The following table shows the number of pilgrims from each province of India and Ceylon, classified according to ports of embarkation ;— B ritish Subjects. Province. Bengal and Assam Punjab Bombay United Province Madras Sind Bihar and Orissa Central Province Baluchistan N.w.F.P. ... Hyderabad (Deccan) Delhi Burma Ceylon [6274] Bombay. Karachi. Calcutta.

The above table shows that the total iiunibei of pilgnnis coming from British India and the Native States was 7.292 as against 11,061 last year. The decrease was mainly due to the falling off in thejmnibei oi pilgrims from Bengal and Punjab, of whom there were 1,261 and 1,351 i especti\ely, as against 3,706 and 2,003 last year respectively. 118. The reduced number of Indian pilgrims this year is attributed to the fall in the price of Indian products and to general trade depiession throughout the country. The cultivators and other poor classes seemed to ha\e been much affected, as it was among these that the decrease was most marked. This year's Haj was, indeed, remarkable for the unusually large proportion of well-to-do and educated pilgrims, including high Government officials, &amp;c. 119. The following list shows the number of non-Indian pilgrims who travelled to the Hejaz via Indian ports :— Nationality. Bombay. Calcutta. Karachi. Total Chinese (Turkestan) 55 734 789 Afghan 50 547 597 South African 40 40 Bahrain i 26 26 Russian (Turkestan) 10 7 17 Chinese 17 17 Persian 32 10 42 Miscellaneous 124 124 Hejaz-Nejd, &amp;c. 428 43 471 782 1.341 2.123 120. Pilgrims of the above category were less by 1,970 than last year, when their number was 4,093. Of this decrease, Persians accounted for 968, Chinese (Turkestan) for 653, while other countries were responsible for the balance. 121. In addition to the pilgrims classified in the above tables, there was a small number of Indian pilgrims who came to the Hejaz via Iraq, Palestine and Suez. Also a good number of them came by overland routes via Nejd. Iraq and Yemen. The last mentioned pilgrims were almost all indigent and had to be eventually repatriated at the expense of the Government of India. 122. The following table shows the movement of return traffic. It should be noted that the Nemazi line ran only one steamer, the ' Sarvistan,' during the season. This vessel brought two shiploads of pilgrims to Jedda, but, after taking one complement of outgoing pilgrims back to India, did not return to Jedda for the remainder. This caused some difficulty, as the agents who represent both lines at Jedda had no authority to accommodate the outstanding balance of Nemazi Line pilgrims in the Mogul ships. An arrangement in this sense was eventually, however, arrived at between the two companies, greatly to the relief of the holders of Nemazi return tickets, who, as it was, suffered some delay and were in danger of being stranded.

The discrepancy between this figure and that g-iven in the general statistics in section (2) is accounted for by the fact that the figure in section (2) is based on official lists received from India, whereas the figure in the print table is derived from the steamship companies' lists, which do not include children. ( 2 ) The excess of outgoing over incoming pilgrims carried b}* the Mogul Line is due to the fact that they took back to India a number of holders of Nemazi return tickets (see paragraph 122) as well as the •destitutes repatriated at the end of the season, many of whom had come overland to the Hejaz. 124. The following table shows the distribution of the totals given in tihe preceding paragraph by ports of embarkation and destination The statement of arrivals at Bombay and Karachi cannot, however, be vouched for, owing to the fact that a certain number of pilgrims booked for Bombay prefer to land at Karachi rather than continue the sea voyage on to Bombay.

Apart from the difficulty over certain holders of Nemazi return tickets (see paragraph 122), there was no undue detention of returning Indian pilgrims. No pilgrim was kept waiting for more than the regulation period of twenty-five days, and no fines were therefore incurred by the shipping companies. Attention may, however, be drawn to the certain matters of detail, as follows, in connexion with the arrangements for returning pilgrims :— 128. Much anxiety was caused among pilgrims booked for return in the steamship 'Jehangir ' owing to the reluctance of the agents and/or owners to allow her departure when as many as 900 return ticket-holders, besides a numberof purchasers of fresh tickets, were ready to sail, ihere was, m the opinion of the Indian vice-consul, no plausible reason ior the delay, as anotxiei ship of the same line was also in harbour, and a third was on its ^ fi oni India. A considerable number of the waiting pilgrims, headed by one Syed Ahmed, a brother of Dr. Syed Mahmoud. secretary to the All-India Congress Committee, threatened a demonstration. The matter was adjusted at the instance of the Legation, although His Majesty's Minister has no legal power to control shipping in such matters. In the event, the Jehangir sailed three days earlier than the date at first proposed. The fact that she carried her full complement of pilgrims shows that there was no reasonable ground for holding her back 129. The growth in the number of well-to-do and educated pilgrims in proportion to the total number coming from India, has directed attention to tiu. insufficiency of first and second class accommodation for the return voyage. Pilgrims of this class are naturally eager to get back as soon as possible after the Haj. In some cases they are reduced to travelling on deck rather than wait, although they thereby sacrifice money as well as comfort, for the shipping companies allowed no refund. In three steamers of the Mogul Line, sailing in May 1931, fifty first and thirty-two second class ticket-holders travelled on deck, and five first class passengers travelled second class. The shortage of accommodation also creates a traffic in cabins reserved for the ships' officers, who make a personal profit by letting them to pilgrims desirous of greater space and comfort. This would not be open to any grave objection, if it were practised on a moderate scale and the extra charges were controlled. When, however, officers' accommodation is thus let to pilgrims on any considerable scale, it affects the comfort of all first and second class - passengers, as the officers who have vacated their own cabins are compelled to encroach on the saloon and deck accommodation intended for such passengers. It is alleged that in one case this year, every member of a ship's complement entitled to cabin room, from the master down to the clerks, let it to pilgrims at rates varying from 1,200 rupees to 400 rupees for the voyage from Jedda to India. His Majesty's Minister has drawn the attention of the Government of India to the matter in a separate despatch, in w r hich he dealt also with another and even more undesirable practice, whereby deck space reserved or said to be reserved for the use of members of the crew is divided off and let to deck passengers. 130. The shortage of accommodation for passengers of the better class increases the difficulty of dealing with conflicting claims on it. Pilgrims are tempted to bring various influences to bear in order to secure priority of departure, and in the past corrupt practices were common in the offices of the sihipping agents. The Indian vice-consul has, in recent years, been instrumental in establishing a system of rotation, under which passages are assigned, under the direction of the local Haj Committee, in the order of arrival at Jedda, with resort to ballot in the presence of the pilgrims themselves, in doubtful cases, e.g., to decide between the claims of pilgrims arriving simultaneously. This system has earned the commendation of pilgrims. Every effort is made to apply it strictly, without regard to the standing or influence of those seeking return accommodation, and, when it was first introduced, Munshi Ihsanullah risked Ibn Saud's displeasure by refusing to accord preferential treatment, even at the King s request. It has since been thought politic to allow some relaxation in favour of Royal guests, when the occasion arises. 131. The Indian vice-consul draws attention to a difficulty arising out of the fact that pilgrims taking return tickets at Calcutta are compelled to land at Bombay on their return, as the steamers go no further. First and second class passengers complained that they could not obtain a refund of the difference in fare from the agents in Jedda, who make the necessary refund to deck passengers in the vice-consul s presence, but professed to have no instructions to make it T • ^ 0 ther cases. The agents gave way and made the refunds on Munshi Ihsanullah s intervention, but he points out that it would obviate much trouble and uneasiness if the carrying companies could be induced to charge for the return voyage to Bombay only in the first instance, unless they can guarantee shipment to Calcutta. 132 Some difficulty arose at Jedda in 1931 in connexion with pilgrims who had come from India by way of Iraq, and had deposited money in India to cover possible quarantine charges and the like in the latter country. A good many of them, finding their resources depleted in the Hejaz, expected to be able31 HA a i' P T' h \ ( trf itS '^ q u eSti r at Jedda - From correspondence between tl ' f 11 Ma J est y' s High Commissioner at Bagdad, it emerged that the deposits could not be touched, but claims falling to' be met from them should be made later by the Iraq Government. In certain cases the Legation was compelled to advance pioney to enable the pilgrims concerned to proceed to India. In some they contrived to borrow the necessary money from otJiGr sources. 111 a cases pilgrims, who had come via Iraq, and had taken return tiekets for the homeward journey from Jedda to Beirut by steamer, and on to Bagdad by motor-car, remained in the Hejaz, and unsuccessfully sought a refund of the return fares. The transporting companies relied on the conditions printed on the combined tickets, which protected them against any obligation to make refunds m respect of unused coupons except in the case of sickness or death In view ot their refusal, it seemed doubtful whether the matter could usefully be pursued. Representations by Pilgrims. 134 In view of the attention which is now being given to pilgrimage matters generally in India, in connexion with the Haj Enquiry Committee's Reports, the following passages are reproduced textuallv from the Indian vice- consul's report on the 1931 pilgrimage ;—- '' ^ es ides many who made verbal complaints, the names of K.B. Abdul Latif Ha,ji Hayat Khan, M.L.C., Bombay, and K.B. M.I. Kader of Bombay, and one Syed Mehr Ali Shah, B.A., a respectable pilgrim from Sind, may be mentioned. These gentlemen in their memorandum, a joint one in the case of the first two, to the Legation have pointed out that: — ' (1) Steamer fares are still high, and, if possible, should be further reduced. ' (2) Accommodation for first and second-class pilgrims on board pilgrim steamers is inadequate to meet the demand, which is on the increase. Due to lack of the accommodation, many first- and second-class return ticket holders, of whom the detail is given hereafter, had perforce to travel as deck passengers Many had to pay excessive amounts to get officers' cabins. ' (3) The bath-rooms and w .c .'s provided for first- and second-class passengers, besides being inadequate to cater for requirements, were freely used by deck passengers as well as by ships' officers. The first-class lady passengers were the worst sufferers in this respect. ' (4) The second-class cabins are located in an ill-ventilated corner on the middle deck, and their condition is much worse than that of third-class passengers. '(5) The heavy luggage belonging to pilgrims which may not be wanted during the voyage should be kept in a store room. At present it is allowed to be placed on deck, to the great inconvenience of other passengers. ' (6) The supply of water, though copious, was not fit for consumption on the return journey, owing to its having been stored for over two months. It ' was found to have changed in colour and taste. Many of the passengers drinking this water suffered from diarrhoea and dysentery and other intestinal troubles.' &lt;c (7) Cooking spaces reserved on the upper deck were occupied by deck passengers, who put up curtains ' and thus prevented their being used for the purpose intended.' ' (8) The shipping companies are not keen to observe punctually the dates fixed for the sailing of steamers, which are changed often to the great anxiety of intending pilgrims. 1 ' (9) First and second-class passengers should have the privilege of having their berths reserved on the return journey beforehand by intimation to the authorities concerned, and to be allowed to land at Karachi to get their food supply, &amp;c. ' (10) Deck passengers cooked their food near the first-class cabins, to the p -reat inconvenience of the occupants of the cabins.32 ' (11) The space on the upper deck provided lor cooking purpose is not sufficient. The pilgrims, therefore, had to cook m turn. ' (12) 1 io'htino' arrangements were inadequate and unsatisfactory. ' (13) The shipping staff was generally careless and did not quite look to the comforts of the pilgrims. Pilgrims were packed to suffo cation and no room was left for them to offer their prayers This was due to the heavy luggage being allowed to remain on deck. ' (14) The ship's doctors in many cases charged fees from patients suffering from small-pox or chicken-pox, and, so to speak, usually carried on practice on board. ' In this connexion it may also be worth recording that on the Khedivial Mail Line ( Suez -Jedda -Suakin-Port Sudan), which has much smaller steamers than the Indian pilgrim steamers, first- and second -class cabins are much more decent and have separate saloons and decks, v hile there is no separate saloon or deck for second-class pilgrims on board Indian pilgrim steamers. Reports from first-class passengers to the eftect that officers did not allow them to use the saloon were not inirequent. Sir A. K. Ghaznavi, who had an opportunity during his recent visit to the Hejaz on pilgrimage to visit the steamers of other lines engaged in pilgrim traffic, was surprised to see the far superior conditions of the first- and second-class cabins on those steamers. He expressed it as his desire that similar arrangements and facilities should be provided on Indian steamers. || I ' The other great need, which has been pointed out in previous annual reports and which was also felt by Sir A. K. Ghaznavi, is for adequate arrangements for pilgrims landing from board ship. Ihe Khedivial Line steamers have four ladders—two on each side—for the purpose. The ladders, moreover, have strong wooden bars against the danger of falling into the sea while landing. It would be as well if similar arrangements could be provided on board Indian pilgrim steamers.' ' 135. In another passage in his report the Indian vice-consul deals with the vexed question of catering on board ship. He states that most pilgrims who take tickets inclusive of food complain vehemently. He deprecates the present system b y which the food is provided by a private concern independent of the shipping companies. He accuses the food supply company of discriminating in favour of influential pilgrims, in order to curry favour with them and enlist their support. Notwithstanding the favourable opinions expressed by certain pilgrims of this kind, e.g., Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif, Munshi Ihsanullah considers that the food supply company neglect the mass of pilgrims. He strongly advocates the introduction of a compulsory food system, and the adoption as a pendant thereto of measures to ensure the comfort and convenience of pilgrims in this respect, either by a reform of the present system or by arranging for the shipping companies to provide food for all passengers, as they at present do in the case of those travelling first and second class. In any case, he says, the arrangements should be under the supervision of the Amir-ul-Hujjaj, of each pilgrim ship, as suggested by the Haj Enquiry Committee. 136. In this connexion, Munshi Ihsanullah mentions an incident which occurred when the steamship 'Jehangir' was about to leave Jedda. Two second-class pilgrims complained to him after embarking that no cabin accom modation had been provided for them. It appeared on enquiry that the manager of the food supply company had been given gratis the use of one of the cabins shown in the ship's papers as being reserved for second-class passengers, and was unwilling to give it up. He was eventually compelled to vacate the cabin, but Munshi Ihsanullah reports the matters with the suggestion that accommodation other than that reserved for pilgrims should be provided for employees of the food supply company, or that, if pilgrims' cabins are used for the purpose, the ship s papers should be amended accordingly, in order to prevent encroachment on space intended for pilgrims. Registration. 137. Ihe arrangements for registering Indian pilgrims at the Indiai 1 section of the Legation on arrival have now been perfected, and have given Out of the 7.200 odd Indian pilgrims arriving eminentlv satisfactorv results.tttteklfhoZr 8 than 6,838 were registered - The remainder were 138 The registration system confers on pilgrims the advantage of bringing them mto personal contact with the Indian vice-consul and his staff, and therebv reducing en aidships and difficulties in the Hejaz. They escape the danger of losing-their return tickets during the Haj, as these are'deposited with the Indian section. Strict precautions are taken to prevent impostors from obtamino- possession ol the tickets when these are redistributed through the mutawwifs agents, who ar e required to sign for the tickets handed to them, and are held responsible 101 seeing that they are used only by the rightful owners 139. During the 1931 season, sixty Indian pilgrims lost their pilgrim passes bearing the registration endorsement of the Legation. Some of these passes were m due course presented by impostors. In a few cases it was found, as soon as the iightiul owneis piesented themselves, that tickets for which mutawwifs agents had signed had got into wrong hands, and the agents were called upon to make good the value. After this experience they learnt caution, and spared no pains to assure themselves of the genuineness of their clients. 140. The registration system also facilitates the return to India of unclaimed letum tickets; 155 such tickets, dating from 1929, were forwarded to the Government of India this year. It appears that there is some technical difficulty in India in obtaining a refund of the value of such tickets from the shipping companies, but it is at least satisfactory to know that they can no longer go astray or be misappropriated. 141. Registration not being compulsory, it still happens that return tickets are not deposited at the Legation. The large percentage of registrations now recorded shows, however, the success achieved by the Indian vice-consul in counteracting the inclination of evil-minded mutawwifs to prevent their pilgrims from coming into contact with the Legation, and to impress upon the mutawwifs' agents in Jedda the importance of ensuring the registration of all Indian pilgrims in their charge. In 1931 three out of the small number of pilgrims who had failed to deposit their return tickets, lost them. The shipping companies were duly warned, and the owners of the tickets were provided with emergency passes to enable them to return to India. Local Haj Committee. 142. This committee was again duly constituted in 1931 and did useful work in connexion with the distribution of passages to out-going pilgrims. The nature and scope of this committee, an unofficial body with strictly limited functions, have been described minutely in one of the recent despatches from Jedda (see paragraph 18) dealing with the conclusions of the Haj Enquiry Committee. The Government of India has also been approached on the question of providing a suitable representation allowance for the Indian vice-consul, at whose house the committee meets, and who has for some years past been put to considerable expense through the necessity of extending hospitality to the committee as well as in other directions of a similar kind. Destitutes. 143. The number of destitute Indian pilgrims who had to be repatriated at the expense of the Government of India in 1931 was 318, a figure which, having regard to the diminished size of the pilgrimage, compares unfavourably with that of 387 in 1930. Passage money at the high destitute rate of 40 rupees a head was collected from seven of the 318, and one was a State pensioner. The remaining 310 were completely destitute. The expense entailed on the Govern ment of India was R. 13 ,239 .3.8. The usual difficulties were experienced at the Legation, which had to deal with a mob of over 400 applicants, and to weed out persons having no claim on the Government of India, i.e., Afghans and those from beyond the borders of Baluchistan, whom it is most difficult to distinguish from British Indian subjects of frontier origin. By arrangement with the Government of India, it was decided this year [a) to transmit to the leading authorities in India by the master of the carrying ship lists showing the names and alleged addresses of the repatriated destitutes, with a view to their being traced on arrival and called upon, if possible, to refund the money expended on [62741 f''4 fj, i their behalf; and (h) to obtain from each destitute an undertaking to repay the ■cost of repatriation on demand. . . 144. The difficulties of the Legation were increased tins year by the unwillingness of Messrs. Turner. Murrison and Co., who iio^v have a virtual monopoly of the return pilgrim traffic to India, to quote a moderate rate. Their agents at first stood out for 50 rupees a head, oi only 20 mpees less than the ordinary single fare of 70 rupees. ! his made it impossible, pending consulta tion with India, to ship the destitutes as intended m the steahiship Alavi. The authorities in India eventually got the company to agree to a late of 40 rupees, and the destitutes were repatriated in a later vessel. It may be noted that the agents had already conceded the rate of 40 rupees to the llejazi (lovernment for the repatriation of 60 Bokhari destitutes shipped in the Alavi. 145. The problem of the destitute Indian pilgrim was discussed at length in paragraphs 25 ff. of the report for 1930. Its growing importance appears from the following table showing the number of pilgrims repatriated at Government expense during the last five years and tiie rcttes charged ; Year 1927 1928 1929 1930 1931 Total Indian pilgrims. 26,500 14.000 15,000 11.000 7,276 Destitutes repatriated. 188 179 139 387 318 Rate per head. Rupees. 15.8.0 13.8.0 25.0.0 35.0.0 40.0.0 146. The following table shows, for the 310 completely destitute pilgrims repatriated in 1931. (a) the provinces of origin and (b) the routes by which the pilgrims reached the Hejaz :— (a) Province of Origin— Sind Bengal ... Punjab ... Malabar Baluchistan North-West Frontier Hyderabad (Deccan) Other provinces ... 91 75 62 32 31 10 3 6 (b) Routes of Access— Overland— Via Muscat, Bahrein, Goadar, Basra, Koweit, Nejd Via Mokalla, Aden, Yemen Via Bagdad and Syria By Sea— Single ticket holders from Bombay and Karachi Return ticket holders from Bombay and Karachi who obtained refunds 84 10 310 120 68 28 216 94 310 147. Several passes showed that the authorities at Goadar had either issued .a certificate of identity or endorsed passes to enable pilgrims to land at different ports of the Arabian coast. Ten of those who came via Bagdad and Syria had obtained permanent passports at Bagdad and then travelled overland on foot. The figures as a whole show how greatly the increase in the number of destitutes is due (a) to the large number of pilgrims who find their way to the Hejaz by overland routes and (b) to abuse of the facilities given in India for travelling byIW 35 sea with siiiglc tickets, taken in the off-season or, during the season on a declaration of non-intention to return to India. 148. The Legation in Jedda does its utmost to reduce the annual expense to the Government of India under this head, by assuring itself that applicants are really destitute and are, in fact, British Indian subjects. It cannot be too often repeated, however, that the key to the situation lies with the authorities in India and that a serious reduction in the growing number of destitutes can only be effected by the exercise of strict control at all seasons on the land frontier and at minor ports of embarkation and by a considerable tightening up of the arrangements under which pilgrims are allowed to take single tickets for the sea voyage from the regular pilgrim ports. The Indian vice-consul makes the following specific suggestions, which are reproduced textually at the risk of labouring the points made in last year's report : — (a) 1 he authorities in Karachi and Calcutta should be instructed to put a stop to the menacing increase of single ticket holders, who hail particularly from these two ports, merely making a declaration of non-return to India within three years. Pending modifications in existing rules by the Government of India, they should strictly follow the policy of the Bombay authorities and observe a more restrictive attitude in the matter of allowing pilgrims to come to the Hejaz with single tickets only. (&amp;) The existing system of obtaining pilgrim passes from the Protector of Pilgrims at Karachi and Bombay should be discontinued, and the intending pilgrims should apply for their passes to their respective district officers. It would put a stop to the evil machinations of the pilgrim brokers in fetching pilgTims to ports other than their own. deceiving them in many ways which ultimately give rise to various complaints in the Hejaz. ' (c) The shipping companies engaged in pilgrimage traffic should be made to repatriate free of charge a certain proportion of the total pilgrims carried. The companies would suffer no financial loss if they adopted this scheme, in view of the fact that their ships have to go back to India, whether there is any sufficient number of pilgrims on board or not. ' (d) The last, though not the least, is to amend the existing regulations, which enable pilgrims to claim refunds of their return passage money on the expiry of one year, and to extend this period to two years, with reservations for the Indian vice-consul to use his discretion in cases w T here he deems it proper to prolong it for a further two years, thereby making the ticket valid for four years.' 149. His Majesty's Minister is in general agreement with Munshi Ihsanullah's suggestions, subject to a doubt under head (c), as to whether shipping companies can be expected, especially in the present depressed conditions, to repatriate any important number of destitutes free of charge. Sir A. Ryan considers that a reasonable rate for eventual destitutes up to a suitable number or percentage should be agreed in India early in the season. He trusts that, in the course of the present examination of the conclusions of the Haj Enquiry Committee, special attention may be given to the connected problems of la) reducing the number of potential destitutes by restrictive action in India and (b) facilitating the task of the Legation in disposing of such destitutes as may have to be repatriated at the end of the season despite all precautions which can be taken to reduce their number Forged Indian Currency Notes. 150. See paragraph 18 of section (1). Publicity. 151. Attention is directed to the points enumerated in paragraph 86 of the report for 1930 regarding matters which might usefully be brought to the notice of intending pilgrims in pamphlets, &amp;c., published in India for their guidance. During the period now under review His Majesty's Minister suggested to the Government of India definite arrangements for affixing sign boards to the various offices, &amp;c., in the Hejaz when the Indian vice-consul and doctor attest to the lequirements of pilgrims, in accordance with the recommendations made in the Haj Enquiry Committee's confidential report. [6274] 1 F 2 f* u : 1 :36 Bankin a Facilities. 152. The lack of adequate banking facilities in the Holy Places is increasingly felt. Owing to their absence, pilgrims still make considerable use of hundis or drafts issued by commercial houses in India, on their correspondents in Jedda and Mecca. The difficulty of cashing these hundis was greatly aggravated in 1931 owing to the precarious position in which many local merchants found themselves as a result of the general economic stress and instability. Fn many cases it required the intervention of the Indian vice-consul to ensure the payment of hundis, and pilgrims suffered further hardship owing to exchange fluctuations. A certain use is made by pilgrims of Cook s circular drafts, which are obtainable at the Indian ports of embarkation. These, however, can only be cashed in the regular way at Jedda, and in present circumstances they are difficult to realise at Mecca and Medina, where pilgrims encountered great difficulty this year in consequence. On several occasions the Indian vice-consul was compelled to bring drafts of this kind from Mecca to Jedda to be cashed, at the request of Indian pilgrims. 153. His Majesty's Minister has dealt with the whole subject more fully in his despatches dealing with the Haj Enquiry Committee's reports. He deprecates a suggestion made to the Hyderabad Government by the leader of the pilgrimage from that State, who had considerable difficulty in cashing hundis in 1931, that arrangements should be made to remit funds through the Legation. It appears to him undesirable that the Legation should be involved in business of this kind when so many other pilgrimage matters have to be dealt with under great pressure. The real cure would appear to lie in a development of modern banking facilities. Pilgrimage Staff. 154. The work of the Indian Section was carried out during the 1931 season under the direction of Munshi Ihsanullah with two assistants. One of the latter, Mr. Syed Nur Hussein Shah, fell seriously ill about two months before the Haj and had to return to India. He was replaced temporarily by a third clerk, Haji Mohammed Sharif, who only arrived by the last pilgrim steamer from India, but did good work during the remainder of the season. His knowledge of trans frontier people and things was of special value, e.g., in the handling of the destitutes. The dislocation of the arrangements caused by Nur Hussein Shah's illness imposed a considerable burden on his permanent colleague, Mr. Shah Jehan Kabir, who worked with commendable zeal and ability throughout the season. 155. In his despatches on the Haj Enquiry Committee's reports (see paragraph 19) His Majesty's Minister has submitted to the Government of India considered proposals for a reorganisation of the statt of the Indian Section on the basis of employing three permanent clerks with properly graded rates of pay in addition to the Indian vice-consul, future increases to be supplied, if possible, from established Indian services. Such a strengthening of the permanent staff would enable the increasing work of the section to be performed with greater efficiency. It would also reduce somewhat the need for temporary staff during the busy season, for which purpose the Government of India has in recent years sanctioned special expenditure not exceeding £200 each year. Pilgrimage Tariff and Estimated Cost of the Pilgrimage. 156. The subject of the authorised tariff of charges for pilgrims is dealt with this year in the section on mutawwifs (see paragraphs 97 ff. above). A tentative estimate by the Indian vice-consul of the probable inclusive cost of the pilgrimage to an average Indian pilgrim in 1932 is given in Appendix C. This estimate was frefared before the sterling crisis of the autumn of 1931, and does not take into account the 'possible repercussions on the monetary situation India and the Hejaz, as to which no precise information is available at the time .of writing. (10) Afghan Pilgrimage. 157. Five hundred and ninety-seven Afghan pilgrims came on Haj through Indian ports. The majority travelled on return tickets. Twenty-three of themI mmm mm if HJ . 0 v 1 37 based on the reports submitted by the Malay pilgrimage officer, Haji Abdul Majid (paragraphs 162 to 184) and Captain B. W. Seager (paragraphs 185 to 206). It has been thought well to reproduce the reports with little more than verbal alterations, even at the risk of some slight overlapping with previous sections of the present report as a whole. €4%* ' lost then tickets w nile m the Mejaz and were given such assistance as possible by the Indian Section of the Legation, emergency certificates being issued to enable them to secure return passages from the shipping companies concerned. The Afghan pilgrims generally were treated on the same footing as Indians m such matters as the provision of return passages, &amp;c. 158. After the pilgrimage there were about 160 Afghan destitutes who had come to the Hejaz with single tickets by sea or overland on foot. In the past the Hejazi Government have assisted such persons to return. This assistance was withheld in 1931 owing to the impoverishment of the Government and perhaps to the fact that they had undertaken the repatriation of a considerable number of Javanese pilgrims (see paragraph 14). It is suggested that in conditions of financial stress they preferred to show their favour to pilgrims who, like the Dutch East Indians, are, in the mass, remunerative, rather than to Afghans, none of whom bring much grist to the Hejazi mill. Anyhow, despite appeals made on their behalf to the King by influential members of the local community, the Afghan destitutes remained stranded in the Hejaz in conditions of great misery and many returned from Jedda to Mecca and Medina in the hope of living on charity. 159. Reference has been made in paragraph 15 to the participation in this year's Haj of Amanullah Khan and many Afghan notables, including supporters of the ex-King and representatives of the present Afghan Government. 160. The Turkish representative in Jedda would appear to be no longer in charge of Afghan interests as the arrangement in this sense made in the time of King Amanullah has not been renewed since the accession of the present King of Afghanistan; in consequence of this the Turkish Legation again refrained from appointing a representative on the local Haj Committee this year. The question of Afghan representation in the Hejaz is stated to have been discussed with Ibn Saud by the official delegates from Kabul who came on Haj. The Kathiawar Afghan, Moulana Soofi Muhiuddin, mentioned in paragraph 15, also interested himself in the matter and appears to be responsible for a suggestion, which has not, however, got beyond the stage of indeterminate soundings, that the British Indian vice-consul should be placed in charge of Afghan interests. The question of Afghan representation is of importance in connexion with the problem of the destitutes mentioned above. 161. The following sections, dealing with other categories of pilgrims, are ' I i!. i I ■ I r : : f (11) Malay Pilgrimage. Shipping. 162. The first pilgrim ship during the season under review left Singapore on the 11th November and arrived at Jedda on the 28th November. Seven other pilgrim ships followed, the last one arriving at Jedda on the 11th April. All eight ships were of the Blue Funnel Line Number of Pilgrims. ...... r, |jW 163. The total number of pilgrims of all nationalities, including mtants, yecd embarked at each of the two Straits Settlements ports were as follows Singapore Penang Total 1,489 361 1,850 The figure for last year was 6,333. Port Swettenham, in the Federated Malay States, though declared in November last as a port of embarkation for pilgrims, was apparently still not utilised as.such during the 1931 season.33 18 16 9 19 t 3 65 30 11 32 9 5 21 7 1 16 6 1 32 8 7 22 20 8 26 18 10 4 5 1 3 1 110 137 57 ISlumher of Malay Pilgrims. 164. The number of registered Malay pilgrims from each colony or State in Malaya was as follows ;— Children Straits Settlements— Mate. Females, under 12. Singapore ... ••• Penang (including Province Wellesly and the Bindings) Malacca Federated Malay States— Perak Selangor Pahang Negri Sembilan ... Unfederated Malay States— Johore ... Kedah ... Kelantan Trengganu Brunei ... Total Grand total: 506. This figure includes six Malay pilgrims who came on pilgrimage via India. 165. The figures for the last three seasons were as follows ; — Season 1927-28 ... ... ... 4,418 Season 1928-29 ... ... ... 1,455 Season 1929-30 ... ... ... 2.590 The conspicuously small number of Malay pilgrims during the season was no doubt due mainly to the world-wide trade depression that perhaps hits Malaya the hardest owing to her dependence on only two principal industries, tin-mining and rubber-planting. Pilgrim Passes. 166. Certain centres issuing pilgrim passes, viz., Kemaman, Klang. jRembau, Johore Bahru, Sarawak, Kuala Lipis, and Temerloh, still omitted to state {a) names of pilgrims, and (h) the names of 'accompanying relatives'' in the Jawi (Arabic) character. Other centres, on the other hand, gave other details unnecessarily v/ritten in Jawi. The main point for purposes of identification by the Hejazi authorities is to have the two above-mentioned headings filled in in Jawi (Arabic) letters as well as in English. y accination and Inoculation. 16/. The practice evidently adopted in the Straits Settlements of leaving these preventive measures to be attended to by private practitioners seems to my mind to be irreproachable only if the practitioners will certify that the pilgrim is successfully vaccinated and inoculated, instead of merely vaccinated and inoculated, as I find has been the practice in some of these certificates. The difference between the two is too apparent to need further comment. The Feeding System. 168. Haji Abdul Majid expresses regret that in spite of his memorandum ot last year urging improvement in this respect, no attempt was made to see that the food was prepared in a better way. Raja Haji Othman, the Chief Kathi of ►_eJangor and a son-in-law of the ruler of that State, expressed to him great sin prise at the unsatisfactory mode of cooking food in vogue on board the pilgrim ship by which he travelled to Jedda. He remarked that he could not understand why the Feaerated Malay States Malay police recruits, who paid less for theirrl 39 food in the training depot, got better food m every respect than the pilgrims who paid more. lie added that he couid easily get contractors who would supply superior and better cooked food for the amount now collected from the pilonms on this account He also deplored the fact that unwanted heavy lug-p'ao'e of pilgrims was still strewn on the decks. Stowaways. 169. There were several cases of stowaways who were discovered after their landing in Jedda. Ihey were taken back to Malaya, if found before disembarka tion at Jedda, but were allowed by the Hejazi Government to perform their Hai before they were surrendered to the shipping company for repatriation. Sheikh's 6&gt;r Mutawwif s Fees. ilgrims for the various items to the: £ Rials. 1/0. The fees paid by pilgrims for the various items to their sheikhs during the season were as follows :&gt;— (1) Boat-hire for each pilgrim with his luggage, cartage of luggage, house-rent in Jedda and municipality dues ... ... ... 2 (2) Car-hire for each pilgrim, Jedda to Mecca. (No pilgrim was allowed to travel here by camel) ^ ... ... ... ... ... 8 -10 (3) Camel-hire for luggage to Mecca ... ... 1 (4) ' Duit Jamu,' i.e., house-rent in Mecca, food and accommodation at Arafat and Muna, and Government tax ... ... ... 8 (5) Car-hire.

(This rate advances with the season) ... ... 9-12 (6) Camel-hire, Mecca-Medina and back ... 7 (7) Car or camel-hire, Mecca-Jedda with luggage ... ... ... ... ... 171 (8) Payment in Jedda. as per items in (1) ... ... 2 Total ... ... ... ... 28 31i Its equivalent roughly in Straits dollars is 270. 171. A slight increase in the Hejazi Government taxes on pilgrims, particularly at (4) above, raised the total for these payments from the total shown in previous years. These figures should form a basis for the estimate of expenses by would-be pilgrims during the coming season. General Conditions during the whole Pilgrimage. 172. There was no difficulty experienced by pilgrims on account of exorbitant prices of food-stuffs and water, as sometimes happened in the past, but the temporary fall in the market value of the local Government currency, i.e., the qurush and halalas, during the Haj week was a source of some anxiety to the pilgrims, as each day brought news of a fresh decline in the purchasing value of their money. 173. The peace and security to life and property, so highly spoken of in the past, remained practically the same throughout the season, though signs were not wanting that the poverty-stricken Bedouin camel-owners, through the use of the more favoured motor vehicles, would revert to their former life of stealing and robbing whenever or wherever they could. Pilgrims, therefore, would be well advised not to be implicitly trustful of these Bedouin in future. 174. During the Haj days, the Hejazi medical authorities had on the route between Mecca and Arafat more hospital tents and water-tanks provided for the use of pilgrims than in previous years. Traffic arrangements as well as climatic conditions, were also better, so that with the comparatively small number of pilgrims of all nationalities congregated, no great hardship was experienced at Arafat and at Muna as in the past. 175. The Hejazi Government's regulation under which, in order to protect local traders, pilgrims who have stayed for more than one season in the Hejaz should be guaranteed by some responsible person against possible liabilities ■o IOO !■Ill 11 I— A £ « before they are allowed to leave the country, is considered by one and all to be ueiuje mcy aic anu as the procedure tor ettectmp- this unnecessary and vexatious, the more 80 1 ab .

Pilgrims who used to depend on their sheikhs to stand guarantee for them are ^ . 7. n rpfuse to do so for the plausible reason that the apt now to find that the sheikhs re±use to &lt;10 s p ^ the i T traders seldom, if ever, reter to tnem oeioxe u r - 1 v j 176 The use of cars for journey to Arafat and Mina which was allowed last season was stopped this season, except among a few favourites of the King, A ssistance to Pilgrims. 177. The annual allowance of £25 for the assistance oi Malay destitutes was raised to £100 so as to meet the needs of the large number ol applicants to this fund, due to the stringent conditions prevailing m Malaya as well as m the Heiaz Out of forty applications received, seventeen were approved, and a sum of '£100 was distributed as loans which should be in most cases recoverable.. Thou oil it could be considered a good check agai nst the tendency among pilgrims, to look upon the sheikhs or mutawwifin as their sole benefactors m the Hejaz, precautions were nevertheless taken so as not to encourage this form 01 assistance'| by the Government in future. Sugaestions by the Dato Verdana Mentri of Kelantan. 178. Amongst many other things, the Dato' Perdana Mentri of Kelantan, Nik Mahmud, O.B.E., who came on pilgrimage during the previous season, made the suggestion that every pilgrim before leaving Malaya should deposit with the Government the necessary amount, to meet all (lues and payments 111 the Hejaz, so as not to be a burden financially on the sheikhs or mutawwifin. In spite of all that has been said against the sheikhs, it cannot be denied that as a class, particularly those of Malay origin, they have been helpful to destitute pilgrims in the past. Indeed, the notorious rapacity of these people, so much deplored nowadays, has been due principally to the necessity of making up for losses on account' of bad debts among pilgrims. Whilst agreeing with the Date' on the main principles of his recommendation, it is felt that if the Malay Pilgrimage Officer were to be in charge of the deposited funds and pay them out as they were due according to the Date's scheme, there would be too much Government interference in the freedom of the pilgrims in such a personal and religious affair as the pilgrimage. Haji Abdul Majid recalls a previous suggestion of his that wide circulation should be given in Malaya to the estimate of expense likely to be incurred by would-be pilgrims, and adds that the sheikhs or mutawwifin concerned have been warned unofficially that all promissory notes and such like documents should be legalised at the British Legation, so as to ensure the validity of their claims. Provision of Passage for the Return Journey. 179. Four ships carried back the pilgrims to Malaya, the first leaving Jedda on the 8th May and the last on the 12th June. As usual, those who had no pilgrim passes for this journey, who numbered fifty-two, used emergency passes issued by the British Legation. The new arrangement that pilgrims are allowed to take the holy Zemzem water on board the pilgrim ships with them for distribution among friends at home was a, satisfactory one. The System for the Issue and Ref und of Tickets. 180. This somewhat thorny question, which had been under discussion during the last three or four years, was summarily decided in effect by the Govern ment of the Straits Settlements, with the concurrence of the Singapore agents of the Blue Funnel Line, as follows : — (1) Pilgrims normally shall purchase return tickets. (2) Single tickets may be issued to Hejazi or Arabian nationals generally on the recommendation of the Mohammetan Advisory Board or the passport officer. C 1 ) The regulations here referred to are of general application, but they specially affect Mala} pilgrims, wh(5, like the Javanese, not infrequently stay more than one season. ' His Majesty's Minister- has drawn the attention of the Hejazi Government orally to the hardship entailed.41 Hi I; (3) Malays and persons domiciled in Malaya may be given single tickets on the recommendation of the passport officer, who shall satisfy himself, first, that such persons are of sufficient financial status to guarantee that they will not become destitute in the Hejaz; and secondly, that they intend to remain for the purpose of study in the Hejaz for not less than two years after having performed the Haj. (4) Eeturn ticket-holders, at the end of two seasons in the Hejaz, may be given either (a) a refund on their unused ticket at the rate of 30 per cent, of the face value of the return ticket and on the recommendation of the Malay Pilgrimage Officer or the British Legation, or {h) an extension for a further period of three years to the validity of their tickets, making five years in all. Number of Deceased Pilgrims. 181. The total number of deceased pilgrims amongst those who came this season, as reported by the deceased's next-of-kin to the Malay Pilgrimage Officer up to the time he left Jedda on the 12th June was seventeen, made up as follows:-— Straits Settlements— Singapore ... ... ... ... 2 Penang (including Province Wellesly and the Bindings) ... ... ... ... 1 Malacca ... ... ... ... 1 Federated Malay States— Perak ... Selangor Pahang Negri Sembilan ... Unfederated Malay States— Johore Kedah ... Kelantan Trengganu Brunei ... Total 17 This total works out at 3 -4 per cent., which is a decidedly better death rate than in all the previous years, owing to the better climatic and other conditions mentioned above. Effects of Deceased Pilgrims. 182. Practically all enquiries for effects of deceased pilgrims were success fully followed up with a view to the effects being distributed amongst deceased's next-of-kin through the usual channel. Effects of deceased pilgrims who died during this season without accompanying relatives should be handed over to the British Legation during the course of next season. Recommendations. 183. Haji Abdul Majid makes the following suggestions {a) The list of tariffs in the Hejaz during the past and coming year should be posted in the offices issuing pilgrim passes throughout Malaya. A margin for possible increases should, nevertheless, be made. Pilgrims are to be warned against making these payments in advance. The qualitv of food to be supplied on board pilgrim ships should be gone into bv a committee. ^ vy x X C- X x i- L vy k/ V C \ j v ^ v / axj - xxa - i . ^ (c) Pilgrims should be told to keep only such luggage as contain necessary clothing during the voyage on deck; heavy and unwanted luggage to. be put in ship's hold. ■ ^ ^ • • {cl) Medical practitioners should be asked to certify that the vaccination and inoculation are successfully done. &gt;6274; G4:2 ie) As students in Mecca generally cannot say definitely beforehand how lone they will remain in the Hejaz, there icing many factors to determine such a decision, it is felt that it would he a more satis- factory arransrement if the validity of all return tickets ^eie extended to five years and that a refund should be made m the event of the holders still remaining in the Hejaz, only after the expiration of this total period of validity. Staff. 184. Haii Abdul Majid. who had been seconded from the Federated Malay States Educational Department, to act as Malay Pilgrimage Officei since 1924, was confirmed in the post of the 1st January, 1931. Haji Mohammad Jamil, as clerk to the Malay Pilgrimage Officer, was satisfactory in many ways. (12) West A frican Pilgrimage. 185. Statistics issued by the local quarantine authorities show that 1,558 West African pilgrims, or ' Takrunis,' arrived in Jedda on pilgrimage this year via Suakin, as against the official figure of 3,525 for last year. It is, however, again evident that a considerable number—probably w 7 ell over a thousand— travelled by sambuq (dhow) from Massawa in spite of the Italian undertaking to the contrary, and landed at the smaller Hejazi ports south of Jedda such as Lith and Qunfida, in order to avoid payment of the Jedda quarantine dues. 186. During the return half of the season it was reported that this class of pilgrim had had the greatest difficulty in going back over the Massawa route. The inland desert track between Mecca and Qunfida and Mecca and Lith, which perforce has to be followed before proceeding across the Red Sea in sambuqs, was said to be unsafe owing to the raging of a series of sandstorms. This caused a number of caravans, which had set out from Mecca, to return and await better weather. Those pilgrim caravans w T hich had managed to reach the Red Sea littoral eventually took passage for Massawa m sambuqs, but were reported to have been turned back by the Eritrean authorities owing to their inability to meet the quarantine dues. On their return to the Hejaz, these unfortunates set out on foot again for Mecca and passed the word round that the Massawa route was closed to those with limited means, which effectively checked the departure of those pilgrims who had been held up owing to the inclement weather. 187. At the time of writing it is estimated that there are any number of British West African pilgrims up to a thousand in the Hejaz who are unable to get away owing to the reported impracticability of the desert-cum-sambuq route and to the lack of funds to return via Suakin. The question of their repatriation at Government expense is complicated by the congested state of the labour market in the Sudan, through which country they normally work their way homewards at their leisure. 188. A visit paid to Jedda in the spring by Major D. S. B. Thomson, Commissioner at Port Sudan, provided an opportunity of further discussion of the proposed scheme for the better organisation of the pilgrimage from Nigeria. This led to an agreement between the Sudan authorities and His Majesty 's Legation on proposals which it was hoped would meet as far as possible the wishes of the Nigerian Government without creating undue difficulty in the Sudan and at Jedda. It is hoped that a working agreement between all the authorities concerned will be reached in the near future. It will take time to make the proposed arrangements fully operative, but they should eventually ensure the use of the Suakin-Jedda steamer route, with return tickets, by the bulk of the Nigerian pilgrims and kill the sambuq traffic from Massawa with its attendant inconveniences. (13) Somali Pilgrimage. 189. The Hejaz quarantine authorities report that 103 British Somali pilgrims entered the port of Jedda by steamship and sambuq (dhow) this year. This figure in no way represents the total number of Somalis who came on pilgrimage. Apart from those pilgrims who entered the Hejaz through the port43 of Jed da, tiieie aie otheis, and doubtless they are the most numerous, who leave British k omaliland poi ts for Aden and Sheikh Sa id, or Mocha or jVIayun and reach the Hejaz through the Yemen. 190. ihe pilgrims, whose means are limited and who proceed by the Aden route, usually set out for the Holy Land on foot until they reach Hodeida in the Yemen. Ihe following is one of the many routes followed : Aden-Lahej- Subeyhi - Mawiya - Tess - Rumeyda - Matruba - Haiss - Jeraha - Zebi - Beyt- al-Fagi-Hodeida overland, and thence by sambuq to the Hejazi ports of Lith or Qunfida, w here they land and proceed on foot to Mecca; a few of them only being carried on as far as Jedda. 191. The pilgrims who come by Sheikh Sa'id, where they can land if they so wish and proceed on foot to Haiss in the Yemen, generally continue up the coast in sambuqs and land at Mocha (Yemen), whence they join up with the Aden and Mayun contingents at Haiss, on the Hodeida route, in the Tihama. 192. Those pilgrims who leave Somaliland ports for Mocha direct, if the wind be favourable, proceed thence on foot to the Holy Land and join up with the Aden, Sheikh Sa id and Mayun contingents at Haiss. From Haiss they proceed to Hodeida following the route described in paragraph 6 above. 193. I he pilgrims, who proceed from Somaliland to Mayun, and from thence on foot if they so wish along the coast to Haiss in the Yemen, generally continue the journey by sambuq to Mocha via Sheikh Sa'id. They, too, join up with the other pilgrim caravans at Haiss. 194. It will be seen that it is well nigh impossible to estimate the total number of Somalis who annually come on pilgrimage as, unless they are sick and destitute after their perilous and arduous journey overland, few are seen in Jedda. The hardier pilgrims with funds return home the same way and are not seen, whilst the destitutes seek out the British Legation at Jedda and apply for repatriation. 195. The disposal of Somali destitutes after the pilgrimage is a thorny problem. Most of them are without travel documents or any identity papers, and from time to time mistakes in identity are not unlikely to occur. The expenditure incurred on the repatriation of these Somali destitutes is not very considerable, but there are added complications owing to the fact that a number of them die on the return journey, which naturally increases the difficulty of obtaining refunds of moneys expended by the Legation on their behalf. 196. A special study is being made of the Somali pilgrimage, and it is hoped in due course to make certain recommendations to the Government of British Somaliland for the future welfare of their nationals. 197. A total of twenty-five destitute Somali pilgrims have been repatriated this year up to the time of writing. (14) Sudan Pilgrimage. 198. The Hejazi quarantine authorities report that 588 Sudanese pilgrims were carried by Khedivial steamers to the Hejaz from Suakin this year, a decrease of 477 on last year's figure, which was 1.065. 199. All Sudanese pilgrims who held pilgrim passports and return tickets returned to the Sudan on the conclusion of the pilgrimage. Those who had lost their travel documents on Haj were provided with emergency certificates by the Legation, whilst Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), the local agents of the Khedivial Mail Line, were good enough, as usual, to grant free passages to those pilgrims who were able to satisfy them that they had actually left the Sudan on pilgrimage and had possessed return tickets at the outset. 200. Three Sudani pilgrims are reported to have died on pilgrimage this year. ^ t (15) Palestinian and Transjordanian Pilgrimage. 201. The number of Palestinian and Transjordanian pilgrims to whom pilgrim passes were issued by the authorities in Palestine and Transjordan this year is reported by them to have been 447, an increase of sixty-four on last year s %ure. All these pilgrims travelled via Egypt and performed the sea journey to the Hejaz in steamers of the Khedivial Mail Line.

The member of the staff of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited) who acts as Acting Sarawak Pilgrimage Officer reported that all had left the Hejaz safely, eleven in the steamship 'Adrastus' and fourteen m the steamship ' Dardenus.' Short Explanation of some Terms frequently used in Connexion with the Pilgrimage. Alim (pi. ulama).—A learned man. The term usually includes Imams, Muftis, Qadhis and Maulawis. (Hughes.) Arafat. —The 'Hill of Recognition,' set in a wide plain VI miles from Mecca, where pilgrims gather on the ninth day of the month of pilgrimage, Dim 1 Wijja. ' The Holy Hill owes its name to the following legend : When our first parents forfeited Heaven for eating wheat, which deprived them of their primeval purity, they were cast down upon earth. The serpent descended upon Ispahan, the peacock at Kabul, Satan at Bilbays, Eve upon Arafat, and Adam at Ceylon. The latter, determining to seek his wife, began a journey to which the earth owes its present mottled appearance. Wherever our first father placed his foot, which was large, a town afterwards arose, and between the strides will always be country. Wandering for many years, he came to the Mountain of Mercy, where our common mother was continually calling upon his name, and recognition of each other gave the place the name of Arafat.' (Burton.) Haram. —' That which is sacred.' A name given to the precincts of Mecca and Medina, but more often and more particularly to the immediate precincts of the Holy Cube, or Kaba, at Mecca. Haj (lit. ' setting out ').—-The fifth pillar of Islam—Pilgrimage. And proclaim to the peoples a Haj. Let them come to thee on foot and on every fleet camel, arriving by every deep defile; ' That they may bear witness of its benefits to them, and may make mention of Allah's name on the appointed days, over the brute beasts with which he has supplied them for sustenance; Therefore eat thereof yourselves, and feed the needy, the poor; ' Then let them bring the neglect of their persons to a close, and let them pay their vows, and circuit the ancient House. i ' This do. And he that respecteth the sacred ordinances of Allah, this will be best for him with his Lord.' (Koran XXII, 28.) Hanafi. —A sect of the Sunnis founded bv the Imam Abu Hanifa and found in Turkey, Central Asia and Northern India (see Sunni). Appendix A.-to Hundi. An old-fashioned form of draft drawn by merchants in India on their agents or clients or correspondents elsewhere. An insignificant commission, • at much less than a bank rate, is generally charged, but there is no charge on Hundis for the Holy Places. Koshan. —A Persian word come to Arabia via Turkish, and now meaning the tax payable for the privilege of travelling by camel or car to Mecca or Medina. Mina (lit. ' a wish '), frequently transliterated Muna, which form, though apparently less correct, is retained temporarily in the body of the report for the sake of uniformity.—The sacred valley near Mecca, so called because Adam there wished for paradise. Here the pilgrims spend the 10th, 11th and 12th days of the month of pilgrimage to stone the three devils and to slaughter a sheep or a goat or a camel or a cow, according to their means. These 14 days of flesh -drying ' terminate the pilgrimage and provide food for the return journey. Mutaivwif (pi. mutawwifin).—The obligatory pilgrim guide, so called because he leads the ceremony of '' tawaf '' or seven-times circumambulation of the Kaba. From the execution of this simple religious duty his scope has so increased that he now controls every movement of his clients while on pilgrimage, and gains thereby his yearly livelihood (see Taqrir). Naqaba (lit. ''syndicate '').—The official organisation which allots clients to the motor-car companies competing in the pilgrim traffic. Shafti. —A sect of the Sunnis founded by the Imam Muhammad-bin-Idris- ash-Shafi'i and found in Egypt and South India (see Sunni). Shia (lit. ' followers —The followers of Ali, first cousin of the Prophet and husband of his daughter, Fatima. The Sunni Moslems call them the forsakers of the Truth,' i.e., the Dissenters of Islam. The Shia, on the contrary, strenuously maintain that they are the ' orthodoxMoslems and arrogate to themselves (as do also the Sunnis) the title of the ' True Believers.' They are chiefly found in Persia, Iraq and India (see Sunni). Sunni. —' Verily it will happen to my people even as it did to the Children of Israel. The Children of Israel were divided into seventy-two sects, and my people will be divided into seventy-three. Every one of these sects will go to Hell except one sect.' The Companions said : ' 0 Prophet, which is that ? ' He said : ' The religion which is professed by me and my Companions.' (Mishkat I, VI, 2.) The number has, however, far exceeded the Prophet's predictions, for the sects of Islam even exceed in number and variety those of the Christian religion. The Sunnis arrogate to themselves the title of ' those who are being saved (as, indeed, do the other sects), but within the limits of the Sunni section of Moslems there are four which are esteemed ' orthodox '—the Hanafi, the Shafi i, the Malaki and the Hanbali. (Hughes.) Taqrir. —The system whereby certain districts of the Moslem world are allotted by contract to the highest bidder for the sole or very select privilege of 'guiding' its inhabitants on pilgrimage (see Mutawwif). Ulama (pi. of Alim, q.r ), Wahhabi. —sect of Moslem revivalists founded in Nejd by Muhammad- bin-Abdul Wahhab {circ. 1750 a.d .). They originally branched from the Hanbali sect of Sunnis (q.v.) and are the Unitarians of Islam. Their tenets, now enforced by Wahhabi Committees of Virtue on the easy-going folk of the Hejaz, are stern and puritanical, a distinctive one being that women should not be allowed to visit the graves of the dead on account of their immoderate weeping. Their temporal power has always been connected with the Ibn Saud dynasty in Nejd, from the days of the Sand who captured Mecca in 1803 to the present day. Zamzam. —The sacred well within the precincts of the Mosque at Mecca, supposed to be the identical well where Hagar and Tshmael drank in the wilderness. (Hughes.) Zeydia. —A sect of the main Shia schism which flourishes in the mountainous parts of the Yemen (Arabia Felix) and is headed by the Imam Yahya. Zubeyda. —A spring of water rising in the hills beyond the plain of Arafat, carried by an aqeduct upon a 9-foot wall which skirts the Hill of Recognition, and conducted thence underground to Mecca.46 Appendix B.

I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the usual annual report on the pilgrimage to the Holy Places of the Hejaz in 1932. It is on the same general plan as last year, except that I have devoted a new special section to the question of ' Pilgrimage Tariffs and Cost of the Pilgrimage/' which became a subject of acute controversy this year, and have attempted to deal m a separate section, however short, with each important British element in the pilgrimage. The section on the Afghan pilgrimage is retained owing to its special interest for the Government of India, but I have suppressed the Iraqi section as Iraq has now its own representative in Jedda. I have given special attention to the section on 'Health,' in view of its great international importance. 2. In most cases the sections dealing with British elements in the pilgrimage are necessarily meagre. I should welcome any suggestions in connexion with them from the British authorities in the countries of origin. 3. Although I have edited the material freely, the enclosed report is almost entirely based on what has been supplied by members of my staff. Owing to my absence from Jedda from the 2nd February to the 30th May, the general work of supervision, co-ordination and conducting the more important correspondence, devolved for the first time on Mr. Hope Gill, who, assisted by the Chancery staff, performed it efficiently and gained valuable experience. I need not icpeat previous tributes to the Indian vice-consul and the medical officer in charge of the Government of India dispensary. Both worked with their usual zeal and efficiency in dealing with an exceptionally large Indian pilgrimage. I am happy to give Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah for the first time in a pilgrimage report the title conferred on him by his Excellency the Viceroy on the 1st January, a well merited recognition of his long service in connexion with the pilgrimage. Malay pilgrimage officer had this year a task unworthy of his seniority an ability but discharged it with his usual capacity. Captain B. W.

Although the internal situation in the Hejaz continued to be somewhat uneasy during the last three months of 1931 and the early part of this year, there were no developments so definite or so widely known as to discourage intending pilgrims. The most serious trouble in the autumn of 1931 was a threat of war between Ibn Saud and the Imam of the Yemen, who in August occupied the Jebel Arwa, a key position in the mountains inland from a line between Medi and Jizan. In September it looked as though a serious conflict was almost inevitable, but before the end of the month it was announced that Ibn hand had made and the Imam accepted proposals for a conference of delegates to determine the frontier and adjust differences. Little more was heard until December, when it was announced that the delegates had reached a deadlock ovei Jebel Arwa, that the Imam had thereupon left it to Ibn Saud to arbitrate on this question and that the King had given judgment against himself. The delegates thereupon continued their work with such expedition that a treaty of friendship, bon-voisinage and extradition was signed at Abu Arish on the 15th December. The Imam, who had got his mountain, subsequently made very light of this treaty settlement. Ibn Saud, who had lost the mountain, found himself in a stronger position in Asir, where there had been concomitant movements of disaffection and earned the commendation of the world, including the Moslem world, for his states manship and readiness to avoid quarrelling with a brother Arab and Moslem ruler. 2. Peace prevailed on Ibn Saud's other frontiers. There was no serious trouble with Iraq, although a minor quarrel started early in 1932 over a watering place on the frontier, a political dispute arose over the question whether the new Iraqi Legation should be located in Mecca or Jedda and the Hejazi Government . accommodating in the discussion of a proposal, to which they had agreed m principle, for the establishment of a motor route from Iraq to the Holy Cities, a project on which the Iraqi Government were and are very keen. Ibn Saud maintained his blockade of Koweit, but personal relations between him and the sheikh were good. Some minor frontier disputes were settled amicably, the King received with cordiality a visit paid him at Hofuf by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf m January and the Sheikh of Koweit paid a visit to Riadh in March. Except for one important incident in September 1931, raiding in the Iransjordan frontier was reduced to insignificant proportions, and the pilgrimage was well over before the invasion of the Hejaz by a rebel party of Hejazi exiles under one Hamed-bin-Rifada towards the end of May 1932 gave a new and acute tuin to the perennial Transjordan frontier question. 3- No publicity, except that of local rumour in the Heiaz, was given to a stm breeze between Ibn Saud and the British Government in Februarv and March. Jt had its oi igm in the uncompromising attitude taken up by the latter over themaam repatriation of a slave \\ ho had sought asylum in the British Legation and whom the King clainied as his personal property, but it developed on other lines It was amicably settled early m April. While it was still pending, Ibn Saud had decided to consolidate his foreign relations by sending a mission headed by his son, the Amir Feisal, to London and several other capitals. This mission started from Jedda three days before Pilgrimage Day, a choice of date which caused some local comment. 4. The financial and economic situation in the Hejaz continued to deteriorate during the period between the 1931 and 1932 pilgrimages. In the autumn of 1931 an attempt was made to reorganise certain branches of the Administration and to place the finances on a sounder basis. The King, who had gone to Riadh at the end of June 1931 and did not return to Mecca until April 1932, adopted these reforms under pressure from the Hejaz, but they were introduced too late to be effective. Further efforts, made early in 1932, including the engagement of a Dutch financial adviser, did nothing to remedy the financial situation of the Government. The depressed conditions among the population generally are described in paragraph 10 below. 5. It had been foreseen in the latter part of 1931 that the number of overseas pilgrims in 1932 would fail below even the greatly reduced figure for the previous season. The Hejazi Government set themselves to counteract the decreasing tendency by various measures. The tariff of official charges was published at a much earlier date than usual, namely, in July, and it held out a prospect of the reduction of certain items, notably the fees payable by Indian pilgrims to their mutawwifs. In the latter part of i931 Ibn Saud departed from previous Wahhabi policy by ordering repairs to various tombs and shrines at Medina, the neglect of which had outraged the feelings of large sections of the Moslem world. An intensive propaganda was carried on by mutawwifs and others in India, Egypt, Java and elsewhere to boom the pilgrimage by stimulating Moslem fervour. The chief factor in this appeal was the publication in the autumn of a pamphlet which definitely promised that the 1932 pilgrimage would be a Haj-ul-Akbar or Friday Haj, a source of sevenfold blessing. It had been calculated by astronomers that the new moon at the beginning of the month of pilgrimage would not merely take its place in the heavens, but would probably be visible from the earth on the right night to make Pilgrimage Day fall on the Friday nine days later. Many theologians consider it impious to anticipate such an event in any circumstances whatsoever. It was suggested in some quarters that Ibn Saud w T as sacrificing religious principle to lust for the money that pilgrims bring, and there was a good deal of criticism in certain sections of the foreign Moslem press of the categorical announcement of a Friday ITaj. It nevertheless produced a great effect in some countries, among which India was the most important. 6. Pilgrimage Day, the 9th Zil-Hijja, when all pilgrims congregate at Arafat, duly fell on Friday, the 15th April. 7. The climatic conditions were again favourable throughout the pilgrimage time. There would appear to have been more cases of heat-stroke than in 1931, but, thanks to the clemency of the season and the smallness of the pilgrimage, sanitary conditions generally were excellent. There were no epidemics and no occurrence of, or suspicion of, plague or cholera. Mortality, although apparently rather greater relatively to the total number of pilgrims than in 1931, was again satisfactorily lower. As will be seen from the detailed statement in section 4 below, the Hejazi sanitary arrangements suffered from a certain diminution of personnel and were not materially improved in other respects. The Indian and Dutch organisations worked on the usual lines. The Egyptian arrangements were on a reduced scale. Afghan medical assistance on a small scale was a new feature in 1932. 8. The total number of pilgrims from overseas showed a marked decrease, having fallen from 39,346 in 1931 to 29,065 in 1932. The decrease was spread very variably over the different national elements. It was most marked in the case of Java and Egypt, but certain countries of origin, among which were India, Afghanistan and Palestine, sent a greater number than last year. Detailed statistics are given in section 2 below. • 9. The number of persons assembled at Arafat on Pilgrimage Day was swollen by large contingents of overland pilgrims from Arabia. The Yemenis were again numerous and may have numbered about 8,000. The Koweit caravan [7721] B 2alone numbered about 1,500 persons. It is impossible to estimate the jyrand total. One Hejazi statement put the assemblage at Ararat as high as 150,000. This is evidently a fantastic figure. Ihe Indian vice-consul reckons that there may have been from 50,000 to 60,000 souls from all sources o\eisea and overland. 10. As in 1931. the average means and purchasing power of pilgrims generally were poor and were so largely devoted to satisfying the exigencies of the impoverished Hejazi Government that little margin was left for other expenditure, snch as that on pious souvenirs and the like. Ihe Hejazi merchants and retailers were even harder hit than in the preceding two years. The reduction to less than 5,000 of the once numerous and well-to-do pilgrims from the Dutch East Indies was a peculiarly heavy blow. Even the diminished quantities of goods imported by the merchants could not be marketed profitably and had to be sold in some cases at below cost price. Many retail shops in Jedda and Mecca were compelled to close down. The general depression was aggravated by poverty in the Hejaz itself, including that of Government employees of all kinds, whose salaries and wages fell heavily into arrear. Their sufferings were increased by a decision to treat all arrears previous to December 1931 as floating debt and by reduction of staff in various branches of the Administration. An arrangement made in the autumn of 1931 to pay off the floating debt gradually out of an assigned percentage of total revenue broke down and was replaced in June 1932 by an arrangement to commute claims into drafts on customs. Discontentment was rife, and for a time extended to the military and police, whom it was eventually arranged to pay in kind. The depression affected, in fact, every class of the community. A partial moratorium for rents became necessary in May 1932. Among the Hejazi tribes also there was widespread poverty, intensified by Government exactions of money for actual or alleged military purposes. Starving Bedouin were numerous in Medina and along the road to that place. There was heavy mortality among them in Medina during the months preceding the pilgrimage. 11. Pilgrims from many countries were gravely affected by the effect on their national currencies of the abandonment of the gold standard. For various reasons the effects of this were slow in manifesting themselves completely in the Hejaz. It had gone through a monetary crisis of its own in 1931, when the silver riyal broke away from its official parity with the English gold pound, which was, and remains, the basic currency of the country. Devices to rehabilitate the riyal, including a scheme to popularise its use in Nejd, were only partially successful. The effects of its depreciation, combined with those of the gold standard crisis, produced a practical situation which can best be illustrated by giving the approximate exchange rates ruling at the end of 1931 as follows Riyals. £ gold ... ... ... ... = 171 £ sterling ... ... ... ... — 12^ £ Egyptian ... ... ... ... =13 19 rupees ... ... ... ... = £ gold 12. Local prices in silver, which had reacted to the decline of the riyal in the earlier part of 1931, were not materially affected by the subsequent abandon ment of the gold standard in Great Britain and elsewhere. It might, indeed, have been a sound policy for the Hejazi Government (though this is a daring speculation) to substitute sterling for English gold as the basis of currency. In the event they took two decisions which adversely affected pilgrims from all countries where currencies were dependent on sterling. They insisted that all charges, however stated in their tariffs, must be paid on a gold basis and that Hejazi silver, if tendered in payment, must be computed not at its official value, but at its actual gold value. These decisions took definite shape too soon before the actual pilgrimage lor intending pilgrims generally to appreciate their effects, even in countries like India and Egypt, where special steps were taken to make them publicly known. In the case of India, where a tentative estimate of the probable cost of the pilgi image had been made public in the autumn, a considerable controversy arose owing to the attempts of the British authorities to make people realise that the cost 01 the pilgrimage in rupees would be greatly increased and counter propaganda by the Hejazi Government and their friends. A detailed account or this matter is given in section 9 below.14. .There was little change in the condition of the pilgrim roads. There was a further deterioration in motor transport, the owners of which had no inducement and no means to improve the quantity or quality of their rolling- stock. The financial condition of the pilgrims and the burden of Koshan, or road-tax, caused an increased proportion of pilgrims of the class who usually use such transport to take camels or even to walk. Some abandoned the journey to Medina, which for every Moslem is as important from a devotional, if not from a legal point of view, as that to Mecca and Arafat. Pilgrims generally were for the first time allowed to use cars on the journey from Mecca to Arafat, but the fares and Government tax were very high. Conditions on the journey back from Mecca to Jedda were ameliorated by the posting of about 100 soldiers at the sandiest part towards the Mecca end. They were of assistance to struggling cars, and rendered not a little help to pilgrims travelling by camel and donkey or on foot. This measure, which was in force for the return journey only, was taken at the suggestion of Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah. The road from Jedda to Medina continued to be very difficult, and to possess no conveniences except the coffee-houses at the various camel stages. 15. Securitv again prevailed on the pilgrim routes. There was, however, an increase in pilferage at the centres where pilgrims congregate. Cases of theft were reported to have occurred not only at Muzdalafa and at Mecca, even in the holy precincts, but also at Muna and Arafat. In Jedda, where for some reason this kind of thing had been rare, pilgrims were robbed while bathing in the sea. It is suggested that thefts in the inland centres were due to the machinations of mutawwifs and camelmen, and Moulana Ismail Ghuznavi drew the attention of the King to the misconduct of the former in this respect. The Indian vice-consul reports that, notwithstanding this, the attitude of the Director of Police in Mecca was unsatisfactory, and that he was readier to blame pilgrims themselves than to investigate complaints. 16. The King gave his usual banquet to some 500 notable pilgrims of various nationalities on the 12th April and addressed them at length. His speech was charged with religious emotion and appeals for unity in Islam. He recognised the value of material weapons like aeroplanes, &amp;c., but put the grace and power of God above them. He defended his own position as an upholder of true religion in the face of all criticism. He gave offence in certain quarters by such utterances as a reference to the bloodshed then clone, the sins committed and the peace violated under the Turkish and Shereefian regimes, and the words : ' By God, I fear the foreigner once, but I fear those who pretend to be Moslems three thousand times!' He referred to Moslem interference with Haramayn charities and Wakfs and with the performance of the pilgrimage. Speaking of the reports of poverty and famine in the Hejaz, which could not be laid to his blame, he said that he had not taken money from the Hejaz but had served it, e.g., by establishing security, and that he had naught of his own save his sword and the Koran. ' I declare openly,' he cried, 'that if any one of the Moslem Kings, princes or merchants want to do a benevolent deed for the Moslems in this country he is warmly welcome, provided he does not violate the honour of our country, neither does he affect our independence or anything of our religious matters /' He denied the rumour that he had contracted a loan with the English or others. 17. The Indian vice-consul was not invited, as he had been in previous years, to the King's dinner, possibly owing to resentment at the attitude of the British Legation in the controversy over the cost of the pilgrimage. On the 7th May, however. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah was given an opportunity of meeting His Majesty under the auspices of Ismail Ghuznavi, and secured a gracious hearing for his views on various pilgrimage matters. 18. Ibn Saud took the unusual course of receiving many influential pilgrims in audience. Among them were certain persons who had assisted at the Moslem Congress in Jerusalem m December 1931, a gathering which he had disliked and refrained from participating in but had not altogether discountenanced. He paid particular attention to Indians. He conducted long discussions with his visitors, impressing on them his desire to serve the whole Moslem world. Many of these pilgrims submitted suggestions to His Majesty, and one, Sardar Suleman Cassum Mitha, a member of the Indian Council of State, left behind a considered memorial dealing with various subjects of concern to pilgrims. At one moment the King projected a reception for some forty Indian pilgrims of all shades of opinion to discuss matters affecting the welfare of pilgrims generally and his own6 country. This was abandoned in favour of a meeting at the house of the Director-General of Finance, at which Moulana Hasrat Mohani severely criticised the Hejazi Government, and enquired as to the revenue from the pilgrimage and the manner of its disposal. A tendency is observable on the part oi some leading foreign Moslems to suggest that the pilgrim is over-exploited for the benefit of Ibn Baud's temporal power and pomp. Unusual efforts were made to conciliate influential pilgrims by the distribution of presents in the form of gold watches and robes, some of which, as well as portions of the cover of the Kaaba and other mementoes of the Holy Land, were sent to persons of distinction in India, among others the Nizam of Hyderabad. The grants to Indian papers, for which provision has been made since 1926 and which are administered by Moulana Ismail Ghuznavi, were renewed. Abdur-Rahman Malabari, the editor of a paper at Calicut, who came on pilgrimage this year was awarded a cash present of £30 and an annual allowance of £60. 19. Although there is little progress to be recorded this year in the Hejazi arrangements for the pilgrimage, there^are signs that the King's desire to improve them is genuine. He has criticised the misdeeds of mutawwifs and others, the more readily, perhaps, because he is conscious of antagonism to his regime in the Hejaz, and because he realises more and more the need for encouraging the flow of foreign pilgrims. His Director-General of Finance is busy on transport schemes. The improvement in the pilgrimage tariff for next year is referred to in paragraph 145 below. 20. The dispersal of the comparatively small number of oversea pilgrims was effected satisfactorily and without undue delay. Some difficulty arose in the case of Indians, owing to the apparent inability of Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Company's agents on certain occasions to notify the time of arrival of ships in Jedda except at very short notice. There is also a growing difficulty in connexion with the insufficiency of first and second class accommodation now that the pilgrimage is becoming increasingly popular among Indians of the better class. These causes add to the difficulty of solving another problem which lias been ventilated in India, that of providing means whereby pilgrims of this class may be enabled to stay as long as possible in Mecca or Medina, instead of coming to Jedda to wait for shipping. Other matters connected with the return to India are dealt with in section 10 below. 21. There was no change in the Hejazi arrangements for dealing with the effects of deceased pilgrims (see paragraphs 187 and 216 below). 22. Destitution among British pilgrims was again a problem after the 1932 pilgrimage. On the whole it did not give so much trouble as in 1931, but it is possible that all repatriation cases have not been disposed of at the time of writing (August 1932). Details are given in the sections dealing with the different elements in the pilgrimage. 23. The number of notable personages who came on pilgrimage in 1932 was again large. Among them are the following :—- His Highness the Nawab of Loharu; her Highness the Begum of Pataudir .Nawab Sir Shams Shah, the ex-Prime Minister of Kalat State; Nawab Sir Nizamat Jung Bahadur, late of the Hyderabad State Political Service: the Hon Sardar Suleman Cassum Mitha, C.I.E., a member of the Council of State; the widow of the late Nawab Sir Nasrullah Khan of Bhopal; Nawab Fakhar Yar Jung of Hyderabad; Khan Bahadur Obeidullah of Aligarh; Sultan Saif Nawaz^ Jung Salih-bin-Ghalib Qaitty; Sheikh Ismail-al-Azhari, a it . n .i ^e Sudan; his Royal Highness Sardar Ahmed Shah of Aighanistan, certain members of the ruling family of Bahrein, and a number of respectable pilgrims from North African countries . '\l ar § e nu ™ber of political agitators also came to perform the Haj this year Moulana Hasrat Mohani, Abdur Rahman Malabarv, Ahmed Din, the president of the Punjab branch of the Young Men's Association, Professor Abdul ? n a 17 ^ 0 t ® s ! la T ar ' an( ^ Iqbal Shaidi from France, are specially notable among them. In this class must be included Moulana Ismail Ghuznavi of mntsar but, while his anti-British convictions are unchanged, he appears to be sincerely devoted to the interests of pilgrims, and in 1932 as in 1931 was helpful ^ f l indian vl c e - con sul who is on excellent terms with him. This general attitude is well illustrated by the letter quoted in paragraph 83 below. ^S I . fL ^ without the Ha j. visited the Hejaz between iljij. the 1931 aid 932 seasons, were the iSawab of Bahawalpur, and Mr. A. K. 'fitJ Fazal-ul-Haqq o Bengal, the latter of whom had attended the Round Table Conference in London Nawab Osman Yar-ud-Dowlah, Officer Commanding thek Troops in t ^ -Hyderabad, paid a visit after the 1932 pilgrimage. % , Hastings, commanded by Captain Sandford, S.N.U. Red goll; Sea Sloops, paid the usual Haj visit to Jedda from the 12th to the 18th April and ki- part m the traditional Haj Regatta, on the 17th April, for the oflicers and Inli crews oi pilgrim ships It was not possible to arrange this year, as in 1930 and s fov 1^31, J-Or Somali naval ratings to take the opportunity of going on Hai during the ship's stay. ^ j &amp; o j &amp; f. 2~ tt There was again no trouble over the circulation of forged rupee notes p in the Hejaz. The French authorities in Syria laid by the heels this year one of the principal agents concerned in this traffic in Syria, and are, at the time of inll wrlt ^' stl ^ investigating the matter. Nothing more was heard of the plot about which the Hejazi Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs spoke to Sir Andrew Ryan i(U in 1931 ( see paragraph 18 of the preceding report), but the proceedings in Syria ,. seem to have become known to various persons in the Hejaz, including some who ; : may have been concerned in the business. ; ■ 28. Questions connected with the organisation of various British sections kv ^ pilgrimage continued to be the subject of correspondence between the Legation and the various Governments concerned since the date of the last report. The Government of India devoted much attention to the various matters arising lp out or the Haj Enquiry Committee's report, and, inter alia, prepared an ; important Bill to amend the Indian Merchant Shipping Act in accordance with ; ffi certain of the committee's recommendations. Financial stringency in India has retarded the adoption of certain measures designed to better pilgrimage , ■ conditions, including proposals for an improved organisation of the Indian and medical sections of the Legation, in which, nevertheless, certain changes for the better have been effected. The scheme for a closer control of the Nigerian imt pilgrimage took final shape in the autumn of 1931. The small but diflicult sol® question of regularising the position in regard to British Somalis in the Hejaz, 'adofi who reach the country by devious routes, is still being pursued. One of the 'timtil features of the period immediately following the 1932 pilgrimage was the run on the Legation by Palestinian and Transjordanian pilgrims to draw moneys km deposited with the authorities in Palestine before they started. Progress was made with a scheme for promoting the adoption of a uniform type of pilgrim pass itei by the British Governments in Africa most interested in the pilgrimage, other 131,1 than those of Nigeria and the Sudan, who have adopted improved forms of pass tks suited to their special requirements. It is hoped that the form prepared for ifi general use in dependencies exporting substantial, though not large, numbers of pilgrims, will be adopted by the Governments of Kenya, Uganda, Zanzibar, eiilt Kyasaland, Tanganyika and Somaliland. 29. No settlement has been arrived at between Hejaz-Nejd and Egypt, and , there was no Sacred Caravan from the latter country. The Egyptian consul in loiri Jedda left in September 1931, and did not return until June 1932, when the Jaft pilgrimage was well over. It has just been announced, at the moment of writing icaU (August 1932), that the Egyptian Government has contracted with the Misr ael Company for the transport of pilgrims from Egypt for twenty years, beginning oH in 1935. hofi' 30. The advent of an Afghan mission, which combined the making of the ail# pilgrimage with diplomatic negotiations, brought Afghanistan into closer in# relations with Hejaz-Nejd, and was accompanied or followed by measures la# affecting Afghan pilgrims, which are dealt with elsewhere (see paragraphs 87 and 198-200). 31. The Kiswah, or cover for the Kaaba, which was formerly supplied by • orff ; f Egypt, and which has in recent years been manufactured at a special factory, with a mainly Indian staff, in Mecca, was this year ordered from Germany, the fabric of# prepared there being completed by stitching on the gold embroidered waist or arM huzam used last year. The silver embroidered door-curtain was also that of last 0 year, suitably altered. Manv Indian and other pilgrims resented the employment apF 1 ; of infidels to prepare the cover and to handle the sacred texts inscribed on it 1# Certain leading Indians brought this complaint to the King s notice.8 32 A law on Wakfs of great interest to foreign Moslems was published in September 1931. It authorised the registration of real property m the name of foreign subjects for the sole purpose ot the simultaneous constitution of a Wakf, which must be for a religious purpose beneficial to persons m the Hejaz, not for the benefit of the founders' descendants. The law confirms by inference the rule that foreigners, irrespective of religion, may not acquire leal property for ordinary purposes in the Hejaz, a restriction which m former times did not operate against IVToslems. It is now generally enforced, although it is still relaxed, by what must be regarded as an overriding exercise of so\eieign authority, m favour of certain foreign Moslems resident in the countr\. 33. Two cases which came to the notice of the Legation after the 1931 pilgrimage prove definitely that even nowadays the pilgiimage can be used as a cloak for small slavery transactions. In one case two Abyssinian boys were induced bv another person in Abyssinia to make the pilgi image, ai rived in the spring of 1931 with regular passports, and were sold into slavery at Mecca after the Haj. The facts came out when one of them fled to the Legation. The other case was that of a Nigerian, who came with his employer to the Hejaz in 1930, or possibly 1931, was sold, and took refuge in the Legation last December. This case is still under investigation in Nigeria, but the essential facts are already established. It is only right to state that the Hejazi Government admitted on enquiry that the persons involved were wrongfully enslaved. The cases are, nevertheless, disquieting, because, for three persons coming to the notice of the Legation, there may be others more numerous who have no opportunity of seeking redress. ' In the specific cases, the two Abyssinians were repatriated at the expenses of the Ethiopian Government by special arrangements, and the Nigerian was embarked for Port Sudan. (2) Statistics. 34. It is considered advisable to warn readers of this report that all pilgrimage statistics should be accepted with a good deal of reserve. Efforts are made to secure the best information available, but an examination of recent reports reveals many discrepancies; nor is this report free from them. It may be hoped that the margin of error is less in the case of highly organised sections of the pilgrimage, especially those in which there is homogeneity in the race and nationality of the pilgrims embarking at particular ports. Attention is drawn in paragraph 228 to the irreconcilability of the figures obtained in Jedda with those of the Sudan Medical Service in the comaratively simple case of Sudanese embarking at Suakin, the only authorised pilgrim port. 35. The resultant effect of the two opposing forces, viz., economic distress in the countries of origin and the propaganda mentioned in paragraph 5 above, was to produce great variations in the percentage of pilgrims from the principal overseas countries of origin, who went to make up the total of 29,056 in 1932, as compared with 39,346 in 1931. The most spectacular decline was in the number from the Dutch East Indies, which would normally provide from 30 to 40 per cent, of the total, but this year accounted for only 4,375 or less than a sixth of the whole. The reduction in the once important Malayan pilgrimage was propor tionally even greater, the total for this year being only eighty. The Egyptian pilgrimage was less than half that of 1931, and there was a similar decline in the number of West Africans. On the other hand, the number of Indian pilgrims showed an increase from 7,276 in 1931 to 9.634 in 1932, while there were similar increases in the contingents from Afghanistan, Syria and Palestine as well as from certain African countries including Morocco, where the Haj-ul -Akhar is said to make a strong appeal. 36. The following tables give the usual detailed statistics in the same form as in the report for 1931, except that thev are for two years only, the earlier figures being available in that report in the same order. ' In one respect it has been possible to ensure somewhat greater accuracy, as the new Director of Quarantine has been helpful in enabling the Khan Bahadur to determine th&amp; number of pilgrims of various nationalities who landed at Yambo.115 39,346 98 29,065 (i) The bulk of the Egyptian pilgrims were carried in French ships in this year.

For the first time in recent history no pilgrim ship from India was obliged to land pilgrims at Kamaran. Thanks to the efforts made by the adminis trative and other authorities in India, all pilgrims had been not only vaccinated but inoculated against cholera prior to embarkation, with the exception of a girl of 11 months old on board the Akbar,' who was vaccinated by the ship s doctor before reaching Kamaran. Although voluntary action had thus given excellent results, it is satisfactory to know that the Government of India have included in the Bill to amend the Indian Merchant Shipping Act mentioned in paragraph 28 provisions to make vaccination and inoculation compulsory. 39. In these circumstances, all ships from India as well as those from the Dutch East Indies and Malaya were subjected to medical inspection only at Kamaran. There was one case of mild small-pox on board the ' Akbar,' but the patient had recovered before the ship reached Kamaran, and no ship was delayed. 40. No cases of infectious disease were discovered on ships which had proceeded from Kamaran to Jedda. 41. The Hejazi Government formally declared the pilgrimage clean on the '4er 18th April. This declaration was confirmed by the opinion of the Indian medical l)j officer, and in due course by the Permanent Commission of the Alexandria Quarantine Board, which on the 29th April also declared the pilgrimage clean in accordance with reports received from the board's delegate in the Hejaz and the medical authorities at 1 or. In these circumstances, no south -bound ships leturning to India and Malaya were required to call at Kamaran,11 42. The question of the reported discovery of twenty cases of small-pox in the ' Rahmani ' on her arrival in Bombay early in May is dealt with in the following section, as it was suggested that there had been an epidemic of the disease at Medina and that insufficient precautions had been taken at the time of embarkation. 43. The correspondence regarding the principles to be observed in deciding whether or not south-bound ships should be required to call at Kamaran in accordance with article 149 of the International Sanitary Convention of 1926 was completed early in 1932. The upshot can best be described by reproducing the following rules, &amp;c., deduced by His Majesty's Minister from the correspondence as a whole : — (1) The diseases to be taken into consideration are limited to {a) cholera on any scale, however small; (b) plague on any scale, however small; (c) small-pox on epidemic scale. (2) His Majesty's representative will form his judgment with reference to (a) the reports of the local authorities; (b) the opinion of the medical officer of the Legation; {c) the opinion, if available easily and without delay, of the representative of the Alexandria Quarantine Board; {d) the results, if available, of any bacteriological examination in any particular case or cases of suspected cholera or plague; and (e) any other general elements of appreciation. (3) In forming his judgment His Majesty's representative will always consider {h) as well as {a), and will endeavour to make use of any other elements but will not in their absence normally delay his decision regarding south-going ships ready to sail. (4) Suspicion, revealed by bacteriological examinations, of the occurrence of cholera or plague will necessitate the same action provisionally, as if these diseases had occurred; but see paragraph 11 below. (5) His Majesty's representative will require ships to call at Kamaran if he has evidence of the occurrence of diseases as in paragraph 1 or suspicion as in paragraph 4. (6) If in doubt. His Majesty's representative will take the views of the Governments of India and Malaya by telegraph. (7) If satisfied by both 2 {a) and (5) and any other available elements of appreciation that the pilgrimage is free from disease as in para graph 1 or suspicion as in paragraph 4, His Majesty's representative may dispense ships from calling at Kamaran. ^ i-r- ^ (8) Anv decision taken under paragraphs 5 and 7 may be modified subsequently in the light of further information, e.g., from the Alexandria Quarantine Board. , (9) Decisions under paragraphs 5, 7 and 8 will be notified by telegraph to India, Malava and Kamaran. t t • u (10) The Alexandria Quarantine Board will notify to the Legation by telegraph all decisions in connexion with the sanitary state of the returning pilgrims. , . ^ ^ j , -n ^ (11) A ' suspect ' declaration by the Alexandria Quarantine Board will not of itself entail the necessity of requiring ships to call at Kamaran (12) His Maiesty's representative will correspond direct with Government ot India in the Department of Education, Health and Lands and the Governor of the Straits Settlements, on any question arising under the above. not calling at Kamaran and having to pay [7721] w ty v—' _ the dues there. The Resident at Aden c 212 ascertained that the Italian vessels had in fact carried a small number of pilgrims as ' native passengers and had not infringed the regulations regarding such passengers. He arranged, however, that all travelling papers issued at Aden should be endorsed as for a journey via Kamaran, and communicated to the Legation a suggestion of the Civil Administrator at Kamaran that the foreign representatives at Jedda should take action to prevent ships of their flags from landing at Jedda pilgrims from outside the Red Sea without presenting a Kamaran bill of health. Prima facie this suggestion seems to the Legation impracticable, if onty because the British representative in Jedda cannot control either the clearance of ships or the landing of passengers. The matter is still, however, the subject of correspondence. Tor. 45. The usual measures of observation were applied to pilgrims on board returning ships and all were subjected to the regulation seventy-two hours' detention. No grounds for suspicion were detected and, as stated elsewhere, the Permanent Commission of the Alexandria Quarantine Board formally declared the pilgrimage clean on the 29th April. 46. The Alexandria Board sent, as usual, a delegate to the Hejaz in the person of Dr. Abdul Hamid Kassim, who had acted for the first time in the same capacity in 1931. Suakin. 47. All pilgrims returning to the Sudan and other African destinations underwent the regulation quarantine of five days at Suakin. Here also no grounds of suspicion were detected. Jedda. 48. No quarantine measures were applied to ships arriving at Jedda and no occasion seems to have arisen for isolating individual cases of infectious disease. The position at the quarantine islands (see paragraph 34 of the report for 1931) remained unchanged. They still, like the hospital in the towm, lack disinfecting apparatus. 49. The port medical service was again maintained by two officers. The former senior officer. Dr. Siuti, having resigned in January was succeeded by his junior. Dr. Yahya, also a Syrian, who enjoys a good reputation and stands well with the British Legation. The additional burden imposed on the quarantine doctors, owing to the lack of medical officers in the town, is described in the following section. (4) Health. General. 50. As stated in section (1), health conditions generally were good through out the 1932 season. Pilgrims again benefited by the comparative coolness of the season in which the pilgrimage now falls, and the sanitary position as a whole was similar to that of last year subject to the variations noted below. Hejazi Medical Service. 51. Currency was given by Renter early in January to a report, apparently 10m an Lgyptian source, that the doctors in the Hejazi service had resigned en masse. It was true that there had been much discontent, due to non -payment u a dissatisfaction with the general conditions of service, and that there ad been some resignations. The reports of a complete disintegration of the service howe\er, grossly exaggerated. The Legation estimated the total num ei oi omcial doctors in the country at about eleven, exclusive of two Eoyal physicians, as compared with eighteen in 1932, and saw no ground for unusual aime y, avmg legard to the probable diminution in the number of pilgrims and e ie lance which could be placed on the medical assistance normally provided b&gt; foreign Powers viz., the Government of India, the Netherlands and Egypt. 0 • . e shortage of official doctors was nevertheless severe. One of its v ZISITZ C0 ' S ! qUences was : ^ no se Parate medical staff, apart from an hwwn tyiq I o ?! ? C 01 ' T as a ^ ai ^ a ^ e f or the hospital in Jedda, previously served oc ors, who were also responsible for the dispensary work in the ?13 re'-.: town and public health matters. The hospital was much neglected and was for m &amp; time 1 the char f e 1 of the official dentist from Mecca/ It was eventually arranged that one oi tne two quarantine doctors should be put in charge of the lati hospital as ^e I. J his gentleman, Dr. Ibrahim Edhim, had onlv recently been appointed, on the promotion of Dr. Yahya, to the post of second quarantine J doctor. , tk■ 53 - Another consequence of the shortage was that at the height of the ; : pilgrimage season, the Government, who had done little to fill vacancies, were compelled to summon doctors from outlying places, including Nejd and Hasa. for temporary sei\ice in Mecca. [his enabled them to employ a strength of nine or ten doctors at Mecca during the critical period, five of these being outsiders. 54. The following revised statement, based on the information collected by the Indian medical officer attached to the Legatiom brings up to date, subiect to [nmsij possible inaccuracies of detail, the general account of the Heja'zi medical % establishment given in the report for 1931. elsft^ _ ''^j Jedda. iHejsi|| 55. One hospital, well but remotely situated at the southern end of the town, Eeiiti;; with about twenty beds in use and seventy more in store. A one-room municipal dispensary in the centre of the town. Small quarantine establishment at the port. Rooms formerly used as hospital quarters for soldiers in the barracks outside the town, which are presumably unused owing to removal of bulk of troops, p No medical staff, except the quarantine doctors (see above) and an Egyptian lady doctor permanently employed, but not, apparently, very competent. One dispenser, a Syrian, with two assistants, serving hospital and town dispensary, which is visited by the quarantine doctors in their leisure. No free medicines. In addition to the Government establishment there are two private dispensaries run by a Syrian and a Turk. One Turkish doctor in private practice, and one Jf 11 other, also a Turk formerly in Government employment, who seems, however, to ctioisi- have given up active practice, port I: ; ^ Mecca. oiffi 56. Central hospital not far from the Haram, well constructed and equipped mdr so far as appliances go. Sixty-eight beds in all, not including forty provided in idstr connexion with projected extension of work. Small hospital for infectious heiji® diseases at Gabban in the town, open during the 1932 pilgrimage season, but since icriW- closed. Dispensary at central hospital and one branch dispensary elsewhere in the town. Small building used as a lunatic asylum, without medical staff or special equipment. According to the press, two collapsible sheds of light material outside the town were provided for infectious diseases this year, but they do not seem to have been used. Apart from the Director-General of Public Health, in general charge, the normal staff of the Central Hospital has consisted this year ^ of one dentist, who is related to and acts as assistant to the director-general, one ^0 surgeon, two other doctors and one dresser, reinforced from outside during the actual pilgrimage time as stated above. Two dispensers with four assistants. It was announced in the press in January that plans were being made for new X-ray and surgical departments, the building of which, at the expense of a Syrian benefactor, had been foreshadowed last year. Building was in progress when 1 the Indian medical officer visited the hospital in February, and it was also ' ;il intended to provide a separate ward for maternity cases. It is not very clear how far these arrangements were operative during the pilgrimage season. It ii i: may be noted in connexion with the proposed improvements, that of two doctors rati who had been sent to Paris for study, with a view to providing specialised staff, one returned to the country towards the end of 1931 only to flee from it oftfr surreptitiously in January, pjv Mum. [jjg 57. A temporary hospital, with about twenty-four beds, was again main- Or tained during the festival days. It was attended by staff detached from the above establishment at Mecca,' but was used only for emergency treatment, all .jonilf? serious cases being transferred to Mecca.11 Road from Mecca to Arafat. 58 Nine sheds for first aid, with lighting, sign-boards flags and ample provision of water. Three others not used in 1932; served as a whole by one doctor, with a dispenser and a servant. Ambulance cai patiol. Road from Jedda to Mecca. 59. Part of a modern house is set aside for use as a dispensary, but was in charge this year of a barber from Mecca and one seivant. 1 he acconnnodation includes twelve beds. Arafat. 60. Medical assistance of any kind is of little avail at Arafat, owing to the congestion and irregular arrangement of the temporary encampment; nor do. pilgrims, absorbed in their devotions, seek it except in extreme cases. The Government, however, provided six motor lorrries, six or seven cabs and a motor cycle. Each car w r as provided with a moderate outfit of necessary medicines, Servants were available to deal w r ith dead bodies in case of need. Medina. 61. One hospital working in 1932. An Egyptian doctor officially employed. There are in private practice two Indians, Dr. Muhammad Hussain, formerly British vice-consul in Jedda, now an old man, and a Hyderabadi homoeopathic practitioner, who works under the auspices of the Hyderabad State and seems to have a large practice. There is also a Syrian chemist. Yamho. 62. A small dispensary and one Egyptian doctor. J izan. 63. A dispensary was projected and a Turkish doctor was appointed, but resigned. It is apparently proposed to find a new man. Taif. 64. A small dispensary. One doctor, apart from any who may be in attendance on the King or the Amir Feisal when in residence there, like the Director-General of Public Health and the personal physicians. 65. The above is believed to be a reasonably correct account of the whole medical establishment in Hejaz-Kejd at the time of the 1932 pilgrimage, except for doctors with dispensaries at two or three outlying places, which hardly concern pilgrims, like Abha and Hasa. An Indian doctor has recently been appointed, it is understood, to Qatif; and provision on a moderate scale for other places, including Jizan (vacant) and Wejh, has been under consideration. The general account show r s that the Hejazi medical arrangements of 1932 did not differ materially from those described in paragraphs 40 to 42 of the report for 1931, but were adversely affected by the reduction in the total number of doctors described in paragraph 51 and following paragraphs. There continues to be a great lack of competent specialists, and of arrangements for isolating infectious cases, even in Mecca. The defects in the organisation must be put down not only to administrative incapacity, but also, and in an increasing measure, to financial stringency. To give one example of the effects of the latter, the one well-equipped hospital in the country, viz., the central hospital at Mecca, is said to be unable to provide any food except bread for indoor patients. 66. The Indian medical officer has prepared the following statement of cases treated and deaths in Government hospitals during the period of the 1st August, 1931, to the 31st July, 1932, from the returns published in the local press. The statement may be compared with that for the first seven months of 1931, given m15 , O' aix liJ paragraph 2b of the leport for 1931, but the comparison reveals contrasts so remarkable as to cast doubt on the value of any such returns.

There were no epidemics of contagious or infectious disease and no cases or suspicion of plague or cholera. Small-pox, which is endemic in the Hejaz, came to the immediate notice of the Indian doctors, but not on any considerable scale, and there is no evidence to support the rumour which subsequently reached India that it assumed epidemic form in Medina. Chicken-pox, on the other hand, was more than usually prevalent, and a number of persons suffering from it were relanded after embarkation from returning ships, apparently owing to suspicion on the part of the ships' doctors that the symptoms might prove to be those of small-pox. In spite of the favourable climatic conditions, cases of sunstroke were more frequent than in 1931, but without causing any marked mortality. Sporadic cases of typhoid and paratyphoid occurred on much the same scale as in 1931. Cases of dysentery and diarrhoea were much less numerous than last year, 68. The Legation was informed by the Government of India, on the 17th June, that twenty cases of small-pox had been discovered among pilgrims landed at Bombay from one returning ship, the steamship 'Rahmani,' which sailed from Jedda on the 25th April, with 1,774 pilgrims on board. The Government of India enquired as to the truth of the rumour mentioned above that there had been an epidemic at Medina, and of allegations by the ship's doctor and officers that adequate steps had not been taken at Jedda to prevent the embarkation of infected cases. His Majesty's Minister telegraphed the following reply on the 26th June :— ' Small-pox is endemic in this country. There is no evidence of its having occurred in epidemic form or been unusually prevalent at Medina or elsewhere. Indian medical officer states that chicken-pox was more prevalent than usual this year, and there appears to have been some tendency on part of cautious ships' doctors to diagnose it as possible small-pox. ' All passengers on ' Rahmani ' were pilgrims who came this year, and all were ordinary return ticket-holders, except three, who had come via Basra. In these circumstances it is assumed that all had been recently vaccinated in India. This is only real safeguard, as Legation has no machinery for medical inspection of returning pilgrims, and any steps to cause Hejazi authorities to undertake individual inspection would encourage vexatious interference without ensuring good results. Doctors of pilgrim ships normally look at pilgrims as they are embarked and examine any presenting palpable signs of infectious' disease. This year they rejected several pilgrims whose cases were afterwards diagnosed on shore as chicken-pox.' ' c May I have by despatch evidence of alleged negligence, information as to where cases in question first showed small-pox symptoms, and suggestions for future precautions within limits indicated above ?16 It may be observed in this connexion that, according to the printed proceedings of the Alexandria Quarantine Boards their delegate m the Hejaz merely mentioned ' cas sporadiqnes de variole, in iiis summary telegraphic report to the board after the festival. Mortality. 69. The mortality among pilgrims generally was estimated at about 2 per cent. The percentage for Indians was estimated at 1'30 per cent, and for Javanese at 1-72 per cent. Of three deaths reported from Arafat, one was due to accident from hustling by soldiers in the crush and one was that r of a child born on the spot, and the third that of an aged pilgrim. Deaths at p Muna were estimated at a maximum of forty-two, including one due to smallpox, 'j, a few to sunstroke and others attributed to old age or chronic disease. No deaths ^ by motor accident were reported in this area, but see paragraph 235 as to one :j on the way back to Jedda. General Sanitary Conditions. 70. Conditions generally were similar to those described in para graphs 48-50 of the report for 1931. The hygienic methods employed were of the same elementary description, water-sprinkling, moderate use of disinfectants and superficial food inspection. Heavy rains at intervals during the months preceding the pilgrimage and the lack of any measures to prevent the accumula tion of water in pools facilitated the excessive breeding of mosquitoes. The slaughtering place at Muna was in the same place as last year somewhat away from the main area of congestion, but there were fewer restrictions on the disposal of carcases, the poorer pilgrims being allowed to remove them freely to their quarters. 71. Foot-and-mouth disease occurred in the Heiaz in the spring of 1932. Water Supply. 72. Water was again plentiful at all the main centres and relatively cheap, but there was the usual lack of protection against contamination. The Ain Zubeyda Committee at Mecca continues to do good work, and appears at the time of writing (August 1932) to contemplate the purchase of an important quantity of new material. Jedda continues to depend on its two condensers and various wells, the water from which is inferior but cheaper. These were well supplied this season owing to heavy rains early in the year. Following an extensive survey for water by an American engineer, Mr. Twitchell, an attempt was made in the latter part of 1931 to make the well-water at Waziriya, a place some 8 miles from Jedda, available as regular source of supply to the town. The water there is of reasonably good quantity, though opinions differ as to its excellence. It is said to be abundant enough to supply all the needs of Jedda, and it was proposed to recondition the old but long disused Turkish conduit leading to the town. An American windmill was duly erected over one well and some work was done on the conduit, but the scheme has so far been unsuccessful as far as the reconditioning of the latter is concerned. Government of India Dispensaries. 73. The dispensary at Jedda remained open as usual throughout the year following the 1931 pilgrimage season. The dispensary at Mecca was opened on the 20th February and closed on the 1st June. The staff was strengthened for j the 1932 season by the addition of temporary personnel consisting of Sub-Assistant Surgeon Jamadar Abdul Aziz from India, one compounder and two servants employed locally. At the actual pilgrimage time the whole staff, except one enfeebled permanent servant, was mobilised at Mecca to cope with the congestion of pilgrims there. A temporary dispensary was opened at Muna iu the house rented for the festival by the Indian vice-consul and Dr. Abdul Hamid at their own expense. It was provided with a sign, but did not attract many pilgrims, partly, it is said, because mutawwifs are not keen on directing pilgrims to it. The staff was, as usual, in attendance at Arafat, but little can be done there for the reasons given in paragraph 60 above. 74. The dispensary accommodation at Jedda still leaves much to be desired, and the unexpected influx of Indian pilgrims put a strain this year on the accommodation in the one house rented for pilgrimage purposes at Mecca. The (aovernment of India have for financial reasons been unable to sanction proposals iijst !' f ^k\ iiitier ifisl' t: I T&gt; if tog ] jies. I ft in I A m-BI #tio' tleDu liter p I t : Mstn17 made last year that a house separate from the general office building of the Legation should be rented at Jedda and that a second house should be taken at Mecca as an experimental measure. The difficulty is likely to be overcome in the near future. On the other hand, it is unfortunate that financial stringency should stand in the way of such small improvements in the existing accommoda tion as seem desirable from time to time, e.g., whitewashing and minor repairs. His Majesty s Minister feels very strongly that both dispensaries should be whitewashed annually towards the beginning of the pilgrimage season. It is estimated that this would cost £10 for each, and Dr. Abdul Hamid asks for £4 in addition for minor repairs at Mecca next year. These amounts would be additional to the contingency fund of £36 per annum which has already been sanctioned. 75. The permanent and temporary staff worked satisfactory. This commendation includes Sub-Assistant Surgeon Jamadar Abdul Aziz, but Dr. Abdul Hamid suggests that in future a non-military surgeon, with experience in civil hospitals, would be more suited to the character of the pilgrim clientele. Cases Treated. 76. The total number of cases treated at the Jedda dispensary from the 30th June, 1931, to the 1st June, 1932, was 39,231 as compared with 26,458 in the previous year. Of these, 3,250, as compared with 3,205 in 1931, were treated during the pilgrimage season, i.e., from the 30th January to the 1st June, 1932. The number of cases treated at Mecca from the 20th February to the 1st June, 1932, was 13,215 as compared with 12,125 in 1931. Two hundred and fifteen cases were treated at Muna. 77. Twenty-four indoor cases were treated during the year, work on a large scale being precluded by the limited nature of the available accommodation and facilities. 78. Two hundred and fifty-six and 452 minor operations were performed by the Indian medical officer at Jedda and Mecca during the year. 79. A large proportion of the cases treated at Jedda throughout the year were non-British, owing to the popularity of the dispensary and the lack of other facilities, what with the reduction in the Hejazi medical personnel and the fact that the Dutch dispensary functions only in Mecca for a considerable time before and after pilgrimage day. The great majority of the patients treated in Mecca were British. The charges made at Jedda for medicines supplied to non-British persons produced about £50. The income from this source at Mecca was negligible. 80. The following table shows the percentage of the various diseases among the cases treated in all the dispensaries:—■ Medical. Percentage. 1. Malaria and its complications ... 25-5 2. Other fevers and infectious diseases ... 1 • 5 3. Urinary diseases, including ghonorrhoea 16-5 4. Digestive troubles ... ... ••• 14-51 5.

The Government of India have not yet given a ruling on the proposal made by His Majesty's Minister last year that the dispensary surgeons should be allowed in suitable cases to charge fees for attending patients outside the dispensaries during the pilgrimage season. It is desirable that this should be allowed in order to discourage well-to-do pilgrims from calling the doctors out without adequate justification, e.g., see paragraph 129. Ihis abuse was more serious in 1932 than in 1931. The number of visits entailed was fifty. The difficulty of dealing with any large number of outside cases is increased by the restrictive and sometimes quite unreasonable attitude of the local authorities in regard to the use of private cars, a subject to which it is intended again to draw the attention of the Hejazi Government before next season. 82. Dr. Abdul Hamid was confronted by a novel difficulty owing to the presence among the Indian pilgrims of doctors who prescribed for their friends and asked that their prescriptions should be made up at the Government dispensary at Mecca. At the outset he complied with requests of this sort made by a former teacher of his at Lahore. lie subsequently thought it unwise to allow the practice to grow, as the making-up of such prescriptions is outside his province, and the doctors have no recognised status in the Hejaz, so that in case of any serious misadventure he might be held responsible. His Majesty 's Minister endorses his view that the practice should be strongly discouraged. 83. One of the patients treated by Dr. Abdul Hamid at Mecca and Jedda was the well-known Indian Wahhabi propagandist Ismail Ghazanvi. The following letter of gratitude is worth reproducing in full :— (Beginning : ' In the name of God !') ' Dear Dr. Abdul Hamid Sahib, Mecca, May 24, 1932. ' This is a known fact that I am strictly against any British influence or interference in the sacred Hejaz. This interference may be with a good intention or a bad one, I think it my bounden duty to oppose. But, I, cannot deny the real facts that you have got a high name as a physician and surgeon in Jedda and Mecca. The Indian pilgrims are very grateful to you and pray for your long life and prosperity, and appreciation of this work of yours by the British Government. The greatest pain, attention, care and love that you evince in the treatment of patients have made the people indebted to you; The stock of medicines kept in your dispensaries, together with the treatment accorded there, is above praise. But the indoor arrangement is a little deficient and requires improvement. The surgical instruments are sufficient in number, but their use appears to be limited on account of probably less accommodation for keeping the indoor patients. I record with great sorrow that you left the services of the Hejaz Government, which useful work you would have done from that side, and it 'would ha\e been a pleasure to me, as well. But, still in the end I wish you every success. ' I am, &amp;c.

Some progress in this direction was made ^ lie.] az end this year. There appears to have been a certain amount of P u 1 , C1 y in India. Dr. Abdul Hamid accompanied the Indian vice-consul on board all pilgrim ships arriving from India. In Jedda pilgrims coming to the Indian section of the Legation for registration are told where to find the ispensary. t is more difficult to ensure their understanding the arrangements at Mecca partly because the dispensary there is at some distance from the Haram. As legai ds publicity m India, see paragraph 191. •%of: %ow r ^ ie E ^; ptian ^ rran g em ents were, as compared with those of previous FovnHan S Sl P r ?P ort i on ed to the greatly decreased number of cornnri^rl fL ^.

The Egyptian Other Foreign Medical Assistance. rr hi1U Tekke, a Wakf institution, is a separate and permanent institution at Mecca, served by two doctors. It provides free treatment and medicines. There is no medical side to the corresponding Tekke at Medina. 86. The Netherlands Government had arrangements similar to those described m paragraph 64 of the report for 1931. 87. The Afghan Government provided for the first time a small medical service consisting of one doctor, a Punjabi named M. Salih Hashmi, and one dispenser, who carried on dispensing work in one small room in a house close to the Haram. 1 he doctor is said to have spent most of his time visiting his friends. 88. No other Government provides medical assistance specifically for pilgrims. The Russian, Professor Moshkowsky, who was formerly attached to the Soviet Legation and was a bacteriologist of some distinction, used to render assistance on occasion to the ITejazi authorities, but he left Jedda with his wife in 1931. They were replaced in February by a married couple, both practitioners, the husband being a neurologist, the wife a bacteriologist and obstetrician. They started a paying dispensary of sorts, but their professional ability seems to be poor. They are hampered by apparently knowing only Russian, except that one of the two has a little French. (5) Internal Transport in the Hejaz. Motor Transport. 89. Khan Bahadar Ihsanullah introduces his report on this subject by a series of reflexions on the frustration of many of the hopes that were founded on the potentialities of motor vehicles as a means of conveyance for pilgrims. He recalls the time when pilgrims started on the long adventure with so little certi tude of return that the practice grew up of including a shroud in the travelling equipment of each, and observes that, when Ibn Saud had established security on the road, it was expected that the once arduous journey from Jedda to Mecca and Medina could be effected rapidly and comfortably by car. Despite the comparative increase in speed which does undoubtedly result from the use of motor transport, this expectation was to a large extent defeated. ' It seems,' says the Khan Bahadur, '' that nature has ordained that unmingled comforts and conveniences should not be the destiny of pilgrims and miseries and hardships would constitute an indispensable and inseparable function of the pilgrimage ceremony. The iron rule of Ibn Saud and the consequent prevalence of peace and security could not contradict nature's design, and the void was soon compensated by the role of the Motor Transport Service.'' He goes on to describe the disappointment of those Moslems of the easier classes, who have been attracted by the modern facilities to make the pilgrimage in greatly increased numbers, at finding how long it still takes to reach the Holy Cities and how many discomforts have to be endured ; discomforts all the greater as, anticipating short runs such as they would make over similar distances in their countries of origin, they do not realise the necessity for taking the necessary provisions for the journey. The Khan Bahadur draws a moving picture of the plight of many pilgrims marooned owing to the breakdown of their cars or lorries on sun-scorched roads and the efforts to which even persons of the highest degree are reduced to drag the vehicles out of the sand under the eyes of famished women and children. 90. This picture may be somewhat overdrawn. The Khan Bahadur himself quotes high personages from the remoter parts of India as comparing the Hejazi roads not imfavourablv with those in their own countries. The roads to Mecca and Medina are undoubtedly bad, but the major trouble arises from the arrange ments for running the cars and the failure of the Government to ensure their being kept in ^ood running order or efficiently driven. In 1932, the Naqaba system (see paragraphs 65 and 66 of the report for 1931) was again in force. If well administered it should give good results, but the administration is poor and the chances of its being improved are diminished by the existence, side by side with the private owners of companies controlled and managed by the Directorate-General of Finance. In any case, the diminution of the pilgrimage deprives owners, in the absence of strict Government control, of any inducement to keep their rolling- stock up to the mark or to replace worn-out cars. No new vehicles were purchased for the 1932 pilorimage. The difficulties of the private owners were increased by the action of the influential financial interests behind them in arranging with the Naqaba to recover a larger proportion than usual of sums paid for mo or hire, in settlement of old debts. [7721] D 2V v. &lt; 20 91. These facts account for the breakdowns to which the Indian vice-consul refers. He points out that even where relief cars are supposed to be available, as they are in certain cases under the regulations, they are of little use owing to the failure of their drivers to keep time with others. In extreme cases, the journey from Jedda to Mecca has, this year, taken as long as thirty-six hours, and that from Jedda to Medina as long as eight days. 92. The subject of charges is on this occasion dealt with separately in section 9 below. 93. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah cites the following examples of difficulty during the 1932 season (a) A party of six Indian pilgrims, including ladies in bad health, hired a thirteen-seater lorry for their exclusive use on the journey to Medina. When they arrived at the first Koshan station on the return trip, the officer in charge ordered them to convey seven Nejdi soldiers with their kit. After a wrangle of twelve hours with the arbitrary official the pilgrims were compelled to submit and to let the soldiers accompany them throughout the two days of the journey, the discom fort of which was aggravated by the gross conduct of the Nejdis towards ladies accustomed to seclusion and the veil. The pilgrims were too greatly humiliated to disclose all the facts, which were, however, ascertained from the driver, or to make a formal complaint. In these circumstances, the Legation could not make official representations. The matter was brought to the notice of the Director- Oeneral of Finance, who promised to enquire into it, but took no effective action. {h) A party of eighteen important Malabari pilgrims enlisted the assistance of the Indian vice-consul to secure three four-seater and one six-seater touring cars for the journey to Medina. After they had paid their money and been kept waiting for days, an attempt was made to fob them off with Ford vans with hard seats. The Assistant Governor of Jedda hesitated to intervene on discovering that the vans belonged to a Government company, but was persuaded by the vice-consul to arrange for their replacement by touring cars owned by another company. Upon this the manager of the Government company quoted instructions received in the meantime from Mecca that, under the regulations, the vans were to be regarded as touring cars and paid for as such. It was eventually agreed after much difficulty that, as a special concession, the vans should be provided with seat cushions and charged for at the rate for lorries. {c) A deputy-inspector of schools from Bengal, who was returning from Medina by lorry before Pilgrimage Day reported to the Legation from an inter mediate station on the road that he and his party had been compelled to alight and the lorry diverted to other use, with the result that there was a risk of their not reaching Mecca in time. In this case the Legation was able to arrange for other transport. {d) Many pilgrims, including Nawab Fakhar Yar Jung Bahadur, of Hyderabad, were seriously delayed owing to shortage of petrol due to the operation of the regulation against filling tanks at Jedda with more than is required for the outward journey to Mecca. This regulation benefits the munici pality and vendors in Mecca, but drivers are apt to start back with insufficient supplies owing to the high price ruling there, with the result that pilgrims get stuck up in out-of-the-way places. Pilgrims were detained in this way for periods of from eight to thirty-six hours. The gentleman mentioned by name above waited eight hours and then only got on thanks to his being picked up by Khan Bahadur Ihsannullah. (e) Many pilgrims objected to a regulation which requires that each lorry going to Medina should carry a ' sabee,' or mutawwif's assistant. Incon venience was caused by the enforcement of this regulation, whether the lorry already had its full complement of passengers or not. The Legation drew the attention of the Hejazi Government to this, and suggested that it should be optional for pilgrims to take a sabee with them or not, and that sabees accom panying pilgrims should either be included in the complement of passengers or preferably carried in the spare lorries which accompany each caravan to Medina. (/) One case was not primarily a matter of transport except in so far as the last Koshan official on the way to' Medina is responsible for the collection of a, local tax of 11 piastres miri payable by visitors to that place. A retired officer of the Bahawalpur Police Service was delayed for six hours owing to the inability of the officials to compute the sum in local currency to be collected from a partyM' of thirteen persons. 'All the while,' 1 says Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, 'they were quarrelling and quibbling with each other and arriving at different calculations, sometimes closing the office and going away to return a little later.' The pilgrims were amused but fatigued. Koshan has come to be thing of terror. 'The word, to quote the vice-consul again, 'is now synonymous with foreboding evils and dangers for the pilgrims, and Khan Bahadur Lieutenant- Colonel Ziauddin (the officer concerned in the incident described) depicted it to be a word meant to frighten the urchins not to commit any mischief.' 94. On the 25th March His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires brought to the official notice of the Hejazi Government difficulties experienced by pilgrims, including those under heads (b) and (d) above. It was understood that these representations had impressed the King and the Director-General of Finance. On the 13th April an official communique was published stating that, in ■consequence of complaints by pilgrims regarding delay due to the use of defective ears and lack of spare parts, mutawwifs and motor owners had been warned that only serviceable cars, certified as such by the proper authorities, must be used. The communique declared that owners causing delay by negligence in this respect : or by not providing necessary spare parts would be severely punished, and that mutawwifs failing to report such delays would be punished as accomplices. No reply was returned to Mr. Hope Gill's note, but on the 2nd August the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Sir Andrew Ryan, in reply to a formal ! l reminder, that the cases were still under consideration and promised to supply £ information as to the eventual result. 95. When the Indian vice-consul saw the King under the auspices of »■ Ismail Ghuznavi on the 7th May, 1932, His Majesty said that his attention had been drawn to complaints regarding the motor transport service, but that no one e ; bad suggested any effective means of improving it. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah i?. thereupon put forward a series of suggestions as to how conditions might, in his t opinion, be ameliorated. He said that pilgrims were unduly detained at Jedda on their way to Medina for an inspection of vehicles conveying them, which had no material value. This system of inspection should be abolished, and the transport companies should be held responsible for their respective vehicles. The official at the starting-point, as well as at the intermediate stations, should duly record the time of the arrival and departure of the vehicles. There should be a supervising body at the destination, who, on the arrival of the vehicles, would determine whether the driver had plied them at the normal speed, which should be fixed by the Government, and in case of any infraction the delinquent should be punished. This would put a check on irresponsible drivers, who sometimes capsize the vehicles by rash driving and cause serious injuries to pilgrims. Efforts should also be made to instal telephone stations on the Medina road, and the officials at each post should be provided with benzine, water, oil, &amp;c., to be supplied free to any vehicles running short against a receipt by the driver, the amount shown in which should subsequently be recovered from the companies concerned. There should be on the Medina road at least four large stations equipped with all the necessary spare parts for vehicles and served by an engineer with a car at his disposal. On receipt of information that any vehicle had been incapacitated on the road, the engineer should at once proceed to the spot and carry out the necessary repairs, the cost of which would be subsequently recovered from the companies. The existing regulation, which requires the companies to provide at their expense one spare car to accompany each caravan of six cais, should be abolished. The adoption of the suggestions put forward would render this unnecessary, and the cost of maintaining the engineers could all the moie justly be made a charge on the companies, recoverable by the IS aqaba at the end of each season. Spare parts, benzine, &amp;c., supplied on the road should be cnaige for at double the market rate in order to stimulate the sense of responsibility oi the motor companies and make them more careful to equip their vehicles proper y. Should an engineer regard any vehicle on the road as unfit for traffic, he shou c be authorised to replace it by another, and the company should be liable to a ne for providing such a car for the conveyance of pilgrims. Should the establish ment of telephone stations on the Medina road be not considered feasible a practical alternative would be to establish twenty-four pilgrim stations on the Medina road and attach a coffee shop to each, which should cater for all the requirements of pilgrims. The Government should also appom an engmee inspect once a year all vehicles engaged in the pilgrimage traffic, and the companyconcerned should be required to replace any vehicle found to be in an unserviceable condition. Companies should, moreover, be lequired to keep a fixed number of touring cars to cope with the growing demands 01 better class pilgrims. 96. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah states that the King listened to these proposals, some of which seem to His Majesty s Ministei xathei drastic, with rapt attention,' and directed the Director-General of Finance to consider them. It remains to be seen whether they bear any fruit. Their adoption, even in a modified form, would undoubtedly be advantageous. 97. The general use of motor transport on the road between Mecca and Arafat was allowed for the first time in 1932, but the cost was very heavy, as will be seen in section 9 below. Camels. 98. There are no special remarks to make this year. No serious complaints reached the Legation, and Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah considers that pilgrims who used this form of transport were fortunate in being spared the troubles of those who rode in motor vehicles. Arabas or- Cabs. 99. The prohibition against the use of motor cars in Mecca during the height of the pilgrimage season was maintained this year, but less, it would appear, because of congestion in so lean a pilgrimage year than as a concession to the cab owners, a deputation of whom asked for the maintenance of the prohibition in order that they should not lose their customers. The Indian vice-consul saw in this a further hardship, imposed by the Government on pilgrims, many of whom, he says, especially invalids and women, were compelled to walk long distances to their lodgings through inability to pay cab hire. His Majesty's Minister confesses to some sympathy with the dying race of cabmen. (6) Customs. 100. The revision of customs duties effected at the end of 1930 was described in paragraph 85 of the report on last year's pilgrimage. They were still further increased in the autumn of 1931, with the results shown in the following table,, which gives for convenience of reference the effect of the two successive increases as regards the commodities named : — pexar i, Ti Mil Articles.

The raising of the duties twice in rapid succession accentuated the distress among the native population, which is described elsewhere. In some respects it was at the same time disadvantageous to the Treasury, e .g., ^ stimulated the trade in contraband tobacco, with the result that that commodity could be obtained at cheaper rates than before. It did not benefit the employees of the Government, whose hopes of seeing their salaries paid more regularly were disappointed. The Government remained as dilatory as before in paying out- money, and it was popularly supposed that any surplus revenue went to swell the King s personal treasure in Nejd. The Indian vice-consul cites a case in which the local financial administration in Jedda could not sanction the purchase ■JiSCOI ktk h ti h k Not ^eai % I, 1 Sag k froj23 ,of a case of benzine tor the quarantine motor-launch, with the result that the medical officer had to go out to a pilgrim ship in the launch of the shipping: company's agents. &amp; 102. To revert to the proper subject of this section, it has to be recorded that the non-payment of salaries proved a blessing of a kind to pilgrims coming through the custom-houses. The customs officials were very ready to mitigate the severity described in last year's report, and to quote Khan Bahadur Ihsannullah : ' They devoted themselves to the earning of a few riyals to compensate their unpaid state, and in return for the tips they silently passed the bags and baggages ''^1 of the pilgrims. This saved them (the^ pilgrims) the hardships of rigorous searches, involving not only several hours tedious delay, but also loss of and damage to many articles.' 103. These facilities, however illegitimate, seem to have been greatly rioiisf; appreciated by pilgrims generally, but the Indian vice-consul mentions two cases atpi^ of unwillingness to take advantage of them. A member of the Punjab Civil loiJ Service, who refused to give a tip, was made to pay 9 rupees, more than the value of the goods in India, on a small quantity of patent medicine, and protested unsuccessfully against what he considered an extortionate charge. A party of well-to-do merchants from Cape Town, who had eighty trunks and other packages, , rf ( ; expected to pay at least 600 rupees in duty. On being approached secretly by an ^ official, who offered to clear their goods free of duty in return for a tip, they ' ^ refused on the ground that they were on a religious errand . The official thereupon , ^ begged them to help a needy man with a half-starving family. Unable to resist 1 r ■ this appeal they gave him 20 rupees, and their luggage was passed free after a ■ 1 cursory examination. The first of these incidents might have happened in any ' ; country. The second illustrates the pound-foolishness of the Hejazi Government ^ in not paying their officials, but, anyhow, there were no serious complaints this year of hardship being inflicted on pilgrims in the custom-houses. 104. In his recommendation' to the* King on the subject of pilgrimage reform, Ismail Ghuznavi drew attention to the deplorable state of the Customs Administration, the officials of which confront pilgrims with the choice between taking advantage of their venality, to the detriment of the Treasury, and being treated with unreasonable severity if they refuse to lend themselves to corrupt practices. WtlEj (7) Religious Policy. 105. Mention was made in paragraph 94 of the last report of the renewed application of internal measures to enforce stricter compliance with religious K e fl?| principles, and of the reinstatement of the ' Committee of Virtue in the towns. The despatch to the north on military duty of one of the chief exponents of this policy produced a slackening later in the year, and even on his return greater miidnggg continued both in Mecca and Jedda. This is attributed to the penury of those charged with the enforcement of the regulations and their consequent readiness to 'mitigate their rigour in consideration of receiving tips, food supplies, (fee., from members of the public. It is said that the president of the Jedda Committee of Virtue arranged with certain vendors to get rations of food-stuff in exchange for toleration, and devoted himself to photography, even to the extent of posing with the ladies of his family. Nevertheless, an incident occurred early in 1932, when the insistence of the Nejdi soldiers employed by the committee on the attendance at mosque of a 12-year-oid boy led to a clash between the said soldiers and the police, behind two of whom the boy took refuge. Other policemen rallied in some strength to his support or that of their colleagues. An armed conflict was averted by the intervention of higher authority and the affair was liquidated, but not until some physical injuries had been inflicted. 106. The Indian vice-consul mentions, also, the case which arose in the latter part of 1931 of a pious Indian, a harmless devotee, who claimed to have seen the Prophet in a vision, and refused to admit that it was a diabolic visitation. He was deported to Palestine after lying in prison for four months. 107. Pilgrims, however, suffered as a rule no general hardship of a serious M land, owing to religious intolerance in 1932. Those arriving from India were warned by Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah to be prudent in certain respects, e.g., to l[ ,i; refrain from smoking in public. The Khan Bahadur mentions two particular # cases of hardship. A venerated well, within the precincts of the Prophet's tomb at Medina, which had been closed by the Wahabis, was broken open by certain\ i I; i •* ' 1! Il | 24 piWims bv uioriit, and one of them announced next moining tnat it had been opened miraculously. This produced a rush of pilgums to diaw watei, where upon the man was arrested and severely flogged, ihe othei case was that of a Puniabi Sufi named Pir Syed Jamait Ali Shah, who is held m respect by many Moslems throughout India. He comes frequently on pilgi image, and got into trouble in 1931, when he came with many followers, for refusing to pray behind the Wahhabi Imam at Medina. The Indian vice-consul spoke on his behalf to the Governor of Medina during a subsequent visit to that place. During the 1932 pilgrimage the Pir and his followers repeated their defiance, with the result that he and a disciple were summoned before the Governor, who made them sit on the ground, flogged the disciple and threatened the 1 n. Ihc latter got off by apologising, but his Indian supporters were greatly scandalised, and Ismail Ghuznavi had to try and placate him on his arrival at Mecca. 108. Mention has been made in section (1) of the steps taken to restore tombs at Medina, all the principal of which, except two, had been repaired before the Ulema of Nejd protested to the King and extracted a promise that the work would be discontinued. Pilgrims were allowed to visit shrines freely in this place, though it was still necessary to bribe the Nejdi guards in order to be able to kiss the railing of the Prophet's Tomb. A less liberal policy was pursued at Mecca, where pilgrims had to refrain from visiting shrines, and were in some cases beaten and stoned on going to Hira and Jebel Sur. 1 heir feelings are less outraged at Jedda, which is a place of passage, and at Taif which is visited by very few, but the Tomb of Eve, at the former place, is still walled up, and the tomb of Ibn Abbas, at Taif. is hidden from view by walls built all around it. 109. It is thought by some that the greater tolerance now shown in regard to tombs at Medina is due to a desire to make use of the revenue from the heavy road-tax on the journey. Pilgrims have no object in going to Medina unless they can visit the Prophet's tomb and oth^r shrines. 110. There was some trouble at Mount Arafat, where it is usual for Ibn Sand to stand on the mount surrounded by his Nejdis, while others cannot go up to it. Ignorance on the part of certain foreign pilgrims of this discrimination led to incidents in which an Egyptian was flogged and a few Indians were severely wounded. 111. Shia pilgrims again complained of discrimination on grounds of religion. The Legation cannot concern itself with the purely religious grievances of those of British nationality, but it took up a complaint that they were subjected to an extra tax of half a gold pound on the journey to Medina. The Hejazi Government replied that no extra tax was levied, but that the transporters charged for removing and replacing the wooden cover of cars, to which the Shias object on religious grounds. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah adduces strong reasons for disbelieving this explanation, and is convinced that the charge is, in fact, a tax levied for Government account, but the matter has been left in abeyance until next year. 112. Non-Wahhabi Moslems complain of the way in which Shari'a law is applied or misapplied by the courts, but, as the examples cited do not directly concern pilgrims as such, they are omitted from this report. Mention must, however, be made of a remarkable case, in which, some time after the pilgTimage r an Afghan pilgrim was condemned to death by a specially constituted tribunal for having stolen a piece of the Black Stone and a fragment of the cover of the Kaaba. The extreme sentence is understood to have been executed. The case caused much scandal among moderate men. 113. It may be deduced from the foregoing account that Ibn Sand's policy in these matters remains as strongly Wahhabi as is consistent with the economic and financial necessity of not choking off pilgrims, and that, in his efforts at compromise, he is sometimes hampered by religious opinions even more extreme than his own, especially that of the Ulema of Nejd, whom, however, he sometimes overrides. A striking instance of this is afforded by a recent utterance of these ulema, in which they quote him, with obvious misgiving, but without open dissent, as having told them that the question of the Egyptian Mahmal was one of administration and policy, meaning that it was in his domain. For the rest, be naturally favours foreign Wahhabis, receiving in audience and bestowing gifts on such persons, even when they are otherwise of little account. Financial stringency continues to limit the scope for Wahhabi propaganda abroad, but it is not altogether neglected. Books and pamphlets are distributed among pilgrims of IP it ^ (tltf ]\ tafl ic( icurt (t), Ijnce- 1 fifs ulmgw. lofth ill to eso pifs, fcasb is-W [itta ftkin Hi, T iir His 1 A slhctii IS, T keou A isi inage, fetood t 'ibee 11, T StsinJe h dij SteikL tro %to T V •Sik ''•'pildifferent nationalities, and Ismail Ghuznavi is said to have received this year £150 for the specific purpose of publishing and distributing Wahhabi literature. (8) Mutawwifs. 114. Much attention was given in the pilgrimage reports for 1930 and 1931 to the mutawwif system, and to the causes which have hitherto defeated the hopes of reform conceived when Ibn Saud took over the Hejaz. The section must be slightly curtailed this year in order to make room for that which follows. 115. The reform proposals discussed in Hejazi circles last year (see paragraphs 105 and 106 of the last report) produced no definite effect in time for the 1932 pilgrimage. The matter is still, however, engaging the attention of the King, who has on certain occasions expressed public disapproval of the exploitation of pilgrims by his Hejazi subjects, high and low (see paragraph 19 above). The Director-General of Finance has shown interest in the views of the Indian vice-consul, and many Indian pilgrims, including Ismail Ghaznavi, have presented reforms to His Majesty. 116. Meanwhile, the Legation black-list has proved a salutary check on mutawwifs concerned with Indian pilgrims. As it does not extend to the underling whom the mutawwifs send to India, it was reinforced in 1932 by the action of the Indian vice-consul in warning pilgrims on board arriving ships against being deluded into employing undesirables, and furnishing them with the names of recommended mutawwifs. This was a further lesson to the bad mutawwifs, but it caused some little trouble with high Hejazi personages. The Governor of Jedda was approached with a view to preventing Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah from going aboard the incoming ships, and promised to do something to restrain his activities, but did not do it. The Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs asked that action on board ship should not be taken in respect of one black-listed mutawwif in whom he was interested. In this case partial satisfaction was given to Fuad Bey Hamza, for reasons of policy, by suspending the action in the case of the last two ships. 117. The net result was that in 1932 mutawwifs showed greater anxiety than heretofore to placate the Indian vice-consul. Fewer cases of difficulty arose and disputes were more easily adjusted, in many cases by the efforts of Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, to compose them in a manner satisfactory to both parties. 118. A revised black-list was sent to India in August 1932. The Government of India have, on their side, introduced legislation to control more effectively the activities of undesirables in that country. It may be hoped that parallekaction at both ends will have a salutary effect. 119. The former head sheikh of the mutawwifs in charge of Indian and miscellaneous pilgrims at Mecca was dismissed last year, but was replaced by an equally unsatisfactory successor. The latter was dismissed after the 1932 pilgrimage, and the post has not been filled up to the time of writing. It is understood that the King has decided to comply with the demand made in many quarters for a separate head sheikh for Indian pilgrims. This will be a great boon, provided he chooses a person qualified by linguistic knowledge, &amp;c., to cater for their needs. r 120. The Legation cannot exert the same direct influence on mutawwifs agents in Jedda that it can in the case of mutawwifs themselves. Some influence can, however, in present circumstances, be brought to bear by inducing mutawwifs, who are anxious to please, not to give their agencies to persons of whom the Legation disapproves. It still remains an object of policy to limit the agents responsible for Indian pilgrims to the business of Indian pilgrims only. This also has been recommended to the King. It might incidentally have the advantage of diminishing the risk of Soviet propaganda among pilgrims. One of the persons who holds mixed agencies is said to be a secret agent of the Russian Legation, His conduct has been otherwise open to objection, and certain mutawwiis concerned with Indian pilgrims were this year induced to withdraw then agencies from him. Another agent, faced with a similar possibility, showed a tendency to reform and to make good losses inflicted by him on pilgrims. 121. The Taqrir svstem has not been extended, but is viewed with increasing resentment by those subject to it, and various pilgrims, among t era Sardar Suleiman Kassira Mitba, have appealed to the King to abons i . e Malabar pilgrims have at least the choice between two rautawwifs enjoying a [7721] E28 joint monopoly, on© of whom is on tlic British Indi&amp;n blfick list, 'while the otliBr, who is now mostly chosen by the pilgrims in accordance v\ ith the Indian vice-consul s advice, is innocuous. The iVIemon community ha\e no choice, and have made strong efforts of late to secure the same freedom of choice as the majority of pilgrims. The Legation sympathises with this desire, but could only intervene in favourable circumstances and with great discretion. 122. The obnoxious regulation enacted in April 1931 to enable mutawwifs to impound the passes of pilgrims (see paragraph 102 of the last report) was rescinded in the autumn. A new system was introduced m 1932, under which each pilgrim was required to obtain a certificate from the head sheikh of mutawwifs authorising his departure. Ihe loss of these certificates on the journey caused inconvenience in many cases. Pilgrims were again not allowed to embark unless their passes had been stamped by the mutawwifs' agents in Jedda. 123. As in 1931 (see paragraph 107 of the previous report), a good many pilgrims were unable to pay their mutawwifs dues, but no serious difficulty arose, as the Director-General of Finance showed readiness to arrange for them to be allowed to depart at the direct request of the Indian vice-consul. 124. In a letter dated the 3rd February, 1932, the Legation drew the attention of the Commissioner of Police, Bombay, to the conduct of certain mutawwifs and others who persuade pilgrims in India to advance money to them on loan and to the difficulty experienced by the pilgrims in subsequently recovering the amounts. Two specific complaints, both against the same mutawwif, had been made, and it was believed that the practice was frequent. When the letter reached Bombay the particular mutawwif involved had already left, but steps were taken to warn intending pilgrims against lending money to any mutawwif or Hejazi subject. It is hoped that all pilgrimage authorities in India will note the possibility of the abuse and take action to warn pilgrims afresh as each pilgrimage season approaches. 125. Some anxiety was caused to the Legation by a communique published by the Hejazi Government on the 6th November, 1931, prescribing that no sale of return tickets by pilgrims should be effected except in the presence of the head sheikh of mutawwifs and/or a committee, before whom the buyer and seller should appear to have the sale duly authenticated and registered, Mutawwifs, &amp;c., responsible for the sale of return tickets in any other way were threatened with severe penalties. Although the regulation was intended to check abuses, it appeared, nevertheless, to give legal sanction to the sale of return tickets, contrary to the strongly held views of British authorities and shipping companies. The matter was taken up with the Central Government at the instance of the Legation by the Governor of Jedda, who was interested also as being the principal local shipping agent. A decision was obtained that the arrangements prescribed in the communique did not apply to the tickets of Indian pilgrims, which were not transferable. 126. On the 30th November the Hejazi Government addressed a circular to the foreign missions, asking that their nationals coming to the Hejaz as pilgrims should be warned to obtain receipts from mutawwifs or the mutawwifs' agents for money or other property deposited with them. The circular explained that the competent authorities had been instructed to see that this rule was strictly observed. The matter was in due course dealt with in a communique issued by the Indian Department of Education, Health and Lands on the 21st^ January, 1932, the material part of which stated 'that the Government of the Hejaz have instituted an arrangement under which pilgrims, who wish to do so, can deposit their money or other property with their mutawwifs or their agents, in return for receipts signed by them. Pilgrims who take advantage of the arrangement should take care to see that they receive their receipts, duly signed.'' This wording appeared to the Legation' to convey a different sense from that of the warning and to constitute in some sort an encouragement to deposit money, &amp;c., with mutawwifs. The Government of India did not share this view and rejected a suggestion that publicity should be given to the actual language of the Hejazi Government's circular. In practice, it is a convenience for pilgrims to deposit their heavy luggage with their mutawwifs, but it is as undesirable that they should entrust money or valuables to them in the Hejaz as that they should advance money to them in India (see paragraph 124).27 d ::&gt; i CfffJ' 127. The Indian vice-consul was stirred to indignation by a request from the Hejazi Government, on behalf of the heirs of a deceased mutawwif, that a sum claimed as having been due to him by a deceased pilgrim should be repaid by the Legation out of the estate of the latter, which had already been handed over to it. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah saw in this an extension of the rapacitv of the mutawwifs to a region beyond the grave. It was perhaps a more legitimate objection that no documentary evidence was produced in support of the claim, and that it related to dues which, in the view of the Legation, could not have accrued, as the pilgrim had died in Medina before going to Mecca {compare paragraph 145 below). Fortunately, the estate had already been forwarded to India. The Hejazi Government were informed that this would make it difficult to comply with the request, and their attention was drawn, moreover, to the doubtfulness of the claim on the two grounds stated above. 128. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah holds no brief for mutawwifs. He. nevertheless, draws attention to the fact that, while many pilgrims, e.g., the bulk of the Bengalis, fall entirely under their influence and will either lay complaints against them or refuse to confirm in their presence complaints made privately, some pilgrims of the easier class make extravagant demands. He cites the case of an Indian pilgrim of some eminence who came to the Hejaz in 1932 with a party of twenty. This gentleman, after putting his mutawwif to great extra trouble and expense for services in addition to those to which the pilgrim is entitled, rewarded the man with his bare legal due for the services normally rendered and an abundance of complaint. 129. Incidentally, pilgrims of this fortunately rare description cause much trouble to the Legation, not only in connexion with their mutawwifs, but in other ways. The gentleman just mentioned, for instance, on one occasion asked the Legation doctor to go to his house at a late hour. The visit was arranged with much difficulty owing to the restrictions on motor cars in the town, which made it necessary for Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah to take the doctor to the pilgrim's quarters in his own car. It was ascertained after all this pother that the case was that of a servant suffering from a mild attack of fever; and, says the Khan Bahadur with just indignation, 'It greatly annoyed the Indian vice- consul, who felt constrained to disapprove this action of this gentleman for creating a tempest in the teapot at the late hours of the night.' 130. The vice-consul cites another case, not strictly relevant to this section, in which he and an Indian driver were the victims of the unreasonableness of a young gentleman occupying a minor clerical post in India. This lad was so puffed up at having a letter of recommendation from an influential relative, that he produced an eleven-page complaint in Urdu about some trivial incident of placing in a car and threatened the Khan Bahadur with dire consequences if it were not attended to. The difference between him and his driver was composed only with great difficulty. 131. It^is important that pilgrims of standing should realise that there are many things for which mutawwifs cannot justly be blamed, and that unreasonable complaints, especially at the height of the season, merely waste the time of the pilgrimage officers of the Legation, whose duty it is to attend to the legitimate interests of all classes of pilgrims. (9) Pilgrimage Tariff and Cost of Pilgrimage. 132. As stated in paragraph 98 of the report for 1931, the tariff of charges authorised by the Hejazi Government for the 1932 pilgrimage was published at an unusually early date. As before, transport charges were left to be fixed later, but, according to information obtained by the Indian vice-consul, it was not expected that these would be materially different in 1932 from those ruling in 1931. It was therefore possible for the Legation to draw up early in the autumn of 1931 a tentative estimate of what it would cost an ordinary Indian pilgrim to make the Haj in 1932. This estimate, in which all expenditure was shown in rupees, was printed as an appendix to the pilgrimage report for 1931, and was also sent to India as an enclosure in a separate paper. In the pilgrimage report,, the final form of which was delayed, a warning (see paragraph 156 of that report) was inserted drawing attention to the fact that the estimate had been prepared before the abandonment by Great Britain of the gold standard, an event which was bound to affect greatly the exchange rates which had been used in drawing it up. [7721] e 2133. Considerable publicity was given in India to the Legation estimate, and/or another adopted by the Government of Bengal which dinered fiom it only in minor details. The danger of confusion as to the enect on it 01 the dislocation of the exchange rates was aggravated by another circumstance, namely, that the charges in the authorised tariff had been, as in previous years, stated in four currencies, viz., Egyptian piastres for (quarantine dues, pounds for the amount payable to mutawwifs by Javanese pilgiuns, mpees for the amounts similarly pavable to mutawwifs by Indians, and piastres mm, i .6., offici&amp;l Heiazi piastres for all other items in the tariff. Moreover, as the event showed, the use of the denomination ' piastres miri carried with it a further possibility of confusion. The Hejazi currency has in theory a double basis, the English gold pound (formerly indistinguishable from sterling) and the silver riyal, which had been legally pegged to the pound at the rate of 10 riyals = l pound gold= 110 piastres miri. Eut early in 1931 some months before and independently of the gold-sterling crisis, the riyal had broken away from its legal parity, with the result that the expression 'piastre miri had acquired two distinct meanings, according to whether it meant the 1/110 fraction of a gold pound or the 1/11 fraction of a silver riyal. The exchange rates shown for the end of the year 1931 in paragraph 11 of this report were the resultant of the combined factors. 134. The full effect of the dislocation of exchanges occurring after its estimate of the cost of the pilgrimage had been circulated did not become apparent to the Legation until the first Indian pilgrim ship arrived in Jedda at the end of December. The first charges encountered by the arriving pilgrims are some of those stated in piastres miri, and although pilgrims from India could not expect their rupees to have the same gold value as formerly, it remained to be seen whether they could compensate their loss on the rupee by buying riyals with which to make the piastre miri payments. The mutawwifs' agents insisted on them being paid on a gold basis and claimed to have the authority of the Govern ment to do so. It was a question whether the same principle could not be applied to payments stated in the tariff in rupees; and the Government had still not announced the authorised rates for transport. In order to elucidate the whole obscure situation, His Majesty's Minister, after some preliminaries, wrote officially to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 2nd January. He drew attention to four things which threatened to upset the calculations on which pilgrims had been working, viz. : — {a) The refusal of the mutawwifs' agents to accept Hejazi silver in payment of charges stated in piastres miri. {h) The imposition of four charges not included in the tariff. (c) Rumours that the charges for transport were to be heavily increased. id) Rumours that mutawwifs could not accept payment in rupees of the charges stated in the tariff in that currency. Sir Andrew Ryan enquired as to the position in regard to {a) and {h); urged the Ministry to communicate to him a list of all transport charges; and asked for confirmation of his assumption that rupees could be accepted in payment of charges stated in that currency. 135. Although the Minister impressed the importance of the matter orally on Fuad Bey Hamza at least twice in the ensuing ten or twelve days, it was not until the 17th January that the latter replied officially. He then communicated a notice which had been published in the '' Umm-al-Qura '' two days earlier, and added a denial that the pilgrims could be charged anything outside the tariff, ' except the transport charge which is to be fixed in due course.' This denial had to be read in the light of the sanction given in the notice for two of the charges referred to at (h) above, amounting together to 3 piastres miri. For the rest, the effect of the notice was that all tariff charges, no matter in what currency stated, must be paid on a gold basis; that is to say, piastres miri on the basis of 110 piastres = one gold pound; amounts in Egyptian currency on the basis of the pre-sterling-crisis value of that currency; and rupees on the basis of a con ventional rate of 13^ rupees = one gold pound, which the Hejazi Government had recognised in the past. The effect can be best seen by a concrete example. In P e tariff for 1932 the mutawwif's personal charge for the majority of Indian pilgrims had been fixed at 40 rupees as compared with 54 rupees in 1931, ^ reduction intended to attract pilgrims. Under the decision of January 1932 this charge of 40 rupees could not be paid by tendering that amount in Indian Bidfbi iljaz. taiid tl iiirevE I En ait c |a k i to tie ■ill cost % iisci id'sC iGwei la wstof till 1,1 Wa Niies k %29 i e( |i' currency. At the conventional rate recognised by the Government it worked out ftlif, approximately £3 gold, and, if paid in rupees, it meant that the pilgrim would ;( : r have to pay the equivalent of that amount of gold, say 57 rupees, or if the rupee ;. depreciated as it was likely to do with the influx of pilgrims, about 60 rupees. ' 136. Assuming the correctness of the two original bases of the Legation's 0 u A estimate of the probable cost of the pilgrimage, i.e., the tariff charges converted at JN the rates of exchange ruling in the summer of 1931, and the expectation that the still unfixed transport charges could not differ substantially in gold from those ^ levied during the previous season, it became a mere question of arithmetic to , ''N determine the effect of the Hejazi Government's decision. It was clear that, ■ subject to slight variations resulting from minor changes in transport charges and the possibility of some economy to meet the hardness of the times, the cost j' of the pilgrimage, reckoned in rupees, from the moment of landing at Jedda to that of re-embarking must be about 40 per cent, greater than in 1931. Sir Andrew NW Ryan informed the Government of India by telegraph on the 18th January that 'tacliJ he now reckoned the average Indian pilgrim's probable expenditure in the Hejaz Nil at about 800 rupees, or a little less, if economy was practised. He took steps to endefl acquaint other interested British authorities also with the facts and his ifodi deductions from them. He informed Fuad Bey orally on the 20th January of wiigi the conclusion he had reached. iidili 137. The Government of India published, on the 23rd January, a dm communique, based on Sir Andrew Ryan's telegram of the 18th January, from nofc which they deduced that the total cost of the pilgrimage would be about India';;; 1,100 rupees. In one respect the communique left room for an important remit;: misconception, as it suggested that the Hejazi Government were themselves the la rati authors of Sir Andrew Ryan's revised estimate of 800 rupees for expenditure mtsK: m the Hejaz. This may have helped to aggravate the controversy which presently ofII arose, and the burden of which had to be sustained by Mr. Hope Gill, as 1 not It ill Andrew Ryan was called away from Jedda on the 2nd February. I y ,■ 138. Every effort was made to discredit the estimate published by the itet'r Government of India. The Hejazi Minister in London complained that it was 1]!lffl ;- excessive. Ismail Ghaznavi published in India the reply to an enquiry addressed n . J by him to the Hejazi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, from which he deduced that the total cost of the pilgrimage need not be moi'e than 750 rupees in spite of everything. The President of the Haj Committee at Karachi, committed the grave indiscretion of broadcasting in India a telegram from an officer of veriiw Ibn Saud's Court, sent apparently in reply to a direct enquiry, denying that the Hejazi Government were parties to the estimate of 1,100 rupees, or that there was any increase in charges. The whole telegram inferred, though it did not jiffiM state, that the estimate was exaggerated. rupfc 139. The Hejazi Government cannot be acquitted of bad faith. They would have been justified in contesting the Legation's figures, but not in trading, as they did, on the half truth that the 1931 charges had not been increased. Stated in jJ gold, they had neither been lowered nor materially increased: converted into : : rupees, they were obviously higher than in 1931 by the equivalent of the 111 ''' | depreciation of the rupee in terms of gold. Mr. Hope Gill was at enormous pains to place the matter in a true light in an en clair telegram to the Government of India and in correspondence with the He^azi Government. On the 16th March the Government of India published a second communique, in which they rebutted the aspersions cast on the first. They gave it as their conclusion that, if a pilgrim performed all his journeys in the Hejaz by camel and without luggage, and ^ practised the most rigid economy, he might be able to perform the pilgrimage at a ; total cost of 900 rupees, but that, in no other circumstances, would the cost be for*, less than 1,100 rupees. There is reason to believe that, although the Hejazi # ■ propaganda in India had produced some effect between^ the dates of^ the two communiques, the second deterred pilgrims still awaiting embarkation from oflt- starting with wholly insufficient means. ;!#: 140. It was not until the 2nd March that the Hejazi Government iasi ; : communicated to the Legation an official list of transport charges. They were .(#; given as rates which might be affected by the laws of supply and demand, but ■0^; which were in any case maxima. Three days later Fuad Bey corrected two slight '\[\errors. It was found later that in certain cases higher rates were being actually iee sii charged. On the 22nd March the Minister for Foreign Affairs submitted that the jujffl*; motor companies had been allowed to exceed the maxima previously allowed30 owing to increased duty on benzine and spare parts. Mr. Hope Gill then drew up a table of what he understood to be the final rates, .and. on the 24th March, asked the Minister to confirm it. He received no reply, despite various efforts to extract one. 141. It is difficult, for various reasons, to make an exact comparison between the inclusive fares finally charged m 1932 and those charged in 1931, Broadly speaking, the rates for motor transport as finally fixed for the height of the season would appear to have been from 10 to 20 per cent, higher in gold than those of the previous year, and those for camels much about the same. The principal inclusive figures deduced by Mr. Hope Gill from the correspondence were as follows :— Jedda to Mecca by motor lorry (same for return) : 132 piastres miri. Jedda to Mecca by touring car (same for return) : 187 piastres miri. Mecca to Medina and back by lorry : £12 plus 48J piastres miri. Mecca to Medina and back by car : £15 plus 48| piastres miri. Jedda to Mecca by camel ; 70 piastres. Mecca to Jedda by camel : 100 piastres. Mecca to Medina and back by camel : £5J plus 107 piastres. Mecca to Arafat by camel : £ii. These rates are all the charge per person. There was some confusion regarding the last item, as Mr. Hope Gill was told by Fuad Bey on the 5th March that it was for a camel which might carry one, two or three persons, but eventually the amount was charged for each pilgrim. As stated elsewhere, general permission was given this year for pilgrims to make the journey to Arafat by car. Tlie charges for this were not included in the list sent to the Legation on the 2nd March, and were apparently arbitrary. Pilgrims bargained as best they could with motor owners, and prices ranged from £10 to £15 per lorry, plus a Government tax of £10 on each lorry and £5 on each touring car. 142. It must be remembered that a great proportion of the inclusive charges for transport represent Government taxation. This is normally the road-tax known as Koshan, but there has been a growing tendency to slip in other imposts, ihus, one of the extra tariff charges complained of at (b) in paragraph 134 above was a sum of 22 piastres miri for permission to proceed to Mecca. It was not one of those stated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in January to have been sanctioned after the drawing up of the tariff, but it proved afterwards to have been included in the fare. It is certain that the Hejazi Government were determined to get as much as possible out of pilgrims, and were greatly upset when, after they had held out the attraction of a Friday Haj, it was suggested that the cost of the pilgrimage would be so high that it might be a deterrent. Their propaganda against the Legation estimate was definitely misleading. That estimate may possibly have been open to criticism in detail, but it was certainly fair, having regard to the necessity for taking account of all items, including sea transport, officially sanctioned charges of all kinds, and, an element which can by no means be ignored, expenditure on voluntary objects which appeal to nearly all pilgrims, such as the purchase of pious souvenirs, charity, journeys to outlying shrines, ^ 7 cr ^ ce . 0 ^ an i m ^ls, special prayers, &amp;c. Not all of these objects are approved by Wahhabism, but for the majority of pilgrims they contribute greatly to the grace of the pilgrimage. It came to the knowledge of the Legation that Ismail Ghaznavi, while defending in public a total estimate of 750 rupees, advised certain pilgrims in private to set out with the 1,100 rupees recommended bv the Government of India. &amp; came insufficiently provided with funds naturally sunered hardships. Some who might have used conveyances, walked. Some cut out the journey to Medina. Pilgrims of the better class had to content themselves with inferior accommodation in the insanitary conditions which characterise that class of accommodation both m Jedda and Mecca. Those who could affoi d to get further remittances from India were put to considerable expenditure on telegrams, charges for Hundis and the like. 144. Although the matter has been considered above, with reference mainly to Indian pilgrims, those of other nationalities coming from countries where currency had moved with sterling were similarly affected. The Egyptian Government published a warning in January. See also paragraph 206 below as regards Ma ayan pilgrims, and paragraph 239 as regards the great run on deposits made by Palestinian pilgrims. 'Hill ra %. few ■ ll ' in' 14 :0. Good has come out of all this evil. The Hejazi Government were undoubtedly much impiessed by what had happened. It wa&amp; understood that the question of pilgrimage tariff was one of those referred to the Dutch financial .adviser (see paiagraph 4) for examination. Anyhow, the Government have iust published at the time of writing (August 1932) the tariff for the 1933 pilgrimage. It covers a much wider range of items than any preceding tariff, and includes details of transport charges. All charges are shown in piastres miri payable at gold rate, fhe new tariff has not yet been fully studied, and cannot be further dealt with in this report. It is hoped to circulate to all British authorities concerned, not later than October, the text of the tariff and an estimate of the probable cost of next year's pilgrimage based on it. The situation has been so changed by this development that His Majesty's Minister thinks it unnecessary to prolong this already long section by describing in detail certain minor grievances which engaged attention during the 1932 season in connexion with the computation of fares to Medina, excess charges for the return journey in the case of pilgrims staying more than a short time at that place, and' the collection of Mecca mutawwifV clues in advance from persons who wish to go to Medina only, as some do in the off season and even during the Haj period, or who go to Medina before proceeding to Mecca. hM: I' (10) Indian Pilgrimage.

''5 148. The above table shows that the total number of pilgrims from British , India, the Native States and Ceylon was 9,503, as against 7,292 last year. The difference was mainlv due to the increase in the number of pilgiims fiom thePunjab, Bombay, Sind and the Central Provinces, of whom there were 2,039, 1,787, 795 and 639 respectively, as compared with 1,551, 1,0/2, 349 and 318 last year. All other provinces also showed an increase, except the Lnited Provinces and Madras, which sent respectively 922 and 311, as compared with 1 ,083 and 392 last year. The increase in the total number of Indian pilgrims was unexpected, in view of general depression prevailing in India. It may be attributed to the publicity given by the Hejazi Government to the promise of a Friday Haj, to other forms of propaganda, and to the prospect which was held out of reduced costs of pilgrimage. The 1932 Haj was even more remarkable than that of 1931 for the large number of well-to-do and distinguished pilgrims, who came from different parts of India. 149. The following list shows the number of non-Indian pilgrims who travelled to the Hejaz via Indian ports : — Nationality. Bombay. Karachi. Calcutta. Total. Chinese (Turkestan) ... 91 985 1,076 Afghans 115 1,518 1,633 South Africans 1 1 Russians (Turkestan) ... 12 13 25 Persians 12 45 57 Hejaz-Nejd subjects ... 200 118 14 332 Malayans 22 22 Miscellaneous 13 2 ... 15 466 2,681 14 3,1610 lies 0 0 0 li.3 It,5.3 !o,w Ji3 liSJ Jilt ( 1 ) See note I 1 ) (1) to paragraph 147 above. Sliirr 150. Pilgrims in the above category were more numerous by 1,038 than last year, when their number was 2,123. Afghans and Chinese from Turkestan were mainly responsible for the increase, numbering 1,633 and 1,076 respectively, as compared with 597 and 789 of last year. The number of Russians from 1 urkestan rose from seventeen last year to twenty-five. Although the total number of pilgrims from South Africa, most of whom are Indians resident there, showed an increase, only one came via India, as compared with forty in 1931. No Russians from Bokhara came via India. 151. Besides the pilgrims shown in the above table, there was also a small number of Indian pilgrims who came to the Hejaz via Iraq, Egypt, &amp;c. According to information obtained this year from the mutawwifs the number of Indians coming in this way from other than Indian ports was as follows Suez Port Sudan Beyrouth Massawa Aden ...

Almost all of them were indigent and had to be eventually repatriated at the expense of the Government of India. 152. Only one line, the Mogul (Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co.), was engaged in the traffic from and to India this year. Some difficulty arose over a small number of persons, still in the Hejaz, who had come with return tickets of the Nemazee line last year. The local agents of Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co. again showed unwillingness to carry them, but an arrangement similar to that recorded in paragraph 122 of last year's report was eventually made. f u P ^ble shows the movement of return traffic with details ot tne number of ships available on given dates for the repatriation of pilgrims,.33 the number of repatriated. 18 1 at % ta, ' 11 pilgrims awaiting repatriation and the number actually Return Traffic to India.

( 2 ) This figure falls short by 41o of the number of pilgrims shown as having arrived. Lhe discrepancy is partly accounted for by 125 deaths in the Hejaz, but this number is more than set off by the fact that the returning pilgrims included some 207 who had come overland to the Ilejaz and were repatriated by sea as destitutes as well as pilgrims left over from last vear. The number of pilgrims who time arrived by sea in 1932, but have not so far leturned, can better be ga of writing about 500 return tickets are still held in deposit at the Leg'i auged by the fact that at the ation. 155. The following table shows the distribution of the totals given in the preceding paragraph by ports of embarkation and destination. The number of arrivals at Bombay and Karachi, cannot, however, be vouched for, as some pilgrims, booked as passengers for Bombay, subsequently prefer to land at Karachi rather than continue the sea voyage.

The restrictive policy adopted by the authorities in India this year undoubtedly did much to keep the number of destitutes to be repatriated within what may be considered reasonable limits, having regard to the increased cost of the pilgrimage and the large numbers of poor people attracted by the Friday Haj. Return of Pilgrims to India: General. 159. No Indian pilgrims holding return tickets were detained beyond the regulation period of twenty-five days, but the limit was only just observed in the case of about 243 pilgrims, who were detained in Jedda for twenty-four days, prior to embarkation in the steamship ' Alavi,' which sailed on the 22nd June. This was the only case, apart, of course, from the usual destitutes, in which the Legation was seriously troubled with applications for relief and assistance. 160. Some anxiety was caused in the third week in April by a report that Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co. proposed to charter to the Khedivial Line, for the transport of Egyptian pilgrims, the steamship 'Jehangir,' which was at that time the only Mogul ship in port. The facts were not very clear, and the arrangement, if contemplated, was abandoned either before or after Mr. Hope Gill had written a letter to the Mogul agents on the 25th April drawing attention to the large number of Indian pilgrims who were awaiting embarkation. It is suggested that the Government of India should consider the best means of guarding against the diversion of Indian pilgrim ships until the bulk of the returning pilgrims have been disposed of. The Indian vice- consul suggests that it should be prohibited by legislation. His Majestys Minister doubts whether so drastic a remedy is feasible or necessary. 161. Difficulties again arose this year over the shortage of first and second- class accommodation in returning ships for the ever-increasing number of better-class pilgrims (see paragraphs 130 and 134 of last year's report). No less than sixty-two persons preferred to travel home as deck passengers rather than wait. Certain others availed themselves of other means of getting back to India, in spite of their having return tickets by the Mogul Line. Thus two parties of nineteen and thirty-four respectively booked fresh passages by German ships, a party of twenty-two proceeded via Port Sudan and about forty -two persons by way of Aden. 162. The Government of India have concurred in the view of the Legation that it would be difficult, in view of the arrangements at present in force for ookmg return passages in strict rotation, and for other reasons, to allow first and second-class pilgrims to book their passages by letter or telegram from I Slii ffilurne ifat imp at ifs crew It tlem i ffiprok i Eve sir retur: mi id for i btliei ^lena ^cabin, rnBs ME L le ^ *iforl93i * tiai t lead i iaimti]] Wfrie '•ftinif •lie in if lie A' to i h l3l Hi 66111111 TiSo &amp; Mecca or Medina in order, at least, to spare them the disagreeableness of waiting 1 m 9«rt U M ?r ed the au ^ ors of the Abdul Latif-Kadri memorial T 1 !, . . - ey ™ el ' e . exploring the means of achieving the obiect. IS They hau- been m communication with Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co S regarding a new general suggestion that special steamers with extra cabin 82 accommodation should be run. J „ t 1 j 3 ' A -f tni m0re suggestion, the adoption of which would affect S all Jii'Jian pi grims, emerged this year from the consideration of paragraph 10 3j of the aj . nqun y Committee s report, which dealt with the defective accommodation for pilgrims m Jedda. It was decided in India that, in present 55 conditions expenditure^ could not be incurred by the Government on any kind of Musafirkhane and that it would be undesirable to issue an appeal for funds. HL The Standing Committee of the Indian Legislature, however, raised the question of 4 ? u er cor ^ estlon u ] might not be reduced by increasing steamer services and by inducing pilgrims to stay at Mecca or Medina until shipping was available, instead of pioceeding to Jedda immediately after the pilgrimasre It I, is an admirable suggestion that shipping services should be increased if' this i; can be arranged in India, but the other suggestion seems to the Legation, || facie, to be impracticable for many reasons. As the letter from the Government | of India was received only in July, a detailed examination must be reserved ^ for a separate report to them. i 164 rn Ships' officers generally complied loyally with an order issued bv Messrs. I urner, Morrison and Co. on the 14th November. 1931, prohibitinp* them imik; fiom letting theii cabins to first and second-class passengers for whom ordinary /fill! passenger accommodation was not available. It, however, came to notice that at least one restaurateur on board ship was letting privately second-class cabin accommodation placed at his disposal. On this case being reported, the master of the ship at once recovered tne money charged and refunded it to the companv. a measure which produced a salutary effect. The masters also dealt effectively with some few petty complaints against crews in connexion with space on the upper deck. More serious trouble continues to arise from the fact that members of ships' crews rope off parts of the space in the poop reserved for their use ^ and let them out to pilgrims. It would be a great advantage if this practice jiistw also was prohibited. 1 foitE 165 Everything possible is still done to avoid breaches in the system Nttj whereby return passengers are booked in rotation (see paragraph 130 of the nffl! report for 1931). On one occasion this year the Indian vice-consul had to resist is torn a demand for preferential treatment for no less than twenty-eight Royal guests. a term which is apt to be extended to persons of no particular distinction who by3if: have enjoyed the King's consideration. iffe 166. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah mentions another small matter which gives trouble to the ships' agents and to himself, namely, the competition for the one Doj.f cabin on the navigation deck. On one occasion this year three Nawabs struggled befii for this cabin, each seeking to engage influence. The agent, nonplussed, left it the it to the Khan Bahadur, and the Khan Bahadur had to play the role of Paris. ogifiE 167. Difficulty again arose this year owing to the belief of pilgrims that si# the y could draw in Jedda on money deposited in India to cover possible [grinifc quarantine dues in Iraq. The difficulty is explained in paragraph 132 of the (0, report for 1931. 0 168. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah found himself at loggerheads this year # t ^ e fi rm representing the Mogul line, who was also Governor firstt Jedda until his death on the 24th August, 1932. Although the late Governor ijil# w ^ s a good friend of the Legation, his dual capacity enabled him to take action 0# . ich sometimes seemed arbitrary. On one occasion in March he wished to )a#$ ! 1 f 1St on ^ immediate landing of a shipload of pilgrims, who arrived late in j-jf; the afternoon, despite the confusion and discomfort that would have arisen owing [\t' • !r lighting on the quay. The difficulty was overcome and the pilgrims f ld not land until next morning. A more serious matter arose at the end of ''Li ^P r il owing to the apparent inability of the agents to supply information regarding the date of arrival of the ' Rizwani'' until the morning of her arrival. A subsidiary difficulty arose out of this owing to the competing considerations; 1 that a large number of deck pilgrims were ready for shipment, while there was e tr - r num ^ er of better-class pilgrims, who had been waiting at Mecca and Medina and who could not be notified in good time of the opportunity to saiL [7721 ! f 236 The merits of this particular case are varied, but it is clearly desirable that notice should be given to all concerned as early as possible of the appioximate date on which ships intended to embark pilgrims for India may be expected to reach Jedda. It is hard to believe that at least a week's notice cannot be given, and it is hoped that some arrangement with this object will be made with Messrs, Turner, Morrison and Co. 169. The authorities in India are considering an arrangement by which a fixed charge to cover landing and re-embarkation at Jedda should be collected with the fare by the shipping company, who would then be responsible for transport from deck to quay-side and vice versa on the return. It is an important desideratum in this connexion that the dhowmen should not board ships, and that the company should provide a sufficient number of coolies to handle luggage on board ship. 170. An unfortunate accident occurred on board the steamship ' Khosru,' which sailed from Jedda on the 14th May. Mr. Rashid Uddin Hussein, an Indian pilgrim and a Government pensioner, later appointed to a post in the State of Jaipur, slipped overboard, while looking for his luggage. He struck against a dhow and fell into the sea. He was subsequently brought on board, but did not survive. The accident was due to the fact that the ship s crane was in use for loading pilgrims' luggage and the side rails of the ship had been removed. Other pilgrims on board expressed doubt as to the necessity for removing the side rails in ships crowded with passengers in order to carry on the work of loading and unloading by cranes. Apart from this disputable point, there was no question of culpable negligence, and the shipping agents have undertaken that all necessary precautions will be taken in future. 171. Attention having been drawn by authorities in India to the fact that pilgrims, both Indians and non-Indians, not infrequently returned to Indian ports without any sort of identity paper, arrangements were made this year, in consultation with the Government of India, to provide with special emergency passes all those proceeding to India by sea and not already in possession of a proper pilgrim pass or national passport. This also fits in with the requirements of the Hejazi authorities, who have tightened up their regulations, and insist that all departing pilgrims should produce papers. The new arrangement applies more particularly to destitutes, who, as will be seen below, often came to the Hejaz overland and have never had or have lost their papers. Hi At: c Representations by Pilgrims, &amp;c. 172. The Government of India returned on the 26th May a considered reply to the memorial by Messrs. Abdul Latif and Kadri, which has already been mentioned in connexion with the question of improved arrangements for first and second-class pilgrims. The reply was generally sympathetic, but was adverse or non -committal on most points. As regards inoculation against cholera, the reply referred to the proposal to make this compulsory by one of the amendments to the Indian Merchant Shipping Act proposed in the Bill, which was laid before the Legislature early this year. The memorialists were informed of an arrangement made by the Government of India this year, in consultation with the Legation, that an Amir-ul-Haj, or else a committee of leading pilgrims, should be appointed by the Haj Committees in India or the Legation in Jedda, as the case may be, on ships carrying pilgrims to and from the Hejaz. 173. The pilgrims brought from Calcutta in the steamship ' Rizwani this year drew up a joint memorial addressed through the Legation to the Govern ment of Bengal. The Legation considered most of their complaints frivolous, but forwarded the memorial to the proper authorities in India. They related to various matters connected with accommodation; the alleged lack of attention to the special requirements of pilgrims; inadequate water supply; defects ot sanitation; insecurity from luggage, &amp;c., stacked on hatches; exposure to sun, rain and coal dust; lack of adequate medical supplies, compounder or nurse; lack of arrangements for the custody of valuables; and promiscuity in the arrangements for the sexes, entailing much hardship on women. . . 174. It is not unfair to say that many of the complaints made by pilgi' 1 ® 8 regarding the arrangements on board ship are exaggerated or trivial, as might be expected when people have voyaged wearily in conditions which must at best be uncomfortable. There is nevertheless still room for improvement in ce ^ al p directions, especially in matters affecting health. The Indian medical oiiice lij Pro! t (() Con Pixi t imm pal in libit Itpobit o -j 7 deposit; %ton ^11 clan : %rate( ^isai Vcent, J%iili . H i: f;*cldraws attention to the effects of overcrowding, due not so much to the number of pilgrims as to the congestion of luggage. He cites cases this year in which, what with the general conditions and the heat, pilgrims of nervous temperament lost their reason. One such person had to be sent back to India soon after landing One woman threw herself overboard and died. Another woman, who was suffering in this way, was taken in charge by the compounder of the Indian dispensary and made the Haj safely. Dr. Abdul Hamid endorses the view that latrines for deck passengers are apt not to be sufficiently cleaned and disinfected. He considers that the provision of ships' doctors in satisfactory, but that the stocks of medicines are inadequate and the indoor hospital arrangements poor. 175. It is hoped that the proposed amendments to the Indian Merchant Shipping Act will improve conditions in several important respects on lines advocated by the Haj Enquiry Committee in some of their recommendations. The principal proposals directly interesting the Legation at Jedda in the Bill as drafted early in 1932 related to the following matters :— (a) A tightening up of the return ticket and deposit system, with the special object of diminishing the danger of eventual destitution among pilgrims wishing to return to India. (b) New arrangements regarding refunds on return tickets and deposits and their reversion to Government of India if unclaimed. (c) Reduction from twenty-five to fifteen days of the allowed period of grace during which pilgrims may be made to wait in Jedda for shipment back to India. Other matters of considerable, though less direct, interest to the Legation were the following :— (d) Prohibition of cooking by pilgrims on board ship and arrangements for the compulsory supply of cooked food by shipping companies. (e) Compulsory immunisation of pilgrims against small-pox and cholera. (/) Fixation of the minimum space to be provided for each pilgrim in the between-decks. The Bill dealt also with a number of other points in which the Legation has only a general interest, as they have to do with matters mainly concerning India and the prohibition of private practice by doctors on board pilgrim ships. 176. A memorandum on these proposals written in London by His Majesty's Minister was communicated to the Government of India. He welcomed the proposals in so far as they related to matters concerning the Legation in Jedda, subject to certain observations on those at (a), {h) and {c) above. The most important of these observations bore on the constant desire of the Legation to see the deposit system substituted generally for the return ticket system and certain doubts as to the suitability to conditions in the Hejaz of the proposals regarding refunds. Mr. Hope Gill, having consulted the Indian vice-consul, endorsed Sir Andrew Ryan's views, laying special stress on the desirability of generalising the deposit system, or at least equipping the Governor-General in Council to make it obligatory without further legislation later on. He also recalled attention to a recommendation of the Haj Enquiry Committee, Avhich had not been acted upon, that all clauses in the Merchant Shipping Act relative to pilgrim traffic should be incorporated in a chapter entirely distinct from those relative to native passenger ships. Registration. Return Tickets and Deposit System. 177. The registration system continues to work satisfactorily. Considering its voluntary nature, it is gratifying to note that, out of 9,50o Indian pilgiims arriving by sea in 1932, 9,064 registered at the Legation. The unregistered balance is accounted for by single-ticket holders, certain pilgrims m the last two incoming ships who were in a hurry to get on to Mecca, and indigent persons \\ 10 try to elude the mutawwif's agent in the hope of escaping fees. The fact tnat 95 per cent, of the pilgrims do register is largely due to the tact that tne ik lan vice -consul visits personally all incoming ships and impresses on the piJgi mis ie advantage of the system. 1 1 ^ ^ i . w -c 178. Forty-two unclaimed or unused return halves of ticket dating fi cm 1930, which, if they had not been deposited at the Legation, might have got into the hands of impostors or otherwise gone astray, were forwarded tins \eai to258 3S the Government of India. The precautions against any illicit traffic in return passages on the part of Indians were effective, except for two cases in which Indian pilgrims who had got their embarkation cards, as usual, only a few hours before sailing time, sold them to finance a journey to Medina. There were more numerous cases of the sale of return halves of tickets by non -Indian pilgrims from Indian ports, especially those from Chinese Turkestan. Steps were taken to check this abuse with the assistance of the mutawwif's agent concerned. 179. Five persons who had not deposited their return tickets lost them during the pilgrimage. The shipping agents were warned and arrangements were made for the issue of embarkation cards without production of the tickets A few cases occurred in which pilgrims lost their embarkation cards on the way to their ships. This is attributed to the smallness of the cards, and it is hoped that the adoption of a new kind of card by Messrs Turner, Morrison and Co next year will overcome the difficulty. One case was reported this year in which a pilgrim passing through the quarantine station was deluded into giving up his embarkation carcl to a rogue representing himself as an official. 180. The Indian vice-consul draws attention in his report to certain difficulties which arise in connexion with the special pilgrimage arrangements, made by the State of Hyderabad. These are being reported separatelv to the^ Government of India. Local Haj Committee. 181. Some apprehension was felt this year lest, as a result of the contro versy over the pilgrimage tariff, &amp;c., mutawwifs' agents might be debarred from free intercourse with the Legation staff, and it should be difficult to constitute the Haj Committee for the usual purpose of controlling the distribution of return bookings. These fears proved groundless. The committee was constituted as. usual and sat at the house of the Indian vice-consul. The late Governor of Jedda must be given credit for having promoted the reconstitution of the committee, which shoulders responsibility for dealing with a problem that would otherwise^ as he had learnt from experience, impose a great strain on himself in his capacity as shipping agent. Nevertheless, the committee must be regarded as a precarious institution, as the Government might at any time refuse to countenance its, operations. Destitutes. 182 It had been feared that, owing to the large number of poor pilgrims attiacted by the prospect of a Iriday Haj and miscalculation of the cost of the pilgi image in the extraordinary circumstances described in section (9), the Legation would have to deal with a very large number of destitutes at the end of the season. It was largely due to the wisdom of the authorities in India in aiastically reducing the number of pilgrims allowed to travel on single tickets mat this apprehension was falsified. The total number repatriated up to the time or writing (and it is believed that it will not be materially increased) has been 2o8 as compared with 318 in 1931 and 387 in 1930. The analyses of the total number by provinces of origin and routes of access to the Hejaz is as follows:— (a) Province of Origin— Sincl Bengal ... Punjab ... Baluchistan Malabar Lnited Provinces X .W .F. Province ... Assam Delhi Bombay ... Kashmir State Behar and Orissa Ceylon ... No. 76 57 47 29 20 9 8 4 3 9 1 1 139 (b) Route of Access— By overland on foot— Via Yemen Via Nejd Via Iraq, &amp;c. Ity sea— Single-ticket holder: Return - ticket hold refunds or lost 258 183, The Jedda agents of Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co. quoted a rate of 50 rupees pei nead for destitutes. The authorities in India were able to get a reduced quotation of 40 rupees per head, the same rate as was charged last year. In the view of the Legation it is unduly high, in view of the fact that the company have a monopoly of the trade of carrying pilgrims from India and are not compelled to run any special service for destitutes, who help to fill up ships otherwise not likely to carry a full complement of pilgrims. A sum of 220 rupees was collected from certain persons who seemed able to contribute to their passage money. The actual amount expended on behalf of the Government of India was 10,485 rupees 7 a. 184. The large proportion of overland pilgrims in the above total demonstrates anew the importance of devising measures to check the movement of pilgrims without adequate means and not travelling direct by sea, a question which is still engaging the attention of the Government of India. It is also desirable that pilgrims travelling by direct sea in the off season should be required to take return tickets. Twenty-five pilgrims who arrived in the steamship ' Alavi ' lifter the end of the 1931 pilgrimage declared themselves destitute on arrival in Jedda, and all but two or three, who came from Karachi between the 1931 and 1932 seasons, were single-ticket holders. The total, fortunately small this year, of persons who had at one time had return tickets but no longer had them, consisted largely of two classes, viz. : (a) persons who remain in the Hejaz for study and fall destitute, after having obtained a refund of the value of the return ticket money at the end of the first two years; and (b) Indians, who, often without their own knowledge, are palmed off by mutawwifs and sabees on the authorities as being Hejazis with addresses in Mecca. It was hoped that the number at (a) might be reduced by the adoption of the proposal that the period during which refunds would be allowed should be extended to four years, and that they should not be granted until the expiration of the full term, unless the Indian vice-consul was satisfied that the applicant was unlikely to become destitute. It is doubtful whether the proposed amendments to the Indian Merchant Shipping Act will be equally efficacious. As regards persons under (b), it is suggested that measures should be taken in India not to stamp pilgrim passes ' Toreign without careful verification when the applicant purports to be a Hejazi. It is not always possible to refuse repatriation at Government expense to persons of this class simply on the ground that they have declared themselves to be foreign subjects, as they are frequently the innocent victims of imposture. Normally, any genuine Hejazi embarking in India should be in possession of a Hejazi passport. *85. Ther^ are always apt to be some stowaways who get to the Hejaz without a ticket or pass, and may, in due course, if allowed to land, applj for repatriation as destitutes. It was startling to find this year, however, that the seemingly respectable and educated editor of a Hyderabad paper had resorted to this means of coming to the Hejaz. He unfortunately got ashore owing to the charity of his fellow passengers, who subscribed towards his passage. 186. Similar precautious steps to those described in paragraph 143 of last, year's report were taken to furnish the authorities in India with nominal lists of repatriated destitutes and to take from the latter undertakings to repay the money expended on their return. The practice now followed of requiring such undertakings in all cases has increased the difficulty of getting the applicants to furnish true home addresses. In some cases persons who originally arrived by sea, and are in possession of pilgrim passes, pretend to have come overland. The 115 75 17 — 207 s or stowaways ... 34 ers who obtained embarkation cards 17 5140 pilgrimage staff of the Legation cross-questions the applicants as closely as possible in suspicions cases, and the authorities in India were again asked this year to use care in checking off the returning destitutes. Deceased Pilgrims' Estates. 187. The Indian vice-consul is still dissatisfied with the Hejazi arrange ments for dealing with the estates of deceased Indian pilgrims and the unwillingness of the Government to afford redress in cases of misappropriation. He notes'the fact that the case of the woman pilgrim mentioned in paragraph 110 of last year's report is still outstanding in spite of several reminders. Correspondence has passed during the last year between the Legation and the Hejazi Government, and between the Legation and authorities in India, regarding improved arrangements for dealing with the effects, especially the bulky effects, of deceased pilgrims. Forged Indiaxn Currency Notes. 188. There was no trouble locally this year (see paragraph '21 on ttie general question). Publicity. 189. The pilgrimage guide issued by the Government of India is of great utility. Its usefulness would be much increased if it included more information about the Hejaz end, but it is suggested that any revision with this object should be delayed until it is possible to judge the effect of the various schemes which have been engaging the attention of the Hejazi Government. This matter will form the subject of a separate report to the Government of India in due course. 190. In any case no attempt should be made to include the pilgrimage tariff in the guide, as it is still liable to variation from year to year. It is suggested that the tariff and the Legation's estimate of the cost of the pilgrimage, when available, should be printed separately in the principal Indian languages for distribution to intending pilgrims, and that a supply of each issue should be sent to the Legation to enable it to meet requests for information in Jedda. 191. It is desirable that precise information regarding the medical facilities provided for pilgrims by the Government of India should be included in the pilgrim guide issued in India, and that any other possible steps should be taken to bring them to the knowledge of intending pilgrims, e.g., the publication of press communiques in English and vernacular languages. It has also been suggested that the position of the Indian doctor would be stronger and better known to pilgrims of education and influence if his appointment were gazetted.. His Majesty's Minister endorses this suggestion, subject to its compatability with Government practices in India and to the importance of defining the position of the doctor as that of an officer attached to His Majesty's Legation as head of the Indian Medical Section rather than as a member of a supposed ' Indian vice-consulate.' The use of the latter term by certain Indian departments tends to obscure the fact that the Government of India establishment in Jedda, although organised in two sections of the Legation, forms an integral part of it 192. It is still desirable that effect should be given to the proposals of His Majesty's Minister regarding signboards for the offices, &amp;c., served by the Indian section of the Legation and the medical staff. The Government of India were unable, for financial reasons, to supply these for use during the 1982 season. Banking Facilities. 193. As a result of the unfortunate experiences described in paragraph 152 of last year s report, the use of hundis greatly diminished in 1932. There has, however, been no increase in modern banking facilities, Jedda being the only centre at which they exist on any important scale. There has of late been much talk of schemes for an Arabian National Bank. These are bound up with schemes for economic development, but they are nebulous. The Lutfullah family in Egy})t. who were concerned with a similar project in King Hussein's time, has again displayed activity in connexion with one proposal. ' Another is associated with the name of the ex Khedive. Nothing came of a suggestion made by Ibn Saud ifl June 1931 that His Majesty s Government might induce an English concern t(&gt; undertake the functions of a State bank, or of a project, in which Ismail Ghuznavi41 w as mtercBted, and for which he is said to have got sanction from Ibn Sand to establish a Hejazi branch of the Moslem Bank of India. Indian Section of the Legation. 194 q h 1 ^f S 1 A 10t , been P osslble ^ proceed with the general reorganisation proposed bv Sir Andrew Ryan last year (see paragraph 155 of the previous report), although something has been done to improve the position of the Indian vice-consul. Munshi, no \ Khan Bahadur, Thsanullah has continued to occupy this post with his usual zeal, and Mr. Shah Jehan Kabir to carry out the duties of senior clerk with industry and ability. The second clerk, Syed Nur Hussem Shah, was returned to India on grounds of health on the 17th March 1932, and his work was carried on b\ Ha ii Mohammad Sherif, who had been appointed to the temporary post of third clerk in 1931. The post of second clerk was not filled until the 16ta August, 1932, when Syed Ghulam Reza arrived from India and Haji Mohammad Sherif returned to that countrv. The oost of third clerk has been suppressed. The usual temporary additional staff was employed durino- the busy season. The principal person so employed was Qazi Fazlullah, who has had twelve years' experience in the shipping agency business, and proved useful for work connected with registration and return tickets. Pilgrimage Tariff and Cost of Pilgrimage. 195. This subject is dealt with fnllv iu section (9), with special referenoo to its effect on Indian pilgrims. (11) Afghan Pilgrimage. 196. As stated elsewhere, the number of Afghan pilgrims in 1932 was 1,751 as compared with 973 in 1931. Almost all travelled with return tickets or deposit paid passes. There was therefore no repetition after the pilgrimage of destitution on the scale described in paragraph 158 of last year's report. Such cases of destitution as arose were mostly those of persons who had come overland or remained over from last year. In the absence of assistance, the majority left for their homes overland. 197. In November 1931 the old arrangement was renewed whereby the Turkish Legation takes charge of Afghan interests (see paragraph 160 of last year's report), but the charge is understood to weigh lightly. 198. The most notable feature of the Afghan pilgrimage in 1932 was the visit of an Afghan mission under Sirdar Ahmed Shah, who is closely related to King Nadir Shah. The party made the Haj and concluded a Treaty of Friendship which was negotiated in Mecca, but was not signed until the King could come to Jedda to receive the mission officially, Mecca being now considered unsuited by its sacred character for diplomatic ceremonies. The audience took place on the 3rd May; the signature of the treaty on the 5th May. 199. The mission purchased a house in Mecca for £6,000 gold (£5.000 down and the balance to be paid within six months) to serve as a hostel for Afghan pilgrims. There was some dissension among the Afghans as to whether they should buy this house, which belonged to the Governor of Jedda, or acquire a site and build. The Afghan Minister in Cairo apparently swayed the decision in favour of the deal with the Governor, a friend of his, it is said. 200. Mention is made in paragraph 87 of the newly-established Afghan medical mission The Indian vice-consul, despite what is said in that paragraph, testified to the 'care and tenderness ' shown by the Punjabi doctor and his Afghan compounder. He adds, however, that the general impression was that there was much propaganda about the whole thing and that the invocation of blessings on the King of Afghanistan, Nadir Shah, was so much a part of every treatment that it became the custom of Indian pilgrims to greet the doctor on all occasions with the cry ' Takht Bakht Ghazi Bar Qarar.' This phrase, meaning .'May the Throne and the Fortune of the Ghazi abide for ever.' was one recited in chorus with the Afghan pilgrims by the members of the Afghan medical mission. [7721] g42 (12) Malay Pilgrimage. 201. The following paragraphs are adapted from the special report by the Malay pilgrimage officer, Haji Abdul Majid, the original of which has been submitted to the Government of the Straits Settlements. Shipping (outward from Malay Forts). 202. The first pilgrim ship was the steamship ' Polyphenus'' which left Singapore on the 5th November, 1931, carrying only four Malays in a total of only twelve pilgrims. Only four ships in all carried pilgrims from Malayan ports to Jedda, the last arriving on the 28th February, 1932. All were of the Blue Funnel Line, two under the British flag and two under the Dutch. The Blue Funnel Line provided two ships for the return voyage to Malaya, one of which left Jedda on the 1st May, the other on the 14th May. As the pilgrims were no more than could be carried in one ship, this liberal provision of shipping was much appreciated. Numher of Pilgrims. 203. The total number of pilgrims embarked at Malayan ports was 425, of whom only eighty were Malayan, the remainder being of Dutch, Siamese, Chinese, United States of America, and Hejazi nationality. The composition of the total of eighty Malayan pilgrims is shown by places of origin as follows :— Straits Settlements— Singapore 17 Penang and Province Wellesley 6 Malacca 6 Labuan ... 0 Federated Malay States— Perak 13 Selangor 17 Negri Sembilan ... 1 Pahang .5 Unfederated Malay States— Johore ... 8 Kedah ... 4 Perlis 0 Kenlanton 3 Trengganu 0 Brunei 0 80 J he tremendous decline in the number of Malaya pilgrims in spite of the prospect of a i riday Haj (see paragraph 5) can only be attributed to extremely depressed economic and financial condition in Malaya. Feeding on Board Ship. 204. Haji Abdul Majid states that as a result of press criticism last year, there was some attempt during the 1931—32 season to improve the manner of pieparing the food in pilgrim ships, but he considers that there is still room for improvement. He recalls attention to the following passages in a memorandum yvhich he wrote in April 1930 on this subject, and observes that unless the food is cooked m accomance with the recommendations contained therein, the curry ingredients, &amp;c., supplied to the ships can only go to waste ,(1) ^ should be noted that a Malay or a Javanese eats his rice with gulai and/or sayor, either of which gives him the gravy or ' kuah to help him to swallow the dry rice. Rice without ' kuah ' to a Malay, as now supplied to the pilgrims, is worse than coolies' food. I \ urry or gulai,' as it is called in Malay, is prepared by cooking ei lev {a) meat, or (b) fish (salted or otherwise) with curry-pow 7 der (rempah- rempah), chillies and coconut-milk (santan).43 I .]i h ® M ^ la y or Javanese way of preparing ' savor ' is to boil it in ooconut-milk santan). Any Malay cook knows how to prepare ' savor C the ships cooks apparently are not inclined to get the santan ' out of the coconuts. 0 Ltu ux LUC a 2 f 05 Q ^i 11106 t , he 1 date of . the Pijgrimage officer's report, the Government of the Straits Settlements have informed His Majesty's Minister, in a letter dated the j 1 j ^ f' 0 / .i 11 ' V 1 ^ 101110 ask the Singapore agents of the Blue Funnel to find a remedy for the defects criticised by Haji Abdul Majid. Sheikhs' or Mutawwifs' Charges. 206. The general treatment of the subject of pilgrimage costs in section (9&gt; makes it unnecessary to reproduce all that Haji Abdul Mai id has to say on this subject. He works out the Malay pilgrims' expenditure on the charg-es enumerated m paragraph 170 of last year's report at a little more in Heiazi currency than the amount for 1931. Reducing the amounts to Straits currency he obtains the following approximate estimates : — Total charges in 1931, £28, plus 31-^ riyals = roughly 270 dollars. Total charges in 1932, £28^, plus 60 riyals = roughly 387 dollars. These figures show that the Legation was not far out in January 1932 (see- paragraph 136) in reckoning that the cost of the pilgrimage this year in currencies moving Avith sterling would be about 40 per cent, greater than in 1931. Haji Abdul Majid mentions consequences similar to those reported by the Indian vice-consul, viz., that pilgrims who did not make a liberal margin in their estimate of expenses before leaving Malaya, found themselves compelled to ghe up the visit to Medina or go by a cheaper means of conveyance, namely, by camels, instead of by cars.' General Conditions during the Pilgrimage Season. 20/. Apart from the comments summarised above on regulation charges,. Haji Abdul Majid refers to the increased cost of food-stuffs, although water, he says, was comparatively cheap in Mecca throughout the season. He speaks of the peace and security, which have prevailed in the Hejaz since the beginning of the present regime as having been maintained, adding that ' casual thefts like everywhere else of course occurred ' (c/. paragraph 15 above). He considers that the Hejazi authorities took all possible measures ' as before .... to safe guard the health of the pilgrims during the Haj days, the 15th to the 19th April.' 208. Haji Abdul Majid again draws attention to the hardships still imposed on pilgrims by the regulation mentioned in paragraph 175 of last year's report, that pilgrims remaining in the Hejaz for more than one season must find a guarantor for possible liabilities to local traders before being allowed to leave the country. A recent Hejazi regulation on passports published on the 1st July, 1932, reinforces rather than abates the restrictions. 209. Haji Abdul Majid intervened successfully in such matters as the recovery of over-payments to sheikhs, although in a small number of cases there was considerable delay, owing, he says, to the apparent inability of the Hejazi authorities to expedite matters of this kind, especially during the actual season. Assistance to Pilgrims. 210. It was necessary this year to ask the Government of the Straits Settle ment to increase the grant for the purpose of repatriating destitutes to £200, of which £199 10,?. was actually expended. Many of the cases were those of persons who had come in earlier seasons to the Hejaz with single tickets, intending to remain permanently, but who could neither get food from Malaya owing to the slump there, nor fall back, as in the past, on the generosity of their sheikhs, now themselves in straitened circumstances. 211. Although, as stated in paragraph 202, the Blue Funnel Line made a liberal provision of shipping for returning pilgrims, they felt unable to comply with a request that reduced fares should be quoted for poor persons. [7721] «44 Suggestions for the Preventlon of Destitution. 212. Haji Abdul Majid reverts to the suggestion made in 1930 by Dato Perdana Mentri of Kelantan (see paragraph 17s of the last report) that necessary payments to sheikhs should be covered in advance by a deposit in Malaya and paid through the Malay pilgrimage officer. In his report on this year s pilgrimage, Haji Abdul Majid suggests an alternative scheme, namely, that intending pilgrims should be required to satisfy the authorities in Malaya of their ability to meet all expenses by providing themselves with bank drafts payable in Jedda, to an amount, per pilgrim, of not less than 450 dollars or £40. The Government of the Straits Settlements, having considered this on receipt of a copy of his report from the pilgrimage officer, have already notified His Majesty's Minister that, in their opinion, there is as yet no need to compel pilgrims to'be in possession of a minimum sum. They explain that intending pilgrims are notified of the probable cost of the pilgrimage when they apply for passes, and that a form quoting the tariff of dues payable is widely circulated, and is brought to the notice of all pilgrims. Conditions governing the Issue of Steamship Tickets and Refunds. 213. As a result of a further exchange of views between the official authorities and shipping interests concerned, a new set of ' Guiding Rules,' to replace those described in paragraph 180 of last year's report, were agreed to early this year between the Government of the Straits Settlements and the Blue Funnel Line. The following is a summary of the principal provisions of these new rules, the text of which was communicated to the Legation under cover of a despatch from the Governor of Singapore of the 5th April :— {a) The conditions in which single tickets may be issued in Malaya are laid down closely and in a suitable restrictive sense. {h) Return ticket holders wishing to remain in the Hejaz up to five years, may, on the recommendation of the proper British authority in Jedda, obtain an extension of the normal two years' validity of their tickets up to a total validity of five years, provided that they apply within six months of the expiration of the original validity. (c) Holders of unused return tickets may, in recommended cases, and provided that they are still in the Hejaz, obtain a refund of 33J per cent., less charges, of the whole value of the ticket on the expiration of the normal validity of the ticket, subject to application being made within six months of such expiration. refund of 30 per cent, may be claimed, when the validity has been extended, at any time during the period of extended validity or within six months of its expiration. (d) A refund of 50 per cent, of the full value, less certain charges, may be made to the next of kin of the deceased holder of a valid ticket, whether during the period of original validity or of properly authorised extension of validity, if claimed within six months of death. A refund of 30 per cent, may be made in respect of such a ticket, if the claim be made more than six months after the death, but not more than two years after death, provided that death has occurred within five years of the date of issue, and that the application is made within five and a half years of the date of issue. A similar refund may be made even though the validity has not been extended, provided the claim is made not more than five years after the date of issue. 214. The new rules regarding refunds apply to tickets issued in and after 1930. They go far to meet the desiderata expressed by the Legation in the course of the correspondence, and the liberal spirit shown by the Blue Funnel Line in accepting them is much appreciated. Mortality. 215. Only two of the eighty pilgrims who arrived during the season were reported to have died. Deceased Pilgrims' Effects. 216. The usual arrangements were in operation whereby the effects of pilgrims who had died during the previous season without accompanying relativesMi U : ;' 45 were received at the Legation and handed over to the Malay pilgrimage officer for distribution in the course of this season to the next-of-kin; while the effects of deceased pilgrims accompanied by relatives were handed over to the latter bv the Beyt-al-Mal. Malay Pilgrimage Staff. ' 217. Owing to the smallness of the pilgrimage, the pilgrimage officer. Haji Abdul Majid, did not arrive -in Jedda until the 28th February, some two months latei than usual, and he was able to leave m the second, and last, returninp* pilgrim ship on the 14th May. He was again assisted by Haji Mohammad Jamil who served as clerk for the third season running and took up his duties on the 27th December, 1931. (13) West A fi 'lean Pilgrimage. 218. According to the figures obtained from the local quarantine authori ties, 780 British West African pilgrims made the Haj in 1932. as compared with 1,558 last year. These figures comprise only pilgrims arriving at Jedda. Ao certain estimate can be made of the number of those arriving by dhow from Massawa at the smaller ports south of Jedda, where they escape quarantine dues, but it has been put conjecturely at something over 400. 219. Final agreement was reached in the autumn of 1931 among the various British authorities concerned regarding the proposals for a better regulation of the pilgrimage from Nigeria (see paragraph 188 of last year's report). The scheme, in its final form, provides for the issue of a standard form of Nigerian pilgrim pass at Maidaguri and the payment of a deposit there to finance the pilgrims' expenses, including return ticket to Jedda, at Suakin with a margin of £1 for ultimate assistance at Jedda. The other rules laid down need not be reproduced in detail. They provide, inter alia, for the transmission to the Legation of copies of all future pilgrim passes issued to pilgrims included in the scheme, whether at Maidaguri or at Suakin, together with the return halves of their steamer tickets. This will enable the Legation to identify the pilgrims and to put them on their homeward way. 220. It is generally recognised that no measures to regulate this pilgrimage even on the simple lines contemplated can be entirely effective unless the Italian authorities can be induced to fulfil more effectively than they have hitherto done the undertaking given in 1928 to put a stop to the transport of pilgrims by dhow from Massawa. Much light has been thrown since the last report was written on the diversion of this traffic, owing principally to the fact that the depressed economic conditions in the Hejaz threw on the hands of the Legation many hundreds of ' Takruni ' candidates for repatriation to Africa. The Sudan, also depressed, at first declined to accept any but those who had arrived from that country, of whom there proved to be 108, but in March further batches totalling 223 were sent to Sudan with the consent of the Sudani Government. In the interval 581 had been shipped to Massawa. This mass repatriation of Takrunis necessitated close investigation of individual cases, which was held in collabora tion with the Italian Consulate at Jedda. It gave the following results as regards the ports by which the persons examined had reached the Hejaz at various times since i928 : — Port of arrival in Qahma (Asir) Birk (Asir) Qunfida Lith az- Number. 739 30 27 3 799 f ♦ i 17^ j vj/ • i- ■ TJU : 221. The Italian authorities in Jedda and Eritrea were most helpful in facilitating the repatriation of the persons sent via Massawa at a very cheap rate. The fact remains that, if so many came forward as destitutes at one time of stress, the dhow traffic must have been on a great scale during the years [7721] h 246 indicated. It is clear from a Khartum despatch sent to Cairo on the 25th August, 1931, that the traffic is highly organised. In more recent corre spondence the Italian Government have given themselves away by maintaining that they enforce the promised restrictions in accordance with the International Sanitary Convention, but only, it would appear, in the case of avowed pilgrims They contend that they cannot be held responsible, if persons purporting to have other objects in Arabia change their minds and go on pilgrimage. ^His Majesty's Minister has pointed out the absurdity of supposing that West Africans can proceed to such places as those named in the preceding paragraph with any object other than that of visiting Mecca, however much they may tarrv on the way, as is their habit. He considers that all British West Africans seeking embarkation at Massawa for any port in the Hejaz or Asir must he presumed to be intending pilgrims. 222. The repatriations referred to above affected a great clearance, which was completed before the 1932 pilgrimage, of destitute Takrunis. Four appli cations were made after the 1932 season. It is probable that further cases will arise as the year wears on. but it is not anticipated that they will be numerous unless there is a serious further deterioration in conditions in the Hejaz. (14) Somali Pilgrimage. 223. According to the Hejazi quarantine statistics, 115 ' Somalis ' arrived in Jedda by sea this year as compared with 508 last year, of whom 103 were shown as coming from British Somali land. On this occasion the distribution by nationality has not been given. It is therefore impossible to give a separate figure for pilgrims arriving from British Somaliland in 1932. Captain Seager doubts whether the number can have exceeded forty. 224. In any case, those arriving direct from Somaliland form only one element in the total number of British Somalis who reach the Hejaz bv devious routes of the kind described in paragraphs 190-193 of last year's report, who in yci ) many cases have no sort of identity papers, and who, even before starting on these long Arabian treks may have left the Protectorate at a considerably earlier . Correspondence is in progress between the Legation and the Government ox Bi itish Somaliland on the whole subject. Up to the time of writing the conclusions which appear to emerge from it are— [a) 1 hat pilgrims who leave Somaliland direct for the Hejaz are normally comparatively well-to-do people; (&amp;) That it is difficult to impose any sort of control on Somalis leaving Africa, as they easily can, by ports other than those in the Protectorate, or those who, having fetched up somehow or other on the Arabian coast, make their way to the Hejaz in any other way than by sea passage from Aden. As legai ds (a), it is hoped that the Protectorate Government may adopt the uni oim type of pass mentioned in paragraph 28. They are arranging to take a 0 f. rupees from each Somali pilgrim taking out a pass and to forward mon hy lists of such pilgrims to the Legation. This marks an advance, which WO k i • e more valuable if all pilgrims, regardless of nationality, em ai ung at 1 i otectorate ports could be required to take out passes in the same way as,^ e.g., m India and the Sudan. 22o. The main difficulty which confronts the Legation in present conditions, However, is that of dealing with persons under head (b) when they come to its notice as destitutes seeking repatriation. In the absence of the above identity papers caretul enquiry is necessary to determine whether they have any claim to be regarded as British If such a claim be established and they are really s 1 u e, ey can only be repatriated to the Protectorate, wherever they may a \ c come _Jom, except m some cases where they are domiciled at Aden.

This year no less than four attempts had to be made to make use of prospective opportunities before the party was actually embarked. iTf The three defeated attempts, spread over nineteen days, added materially to ! the total expenditure. e b|| I ion i lejazki srepori,! eforeit (15) Sudan Pilgrimage. The Hejazi quarantine figures show 527 Sudanese pilgrims this year ■as compared with 588 in 1931. All these arrived by Khedivial steamers from Suakin. Doubt is thrown on the value of the figures quoted by the very startling discrepancies between the statistics obtained in Jedda and those given in a recent report by the Sudan Medical Service for the years 1928 to 1931. To take only cue example, that report shows 961 Sudanese pilgrims as having embarked at Suakin in 1931, whereas the Hejazi figure is 588. 229. The demands this year on the small fleet of the Khedivial Mail Line, which also carried pilgrims not only from Suez, but from Syria, produced a shortage of shipping facilities for the return to Suakin, with the result that many pilgrims, unable to secure accommodation in outgoing ships, had to wait from six to eighteen days for the next following opportunity. Numerous appeals were made to the Legation to arrange for an increased supply of ships or to assist pilgrims whose funds had run out. The Legation could do nothing to increase shipping, but in cases of real need some pecuniary assistance was given out of the Sudan Repatriation Fund. 230. One of the delayed pilgrims was Sheikh Ismail-al-Azhari, C .B .E., the 'Grand Mufti of the Sudan, a fine old gentleman of over 80. He fell ill with fever during his detention, and at one moment there were fears for his life, but he happily recovered. 231. Apart from thirty-two pilgrims who held return tickets, but had to be temporarily assisted in Jedda, as described in paragraph 229, a large number of Sudanese, who had been temporarily resident in the Hejaz, decided to return to their homes owing to the prevailing depression. A fair number of these were destitute and had to be repatriated at the expense of the Sudan Repatriation Fund. 232. Following a correspondence with His Majesty's Legation at Jedda, which had urged (though more with a view to the control of West Africans than of Sudanese) that, if possible, return tickets should be made compulsory at Suakin all the year round and that the terms of validity should be extended, the Sudan Government made an important communication to the Legation on the 14th January, 1932. It was to the effect that arrangements had been made with the Khedivial Company to issue only return tickets to pilgrims all the year round, subject to an understanding that the medical authorities in the Sudan should not subject to quarantine ships carrying back odd pilgrims after the end of the pilgrimage, and that single tickets might be issued to bona fide non-pilgrims. The company would not officially extend the validity of return tickets for moie than a year, but were prepared to regard them unofficially as valid up to tvvo years. These arrangements are of great value, as the previous system, wheieby return tickets were only compulsory during the period preceding the pilgi image ^ season, enabled many pilgrims of the leisurely moving Takruni class to cross the Red Sea with single tickets between seasons, thereby increasing the dangei of tiff lis their becoming candidates for repatriation sooner or later. ^ ._ 233. The Sudan Government have adopted an improved form of pilgrim j pass in consultation with the Legation at Jedda. W0\ aiG 11 (16) Zanzibari and, East African Pilgrimage. I pa ^ 234. According to the Hejazi quarantine authorities, y Zanzibar and East Africa reached Jedda this year as compared with thn ty-three 0 m 1931. Most of the pilgrims from Zanzibar and Kenya travelled with regular j|j|$ P a P er s, either British passports or permits.( iJ* |S( tt( \ 43 235. A pilgrim from Zanzibar, but of Hadhramaut origin, named Ahmed J# liajab was killed by a lorry belonging to one of the Government-controlled companies, while walking along the road from Mecca to Jed da a few days after .ij Pilgrimage Day. There is reason to believe that the car, which was driven by an Indian chauffeur, was seriously defective. 1 he Indian was airested, and the Hejazi authorities enquired in due course whether the pilgrim s heirs, if anv, wished to take part in proceedings against him. It has been ascertained that the deceased had no property or heirs in Zanzibar, but was believed to have left a widow and minor children in the Hadhramaut. The correspondence is still Drocccdinsr. 236. A woman named Mai Rahma, who was in possession of a regular Nairobi passport, sought the assistance of the Legation just before the departure of the last ship for Mombasa on the ground that she had exhausted her funds. As there was no time to refer to the Government of Kenya, the Legation assumed the responsibility of advancing £5 gold to make up the sum required, the shipping i f agents having on their side undertaken to contribute a similar amount, if the '' Legation would do the rest. u ® ft rippli (17) South African Piigriinage. 237. The Hejazi quarantine returns show sixty-two pilgrims as having arrived in Jedda from South Africa in 1932 as compared with fifty-one in 1931. The majority had South African passports. These pilgrims are normally people of substance and present no difficulty to the Legation. (18) Palestine and T vans] or dan Pilgrimage. 238. According to the Hejazi quarantine returns, no less than 1,352: pilgrims came this year from Palestine and Transjordan as compared with only 447 in 1931. The figure given for this year agrees pretty closely with the total number notified by the authorities in Jerusalem as having taken out permits, the High Commissioner having informed the Legation by letter of the 30th April, 1932, that 1,290 permits had been issued up to date to Palestinians and twenty-four to Transjordanians. The great majority travelled via Kantara and arrived in Jedda and Yambo by Khedivial steamer from Suez. 239. These pilgrims were evidently much affected by the increased cost of the pilgrimage in currencies based on sterling. The feature of the return season was a remarkable rush on the deposits of £4 required to be made in Palestine before the pilgrim starts. Within three weeks of Pilgrimage Day it was. necessary for the Legation to advance the very abnormal sum of £2,141 to 536 applicants. 239 a . Palestinian pilgrims suffered the same inconvenience as those from the Sudan (see paragraph 229) owing to shortage of shipping, and manifested their displeasure by sending delegations to the Legation, where Captain Seager placated them daily as best he could. 240. The increase in the number of pilgrims and the circumstances described in the preceding two paragraphs imposed a considerable strain on the .Legation, where Captain Seager has to deal with all pilgrims other than Indians and Malays in addition to performing his duties as pro-consul and helping the Chancery. His Majesty's Minister has consulted the High Commissioner for Palestine as to the possibility of supplying a clerk from Palestine, temporarily and as an experimental measure, next season. (19) Adenese Pilgrimage, 241. According to the information from the quarantine authorities^ ninety-seven Adenese pilgrims reached Jedda by sea in 1932. There is i 1( J corresponding figure for last year. The figure is understood to comprise a pilgrims from the Protectorate, other than Hadhramis, embarking at Aden to 1 Jedda. Only a few of these sought assistance on grounds of destitution after tne pilgrimage, but many persons from Aden and the Protectorate, including Somali iiie sei S® tfDI iaM( fMed nie toe: iirsi ■t). lea ittisve ■irein i for re 1 me c 'stibst H Cert; 'ciiD, &amp; viHM l ) brey m less tk pedi raJ 49 •settled at Aden, came overland, and, as usual, a number of these applied for help. Such persons commonly have no identity papers, and much labour is involved in the attempt to discriminate between persons entitled to British protection and -others, e.g., Yemenis from Aden and the Protectorate, who have no claim. There would appear to be no practical means, however, of ensuring that such overland pilgrims from Aden and the hinterland as are in fact persons entitled to British protection should take out papers. (20) Hadrartii Pilgrimage. 242. The Hejazi quarantine returns show 465 Hadrami pilgrims as having .arrived at Jedda by sea this year, as compared Avith 445 last year. Captain Seager is inclined to think the figure for 1931 somewhat exaggerated, but it cannot be disproved. These pilgrims embark mostly at Makalla in Jedda-bound ships, but some pass through Aden in transit. They return in the same manner, sometimes making use of British or Dutch ships returning to India or the Far East (cf. paragraph 156). 243. The semi-settled Hadrami occupies a peculiar position in the life of the Hejaz, where he is apt to remain for a period of years, say, two to six, and engages in many avocations, mostly of a commercial nature. It is a feature of the period following each pilgrimage that, apart from pilgrims coming and going during the season, many of these return to the Hadramaut. The prevailing depression tends to accentuate this movement. In many cases it is necessary to provide them with emergency travel documents. There were this year over 400 applications for such documents, and it is estimated that some 450 other persons, already in possession of documents issued at Makalla, may have also •wile back. O (21) Muscati Pilgrimage. 244. The Hejazi quarantine returns show thirty-six Muscati pilgrims as having arrived at Jedda by sea in 1932, as compared with fifty in i931. It is impossible to estimate the number of overland pilgrims from Muscat and 'Oman. In most years a small number of Muscatis appeal to the Legation for assistance, but in 1932 there were no requests for relief or repatriation. (22) Bahreini Pilgrimage. 245. According to the quarantine returns, 100 pilgrims arrived by sea from adeicfr Bahrein this year. There is no corresponding figure for last year. Other pilgrims igeft from Bahrein doubtless come overland. There were no applications to the m Legation for relief or repatriation. D(ll(f' i# to/ (23) Koweiti Pilgrimage. 246. Although this is in the main a direct overland pilgrimage, reports from the Political Agent at Koweit make it possible to give some account of it. The main camel caravan left Koweit on the 18th February, and consisted of some 1,500 persons, headed by a member of the sheikh's family, who, after the pilgrimage, gave great umbrage by leaving the pilgrims and returning very rapidly in a car provided by Ibn Saud. The caravan got back to Koweit on the 25th May. One event recorded in connexion with it is that Ibn Saud, in a letter addressed to the Sheikh of Koweit on the 26th February, accused Nejdis and others in the caravan of extensive smuggling. There does not appear to have been any substantial foundation for this charge. In any case, by the time it reached the sheikh, the pilgrims were well on their way to the Hsjaz, and the sheikh was able to sidetrack the complaint in a polite reply. 247. Certain richer pilsrrims from Koweit made the Haj by cai, notably one party which included six ladies, and which accomplished the whole journey theie and back without a hitch in three Ford cars. I he Sheikh of Koweit himself organised this experiment, which is interesting as a proof of the possibilities of motor transport for long -distance overland pilgrimages. Anothei striking example of its successful use, is that of a lad of 15, 'who is creditably reported to50 have motored a mixed party of pilgrims back from Mecca to last year in a Chevrolet lorry. Apparently he took a very circuitous route, but he got to Dabai all right in sixty-two days. (24) Sarawak Pilgrimage. 248. Sarawak, alone among British dependencies, maintains a pilgrimage organisation independent of the Legation, run by Messis. Gellatly, Hankev and Co. This pilgrimage, otherwise hardly distinguishable from that from Malaya, still, therefore, deserves its little separate niche. This year there were three pilgrims. They came and went in perfectly good order.M// &gt; this document is the PROPERTY OF His BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT ybllv . . r- - - - i BUSrJ'? XZm&amp;ZNCY. J I .

I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the usual annual report on the gil^ r i ma g e to the Holy Places of the Hejaz in 1933. It has been prepared on the same lines as the report for 1932, enclosed in Sir Andrew Ryan's despatch No. 379 of the 2nd September last. 2. Before leaving Jedda, Sir Andrew Ryan asked me to explain that he had prepared the draft of the present report, with my assistance, while he was still here, drawing very largely as usual on the copious information supplied by the members of his staff who are specially concerned with pilgrimage work. 3. Sir Andrew Ryan also asked me to record once more his appreciation of the valuable work done by the pilgrimage officers. Although the pilgrimage as a whole was much smaller than in 1932, the diminution in the number of Indians was by no means so great as might have been expected, and both the Indian vice- consul and the Indian medical officer had their hands full. The Malay pilgrimage officer had again very few pilgrims, but the diminution in routine work was compensated by the necessity for facilitating the operation of new ' Guiding Rules' and dealing with an unusual amount of,destitution. Captain Seager cannot be too highly praised for his tact and good humour in handling the still growing difficulties connected with pilgrims from miscellaneous British countries of origin. ^ 1 4. It is fair to draw special attention on this occasion to the tendency displayed by the Saudi Government to effect improvements in various directions and to use greater tolerance on the whole in their dealings with foreign Moslems. These are but small beginnings, but they afford proof of a genuine desire on the part of Ibn Saud and his advisers to provide greater facilities for pilgrims, a matter both of good business and of Islamic piety. 5. For the reasons given in paragraph 4 of Sir Andrew Ryan s despatch No. 379 of the 2nd September, copies of this despatch and enclosure are again being sent only to the Government of India (Foreign and Political Department), the Government of India (Department of Education, Health and Lands) and the Government of the Straits Settlements. It will doubtless be circulated in print to other authorities interested in the pilgrimage. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure in No. 1. Report on the Pilgrimage of 1933 (A.H. 1351). Index.

AS the 1932 pilgrimage season was nearing its close, the situation in Saudi Arabia was disturbed by a rebellion in the Northern Hejaz. It was invaded near Aqaba on the night of the 20th-21st May by a rebel band, whose principal leader was a Hejazi exile from Wejh named Hamid-bin-Rifada. The drastic steps taken by Ibn Saud to quell this movement included a very considerable mobilisation of Akhwan. The success of the action of the Government was largely promoted by energetic measures in Transjordan and elsewhere to prevent the passage of further rebels and to prevent Ibn Rifada from obtaining supplies from outside sources. His forces never assumed really large proportions and his defeat on the 30th July practically ended the movement. The affair, small in itself, was politically important. It was the prelude to the unification of Ibn Saud 's dominions in September under the name of Saudi Arabia and to intensified Anglo- Saudi negotiations, regarding the position between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan. 2. The political agitators behind Ibn Rifada's attempt had intended to organise a more or less simultaneous revolt in Asir. This plan miscarried, but a retarded revolt broke out in that area in October 1932. Hasan-al-Idrisi, the titular ruler of Asir, or what the Saudi Government prefer to call the Tihama of Asir in contradistinction to the inland province of Asir proper or Asir Surat, put himself at the head of the rebels. They had some initial successes, but were crushed at the end of the year by formidable Saudi forces. The Idrisi took refuge in the Yemen, the ruler of which country was politic and correct throughout the whole period, with the result that, although relations between Saudi Arabia and _ the Yemen were subjected to some strain, they were successfully preserved. 3. These events did not materially affect the 1933 pilgrimage except in one respect. The number of overland pilgrims from the Yemen, which in the preceding years had been great, was reduced to negligible proportions. In general the political setting of the pilgrimage was as good as could be desired. Ibn Saud's policy, both at home and abroad, during the year following the defeat of Ibn Rifada was one of conciliation. Having demonstrated his strength by his successes against the rebels in the Northern Hejaz and Asir he made it his object to disarm possible disloyalty elsewhere by kindness and tolerance rather than repression and to do what he might to ensure the permanence of his regime. The most spectacular single step taken with the latter object after the unification of the kingdom, was delayed until June 1933, when the King's eldest son was, with much ceremonial and swearing of fealty, declared Heir Apparent. In the foreign field also Ibn Saud showed himself inclined towards rapprochements. Srj. The Anglo-Saudi negotiations already mentioned and the influence brought to bear on the Amir Abdullah by His Majesty's Government led to mutual recognition between Transjordan and Saudi Arabia on the 1st April, 1933, to be followed by negotiations for a treaty settlement, which were begun in favourable conditions towards the end of April. 4. The promise of a Friday Haj made in anticipation of the 1932 pilgrimage could not be repeated. In spite of every effort made by the Saudi Government to stimulate the flow of pilgrims from overseas, the total number was only 20,705, as compared with the already low figure of 29,065 in 1932. This must again be attributed mainly to the persistence of economic depression in the principal countries of origin and most of all in the Dutch East Indies. 5. Pilgrimage day, the 9th Zil-Hijja, fell on Tuesday, the 4th April. It is estimated that on that day there may have been 50,000 Moslems of all origins, including Arabian townsmen, camelmen and other native elements, congregated at Arafat. This estimate agrees with that of the Saudi Government. 6. Climatic conditions were again favourable and the health of the pil grimage was unusually good. The Saudi medical personnel was rather more adequate in numbers than in 1932. These matters are dealt with in detail below. 7. Economic and financial conditions in the Hejaz were generally similar to those described in paragraph 10 of the 1932 report, although, on the one hand, enfoiced resignation made distress less obvious, and, on the other hand, the early | part of 1933 was marked by a wave of some optimism regarding the future, rjre 1 0 iitfsoj jjfSS' ^SID p iiiAni ilfs i Pnva i 11M | A [! 'itoliei] ®piiof Pei lbinspired by hopes of economic development and the rehabilitation of Government finance. The major projects in view, each of which would, it was hoped, bring immediate payments to the Treasury by concessionnaires, apart from ultimate benefits, were these : — (a) In March 1933 arrangements were agreed upon for the creation under the auspices of the ex-Khedive of Egypt and his associates of a State Bank. The contract was understood to provide for a loan of £200,000 gold, but a sinister silence has since brooded over the scheme. (b) In February a certain Dr. S. A. K. Jeelani, of Madras, obtained a concession for the building and exploitation of a railway from Mecca to Jedda, to be begun in October-November 1933 and completed within two years. The contract provided for an advance of a million rupees, to be repaid out of the Government share of the receipts. Dr. Jeelani's background in India is rather nebulous. (c) The prospect of a petroleum concession in Hasa gave rise to active competition, prolonged over the pilgrimage, between the Iraq Petroleum Company and the Standard Oil Company of California. The representative of the latter signed an agreement on the 29th May, subject to ratification by both sides. It has not been published, but it is understood that the company will pay a substantial sum down, perhaps £50,000 gold, for the right of exploring the still unknown petroleum possibilities of Hasa and eventually exploiting them, if they materialise, on agreed terms. 8. Other schemes less directly profitable to the Government but presenting idiili a general economic interest have taken or are taking shape. The principal are these:— (a) An agreement was concluded early in May between Sharqieh (Limited), Mr. Philby's firm, and the Government under which the company will for ten years supply, subject to certain exceptions, all the new requirements of the Government and authorised companies for motor transport, in the shape of Ford cars. Private cars of other makes may be imported, but must not be plied for hire. The company is given an absolute monopoly of the importation of tyres and accessories. They are to provide service stations. Payment for cars, &amp;c., supplied under the agreement are to be secured on 50 per cent, of the receipts of the Naqaba, i.e., the Government organisation controlling transport. (b) A group of Hyderabad Indians propounded some months before the pilgrimage a scheme to provide employment in the Hejaz by creating a textile industry. Initial action to finance and equip the scheme was taken early in the year in India. Some of the equipment reached the Hejaz, but the prospect of success is doubtful. The suggestion that the weavers should produce Ihrams, the traditional pilgrim garb, is thought to be impractical as the raw material would have to be imported into the Hejaz and the Ihrams then exported to the countries of origin of the pilgrims. The attraction in these countries of Ihrams made in the Holy Land seems unlikely to be sufficient to reconcile intending pilgrims to the greater cost involved, as compared with that of an ordinary home-made article. (c) The Government are in negotiation with Messrs. Ibrahim Jewan Baksh of Calcutta to provide Mecca with a public electrical supply. 9. Pending the realisation of the schemes mentioned in paragraph / above r the financial situation of the Saudi Government continues to be precarious. In June 1932 they gave a great extension to the system of issuing to their creditors drafts on customs, to be met by their acceptance in payment of future duty up to a stated percentage. In November they made known the combined result of an earlier decision to assign a definite proportion of revenue to the settlement of old debts, and the system of meeting them by drafts on customs, which were treated as creating a debt by the Treasury to the C ustoms Depart ment. The calculation showed that the amount of assigned revenue covered almost exactly the value of drafts issued up to date, leaving, however, a small credit balance. It was decided to postpone for a year the payment of old debts still outstanding, and to devote the credit balance in the '' debt chest to the [9002] B 2payment of 5 per cent, interest. It is claimed that these expedients had already reduced the floating debt to almost half of its previous dimensions, but the prospect of payment of the outstandings in November 1933 is very uncertain. Meanwhile, current finance, including the payment of salaries, is mueli hampered by lack of funds. One minor attempt to ease the situation has been the transfer from the Treasury to the Municipality of Mecca of the cost of entertaining the many guests from Nejd, who come annually to the Hejaz at pilgrimage time in the King's train. A more important development was the adoption on the 4th May of a new customs tariff (see paragraph 89 below). 10. The experiment of having a Dutch financial adviser produced no useful results. Even had his health not broken down twice, he would have been unable to impose reforms on the all-powerful Minister of Finance, whose methods are his own. The adviser left for good in May 1933, and died in Holland on the 7th July, to the great regret of the European community in Jedda. 11. For the present, the pilgrimage continues to be the main resource. The Saudi Government exerted great efforts to stimulate the flow of pilgrims in 1933 by intensive propaganda in the principal countries of origin. Wide distribution was given to a booklet, printed in various languages in Mecca, describing in attractive terms the arrangements for pilgrims. The Minister of Finance wrote privately to friends in India. The personal work there was carried on by Messrs. Ismail Ghaznavi and Muhammad Khan Ghazi Khan, notorious agitators, of whom more below, and by a certain Jemal Pasha, an ex-officer in the Turkish army, who has been a rolling stone and a hanger-on of Ibn Saud's for some years. The last-named is a man of loose character but plausible ways, which, with his title of pasha, appear to have impressed Indians greatly. He is said to have arranged for certain Indians to make the pilgrimage as Mushayekhs at the expense of the Saudi Government. Anyhow, he was most active, and seems to have spent 24,000 rupees of his master's money on hotel bills. Ismail Ghuznavi is also said to have spent over much and to have been warned to keep within his monthly allowance. Similar activity was displayed in Java by an Iraqi journalist named Yunus Bahri and a Koweiti colleague of his, both of whom keep in touch with Ibn Saud, and in Egypt by Seyyid Rashid Ridha. I se was also made of a prominent Hadhrami in Mecca, Seyyid Huseyn-al- Attas, who has much influence in Java and Malaya, and who addressed numerous letters, booklets and telegrams to his following. 12. Although the tendency of all this propaganda is to present the pilgrimage in a^ light more attractive than the conditions justify, there is no doubt that the Saudi Government have done a certain amount during the past year to provide facilities. The following may be mentioned here ;— {a) Fairly well equipped hotels for pilgrims of the richer class were started early this year in Mecca, Jedda and Medina. An Indian, Sir Rahim Baksh, was invited to preside at the opening of the Mecca hotel. The future of this experiment is doubtful. The hotel at Mecca was mainly patronised by kgyptmns. Only eleven guests are said to have stayed in that at Medina. The Jedcia hotel has served a double purpose, having been frequented by a small number of pilgrims, but also by concession hunters. The charges have so far 1 e en moderate, from 6^. to 10.&lt;?. gold a day for board and lodging. at ^ ? houses were provided this year at Shameysi and Bahra, on the Aiecca-Jedda road, and at Bir Ibn Hasani and Musajid, on the Jedda -Medina road, these supply tea, coffee, preserved food and dry rations, as well as beds a riyal a night. The Indian vice-consul doubts the utilitv of rest houses of this kind to the great mass of the pilgrims, who can get tea ^and coffee cheaper at ordinary cates. He would have preferred unfurnished rest houses to be provided tree ot charge, as he suggested last year to the King. {c) It is proposed to construct caravanserais at Rabidi and Bir Ibn Hasani on the road to Medina. This scheme is being promoted by Sir Nizamat Jung o Hyderabad who has contributed 4,000 rupees personally to a fund which he ^/l 1Sin ? 111 a J T. 'V i^ter of Finance has expressed warm approval T pes i lf S u ir Nizamat Jung's fund does not suffice, other will brcommlmorateT 7 COmplete the work h y addin g ri » m s, in which their names(d) Improvements in other directions, e.g., in connexion with the pilgrimage tariiif and the provision of repair facilities for motor cars, will be mentioned in subsequent sections. 13. The exchange value of the riyal again deteriorated to about 21 riyals to the gold pound. This suits the Government so long as they can collect payments due to them, for customs duty at gold rate, and make certain disbursements in riyals at the legal rate of 10 to the £ gold. The local exchange value of foreign currencies like rupees was for a short time menaced in March by rumours of a general collapse in Europe, as well as in the United States following on the banking crisis in the latter. There was an inclination in the bazaars to underquote the currency equivalent of rupees, but the action of the Legation, including an arrangement made by the Indian vice-consul with Messrs. Ali Ridha, the principal firm of shipping agents, averted any serious difficulty. 14. Prices of food-stuffs in riyals were rather lower than last year, but the general purchasing power of pilgrims was again low. 15. Security on the pilgrim roads was maintained at the high standard of recent years. There was a decrease in pilferage in the frequented centres. No cases of theft were reported at Jedda, and there were only a few instances of pocket-picking in the Haram or of pilferage at Arafat, Mina and Muzdalfa. 16. The King gave his usual banquet to leading pilgrims on the 31st March, and spoke on his usual theme of unity in Islam. His address, unlike some of his past utterances, was marked by an avoidance of anything likely to offend any section of his hearers. The most notable passage was one in which he defined his position as being that of a herald of Islam, but disclaimed any aspiration to the Caliphate, as no man at the present time could fulfil the condition of being able to enforce Islamic law throughout the whole world of Islam. Ali he desired was unity and co-operation among Moslems. He had at his back 400,000 warriors, who were the ' troops of unity.' 17. The Indian vice-consul was on this occasion invited to the banquet, but was prevented by business in Jedda from attending. The rapprochement noted in paragraph 17 of last year's report has, however, continued. Since May 1932 Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah has been in constant touch with the Minister of Finance, and, on the 14th May, 1933, he was received by the King, who allowed him to submit his views on various pilgrimage matters in the form of an unofficial memorandum. This led to a careful discussion between the vice-consul and the Minister of Finance on the 30th-31st May, after which the King again received Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah and expressed general approval of the results of the discussion. The matters dealt with will be adverted to in the appropriate sections of this report. The Malay pilgrimage officer was also received by the King by private arrangement in Mecca, and was given an opportunity of drawing His Majesty's attention to two subjects which he has much at heart. 18. Marked attention was shown to notable Indian pilgrims this year both by the King, to whose banquet many were invited, and by the Minister of Finance, who gave two large dinners of his own for leading pilgrims. At the first, he is said to have urged his guests to address any complaints direct to him rather than to the representatives of their Governments. The Indian vice-consul, who was present at the Minister's second dinner only, emphasises the considera tion shown this year to Indian pilgrims of the Shia creed, some of whom were detained and shown great honour after the other guests had departed. He infers a new desire to disarm Shia hostility to Wahhabi ascendency. Jemal Pasha Ghazi and a specially appointed mutawwif helped to maintain liaison and to arrange interviews between these leading Indian pilgrims and the King and his Minister of Finance. Exemptions from road tax were accorded in many cases, and in some free transport was provided, besides recommendations to the Governor of Medina and other officials. Two Indian pilgrims reciprocated the attention shown them by the unusual gesture of presenting the Minister of Finance with voluntary offerings for charity. Mr. Ibrahim Jewan Baksh of Calcutta gave 3,000 rupees, and Sir Rahim Baksh, K.C.I.E., late president of the Council of Regency in Bahawalpur, gave 2,000 rupees. The more normal direct distribution of alms led to one or two unfortunate incidents, including the crushing to death of an Indian woman pilgrim. Two of the largest benefactors were Mr. Ibrahim Jewan Baksh and Khan Bahadur Seyyid Ahmed Husein Bidawi of Lucknow.6 19. Besides the three persons just named, the following Indians of distinction made the Haj :— M. Nasrullah Khan, M.L.C., United Provinces; Khan Bahadur Qaim Uddin of Sind; Mian Mohammad Naqi, brother of His Holiness Mian Muhammad Taqi of Bareilly; Khan Bahadur Seyyid Ahmed Jiffry of Malabar; Khan Sahib Hajji Abdul Ghani, president of Karachi Hajj Committee; M. Hasan Ali P. Ibrahim, vice-president of Bombay Hajj Committee; Dr. Rajab Ali Patel of Bombay. The most notable Indian pilgrims who visited the Hejaz during the off season between the 1932 and 1933 pilgrimages were Mumtaz Ali Khan, second son of the Nawab of Maler Kotla; Khwaja Shahbuddin, brother to the Minister of Education in Bengal; and Dr. S. A. K. Jeelani, ex-M.L.A., Madras (see paragraph 7 (&amp;)). 20. Other pilgrims of distinction this year were the Amir of Katsina in Nigeria, with a numerous suite, the Amir of Qatar, two junior members of the ruling family of Bahrain, several Afghan diplomats, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Faiz Muhammad Khan, and Lady Evelyn Cobbold. 21. The only Indian agitators of known importance who came on Hajj this year were Hasrat Mohani and Ismail Surati. The most conspicuous absentees of this class were Ismail Ghuznavi and Muhammad Khan Ghazi Khan. The former was refused permission to leave India for the Hejaz for reasons connected with his anti-British activities and Communist attaches. This decision of the Government of India involved the Legation, and especially the Indian vice- consul, in some odium, although His Majesty's Minister had deprecated it on the grounds that it would indispose Ibn Saud and that Ismail Ghuznavi, whatever his politics, had in recent years been helpful in connexion with pilgrimage matters. A meeting of Indian pilgrims in the Haram after the pilgrimage adopted a resolution strongly criticising the ban imposed by the Government of India on this person. It is not known whether Muhammad Khan was also formally refused permission. He is of less interest to the Legation than Ismail Ghuznavi, but he is intimate with the Saudi Minister of Finance. 22. Another political suspect who made the Hajj was Ghulam Siddiq, a former Afghan diplomat and a brother to the Ghulam Nabi who was recently executed for complicity in a pro-Amanullah conspiracy in Afghanistan. 23. The arrangements for the dispersal of the overseas pilgrims worked satisfactorily, and the bulk of them were embarked within an unusually short period after the pilgrimage. The usual difficulties arose in connexion with destitutes, but on no spectacular scale, considering the badness of the times. Particular categories will be dealt with in the appropriate sections of this report. 24. H.M.S. Penzance (Commander A. R. Farquhar, D.S.C., R.N.) paid the usual Haj visit to Jedda. She stayed from the 1st April to the 8th April and took part in the annual regatta for the pilgrim fleet. Seven Somali naval ratings performed the pilgrimage. 25. The judicial authorities in Syria are still dealing with the matter of forged rupee notes. There has been no further circulation of such notes in the Hejaz. 26. Well over 2,000 Dutch East Indians who had remained in the Hejaz from previous pilgrimages and had become destitutes were repatriated after the 1933 pilgrimage at the joint expense of the Government of the Netherlands East Indies and a charitable fund. A much more modest effort to make a clearance of Malayan destitutes is recorded in paragraph 181. 27. No progress seems to have been made towards a settlement between Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Relations are not unfriendly, but there is no question at present of a resumption of the practice of sending a Sacred Caravan from Egypt. 28. The Afghan Government detached their consul at Bombay for service in Jedda during the pilgrimage. He obtained a formal exequatur as consul in Jedda, but stayed only from the 16th March to the 25th April. 29. The Kiswa or cover for the Kaaba was again made by Indian weavers in Mecca for this year's pilgrimage, probably in deference to the resentment in certain quarters at its having been imported from Germany in 1932. 30. No cases of the enslavement of pilgrims so definite as those mentioned in paragraph 33 of last year's report came to the notice of the Legation in 1933.I ! » I 11 I tei P I ■ 1932. 1933.

In one there was no evidence worth serious consideration. The other, which involved, among other people, a notorious slave broker in Jedda, seemed to merit more attention and is still under consideration, but it is doubtful whether it can usefully be pursued. (2) Statistics. 31. The following tables give the usual statistical information. It is possible, by the courtesy of the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, to give this year in Table (A) separate particulars of arrivals at Yanbu. The figures given are those compiled by the quarantine authorities, and probably the best obtainable, but there may still be discrepancies between them and those supplied from other sources, e.g., the Jedda figures for arrivals from India and the Far East are slightly in excess of those reported from Kamaran, a fact which may be partly due to the inclusion at the Jedda end of certain persons, like members of ships' crews, who do not embark as pilgrims, but take the opportunity of making the Haj. It will be seen that there was a notable falling off in the total number of nationals of the principal countries of origin, like India, the Dutch East Indies and Egypt, as well as in the number from Syria and Palestine. The number of Malayans, though showing a slight increase, is again almost negligible. The decline in the number from North Africa, exclusive of Egypt, is less marked than it would have been but for the presence of an unusually large number of Moroccans. The only countries of origin which show an important increase are Afghanistan, where there has been a definite stimulation of interest in the pilgrimage, and Persia, where it must be assumed that the attitude of the Government has been less adverse than in 1931 and 1932 ;— T able (A).

The usual quarantine arrangements were in force at Kamaran, Tor and Suakin during the pilgrimage season under review. Kamaran. 33. The proposal to amend the Indian Merchant Shipping Act so as to make vaccination and inoculation against cholera compulsory (see paragraph $5 of last year's report) had not taken effect before this year's pilgrimage. Nevertheless, the action of the authorities in India again produced the satis factory result that all pilgrims from India, like those from Java and Malaya, were, in fact, vaccinated and inoculated against cholera before embarkation. The only cases of infectious diseases known to the Legation to have occurred on board pilgrim ships before arriving at Kamaran, were a case of chicken -pox in the Akbar, which left Bombay on the 23rd January, and a case of suspected chicken-pox in the Khosru, which left Bombay on the 27th February. Tne former case was discovered before the ship reached Karachi, and the case was disembarked there. The second case was discovered before the ship reached Aden, where precautionary measures were taken. Mi' § 'IrjT- 34. In these circumstances, no ships from India, the Dutch East Indies and Malaya were detained tor more than the time required for medical examination. 35. Having verified to the best of his ability the declaration of the Saudi Government on the 11th April that the pilgrimage was clear, His Majesty's Minister dispensed ships returning to India and Malaya from calling at Kamaran. In view, however, of the prevalence some months previously of small-pox m certain parts of Arabia and reports of its existence on a moderately important scale, though not in any widespread epidemic form, at Medina and elsewhere m the Hejaz, he caused measures to be taken to guard against any recurrence of the incident mentioned in paragraphs 42 and 68 of last year's report. Steps were taken to ensure that only persons known to have been vaccinated within a reasonable past period should be embarked; 755 persons proceeding to Aden, Mokalla or India were newly vaccinated at the Indian dispensary attached to the Legation. Tor. 36. Returning pilgrim ships were subjected to the usual detention of three days. No cause for suspicion was detected. The Alexandria Quarantine Board declared the pilgrimage clean on the 17th April. Suakin. 37. Pilgrims returning by the Sudan to Africa underwent the usual five days detention at Suakin. No cause for suspicion was detected. The lack of first-class accommodation in the quarantine station at Suakin creates occasional difficulty. Special arrangements were made to overcome this in one case this year, that of Lady Evelyn Gobbold, who was allowed to undergo quarantine in hospital^ at Port Sudan. While drawing attention to this difficulty. His Majesty's Minister realises that cases seldom arise, and that it would be difficult in present financial circumstances to provide special accommodation. Jedda. 38. No quarantine measures were applied to pilgrim ships or pilgrims arriving at Jedda this year. A case of virulent small-pox, discovered in the steamship Akhar on her arrival on the 1st February, and a case of modified small-pox in the same ship on the 16th March was removed to the local hospital. 39. There has been no change in the quarantine establishment in the islands outside Jedda. Sir George Buchanan, principal Medical Officer of the Ministry of Health, was taken to see them during a private visit to Jedda in January, and was not greatly impressed by what he saw. The only use to which the islands were put this year was for the isolation of thirty licensed porters who had consorted with the crew of a British ship of the Ellerman Line, which had touched at Alexandria, a port infected with small-pox at the time. The immobilisation of these men caused inconvenience on the arrival of the steamship Rahmani on the 23rd February, and they had to be replaced by unlicensed substitutes. 40. The new pilgrimage tariff, discussed in section (9) below, provides for a charge of 9J piastres miri per head for boat hire in the case of pilgrims sent to the quarantine islands, with a surcharge of If piastres for each day in excess of three days' stay. 41. Two quarantine doctors were maintained as usual at Jedda, both Syrians. The senior, Dr. Yahya, is favourably regarded by the Legation. He went away soon after the pilgrimage, ostensibly on leave, but apparently not intending to return. This is the more to be regretted, as his subordinate, Dr. Ibrahim Adham, who performed most or all of the visits to pilgrim ships this year, has shown himself obstructive and dilatory. '' A little proud fellow.'' the Indian medical officer calls him, and cites a case in which his ignorance of the name of a nervous disease led him to insist, until a text-book was produced, that a pilgrim who had died of it on board must have been an infectious case. The Indian vice-consul suggests that this gentleman would be less dilatory if ^ ships' captains were requested to offer him lemonade instead of the cold beer to which he is partial. His Majesty's Minister doubts whether this remedy would diminish obstructiveness. 42. Dr. Muhammad Salih came to Jedda as representative of the Alexandria Quarantine Board, a capacity in which he has acted on several previous occasions,, [9002] c Act-' 010 though not in 1931 and 1932. He does not go beyond Jedda, owing to a difference some years ago with the Saudi Director-General of Public Health. (4) Health. General. 43. Health conditions, generally, were good throughout the 1933 season. Climatic conditions were even better than in 1932. Saudi Medical Service. 44. There was some numerical increase in the official medical personnel as compared with that of last year. The Indian Medical Officer supplies a list showing the following distribution during the season, except where certain other places were drawn upon to reinforce Mecca at the crucial moment of the actual pilgrimage:— Mecca.—Seven doctors, including the Director-General of Public Health; a municipal health officer and a X-ray specialist (a Hejazi, trained in Paris); also one dentist, one analyst, and one lady practitioner of some sort. Jedda. —Two quarantine doctors, one hospital doctor, and a lady practitioner or midwife. Medina. —Two doctors. Taif. —One doctor, who has been in Egypt for a time since the 1932 pilgrimage to study diseases of the eye, but has not yet been assigned for special work in that branch. Yanhu and Wejh. —A quarantine doctor at each, the man at Wejh being a recently-appointed Indian homoeopathist with some knowledge of allopathic medicine. Jizan. —Still vacant. 45. Of these 19 persons 12 are Syrians, 2 Hejazis, 3, including the 2 ladies, Egyptian, 1 Indian, and 1 Turkish. The list does not include the King's physician and three doctors at Riadh, Qatif and Hassa, which is served by an ex-clerk to the King's chauffeur, who has picked up some medical knowledge. Most of the doctors in the Hejaz were mobilised in Mecca for the actual pilgrimage, but it was not necessary to deplete other centres quite so completely as in 1932. The number of private practitioners and pharmacists remains very small, the principal addition being a Dutch doctor, who has established himself at Jedda on the strength of a minimum income being guaranteed for one year by the Dutch Legation and the two Dutch business concerns. 46. There is little to be added to the account given in paragraph 55 of last year's report regarding hospitals, &amp;c. The following further notes are based mainly on information supplied by the Indian medical officer :— Jedda. —No important change, but early in the year arrangements were made to improve the hospital and a fund was collected from the public, headed by the Amir Feysal, who gave £100. Only minor repairs were effected before the pilgrimage, but the major work has since been put in hand. Mecca. —No important change. The projected accommodation for X-ray work and maternity cases at the central hospital has been completed but not brought into use. A room for the new analyst is still under consideration. The sheds outside the town for infectious cases, which were maintained last year, were again not used. A small X-ray plant was imported some time ago, but was transported to Riadh. The specialist mentioned above worked there, but, although he was one of the outside doctors mobilised at Mecca for the actual pilgrimage, he was not employed there on X-ray work. He was to go to India this summer to take delivery of one X-ray apparatus promised by M. Jewan Baksh, who came on Haj this year and whose generosity in other directions has been mentioned elsewhere. Other Centres and Pilgrim Roads. —No important change in the arrange ments described last year, except for the provision of a small dispensary at Wejh, served by the newly-appointed Indian mentioned above. It has been closed since the pilgrimage. 47. It would appear from the above account that, apart from some improve ment in personnel, little has been done to remedy the defects noted in previousi gglliHy. 11 reports, and after the pilgrimage the service again showed a marked tendency to disintegrate. The condition of the medical service in the Hejaz certainly does not justify the glowing description of it given in the Saudi pilgrimage guide issued in Mecca last autumn (see paragraph 11). It is there stated that the medical and health services have been organised ' on good modern lines,' that fully qualified doctors, hospitals with special wards, dispensaries, roadside shelters, &amp;c., are provided, and that pilgrims may rest assured that the medical arrangements in the Hejaz are ' as perfect as anywhere else.' The guide also states that pilgrims can obtain free advice and medicines. The Indian medical officer reports that this statement proved quite illusory during the recent pilgrimage, that all medicines were charged for, that poor persons get no treatment, and that the well-to-do were sometimes treated gratis in the hope of their presenting substantial sums both to the hospital and to the doctors themselves. As regards the other facilities advertised in the guide. Dr. Abdul Hamid affirms that no special wards were available, and he cites two cases which tend to show that the hospital at Mecca was not provided with vaccine. In one of these cases one of the official doctors applied to Dr. Abdul Hamid for lymph with which to vaccinate his own children. 48. The Indian medical officer has prepared the following statement of cases treated and deaths in the Government hospitals during the ten months August to May 1933, from the weekly returns published in the local press. Figures for June and July cannot be included, as the present report is being prepared early : — Disease. Dysentery Paratyphoid ... Typhoid Puerperal fever Small-pox Measles Meningitis Leprosy Syphilis Diphtheria ... Malignant fever Dengue Consumption Water-pox and chicken-pox Tetanus 49. The figures in the foregoing paragraph are gi\en foi what the} aie worth The variations from vear to year are difficult to account for. In any case, the returns can give only a very partial idea of the prevalence of disease m a country where there are so few hospitals, and they present so few features 1 'e J to encourage people to rely on them, even if many orientals were not naturally inclined to shrink from official medical treatment. If the figures can be trusted, they show, in comparison with those given for a full twelve months last year, about the same amount for dysentery, with fewer deaths, and a decrease all along the line in most other instances, very noticeable m the case of small-pox, much less marked in the cases of syphilis and consumption. Disease during the Pilgrimage Season. _ ^ . , 50 There were no epidemics of contagious or infectious disease during t le 1933tason and no cases'or suspieion of plague or cholera ^^ anxie^ was felt in the Legation owing to reports that the serious outbieak ot small p ^ .

Chicken-pox was much less prevalent than in 1932 and no cases came to the notice of the Legation of the relanding at the instance of ships' doctors of pilgrims suffering from it {cf. paragraph 67 of last year's report). 51. There were practically no cases of sunstroke. The unusual dryness following on lack of rain in the Hejaz produced cracked lips and a certain prevalence of diseases like influenzal catarrh. There was also a certain amount of malaria due to the abundance of mosquitoes. Diarrhoea and dysentery were less prevalent than in 1932 and cases of typhoid and paratyphoid were rare. The Indian medical officer mentions the occurrence on a small scale among the [' population generally of mumps among both adults and children and of measles | 1 among children. j; 1 52. The president, Major J. Gilmour, M.C., commented in his report to the Alexandria International Quarantine Board on the small amount of sickness on board northbound ships calling at Tor after the pilgrimage. |&gt;' Mortality. 53. The Indian medical officer puts the mortality among pilgrims at 1 per cent, lower than last year, and estimates it at 0-8 per cent, only, both for Indians and others. Only two deaths were reported at Arafat, one being that of a child from Mecca. Deaths at Muna were estimated at twenty-three. None of the deaths were caused by infectious disease. In most cases they were due to debility or chronic maladies of an acute type. There were no deaths from motor accidents. See paragraph 18 as regards a death in Mecca due to over-crowding. General Sanitary Conditions. 54. There was little change in the conditions described in the previous reports, ending with paragraph 70 of the report for 1932. There had been unusually little rain in the Hejaz (although much in Nejd) during the months preceding the pilgrimage. Mosquitoes were, nevertheless, abundant, a fact which the Indian medical officer attributes to the badness of the latrines system. He remarks that, in the absence of restrictions, numerous tents were pitched this year close to the slaughtering place at Muna. Little was again done to control the disposal of carcases, but, after the bulk of the pilgrims had left, officers were sent to collect dried meat from African pilgrims of the poor Takruni type and to bur&gt; it. Dr. Abdul Hamid noticed outside his own house Bengali pilgrims of the pooier class cutting up and drying meat for use on their return journey. 00. I he temperature on Pilgrimage Day ranged between 74° F. and 94° F. Water Supply. 56. ^ Conditions generally were similar to those described in paragraph 72 of ast year s report. The Ain Zubeyda Committee continues to work efficiently, and has extended its system of canalisation. ^\ 1933 pilgrimage there was a fresh spurt of interest in the wa er a Wazinya, a potential source of supply to Jedda, which in the meanwhile con mues o depend on the adequate but costly output of its two condensers and a 5' Ce w lir - . mmor we ^ s - The Ain Zubeyda Committee were consulted egar mg azinya, and, though they are said to have objected to any call on their funds they inspected the supply there carefully.

The Jedda dispensary remained open throughout the year as usual. That at Mecca was opened this year on the 20th January, and closed rather earlier than usual on the 28th May. Dr. Muhammad Khan was again employed as temporary sub-assistant surgeon. The arrangements generally for the two dispensaries, including the concentration of all staff except one servant at Mecca during the height of the season and attendance at Muna and Arafat, were similar to those in 1932. 59. The Jedda dispensary was visited by Sir George Buchanan, Chief Medical Officer of the Ministry of Health, in January. He made the general suggestion that, although financial considerations still stand in the way of major improvements, notably as regards accommodation, another compounder and/or dresser might with advantage be added to the present permanent staff. The Government of India are being approached on this subject in anticipation of next year's pilgrimage. It is hoped that when financial conditions are easier the larger questions of accommodation at Jedda, Mecca and Muna will be reconsidered. The Government of India were able, in the meanwhile, to concede certain minor desiderata, such as the allowances for whitewashing and repairs suggested in paragraph 74 of the report for 1932, and advantage was taken of the sanction this year. 60. The Director-General of Public Health showed some inclination to hamper the work in Mecca this year, more particularly by his attitude towards Dr. Muhammad Khan, with whom he refused to deal on the ground that his appointment had not been regularised vis-a-vis the Saudi Government. He maintained more generally, in connexion with the Indian medical officer, that the Legation should notify each year to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs its intention to open the dispensary; that the qualifications of the staff should be stated; and that the Saudi authorities should inspect the premises, &amp;c., to ensure their suitability. This jealousy of certain Saudi authorities in regard to the status of the Legation doctors and the dispensary at Mecca is a factor to be reckoned with, but has not so far produced really serious difficulty, as the position that they form part of the Legation has been successfully maintained. The King himself is understood not to favour interference, and gave a sympathetic hearing to observations on the subject by the Indian vice-consul on the 31st May. A regulation on the practise of medicine, &amp;c., by unofficial doctors, &amp;c., was issued on the 8th June, 1933. It is not illiberal in form. It is too soon to judge whether any attempt will be made to impose Government control in consequence on doctors, &amp;c., attached to foreign diplomatic missions. Cases treated in the Indian Dispensaries. 61. The total number of cases treated at the Jedda dispensary from the 1st June, 1932, to the 31st May, 1933, was 44,914, as compared with 39,231 in the previous twelve months. Of them, 4,625, as compared with 3,250 in 1932, were treated during the pilgrimage season, i.e., from the 15th December, 1932, to the 31st May, 1933. The number of cases treated at Mecca from the 20th January, 1933, until the 28th May, was 12,125, as compared with 13,215 in 1932. Only 85 cases were treated at Muna this year. 62. Thirty-four indoor cases were treated this year, as compared with twenty-five in 1932. Any extension of this branch of work is still impossible owing to insufficiency of accommodation. Surgical work is hampered by this and by the lack of suitable assistant or other person to administer ansesthetics, with the result that the work is for the most part such as can be carried out with local ansesthesis. Dr. Abdul Hamid performed 164 major operations at Jedda and Mecca during the year ending the 31st May, and 709 minor operations, including extraction of teeth and opening of abscesses^ besides numerous intervenous injections. 63. The number of cases treated at the two dispensaries greatly exceeds the aggregate number treated in all the Saudi institutions in the Hejaz, as shown in official returns. The patients include large number of Hejazis, but in prevailing conditions of poverty the sums produced by the small charges collected for medicines from them who can afford to pay were again very small. The amount as collected in Jedda during the twelve months ending the 31st May, 1933, was 520 riyals. That collected in Mecca, where some little attempt was made to discourage indiscriminate free treatment, was only 60 riyals.64. The following table shows the percentage of the various diseases treated in the Indian dispensaries during the year ending the 31st May, 1933 :— Medical— Percentage. (1) Malaria and its complications ... 40-20 (2) Other fevers and infectious diseases... 0-5 (3) Urinary diseases, including syphilis and gonorrhoea ... ... ... 14-5 (4) Digestive troubles ... ... 10-4 (5) Circulatory diseases ... ... 1-6 (6) Respiratory diseases ... ... 15 (7) Nervous diseases ... ... ... 0-4 (8) Diseases of the locomotory system ... 0-3 (9) Women's diseases ... ... 4-0 (10) Children's diseases ... ... 4-8 (11) Eye, ear and throat diseases ... 6 8 (12) Deficiency diseases ... ... 0-06 Surgical— (13) Sinuses, fistulae, ulcers, &amp;c. ... ... 7-6 (14) Wounds and other contusions ... 6-37 (15) Hydrocele and hernia ... ... 0-5 (16) Cystitis, stone, &amp;c. ... ... 0-47 100 00 65. The Government of India authorised last year a charge to cover transport in cases where patients at Mecca are visited in their own quarters and can afford to pay. The charge was fixed in the Indian Government's Guide for Pilgrims at 5 rupees per visit, except in the case of indigent persons. Of seventy-eight outside visits made in 1933, nearly forty were unpaid, for reasons of poverty or because of the departure of the pilgrims. 66. The doctors experienced no difficulty this year from restrictions on the circulation of cars. 67. The difficulty, noted in paragraph 82 of last year's report, in connexion with requests by doctors taking part in the pilgrimage that their prescriptions should be made up at the Indian dispensary, did not recur in 1933. The Government of India had upheld the view that such requests should be disallowed. 68. The Government of India have recently agreed to give gazetted rank to their medical officer in Jedda, provided that the post is not held by officers less qualified than assistant surgeons in India. It will bear the title of ' Indian Medical Officer attached to His Majesty's Legation at Jedda.' 69. As regards publicity and sign-boards, see paragraph 163. Other Foreign Medical Assistance. 70. 1 he Egyptian medical mission was again reduced. It worked in Mecca, and its stay was greatly curtailed. The provision for Afghans was similar to that in 1932 and was very elementary. The Indian doctor employed spent only a short time at Mecca, when he worked in the hostel bought last year. He received no new medical supplies. 71. i he arrangements of the Netherlands Government appear to have been affected at least temporarily by the arrival in Jedda of a Dutch doctor named Hartman. 1 his gentleman is not officially employed, but he is guaranteed a minimum income by the Netherlands Legation, the Netherlands Trading Company or Dutch Bank and International Agencies (Limited), the successors of the old Van de Poll firm. If this experiment succeeds, the intention appears to be to employ a Moslem doctor at Mecca each year for the pilgrimage season, but to lely on Dr. Hartman in Jedda, where he has the use of the Legation dispensary. 72. A Syrian and a Persian doctor were attached to the French and Persian pilgrims. They did not appear to have any very definite official status and woiked privately among their own people, no dispensaries being opened. t ^ The Russian couple mentioned in paragraph 88 of last year's report left Jedda some time ago and have not been replaced. The Soviet Minister's wife _ oes some general dispensing work. A Russian dentist, who arrived some months ago, practices at the Legation.t ■; i * i last' I 15 1*^ (5) Internal Transport in the Hejaz. 74. This section deals only with the machinery of transport. All questions of charges are dealt with in section (9) below. Motor Transport. 75. There was no important change in 1933 in the organisation of motor transport and little improvement in the equipment as described in paragraph 90 of last year s report. One important improvement was, however, effected in ancillary arrangements. Stores of benzine, oil and spare parts and engineers with lorries at their disposal were provided at Rabigh and Bir Ibn Hasani on the road to Medina, and though not available at the outset of the season, were ready in time to serve the needs of the bulk of the pilgrims using it. An engineer with a lorry had already been installed at Shameysi on the Jedda-Mecca road and supplies of benzine, &amp;c., were made available at Umm Salam. These arrange ments not only enabled vehicles to be provisioned and repaired in case of need, but also provided means whereby stranded pilgrims could be conveyed to coffee shops. Before they were instituted some of the early-arriving pilgrims, mostly Javanese, suffered inconvenience of the kind mentioned in paragraph 91 of the last report. Cases are cited in which the bus journey between Jedda and Mecca took from twenty-four to forty-eight hours and one in which a bus took fourteen days to reach Mecca from Medina. 76. As in 1932 pilgrims generally were allowed to go from Mecca to Arafat by motor. The fixation of charges per car and per lorry, instead of per pilgrim, dispensed them from tedious formalities of examination and counting at Koshan stations. It is a cause of complaint, however, among pilgrims able to afford the high charges that, as the motors follow a special road and are not allowed to enter the central part of Muna, but have to be parked at a considerable distance, the passengers have to walk with their encumbrances to their lodging. Some complain also that owing to the timing arrangements they run the risk of having to omit certain rites. 77. The new hotels (see paragraph 12 {a)) were allowed to run cars provided by the Government and free of the control of the Naqaba, on the road between Mecca and Jedda and in the town of Mecca, where the general use of cars was again prohibited. 78. The future of motor transport may be much affected by the agreements mentioned in paragraph 7 {h) and paragraph 8 (a) above. The agreement with Dr. Jeelani contains a clause protecting the future Mecca-Jedda Railway from motor competition. The agreement with Sharqieh (Limited) aims at the use of Ford vehicles as the standard means of pilgrim transport, though it is doubtful how soon this will become effective as pilgrimages are small nowadays and there are said to be about a thousand vehicles in the hands of the Government and the transport companies. Their condition is poor, but it is doubtful whether in present conditions the transporters will be able to afford many new purchases. As regards service stations, the contract with Sharqieh binds the company to provide workshops at Mecca, Jedda, Medina and Riadh and other places to be agreed upon. The Indian vice-consul understands that it is hoped to arrange for repairing stations, with spare parts, &amp;c., at Shameysi and Umm Selam on the Mecca-Jedda road and at Mastura, Bir Ibn Hasani and Musajid on the road to Medina, as well as a shop for benzine, oil, &amp;c., at Tawil on the road between Jedda and Rabigh. Reference has been made in paragraph 12 {c) to the project for erecting caravanserais at Rabigh and Bir Ibn Hasani. 79. The Saudi Government produced no final reply to the representations made last year (see paragraph 94 of the 1932 report) regarding certain difficulties in connexion with motor transport; nor did the Legation press the matter, as the whole subject was known to be under consideration. Eventually, the following subjects were dealt with in the exchange of views between the Indian vice-consul and the Minister of Finance, under the auspices of the King, in May 1933 (see paragraph 17 above) :— (a) Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah drew attention to the hardship entailed by ■stopping cars twice, when leaving Mecca, to undergo separate formalities at the koshan office and the police station. He suggested that as the offices were u./o il I16 only some 20 metres apart, all the formalities should be accomplished at one spot. The Minister demurred, but eventually agreed to make arrangements which will apparently enable pilgrims to undergo all the formalities at the town gate and undertook to apply the 2,000 rupees presented by Sir Rahim Baksh to the construction of a shed sufficient to accommodate ten cars. As the formalities take some hours the protection from the sun thereby afforded will be a boon to pilgrims. The King is understood to have approved of this and to have directed that any balance of expenditure should be made up out of public funds. (b) Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah hammered out in close discussion with the Minister a series of agreed proposals for the better regulation of motor vehicles. They include the fixation of maximum times for journeys, four hours between Mecca and Jedda and twenty-four hours between Mecca and Medina; increased facilities on the lines indicated at the end of the preceding paragraph for repairs and for obtaining spare parts, &amp;c., the latter to be sold at the road stations at 20 per cent, above the usual price and this profit to go to the Treasury; and a system of reporting and registration to provide the Ministry of Finance, where a motor-traffic section will be instituted, with the means of controlling the efficiency of vehicles and penalising transporters whose service proves to be defective. If these arrangements are brought into operation, but this is no small 'if,' one of the results will be to do away with the present system of holding up cars at Jedda on the way from Mecca to Medina for prolonged individual inspection, &amp;c., which frequently delays pilgrims overnight in Jedda. (c) The vice-consul pursued the question mentioned in paragraph 93 (d) of last year's report, viz., the inconvenience caused by the existing regulation that every Medina-bound lorry should carry a sabee or mutawwif's assistant. This had been the subject of representations by the Legation to the Government. The Minister objected to a suggestion that, if the sabee must be carried, he should be included in the complement of passengers, arguing that this would entail loss on the transporters. He demurred also to a further suggestion by the vice-consul that the pilgrims should be left to decide whether they needed a sabee and that, if they did, they should contribute £3 for his transport, the Government on their side waiving koshan. The discussion was inconclusive. Camels. 80. There are again no special remarks to make under this head, except that a few complaints were received from pilgrims that they had been delayed on the roads owing to sickness or death resulting from the poor quality and starved condition of the animals. 81. It would appear that a considerable number of pilgrims travelled by camel in preference to motor transport for the sake of economy. The same motive caused some 500 Indian pilgrims to remain in Mecca in the expectation of being able to make the journey to Medina more cheaply after the 15th Safar (see paragraph 112 (a)), although the authorities, anxious to get koshan at the regular rate for pilgrims, tried to speed them up by putting it about, through their mutawwifs, that there would be no reduction this year. Cabs. 82. The general use of motors in the town of Mecca was again prohibited this year in the interests of the cab-owners. An exception in favour of the Government hotel is noted elsewhere. General. 83. No attempt was made this year to prevent pilgrims from travelling on foot between Mecca and Jedda, and many pilgrims travelled in this manner for reasons of poverty. The standing regulation which prohibits pilgrims from tra\elling on foot to and from Medina, appears to have been enforced with rigour on certain classes of pilgrims, although not on the poorest class, .Nigerians, &amp;c. The Indian vice-consul reports that posts were established on the roads to hold up pedestrians, and that some pilgrims were turned back half-way to Medina, only the most indigent being allowed to proceed Khan Bahadur ihsanullah relates an amusing tale of how an Afghan party got round the restrictions by getting possession by a trick of the rifles of three Nejdi soldierss' who held them up. They carried off the guards but left the rifles behind, with the result that the Nejdis were very glad to take to flight when thev prevailed on their captors to release them. 84. The question of purely internal transport can no longer be separated from that of trans-frontier overland transport. Considerable progress has been made towards an agreement between the Saudi and Iraqi Governments for the organisation of a motor route from Nejef to Medina via Hail. It is contemplated that the Iraqi cars shall transport the pilgrims as far as Medina, but no further, and that all passport, sanitary and other controls shall be centralised at Jumaima on the frontier. The route has been fully surveyed on the Iraq side, but not apparently on the Saudi side. The question of motor transport all the way has also excited interest in various quarters in India. The Legation was approached towards the end of 1932 by an official at Quetta, who proposed to bring a party of six to the Hejaz by private 'bus, and by a firm at Dehra Dun, who seemed to be projecting a commercial scheme. The attitude of the Saudi Government was too guarded for the Legation to give any encouragement to the applicants. In the event the Quetta party, minus the original applicant, motored as far as Bagdad. 85. Two enterprising Indians came overland independently from India on bicycles this year, the first experiments of the kind on record. One got as far as Al-Ula, where he was asked to pay customs duty on his machine, whereupon, being penniless, he either abandoned or smashed it and came on to Medina on foot. The other got to Medina, but on being asked to pay koshan for the onward journey to Mecca, was reduced to selling his bicycle for 5 rupees. One of the men returned by sea to India by the charity of a fellow-pilgrim; the Indian vice-consul arranged for the other to be taken as a ship's sweeper. 86. These developments emphasise the importance of measures being taken in India to control the movement of overland pilgrims. His Majesty's Minister doubts whether encouragement should be given to persons there wishing to organise commercial services, which would compete with the service from Iraq and might be much more difficult to organise efficiently. Another reason for taking measures to control the overland pilgrim is that the development of motor transport may stimulate the flow of pedestrian pilgrims, who would have known and frequented routes to follow, and who already swell the total of destitutes having to be repatriated to India at Government expense. (6) Customs. 87. Except for the one change noted in the following paragraph, the Customs Administration worked on the same lines during the 1933 pilgrimage season as in 1932. Venality and smuggling would still appear to be rife. The Indian vice-consul states that, owing to non-payment of salaries, officials were even readier to commit irregularities in return for tips and to be content with very small ones. The Government were, he says, driven to take drastic action to cope with the traffic in contraband tobacco, and adopted the method of burning it, when confiscated, instead of themselves selling it, with the object apparently of stimulating fresh imports on which duty would be paid. Stringent measures of control were instituted at Taif, an important distributing centre for smuggled tobacco. 88. Pilgrims were this year denied the facility previously enjoyed of leaving certain articles like tobacco and betel-nut in customs and retrieving them on departure. This year they were compelled to pay duty on them, under pain of forfeiture. This gave rise to much complaint on the part of pilgrims, but the new rule could not be contested officially by the Legation, and the efforts made on behalf of the pilgrims affected by Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah in high Saudi quarters were unavailing. 89. On the 4th May, shortly after the pilgrimage, the Saudi Government introduced an entirely new system of customs duties, superseding that of which a partial account was given in paragraph 100 of last year's report. Its most notable feature was the introduction of specific duties per unit on a large range of staple commodities, including food-stuffs, piece-goods, sugar and petroleum products. Ad valorem duties, at rates which in nearly all cases show a heavy increase on those previously levied, were retained for a limited number of com modities, including motor vehicles, perfumes, silk, raw and manufactured cotton and metal goods. The various small surtaxes previously imposed in certain cases r 9002] D (ittl)in addition to the old ad valorem duties were abolished. So far as it is possible to make comparative estimates, the specific duties seem a good deal more onerous than the old ad valorem rates. It is too soon to judge the effect of the new svstem with any exactitude or to forecast its reaction on internal prices. It aDofips tn the whole of Saudi Arabia. (7) Religious Policy. 90. The Indian vice-consul has observed this year a marked tendency in the direction of a more liberal policy towards Moslems, who do not accept the doctrines and rigours of Wahhabism. Although extremist influences have still to be reckoned with, others, especially in Mecca and Jedda, operate in a contrary sense for reasons of policy or finance. Little has been heard during the last year of the ' Committees of Virtue,' which have been at times a scourge to the local inhabitants. The Amir Feisal, who is permanent President of the Council of Ministers, and is Viceroy of the Hejaz during his father's absence from the Hejaz, is disposed towards liberalism by his training and personal tastes. 'Last year, when the whole situation was dominated by the aftermath of the Ibn Rifada rebellion, he was not powerful enough to prevent the temporary imprisonment at Taif of members of his own staff and other officials who took part in a musical party outside the town. He has since, however, curbed the over-zeal of the police, pushing tolerance to the length of opposing the arrest by them of loose women m Mecca, and ordering them to leave the control of such persons to the sheikhs of the quarters. The Minister of Finance, who is specially concerned with pilgrimage matters, is all for respect for the personal liberty of the foreign pilgrims, who bring grist to his mill. He has quoted to the Indian vice-consul the Koranic text which says : kt Let your religion be vours and mine be mine.' He represents the King as sharing his sentiments, and states that he is anxious to get permission to complete the restoration of the shrines in Medina, which were partly repaired last year, though without building domes on them. He would also like to encourage pilgrims to visit Taif, the only religious attraction or which is one particular shrine. 91. Mention is made in paragraph 18 of the consideration shown this year by the Minister of Finance to Shi'a pilgrims, and in paragraph 119 to the partial lemoyal of their grievance in respect of a charge which they regard as a discriminating tax. 92. The Governor of Medina is an elderly Wahhabi of the old school, but the expenence of numerous pilgrims has been that the Nejdi guards of the ophet s tomb, once so rigorous in the enforcement of the prohibition of practices like kissing the rail, are now very amenable to the influence of even the smallest tip, and will positively encourage those in a position to cross their palms with silver nyals, even to the extent sometimes of discreetly withdrawing a together while they perform their devotions. It may be noted that the official baudi pilgrimage guide, mentioned in paragraph 11, speaks of the visit to i e ma, at any rate in the English version, as though it were obligatory. • . cl rcumstances there have been few specific instances of intolerance m 1933. The following may be mentioned : . i P ai t&gt; i of Indian pilgrims, who went to Jebel Nur, was challenged by e i ej i guaids. Their cabmen and the mutawwif were lightly beaten with sticks although the latter tried to pass as a pilgrim by a quick change of clothing. 1 he pilgrims were pelted with stones. u- u ^disciple of Mian Muhammad Taqi complained that a religious book, wnch he was reading m the Haram at Mecca, was snatched from him by the - i authorities W hen eventually returned at the instance of the Indian vice consu , 1 a d had some pages torn out. On the other hand, a leading !v f 1 ^ f • rom _p ydciabad expressed admiration of the tolerance with which the wafregarded 0 SeV hundred copies of books, repugnant to the Wahhabi faith, n flra LH he in S 7 Ufi /r C ? ler P . ir Seyyid Jamat Ali Shah ' who was mentioned in Lf bl™ f i year s , re P ort ' a g am prayed apart at Medina. He does frL been seriously interfered with, although a threat of expulsion om the town was used to induce greater moderation on his part. removt* fhl f 10t ^ su PP osed that the greater toleration shown this year oi cucumspection on the part of pilgrims. Visits to shrines,es ' k 4.1 ^ St; 19 at Mecca othei than the Kaaba are still strongly discouraged, and the Indian vice -consul still recommends Indian pilgrims to avoid visiting shrines the frequentation ot which may involve them in unpleasant incidents. It mav be mentioned as an example of another kind of intolerance that, soon after the pilgrimage, an elderly Indian merchant belonging to the Ahmadiyya community, who has lived m the xiejaz for many years and whose family have been connected with it tor centuries, was ordered to leave the country at a month's notice owing: to an allegation that he had preached heresy. (8) Mutawwifs. 95. Apart from the charge mentioned in paragraph 101 below, there was no radical alteration in the system of mutawwifs, wakils and muzawwars, to tttollf which much attention has been given in previous reports. The control exercised ; by the Saudi authorities and the pressure or influence exercised by the Legation i over the first two categories have induced a greater source of responsibility, and iftlelilj there were few complaints this year of their conduct in the Hejaz. 96. The Legation black list system has continued to operate as a restraint on the mutawwifs concerned with Indian pilgrims. It must, however, be applied with discretion, in order to preserve the salutary effect of blacklisting, and thereby } r excluding temporarily from India a limited number of persons clearly and d conspicuously guilty of abuses, without permanently debarring them from the j. exercise of their profession, except when they appear to be incurable. The ■ of tlft knowledge that the penalty may be inflicted makes it possible to settle a certain idling number of minor cases in which the conduct of mutawwifs, &amp;c., has given rise to complaint. Any excessive extension of the system would entail the risk of controversy with the Saudi Government, and might drive them, on their part, to extend the operation of the Taqrir system, and might also give rise to suggestions in hostile Moslem circles that British authorities were seeking to impede the pilgrimage. The Legation has hitherto refrained from including in the black list mutawwifs' assistants or sabees, both because they are not persons of established status like the mutawwifs themselves and can easily be replaced, and 11^. also in view of the undesirability of expanding the annual black lists unduly. In deference, however, to the views of certain authorities in India, one or two sabees guilty of grave personal misconduct have been included in the list for 1934. Still, His Majesty's Minister sees no objection to this, provided that no attempt is made to include persons on the ground that they are related to or act as sabees for undesirable mutawwifs, a course which, in his opinion, would overburden the lists without producing any equivalent beneficial result. The black list and lists of recommended mutawwifs for 1934 were sent to the Government of India on the 17th June, 1933. 97. It was hoped last year that the Government of India would receive legislative powers to control under a licensing system the activities in India of ' mutawwifs and others concerned with pilgrims. A select committee of the Legislative Council recommended, however, the indefinite postponement of the Bill introduced for the purpose. 98. The Indian vice-consul suggests that the black list should be included If in the guide for pilgrims issued by the Government of India, and should be its' posted in pilgrimage offices, &amp;c., in India. His Majesty's Minister has felt laeofiil unable to endorse this suggestion, as he considers it undesirable in itself and possibly open to legal objections. It would, however, be of advantage if administrative action could be taken in India (a) to control as far as may be possible, in the absence of special legislation, the proceedings of Indians gfii indulging in undesirable practices in connexion with the pilgrim traffic, and (h) to continue to impress upon intending pilgrims, in their own interest, the importance of engaging recommended mutawwifs and of being guided by the advice of the Indian vice-consul on arrival in Jedda. 99. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah cites the following instances of malpractice ]p| this year :— {a) Certain mutawwifs, having deluded pilgrims with promises of reduced fees, left their pilgrims and went on to Mecca on arrival in Jedda, after instructing their wakils to collect the full amount. In some cases in which they had entered into written agreements, they found means to recover these and [ ■ [9002] D 2 I 1 iiMiikacti 1 ]k ed' Tb destroy them. Torn pieces of such agreements were brought to Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, but were too incomplete to afford a basis for action. (b) There were a few cases, of the kind mentioned in paragraph 124 of last year's report, in which mutawwifs obtained loans from pilgrims or obtained cash from them in return for Hundis drawn on the mutawwifs relatives in Mecca. In one instance a sabee got a loan of 150 rupees from a Bengali pilgrim, who died on the voyage. The Indian vice-consul made strenuous efforts to recover the amount, but failed, owing to the sabee's impecuniosity. He was compelled to give a receipt, and it is hoped to recover the money eventually. In the meantime this sabee has been blacklisted (see paragraph 96 above) as an exceptional measure. (c) A leading advocate of Lucknow and his party complained that a Hamladar of that locality contracted with them for the Haj, including food and transport charges, and disappeared for a day or two after receiving the agreed amount. He then extracted from them a loan of 800 rupees, which there is little chance of their recovering. j 100. The Indian vice-consul has received representations from various people in India, e.g., a benevolent society in Karachi, the editor of the Wahid newspaper and two business houses in Lahore, complaining of the activities of mutawwifs in India, and urging that they should be prevented from going there. Another correspondent sent him, with a similar appeal, a cutting from the Ajmal , r; of the 14th February regarding the scandal of disputes between mutawwifs, &amp;c., ■ ¥V0I at railway stations and musafirkhanes. 101. One object which the vice-consul has long had at heart was the appointment in time for this year's pilgrimage (see paragraph 119 of the 1932 jf report) of a separate sheikh of mutawwifs for Indian pilgrims. The person ^ chosen was a person of Indian origin named Abdur-Rahman Mazhar, who is employed for certain purposes by the Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs. He has proved satisfactory so far and has been of assistance to the vice-consul and to pilgrims. 102. There has been no change in Taqrir system (see paragraph 121 of the last report), to which certain Indian pilgrims, like those from Malabar, Madras and Behar and those of the Memon community, are subject. It is very desirable that it should be abolished, but the matter is still considered too delicate for official action. 103. The object of mutawwifs' dues generally, the attempt made this year to compel payment in advance on arrival in Jedda and proposed new methods for collecting them are dealt with in the following section. Cases again arose this year, similar to those described in paragraph 123 of the last report, in which pilgrims, although in possession of return tickets, were without means to pay the dues. His Majesty's Minister adheres to his attitude that pilgrims should receive no encouragement to evade payment and that the Legation cannot intervene officially. The mutawwifs themselves were, however, disinclined to detain pilgrims, having regard to the relations between the Indian vice-consul and the Minister of Finance, and the vice-consul was able to arrange with the mutawwifs to accept part-payment or, in cases of extreme indigence, to let the pilgrims off altogether. 104. Nothing of interest has come to the notice of the Legation in connexion with the sheikhs who perform the duties of mutawwifs for non-Indian pilgrims; except a complaint from the Sudan of alleged extortion by the sheikhs who look after African pilgrims. These complaints are still under examination at the time of writing. 105. The Indian vice-consul draws particular attention this year to the importance of a greater control of the muzawwars or local pilgrim guides at Medina. These persons are normally not amenable to any pressure that the Legation can exercise, as they have established rights in the various categories of pilgrims and have no occasion to go to India to compete for patronage. One opportunity was afforded this year of getting back on an erring muzawwar, but it was exceptional. The muzawwar concerned had taken an Indian pilgrim into his employment in 1930, and had swindled him by representing him to the authorities as a lunatic. There was no redress until the muzawwar's son wished to go to India on business, when the father was forced to refund £9 gold. 106. One prospective reform in connexion with muzawwars is noted in paragraph 122 {e) of the following section. The Indian vice-consul suggests that lym P losed t Iprinci i an a( i Eai iporatic sb ca lelmei liionto ®ty foi 'm k ■'Ussm sab 'opos irt o i^year lipav] Wc kll11': I « (tilj | in it'i ! ' 5 I it would have a useful effect on these local guides, and generally, if he were allowed to visit Medina once a year and sanction were given for the small expenditure necessary, in addition to his present allowance for journeys to Mecca. 107. The exchange of news between the Indian vice-consul and the Minister of Finance under the auspices of the King (see paragraph 17) included the following matters, which are relevant to this section :— (a) The vice-consul renewed previous representations relative to the wakils who act for mutawwifs in Jedda. The most important desiderata, as regards Indian pilgrims, are that the Naqib, or head of the guild of wakils responsible for them, should be an independent person; that wakils should be compelled to confine themselves to pilgrims of one category; and that wakils should attend to their own business in Jedda, instead of deputing others. Particular examples ol the prevailing abuses were given in paragraph 58 of the report for 1930. When the matter was raised with the Minister of Finance this year he seemed reluctan to take action, but eventually agreed to the Indian vice-consul's proposals under the three heads just mentioned. If the reform is effected only female wakils will be allowed to employ substitutes to act for them. . , , . (b) The vice-consul drew attention to the scandal caused by the misbehaviour of mutawwifs, &amp;c., in India, including their quarrelsome behaviour during the assembling of the pilgrims there (see paragraph 100). It was agreed that the Saudi Government should require mutawwifs to return to this country reasonab y early in the season, the final recommendation being that they should not remain there beyond the departure of the first pilgrim ship sailing after the end of Ramadhan. 108. The following two matters are included in this section, although they are only indirectly connected with its main subject. (a) The Saudi Government have certain committees in Mecca, who are suonosed to look after the interests of pilgrims, listen to their grievances, &amp;c. The nrincipal committee, known as the Haj Committee, has for some time past been an administrative body presided over by the Secretary of the Legislative Prmnpil \ decree published on the 2nd June. 1933, substitutes lor mis a superior Hai Committee composed of the three sheikhs of mutawwifs for Dutch East Indians and miscellaneous pilgrims respectively and two members of each of the separate committees of those three corporations. The new o y is to hear on appeal matters which cannot be settled by the committees of the fornorations oX the committee of the Medina guides. It is also to deal with disputes between mutawwifs and camelmen; and, on . tViArmrvpvnr^ of Zemzem water, which cannot be settled by tUeir own commiLLee, ordinary^ travellers C ° o^igormis 'forn^ities^which ^enS^^e ^lomination^ ^ is ^ s views alreadv ™e^t^ned^he Indian vice^consm^s ^ ^ a proposal that a pilgiim staying J h . mutawwI f an d depart on P^ 10 ' ^f^wwif! to fhleflSt that'there are, no claims endorsed F atl ® not married in Mecca; and that a pilgrim staying against him and that he has . . 0I1 production of a similar certificate two years or more ^ould be al owed to^o on pr ^ ^ ^ ^ whether tht Sm wfici would rnv P olve P a considerable change in the existing passport law, will go through. (9) Pilgrimage Tariff and Cost of Pilgrimage. ^ + i ir. r^raoTPmh 145 of the report for last year that, 109. It was stated JLprihprl in the preceding paragraphs, the following on the acute controversy comprehensive tariff principal charges rn th. li 118 rt,!i if nKsystem followed, as distinct from the details, were the fixation of all charo -es i Saudi currency, i.e., ' piastres miri' computed on a gold basis, and the fixatio of definite rates for transport by camel and motor. The use of a single currenov basis must be regarded as a satisfactory reform from the point of view of elaritv although it has the natural corollary that the actual cost to pilgrims from countries not on the gold standard is liable to be affected by exchange fluctuations. 110. The early fixation of the charges for transport during the pilgrimage season redressed a grievance which has been acutely felt in the past, when charges were not definitely framed until after many pilgrims were already' in the Heiaz It is still a cause of complaint that some of the charges are high, notably those for the journey to Medina. They continue to be inflated by the inclusion of heavy Government taxation. 111. In view of its importance and the probability that it will be applied in 1934 without substantial alteration the 1933 tariff is reproduced as an appendix to this report. It will be noted that the explanatory notes embodied in it deal with several questions of principle. The tariff did not include the charges for motor transport from Mecca to Arafat and back. These were fixed separately shortly before Pilgrimage Day at inclusive rates, not per pilgrim, but per car nr lorry, as follows : — Mecca to Arafat and back by lorry : £13 gold. Mecca to x \rafat and back by car : £9 gold. Half of these amounts is understood to be for the Government road-tax or koshan. 112. The burden of the charges for transport to Medina is mitigated in certain cases, for pilgrims proceeding thither after the pilgrimage, in two ways, {a) Ihe official rates and the control of the iNaqaba are maintained only up to the 15th Safar. Pilgrims going to Medina after that date pay a much lower koshan and may be carried at lower -rate for actual transport once the enforcement of the fixed tariff by the Naqaba ceases and competition between transports comes into play {b) An ex gratia concession not provided for in the tariff was made this year after the first rush of pilgrims had left Mecca. Those departing later were allowed to take single tickets to Medina at half the legal rate for J 11 l ou ™ e y- j Thls enabled those returning to Jedda after the otn batar to take advantage of the cheaper rates mentioned at (a) ^ le ex P^ anat ^ ns attac hed to the tariff maintained one anomaly of return tirf-p N tS Medl i la be ^ re p ilg'mage Day complain.

The Indian vice-consul suggests that there was, in fact, an increase amounting m the case ot noimal Indian pilgrims to about 3 rupees at gold rate, if account be taken ot cei tain cnarges distributed over the new tariff, but formerly covered by the mutawwifs fee. He reckons that the normal mutawwif's fee for Indians, not including house rent at Mecca and tent hire at Arafat and Mina worked out at 24 rupees at gold rate. He sets against this the following items in the new tariff:— No. 7. No. 15. No. 17. No. 18. No. 19. No. 28.

Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah gives the foregoing result as that arrived at by 'those who were versed in the science of numbers,' and it is reproduced without further comment. Whatever criticism may be directed against the new tariff it constitutes a great advance in the direction of fixity, all the more so as the Government adhered faithfully to the undertaking given when it was published that it would not be altered. It enabled the Legation to prepare a much more satisfactory estimate of the probable cost of the pilgrimage and to forward it to the Government of India on the 6th October, after it had been agreed unofficially by the Saudi Minister of Finance. The general tariff had already been circulated on the 19th September to that and other British Governments interested in the pilgrimage. 117. The Legation estimate was in due course given general circulation in India and was reproduced in the guide for pilgrims, published by the Govern ment of India early in 1933. The Government of Bengal modified the estimate somewhat for purposes of publication in that province. The estimate does not appear to have received serious criticism in Indian Moslem circles, but many pilgrims nevertheless arrived at Jedda with insufficient funds. This may be attributed in some measures to the activities of propagandists over-eager to advertise a 'cheap ' pilgrimage. Thus Jemal Pasha Ghazzi (see paragraph 11) circulated broadsheets in which he gave figures which could not be described as false, but which gave no complete picture of the total necessary expenditure. He thus arrived at estimates apparently lower than those of the Legation, and he is alleged to have given still lower estimates in oral statements. 118. An inclusive charge of £18 gold is fixed in the tariff for Javanese pilgrims contracting with mutawwifs to pay a lump sum in respect of all dues, fees and transport charges from the moment of landing at the quay in Jedda to the moment of embarking there. This would also apply to Malayan pilgrims, who are assimilated by the Saudi Government to Javanese, but who do not, in fact, make much use of the contract system. 119. Another note to the tariff reads as follows : ' Certain pilgrims prefer to remove the roof of the lorry when wearing Ihram. In such cases the pilgrim will have to pay half an English gold pound for this purpose.' This maintains as regards lorries, the practice mentioned in paragraph 111 of the report for 1932 of levving on Shia pilgrims to Medina a charge of ICte. gold, which they regard as a discriminating tax and greatly resent. As the tax was formerly charged even to those travelling by camels, there was some ground for this grievance. During the 1933 season the Minister of Finance agreed to exempt Indian Shia pilgrims travelling by small cars from the tax, and he afterwards extended it to alt Shia pilgrims using such cars, but he would make no concession in favour of those using lorries. 120 It was prescribed in the notes to the tariff that all dues, other than rates and transport charges, must be paid by pilgrims on arrival at Jedda to the wakils there of their mutawwifs. The enforcement of this rule on the earlier arrivals created much difficulty in which the Legation was involved. It raises a very thorny question. On the one hand it may seem equitable that payment should24 be ensured rather than that pilgrims should get away to Mecca and seek to evade the full payment on grounds of lack of funds once they have accomplished their mam obiect On the other hand, it is undesirable that pilgrims should be detained in Jedda, as happened early in the 1933 season to certain pilgrims, who resisted payment in advance. There was a time when it was thought that some pilgrims might have to re-embark without making the pilgrimage. This would have suited the Saudi Government as little as the Legation, and, although the latter could not intervene officially, the former eventually relaxed the rule, subject to obtaining guarantees from the mutawwifs for the payment of moneys accruing to the Government themselves. In the event only one party proceeded to India without making the Haj. This was a family who had performed it 111 1932 and had -one to Palestine. They resented payment of further dues m 1933. The Legation could not uphold them in a claim to exemption, and they elected to return to India without making a second pilgi image. - , ,1 j 121. The following incidental factors m the problem just stated deserve mention :— (a) Mutawwifs undoubtedly suffered somewhat by the eventual non- enforcement of the rule, as they get less than their dues from some of the poorer pilgrims and nevertheless have to satisfy the exigencies of the Government. They appear, however, to accept this philosophically on the ground that they are glad to get anything and may hope to do well out of richer pilgrims ^ {b) It is urged against payment in advance that mutawwits are less attentive to pilgrims once they have collected their dues. ic) For a time the police on the road to Mecca had instructions to turn back pilorims seeking to evade payment by proceeding on foot and thereby escaping more easily the vigilance of* the wakils. This led to some corruption of the police. Ultimately the measures to turn back pedestrian pilgrims were cancelled. 122. The exchange of views between the Indian vice-consul and the Minister of Finance, under the King's auspices, in May 1933 (see paragraph 17) included the following matters which are relevant to the subject ot this section :— (a) The vice-consul drew attention to the desirability of making any estimates of expenditure circulated in India on behalf of the Saudi Governmen to harmonise with the estimates prepared by the Legation for the Government ot India. The Minister agreed generally and asked to be furnished with copies of the Legation estimates, which the vice-consul promised to provide. Ihe Minister intimated that the Saudi tariff for 1934 would not ditter matenall} from that for 1933. . i , -i -t™ {b) The vice-consul drew attention to the difficulty experienced by pilgrims compelled to stay the night in Jedda on the way from Mecca to Medina, owing to the fact that^the Jedda wakils are not responsible for their accommodation at this point in their journeys. He at first suggested that arrangements siiouia be made to make the wakils responsible in return for a small fee. Ine matte was not pursued as it is hoped that new transport arrangements (see P ar ^ graph 75) will do away with the necessity for a halt overnight in Jedda on way from Mecca to Medina. _ , , r - (c) The vice-consul drew attention to the case of pilgrims who, naving completed the pilgrimage journeys and returned to Jedda to arrange tor nome- ward passages, may have to wait for steamers and prefer to fill m time 7 returning to Mecca. He asked that they should be allowed to per orni further journey to Mecca at the same rate of koshan as is ordinarily cnarg to natives of the country. The Minister agreed to grant this facility witn ene from the 15th Zil-Hijja in each year. , , (d) The vice-consul drew attention to the difficulty caused by the rule u mutawwifs' fees should be collected in advance on the pilgrims arriva Jedda, especially that mentioned in paragraph 121 (h) above. There eme g from this discussion an entirely new proposal, in which Khan -ban Ihsanullah reluctantly acquiesced. It was to separate the payments 1 ^ clu ^ e , , paragraph 115 above' into two parts, that accruing to the Government ana _ accruing to the mutawwif as personal remuneration and to make the slupp companies responsible for the collection of the former, except in the case ires: It#! |()Tle jki i pis, ui jjtofi- ijlalu frto p. a 1 ml rest SlS 3S t( ild be iliut illy bei feted fctal a ilk fi didig is in to hand kla fi iigelefc rat as pgco: it Id his ^ its of ^ ister f( is, to iitory . \%. ®tion r ^atior sard ea ttsof pit for It, h,wi No 2 ^S11C( Covert lion's ^year |^ 4 nevsitj .atfei iwiii i audi fe leGoift® slipd fill! •25 pilgrims from est Africa and the Sudan, in the same way that they at present collect quarantine dues when issuing tickets. The Minister of Finance expressed the intention of reducing the total amount of 187 piastres under item 28 of the tariff to 1/4 piastres, divided into 104 piastres payable to the Government and 70 piastres for the mutawwif. The shipping companies would thus be asked to collect with passage money an inclusive sum of 137^ piastres in respect of the items enumerated in paragraph 115 above. It is apparently also intended to generalise the application of these revised rates by extending them to all Indian and Afghan pilgrims and perhaps others. The views of His Majesty's Minister are given in the following paragraph :— [e) The vice-consul urged the fixation of a definite fee for the muzawwars at Medina. Some of these have been guilty of grave abuses in the past. They work, except apparently in the case of Dutch East Indian and Malayan pilgrims, under a taqrir system, i.e., pilgrims from particular places of origin are assigned compulsorily to particular muzawwars. The Minister of Finance agreed to fix a fee of 16 piastres, not inclusive of house rent. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah estimates that this will effect a substantial reduction in the amount hitherto estimated by the Legation for muzawwar's fee and house rent at Medina. 123. If the Saudi Government fulfil the promises enumerated above, the general result will be satisfactory. His Majesty's Minister has, however, grave doubts as to the proposal at {d) in the preceding paragraph. If put into effect it would be in the true interest of most British pilgrims. The reduction of the normal mutawwif's fee of 187 piastres to sums totalling 174 piastres would probably benefit a larger number of British pilgrims than the number who would be affected by a general levelling-up of fees. This would in itself have an incidental advantage inasmuch as Afghans would pay the same rate as Indians from the frontier districts, who have complained of being charged more than their Afghan next door neighbours. There would be less trouble on the arrival of pilgrims in Jedda and the stranglehold of mutawwifs would be relaxed. On the other hand, it is doubtful whether shipping companies would be willing to collect a further 134-| piastres on behalf of the Government and this extra charge before leaving the country of origin might easily be represented to the ignorant as a burden imposed by the Government of those countries or the shipping companies. Sir Andrew Ryan told Ibn Saud personally on the 11th June that in his opinion the proposal required further careful examination from many points of view. He gathered from subsequent conversation with the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Government were likely, for their own reasons, to disallow the proposal of the Minister of Finance. (10) Indian Pilgrimage. Prefatory Note. 124. Shortly after the despatch of the pilgrimage report for 1932 the Legation received from the Government of India a paper containing detailed observations on the reports for 1930 and 1931, which it had not been possible to forward earlier owing to the preoccupation of the authorities concerned with the reports of the Haj Enquiry Committee. Similar observations on the pilgrimage report for 1932 were received in March and April 1933. The Legation is greatly indebted to the Government of India for the close attention given to the three reports, which covered a most important formative period and for the anxiety shown to give effect to its views as far as possible. An endeavour has been made in the present report to take account of the observations of the Government of India on its predecessors. Owing to the great number of matters discussed and various local vicissitudes in Jedda, it is possible that this endeavour has not been com pletely successful. His Majesty's Minister, who is in separate correspondence with the Government of India on the subject, proposes, if other work permits, to review early in 1934 the position reached in regard to questions concerning the Legation as a result of consideration of the Haj Enquiry Committee's reports and the Legation's annual reports. His general view is that an attempt should be made next year to consolidate the results obtained since the creation of the Haj Enquiry [9002] E26 (: ' Committee before embarking on proposals for further improvement. In the present report he has avoided putting forward fresh proposals which might require action in new directions in India. Statistics {wp to end of June 1933). 125. The first Indian pilgrims arrived in the steamship Akhar, which reached Jedda on the 14th December, 1932. The arrivals ended with that of the steamship Rizwani on the 30th March. 126. The following table shows the number of pilgrims from each province of India and from Ceylon, classified according to ports of embarkation B ritish Subjects. Province. Bombay. Karachi. Calcutta.

The total is 3,161 as compared with 3,996 in 1932. Afghans were mainly responsible for the increase. It is noteworthy that, out of a total of 607 Persian pilgrims, only seventy-seven came via India^ 127. The discrepancy between the foregoing total and those given in paragraph 31 above is due to the fact that the figure in paragraph 31 includes Indian pilgrims from embarkation ports other than those in India and that the present statement has been compiled from lists of pilgrims, whereas those in paragraph 31 have been compiled from information supplied by quarantine authorities whose basis of compilation is somewhat different. The present table puts the total number of pilgrims from British India, the Native States and Ceylon at 6,697, as compared with 9,503 of last year. All provinces, except the United Provinces and Madras, show a decline, in most cases very marked. 128. The following list shows the number of non-Indian pilgrims who travelled to the Hejaz via Indian ports :— r312 , 13 j li • , 25 kin i 9 %in Nai/' % 27 130. According to information obtained from the mutawwifs, the numbers of Indian pilgrims who arrived from other than Indian ports was as follows : — I Suez Port Sudan Beirut ... Massawa Aden ... East Africa Dutch East Indies and Malaya Hodeida 156 41 13 15 26 16 6 5 278 It is estimated that, in addition to the above, about 300 Indians came overland on foot via Nejd, Yemen, Iraq and Palestine. Almost all of these were indigent and had to be eventually repatriated at the expense of the Government of India. 131. The Mogul Line (Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co.) was again the only line engaged in the pilgrimage traffic from India this year. 132. The following table shows the movement of return traffic with details of the number of ships available on given dates for repatriation of pilgrims, the number of pilgrims awaiting repatriation and the number actually repatriated :— Dates.

( 3 ) This figure includes 263 destitutes who originally came overland, and 462 Hadramis, &amp;c. f who either arrived by other ships or had been resident in the Hejaz. If these numbeis bt deducted from the figure for homeward-bound pilgrims the disparity between it and the number of arrivals amounts to 829, made up of 621 persons whose return tickets are still held in deposit m the Legation, and 108 others, mainly Hejazis returning from India and remaining in the Hejaz, or pilgrims who went northward to visit other holy places. Tfitl;; 134. The following table shows the distribution of the totals given in the preceding paragraph by ports of embarkation and destination. The number of arrivals at Bombay and Karachi cannot, however, be vouched for, as some [9002] E 2 is (Wt)28 pilgrims booked as passengers for Bombay Karachi rather than continue the sea voyage Port.

The following is a statement of the number of pilgrims who purchased single and return tickets in India, or deposited the amount of the return passage :— Port. Bombay Karachi Calcutta Single. Return.

It is satisfactory to note that very few single tickets were issued to British Indians of the type who are apt to become destitute in the Hejaz. None were issued to British Indians at Karachi, and of 31 who took single tickets at Bombay the majority were well-to-do pilgrims travelling first and second-class. Rather less caution seems to have been used at Calcutta, as five out of ten single tickets taken there by British Indians were issued to apparently poor persons. Return of Pilgrims to India: General. 139. The shipping provided for returning pilgrims was quite adequate for the reduced numbers involved this year. The table in paragraph 132 above shows that after the 16th April, only twelve days after Pilgrimage Day, there was no congestion in Jedda, and ships were more apt to have to wait for pilgrims than the reverse. In one case, however, that of the Jehangir, waiting pilgrims made a clamour because the ship was standing by for further arrivals from Medina. It was arranged to ante-date her departure by three days, and the complement was made up by including in it a number of destitutes who had to be repatriated. 140. The competent authorities in India and the Legation have continued to give much attention to the three more or less connected problems discussed in paragraphs 161 to 163 of last year's report, viz. :— {a) Whether the difficulties experienced by first and second-class passengers in getting early passages in those classes in ships returning to India can be overcome; derati 3 the I ■k of issed i iff the siiswer ( tfiy i: Jwnclin iig a: 'ms di: Mmei 114, iiisfactor ^ with lament toien fcim % ti H shir h it fens V29 (b) Whether arrangements can be made to enable first and second-class passengers to book their return passages by letter or telegram from Mecca or Medina; and, (c) What means can be found to relieve Indian pilgrims generally of the necessity for waiting for long periods in Jedda in congested conditions. , &lt; i i Owing to the smallness of the pilgrimage and the adequacy of the shipping available, none of these problems was so acute in 1933 as in previous years, but it will be convenient to sum up the main conclusions which emerge from the correspondence up to date. 141. As regards {a), Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co. have expressed their inability to increase the first and second-class accommodation in their existing fleet of steamers, and they doubt the commercial feasibility of another scheme which they have had under consideration, viz., the running of a special steamer for first and second-class passengers only. Meanwhile, the number of pilgrims holding first and second-class return tickets, who elected to travel in a lower class this year in order to avoid delay, fell this year to twenty-three. The Indian vice- consul attributes this in part to the fact that some pilgrims, aware of the difficulties that have arisen, preferred to travel from India to Jedda on single tickets. 142. The problem at (b) has receded somewhat into the background, no practical scheme having been devised to overcome the difficulties surrounding any proposal to alter present arrangements. The problem in any case merges to some extent in that at (c). 143. As regards (c), the Standing Haj j Committee of the Indian Legislature expressed the opinion on the 25th February, 1933, (i) that no attempt should be made to induce pilgrims to stay behind at Mecca or Medina after the pilgrimage, (ii) that certain arrangements, which had been suggested by the Legation, for the publication of shipping news in Mecca and Medina, should be made, and (iii) that consideration should be given to the possibility of enabling pilgrims to book their passages through an agent of the shipping company at Mecca. The Government of India endorsed the opinion of the committee in regard to (i), an opinion formed after the Legation had reported the strong objections to any attempt to restrain the flow of home-bound pilgrims. The agents of the Mogul Line in Jedda have expressed inability to adopt the suggestion at (ii), although they are willing to notify the proper authorities in Mecca and Medina of prospective sailings, and to answer enquiries by pilgrims. The suggestion at (iii) has been considered very carefully in Jedda, where His Majesty's Minister has been driven reluctantly to the conclusion that no arrangement to book passages at two different centres during a rush period could be made to work satisfactorily, having regard to various difficulties which he has stated in detail in a separate despatch to the Government of India. 144. In general, it may be said that all shipping arrangements worked satisfactorily this year, and it is unnecessary to revert to matters such as those dealt with in paragraphs 164, 166 and 168 of last year s report. Under an agreement reached between the Government of India and Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co., the arrangements foreshadowed in paragraph 169 of that report were brought into force in 1933. The company undertook as an experimental measure for one year to arrange for the landing and re-embarkation of pilgrims' luggage at an inclusive charge of 3 mpees per head, payable as an addition to passage money and to provide the necessary labour for handling it on board ship. The arrangement worked well and helped to reduce delay on the quay It is hoped that it will be renewed, although at least one violent protest has been made against it in India, viz., by Ismail Ghuznavi, writing m a Lahore paper on the 4th June. , „ , , , x . . • , 145 Cases again arose (see paragraph 167 of last year s report) m which pikrrims who had run short of funds and hoped to recover m Jedda deposits made in India in respect of possible quarantine dues m Iraq, had to have recourse to the generosity of fellow pilgrims to help them out 146 The Indian Section of the Legation issued 613 emergency passes to pilgrims without other papers, in accordance with the arrangements mentioned in paragraph 171 of last year s report. V:- : 'i | : 1 ;i: ■ ^ V 1 f30 Representations hy Pilgrims, &amp;c. 147. No representations of general interest in connexion with shipping arrangements, &amp;c., were made to the Legation this year. An Amir-Al-Haj was appointed in accordance with a recommendation made by the Haj Enquiry Committee in 1930. This gentleman, Mr. Hasan All P. Ibrahim, vice-president of the Bombay Haj Committee, travelled in the steamship Rizwani, and forwarded to the president of that committee, through the Legation, a valuable report, which dealt with a certain number of general matters as well as the incidents of the voyage. No exception need be taken to this in a first report of the kind, but it would perhaps cause confusion, if it became the practice to extend the scope of the reports in such a manner, when the system of having an Amir-Al-Haj or Pilgrims' Committee in every ship is brought into general application. 148. Strong representations were made to the Legation by pilgrims who arrived in Jedda on the steamship Akhar on the 16th March regarding an alleged case of misconduct between the senior doctor on board, a Parsee, and a consenting woman pilgrim. The case caused great agitation, which was allayed until the ship's arrival by the tact of the master and the good sense of certain leading pilgrims. It was considered advisable to arrange to relieve the doctor of his duties on the return voyage. This was made possible by transferring a doctor from another ship and replacing him by a volunteer, who had been in charge of the Afghan dispensary and was returning to India. 149. Arising out of paragraph 174 of the last report the Legation has forwarded to the Government of India at their request suggestions by Dr. Abdul Hamid regarding medical arrangements, &amp;c.. on board pilgrim ships. They deal with the questions of women doctors, latrines, dispensary and hospital accommodation and equipment and supplies of medicines. Registration, Return Ticket and Deposit System. 150. The Legation arrangements continued to work satisfactorily and 6,407 of the 6,697 Indian pilgrims shown in paragraph 126 as having arrived by sea registered at the Legation, the small deficit being accounted for as described in paragraph 177 of last year's report. 151. Twenty-three unclaimed or unused return halves of tickets dating from 1931 were forwarded to the Commissioner of Police, Bombay. 152. Four persons who had not deposited their return tickets at the Legation lost them. Arrangements similar to those described in paragraph 179 of last year's report were made to enable them to obtain passages. 153. The Indian vice-consul draws attention to a problem of which there were a few examples this year. Cases have arisen in which persons or associations in India purchase return tickets for servants or pilgrims to whom it is desired to give charitable assistance and later seek to establish a claim to refunds of the value of the return half, if the beneficiaries do not return to India. It is held in the Legation that only the holder of the ticket can be considered entitled to refund. 154. The Indian vice-consul again appeals for the collaboration of authorities in India in ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the information necessary to make the register kept in Jedda itself accurate and complete. The Government of India have already taken action to generalise the use of the indication letters suggested in paragraph 18 of section 9 of the report for 1929 and to request the shipping company to copy the pass numbers on to tickets in ink rather than in pencil. If these rules are observed and scrupulous care taken in making the general lists of pilgrims accurate, e.g., as to whether the pilgrims shown are holders of single or return tickets and to provide complete information regarding addresses, all will be well. 155. The arrangements for the Hyderabad Pilgrimage were in some respects unsatisfactory in 1932 (see paragraph 180 of last year's report). They were greatly improved this year, and the pilgrims from that State were excellently handled under the direction of a single ' Kafila Salar,' a competent person of high standing. 156. In the correspondence mentioned in paragraph 124 the Government of India stated that Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co. had instructed the commanders of their ships not to land stowaways at Jedda, as suggested in Recommendation No. 45 of the Haj Enquiry Committee (cf. paragraph 185 of31 299 iatii Iti I I I ■ ^ I leTetluii tra^ skll i slips, f aiii In liljill arrirdj 3r as k etditi tictel patafflf: es. last ^eai s report). The Saudi Government themselves showed an inclination this year to discourage stowaways by imprisoning two persons who o^ot ashore from the steamship Rizwam on the 30th March, notwithstanding the company's instructions, vv hen the fact came to the knowledge of the Indian vice-consul on the 29th April, one of the men had failed to make the pilgrimage, while the other had made it under police escort. They were released in consequence of a private appeal by the vice-consul, whose feelings were touched. His Majesty's Minister considers that they had been punished sufficiently, but does not consider that the Saudi Government can be criticised for dealing severely with persons who make themselves a nuisance to everybody. He has no doubt that stowaways should be discouraged by all means, and that it is far better that, whenever possible, they should not be allowed to land. Local Haj Committee. 157. This committee, which must not be confused with the official Saudi Committee mentioned in paragraph 108 {a), was constituted as usual for the purpose of regulating return passages to India. It was feared that its rather precarious existence might be affected by the death of the old Governor of Jedda, who was also the head of the most important local firm of shipping agents. The new Amir, a Nejdi official, was, however, helpful and the committee, sitting at the house of the Indian vice-consul, did useful work. destitutes. 158. Although the total number of Indian pilgrims was smaller in 1933 than in 1932, the number of persons who had to be repatriated at the expense of the Government of India was larger. The figures for the last few years have been 387 in 1930, 318 in 1931, 258 in 1932 and 299 up to the end of June 1933, with a possibility of more to follow. The following tables give an analysis of the figure just given for this year by {a) provinces of origin and (h) routes of access to the Hejaz :— (a) Province of origin- (1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 (7 (8 (9 (10 (11 (12 Punjab Bengal Sind ...

The authorities in India were able to get a quotation of 40 rupees per head direct from Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co. for the repatriation of destitutes. A sum of 80 rupees was collected from two persons who seemed able to contribute to the cost of their return. 1 he actual amount expended on behalf of the Government of India was 11,880 rupees, £24 gold and 11^ Saudi riyals. 160. The usual precautions were taken to guard against fraud, to provide the authorities in India with lists of the persons repatriated and to take from each an undertaking to repay the money expended. 'M I ^ 160 a . The problem of the destitute Indian pilgrims has been fully dealt with in previous reports. Table (b) in paragraph 158 above shows that it is still very largely a question of persons who reach the Mejaz oveiland. The Govern ment of India are still considering by what means this traffic can be brought under control. The matter is undoubtedly very thorny, as so many of the persons came by land from remote parts of Arabia, the access to which from India may be difficult to regulate. It is nevertheless desirable that the problem should be tackled, lest the development of motor transport {cf. paragraph 86) should increase its dimensions. 160 b . In so far as the problem relates to pilgrims who originally came to the Hejaz by sea, but for one reason or another have not the means of returning, good results may be expected from two sets of measures adopted by the Govern ment of India, viz., (a) measures to restrict severely the issue of single tickets at the ports of embarkation, both by administrative action and by including in the Bill to amend the Merchant Shipping Act a clause doing away with the former provision enabling pilgrims to take single tickets on making a sworn declaration of not intending to return to India within three years; and {b) measures to check more strictly clauses by departing pilgrims to be regarded as foreign; especially Saudi nationals, and to impress on those travelling as foreigners the fact that they cannot later look for assistance as being British nationals in the Hejaz. The Government of India have been obliged to discard, owing to opposition or ^ anticipated opposition in India, two suggestions made in previous reports, viz., | te i e , that the validity of return tickets should be prolonged and discretion given to the Legation to allow or disallow refunds at any time during the period of validity, and that return tickets should be made compulsory all the year round (see paragraph 184 of last year's report, which adverts to all these points). 161. The whole subject of refunds on return tickets, which is so important an element in the problem just discussed, forms the subject of a separate despatch to the Government of India. A particular aspect of it, not primarily connected with the problem of destitutes, is mentioned in paragraph 153 above. mplc le staff ipilgi us and t isp mg es( Esin the tiiep Publicity. 162. A second edition of the Guide for Pilgrims to the Hejaz was issued by ^nms the Government of India on the 20th December, 1932, and published early this ; junil: r I ^ V-v 11 ^4- ^-»-v 4 -• -Pz-x-Mfv* r* 4--i/^v-P 4-4-/-vo4- 11 4' I 1 'I 17' T^l 1 (TT 1 ! TT1S. 1^)9. year. This booklet contains information of the greatest utility to pilgrims including much information about pilgrimage conditions in the Hejaz, the medical and other facilities provided there by the Government of India and precautions which should be observed by pilgrims in their own interest. The second edition gave also the Legation's tentative estimate of expenditure likely to be incurred by Indian pilgrims in 1933. Notwithstanding what was said in paragraph 190 of last year's report, the inclusion of this feature is valuable provided that it be intended to reissue the guide each year and that official information regarding the prospective cost of the next following pilgrimage is available in time. It is not anticipated that there will be any great change in the Saudi official tariff for 1934, but it has not been issued up to the time of writing (July 1933). It would therefore be unsafe to reprint last year's estimate in the guide or otherwise pending the receipt of further information from the Legation, which will forward it to the Government of India when available. 163. The signboards for the offices, &amp;c., served by the Indian and medical sections of the Legation have been supplied from India in accordance with the suggestion mentioned in paragraph 192 of last year's report, but were not received in time to be brought into use during the 1933 pilgrimage. Banking Facilities. 164. There has been no change in the position described in previous reports. Reference is made in paragraph 7 {a) to the concession granted to a group heaae t wrs ( liiceo U Nth Wfb df N 'larcl •fHacei lc e ir eacl Ulsko33 m%\ ii nsofrttc single fe incluiiJ E|| by the ex-Khedive of Egypt for the creation of a State Bank, but the bank has not matei laiisea up to the time of writing, and the prospects of the scheme must be regarded uncertain. The principal banking concerns in Jedda are still the Netherlands irading Society, which has branches in India, and Messrs. Gellatly Hankey and Co., whose correspondents there are the National Bank of India. The Legation again deprecates the use of Hundis. 165. Leading Indian pilgrims have renewed the suggestion (see para graph 153 of the report for 1931) that the Legation should be equipped to cash drafts and to make payments at Mecca and Medina. His Majesty's Minister considers it undesirable that the Legation should engage in this class of business, even if it had adequate staff and could make arrangements in the interior. Arrangements already exist whereby pilgrims wishing to leave surplus cash in safe custody can deposit it at the Legation. The amount so deposited this year was 39,665 rupees. Indian Staff. 166. The stalf of the Indian section, consisting of the Indian vice-consul and two permanent clerks, was reinforced as usual during the pilgrimage season by the employment of three temporary clerks and two messengers. All members i ;. of the staff worked efficiently and industriously. In view of the fact that the •'J,' Indian pilgrimage has not diminished in anything like the same proportion as mm.] rei irs Isinil tlODglil iriodoft' others and that the work of the section tends to increase, as the pilgrimage is better organised, it is much to be hoped that the Government of India will sanction the re-employment of a third permanent clerk as soon as financial conditions permit. This could make it possible to dispense with one temporary clerk during the season, so long as the pilgrimage remains on the present scale. A middle solution would be to employ locally all the year round for, say, two years in the first instance, Munshi Qazi Fazlullah, who has been employed for some time past as a temporary clerk, and is highly thought of by Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah. The employment of three permanent clerks would inter alia facilitate leave arrangements. 167. As regards the medical section, see paragraph 58 above. IS 801 , of a ii (11) A fghan Pilgrimage. 168. The revival of the Afghan pilgrimage has been one of the more remarkable features of a period of lean years. The figures since 1927-28, the peak years of the pilgrimage generally since Ibn Saud conquered the Hejaz, have been: 3,858 in 1927, 3,022 in 1928, 1,705 in 1929, 1,218 in 1930, 973 in 1931, 1,751 in 1932 and 2,412 in 1933, a figure not far short of 12 per cent, of the total of pilgrims from overseas. Attention has been called earlier to the presence of a fair number of highly-placed Afghan personages this year. 169. The majority of Afghan pilgrims again travelled from India on ; return tickets or deposit-paid passes. About twenty Afghan destitutes came to tlie .? the notice of the Legation, which could not assist them any more than the Afghan consular clerk mentioned below. They were repatriated by local charity. 170. The conclusion of a Saudi Afghan treaty and the provision by the Afghan Government of certain facilities for Afghan pilgrims in Mecca were dealt with in the corresponding section of last year's report. Although the treaty has not been ratified, the Afghan Government made a further move this year by detaching their consul at Bombay for service in Mecca during the pilgrimage season. This gentleman, Silah Uddin Khan Seljuqi, was duly appointed Afghan consul in Jedda. His stay lasted, however, only from the 16th March to the 26th April. He did not take a house or establish a permanent office, but he left an experienced clerk in charge of his work. 171. Both parties in Afghanistan appear to attach importance to the Holy Places of the Hejaz as a centre where propaganda can be carried on, whence influence may radiate backward to Afghanistan, and where perhaps they can watch each other's activities. The Indian vice-consul reports that Afghan mullahs hold periodical meetings, and engage thereat m considerable pro-Nadir propaganda in their own language in the precincts of the Haram at Mecca. The visit of an important member of ex-King Amanullah s entourage is recorded in paragraph 22 above. [9002] F34 (12) Malay Pilgrimage. 172. The following paragraphs are adapted in part from the special report by the Malay pilgrimage officer, Haji Abdul Majid, a copy of which he is under stood to have submitted to the Government of the Straits Settlements direct. Shipping {outward from Malay Ports). 173. The steamship Automedon of the Blue Funnel Line, with 139 pilgrims on board, left Singapore on the 13th November and arrived at Jedda on the 30th November, 1932, thus inaugurating, as far as Malaya is concerned, the pilgrimage season under review. She was followed by two vessels of the same line, carrying a total of 513 pilgrims. This number, which agrees almost exactly with that given in the general statistics in paragraph 31 above, included, as usual, pilgrims of Dutch, Siamese, Chinese, American, Hejazi, and other nationalities, in addition to British Malays. Number of Pilgrims. 174. Out of this total of 513, only 101 were from British Malaya. Their distribution by places of origin was as follows :— Straits Settlements— Singapore Penang and Province Wellesley Malacca Labuan Federated Malay States— Perak ... Selangor Negri Sembilan ... Pahang Unfederated Malay States— Johore ... Kedah ... Perlis ...

Although the above total shows an increase on the total of 80 for last year, it again reflects the effect of economic depression on the flow of pilgrims from Malaya, who were formerly so numerous. Feeding on Board, Ships. 176. There appeared to be an improvement this year in the preparation of food on board the pilgrim ships. Haji Abdul Majid records that pilgrims state they would be glad of more variety in the salt-fish supplied to them, as one quality only is supplied at present. It is hoped that those responsible for the catering on board the ships will endeavour to effect further improvements next year. Sheikhs' or Mutaivwifs' Charges. 177. The general nature and effects of the Saudi pilgrimage tariff are again fully discussed in a separate section of this report. The Malay pilgrimage officer states that the approximate rate of exchange this year was 20 riyals = £1 gold = 13 Straits dollars on the average. 178. Haji Abdul Majid had not prepared, before leaving Jedda, an inclusive estimate of the expenditure incurred by Malay pilgrims this year. He will doubtless furnish this to the authorities in Malaya'in order to facilitate the preparation there, on receipt of the Saudi tariff, of an estmate for 1934. This Hf have iateso^ 'mi p i, ; st-of-kin icase,!) fca, 0 mog orir Nor %iedr 35 Q bubtc H Couditions duviifig the PilgTimcige Season. ^£2 f^chil Majid confirms the opinion expressed earlier that the price of lood-stuns and water was no greater this year than in 1932; perhaps, if anything, rather lower. 180. Malay pilgrims have not, as yet, availed themselves of the facilities and accommodation afforded by the hotels established by the Saudi Arab Government m Mecca, Medina and Jedda for the convenience of pilgrims of the richer class (see paragraph 12 {a) above). Assistance to Pilgrims. 181. The prevalent distress due to hard times again led to an increase, under this head, of repatriation of destitute pilgrims. It was decided this year to make a clearance of a number of hard cases, including some of a kind not usually repatriated. The Government of the Straits Settlements sanctioned an expenditure of £320, of which a total of £279 Is. Id. was expended on the repatriation of forty individuals. These persons in each case gave signed undertakings to refund the amounts expended on them. 182. The work of disposing of these distressed and destitute pilgrims was greatly facilitated by the Blue Funnel Line, who were good enough to reduce the fare for destitutes, up to a limit of fifty, from 90 Straits dollars to £6 sterling. Conditions governing the Issue of Steamshiy Tickets and Refunds. 183. The ' Guiding Rules,' to which a reference was made in paragraph 213 of last year's report, have been followed this year. They were amended in October in respect of refunds to the next-of-kin of a deceased ticket- holder. Illicit Sale of Return Halves of Steamship Tickets. 184. The adoption of the ' Guiding Rules ' suggested the advisability of dealing with another matter, namely, that of improving the precautions against the sale by Malay pilgrims of the return halves of their tickets. It is hoped that the greater liberality of the new ' Guiding Rules ' as regards the period of validity and conditions applying to refunds on unused tickets will of itself diminish the temptation to withdraw return tickets with a view to improper sale, but this does not constitute a complete safeguard. Correspondence is still proceeding between the Legation and the Government of the Straits Settlements as to the best means of minimising the risk of illicit transactions. Mortality. 185. The number of deaths this year is given as 1, up to the 12th May r 1933. This gives a death rate of 1 per cent., whereas last year it was 2^ per cent. In view of the smallness of the Malayan pilgrimage in 1932 and 1933, these figures have little independent value, but they correspond satisfactorily with the estimates of general mortality in paragraph 53 above. Deceased Pilgrims' Effects. 186. Three enquiries regarding the effects of deceased pilgrims by their next-of-kin in Malaya were referred to the Saudi Government, whose reply, in each case, had not been received when the Malay pilgrimage officer left Jedda for Malaya. Other enquiries were successfully dealt with. Pilgrimage Officer's Audience with the King. 187. The audience accorded by the King to Haji Abdul Majid (see paragraph 17) afforded the latter an opportunity of submitting to His Majesty, in the form of a private memorandum, his views regarding the establishment of hostels for Malay students in Mecca. He characterised the present position as unsatisfactory, and, in advocating the creation of hostels, conducted under Government supervision and control, expressed the opinion that they could be maintained by contributions by the parents of students and by 'auqaf,' or charitable donations. 188. During the audience the Malay pilgrimage officer put forward a suggestion, also embodied in his memorandum, for the improvement in the system of selecting and appointing sheikhs or mutawwifs, representing that only men of the best type should be chosen in view of their functions not merely as cicerones but also as spiritual guides. [9002] f 2Malay Floating Population in the Hejaz. 189. A rough census of Malays in this country at the time of this year's pilgrimage was attempted by the Malay pilgrimage clerk. According to his estimate, there were about 500 British Malays in Mecca, survivals from earlier seasons, over and above the 101 who arrived this year. It is supposed that about 200 of the total were pilgrims who had received back from the Malay pilgrimage office here the return portions of their steamship tickets as if they were to return to Malaya, but who had sold the tickets to others and had themselves returned to Mecca to remain on in this country. Malay Pilgrimage Staff. 190. Haji Abdul Majid, the Malay pilgrimage officer, arrived at Jedda on the 1st January, 1933. Haji Muhammad Jamil acted for him from the 1st December, 1932, until his arrival, and continued to assist him until the 16th January, 1933. Owing to pressure of work, due to the new system of control to prevent the sale of return tickets, Haji Muhammad Jamil had to be re -engaged from the 12th April to the 12th May, 1933. (13) West African Pilgrimage. 191. The Saudi returns (see paragraph 31) show 509 West African pilgrims of all nationalities as having entered the port of Jedda on pilgrimage this year, as compared with 780 last year. There is reason to believe that the hgure of 509 is made up exclusively of British and French West Africans and that about 75 per cent, of these were British or British-protected. As in previous years, a large number of West African pilgrims, computed this year at something less than 2,000, entered the smaller Hejazi and Asiri ports south of Jedda from Massawa by dhow. 192. After a further exchange of correspondence at the beginning of 1933 between the Government of Nigeria, the Sudan Government and this Legation, it was decided to bring into force without further delay the Nigerian pilgrimage scheme mentioned in paragraph 219 of last year's report. Although the scheme will take some time to produce its full effect, it is hoped that it will eventually provide means to control the West African pilgrimage more effectively, if only the flow of pilgrims by dhow from Massawa to Asiri and other ports south of Jedda can be averted. The position in this respect remains substantially the same as recorded in last year's report (see paragraphs 220 and 221 thereof). There is ample evidence to show that the traffic has been in full swing again this year, and that the estimate given above of nearly 2,000 pilgrims carried by dhow from Massawa is not far off the mark. An attempt was made last autumn to interest the new Italian Minister in this subject, and he was given privately, at his own request, a memorandum for use during a visit he was about to pay to Asmara. M. de Peppo appeared impressed with the necessity for reform, but on his return he merely said that he had done his best and avoided further discussion. 193. The situation is thrown into relief by a comparison of the figures appearing in the Alexandria International Quarantine Board's report on the pilgrimage of 1932 with statistics, locally obtained, of the arrivals of pilgrims by steamer from Massawa. On p. 61 of the board's report it is stated, on the strength of information supplied by the Government of Eritrea themselves, that 2,405 pilgrims were embarked at Massawa for the Hejaz from the 1st January, 1932, onwards. On the other hand, according to figures furnished by the Jedda agents of the small Italian steamers trading in the Red Sea—the only steamers plying direct between Massawa and this port—an aggregate of 203 pilgrims only was carried, on eight voyages, during the period the 1st January to the 30th April, 1932. It has been suggested that these facts might usefully be ventilated at the next meeting of the International Health Office. Considerable pressure will undoubtedly have to be brought to bear upon the Italian authorities before any move is made by them to dislodge the powerful vested interests in Eritrea involved in this traffic. 194. The Emir of Katsina, who made the pilgrimage this year with members of his family and numerous retainers, arrived in Jedda on the 15th March, eight days before he was due. He first proceeded to Medina and J T oi Ant W( Jriisof !) 1^ yei ilis, bu ii S od fell Sor indi lied at J 1 i. i its in A art! . ar's rated tl Image we recon ilanopf ® Lond 's that tl 'fell was fort) sho 'kose si k M j •Somali bribes 1 'all to ei fmsai %1{37 thence to Mecca, a place which he had previously visited some twelve years before. On his departure from this country he expressed his satisfaction at the considera tion shown to him by Ibn Saud. He left for Port Sudan en route for the United Kingdom on the 9th April. His attractive and rather striking personality assured him of popularity, but he knew how to combine charm with a canny skill in resisting the blandishments of local mendicants and touts. 195. Twelve West Africans were assisted on their onward journey to Suakin from the funds of the Nigerian Repatriation Fund. Much poverty continues to prevail among the British West African pilgrims temporarily resident in this country owing to the depressed labour market, and, although measures were successfully taken this year to discourage hopes of any mass repatriation, it is anticipated that a large number will have to be repatriated next year. 196. Repatriation of West Africans : position on the 24th July, 1933 : — {a) Applications considered deserving of examination : 250. (h) Applicants repatriated : None repatriated, but twelve assisted. (c) Applications still under reference : None. (14) Somali Pilgrimage. 197. According to the Saudi figures (see paragraph 31), seventy-five Somali pilgrims of all nationalities entered the port of Jedda this year as compared with 115 last year. It is not possible to estimate how many of these were British Somalis, but there is reason to believe that they did not exceed fifteen from British Somaliland, and probably a lesser number from Aden. The number of British Somalis who reached Mecca overland from Aden, Hodeyda, Qunfida, Jizan and other southern ports may, perhaps, be put at twice the number who landed at Jedda, but there are no means of confirming this estimate. 198. The Government of British Somaliland, like the other British Cjovern- ments in Africa, except that of Nigeria and the Sudan Government, introduced this year the new tvpe of pilgrim pass mentioned in paragraphs 28 and 224 oi last year's report. Those Somalis who took out this new pilgiim pass also deposited the sum of 50 rupees with the issuing officer. In three cases advances were made by the Legation against the sums deposited. 199. The question of the disposal of Somali destitutes applying tor repatriation at the end of the pilgrimage season, neaihy all of whom come on pilsrimasre overland, and certain other matters m regard to Somali pilgrims, which had been the subject of earlier correspondence, were discussed m London in November 1932 between the Chief Commissioner of the Somahland Protectorate and His Majesty's Minister in Jedda. The results of the discussion were recorded in a subsequent exchange of letters, after Sn Andiew R\an had had an opportunity of consulting Captain B. W. Seager, who was compelled to leave London a few days before the meeting. The prmc^al agreementre^ was that the system of repatriating destitute bomalis from Jedda by s ^ ms P which was adopted experimentally last year (see paragraph 227 of the 193^ report) should be abandoned on grounds of expense, and that, except m case of those suffering from serious illness, persons repauiated should be sent by dhow. Major Lawrance pointed out that the moneys disbursed by the Lega ion on Somali destitutes are recovered not from the individuals themselves, but tL tXs to Which they belong, and that it is more important to study economy than to ensure the arrival of the individuals assisted at a destination in SomalilaiK^ep^t^ation of British Somalis : position on the 24th July, 1933 (a)Applications considered deserving of examination : 45. lb) Applicants repatriated : 29. (c) Applications still under reference : Mil. (15) Sudanese 9m Arrordine to the Saudi returns (see paragraph 31), 420 Sudanese pilgrims arrived thifyear in Khedivial Mail Line ships from Suakin. as compared with 527 last year.Ut 202. At the beginning of the incoming season it was reported that a number of Sudanese pilgrims were arriving with insufficient funds to pay for their pilgrimage expenses, and it was anticipated that in the return season there would be numerous applications for assistance. This prognostication proved to be well-founded. Within eleven days of the return of the first pilgrims to Jedda from Mecca, forty-three Sudanese pilgrims were advanced a total of £E .82|. This was required for the payment of mutawwif's dues, for subsistence and for the repayment of small loans contracted on pilgrimage. Since the 21st April and up to the time of writing (July 1933) a further nineteen persons have had to be assisted, making a total to date of sixty two Sudanese pilgrims who were unable to leave this country without financial assistance. Six Sudanese pilgrims, who were not in possession of Suakin pilgrim passes, applied for repatriation this year. 203. A number of pilgrims from the Sudan did harm to their own interests by informing their prospective pilgrim guides on arrival that they were natives of Khartum, Omdurman, El Obeid, Atbara, Wadi Haifa, &amp;c., whereas, in fact, they were natives of small villages whose respective merkez and mudiriyehs were the towns mentioned. The danger of such statements lies in the fact that under the Saudi pilgrimage tariff inhabitants of towns, such as those named above, are subject to a fixed mutawwif's fee of 187 piastres miri gold, whereas inhabitants of the smaller villages and outlying districts £ ' owing to their poverty pay such gratuity to their mutawwifs as they wish.' The usual rule is that the Saudi passport authorities register the villages of origin of the various Sudanese pilgrims in accordance with the particulars given on their Suakin pilgrim passes, but if a pilgrim should himself volunteer the statement that he comes from a town, while he is actually from a remote village specified in his pilgrim pass, the authorities are only too prone to accept his statement as correct. 204. It is suggested that the port authorities in the Sudan should (a) instruct officers issuing pilgrim passes to be careful in all cases to specify the pilgrim's actual village of birth or residence on his Suakin pilgrim pass, and (b) cause pilgrims to be expressly warned that they should, when questioned on arrival in Jedda as to their place of origin, name only the locality shown in their passes. 205. There was the usual shortage of shipping facilities this year owing to the limited number of ships at the disposal of the Khedivial Mail Line, but no pilgrims had to wait longer in Jedda than a maximum of ten days. 206. Repatriation of Sudanese : Position on 24th July, 1933 (a) Applications considered deserving of examination : 6. (b) Applicants repatriated : 2. (c) Applications still under reference : 4. (16) Zanzibari and East African Pilgrimage. 207. The Saudi returns (see paragraph 31) show under the head of Zanzibari and East African pilgrims only one person as having landed this year at Jedda as against 102 last year. This must be dismissed as a definite inaccuracy, as at least twelve East Africans visited the Legation on their return journey from Mecca. A few of them were in possession of the new form of pilgrim pass mentioned in paragraphs 28 and 224 of last year's report. 208. The heirs of Ahmed Rajab, the pilgrim from Zanzibar, whose death was recorded in paragraph 235 of last year's report, were ultimately located in the Hadhramaut, and in due course appointed a person, who was making the pilgrimage this year, to act as their attorney (wakil) in connexion with the proceedings against the Indian chauffeur who caused the death of the deceased. Ihe law requires the participation of legal representatives in all such cases, as ^ the question of blood-money arises. In this case the wakil appointed was baffled lij by the working of the local judicial machinery. He had no funds and there was no prospect of any expenditure being covered by an effective recovery of blood- money, if awarded. He abandoned the case after some weeks and the Legation has now transferred its interest to the accused, also a British subject, with a view to securing the early termination of the proceedings against him and of his protracted imprisonment. ^09. No Zanzibari and East African pilgrim applied for repatriation this year.■ i C'| | mieii; is f ttttkeiipj rule is ti iriousSii pilgrift J comes ii mi s istospi gnu pasi'i i quesl ■sloiii lil Lke,k adof^ earatJi jyfroil ■as P kL ixioii ^ Slid ^ ted# i^erj ^ 39 (17) South African Pilgrimage. . , . 210 - .^ c 9 ordin g to the Saudi returns in paragraph 31, thirty-seven South African pilgrims entered this country on pilgrimage this year as compared with sixty-two last \ear.

A doubt has been suggested as to whether these ships conform to the provisions of the International Sanitary Con\ention of 1926, where they are not excepted pro tanto under article 96. In the absence of complaint by the British authorities concerned in the countries of destination, His Majesty's Minister doubts whether this question is sufficiently important to be pursued, especially as the Saudi Government are not ratifying parties to the convention. (18) Palestinian and Transjordanian Pilgrimage. 212. According to the figures of the Palestine Government only 252 Palestinian and Transjordanian citizens were registered this year as intending pilgrims, as compared with 1,290 last year. The Saudi returns in paragraph 31 put the number of Palestinians and Transjordanians who entered this country through the ports of Jedda and Yanbu this year at 240, a number which agrees fairly closely with the number of applications in the countries of origin. As usual the greater number of these pilgrims travelled by train to Suez from Kantara, and thence arrived in Saudi Arabia on steamers of the Khedivial Mail Line. 213. During the return season there were naturally fewer applications than last year for a refund in Jedda of the sums deposited in Palestine. In all, ninety-six pilgrims, or 40 per cent, of the total pilgrimage, were each advanced the sum of £E.4. 214. The Government of Palestine, following the suggestion made by His Majesty's Minister last year (see paragraph 240 of last year's report), were good enough this year to second Fuad Efendi Onbar ji, a Moslem clerk in the employ of the Palestine Health Office, for service with this Legation for a period of two months. He arrived in Jedda on the 9th April, and although the work connected with the Palestinian pilgrimage was lighter than in 1932, he was of the greatest use in assisting Captain Seager to deal with it without prejudice to his other duties. It was possible to release him for return to Palestine.on the 1st May, as the pilgrimage proper had terminated by that date. The question whether similar assistance should be asked for next year will be considered in the light of the information available nearer the time -as to the prospective number of Palestinian and Transjordanian pilgrims in 1934. 215. Considerable difficulty was experienced at the Legation in May and June in dealing with over thirty pilgrims who had arrived overland, and who sought assistance as destitutes of alleged Palestinian or Transjordanian nationality, although most of them were without identity papers. As the summer season approaches, it is difficult to adopt the logical course of simply telling such persons, already enfeebled by their earlier efforts, to walk back. General sanction was received from Jerusalem last year within a short period of submission being made for the repatriation of a number of pilgrims in similar cases, whose claim to Palestinian or Transjordanian nationality appeared to be prima facie valid. It was anticipated that similar authority would be given this year, but the authorities in Palestine found it necessary to investigate each individual case closely. Ihe enquiries were in some cases protracted, and m a number of cases the Legation found it necessary to allow small doles to the destitutes. This made it all the more necessary to keep track of them in order that the monev advanced should be recovered fiom them, together with any sum expended on their repatriation, in due course. The pilgrims became truculent and at times riotous, pestering Doth the Legation and the local authoiities. The position at the time of writing is that eighteen have been repatriated piece-meal on individual sanctions from Jerusalem, a small number have vanished, and one still awaits disposal. The question arises whethei it would not be bettei infuture to issue a general warning in the two countries of origin that pilgrims proceeding to the Hejaz overland without adequate funds will in no case be assisted by the British authorities in Jedda, and to enfoice this strictly save in the most exceptional cases. His Majesty s Ministei proposes to discuss the matter during his visit to Jerusalem at the end of July. ^ . . 216. Repatriation of Palestinians and Transjordanians .

(19) A denese Pilgrimage. 217. According to the Saudi returns in paragraph 31, seventeen Adenese and natives of the Aden Protectorate reached Jedda for the 1933 pilgi image, as compared with ninety-seven last year. A larger number came oveiland, but no information is available regarding them. 218. The attention of the Government of Aden is being drawn m a separate despatch to an unfortunate imbroglio caused by the failure of the Besse Line, a small concern which has its headquarters there, and runs two small \essels very irregularly in the Red Sea, to provide a ship until the 29th April for the return voyage of a mixed lot of pilgrims to whom return tickets had been issued. About 150 pilgrims of various origins in South-W^est Arabia and Africa were held up in Jedda, where they paraded the streets and bombarded the Legation with complaints. Bv the time a ship arrived the Yemeni elements were out of hand. The agents of the Besse Line pleaded force majeure, but all possible steps should be taken to prevent a recurrence of the incident. 219. A number of applications for repatriation have been received from Adenese and natives of the Aden Protectorate, most of whom came on pilgrimage overland this year. Except in one case, all such applications have been referred to Aden in the first instance. 220. Repatriation of Adenese : Position on the 24th July, 1933 ;— (a) Applications considered deserving of examination : 28. (h) Applicants repatriated : 10. {c) Applications still under reference : 7. (20) Hadhrami Pilgrimage. 221. According to the Saudi returns in paragraph 31 above, 273 Hadhramis came on pilgrimage this year by sea, as compared with 465 last year. Most of these embarked as usual at Aden and at Mokalla in ships of the Besse Line, while an unknown number walked to Mecca overland via Aden, Yemen and Asir. 222. Economic depression continues to affect Hadhramis of the semi-settled class mentioned in paragraph 243 of last year's report. Many of them have been leaving the country for good. Others are selling up their businesses and are returning to the Hadhramaut, where they state they intend to remain until a more prosperous era sets in. Captain Seager estimates that in the past three years over 500 Hadhramis in both the above categories have left this country. A few of them, as is their wont, have left for the Dutch East Indies, Malaya, India, &amp;c., in the hope of finding better prospects there. 223. During the return season over 400 Hadhramis applied to the Legation for travel papers to enable them to return home. The number would have been larger but for financial difficulties. Some have not the means to leave, whilst others are owed considerable sums of money which they cannot recover. 224. Repatriation of Hadhramis : Position on the 24th July, 1933 {a) Applications considered deserving of examination : 25. {h) Applicants repatriated : None, but 10 assisted. {c) Applications still under reference : None.41 (21) The Muscati Pilgrimaqe. thirtv^x itT932 1 cfm t e 0 o l n h nit aUdi 1 ' et t Y nS ' eleVen Muscatis . as compared with thirty six m icame on pilgrimage this year, arriving at Jedda bv sea It is ft'is impossible to^stimatlf their rranAer 6 ^ fl ' 0m MUSCat and 0nian OTerland - but 2 k 6 -' ? n ] e ^ scatl pilgrim applied for repatriation this year.

The heavier dues and fees of Javanese pilgrims are due to the fact that the mutawwif's gratuity includes board at Mecca, Arafat and Mina, house rent at Mecca and Mina, tent hire at Arafat and cost of firewood, water, lighting and servants' wages. The heavier transport charges are due to the fact that the transport of their luggage requires more camels than that of other pilgrims. 2. The heavier expenses of Indian and Bengali pilgrims are on account of house rent at Mecca and tent hire at Arafat and Mina, but they have the option of either paying these or of arranging for themselves. 3. The lighter fees and dues of Malabari, Sindhi and Afghan pilgrims are on account of the smaller gratuity payable by them, owing to the small expense which their mutawwifs bear in addition to the arrangements which they themselves make for renting houses and hiring tents. 4. The case of pilgrims who pay such gratuity as they wish (see item 30) is of the same nature. 5. In case it be necessary to disembark pilgrims at the Quarantine Island, a sum of 9^ piastres miri should be taken from each passenger as boat hire for a period of three days, and If piastres for each day over three days. Motor Transport Charges. The following are the charges per passenger :— By Car By Bus (4 or 6 seater). (13-1 o seater). £ Gold. £ Gold. 1^ 1 From Jedda to Mecca. 1^ 1 From Mecca to Jedda. 15 10 From Mecca to Medina and return. 15 10 From Jedda to Medina and return. 16 11 From Yanbu to Medina and on to Mecca. 8 5^ From Yanbu to Medina, single. 8 5^ From Medina to Mecca, single. Remarks. 1. These charges are fixed for the whole season of 1351, from beginning to end, without any increase or decrease either at the beginning or end of the said season. 2. The reason for the increase observed between the charges for Yanbu and for Mecca is that cars which carry pilgrims from Yanbu return empty from Jedda to Yanbu, which costs the companies additional expense. [9002]44 Explanations. First. —The Javanese pilgrim who wishes to come on pilgrimage on the basis of paying all expenses and charges in a lump sum should pay to the mutawwif the sum of £18 gold in respect of all the dues, fees and transport charges which will be required from the time of his landing at Jedda quay till his return to the quay. Boat hire is additional. This sum will cover travel by camel, but if pilgrims wish to travel by car, the hire of the car should be paid after deducting the hire of the camel. Secondly. —Any foreign coin will be accepted from pilgrims at the market rate on the day of payment, if they have no gold coin. Thirdly.—On pilgrims' arrival at Jedda and on demand of the mutawwif, they must pay to his wakil at Jedda the fixed dues and fees, with the exception of rents and transport charges, which will be paid as and when they become due, according to whether pilgrims wish to perform their visit to Medina from Jedda before they go to Mecca or after. To safeguard the rights of the pilgrim, the agent of the mutawwif must not pay these dues and fees to the mutawwif, but must send them to the sheikh of the mutawwifs at Mecca. The sheikh of the mutawwifs shall pay out of that amount the half of the sum due to the mutawwif and keep the other half in his possession till the departure of pilgrims. The sheikh of the mutawwifs shall pay to the mutawwif the other half due to him after the departure of the last batch of pilgrims belonging to that mutawwif, with a view to securing their comfort. Fourthly. —Fixed dues and fees once paid will not be refunded under any circumstances. Fifthly. —The difference between hire of camel and bus hire to Mecca and Medina is 506 piastres miri. The period of travel by car will not exceed three days and by camel twenty days. Sixthly. —Certain pilgrims prefer to remove the roof of the bus when wearing ihram; in such a case the pilgrim will have to pay half an English gold pound for this purpose. Seventhly. —The period fixed for passengers by motor transport to stay at Medina is eight days, excluding the two days of entering and leaving and (allowing for the fact) that they may leave Medina before the expiration of this period if they like, but if they wish to stay for a longer period they must pay to the owner of the car a fixed sum in respect of the extra days of stay as follows Piastres miri. From the ninth to the twentieth day ... ... 137-1 From the twenty-first to the thirtieth day ... ... 165 From the thirty-first to the fortieth day ... ... 220 Eighthly. —There is no difference in the charges for the visit to Medina, whether pilgrims proceed from Mecca to Medina, or from Jedda to Medina before they go to Mecca. Ninthly. —The dues, fees and charges fixed in this tariff for the year 1351 are not liable to decrease or increase, and the pilgrim is bound to pay them. If he is asked to pay more than the tariff, he should apply to the Government, so that they may refund to him what was taken from him and punish the person concerned severely. Tenthly. —The Government have made special arrangements for motor transport and have decided to appoint engineers and to establish stations on the road between Jedda, Mecca and Medina containing benzine and all spare parts which may be needed. They are taking steps to make certain places on the road where pilgrims may rest; such places will contain every means of comfort, such as food, refreshment and sleeping accommodation. The Government have also taken all necessary precautions with a view to avoiding the occurrence of trouble to pilgrims and in order to facilitate their journeys. These arrangements will be published later on in all languages and will be distributed free amongst pilgrims on their arrival at Jedda, Yanbu, Mecca and Medina. Eleventhly. —Moreover, the Government have prepared a special publication giving advice and instruction of which the pilgrim may be in need, so that he may be well aware of every matter which he may need to enquire about. This publication will be made in the shape of a pamphlet printed in all the languages of the Moslems and will be distributed free everywhere.Twelfthly. The Government have also appointed a Committee of Inspection to supervise the work of the mutawwifs and afford comfort to pilgrims The committee itself will supervise the places and houses occupied by pilgrims enquire about their comfort, hear their complaints and take necessary action for the avoidance 01 any inconveniences. TUTteentUy.—Th» Government will publish, for the information of Moslems, the prices of food-stufts and the rates of exchange of foreign coin in order to aliord to pilgrims every means of comfort which the Government consider one of their most important tasks. Fourteenthly.—The Government will also publish, for the information of pilgrims, a time-table showing the dates of departure of mails from the Hejaz for Islamic countries, so that they may be able to communicate in time with their homes and families. Fifteenthly. —The Government have made repairs to the motor road to Taif, so that pilgrims who may desire to go there will easilv cover the distance between Mecca and Taif in four hours by car.this document is THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT ♦ 1 x fa 11 2 EASTERN (A rabia). CONFIDENTIAL. [E 1633/73/25] i March 13, 1934. S ection 1. No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received March 13) {No. 50.) HIS Majesty's Minister at Jedda presents his compliments to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit to him copy of a note to the Government of India, dated the 20th February, 1934, respecting the Jedda water supply, Jedda, February 20, 1934. Enclosure in No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to the Government of India. Sir, Jedda, February 20, 1934. IN your despatch of the 25th January you were good enough to inform me of the action taken in India to bring to the notice of intending pilgrims the medical advice recommended for observance during their stay in the Hejaz by the Indian medical officer attached to this Legation. I have the honour to inform you that one of the questions dealt with by Dr. Abdul Hamid, that of drinking- water in Jedda, has recently reached a stage which makes it of special interest in this connexion. 2. Jedda has, previous to this year, been supplied with water from three main sources : {a) By the Government sea-water condenser; {b) by ' saharij,' or rain-water from reservoirs; (c) by well-water from wells close round Jedda. A series of attempts have recently been made to supplement these supplies by bringing into the town the water from wells at Waziriya, a place some 7 miles inland from which water was brought to the town in Turkish days. In August of last year the committee engaged in the work succeeded in making this water again reach the town through the old Turkish conduit. 3. The subject, although mentioned in the annual pilgrimage report and in Jedda monthly reports, has hitherto been considered more particularly from the economic point of view, and the principal recent despatch on it was Mr. Calvert's No. 355 of the 9th December to the Foreign Office, which was distributed to the Department of Overseas Trade only in addition. In that despatch Mr. Calvert stated that the prospects of a satisfactory flow of water appeared good, but that the committee was said to be lethargic and had to contend with the hostility of vested interests, notably that attributed to the powerful Minister of Finance, who looks to the sales of water from the present sea-watei condensers as a small but certain source of revenue. The position as regards the water actually arriving in Jedda from Waziriya was less satisfactory. They have, however,'' said Mr. Calvert, speaking of the committee, done nothing towards tliG rciiGWctl of tli6 conduit nGcir the town, cind it has now be6n established that the pipes in this portion, besides being rotten, are so full of the accumulated filth of ages that the water, which is reasonably pure at source, on arrival in the town contains almost every imaginable type of germ. Europeans here consequently eschew it and even the native population, which is usually influenced by considera tions of price a great deal more than by those of hygiene, fights shy. 4. I am fflad to be able to say that this disquieting verdict on the water arriving in Jedda can now be revised. I enclose a portion of a memorandum by Mr G W Furlonge C) who has recently collaborated with the Indian medical officer in conducting 'an analysis of the water summarising the results and their probable effect on pilgrims. This analysis showed that from a bactenologica point of view, the water is reasonably innocuous even when it reaches the central ( l ) Not printed. [56 n—1]2 cistern from which it is distributed in the town after coming through the Turkish conduit. The latter is in two parts, a stretch of some 4 miles consisting of an underground conduit, partly cemented, and a further stretch of 3 miles consisting of earthenware pipes near the town. It is uncertain, on the other hand, whether a supply of really fresh water can be maintained, as the wells or pits sunk at Waziriya, where it seems to be possible to get water at almost any point in a largish area, appear to be fed by a seepage through the soil, and even though, the first water may be fresh, the flow tends as it comes from a greater distance, to become more saline. 5. You will see that Mr. Furlonge's conclusions are reassuring, as regards the probable effect of the new supplies in regard to pilgrims. At the same time it is certainly not of such a kind as to do away with the necessity for encouraging them by all possible means to take the precaution of boiling all water they use, or alternatively mixing a few grains of potassium permanganate with each bucketful and leaving it to stand for some time, before use, as recommended by Dr. Adbul Hamid. 6. I will bring this subject up to date in my pilgrimage report for this year. As in the meantime it is of general interest, I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the principal posts concerned with British and British-protected pilgrims, other than India, viz., Singapore, Jerusalem and Khartum. I am also sending copies to the Foreign Office and the Department of Overseas Trade. I have, &amp;c.

THE pilgrimage season of 1933 had scarcely been numbered with its predecessors when relations between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen became seriously strained. The presence of Hasan-al-Idrisi in the Yemen, recorded in paragraph 2 of the report for last year, inflamed the Imam's deep-seated discontent over the absorption of Asir into Saudi Arabia, and led him to take up cudgels for his protege in that province, and at the same time to embark on a military adventure in the obscure inland district of Najran, in regard to a part of which Ibn Saud claimed certain rather shadowy sovereign rights. The Imam's [10535] b2 P forces in the latter district pursued a series of desultory engagements with the ; local tribes of the Beni Yam during the autumn months, but Ibn baud was careful to refrain from participating in this local conflict. 2. Whilst himself mobilising his forces the King engaged the Imam in protracted negotiations, whose course it is unnecessary to follow more closely than to record that after abortive peace negotiations at Abha in February, when for some weeks the atmosphere had seemed less heavily charged, it was found impossible to avert the outbreak of war early in April 1934. 3. The Saudi forces triumphantly overran the coastal districts of the Yemen and captured Hodeida, so that the Imam, who was also faced with a difficult internal situation, concluded that the better part of valour was to yield. By the terms of the Treaty of Taif, signed on the 20th May, he agreed to surrender members of the Idrisi family, and accepted the Saudi terms in regard to Najran, the Asir frontier, &amp;c. This spectacular manifestation of his strength must do much to consolidate Ibn Saud's position at home, whilst in the Arab world he now occupies an eminence which, since the death of King Feisal of Iraq in 1933, he shares with no other Arab prince. 4. This upheaval in South-Western Arabia had singularly little effect on the 1934 pilgrimage. The patience and restraint with which Ibn Saud pursued his negotiations with the Imam were dictated as much by a desire to allow the forth coming pilgrimage to develop unmenaced by the hazards of war, as by any other consideration. He successfully staved off the ultimate recourse to arms until pilgrims from all quarters of the Moslem world had arrived, or were on the point of arriving, in the Hejaz. This skilful management of the situation was rewarded by increased numbers of pilgrims from practically all countries concerned, the only exceptions being of minor importance. Of the latter the Yemen, repre sented only by a handful of Shafei-Yemenis, was, of course, one, but here the figures for last year also were negligible; and, more interestingly, the Persian Gulf generally and Koweit in particular, where the diminution may be directly i attributed to the influence of Saudi-Yemen war rumours, for Koweit is the I veriest sounding-board of the Arabian Peninsula. Koweit also has been suffering increasingly from the stranglehold of the Saudi economic blockade, and this influence, too, might be expected to have played its part. Bokharans and Afghans also were considerably less numerous this year. 5. On other frontiers little occurred to disturb normal neighbourly relations. The negotiations-between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan, referred to in paragraph 3 of last year's report, ended happily in the signature of a treaty on the 27th July, 1933, at Jerusalem; relations with Iraq remained correct and friendly; whilst the Sheikh of Qatar paid a visit, rather enigmatically, to Eiyadh in September. Internally, the sky was no less clear, except for strong rumours during the autumn of tribal reluctance to honour the heavy drafts drawn by Ibn Saud on their resources of men and animals for the Yemen front. * 6. The total of overseas pilgrims in 1934 was 25,291, a welcome increase over the 20,705 of the previous year, though numbers still lagged behind the figure of 29,065 in 1932, then regarded as very meagre. 7. Pilgrimage Day, the 9th Dhu'l Hijja, fell this year on Sunday, the 25th March. In spite of the increase in overseas pilgrims, the congregation on Arafat numbered, according to Legation estimates, scarcely more than last year, viz., 50,000 inclusive of all local elements, although the Saudi estimate is some 10,000 higher. That this figure has remained stationary must be attributed partly to the effects of the economic depression, in the impoverishment of the Hejaz itself, and partly to the absence of Yemenis. 8. The climate was kinder even than last year, and the health of the pilgrimage was equally good. Saudi medical personnel showed a reduction over iast year, details of which will be given later in this report (see paragraph 44). 9. The visions conjured up by the concessions granted the previous year soon faded, and economic depression settled even more heavily over the Hejaz. Revenues contracted in spite of an increased pilgrimage; trade stagnated, with bazaars still containing goods unsold from last year; pilgrims were as meagrely turnished with money as ever; the salaries of Government officials were for the most part unpaid; the State Bank project described in paragraph 7 (a) of last years report came to nothing; and the Jedda-Mecca Railway dissolved like a mirage. On the other hand, the Standard Oil Company of California (see paragraph 7 (c) of last year's report) intervened with a timely loan of £35,000k gold (believed, however, to have found its way into the privy purse rather than the public exchequer). 10. There was thus no disguising the fact that the general financial situation had again deteriorated. The relief afforded by the oil company's subvention, together with the increased revenues flowing from a pilgrimage larger by 25 per cent, than the year before, failed to offset the evaporation of Government resources due to abnormal military expenditure and a decline in customs receipts, which, together with pilgrim dues, form the staple source of the Government's income, and which were even more heavily mortgaged than before (see paragraph 9 of last year's report). External indebtedness suffered in consequence. The 'debt chest ' was ransacked to meet domestic needs; and foreign creditors, including His Majesty's Government and the Government of India, still await a settlement. The year, therefore, witnessed greater insolvency at home and badly shaken credit abroad. 11. Nor did the schemes mentioned in paragraph 8 of last year's report present a much more cheerful contrast:— (a) The Sharqieh agreement was never effectively carried out, owing to Mr. Philby's difficulties with his principals. In November, therefore, without explicitly annulling the agreement, the authorities made arrangements with Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. for the delivery of a number of vehicles, granting Mr. Philby a similar contract on like terms a little later. Early in 1934, however, Mr. Philby had sufficiently overcome the scruples of the Ford Company to enable him to supply a further fifty Ford trucks, and in June he was understood to be treating with the Government for the renewal of his agreement on less onerous terms. (li) The Hyderabad textile scheme seemed, towards the end of the year, to be a ship sinking under the feet of numerous well-paid officers and an inconsiderable crew. A large part of the exiguous product (costing over 3 rupees per ihram) of this institution, is reported to have been thoughtfully disposed of in gifts to various Saudi officials and notables. (c) Negotiations with Messrs. Ibrahim Jewan Baksh in respect of the Mecca public electrical supply appear to have suffered an interruption. Meanwhile, regulations have been published restricting to Moslems the privilege of tendering for the supply of electricity to Mecca, but throwing open to non-Moslems as well eligibility for such services in the ports. 12. Propaganda was vigorously carried on much on the same lines as last year (see paragraph 11 of that report). Jemal Pasha was. it is believed, more discreet as a result of a sharp rebuke from the Saudi Minister of Finance requesting him to avoid the dissemination of misleading information. His activities are said to have included an attempt to collect funds for the estab lishment of a Moslem University at Mecca and efforts to enlist the interest of wealthy Indians in schemes of development in the Hejaz. A newcomer in propagandist ranks is a certain Dr. Shafi Ahmad, Ph.D., of Delhi. He has already issued a series of pamphlets, containing much erroneous matter, in connexion with the next Haj, but his strong advocacy of the ' long-sea' route (preferably by the Mogul Line) as against the overland route, is justifiably regarded by the Indian vice-consul as a saving grace (see paragraph 83 below). 13. Although no change was discernible in Saudi-Egyptian relations, and although there was no likelihood of the 'Mahmal' being sent from Egypt for the pilgrimage, interest in the Haj was successfully cultivated in that country, where Talaat Pasha Harb, chairman of directors of Banque Misr, was actively concerned in its promotion. He visited the Hejaz by air in November and concluded an arrangement with the Saudi authorities, the terms of which were not made public, but which were believed to provide for the functions of pilgrimage agent e.g., payment of Saudi dues, responsibility for transport and accommodation of pilgrims, &amp;c., to be undertaken by the representatives of Banque Misr At any rate a very satisfactory increase in the number of Egyptian pilgrims resulted, as many as 4,200 travelling by the steamship Zam Zam of the Egyptian Steam Navigation Company, a steamei recently acquired by this newl\ formed company with an eye to the transport of pilgrims. It may also be noted [10535] B 2r i^et Co here that an Egyptian doctor has now been attached permanently to the staff of the consulate here. A further reference will be made later to this, in the i appropriate place. 1 14. Improvements in the conditions in the Hejaz under which the pilgrimage is performed continued, on the whole, to mark time. The hotels f t mentioned in paragraph 12 (a) of last year's report were still maintained and were fairly well patronised in Mecca and Jedda, though not so well in Medina. The Government rest-houses on the roads were seldom used by pilgrims on accoimt of their excessive charges. The scheme of Sir Nizamat Jung to construct caravanserais on the Medina road was left in abeyance, but the sum of 8 ,000 rupees is still available, and it is hoped that a few rooms may be ready for use by the next Haj. A service of spare motor-lorries, engineers and spare parts, for the assistance of motor traffic on the Medina road, was in operation and will be more fully treated below (paragraph 74 (c)). 1 Ai 15. The inauguration of an orphanage by a philanthropic Indian resident pilp 1 at Medina is reported from that place. The institution is said to provide a ^ fC()11 free education, along vocational lines, in addition to food and shelter and that lis rill it now numbers over 100 boys. It promises to be a beneficial element in that i t S stricken town. Ifeek. 16. During the year Saudi Arabia seems to have advanced a little more confidently upon the sea. In the autumn she reconditioned one motor-launch i Til and purchased two others, whilst in 1934 the 'Arabian Steam Navigation Jed in Company '' was formed and acquired two small steamers from Beirut, destined I Tt to ply between the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. This rudimentary mercantile wicei marine was able to play a useful part in the operations against the Yemen, and may possibly be used, in future, for the transport of pilgrims. 17. There was a further fall in the exchange value of the riyal to about 25 riyals to the gold pound, though a temporary improvement to 23 riyals took place, as usual, at the height of the Haj. 18. Prices of food-stuffs in riyals remained about the same as last year, and the general purchasing power of pilgrims was still very low. 19. The high standard of security on the roads was maintained. One or two isolated cases of theft were severely punished. Pilferage was reported to have increased. 20. The King gave his annual pilgrim dinner on the 22nd March. The Indian vice-consul was not invited this year, indeed, the Afghan consul was the icancy, only foreign representative present. The Royal discourse was chiefly devoted ioient, to his troubles with the Yemen, and concluded with a fervent appeal for help to sieve; the Islamic world. tY ^ 21. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, due perhaps to his preoccupations with the iashort Yemen, gave no pilgrimage banquet this year. He was able, however, to entertain various notable foreign pilgrims, including Sir Nizamat Jung (who incidentally complained of being inconspicuously placed at the King's banquet), at Taif for ten days. Numerous leading Indian pilgrims were again accorded the privilege of free transport to Medina. 22. Ihe results of the unofficial memoranda submitted by the Indian vice- i er fJ consul to the King, mentioned in paragraph 17 of last year's report, will be dealt with later in the proper place. Che dismissal of the notorious Naqib of Indian Pilgrims at Jedda was its most important sequel. 23. A number of distinguished Indian pilgrims, both officials and others, ■ ^ a came on Haj this year. Among them were— Nawab Sir Nizamat Jung Bahadur of Hyderabad, Deccan; Khan Bahadur Ataur Rahman, Officiating Commissioner of Income Tax, Bengal; Khan Bahadur Abdul Aziz, Superintending Engineer. U.P.; Major Khawaj Moin I ddin, I.M.S., Hyderabad, Deccan; Shams-ul-Ulema A.N. Muhammad Waheed, I.E.S., Bengal; Dr. Mahomed Ullah Jung. M.A., LL.D., Barrister- at Law, Allahabad. ia| Fori [I) Fon |() Enli iij Resi :■ reasons utervene ttofcl ^ Lei Jomicij, ^kzi 1 he pilgi image was also notable as probably the first to be attended by unveiled Indian ladies of modern outlook and ideas. These included the sisters of his Highness the Nawab of Cambay, Begum Mahomedullah Jung and Fatmah Begum, lady superintendent of Municipal Girls' Schools, Bombay. The last named, it is worthy of note, was also selected to serve on the Hai Committees on the pilgrim ships steamship Rizwani and steamship Khosru. 31 Tin ited 01 tier s( l^ par % %icj lies,■&lt;fV w i laiii niife ym lei i I .nnTi t H h t fl ( Wp S H»f 0n J 11 ® ^ of importance was Bashid Ahmad of -f , Delhi, a lound table delegate on Ins way back to India. y Q 2 f; l \ ^ dlti on to the above list, other notable pilgrims this year were the k ex -Sultan of Muscat, his Highness Timur-bin-Faisal and the Emir of Muri from Nigeria. _ _ I^^ddition to Hasrat Mohani (see paragraph 21 of last year's report), Muhammad Irfan general secretary of the Central Khilafat Committee, Bombay, and Akhtar All 01 the Zemindar, were the only Indian agitators to perform the pilgumage this year. Ismail Ghuznavi and Muhammad Khan Ghazi Khan were again absent, but the latter put in an appearance after the Hai, and still remains here m search of employment, as his previous occupation of director of the Kiswa, a hot-bed of anti-British activity, has been refused him owing; to representations made by the Indian vice-consul. ^ rran g ement s f or the dispersal of the pilgrimage worked less satis factorily this year in respect of Indian pilgrims. Delays in the arrival of ships cost the companies the sum of about 3,000 rupees in compensation. Further details will be found at paragraph 127. 28. H.M.S. Penzance (Commander R. H. Bevan, R.N.) visited Jedda for Haj week. She stayed from the 22nd to the 29th March. Nine Moslem ratings made the pilgrimage during her stay. 29. The question of forged rupee notes remains unchanged from the position described in paragraph 25 of last year's report. 30. The Afghan consul in Bombay was again deputed by his Government for service in Jedda during the pilgrimage. He remained in this country for less than a month, during which time he presented his credentials to the Amir Feisal. 31. Considerable anxiety was aroused during the year by the attitude of the Saudi authorities towards foreign residents in this country, of African and Asiatic race. The activities of the authorities have taken the following forms : (a) Forcing foreign subjects to leave the country. (h) Forcing those allowed to remain to accept Saudi nationality. (c) Enlisting some for military service. (d) Restricting employment as chauffeur to Saudi subjects. The reasons given for {a) were the growth of the scandal and nuisance of mendicancy, particularly in the Holy Precincts in Mecca, and general lack of employment. The authorities denied the allegations under (b) and {c), and alfelf desisted eventually from {a). The question of chauffeurs was one of greater delicacy, but the exigences of the Yemen war constrained the Saudis to make good a shortage of chauffeurs by re-employing foreigners. A number of Indian tailors in Jedda were also similarly involved, but the Legation was able effectively to intervene on their behalf. The whole question has been, and still is, the alls I subject of close attention by the Legation, by whom representations have been made on numerous occasions. 32. Less expenditure was incurred this year on the weaving of the Kiswa, or cover for the Kaaba. No Indians were brought here for the purpose, Hejazis and domiciled Indians being employed. As already mentioned, Muhammad Khan Ghazi Khan was not re-employed, an Arab director being appointed in his stead. 33. As last year, no case of enslavement of pilgrims came to the notice of the Legation this year. (2) Statistics. 34. The following tables give the usual statistical information. The figures given are those prepared by the quarantine authorities, but it should once more he pointed out that discrepancies occur between these figures and those supplied from other sources. It is possible this year to add a further column in Table (A) giving separate particulars of arrivals (by dhow) at Lith. The official figures given hereunder represent the total number of pilgrims who landed at Jedda, Yanbu and Lith, during the period the 17th November, 1933, to the 22nd March, 1934. It will be observed that the largest increases in numbers are from Egypt, North Africa, Persia and China, with slighter increases from India and the Dutch East Indies. Afghans and Bokharans showed the most noticeable diminutions. \n AllTable (B). Number of Pilgrims arriving in the Hejaz hy S-ea, arranged by Countries of Embarkation. Country of Embarkation.

The usual quarantine measures were instituted at Kamaran, Tor and Suakin during the year under review. Kamaran. 36—(a) The amendment of the Indian Merchant Shipping Act providing compulsory vaccination and inoculation produced satisfactory results and con siderably improved conditions. No infectious case occurred on any ship. A child suspected of measles, on board the steamship Rahmani, before its arrival at Karachi, was isolated on board, but at Karachi the case was declared to be of a non-infectious character, and measures were taken to revaccinate and inoculate the child. Only three deaths occurred on Indian ships during outward voyages, and two births were also reported. (b) Accordingly, no ships from India, the Dutch East Indies and Malaya were detained for more than the time necessary for medical examination, nor had any pilgrim to land at Kamaran for quarantine purposes, although 282 were landed for disinfection. One of the chief causes of the exceptional good health observed by the Director of Quarantine on Indian ships, may be attributed to the introduction of the compulsory food system (see paragraph 139). ic) In view of the declaration of the Saudi medical authorities, verified by the Indian medical officer and the representative of the International Quarantine Board, that the pilgrimage was clean. His Majesty's Minister was able to dispense ships returning to India and Malaya with calling at Kamaran. But the presence of small-pox or chicken-pox in the Hejaz, led Sir Andrew Ryan to issue instruc tions to the Indian medical officer to ensure that pilgrims should not embark unless properly vaccinated and inoculated. Similar instructions were also conveyed to the ships' doctors. As a result three Takruni pilgrims were refused embarkation on the Khedivial Mail Line ship proceeding to Suakin, and one Indian on an India-bound ship. The Legation medical officer vaccinated and inoculated 455 persons proceeding by Indian pilgrim ships during the year under review, in addition to the number done at the local Government vaccination station opened at Jedda this year. In respect of the latter, Dr. Abdul Hamid was asked to satisfy himself that they had been regularly vaccinated and inoculated. Tor. 37. Returning pilgrim ships were subjected to the usual detention of three days. The Alexandria Quarantine Board declared the pilgrimage clean on the 9th April. Suakin. 38. Pilgrims returning to Africa via the Sudan underwent the usual five days' detention at Suakin. Two cases of small-pox occurred, but they were quarantined as usual, so that no cause for apprehension arose. Jedda. 39. No quarantine measures were necessary in respect of pilgrim ships or pilgrims this year. 40. The Port Medical Service was maintained by one doctor only. The senior. Dr. Yahya, went on leave, vide paragraph 41 of last year's report, and did not return. His assistant, Dr. Ibrahim Adham, acted single-handed as the Director of Quarantine during the year under review. During a short absence in Mecca, the local Medical Officer of Health acted for him. The Legation staff was not altogether happy again this year in regard to the performance by Dr. Ibrahim Adham of his duties in respect of pilgrim ships. He was, however, less disagreeable and obstructive than in the past. 41. Dr. Abdul Hamid Qassim came to Jedda as representative of the Alexandria Quarantine Board. He went to Mecca to perform the pilgrimage, but perhaps on account of the unfriendly terms subsisting between him and the Saudi Director-General of Public Health, no official recognition was accorded to him as representative of the board by the local medical authorities. 42. The projected opening up of an overland route for motor traffic from Iraq to the Hejaz will necessitate the inauguration of a quarantine station at aAct feail N suitable centre. Indian pilgrims who arrived by motor this year were detained by the authorities at Khanikm for a few hours, for examination of their travel documents and ceitiiicates of inoculation and vaccination. (4) Health. General. con ditions, as far as pilgrims were concerned, were good during the 1934 season, and climatic conditions were as favourable as the year before. As will be noted below (paragraph 51), the general health of the inhabitants of this country was by no means so satisfactory. Saudi Medical Service. es anil t 44. There was a considerable decrease in the total of medical personnel nation compared with 1933. With an increased pilgrimage and dislocation due to transfers to Asir for service with the Saudi forces, this can scarcely be regarded as satisfactory, ihe following is the distribution during the season, based on a list supplied by the Indian medical officer, except for transfers to Mecca for temporary service at the climax of the pilgrimage ;— Mecca. —Six, including the Director-General of Public Health, a dentist, a midwife, and a surgeon who remains for most of the year in Riyadh. Jedda. —Three, including one quarantine doctor and a lady doctor. The third doctor was sent to Jizan before the pilgrimage season began, and handed over his duties in connexion with the Jedda Hospital to his quarantine colleague. Medina. —One doctor. Taif. —One, but he was transferred to Army Headquarters at Abha before the pilgrimage season. Yanhu and Wejh. —A quarantine doctor at the former. The latter quarantine post has now been closed and the doctor removed. Riyadh. —Three, including the Royal physician. They all were trans ferred to Mecca for the height of the pilgrimage season. 45. This total of 15 (inclusive of the Royal physician and Riyadh staff, in comparison with 19 exclusive of those officers in 1933) comprises 9 Syrians, 3 Egyptians, including the 2 women, 2 Hejazis and 1 Turk. All but one are understood to have qualified in Beirut. The number of private practitioners showed some increase; the Dutch doctor, however, left for Holland upon completion of his contract. No change was reported in regard to pharmacists. 46. Hospitals, &amp;c., maintained a starved existence. The following particulars supplement those given in paragraph 46 of last year's report:— Mecca. —Only the central hospital and that at Gabban were in use. The condition of the former was much the same. The X-ray room has still to be brought into use, and the analyst's room has not yet been built. Dr. Mahmud Hamdi is active, however, in improving the hospital grounds. The isolation sheds outside the city were again unused, Gabban being used instead. o issue e ; report^ Jedda. —Remained for most of the year, and still is, without a doctor in charge. Nothing further has been done about a new hospital, but certain minor improvements are being made in the old one. It is said that the engagement of three Syrian doctors and two bacteriologists from Stambul has been sanctioned. ^ j Taif. —Dispensary has been without doctor for six months. Hasa. —Is still given over to the chauffeur-medico. 47. The Indian medical officer reports that the observations made in last year's report at paragraph 47 in regard to the defective medical service in this country, on the one hand, and the misleading accounts of it given in the Saudi pilgrimage guide, apply in their entirety and with even greater force this year. All pilgrims were charged for medicines, except those from whom charitable gifts were expected. The Government is said to have allocated £600 gold for [10535] c/ 10 the purchase of medicines, and to have levied, in Mecca only, a tax of 1 Saudi piastre per day on shopkeepers. There was the usual lack of smallpox vaccine in Mecca, but this year Jedda was more fortunate in this respect. 48. The following statement of cases treated and deaths in Government hospitals during the twelve months, the 1st June, 1933, to the 31st May, 1934, has been prepared by the Indian medical officer from weekly returns published in Number Disease. of Cases. Deaths. Dysentery ... 1,624 49 Paratyphoid 6 4 Typhoid 19 13 Puerperal fever 44 32 Smallpox 194 146 Measles 12 12 Meningitis ... 13 2 Leprosy 2 Syphilis 1,270 9 Diphtheria ... 2 1 Malignant fever Dengue '' 66 Consumption 173 76 Chicken-pox 12 Tetanus Whooping cough 56 15 Influenza 49 J'to jljffatei sited It is difficult to institute a comparison with last year's figures as those related to ten months only. Nevertheless, Dr. Abdul Hamid is of the opinion that small pox, measles, meningitis, syphilis, dengue and consumption are increasing, but the cautionary remarks in paragraph 49 of last year's report apply with equal force. Disease during the Pilgrimage Season. 49. Although smallpox was present amongst the local inhabitants of Mecca and Jedda, pilgrims appeared to remain unaffected by this and other infectious diseases, one case of smallpox only, a Bengali, being detected and rejected by the steamship Jehangir. Chicken pox was present during the actual pilgrimage, the Indian medical officer noticing two cases amongst Indians, two Javanese and three rejected by a Khedivial mail ship. Four cases occurred on the steamship Jehangir, bound for India, and two on a Khedivial mail ship bound for Suakin. 50. After the Haj a few cases of dysentery and diarrhoea, chiefly amongst Sindhi destitutes, were noticed. Influenzal catarrh was, however, more common, and malaria showed no decline, which, in view of the elementary sanitary arrangements here, is not a matter for surprise. No cases of sunstroke were observed at Arafat or Muna, but cases of heatstroke were successfully treated. 51. I he general health of the local inhabitants has been far from good. Measles and whooping cough have scourged almost every family, and chicken-pox, influenza, dysentery, diarrhoea, acute conjunctivitis and stomatitis have been much too prevalent. Much of the latter complaints may be attributed in part, Dr. Abdul Hamid considers, to infected local water supplies (see paragraphs 55 and 56 below). Mortality. 52. I he death rate this year is estimated by the Indian medical officer at not moi e than 0 03 per cent, for Indians and others, as against O'S per cent, for 1933. At Arafat one death only occurred, that of an enfeebled person, and at Muna deaths did not exceed a total of sixteen. General Sanitary Conditions. 53. These, briefly, may be described as lamentable. Conditions recorded in paragtaph 54 of last year s report, in regard to the absence of latrines, particularly at Muna, the disposal of carcases, prevalence of mosquitoes, &amp;c., were worse this ■tiers, Ci w, ach 'i Th Hi a staff weper (s separate wenol ^forni adjus ^ white I Th a h »i --y. '(wlier 'house Tli 1 % fiseto Wesy , { s P®sa StWinj ei ,Siiyear, although the Indian medical officer states that, in one respect, viz., the use }};. ) of phenyl at Muna, there was some improvement. There was no rain and a ^ violent sand and dust storni aggravated the state of affairs. Dr. Abdul Hamid also alleges relaxation in Mecca of municipal control of bread and other food shops during Haj weeks, so that not only does the unfortunate pilgrim suffer in his purse but, as the food is less carefully inspected, in his stomach too. 54. The temperature of Haj Day was a little higher than last year at from 89° to 96° F. Water Supply. 55. Conditions in Mecca were much the same this year, though at Arafat and Muna water was dearer, probably due to increased demand, the price rising to 10 piastres a tin of 4 gallons. 56. The Jedda water-supply from (&lt;2) the sea-water condenser, (&amp;) the ' Saharij ' or rain-water reservoirs, and (c) well-water was this year supplemented by [d] water from Waziriyeh. In paragraph 57 of last year s report this was pronounced normally healthy at source, as a result of tests applied by the Indian medical officer. Further tests during the autumn showed that the water arrived in the town cistern considerably polluted after having traversed 7 miles of conduit, a part of which was decayed and clogged with detritus. Further work by the Ain Zubeyda Committee in the catchment area served to increase the volume of water, the flow in course of time sweeping the conduit clean of the accumulated rubbish. The pipe itself was also cemented and repaired, with the result that further tests at the beginning of 1934 revealed that the water now arriving in the Jedda cistern, although rather too saline for a sensitive palate, is reasonably safe. The local committee bestirred itself, money was collected and philanthropic Indian notables, among others, Sir Rahim Baksh and Sheikh Muhammad Amin Brothers, Calcutta, gave financial assistance, whilst Jewan Baksh promised to provide metal piping to convey the water gratis to various distributing points in the town. Consignments of pipes have already arrived or are en route. One of the distributing points will be the Quarantine Quay, a facility which may be expected to be of great benefit to pilgrims. The precaution of boiling Waziriyeh water, or of mixing a few grains of potassium permanganate with each bucketful is, however, advised by Dr. Abdul Hamid. Government of India Dispensaries. 57. The Jedda Dispensary remained open as usual throughout the year r with a staff augmented this year by an additional dispenser, fourth grade, and a sweeper (see paragraph 39 of last year's report). More ambitious proposals for separate hospital accommodation were submitted to the Government of India, but were not accepted owing to the present financial stringency. The increased indent for medicines was this year queried by the Government of India, but after minor adjustments was substantially allowed. Certain improvements, e.g., tiling, whitewashing, &amp;c., were carried out during the year. 58. The Mecca Dispensary opened on the 20th January and closed on the 20th May, Dr. Hamid Husain, who served in a similar capacity in 1930, being appointed sub-assistant surgeon. His work and that of his staff was again satisfactory. Arrangements for Haj week, including attendance at Arafat and Muna (where the Indian vice-consul and Indian medical officer were obliged to hire a house at their own expense), were similar to those for the previous two years. 59. The attitude of the Director-General of Public Health towards the Mecca Dispensary, adverted to in paragraph 60 of the report for last year, gave rise to a sharp passage with the local authorities this year. His studied discourtesy towards Dr. Abdul Hamid, when the latter was in Mecca to open the dispensary, was followed by an ultimatum to Dr. Hamid Husain to produce his diplomas, in default of which further action was promised. His Majesty's Minister took the matter up with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but no reply having been received from Amir Feisal (indeed, in the meantime, the Director-General had weighed in with an even stiffer communication to Dr. Hamid Husain) Sir Andrew Ryan telegraphed to Ibn Saud complaining of the conduct of Dr. Mahmud Hamdi. The King replied that he was causing an enquiry to [10535] c 212 be made. The question of the dispensaries generally was the subject of subse quent conversations between Sir Andrew Ryan and Fuad Hamza and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. but the position remains to be cleared up as this report is being prepared. Cases Treated in the Indian Dispensaries. 60. The total number of cases treated at the Jedda Dispensary from the 1st June, 1933, to the 31st May, 1934, was 42,500 as compared with 44,914 for the previous twelve months. Of these, the number of Indian pilgrims treated at Jedda between the 8th December, 1933, and the 31st May, 1934, was 4,841, as compared with 4,625 of last year. The number of cases treated at Mecca from the 20th January to the 20th May was 13,109, as compared with 12,125 last year. During a three days' stay at Muna, 210 cases were treated. 61. Indoor cases this year totalled forty-seven, as compared with thirty- four last year. The remarks in paragraph 62 of last year's report in this connexion still apply, as the new fourth grade dispenser is not able to undertake the work of a qualified anaesthetist. Dr. Abdul Hamid performed 360 major operations and 2,864 minor operations during the year under review. 62. The observation contained in paragraph 63 of last year's report apply in respect of this year as, to a comparison in numbers treated in the Indian and the Saudi medical institutions. The total amount collected from patients for medicines supplied amounted to 559 riyals. 63.

The practice, noted in paragraph 65 of last year's report, in respect of charge of 5 rupees to cover cost of transport on visits being made to patients in their own quarters was followed again this year. 65. The difficulty with regard to dispensing outside prescriptions (see paragraph 82 of 1932 report and paragraph 67 of 1933 report) occurred again this year. The Indian medical officer, in refusing such requests, explained the reasons for this attitude. Other Foreign Medical Assistance. 66. The Egyptian consulate, as recorded at paragraph 13, has now a medical officer. Dr. Ali Asghar-al-Ghandour, as permanent member of the staff. He has been here eight months and still awaits medical supplies and instruments. I he Indian medical officer hears of somewhat unhappy ventures in diagnosis that, it is said, have marked his professional debut here.

Medical Arrangements on Pilgrim Ships. 69 ' -?- he ^ m 1 end ^ d Indian Merchant Shipping Act of 1933 and the Indian Pilgrim ohjp Rules have effected certain improvements in medical arrangements on board ships. For further reference to the Act, and such matters as the compulsory food system, see paragraphs 139 et seq. Motor Transport. (5) Internal Trans P ort ™ the Hejaz. 70. In spite of the obvious importance of the conveyance of pilgrims to the Holy Cities by motor, the Indian vice-consul reports that little has been done during the 1934 pilgrimage to improve the condition of rolling-stock and its equipment. He criticises the action of the Government authorities in using motor vehicles, imported by them for military purposes, in competition with the motor transport companies. The Government, by registering their vehicles with the 'Naqaba,' or motor transport administration, were able thus to participate, to the extent, it is estimated, of one-third of the total, in this business at the expense of the regular companies. The latter, severely handicapped financially by the operations of a governmental competitor, were unable to effect renewals in and the reconditioning of their rolling-stock, and were obliged to run worn-out vehicles on the rough-and-ready roads of this country. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah describes the subterfuge, which consisted chiefly in the transfer of equipment, &amp;c., from one car to another, by which companies were able to evade the not very rigorous official inspection of vehicles at the beginning of the season. 71. This unsatisfactory state of affairs inevitably spelt discomfort, delay and even hardship for pilgrims. Further difficulties experienced by them, in connexion with motor transport, may be summarised as follows :— {a) With an eye to revenue, the authorities, the Indian vice-consul avers, permitted Medina-going pilgrims to leave Mecca first, and arranged for them to take the best transport. Thereupon, those anxious to return home at once after visiting Mecca were allowed to leave in the sadly dilapidated vehicles remaining. Not only were transport companies themselves exposed to difficulties and loss, but pilgrims suffered considerable hardship, one party being as long as three days over so short a journey. (&amp;) Delays also took place, in respect of vehicles bound for Medina, on the stretch Mecca-Jedda, in spite of the special examination such vehicles are supposed to undergo before leaving Mecca. Efforts, in a number of cases, were made by the Indian vice-consul to have cars changed at Jedda for the onward journey to Medina. (c) Owin 0 ' to the war with the Yemen and the demand for chauffeurs for military transport, and further, owing to the Government's policy of excluding as far as possible chauffeurs of foreign nationality from employment, transport companies were obliged to engage inexperienced persons to drive their vehicles, a fact which accentuated the discomfort of the pilgrims. Even though the authorities relaxed the regulations with regard to foreign chauffeurs, many of these had left the country and, the demand exceeding the supply, wages increased, especially for trips to Arafat, for which short distance chauffeurs were paid up to £4 gold. . ^ {d) Complaints were made of the inclusion of pilgrims of several nationalities in one bus -load. . , {e) In order to earn a gratuity from motor owners, muzawwars are said to have brought pressure to bear on pilgrims to leave Medina before the completion of the prescribed observances.14 (/) An Indian pilgrim was reported to have been killed by a bus on the Jedda-Medina road, but no particulars have been received to enable further investigation. The driver is said to be still in prison at Medina. {g) No special arrangements were made this year for the hotels to run cars for their clients. (h) Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah reports a singular case of double-dealing. A Punjabi chauffeur, a favourite of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, was granted a free ' Koshan ' in 1933 for thirteen members of his family to visit Medina. But the chauffeur, instead of utilising it for himself, sold the permit to a party of thirteen Indian pilgrims of Delhi, whom he passed off as his family, and provided them with a bus outside Naqaba control, through the intermediary of a sabee. The pilgrims duly travelled to Medina, but the fraud was discovered on their return journey, when the chauffeur was arrested and the party detained at Medina undergoing serious hardship. Subsequently, on reference of the case to the Minister of Finance, the pilgrims were allowed to return on the same bus, whilst the offending chauffeur is said to have escaped with a warning. 72. As in 1933, pilgrims generally were allowed to go from Mecca to Arafat by motor. The charges were as last year, per car and per bus, instead of per pilgrim, viz., £13 gold for a bus, and £9 and £6 gold for six- and four-seater cars respectively. 73. In view of the difficulties experienced this year in connexion with motor transport, the King summoned, after the Haj, a special meeting of notables of Mecca and Jedda, owners of motor companies, representatives of the Majlis-as Shura and the Ministry of Finance, to study the question and consider remedial measures. 74. Of the various proposals embodied in a memorandum of Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah (see paragraph 79 of the 1933 report), the following matters connected with motor transport may be noted :— {a) The proposal to construct a shed at the entrance gate at Mecca was not pursued, the Minister of Finance being, it may be supposed, too heavily engaged with the war with the Yemen. The proposal that 'Koshan ' officials should note times of arrival and departure of vehicles was partially adopted. Arrangements for the assistance of transport on the roads were further developed. Three spare lorries with mechanics were stationed at Rabigh and Masajid, and one each at Dahban and Bir Ibn Husayn. ■^? w ^ s ^ a ^ ons ' w ith three lorries each, were also opened at Mastura and Bir Sheikh on this road, whilst the usual repair stations, &amp;c., were opened on the Jedda-Mecca road. Soldiers were also posted, after the Haj, at difficult points on this road. {d) Arrangements for the inspection in Mecca of vehicles bound for Medina were also tightened up, and delays at Jedda were greatly reduced. The need for a ' sabee ' to accompany each bus of pilgrims to Medina, again became the subject of consideration and some complaint. The question of excluding the sabee from buses was not pressed, as the present system has certain advantages. 75. ^ It is estimated that about 60 per cent, of the Indian pilgrimage visited Medina in motor vehicles this year. Camels. 76. There is little of fresh interest to report. Economic depression still leads considerable numbers, both for Mecca and Medina, and much larger numbers for Arafat, to travel by camel. Cabs. on ^^e representation of the cab-owners, the Government pro hibited the general use of buses and lorries in the town of Mecca during the months of Dhu 1 Qaada and Dhu 1 Hijja of the year under review. An exceptional treatment was, however, granted this year in respect of cars, which Ufs ( (P) ( c ) Ag ill Si: fert-cuts Mc M s n ide in m in (^) Th ^rei . % llacm si itrequired no peimission to enter the town. Buses carrying pilgrims of favourite mutawwifs or those of other notables, it was noticed, were also allowed to enter |he town, on the permission of the chief of police. Dhows. 78. The arrangement between Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co. and the authorities in India for the conveyance of pilgrims and their luggage between ship and shore, having expired this year, the Government of India were asked to sanction the continuance of the system for a further two years. Certain modifications were suggested for incorporation in the new contract, based on the experience of the past two years. Qeneral. 79. Again no attempt was made to prevent pilgrims from travelling on foot between Mecca and Jedda, and many of the poorer pilgrims did so travel. But the prohibition against footing it to Medina was strictly enforced, and two domiciled Sindhis were imprisoned for acting as guide, taking pilgrims to Medina by short-cuts. 80. Motives of economy still led a few hundred pilgrims to postpone their trip to Medina until after the reduction of the ' koshan ' (see paragraph 81 of last year's report). A Government announcement that this reduction would only oe made in favour of Saudi subjects, was eventually relaxed on telegrams of protest being addressed to the King. 81. Indians, resident in Medina, were deprived this year of the privilege of visiting Mecca during the Haj on the same reduced 'koshan ' rates as for Saudi subjects. In consequence, many who could not afford the higher rates either stayed away or travelled by camel. The Minister of Finance who was approached by the Indian vice-consul, promised sympathetic consideration next year of a request for the restoration of this privilege. 82. One car- and two bus-loads of Indian pilgrims for the first time arrived from India by land all the way. They suffered many vicissitudes, and, to their great chagrin, were late for the pilgrimage. They addressed complaints both to this Legation and to the local authorities; some returned by the same means, some remained in the Hejaz, while a number returned by sea to prefer claims against the motor company on arriving back in India. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah attributes this ill-starred expedition.to the activities of Ismail Ghuznavi. 83. Agreement over the overland route from Iraq, referred to in paragraph 84 of last year's report, has now been reached, it is reported, between the Saudi and the Iraqi Governments. Very considerable developments and changes ip the transport of pilgrims to this country may be expected to follow. 84. Once again two adventurous Indians came on pilgrimage on bicycles. They failed to get as far as Medina and had to dispose of their machines. Both men returned to India by sea, one as a destitute and the other with the help of charitable friends. (6) Customs. 85. There was no change in the year under review in administration of the customs. Smufferling; was still active and venality more pronounced, the lat er due to the fact that Government officials for a large part of the year received no salary. This proved of no little benefit to pilgrims, who, with the help ot judicious gratuities, experienced less trouble, this year. Complaints^were, however, received of confiscation of cigarettes, leaf-cigarettes ( bin ) and betel nuts, and in some cases of somewhat sharp practice by mutawwifs. 86. Numerous amendments to the Saudi customs tariff were announced on the 15th June, 1934. The new duties, whose effect it is at present difficult to assess, represent a further development of the new tariff introduced m May 1933, many lacunae being filled by tlie designation of specific duties on articles previously not separately shown or subject to ad valorem duties Duties on certain important commodities, e.g., rice, wheat and flour, have been standardised, and, it appears probable, will bring in an increased yield ot revenue.16 (7) Religious Policy. 87. The tendency, noted in paragraph 90 of last year's report, towards a more liberal attitude to other than Wahabi sects of Islam happily continued during the year under review. Many pilgrims are said to have visited the ' Ghar-al-Hara, Ghar-al-Thor,' hitherto forbidden, and Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah relates that a few riyals to the Nejdi guard enabled an educated Indian pilgrim to visit the tomb of the Lady Khadija the Great, by night. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman again expressed his anxiety that causes for annoyance to other sects should be removed, whilst the Committee of Virtue now chastise neither with whips nor scorpions. 88. This atmosphere of harmony and quiet has been disturbed by one or two incidents of no particular significance :— (a) A certain Moulvi Ahmad Dehlavi, now settled in Medina, delivered himself, in the Haram there, during the pilgrimage rush season, of some bitter diatribes against non-Wahhabi sects. He was severely assaulted by outraged Sunnis and Shias, but was rescued by the police, his assailants being arrested and punished. (b) A lady of modern ideas and culture, the wife of an Allahabad barrister, Dr. Mahomedullah S. Jung, LL.D., M.A. (see paragraph 23 above)' had secured the privilege of kissing daily the Holy Railings at Medina by payment of a regular gratuity to one of the Nejdi guards there. This did not save her, it would seem, from receiving three blows of a cane from another guard. She refused to pursue the matter further. {c) The Patna community in Jedda, who have a mosque of their own, recently celebrated the ceremony of ' Moulad an Nabi.' As a result, two leading members of the community were summoned to the police station, and seriously warned. {d) Two separate cases are reported of Takruni sheikhs, well known for witchcraft, being expelled from the country. 89. The Indian vice-consul alludes to the intolerance displayed by Indians of the Wahhabi persuasion, domiciled in this country. He attributes this to the bitter memories of the treatment received by them in India at the hands of Moslems of other sects. (8) Mutawwifs. 90. There was no change of cardinal importance in mutawwif's organisa tion during the twelve months under review. The recommendations of the Indian vice-consul, in consultation with the Minister of Finance (see para graph 107 (a) of last year's report), received the Royal approval, and it was hoped that the matters adverted to in paragraph 120 of the 1932 report and paragraphs 107 and 108 {h) of the 1933 report would be remedied. One immediate result was the removal of the notorious ' naqib ' of Indian pilgrims at Jedda, who is also himself the wakil of a large number of Indian mutawwifs (he had under his charge no less than 11,000 pilgrims one season). He was given the alternative of keeping either the agency of Indian mutawwifs only or that of non-Indians. He chose the latter, and his Indian agencies were in consequence distributed amongst other wakils. 91. The ex-naqib, however, could not stomach being so unceremoniously ejected, and duiing the Indian vice-consul's absence on leave during the summer of 1933, succeeded in climbing back into his old saddle. He was assisted in this by the common knowledge that Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah had been the instru ment of his fall, and by the feeling he was in consequence able to stir up by leterences to unwarranted interference by foreign representatives in matters of domestic concern to Saudi Arabia. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah persevered, however, through the Minister of Finance, and eventually secured, by Royal order, the redismissal of the naqib, who, however, managed through the influence of Amu Feysal to retain his agencies until the season was over, to avoid any dislocation. 92. The adoption of the recommendations mentioned in paragraph 108 (b) or last year s report, in respect of pilgrims not returning to their countries at ly of f17 expenditure and dly.^ ProVed a decided adranta g e minimising both '* k- 9 1'«f T W?h eStl0n i, 0f tlle co ' d ' ct of mutawwifs, &amp;c., in India was also the W sub 3 e ^ of f ult hei exchanges. A Royal injunction, endorsing the Indian vice- ^ ^ consul s recommendation, was first issued and then later withdrawn. The ki 5 ; Legation thereupon issued visas of limited validity only, until the Minister of fl!n i Fmance took up the matter again, and, after His Majesty's Minister had ^lU communicated with the Government of India on the subject, Khan Bahadur ' [ c Ihsanullah was able to agree with Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman upon the terms of a cautionary instruction to mutawwifs. The Legation now prefers to wait until the bena\ioui of mutawwifs whilst in India becomes the subject of further remark. active intervention of the Indian vice-consul in the question of the mutawwif system becoming public property had at least the salutary effect of Educing m mutawwiis and their wakils a more amenable spirit. This, and the HeffiJ black-list, which has been maintained as usual this year, are useful as sanctions i^; to curb the more disagreeable tendencies of these persons. 95. The following instances of misconduct bv mutawwifs are cited by Khan ^ Bahadur Ihsanullah : — [■pply { a ) Anticipation of a reduced pilgrimage led to numerous instances of the lings it! | nature mentioned in paragraph 99 (a) of last year's report. (b) There were again cases of the taking of loans and dues in advance by mutawwifs. On receipt of complaints, however, the wakils were compelled to refund the amounts so taken. - my Amongst cases of loss of luggage investigated, was one concerning the Asa J ^ oss a trunk, said to contain 1,000 rupees. Enquiries here failed to trace the trunk, but a cable to a ship which had sailed a day earlier led to the discovery of the trunk on board. tali i 96. Difficulties were again experienced this year in connexion with the payment of dues in advance at Jedda. ' Poor pilgrims attempted to evade payment and were detained, in some cases for weeks. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, who discouraged this evasion, recounts how a party of Sindhis, who cleverly handed at u V their pilgrim passes and return tickets to other pilgrims on board for custody and landed as destitutes, were neatly foiled by the local authorities, who soon persuaded them to produce the missing documents by threats to return the offenders to India forthwith as stowaways. 97. There was no change in the Taqrir system. Complaints were received of the inconvenience resulting from several mutawwifs for one family, whose members happened to reside in different districts of Behar. 98. The appointment of a separate Sheikh of Mutawwifs for Indian pilgrims (see paragraph 102 of last year's report) proved of great help to the Indian vice-consul in dealing with complaints against mutawwifs at Mecca. 99. Indian pilgrims of the Shia faith are allotted to a different Sheikh of Mutawwifs from other Indians. Some difficulty arose this year in this respect, and the Minister of Finance promised Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah that for the future he would place Shiah Indians as well as the others under one Sheikh of Mutawwifs. 100. Several complaints have again reached the Indian vice-consul of the eiEC# misconduct of certain of the muzawwars of Medina against Indian pilgrims. These could not be closely investigated as no arrangements have yet been possible 0m for Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah to visit that place. W ; aSP] (9) Pilgrimage Tariff and Cost of Pilgrimage. leH M ii#| 101. The Saudi Minister of Finance's intimation, recorded at paragraph 122 {a) of last year's report, that the 1933 tariff would probably be applied in 1934 without substantial alteration, was borne out by the event. The only difference consisted of the cancellation of the remission of Zamzam water fees in respect of Malabaris, Sindhis and Afghans, yet these, on arrival, were exempted from payment of these fees in advance at Jedda, and were allowed to Pay them at Mecca. Very few, in fact, paid in full; many paid nothing at alL [10535] D18 (iMi lis to AD ( fazir itlepr to: lies to i i, wli The The andf 102. The Legation were enabled to circulate on the 17th October the general tariff, privately received from the Minister of t inance, to the Government of India and other British Governments interested in the pilgrimage, and were also enabled to prepare, as last year, an estimate of the probable cost of the pilgrimage. The latter was forwarded to the Government of India on the 8th October, and was subsequently reproduced in the guide for pilgrims, published by the Govern ment of India early in 1934. 103. The adoption of the recommendation noted at paragraph 122 (c) of last year s report proved of great advantage and eliminated a fruitful source of complaint in the past, viz., that pilgrims were compelled to sit on their luggage in Jedda waiting for an indefinite ship to arrive, when they might have been spending the time more pleasantly in Mecca. 104. The question adverted to in paragraph 122 (b) of last year's report, namely, to make Jedda wakils responsible, in return for a small fee, for pilgrims stopping the night at Jedda whilst en route between Medina and Mecca, was not S'grei pursued, in view of the improvement in the arrangement for inspecting transport described in paragraph 74 {d) above. 105. The proposal to separate that part of a mutawwif's fees destined for the Government from the portion he would retain, referred to in paragraphs 122 {d) and 123 of last year's report, was not pursued. 106. The suggestion, urged by Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, that a definite fee for muzawwars at Medina should be fixed, could not be pursued. Complaints, however, have again been received and in the absence of sanction for the vice- consul to proceed to Medina such steps as are possible will be taken with the Minister of Finance. 107. The two active propagandists' in India of the Saudi Government, namely, Ismail Ghuznavi and Jemal Pasha El Ghazi, restrained their propensity to contradict the published tariff. Certain complaints were, however, heard that the latter had been representing the cost of the pilgrimage to be less than the published minimum. Perhaps, as a result of this, a number of pilgrims arrived here with insufficient funds. 108. The same difficulty noted in paragraph 120 of last year's report, in provin respect of the payment of dues in advance, arose again this year. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah reports that as a result of a private understanding with the Minister of Finance, he was able to arrange that all cases of genuine destitution should eventually be allowed to go to Mecca. These, however, had to wait on the settle ment of the undeserving cases, who were detained in Jedda until the dues were forthcoming. This, of course, meant the detention of the destitutes as well and the Khan Bahadur records his embarrassment at the spectacle of fellow country men reduced to mendicancy in the streets of Jedda (also see the last sentence of the previous paragraph). 109. A further difficulty arose over the insistence of Indian pilgrims in paying their Government dues in Indian currency, as published in the guide. iy er p ro It has, of course, been emphasised more than once that the items of the Saudi s tariff are fixed in terms of gold and that any change in the exchange value of gold would substantially alter the estimates. This, however, is sometimes not easy for the average pilgrim to understand, but the Indian staff of the Legation endeavoured to make the point clear. When the estimates were prepared the market rate was 20 rupees to the gold £, but when Pilgrimage Day approached the rate was nearer 23^ rupees. 110. The tariff, once again, did not include charges for motor transport from Mecca to Arafat and back. They were fixed shortly before Pilgrimage Day at inclusive rates, which are given at paragraph 72 above. 111. Transport charges for Medina were the same as those for last year. As many as 300 pilgrims again postponed their visit there until the usual reduction of ' Koshan ' and motor fares, as long as two months after the Haj (see paragraph 80 above). Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah would counsel poorer pilgrims not to spend their substance in waiting in Mecca for a reduction that |! one of these years might not materialise. Many pilgrims again travelled to Medina on single tickets. 112. Domiciled Indians at Mecca, as well as those pilgrims who remained in this country since last year, were treated on the same footing as citizens in the year under review, and enjoyed the privilege of reduced rates of ' Koshan' for m.19 Arafat and Muna, and also for Jedda. The question of domiciled Indians in Medina has been dealt with in paragraph 81 above. 113. An unofficial attempt was made by the members of the Waziriyeh Committee to arrange with the wakils at Jedda to collect a sum of one-fourth of a rupee from each pilgrim, together with the local dues, &amp;c., as a subscription for the Waziriyeh Fund. This report reached the Indian vice-consul, who opposed the proposal that any sum, even for charity, should be collected from pilgrims in such a manner. (10) Indian Pilgrimage. 114. Iii paragraph 124 of last year s report, His Majesty's Minister Uorfi proposed to review, early in 1934, the position reached in regard to questions concerning the Legation, as a result of consideration of the Haj Enquiry Committee's reports and the Legation's annual reports. But, due to the pressure of other work and the recent war in Arabia, it is regretted it has not been possible for him to pursue the matter. Sir Andrew Ryan, however, has addressed several despatches to the Government of India regarding various questions of Indian pilgrimage, which will be mentioned in the appropriate paragraphs below. 115. The Indian Pilgrimage began this year with the arrival of the steam ship Jehangir on the 7th December, 1933, and ended with that of the steamship Rizwani on the 19th March, 1934. 116.

Any difficulty in reconciling the foregoing figures with those in paragraph 34 is due to causes similar to those indicated in paragraph 117 above. The total is 2,681 as compared with 3,996 in 1933. Afghans, Arabs from the Persian Gulf and pilgrims from Chinese Turkestan were mainly responsible for the decrease. Persians have abandoned the route via India to the Hejaz since last year ; the coastal Arabs have also adopted the overland route instead of travelling via India. 120. According to information obtained from mutawwifs, the numbers of Indian pilgrims who arrived from other than Indian ports, as well as of those who left by other routes, were as follows :— Suez ... Arrivals. Departures. 88 75 Port Sudan 6 Beirut 12 59 Aden ... 11 66 South Africa ... 66 14 Dutch East Indies and Malaya 2 Zanzibar 30 Suakin 2 185 246 In addition to the above, forty-three Indian pilgrims arrived by motor vehicles from India; and 526 on foot via Nejd, Yemen, Iraq and Palestine, who were repatriated eventually at the expense of the Government of India. 121. The Mogul Line (Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co.) was again the only line engaged in the pilgrimage traffic from India this year. 122.

( 2 ) This figure includes 541 destitutes who came overland, including 15 of those who travelled in motor vehicles but returned by steamer; and also 97 Hadhramis who either arrived by other ships or had been resident in the Hejaz. To this a further number of 329 can be added, those who came from India during the non-pilgrimage season and returned after the Haj. If these num! ers be deducted from the figure for homeward bound pilgrims, the disparity between it and the number of arrivals amounts to 794, made of 449 persons whose return tickets are still held in deposit in the Legation, and 345 others, mainly Hejazis returning from India and remaining in the Hejaz, or pilgrims who went north ward to visit other holy places. 124. The following table shows the distribution of the totals given in the preceding paragraph by ports of embarkation and destination. Owing to the introduction of the compulsory food system, it has been possible this year to give the exact number of pilgrims who returned to Bombay or Karachi : ne, P. Port.

Return of Pilqrims to India: Geneial. . 197 AlthonP-h the number of arrivals this year from Indian ports was a few hundred more^than last year, arrangements for the return journey were less22 satisfactory. Pilgrims, who arrived at Jedda after the first rush was despatched,, had to wait here for a longer period. On the sailing of almost each ship after the steamship Rizwani on the 14th April, some hundreds of pilgrims had to see with disappointment steamers sailing with full complement, and they were left behind due to the lack of accommodation. I he table at paragraph 122 above shows the interval between the sailing of each ship and the arrival of the next, in respect of the last three ships, as ten, sixteen and twenty-two days respectively. The shipping company concerned had even to pay a fine of 2,992 rupees for the detention of 704 pilgrims awaiting repatriation, whose period of detention was as follows :— i No. of Pilgrims. 9 213 131 141 98 26 86 Detention period. 22 21 20 14 18 17 16 Allowance paid for. 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 ^ v y Ac 128. Besides the above figure of 704, which includes Indians only, there was a number of foreign pilgrims also detained, but who were unable, of course, to claim compensation under the amended Act. Although their number was not large this year, the Legation was nevertheless approached by these persons, who felt aggrieved at the differential treatment accorded to pilgrims travelling from the same ports and under similar circumstances. It is feared that, if a larger number of foreign pilgrims, travelling from Indian ports, were to be detained here in future years, considerable difficulty may be anticipated, both to them and to the representative of their Government, especially in respect of Afghans. 129. As a result of the inadequacy of the shipping company's fleet of ships for the transport of pilgrims to India, a number of seventy-five pilgrims, who travelled to the Hejaz with Mogul Line return tickets, tired of their prolonged stay at Jedda, obtained refunds, and booked passages by an Italian ship bound for India via Massawah. They were, however, refused embarkation on that ship at the eleventh hour. Some of them proceeded to India via Aden, and the others remained at Jedda, to be treated as fresh purchasers of tickets having lost claim to their original return tickets. 130. Besides the above, the general attitude of the local Italian company was responsible for other incidents. Some Indian pilgrims who intended to travel to Zanzibar or other ports by their ships, and were booked as cabin passengers, were ultimately compelled to travel as deck passengers. They made representations to this Legation, but nothing could be done to assist them. 131. Many better-class pilgrims, who travelled with first- or second-class return tickets, took up a good part of the Indian vice-consul's time by their persistent requests to book their passages by telegram, &amp;c., in advance, in contravention of the established rotation system. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah tried to explain to them the difficulties and undesirability of complying with their requests, with but indifferent success in some cases. 132. 1 he adoption of the recommendation mentioned in paragraph 103 above proved a great relief to the better-class pilgrims, who returned to Mecca and remained there till the arrival of their ships. 133. The proposal of Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co. to arrange for the building of a special ship accommodating a large number of first- and second-class passengers, which it is expected will be launched in time for the next pilgrimage, will, it is hoped, help to remove the difficulties of the pilgrims of the above category in this respect. The number of pilgrims holding first- and second -class tickets, who elected to travel in a lower class this year, in order to avoid delay, fell this year to twenty. The Indian vice-consul again attributes this in part to the fact that some pilgrims, aware of the difficulties in the past, preferred to travel from India to Jedda on single tickets, and partly to the fact that some pilgrims, having obtained refunds on their return tickets, travelled by different routes. 134. bome difficulty was experienced this year in respect of pilgrims who desired to obtain refunds on their return tickets from the local shipping agents. if wn teo Pilg I M tcd wit ill cases :ETenf( IE Ti p wit rap piac23 and to travel by other routes^ Ihe agents of the Mogul Line, who also represented the new Egyptian Steam Navigation Company, a competitor of the Khedivial Mail Line, wanted to book these pilgrims by the former against their wishes; and, accordingly, to the resentment of pilgrims, withheld the refunds in order to include the amount in the fresh passage. However, the Indian vice-consul took suitable measures to prevent this. * 135. Complaints were received, both from pilgrims and from members of the Committee of Pilgrims on the ships, regarding the difficulties of re-embarka tion at Jedda. The solution of this problem was to fit four ladders instead of two, as suggested to the Government of India. Unfortunately, Messrs. Turner, Morrison refused to comply with the proposal, although the much smaller ships of the Khedivial Line, employed in the Red Sea for the transport of pilgrims, carry four ladders. The usual unseemly scramble to secure good places can also be avoided by a stricter adherence to Rules 69 and 70 of Indian Pilgrim Ship Rules, 1933. 136. Other complaints made by the persons mentioned in the above paragraph were in connexion with the luggage, lack of accommodation on the ship and the extortion by dhowmen. The latter point has been taken up with the Government of India (see paragraph 78 above). As regards the congestion made by unnecessarily bulky luggage, measures to discourage pilgrims from carrying with them heavy luggage would be most useful, whilst a stricter observance of the rule for keeping luggage in the ships' hold would materially assist. Pilgrims should be allowed to keep with them only the necessities for the voyage. 137. Minor complaints were received from a number of pilgrims who had children with them. The shipping company in India issued half-tickets in several cases to children below 12 years of age, while many were charged at full rates, even for children of the age of 3 years. 138. The Indian Section of this Legation issued 582 emergency passes to pilgrims without other papers, in accordance with the arrangements mentioned in paragraph 171 of 1932 report. Food. 139 &gt; _( a ) For the first time in the annals of the Indian pilgrimage, the system of compulsory food on board the pilgrim ships was introduced in the year under review in accordance with amendments to the Indian Merchant Shipping Act. In this first year of experiment, several defects were apparent in the operation of the system, and vigorous protests and complaints were received from pilgrims arriving by each ship, as well as from the members of the Committees of 1 ilgi ims. Cases of hunger-strike, passive resistance and active opposition occurred in some ships. The Government of India were kept telegraphically informed, and it was ' suggested that certain remedial measures should be taken. Similai giievances were also aired in the homeward-bound ships, as was apparent fiom reports of the Committees of Pilgrims. His Majesty s Minister expressed his views on this question in a separate despatch to the Government of India of the 8th June last. Cb) The shipping company issued food tickets for both journeys on one sheet of paper, and many instances came to the notice of the Legation of the loss of these tickets. It appears from the experience gained this year that it would be preferable to issue separate single tickets for each journey. £ (c) The local shipping agents issued fresh tickets without food l on l1 tl ? e homeward-bound pilgrim ships, to persons travelling to Aden and Mo a. a . The question as to whether this is a contravention of the provisions of section 208 (B) (2) of the Act is under consideration. Amirs-al-Haj and Committees of Pilgrims. * • i tt • 140 (a) No provision was made for the appointment of an Amir-al-Haj, on any of the KSps of the year under review.. The attention ^ govern ment of TnHia was drawn to it in the Legations telegram reterred to in paraeraoh 139 (a) above All subsequent ships, commencing with the steamship M^rwhlh aVnved at Jedda on the 6th March, carried Amirs-al -Ha], or, in ^ (torre'uniCaJcs.ltwlirnsidered preferable to appoint for each.ship a ciltee of PUgrims; of from three to five members, instead of a singler c\J 24 Amir-al-Haj. Accordingly, committees were formed consisting of educated pilgrims travelling by each ship. Their reports as received here from the Bombay Port Haj Committee are useful documents, although somewhat overloaded with recommendations concerning matters beyond their competence (see paragraph 147 of last year's report). t Pilgrim Passes. 141 The new form of pilgrim pass, as amended by the Indian Pilgrim Ship Rules 1933, was introduced this year. Although Part II of it is necessary for the purpose of counterfoil in cases of ' deposit paid,' the Indian vice-consul suggests it is unnecessary in the case of return ticket holders. In handling, they proved bulky on being deposited with the return tickets for safe custody at this Legation. There were minor matters, e.g., the issue of type-written passes on flimsy paper, which will be taken up separately in due course. ii Refunds on Deposit Paid Passes. 142. The Indian Pilgrim Ship Rules, 1933, authorised this post to make refunds of deposits made by pilgrims in India forthwith, on receipt of applica tions. Subsequently, the Government, at the suggestion of this Legation, approved of the system of drawing the necessary amounts on any leading firms at Jedda; having correspondents in India, in return giving them drafts for the amounts drawn on the executive officer concerned, and issuing simultaneous notification, bearing the number of the draft, to that officer for his information. Registration. 143. The Legation arrangements continued to work satisfactorily, and 6,930 of the 7,399 Indian pilgrims shown in paragraph 34 as having arrived by sea registered at the Legation, the deficit being accounted for by pilgrims who evade the local dues, and by some of those who arrived by the last ship and hurried to Mecca. However, those who did not register here were detained for a few days so as to serve as a warning to them and to their wakils; eventually they were given the usual privilege of the ' rotation system ' in view of their poverty. 144. Sixty-eight unclaimed or unused return halves of tickets and deposit paid passes of 1933 were forwarded to the Commissioner of Police, Bombay. Applications received thereafter for refunds or return to India are being dealt with in accordance wth the instructions conveyed by the Government of India in their letter of the 27th April, 1933. 14o. Two Indian pilgrims who had not deposited their return tickets at this Legation and eleven foreign pilgrims reported the loss of their return tickets to this Legation. Arrangements similar to those described in paragraph 179 of 1932 report were made for all cases, to enable them to obtain passages. . ( l ues tion referred to in paragraph 153 of last year's report, of wmch a further example occurred this year, concerning the payment of loans from leiund amounts on the return tickets of debtors, was finally decided by the Government of India, that any refund should only be paid to the pilgrim himself, or to his nominee or legal representative. 147. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah states that he would again be grateful for the collaboration of the authorities in India (see paragraph 154 of last year 's repor t) to ensure accuracy in the compilation of the lists of pilgrims travelling to the Hejaz, to whom pilgrim passes are issued by the pilgrimage authorities in ndia. I his year the particulars have often been incomplete and inaccurate. Local Haj Committee. 148. The local Haj Committee, mentioned in paragraph 157 of last year's report, was again constituted as usual, under the presidency of the Indian vice- t J- P ur P ose o/ regulating return passages to India. It sat at the house ot the Indian vice-consul and did useful work. p , , The anangements for the Hyderabad Pilgrimasre were again satis- a^c o^f^i^s^ar, under the supervision of an experienced retired sessions judge, 1anl^ Assart;- '■COlSifr K it this ij ofj 150. There was again one stowaway this year from India. The Saudi M Government returned him by the same ship, without allowing him to perform the Haj. Destitutes. was ^ c 9 ns i ( ierable increase in the number of destitutes this year over 1933 the ngures being 560 as against 353 ; which may be accounted for in the mam by the tact that the number of those who came overland was greater in proportion to the total, being 531 this year as against 263 last year. The following tables give an analysis of the figure for this year by [a) provinces of origin, and (o) routes of access to the Hejaz ;— S post to' ipt0f| this 1« drafts I r j ii: {a) Provinces of origin- ang ara f pilgi j Bengal 130 Sind ... 208 Punjab 98 Beluchistan 24 North-West Frontier Province 17 United Provinces 19 Central Provinces 4 Delhi 3 Bombay 2 Madras 34 Assam 12 Burma 4 Ceylon 1 Hyderabad (Deccan) 3 Central India Agency ... 1 560 (6) Route— (1) Overland- [lallyfc :poTer|1 inii olice, ire fc int( ticbtsij retwf agrapHj jes, ir's Kff : of M Via Yemen Via Mokallah Via Nejd Via Goadhar Via Iraq Via Muscat Via Palestine (2) By sea— Bombay Karachi Calcutta 87 66 38 308 12 12 14 10 3 2 531 8 i of W inis — 29 560 152. The authorities in India were again able to get a quotation of 40 rupees per head, excluding food and conveyance charges, direct from Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co. for the repatriation of destitutes. A sum of 854 rupees was collected from twenty-six of the individuals repatriated, who seemed able to contribute, in part, to the cost of their return. The actual amount expended on behalf of the Government of India was 27,910 rupees. 153. The usual precautions were taken to guard against fraud, to provide the authorities in India with lists of the persons repatriated and to take from each an undertaking to repay the money expended. 154. The Government of India was asked in a despatch to devote further consideration to the measures necessary for the control of pilgrims travelling on foot overland. [10535] E26 Publicity. 1 ul 155. The Government of India, as usual, issued a further edition of the Guide for Pilgrims to the Hejaz, which contained information of the greatest utility to pilgrims. I §tra Banking Facilities. 156. There has been no change in the position described in previous reports. The principal banking concerns in Jedda are still the Netherlands Trading Society, which has branches in India, and Messrs. Gellatly Hankey and Co. whose correspondents there are the National Bank of India. The Legation again deprecates the use of ' Hundis.' y 157. Requests were again made by several leading pilgrims to make 1 arrangements to cash drafts and make payments at Mecca and Medina. The amount of cash deposited by the pilgrims, in the safe custody of this Legation, amounted to 30,233 rupees this year. Indian Staff. M Trfi 158. The staff of the Indian Section consisted of the Indian vice-consul and two permanent clerks, and was reinforced as usual during the pilgrimage season by the employment of three temporary clerks. All worked with their customary industry and efficiency. A change in personnel took place when the second clerk, Seyyid Ghulam Reza. reverted to his original post in India on account of ill- health. and Mr. Iqbal Din, B.A., of the North-West Frontier Secretariat, was seconded for service here. (11) A fghan Pilgrimage. - r ^ If ill 159. there was a notable fall in the number of Afghan pilgrims, bein? \ 1,720, as against 2,412 last year. ^ 160. 1 he majority of these pilgrims again travelled from India on return tickets or deposit-paid passes. There were very few destitutes amongst them, and these, as usual, were repatriated by local charity. i\/r^ ^ / j0 Y ernmen t detached their consul at Bombay for service 1 f i 1 ^ i during the pilgrimage season, as last year. This gentleman, Seyyid :&gt; tk A hrlnl T-Tnrmrl o t i ^ ^ ^ 0 « V . UI Abdul Hamid, arrived here on the 16th March, 1934, in the company of their 0 ? c ^' . Hashmy, an Indian. The former left for India on the '27th April 1934 During the period of his stay in the Hejaz, Seyyid Abdul amid discharged virtually no consular functions, although he presented his ^ ci edentials to Amir Feisal. He spent most of his time in a visit to Medina. r Hashmy carried out his medical duties for a very short period at Mecca, and left for India on the 5th April, 1934. Wi 162. The Afghan clerk, who was left in charge of work last year, is an A Th experienced man, and carried out the usual duties, having his office in the Afghan hostel at Mecca, ^o house was again rented this year for the consular office at Jedda and the consul lived as the guest of certain local personages. a Afghan Minister m Cairo, Sheikh Muhammad Sadiq Muiaddedi, ILo visited Medina. ^ reinamed in Mecc a during the Haj period. He - Althou g l1 0I | e 01 two persons of the pro-Amanullah party were present this y e eaT aZ ' n0 SPeCla aCtlvlty in furth erance of their cause came to notice (12) Malay Pilgrimage.

Selangor Negri Sembilan ... Pahang Unfederated Malay States— Johore ... Kedah ... Perlis ... Kelantan Trengganu Brunei ... Total 167. Although this number was more than 72 per cent, higher than that of last year, when the total number was 101, it was yet very far below normal; and if a comparison be instituted with the highest figure on record, viz., in 1927, when there was a total number of 12,173, it was a mere 1-42 per cent, of that number. Seyfi sit toll deeding on Board Ship. 168. This may be considered satisfactory, in that there were no complaints vpmi from pilgrims. This was borne too out by the Malay pilgrimage officer's personal observations during the journey from Singapore to Jedda, as a result of which he reports that the food was supplied according to his recommendations submitted in 1930. Charges and Cost of Pilgrimage. 169. The general nature and effects of the Saudi pilgrimage tariff are again discussed in a separate section of this report. The approximate rate of exchange this year was 24-| riyals = £1 gold = 14 Straits dollars on the average. 170. The following is an estimate of the minimum expenditure incurred this season by a Malay pilgrim from Malaya and back to Malaya (reference paragraph 178 of last year's report). It depends on a diversity of factors, and must be accepted as an approximation only :— ist)® in tie QSlllrf iqjfcf ij prf (1) (2) IDui'' (3) td# &lt; J V 1 Visit to Mecca only.

The prices of food-stuffs and water were reasonable, Haii Abdul i reports, except during the height of the season (Haj days and one or two weeks ^ )le I^ 0US w prices leaped up by about 50 per cent., and water, particularly at Muna, went up to about 5 to 10 qurush per tin of 4 srallons (where 1 oirsh equals about 3 cents). 172. Security to pilgrims was maintained by the Saudi Arab Government throughout the season, though petty thefts, owing to the great poverty prevailing in the country, were reported to have occurred.29 173. The hotels established in Mecca, Medina and Jedda bv the Saudi Government were again not patronised by Malay pilgrims. Haii Abdul Mai id attributes this to the greater solicitude of Malay mutawwifs, as compared with the mutawwifs of other nationalities, for the comfort, accommodation and well-being of their charges. Assistance to Pilgrims. 174. As usual, much of the assistance given to pilgrims was of a pecuniary nature. Six destitute persons were repatriated and two others were given small sums as maintenance. They all signed undertakings to refund the sums expended on them icspectively. At the same time efforts were made to impress upon the pilgrims that the assistance promised to them in their pilgrim passes does not include pecuniary assistance, and the Malay Pilgrimage Officer would bespeak the co-operation of the Grovernment of Kelantan in impressing this point upon would-be pilgrims before they undertake the journey. Pilgrims with Single Tickets. 175. Of the 173 registered pilgrims this season, as many as twenty-two of them came on single tickets, or more than 12 per cent. Considering the fact that both extension of validity of the return portions of these tickets up to five years, as well as refunds on those not used within those five years are now available (thanks to the generosity of the Blue Funnel Line), Haji Abdul Majid is of the opinion that Government authority to purchase single tickets by intending pilgrims should be withheld, except to persons of Saudi Arab nationality who are returning to their own country. The Issue of Pilgrim Passes. 176. A few cases of persons of Siamese or Dutch-Javanese nationalities were discovered who, according to their pilgrim passes, were described as 'British subjects' or 'British-protected persons.' It is felt that it is unnecessary to do more than mention this in order to ensure that officers issuing pilgrim passes adopt somewhat stricter measures in determining the nationality of pilgrims for insertion in their pilgrim passes. Medical Aid to Malay Pilgrims. 177. Commencing with the pilgrimage season under review, the method of computing the cost of the medical treatment of pilgrims from British Malaya has been changed. At the suggestion of the Government of Netherlands India, whose medical officer in the Hejaz is charged with the duty of looking after the health of British Malays as well as his own subjects, the basis upon which a charge for medical stores is made was changed to a flat-rate charge of 1 florin per pilgrim. Formerly, the charge was determined by the proportion of British Malay pilgrims to the total of Dutch-Javanese and Malay pilgrims. The new system appears to have been introduced without any limitation of time. The monthly allowance to the Javanese doctor will continue in addition. Mortality. 178. During the season under review there were four deaths, reported by the accompanying relatives of the deceased, up to the time the Malay pilgi image officer left Jedda on the 3rd May. This was less than 2^ per cent, of the number of arrivals this season. Although this percentage of death was higher than that of last year (1 per cent.), it could scarcely be considered as abnormal, as during the last ten years there have been seasons when the rate has been as high as 15 per cent. Effects of Deceased Pilgrims. • i i 179. The British Legation at Jedda is still in correspondence with the Saudi Arab Government over the effects of two deceased pilgrims. Other enquiries were again successfully liquidated. [10535] F30 Staff. J m W ^ 180. Haji Abdul Majid, the Malay pilgrimage officer, arrived at Jedda on the 21st November, 1933, and Haji Muhammad Jamil assisted him as clerk from ' the 21st November, 1933, to the 25th December, 1933, and then from the 2nd April 1934, to the 3rd May, 1934. His work was satisfactory, as usual. Haii Ahdni Majid left again for Malaya on the 3rd May, 1934. (13) West African Pilgrimage. 181. According to the Saudi returns (see paragraph 34), 891 West Africans P ^ came on pilgrimage this year via Suakin and Jedda as against 509 in 1933. The i 10 ® Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that, in addition, a further 0^ 1,259 West Africans of all nationalities reached Saudi Arabia through the smaller ports south of Jedda by dhow from Massawa. This is the first time that the Saudi authorities have ventured on an estimate of the figure for these clandestine arrivals, though this Legation has reason to believe that 1,259 is, if anything, an under-estimation. In any case, they are thought not to have exceeded a total of 1,600 souls. Certain signs have been detected which would appear to point to a diminution in dhow traffic via Massawa, but it is still much too early to establish this with certainty, as the recent Saudi-Yemen war must have considerably restricted, during the past year, the normal flow of overland pilgrims to Asiri ports. The Saudi authorities also are now betraying a somewhat livelier consciousness of a traffic which unloads on this country an unprofitable and burdensome type of pilgrim, and are reported to have turned back a number of dhows entering their southern ports from Massawa. 182. The suggestion that the facts relating to the question of dhow traffic \ia Massawa be ventilated in the International Elealth Office (see paragraph 193 of last year s report) was adopted, with the result that the Government of Eritrea have, it is understood, received instructions from the Italian Government of t in this respect. It is to be hoped that all West Africans on transiting the port a of Massawa en route for the eastern littoral of the Red Sea will be dealt with, in I, futuie, in accordance with the provisions of the International Sanitary Conven- tion of 1926. It may be possible to present a more considered statement regarding (fl). the piesent extent of the dhow traffic via Massawa after the 1935 pilgrimage (^) season, when the factors mentioned above may be more accurately assessed, (c). 183. The Nigerian Pilgrimage Scheme (see paragraph 192 of last year's report) was successfully initiated this year. Sixty-nine Nigerians took out the new form of pilgrim pass in Maiduguri and all reached Jedda before pilgrimage day At the date of writing this report (30th June, 1934) all but four have eit tor their home, via Suakin, after collecting their return tickets and the sum 1®. Ai or subsistence due to them in Jedda.

As foreshadowed in paragraph 195 of last year s report, an urgent pro bleni con front s this Legation regarding the disposal of a large number of t - aa o -nn St f ^ varying, according to different estimates, from ' -ApOO souls. The great majority of these have come on pilgrimage in ows vm Massawa, in recent years and are now destitute in this country owing, (a) to the tact that the demand for West African labour has decreased; [h) to the a resu ^ ( a ) there is a marked increase in mendicancy, which has led the baudi Government to enforce measures to rid the Holy Places of mendicants | ot whatever nationality; and (c) that the African village outside the walls of Wd e da was ravaged by fire on the 5th April last and several hundred British West li| t Atncans rendered homeless. The situation, which as far as the fire-victims were concerned soon became less urgent, remained serious at the end of the period under review and was fully reported to His Majesty's Government and other British authorities concerned. In addition, the new Italian Charge d'Affaires in Jedda NN.is placed m full possession of all the facts of the case. It was suggested to him that VV est Africans w^ho had come here via Massawa should return the same ai J d ^at the Entrean Government should afford facilities, as they did in Vu ' 0I \, e ' r return journey.

Acc ?. r 4 in 8 to the Saudi returns (see paragraph 34), fifty-two Somalis lifc ; of all nationalities entered this country via the port of Jedda this year, as compared with seventy-nve last year. As far as can be judged, not more than twenty Somalis from the British ^omaliland Protectorate and a lesser number from Aden are included in the figure of fifty-two. It is thought that fewer Somalis than usual came on pilgrimage overland this year owing to the Saudi- • 1; Yemen war, which seriously restricted free access to the Holv Land through the southern ports. 188. Nine Somali ratings of the sloop H.M.S. Penzance, on a visit to Jedda during Haj week, made the pilgrimage this year. 189. The system governing the repatriation of Somali destitutes was, in consultation with the Government of Somaliland, readjusted this year. It had been decided early last year (see paragraph 199 of last year's report) to repatriate able-bodied Somali destitutes by dhow and the aged and sick by steamship, but, it was found later in the year that owing to a variety of circumstances few of the Somalis repatriated by dhow reached their homes. Accordingly, all Somali destitutes were repatriated by steamship this year via Aden, and it is hoped that this procedure will be continued in future years. 190. The only advance made this year to a Somali was to the tribal chief (Garad) of the Eyal Warsengeri, who ran short of funds on his return from Mecca. 191.

According to the Saudi returns (see paragraph 34), 534 Sudanese pilgrims entered the port of Jedda from Suakin this year in ships of the Khedivial Mail Line, as compared with 420 last year. 193. Fears that pilgrims from villages in the Sudan would again erroneously render themselves liable to increased Saudi dues, as described in paragraph 203 of last year's report, proved groundless. Only two cases came to the attention of the Legation. It should be stated in this connexion that certain holders of Suakin pilgrim passes were simply described as being ' Min Ahali Essudan '— a rather vague description of domicile. This description tended to create a suspicion in the minds of the Saudi authorities that the holders of such pilgrim passes were natives of towns of the Sudan and that this general description of domicile was an attempt on the part of the holders to evade the payment of the higher dues. 194. Forty-nine Sudanese pilgrims were advanced a total of £131 12s. 2d. in the return season to enable them (a) to settle their mutawwif's dues; (5) repay loans contracted whilst on pilgrimage; and (c) to subsist while awaiting a home- bound ship. The individual sums advanced this year were unusually high as several applicants for relief represented large families. 195. Owing to the fact that the Khedivial Mail Line has, as usual, to serve pilgrims of all nationalities, there was the usual shortage of ships at various periods in the return season. Various Sudanese delegations visited the Legation (see section 13 paragraph 2, of the report for 1929) to protest against the ship shortage They were informed that they must take their turn with the pilgrims of other nationalities Mr. A. S. Redfern, the Commissioner of Port Sudai?- who32 was on a visit to Jedda, during one of these periods of shortage, was informed of the position. 196.

The Saudi returns (see paragraph 34) show that twenty -seven Zanzibar! and East African pilgrims entered the port of Jedda this year on pilgrimage as against one last year (in this connexion, see paragraph 207 of last year's report). Several of these pilgrims were in possession of pilgrim passes 198. The Indian chauffeur mentioned in paragraph 208 of last year's report has at last been released by the Saudi authorities following the repeated repre sentations of this Legation. Nothing further has been heard from the attorney who abandoned his claim for blood money last year. 199. No Zanzibari or East African pilgrim applied for repatriation this year.

In the return season a number who wished to return home via India booked passages on an Italian steamer bound for Bombay. On boarding the ship on its arrival m Jedda they were told that the commander of the ship in view of certain shaping technicalities was unable to take them as passengers,'whereupon above) peri:orce to return t( &gt; the shore and await a later ship (see paragraph 129 202.

According to the Saudi returns (see paragraph 34) 267 Adenese and natives of the Aden Protectorate (including Hadhramis) came on pilgrimage this year, and entered Saudi Arabia via the ports of Yanbu, Jedda and Lith. The Saudis have not this year differentiated between the Adenese, thirty-one of whom came on pilgrimage in 1933, and the Hadhramis, who numbered 273. 208. The Adenese and natives of the Aden Protectorate (reference para graph 218 of last year's report), had adequate shipping facilities in the return season. The Besse steamers ran to schedule, even if the date of their impending arrival was usually shrouded in mystery. 209. Fewer Hadhramis than ever of the semi-settled class applied to this Legation for travel papers to return home after the return season (see paragraph 223 of last year's report). At the date of writing this report (30th June, 1934), fewer than 270 applications have been received. Economic conditions have again seriously affected them. Owing to the prevailing financial stringency few have been able to recover outstanding debts due to them, while a number who work as domestic servants have not even been paid their wages for the past year. 210.

According to the Saudi returns (see paragraph 34), which do not this year differentiate between pilgrims hailing from the sheikhdoms, &amp;c., of the Arabian shores of the Persian Gulf, seventy-nine Muscatis, Bahreinis and Koweitis entered the port of Jedda on pilgrimage this year, while in 1933 the Saudi returns showed that eleven Muscatis and 179 Bahreinis arrived in this country on pilgrimage through the port of Jedda. Among notable pilgrims from Muscat this year was the ex-Sultan, his Highness Timur-bin-Feisal. 212. There is no doubt at all that a much larger number came on pilgrimage overland via Nejd, but there are no Saudi statistics available of this, nor can this Legation venture to estimate a figure. 213. No Muscati, Bahreini or Koweiti pilgrim applied for repatriation this year. (21) The Sarawak Pilgrimage. 214.

Each Government is now to appoint a commission to decide on the alignment of the projected motor road. 2. Elsewhere in the same issue of the Umm-al-Qura it is reported that a motor transport company has been formed for the purpose of transporting pilgrims from the Persian Gulf by car to Mecca. This development, which is stated to have been sponsored by the Saudi Government as a result of representa tions received from ' inhabitants of the Persian Gulf,' may be not unconnected with the proposals of the Saudi authorities to develop the carriage of mails by car, reported in my despatch No. 319 of the 20th October, as this company is to transport mails as well as passengers. The company, it is stated, intends to commence its operations before Ramadan. 3.

I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the usual annual report on the pilgrimage to the Holy Places of the Hejaz in 1935. It has been prepared on the same lines as the report for 1934, enclosed with my despatch No. 254 of the 11th August, 1934. 2. It gives me pleasure to place on record once again my appreciation of the excellent worik of the pilgrimage officers of the Legation and of their conscien tious and exhaustive reports, from which this general survey has been compiled. The experience and wide knowledge of Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, the Indian vice-consul, have proved very valuable, whilst Haji Abdul Majid, the Malay pilgrimage officer, Dr. Abdul Hamid, the Indian medical officer and Mr. C. Ousman, pro-consul, whose first year of pilgrimage work this is, have made useful contributions and deserve my thanks. I am indebted to their respective staffs, in particular to Shah Jehan-al-Kabir, principal assistant to the Indian vice-consul, for much laborious work undertaken in typing this report. 3. As in the past two years, copies of this despatch and enclosure are again being sent only to the Government of India (Foreign and Political Department), the Government of India (Department of Education, Health and Lands) and the Government of the Straits Settlements.

It is agreeable to be able to record in the compass of a few lines that Saudi Arabia, since the last report was rendered, has passed a year relatively unvexe by serious disturbance, internal or external. Withm her own borders peace and security have remained unbroken, and with her neighbours her relations hav been uniformly correct, and, with Iraq in particular, fuendly. e rea y [12098] B2 Taif spirit of Arab brotherhood with the Yemen was severely tested by the attempted assassination in the Haram at Mecca ot Ibn &gt;aud and Amir Saud by a number of Yemenis, to which reference will be made later, but, thanks to the good sense of the King, survived substantially unimpaired. 2. Considerable diplomatic activity marked the course of the year over a large field of questions in which British interests were closely involved and protracted negotiations with the Saudi authorities on a number of delicate subjects, chiefly relating to eastern and south-eastern frontiers, engaged the attention of the Legation. The future of the Treaty of Jedda, which had become denunciable by either party at six months' notice at any time from the 17th March, 1934. onwards, was also the subject of conversations. These negotiations were to be continued in London in June and July 1935, when Fuad Bey Llamza would be there in attendance on the Amir Saud, who embarked at Jedda for Italy on the 14th May, on his first visit to Europe. 3. The year was more definitely given over to internal reorganisation, consolidation of recently acquired territory, and to liquidation, as far as possible, of the financial legacy of the Yemen war. In the autumn of 1934, upon the demobilisation of his troops, Ibn Saud disbursed in cash and kind the equivalent, it is estimated, of at least £100,000 gold, in war gratuities. Conjecture as to the provenance of so considerable a sum leaned to the view that the King had dipped heavily into the Royal Treasury, a reservoir of unknown depths, little credence being given to the opinion, strongly held in one quarter, that Ibn Saud, as a condition of peace with the Yemen, had exacted a secret indemnity from the Imam Yahya. 4. Release from his preoccupations as Deputy Minister for Defence enabled Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, in his other capacity of Minister of Finance, to devote his undivided attention to the revenues of the country. Measures were taken, by an intensification of propaganda work in Islamic countries, to stimulate an increased pilgrimage for 1935, and promises, not to be fulfilled, were held out of a ' Haj-al-Akbar,' with its seven-fold blessings. A propaganda department was established in the Ministry of Finance under the notorious Indian agitator, Muhammad Khan Ghazi Khan. 5. Partly perhaps as a 'consequence of these efforts, the total of overseas pilgrims in 1935 rose to 33,898, a satisfactory increase over the 25,291 of the previous year and better, in fact, than the figures for any year since 1931. 6. Pilgrimage Day, the 9th Dhu'l Hijja, fell this year on Thursday, the 14th March, a keen disappointment to many who had hoped for a Friday Haj, Haj-al-Akbar.'' The congregation on Arafat numbered some 70,000 inclusive of all elements, according to Legation estimates, although the Saudi estimate, higher as usual, put it at about 100,000, Nejdis alone being estimated at about 40,000. The increase this year, apart from the general increase from abroad, can be chiefly attributed to the presence of Yemenis, who numbered about 10,000, whilst the Indian vice-consul reports that again this year Hejazis were not represented in full force, owing to the adverse effects of the economic depression. 7. Climatic conditions, if warm, were favourable and general health was good. Saudi medical personnel (vide paragraph 58) remained much the same as last year. 8. The outstanding incident of the pilgrimage was the attempt, happily completely frustrated, of a number of Yemenis to assassinate the King and the Heir Apparent. The would-be murderers attacked the King and his son whilst they were circumambulating the Kaaba, but were beaten off and speedily dealt with. The King showed exemplary coolness and his sagacity and statesmanship in giving strict instructions that the persons of the numerous Yemeni ' Guests of God '' then at Mecca were to be respected averted what might easily have proved to be another St. Bartholomew's Eve. 9. The economic situation was depicted in last year's report (paragraph 9 et seq.) in the most sombre colours. During the intervening twelve months, although some improvement has been discernible, particularly in 1935, the general position has continued to present many of the unsatisfactory features previously noticed. A further payment of £30,000 gold by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company early in the summer of 1934 scarcely availed to lighten the burden of expenditure over the Yemen war. Economy was again practised at the expense of officials, whose salaries, when paid, were invariably considerably in arrear, whilst the most recent step has been to effect an all-round salary reduction of,1 u- 3 25 per cent., two-thirds of the balance to be paid in cash and one-third in kind, the cash payment to be reckoned in terms of gold at a highly unfavourable rate. Distress was scarcely less intense and afflicted most classes in the Hejaz, including merchants, motoi-cai owners and mutawwifs. Trade continued on a restricted scale and goods left over from last year clogged the market, yet a slight improve ment in movement and clearances through customs was reported. Up to the end of 1934, few signs of a change for the better were apparent, though, as has been noted, Ibn Saud was able to meet expenditure on war gratuities and the Saudi Government were able on the whole to discharge current liabilities as they fell due. The larger pilgrimage brought a welcome increase to the revenues, and although the poverty of the average pilgrim was no less marked than before, an unusually large number of distinguished personages and well-to-do pilgrims was an appreciable factor. Customs receipts probably improved in consequence, with the result that a serious situation was sensibly eased and a somewhat better tone observed. Certain firms here were understood to have completed a satisfactory | year, and Sharqieh Limited concluded the season with a profit, albeit only ' perhaps a 'paper' one. A signal instance of a return to financial rectitude (or perhaps a desire to please) was the payment by the Saudi Government in May 1935 of the whole of one small debt due to His Majesty's Government and 10 per cent, of a larger one due to His Majesty's Government and the Government of India. 10. While the California Arabian Standard Oil Company have made some progress in their rather remote operations in Hasa, the schemes referred to in paragraph 11 of last year's report have had a somewhat various history :— (a) Mr. Philby was able to secure in 1934 renewal of the motor-vehicle concession to Sharqieh Limited on more favourable terms, and it was understood, subsequent to the pilgrimage, that a substantial profit, on paper, had been realised. Mr. Philby was, however, still dissatisfied with the working arrangements of the new concession, in some respects. (b) The Hyderabad textile scheme in Medina continued to confine its sphere of usefulness to the support of the manager and his family, but of no one and nothing else. (c) No further developments in respect of Messrs. Ibrahim Jewan Baksh and the Mecca public electricity supply scheme were reported. 11. Further economic projects initiated during the year may be briefly noticed :— (a) A concession over a large area of the Hejaz, excluding the holy areas of Mecca and Medina, was granted in the autumn of 1934 to the Saudi Arabia Mining Syndicate for the exploitation of gold. Mr. K. S. Twitchell, the syndicate's representative in this country, started work early in 1935 and was stated to be optimistic, at the end of the period under review. The syndicate certainly has provided work at the site of its present operations south-east of Medina for a fair number of necessitous Bedouin. (b) A piastre project, or the collection of piastres from the public for objects of a national character, on the lines of a movement started in Egypt, was inaugurated in May 1935. Its objects are at present nebulous, but, it is thought, will be connected with a scheme to provide Saudi Arabia with an air force. It was not regarded as a vigorous movement at its inception. (c) A concession was given in the summer of 1934 to Sheikh Abdurrahman Quseybi to fish for pearls in the Eed Sea waters of Saudi Arabia. Venezuelan divers under a Syrian overseer spent several unsuccessful months both north and south of Jedda, but operations were suspended and have not since been resumed. 12. Medina has undoubtedly suffered greater privation and misery of late years than other centres in the Hejaz, and that much sympathetic interest in her unhappy situation has been evinced throughout the Islamic woi Id the following will bear witness ; — (a) The Eg-vptian Government sent 38,000 sacks of wheat and a considerable sum of money for distribution to the poor of Medina. Only about one-sixth of the wheat is reported to have reached its destination, the [12098] B 2 n$dremainder lying, rapidly deteriorating, at Yanbu. The Egyptian consulate have received little satisfaction in response to their represen tations to the Minister of Finance, who had undertaken to transport the whole consignment from Yanbu to Medina in twenty days. (b) The Nawab of Bahawalpur visited Medina and remained there a month, much to the advantage of the commerce and charitable institutions of the place. (c) A movement has been launched in India for the establishment of a charitable dispensary at Medina. One individual donation of 25,000 rupees was reported. 13. In May 1935 the Government imported from India 400,000 rupees in silver stated to be for payments due to be made by Ibn Saud in Nejd. It was understood that this had been necessitated by a general reluctance in Nejd to accept Saudi rials, and dissatisfaction with the hitherto much used Maria Theresa dollar as currency. 14. Greater interest has been evinced in the air and an aerial society was inaugurated during the year. The Government also sent a number of students to Italy to be trained as aviators. The question of pilgrimage by air came to the fore last year owing to the activities of Talaat Pasha Harb and the Banque Misr group. Although they were unable to get permission of the Saudi Government this year for an air service, it was understood there was a fair chance of it being granted in 1936. 15. The general desire of the Saudi Government to promote appeasement was demonstrated by the grant, during the year, of an amnesty to Saudis living abroad who had been engaged in the past in anti-Saudi activities. As a result, a number of exiles returned and made their peace with Ibn Saud. 16. Propaganda (see paragraph 12 of last year's report) did not abate perceptibly and the same leading practitioners were in evidence. Jemal Pasha was less \ocal in India, but is alleged to have held out prospects of concessions for an India—Hejaz air service to certain credulous persons, who were gracefully eluded by the pasha, when both he and they came on pilgrimage. Dr. Shafi Ahmed, Ph.D., turned up and was said to have been rewarded for past, and encouraged for future, services. Ismail Ghuznavi arrived on Haj, after two years absence, and was stated to have had his funds replenished. 17- As has been noted, the Minister of Finance gave himself up largely to the pilgrimage this year and excelled himself in his attentions to distinguished, well-to-do and influential pilgrims. His entertainments were more numerous and more lavish cars were placed at the disposal of those he wished to cultivate and cei tain Koshan exemptions were granted. This generous ground-baiting for next year s pilgrimage culminated in the circulation amongst returning pilgrims by the Haj Committee of a leaflet announcing the forthcoming reduction of the Pilgrim Tariff for 1936 by 25 per cent., a matter concerning which the Legation await more official confirmation. ^•ii ^ c ^ ail ^ e took place in Saudi-Egyptian relations and there was still no likelihood of the mahmal being sent to this country, but there were evidences of greater cordiality in their actual relations. Talaat Pasha Harb, chairman of directors of the Banque Misr, again visited the Hejaz by air several months beioie the Haj, this time accompanied by Adly Yeghen Pasha a fellow- director^ The number of Egyptian pilgrims further' increased from 4,302 last year to 5,361 this, all of whom, many being well-to-do, travelled by the steamship Zamzam and steamship El Kawsar, acquired by the Banque Misr Navigation Company for this purpose. The company also provided two large barges for the conveyance of pilgrims between ship and shore, but this innovation was not a success, ialaat Pasha performed the opening ceremony of the hotels at Mecca and Jedda, inaugurated under the auspices of the Banque Misr 19 There were certain signs during the year that Ibn Saud might adopt a more liberal attitude towards the question of non-Moslem foreign representatives vi^tmg rau. Hopes were encouraged by his spectacular gesture in inviting His Majesty s Minister to visit him there in July 1934, before proceeding on ve^ Sir Andrew Ryan s visit lasted from the 12th to the 14th July, ui ^ j The Mecca newspaper the Umm-al-Qura of the 21st September, 1934, published an official communique 'approving' the International Sanitary Con vention ot 1926, with the exception of the following articles : 7, 55, 75, 127, 135,136, 137, 138, 140, 142, 144, 145, 147, 148, 150, 151, 163, 164, 165. It transpired that the baudi Government s intention was to adopt the convention, to which they were already signatories, with the exception of the articles indicated, for domestic legislative purposes only {vide paragraph 53 below). This enactment was one item only m a spate of otficial legislation or quasi-legislation among which may be mentioned the Infectious Diseases Regulations, Narcotic Drugs Regulations and Regulations in regard to Vaccination. 21. A definite tendency was observed this year for agitators to exploit the pilgrimage as a platform from which to ventilate their political grievances in the dissemination of anti-Jewish and other political literature. This was particu larly the case in regard to Palestinian Arabs, and Sir Andrew Ryan took an opportunity of alluding to the matter in conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza soon after the pilgrimage. The conversation related to the proposed despatch of an unofficial Saudi mission to India and Palestine in connexion with the Harameyn . Waqfs. A so-called delegation from Syria, consisting of Dr. Jamil Mardam, I Fakhri Bey Barudi, and Shafiq Bey Jabri, arrived, via Bagdad and the overland route, from Nejef. 22. Besides the hotels of the Banque Misr, those of the Government (see paragraph 14 of last year's report), which were still maintained, were well patronised and were fully booked. The number of pilgrims who used the Medina Hotel was again insignificant. The Government rest-houses on the roads were seldom used by pilgrims, on account of their excessive charges. The scheme of Sir Nizamat Jung to construct caravanserais on the Medina road still remained on paper, and no further developments were noticed in this respect during the year under review. The Government again maintained a service of spare motor lorries, engineers and spare parts, for the assistance of motor traffic on the Medina road, which proved of assistance to pilgrims. A posse of Nejdi soldiers was also posted in the more difficult and sandy parts on the Mecca road to assist motor vehicles stuck in the sand. They, however, proved more of a nuisance than a help, as, on occasion, they were wont to beat chauffeurs for no apparent reason, until brought to heel by the authorities as the result of verbal represen tations of the Indian vice-consul. The Hejaz motor transport companies provided less secure conveyance this year. A number of regrettable accidents occurred; in one case, two Indian women pilgrims died of burns and others were injured on a bus catching fire; in another, an Indian woman pilgrim was run over by a bus, with fatal results. Many vehicles overturned, due to reckless driving and excessive speed, and their occupants were bruised in consequence. 23. Negotiations between the Saudi and Iraqi Governments for the establishment of an overland route between Nejef and Medina were amicably concluded during the year under review. The route was opened to motor traffic between the Hejaz and Iraq and, although many difficulties were experienced, a number of vehicles, carrying 398 pilgrims, arrived in time for the pilgrimage. Details, as also of other overland routes, will be found in the section on transport. 24. The orphanage at Medina (paragraph 15 of 1934 report) maintained its reputation and worked satisfactorily. The Director-General of the Saudi Police Force at Mecca inaugurated a scheme to deal with the increasing nuisance of mendicants within the precincts of the Holy Haram at Mecca. He opened a 'poor house,' and forcibly removed about 300 beggars from the Haram and i accommodated them therein. After the Haj they were freed agaim Well-to-do pilgrims contributed towards a fund opened for the purpose. This Legation also helped to reduce this problem by repatriating no less than 1,491 West African destitutes, via Suakin and Massawa. , ^ . . „ 25. Of the two small steamers of the Arabian Steam Navigation Company mentioned in paragraph 16 of last year's report, one, since hei anival from Hudeyda after the Yemen war, was sent to Egypt for repairs, and has not reappeared. The other lies at anchor in the Jedda Roads for longish periods, m between bursts of activity. 26 Pilgrimage shipping continued much on the same lines as m previous seasons, except that certain new ships appeared, cutting into the pilgrimage trade. French interests appear to have undergone reorganisation in the formation ot a company to run the Fabre Line steamship Sinma. Other newcomers were the French 'steamship Arafat, on the return pilgrimage, and the Velho of Messrs. Cowajee Dinshaw.27. The rial remained fairly steady this year. It fluctuated between 23 rials, and at the height of the Haj, 20 rials to the gold pound, but later appreciated to 15 rials for a variety of reasons, which are not altogethei cleai. 28. Prices of food-stuft's in rials remained about the same as last year, and the general purchasing power of pilgrims was still very low. I he Jedda munici- pality opened a stall, after the Haj, for the sale of food-stuffs to the public at standard prices. . . .. • i • i ^ j j 29. Security on the roads was again maintained at its high standard. Oases of pilferage again occurred at Mecca, Arafat, Mina and Muzdalfa. A lemaikable feat of daring was reported of three unarmed Hejazi Bedouin camelmen who killed two armed Nejdi soldiers, on patrol near laif. 30. The King, as usual gave his annual pilgrimage dinner on the 11th March. Unlike last year, the Indian vice-consul was invited, but was prevented from leaving Jedda by pressure of work in connexion with incoming pilgrims. The only foreign representative present was the Afghan Minister in Cairo, who also represents his government at the court of Ibn Sand. Among the speakers, the ex-King Amanuliah of Afghanistan caused much comment, for having spoken on the importance of Islamic unity, attempted twice to approach some further topic (thought to be slavery), but at the repeated gesture of appeal of Ibn Sand, desisted. The Royal discourse was, as usual, chiefly devoted to the necessity of co-operation among Moslem Powers, and concluded with an appeal for help to the Islamic world. 31. As a result of a private visit to Medina, in the autumn of 1934, the Indian vice-consul resported the desirability of certain reforms in the condition of the pilgrimage, both in the city itself and on the Medina road. No opportunity, however, presented itself of pursuing the matter. 32. The pilgrimage this year was attended by an unprecedented number of highly-placed Indian personages. Among them were— His Highness the Nawab of Bahawalpur, with a large suite and an elaborate train of motor cars; and her Exalted Highness the Badhsha-Begum of Hyderabad, representing the Ruling Princes and Princesses of India; Major-General Nawab Sir Omar Hayat Khan Tiwana, hon. A.D.C. to His Imperial Majesty; Nawab Bahadur Dr. Sir Muzamilullah Khan, K.C .I .E., O.B.E., Ll.D., of Aligarh; Nawab Wali-un-Dowlah Bahadur of Hyderabad (Deccan), who died at Medina of pneumonia; Nawab Sir Nizamat Jung Bahadur of Hyderabad (Deccan); Lady Waqalat-ul-Umra. step-mother of the Nizam; Khan Bahadur Hafiz Hidayet Husseyn, C .I .E., M .L .C., of Cawnpore. and Khan Bahadur Allama Yusuf Ali, C.B.E., I.C.S. (retired). Besides these there was also a large number of other high Government officials, non-officials, intellectuals and tribal chiefs of the North-West Frontier. 33. In addition, other distinguished pilgrims this year were ex-King Amanuliah of Afghanistan, the Glaoui, representative of Moroccan Grand Kaids, who came and went unostentatiously, Sheikh Muhammad-bin-Saqar, brother of the Ruler of Sharjah, and Sheikh Juma'-bin-Makhtum, brother of the Ruler of Dibai, and the chief of the Hadendown tribe of the Sudan, while conspicuous among pilgrims of many nationalities were four Japanese Moslems, who success fully performed the Haj. One English Moslem lady from Egypt, a Miss Wentworth Fitzwilliam, also made the pilgrimage. 34. Apart from Hasrat Mohani (paragraph 26 of 1934 report), Azad Sobhani, Moin L'ddin of Ajmere, Abdur Rahim of Peshawar, Mufti Muhammad Nasem of Ludhiana and Ismail Ghuznavi were the only Indian agitators to perform the pilgrimage this year. Muhammad Khan Ghazi Khan, mentioned in paragraph 26 of last year's report, succeeded in getting employment in the Saudi Ministry of Finance, in the capacity of the Superintendent' of the Pilgrimage Propaganda Bureau. 35. Arrangements for the dispersal of the pilgrimage worked satisfactorily this year. No compensation was payable by the shipping company to the pilgrims for detention at Jedda, as the ships for return journev were available within the prescribed time. 36. H.M.S. Penzance (Commander R. H. Bevan, R.N.) visited Jedda for Haj week. She stayed from the 12th March to the 17th March w7 37. A parade of Saudi troops at Mecca was held on the 20th March. The number of the troops reviewed, according to the Saudis, was 30,000. 38. No report of forged rupee notes came to the notice of this Legation during this season. The position in respect of forged rupee notes remains unchanged from that described in paragraph 25 of the 1933 report. 39. This year the Afghan Minister in Egypt was also appointed to represent Ju's government at the court of Ibn Sand, and visited the Hejaz during the pilgrimage. He rented a house this year for the Legation at Jedda, and although it remained practically closed upon the departure of the clerk in charge (the solitary remaining member of the Legation) on leave, its flag continued to fly on Fridays. An Indian doctor in the employment of the Afghan Government also performed the Haj. 40. Considerable anxiety was still felt by foreign residents in this country due to the attitude of the Saudi Arab Government towards them. They were deprived of several concessions in respect of ' Koshan,' &amp;c., which had been previously enjoyed alike with the Saudi subjects. Laws prohibiting foreigners from holding landed property in the Hejaz were revived, and pressure was brought to bear upon owners of property either to sell or to retain them by adopting Saudi nationality. The Indian chauffeurs were again allowed to work here for the pilgrimage season only. Certain exchanges took place between the Legation and the Saudi Arab Government over the question of Saudi nationality. Eventually an extension of time was granted by the Saudis for claimants to foreign nationality to produce their proofs. 41. As last year, the ' Kiswa ' or the Holy Cover for the Kaaba was woven locally through the joint efforts of the Hejazis and domiciled Indians, resulting in less expenditure, as last year. 42. No case of enslavement of pilgrims came to the notice of this Legation during this season, as last year. (2) Statistics. 43. The following tables give the usual statistical information. The figuies given are those prepared by the quarantine authorities, but it should again be pointed out that discrepancies occur between these figures and those supp ie from other sources. Besides the particulars of arrivals (by dhow) at l.itn (paragraph 34 of last year 's report), it has also been possible this year 0 a ^ further column in Table (A), showing the number of arrivals (by dhow) at Qunfida. The official figures given below represent therefore the total number of pilgrims who landed at Jedda, Yanbu, Lith and Qunfida, during e P the 31st October, 1934, to the 14th March, 1935, viz., 33,898 as against 25,291 for 1934.

No such measures are known to have been taken in respect of pilgrims travelling from Koweit, and no dues, it is understood, were levied. _ • t j 45. The usual quarantine measures were instituted at Kamaran, ior and Suakin during the year under review. Kamaran. 46. Compulsory vaccination and inoculation again gave satisfactory results. Kamaran reported health good. Ten deaths (five on British Indian ships) and four births (none on British Indian ships) were reported. Ihe steamship A kbar, on the 11th February, brought one case of modified small-pox and one of chicken- pox; the steamship Rahmaiii brought one case of measles, diagnosed at Kamaran as non-infectious; and the Akhar, on the 11th March, again brought a case of modified small-pox. 47. Exemption from landing pilgrims was granted to twenty-three ships, and only 268 pilgrims were landed for disinfection, compared with 282 last year, none of these being from British Indian ports. 48. The steamship Khosrou, calling at Aden on the 22nd February, took on board a few unvaccinated and uninoculated pilgrims. Fortunately, they readily submitted to vaccination and inoculation, and so the ship was not unduly delayed at Kamaran. Stricter precautions are to be taken at Aden for the future. 49. In view of the declaration of the Saudi medical authorities, verified by the Indian medical officer and the representative of the International Quarantine Board, that the pilgrimage was clean, His Majesty's Minister was able to dispense ships returning to India and Malaya from calling at Kamaran. Similar precautions to last year were observed regarding vaccination and inoculation of returning pilgrims, modified somewhat as regards procedure owing to difficulties made by^the local quarantine authorities. Two cases of chicken-pox and one of small-pox were refused embarkation on the steamship Akhar on the 28th March; two cases of chicken-pox and one of convalescent small-pox by the Rahmani on the 5th April; and on the 10th April the Akhar again refused two cases of chicken-pox. 50. In returning ships, the following cases occurred during the voyage :— Steamship Islami, the 26th March, 3 chicken-pox. Steamship Rahmani, the 5th April, 1 chicken-pox. Steamship Akhar, the 28th April, 3 chicken-pox; 1 modified small-pox. Tor. 51. Eeturning pilgrim ships were subjected to the usual detention of three days. The Alexandria Quarantine Board declared the pilgrimage clean on the 1st April, but subsequent discovery of cholera vibrios in certain pilgrims suffering from diarrhoea led them to impose certain restrictions on pilgrims proceeding via Egypt. Suakin. 52. Pilgrims returning to Africa via the Sudan underwent the usual five days' detention at Suakin. Two cases of chicken-pox and one of leprosy were rejected by Khedivial Mail ships, but proceeded upon recovery. Jedda. 53. No quarantine measures were necessary, or were applied, in respect of pilgrim ships or pilgrims this year, although some anxiety was manifested in India owing to the ' adoption ' of the International Sanitary Convention of 1926, with many reservations (in respect of article 127 inter alia) by the Saudi Government (referred to at paragraph 20 above). 54. The Port Medical Service was maintained by one doctor only, Dr. Ibrahim Adham, until about two weeks before Haj day, when Dr. Yahya (see paragraph 40 of last year's report) returned. Dr. Ibrahim Adham was less obstructive again, except in respect of the vaccination and inoculation ot returning pilgrims, where, as has been noted, to spare his susceptibilities and maintain Legation control, a modified procedure was adopted. 'iti11 55. Dr. Muhammed Saleh came to Jedda as representative of the Alexandria Quarantine Board. He was allowed to visit Mecca for the first time, although he has visited the Hejaz in this capacity on a number of previous occasions. The Saudi authorities, however, accorded no official recognition of his position as representative of the Board. 56. As recorded above at paragraph 24, the Legation repatriated 1,500 destitute West Africans during the cool weather. All were vaccinated and inoculated at the Government of India Dispensary at Jedda, owing to stipulation by the Government of Eritrea (most of the Takrunis were shipped to Massawa) that such precautionary measures, of a quarantine nature, should be taken here. (4) Health. General. 57. The health of pilgrims during the 1935 season was satisfactory and climatic conditions good, though possibly not so favourable as last year. Saudi Medical Service. 58. No attempt was made to recruit the depleted strength of medical personnel (vide paragraph 44 of last year's report), in spite of the promise of an increased Haj. There was, however, no demand this year upon the medical service for military purposes as was occasioned in 1934 by the Yemen war. The following is the distribution during the season, based on a list supplied by the Indian medical officer, except for transfers to Mecca for temporary service at the height of the pilgrimage ;— Mecca. —Five, including the Director-General of Public Health, a dentist and a newly-engaged analytical chemist. In addition, there is a mid wife; and one other doctor, who worked during the pilgrimage, resigned soon after. There appears to be no surgeon. Jedda.—¥&lt;mv, including two quarantine doctors, and two doctors (one, a newly-appointed Turk, is a bacteriologist) at the hospital. There is, m addition, a midwife. Medina. —One doctor.

This total of 14 (excluding the Unani doctor an ^ ^ ^ 0 . comprises 12 Syrians, 1 Turk and 1 Egyptian, all of 'hT hofd qualifications, except the director-general and ^e a ~ § V rian director- Turkish degrees.

Staff arrangements for this undertaking were stated to be quite inadequate. Medina. —As recorded earlier in this report, a movement is on foot in India to provide Medina with a hospital; a Government hospital is also projected. ' JW/.—The construction of a hospital was commenced during the year, and is believed to be proceeding. 62. The Indian medical officer is even more emphatic this year than last (vide paragraph 47 of last year's report) in his observations regarding defective Saudi medical services. Yet with defective equipment and inadequate personnel the Government indulged in rather ambitious legislative enactments copied from more advanced countries. 63. The following statement of cases treated and deaths in Government hospitals has been prepared by the Indian medical officer from weekly returns published in the local press. Dr. Abdul Hamid points out that the statement is not complete for the year the 1st June, 1934, to the 31st May, 1935, as for a number of weeks, for some unexplained reason, no returns were published :— Disease Dysentery ... Small-pox ... Consumption Syphilis Typhoid Measles Chicken-pox Puerperal fever Leprosy Mumps Paratyphoid Whooping-cough Dengue Influenza ... Diphtheria ... Tetanus Meningitis These figures are given for what they are worth and at best can only give a partial idea of the prevalence of disease in a country so poorly provided with hospitals. They indicate that dysentery, small-pox and syphilis would appear to have increased over last year. Diseases during the Pilgrimage Season. H 64. Pilgrims remained largely unaffected by small-pox and chicken-pox in J the xiejaz. Cases refused embarkation for India and cases occurring during the return voyage to India are noted at paragraphs 49 and 52 above. 65. During the actual pilgrimage, influenzal catarrh and influenzal pneumonia were rife many deaths being due to the latter. Malaria was common and cases oi sun-stroke, none fatal, were reported, the days passed at Muna being somewhat hotter. After the Haj, dysentery and diarrhoea were very common, the daily attendance at the Legation dispensary being as many as 60 to 80 for these ,, - complaints alone. J p aK 66. The general health of the local inhabitants showed much improvement, l^en malaria being the chief scourge. ^here Mortality. i abnnf &lt; ^ ea f t ^ y ear is estimated by the Indian medical officer at and at MnS p OU ¥ e ^at of last year. At Arafat one death only occurred Muna thirty-five m the three days, also double last year's figure. ^ Number of cases.

Dr. Abdul Hamid describes these as worse than last year, which would scarcely seem possible. Absence of latrines, lack of arrangements for the disposal of carcases, prevalence 01 mosquitoes, infection of water-supply. &amp;c., a truly formidable catalogue. _ETis Medical Hints to Pilgrims ' was again published in the press in India, and was thought to have proved useful. 69. The temperature on Haj day was the same as last year, ranging; between 85° and 97° F. fater Supply. 70. There was no change in conditions at Mecca this year, whilst at Muna and Aral at water was abundant and much cheaper, at 5 piastres for 4 gallons, than the extortionate prices of last year. The new bacteriologist and the analytical chemist are stated to have reported adversely on Ain Zubeyda water and recommended the use of iron pipes underground. 71. The Jedda water-supply, described at paragraph 56 in last year's report, remained much the same, except that progress had been made in laying down pipes in the town to various distributing points. The work is not by any means complete, the important distributing point at the quarantine quay not having been commenced Money is still required, but handsome donations were received during the pilgrimage from the Nawab of Bahawalpur, the Begum of Hyderabad and others. Government of India Dispensaries. 72. The Jedda Dispensary remained open as usual throughout the year. The staff remained unchanged, the retention of the third dispenser and sweeper being sanctioned. The third dispenser, however, left for India after the pilgrimage and is due to be replaced during the summer of 1935. Minor repairs and white-washing were carried out and another room was tiled. Special attendance registers, supplied by the Government of India, were brought into use this year. 73. The Mecca Dispensary opened on the 13th January and closed on the Uth May. As Dr. Hamid Hussin had gone to Medina, Dr. Muhammad Khan {vide paragraph 58 of the report for 1933) was appointed sub-assistant surgeon. His work and that of his staff was satisfactory, particularly in view of the increased pilgrimage. Arrangements for Haj week, including attendance at Arafat and Muna were similar to those of previous years. At Muna when the Indian vice-consul and Indian medical officer are always obliged to hire jomt accommodation at their own expense, this year on account of greater demand, separate accommodation (the Indian vice-consul in tents) had to sumce. 74. The attitude of the Saudi authorities towards the Government of India dispensaries continued to be one of complete non-recognition. e a i u e o the Director-General of Public Health towards the Mecca Dispensary and the Indian medical officer calls for no special comment this yeai\ Conversations on the general position of the dispensaries proceeded thioug ou e 7 • August 1934 the Saudi Government aggravated the , slt ^ tlo i n fi ^ ir 1 p SS ^ f circular to foreign missions asking that the missions s ou * . ^ separate statements of medical supplies imported for e * P .i latter those for other uses in order that customs dues could e ^ no-rppd to leave the Pending further discussion, the Saudi Government even u ' - » oonsi^nment of situation intact, and under this agreement allowed ® ronsiffnment from medical supplies to come in duty free.

Vms Treated in the Indian Dispensaries. r ^ oriacirv f ^ 75. The total number of eases treated a M e wl th 42.500 last 1st June, 1934, to the 31st May 1935, was ^ between the year. Of these, the number of ^dian pug compared with 4,841 30th November, 1934, to the 31st May, 193 , -V from the 13th January for the last year. The number of cases treated at Mecca trom tne14 Ita ncM to the 15th May was 20,306 as compared with 13,109 last year. At Mecca nearly ^ all patients were pilgrims, very few being Hejazi and other subjects. During three days at Muna 310 cases were treated. 76. Indoor cases this year totalled thirty-six as compared with forty-seven: 11 of last year. Dr. Abdul Hamid performed 326 major operations and 3,540 minor ' operations. Lack of accommodation, &amp;c., for indoor cases does not permit of much increase in indoor work and operations. a 77. The observations, as to a comparison in numbers treated in the Indian and Saudi medical institutions, apply this year as before {vide paragraph 63 of 1933 report). jgM 78. The total amount collected up to the 31st December, 1934, from patients for medicines supplied amounted to 234 rials. From January 1935 the practice of charging was discontinued, in view of the controversy with the Saudi Govern- eme J ment over the general dispensary question. ap oul 79.

The practice noted in paragraph 65 of the report for 1933 in respect of a charge of 5 rupees to the cost of transport being made to patients in their own quarters was followed again this year. About eighty-five visits were made free to indigent persons. 81. The difficulty with regard to dispensing outside prescriptions {vide paragraph 65 of last year's report) occurred again this year, but to a much less extent. 82. Mahmud Hamdi also instructed all local dispensaries that no outside prescriptions should be dispensed unless given by a doctor licensed to practice by the Director-General of Public Health. Other Foreign Medical Assistance. 83. The Egyptian consulate still maintained its doctor, but medicines and instruments were reported to be still lacking. The Egyptian Government sent the usual medical mission during the pilgrimage season, consisting of two, the consulate doctor acting as the head of the mission. They worked as last year, in Mecca for one month only. 84. Ihe Afghan mission was as elementary as ever. A new doctor, Ahmed Ali Punjabi, retired from the service of the Government of India, was appointed instead of Dr. Saleh, who had come here for three successive years. 85. The Dutch doctor, Abdur Rahman, as last year, worked at Mecca. The Dutch Legation was reported to have no intention of reopening their Jedda dispensary. ■'-'Itisaiiii Wgen- kind: p\] atten ^ arrai ^ases oi 'Wi ,, out] inju „, ^ ae-i /. 15 /') i ( 86. A new Italian doctor, as already noted, has recently set up in private practice. 87. The Russian doctor George (vide paragraph 68 of last year's report) worked up to the middle of May 1935, when he was removed and sent back to Russia, on account, it was reported, of frequenting certain White Russians here in the Saudi Air Service. The dispensary was closed. The dentist resumed his work upon his return from Hodeida, while the Minister's wife, Mme. Turakoulov, was said to have given up her work. A Russian lady doctor, Amina, was said to be attending the King's family at Riyadh. Medical Arrangements on Pilgrim Ships. 88. The medical arrangements on the new ship, the steamship Islami, were a great improvement. A recommendation by the Legation that the crew of every pilgrim ship should be vaccinated and inoculated at least once every pilgrim season was accepted by the Port Haj Committee, Bombay. The same authority also agreed that a strict medical examination of ship's hotel managers and servants should be made periodically, for such diseases as tuberculosis, syphilis and gonorrhoea, as cases had been reported. Various suggestions regarding medical diaries were also accepted. For questions concerning transport from ship to shore, the compulsory food system, &amp;c., see paragraphs 105 and 154 respectively. (5) Internal Transport. 89. The chorus of complaints raised after the 1934 pilgrimage, regarding the hardships and difficulties, due to inefficiency of the motor transport oreanisation, experienced by all classes of pilgrims able to afford that means 01 conveyance to the Holy Places, led Ibn Sand to convene a conference at laii in the early summer of tliat year, as described in paragraph 73 of last year s repor . The following rules were framed ;— (i) Each motor company to possess a fleet of thirty vehicles ( inste ad of twenty as previously) consisting of twenty-four buses and six ca . (ii) Of these vehicles 10 per cent, were to be new lords. (iii) All vehicles to be ready for inspection by the b e gin nin g of Ra^ab.^^^^ (iv) All vehicles of any one company to be presented for inspection toge (v) Infpec n Ung m bodics were appointed and a committee to superintend organisation during the year. on Thp rnlp^ however were not observed, particularly as regards thoroughness^ of inspection^ with the result ^at motor transpor^ ^ had been too impoverished to renew and repair } el j; n iirr r i m s to even greater which, according to the Indian vice-consul, su 3^ ire summarised hy Khan hardships in 1935 than in the previous year. These are summarised oy Bahadur Ihsanullah as follows :■— (a)Large numbers of vehicles hundreds refused t 0 ^ n ^ ue ^ otor ' transport administration provided The ^aqa,Da vice -consul was able finally to attempted to insist, but the inaian viu arrange for the vehicles to be c ange • on ^e Medina road. (h) Cases occurred of pilgrims spen • £ several nationalities com- (c) Complaints were again heard ot pilgrims 01 posing one bus load. o-, o-p (d)Reckless driving led to ^voidable delay on pilgrims leaving (c) Muzawwars were blamed for mucti avoiuau Medina. , , , f this year; a bus caught fire (/) There was an unusual number Indian female pilgrims and on the Medina an lndian female pilgrim was run over iniurins: a number 01 otners, cu £ i n ^ ur y occurred, by a buf and killed a for the hotels to run (g) As last year no special arrangements were m cars for their clients.(A tV 16 {h) Particular hardship was experienced on the sandy stretch between Mastura and Bir bin Hassan on the Medina road. This led to an appeal to prominent Indian pilgrims by others of their number to consider a proposal to re-construct the Medina road. 91. As already noticed above, Sharqieh (Limited) continued this year with a modified concession for the import of Ford motor vehicles for pilgrimage traffic. 92. The proportion of the poorer classes of pilgrim was as great in this year of larger numbers as last, as may be seen from the fact that only about 11,000 pilgrims travelled to Medina by motor this year. Nor were users of motor transport between Jedda and Mecca as numerous as might be expected. The steamship Islami, for example, arrived on the 31st December with 835 pilgrims from Indian ports (the majority being non-Indians), of whom forty-five only travelled to Mecca by car, eighty by camel, the rest walked. 93. Difficulty was experienced in meeting a greater demand this year from well-to-do Indian pilgrims for motor transport to Arafat. The charges, unlike last year, were per person, instead of per car or per bus, viz. : £1^ gold travelling by bus and £2J gold by six- and four-seater cars. 94. Renewed complaints by a stream of deputations to Ibn Saud of the motor transport organisation led him to convene, after the Haj, another conference on the lines of that of last year. This year the King insisted on the amalgamation of all motor-car companies into one single corporation. A committee was formed and companies were called on to surrender their vehicles, against assessment of value. The corporation was to consist of two sections^ one comprising vehicles attached to it by the companies and the other of Govern ment vehicles. None but corporation vehicles were to be allowed to ply for hire. It was too early, at the end of the period under review, to judge of the merits of the scheme, but car companies were stated to be surrendering only their most worthless cars, retaining their better ones in the hope of sale for cash either to private individuals or to the corporation at the height of the next pilgrimage. 95. As already stated, the private visit of the Indian vice-consul to Medina led him to suggest various reforms, for recommendation to the Saudi authorities. Although that course was approved, no suitable opportunity occurred, owing to the intrigues, according to Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, of Muhammad Khan Ghazi Khan and Ismail Ghuznavi. Of the proposals mentioned at paragraph 74 of last year's report, only those at (c) and {d) appear to have been adopted. 96. It is estimated that, as last year, about 60 per cent, of the Indian pilgrimage visited Medina by motor this year. Overland Routes. 97. A new feature in the pilgrimage, anticipated in paragraph 83 of last year s report, resulted from an agreement reached between the Governments of /Saudi Arabia and Iraq early in 1935 for the opening of a new motor route between Nejef and Medina, whereby Iraqi transport companies were to carry pilgrims to Medina, whence they would be conveyed to Mecca in Saudi vehicles. It was agreed that the Iraqi Government should allow only five-seater motor cars to operate during the present Haj season. The rather meagre total of 398 pilgrims, including a party of seventy-odd Iraqi boy scouts and twenty-two British Indians, were transported from Nejef to Medina by this overland route. The fare for four- and five-seater cars from Nejef to Medina was £18 gold and £15 gold respectively. Pilgrims had to pay a'further £151 gold per head for their transport from Medina to Mecca and back by bus, including mutawwifs' fees and quarantine dues. 98. A number of vehicles left Ahmedabad, India, again this year, intending to travel overland all the way. After great difficulty, two reached Nejef, where their passengers were obliged to transfer into Iraqi vehicles for Medina. Not all were able to pay the fare and the unfortunate ones had to be left behind. Again, the venture cannot be said to have been a conspicuous success. t r ^ e mo ^ ( ? r rou t e from Koweit, via Riyadh, to Mecca, though still believed to be very imperfectly organised, was used by a party of Indian pilgrims this year, who arrived too late for the Haj. 100. The so-called route from Hasa to Mecca, via Riyadh, apparently does not enjoy the official countenance of the Saudi Government, but notices werer\ 17 posted in the bazaar at Bahrein last autumn that the Saudi authorities would be prepaied to carry up to fifty pilgrims to the Hejaz for £10 gold, or £15 gold return. The notice was withdrawn on the representations of the Political Agent. Subsequently, an Indian, named Zafar Mirza, has been working to obtain sanction to open this route in connexion with sailings from Karachi to Bahrein. His pretensions to have secured a concession from the Saudi Government were denied by the Minister of inance. The Legation maintained its attitude of discouraging the use of all unorganised or semi-organised overland routes. 101. A further overland route engaged the attention of a number of enter prising Syrians, who in two convoys made the journey, after the Haj, from Damascus to Medina, via the Wadi Sirhan and the Hejaz Railway track, with great hardship in seventeen days. They returned in less time and with less difficulty via Mudawwara and Maan. Camels. 102. Those who travelled by camels this year experienced unusual difficul ties, both in respect of delay and hardships; and written and verbal complaints were numerous. Under transport regulations, a camelman could get no more than 34 rupees for the journey to Medina and back out of the total of £10 gold Or 240 rupees recovered from a pilgrim against this item; the balance passes to the Government Treasury. The poverty of the camelmen, coupled with the local drought in Medina, sent up the price of fodder and camels practically starved, becoming too weak to carry their loads. Pilgrims had often, therefore, to walk long distances. 103.—(a) At paragraph 92 above it has been mentioned that out of 835 pilgrims arriving by the Islami, forty-five travelled to Mecca by motor vehicles and eighty by camels, while the rest walked on foot. This news greatly agitated the Saudi Minister of Finance, who ordered an investigation. It transpired that camelmen were evading the regulations by hiring their camels to pedestrian pilgrims for a nominal sum, after having passed through the 'Koshan' gate of Jedda. The camels found thus engaged were forfeited to the Government and the camelmen imprisoned ; subsequently the latter were released and the camels returned to them, but it served as a warning both to the Wakils at Jedda and to the camelmen. (b) About 1,000 souls travelled from Koweit by camel, being exempted from payment of dues. They travelled via Burayda, instead of by the designated route through Jerriya-ilya. Cabs. 104. The same practice as last year was followed in respect of the use of cabs in the town of Mecca. Dhows. 105. (Reference paragraph 78 of last year's report.) As the arrangement was renewed for one year only, the Government of India were again asked to continue the arrangements between Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co. and selves for the conveyance of pilgrims and their luggage between ship and s ore and vice versa for a further period of one year. It, however, had again cer am defects and was a source of complaint and was to receive the attention o e Legation for further recommendation to the Government oi India. General. 106. No attempt even was made this year to prevent pilgrims from travelling on foot between Mecca and Jedda, and many of the poorer, especially Afg an and Bokharan, pilgrims did so travel. But the prohibition ' to Medina was more strictly enforced. Those willing to walk to Medina had to obtain permission from the Saudi Government. Mut f w ^f^^[led on fwt responsible. Nevertheless, a good number of pilgrims actually travelled on foot to Medina. [12098] d18 107. Motives of economy still led a few hundred^ pilgrirns to postpone their trip to Medina until after the reduction of the 'Koshan (paragraph 80 of last year's report). The Government, with an eye to revenue, fixed the Koshan rate for the journey during the non-pilgrimage season, differentiating between foreigners and Saudi subjects. The rates were as follows for the return journey :— Foreigners : £2 gold and 3^ rials. Saudi subjects : £1 gold and If rials. 108. The Minister of Finance promised the Indian vice-consul that, on presentation of a memorial to him by British subjects resident in Medina, he would consider the request for the restoration of the privilege of reduced ' Koshan ' rates enjoyed by them alike with Saudi subjects (paragraph 81 of last year's report). No action was, however, taken by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, although the memorial was submitted in good time. As a result, many who could not afford the higher rates were unable to perform the Haj. 109. An Indian pilgrim, who arrived at Jedda by sea, travelled to Mecca on a bicycle. He was held up on the Mecca road until a sum of 64 piastres miri was recovered from his wakil on account of 'Koshan.' He was then allowed to resume his journey. It is worth mentioning that this is the first instance of a bicycle reaching Mecca; previous cyclists having been less fortunate. (6) Customs. 110. The remarks at paragraph 85 of last year's report regarding smuggling and venality apply with equal force to the year under review. 111. After the pilgrimage season was over a local newspaper announced that the Government had decided to reduce the customs duties on a number of important articles, e.g., petrol, tobacco, artificial silk, perfumes, disinfectants. Unofficial confirmation of this was latter obtained from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Reluctance to make an official announcement may be explained by the fact that the reduction related to tbbacco and certain other commodities, viewed by strict Wahhabis with repugnance. Economically the reductions, especially that on petrol, would seem to reveal a confidence in the financial position of the country, inspired by the larger pilgrimage of this year. The abolition of all duties on disinfectants was doubtless inspired by the present movement to show the world how modern Saudi Arabia is in matters concerning public health. (7) Religious Policy. 112. Committees of virtue in the principal towns of the Hejaz continued to exist, but had their powers considerably curtailed by Royal order. After the Haj the force of special constables employed under the committees of virtue was abolished and the local police entrusted with their duties. These developments have been welcomed, and a much greater laxity in public was apparent on all sides. The enjoyment of music, both gramophone and vocal, and of smoking in public places, was latterly quite common. 113. A powerful stimulus to this movement was given when permission, unpublished but official, was accorded in January to import radio sets. This relaxation, which primarily affects the coastal towns, may be expected to have important influences on the life of the country. The immediate result was to render night more hideous than ever before, with the oriental harmonies received over the ether from Cairo largely obliterated by ear-splitting atmospherics. There has been some reaction, it is said, in Wahhabi circles, but no restrictions had been imposed at the end of the period under review. Radios were also said to be in private, but secret, use in the households of notables at Mecca and Taif. 114. Although pilgrims had less reason to complain this year of excessive religious zeal shown by the authorities, the usual restrictions on visits to tombs and shrines were officially maintained, but unofficially circumvented. 115. The greater religious tolerance evident did not prevent the occurrence of isolated incidents, as when in Jedda towards the end of 1934 the beating of a19 frate^eddawis C and 1 'the t Do^p di ^h' 3r f^ r l at ^ m0Sque led to a fracas between irate Jeddawis and the police. About eighty local inhabitants were thrown into prison and many flogged m consequence. wn into 116. A grievance of Indians who marry Heiazi o&gt;i r l s here is that tW forbidden by fetwa of the Sharia Court to take their wives to India. (8) Mutawwifs. 117. No change of importance affected the mutawwif fraternity during the year under The recommendations of the Indian vice-consul, referred to in paragraph 90 of last year's report (cf. paragraph 107 {a) of 1933 report), at last materialised m the appointment of a certain Abdul Hye Daud, of Mecca, as the permanent naqib of Jedda. This recognised the principle of having the sheikh of the wakils from outside the body of the wakils themselves. The action of the Saudi Government in not selecting a man for this office from Jedda itself should enable its incumbent to remain aloof from the personal affairs and interests of the wakil class. 118. The efforts of the Indian vice-consul to secure a body of wakils exclusively devoted to Indian pilgrims were neutralised to some extent by the wiles of the wealth}^ and influential ex-naqib, who was able to arrange for his son to be appointed a wakil for Indian mutawwifs independent of the new naqib. The father continued to enjoy his own agency for non-Indian mutawwifs, and presently, jointly with the son, to exercise his old control over such questions as pilgrims' lodgings, &amp;c. Complaints were not slow in being made, even by leading Indians, that Egyptians and other non-Indians, wards of the father, were being given preference in accommodation, &amp;c. Other ex-wakils were beginning to apply to Government for agencies in the names of relatives, and it was said that, money talking so powerfully, certain deserving and respectable wakils had been displaced in this disagreeable intrigue. 119. Other recommendations of the Indian vice-consul were adopted (paragraph 107 {a) of the 1933 report), except one requiring the personal presence of wakils at Jedda to meet incoming pilgrims. If instructions were given, they were apparently ignored by one prominent and wealthy wakil of Mecca. 120. The question of the conduct of pilgrim guides (paragraph 93 of last year's report) whilst in India, Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies was the object of further serious consideration by the Saudi Government. Complaints were numerous, and a typical case, occurring in respect of Malaya, is described later at paragraph 188 of this report. Mutawwifs when abroad sometimes took advances from pilgrims in respect of dues, granting in return a letter of credit on their agents in the Hejaz and then remained behind, whilst their agents here were unable to meet the demands of the letters, and the Saudi authorities found great difficulty in collecting dues from the pilgrims. The Minister of Finance, after a short period in which he was inclined to forbid mutawwifs from going to India, Malaya and the Dutch East Indies, finally, after consulting the Indian vice -conul, decreed that mutawwifs might proceed to the above countnes provided that each produced a reputable guarantor in case claims arose against them later on, and also that each undertook, before a^ court, to lefiain fiom bargaining with pilgrims or causing similar mischief. Sabees weie entirely forbidden to go to these countries, except such as were designated by mutawwifs themselves unable to go. As regards mutawwifs for other nationalities than the above, they would be allowed to proceed provided they undertook to return before the commencement of the next pilgrimage. 121 The Saudi Government, in framing these regulations, were perhaps actuated more by financial motives, viz., to prevent spendthrift mutawwifs from throwing their money away in foreign countries, than by any others. It remains to be seen whether there will be any improvement as a result in the conduct of this not very desirable element in Haj propaganda. 122 The Indian vice-consul draws attention to the difficulties he has been confronted with owing to the intrigues against him of the agitators Muhammad Khan Ghazi Khan and Ismail Ghuznavi, though it is not believed these will piove a more serious factor. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah reports that his relations with mutawwifs and wakils have been perfectly harmonious. The maintenance of the black-list system has again proved its usefulness. [12098]123. No new instances of misconduct by mutawwifs came to notice other than cases similar to those reported in paragraph 95 of last year s leport. 124. (Paragraph 96 of last year's report.) I he payment of dues m advance at Jedda was again a source of difficulty, in spite of the wide circulation in India of warnings against leaving with less than the prescribed amount of money. A party of thirty Sindhis refused to pay dues on landing on grounds of destitution. 125. There was no change in the ' 1 aqrir system, although representa tions were made to Ibn Saud and the Minister of Finance. 126. (Paragraph 99 of last year's report.) No progress with the Minister of Finance was made in connexion with the proposal to have Indians of the Shia faith placed under the care of the Indian Sheikh-ul-MutawwifuL 127. No improvement was reported in the conduct of the muzawwars ' of Medina. As stated earlier in this report, the Indian vice-consul desired to make certain recommendations, after his private visit to Medina, but for various reasons no suitable opportunity presented itself. The reconimendations concerned, inter alia, muzawwars and the abolition of the taqrir system. (9) Pilgrimage Tariff and Cost of Pilgrimage. 128. There was no change in the pilgrim tariff in 1935, but there was considerable delay in publishing the schedules, so that the Legation were obliged to proceed with the customary notification to the Government of India and other British Governments interested in the pilgrimage, basing themselves upon oral assurances received from the Minister of Finance. The schedule was published on the 5th November, 1934, and duly circulated. Tentative estimates were prepared and forwarded to the Government of India on the 4th October, for inclusion in the Pilgrim Guide, to be published for the future by the Port Haj Committee, Bombay. 129. As will be seen from paragraph 17 above, the Saudi authorities are believed to be contemplating for next 3^ear a 25 per cent, reduction on all dues and charges payable by the pilgrim. It remains to be seen whether the reduction will actually be introduced; it was promised in a leaflet distributed to returning pilgrims by the Haj Committee here. 130. The adoption of the recommendation mentioned at paragraph 103 of last year's report again proved of great convenience, and many pilgrims availed themselves of the opportunity to await in Mecca the arrival of their ships. 131. The proposals at paragraphs 104, 105 and 106 of last year's report were not pursued this year. 132. Difficulties in respect of payment of dues by poorer pilgrims have already been referred to at paragraph 124 above. 133. Indian pilgrims again failed to realise that Saudi dues are fixed in terms of gold, and that variations in the exchange value of gold would alter the estimates. Tentative estimates were prepared when the rate was 22 rupees per gold pound. At the height of the season the rate moved to 24 rupees. 134. The tariff, once again, did not include charges for motor transport from Mecca to Arafat and back. The rates for this, however, have been given at paragraph 93 above. 135. Transport charges for Medina were the same as those for last year. For postponement of visit until ' Koshan ' was reduced, see paragraph 107 above. (10) Indian Pilgrimage. 136. (Paragraph 114 of last year's report.) Questions relating to the Indian pilgrimage have continued to be dealt with individually as they arose, and no comprehensive review has been submitted to the Government of India. 137. The Indian pilgrimage began this year with the arrival of the steam ship Alavi on the 26th November, 1934, and the stream of arrivals ended with the steamship A khar on the 11th March, 1935. 138. The following table shows the number of pilgrims from each province of India and from Ceylon, classified according to ports of embarkation :—22 Chinese Turkestan showed a decrease over last year, while pilgrims from Persia and other places in the Persian Gulf appear to have deserted the Indian route to the Holy Land. 142. According to information from the Saudi passport officer at Jedda, the numbers of Indian pilgrims who arrived from other than Indian ports, as well as of those who left by other routes, were as follows :— Arrivals. Departures. 157 75 58 34 38 13 2 Suez Port Sudan ... Aden South Africa Dutch East Indies and Malaya Zanzibar and East Africa Eritrea Hodeida 264 32 5 1 151 In addition to the above, twenty-two Indian pilgrims arrived, by motor vehicle overland from India via Iraq, and returned by the same route; and 542 on foot via Nejd, Yemen, Iraq and Palestine, who were repatriated eventually at the expense of the Government of India. 143. The Mogul Line fleet of Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Go. was again the only line engaged in the pilgrimage traffic from India this year. 144. The following table shows the movement of return traffic with details of the number of ships available on given dates for repatriation of pilgrims, the number of pilgrims awaiting repatriation and the number actually repatriated :— Dates. 1935— March 24 March 25 March 26 March 28 April 5 April April April May May June July 10 22 28 10 20 10 12 No. of ships in port.

The following table shows the distribution of the totals given in the preceding paragraph by ports of embarkation and destination. In the circum stances mentioned in paragraph 124 of last year's report, it has again been possible this year to give the exact number of pilgrims who returned to Bombay or Karachi Pilgrims Pilgrims Port. embarked. returning. Bombay ... ... ... 5,852 5,661 Karachi ... ... ... 6,702 7,401 Calcutta ... ... 525 13,079 13,062 147. The following is a statement of the number of pilgrims who purchased single and return tickets in India, or deposited the amount of return passage :— Port. Deposit. Single. Return. Total. Bombay Karachi €alcutta 22 215 91 26 5,637 6,589 499 5,852 6,702 525 22 332 12,725 13,079 148. It is to be regretted that the number of pilgrims who deposited the amount of their return passage was only twenty-two this year, of which total Bombay s share is nil. It is, however, more satisfactory to note that the number of single ticket holders was comparatively small, considering that this figure includes mostly pilgrims travelling first or second class. loreign pilgrims travelling via Indian ports are now accustomed to travel with return tickets, so there would seem no necessity now to analyse single ticket holders under separate columns, ' Indian ' and ' Foreign.' . Return of Pilgrims to India: General. 149. Although the number of arrivals this year from Indian ports was more by 3 239 than last year, arrangements made by the shipping company for the return iourney were satisfactory. In one case, however on the steamship Alavi on the 10th April, it was found that 314 pilgrims had been left behind, due to the lack of accommodation on board They proved a source of iuoonvenience to the Legation, until put on board the steamship Islami on the 22nd April. As the period of detention of this batch of ^tween thirteen and fifteen days, no compensation allowance was payable. The shipping company were not called on to pay detention allowance to pilgrims during the year under rev^w .tioned in paragraph 131 0 f last year's report the Indian vice- consul was again faced with persistent requests by many better-ciass pilgrims, who tra^elMwHh first or second-class return tickets, for the re|ervation of their passages by telegrams, &amp;c., m advance, in ffg® 8 E xalted rotation svstem His Highness the Nawab of Bahawalpur and Her r.xa te Highness the Badsha-Begum of Hyderabad together with certain personages, were exempted from the operation of the rotation system, under a specia^ ruli^ obtained ^ 1S i as f ^ ear ^ s r^ort.) The new pilgrim ship helped to remove dilhculties in respecu o steamship Islamt, on ^ ^ d em ™d still exceeded Ae^suppl^ ^thejai ^ the 22nd April, eigb ^ ^ m^priwrs Apart from this instance constrained to travel vol ^ nta 'Jf t n ' s ^ 0 nd-dass pilgrims also travelled as Pilg'™ ^cted to travel second-class, on the homeward journey to India.24 152. On one occasion during the season, the local shipping agents informed the Legation that the steamship Alavi was to sail on the 25th April. Pilgrims in Medina and Mecca were duly notified, and about 473 of them reached Jedda before the given date. The ship, however, did not sail until the 28th April, and the pilgrims approached the Legation with a view to obtaining the compensation allowance provided under sections 149 ff. of Pilgrim Ship Rules, 1933. This was, however, ruled out on the grounds of being applicable to ports in British India only and not to Jedda. 153. ' Difficulty was experienced this year in connexion with the arrival of the last pilgrim ship, steamship Akhar, as late as the 11th March, although the authorities concerned in India had been informed by the Legation that the last pilgrim ship should arrive not later than the morning of the 10th March. Importance is attached to the matter, particularly as the majority of pilgrims, who use camels as means of transport or travel on foot, are left with a narrow margin to get to Mecca in time for the Haj. Apart from usual delays and difficulties in clearing luggage, &amp;c., from the customs, this period of the pilgrimage season is one of congestion and disorganisation in Mecca, where all concerned are occupied in preparation for the pilgrims' departure for Arafat. Food, Accommodation, &amp;c. 154. The second year of the operation of certain of the amendments to the Indian Merchant Shipping Act (paragraph 139 of last year's report) was one in which the defects noted last year, in spite of some adjustments, again gave rise to strong criticism and complaint. Pilgrims of much higher standing and in larger numbers are now making the Haj, and greater conveniences, better food and improved service are demanded. Reports by committees of pilgrims and the complaints of individuals were, during the year, unanimous in asking for radical improvement, and very vigorous criticism was directed by almost every committee to such questions as baths and latrines, accommodation and storage of heavy luggage, attendants to be Moslems, and, in great volume, to the imperfections of the present food supply system. Upon all these, and many matters of subsidiary importance, the Legation has made recommendations and suggestions to the Government of India and the Bombay Port Haj Committee. Committees of Pilgrims. 155.— {a) The Legation recommended to the Government of India in 1934 the appointment of committees of pilgrims on board pilgrim ships, instead of Amirs-al-Haj. As a result, all the ships transporting pilgrims from India to the Hejaz in the year under review had committees aboard. It was, however, observed that Port Haj committees in Bombay and Karachi appointed separate members on board each pilgrim ship, resulting sometimes in somewhat unwieldy committees composed of eight members or more. (h) On return voyages, the Legation appointed, as last year, committees consisting of three educated pilgrims travelling by each ship. The Indian vice- consul was approached by some pilgrims to give adequate representation to the different provinces in the selection of the personnel for the committees. It was, however, pointed out that, although consideration was generally given to this point, it could not always be adopted for reasons of numbers, &amp;c' (c) Members of committees, both on the outward and the homeward voyages, did not confine themselves in their reports to the duties required of them by the terms of their letter of appointment, namely, ' .... to ensure satisfactory representation of the difficulties and complaints of the pilgrims on board the ship to her master. Their reports were invariably larded with suggestions for improvement which come within the scope of the new pilgrim-ship rules, yet in some respects they were very useful and helped to bring to the notice of the authorities concerned the views and demands of pilgrims. Pilgrim Passes. 156. The views expressed in paragraph 141 of last year's report were rein forced by experience gained in the year under review. A suggestion for a modified and more easily handled form of pilgrim pass was referred to the Government of India for their consideration in Jedda despatch of the 8th July last, wherein was enclosed a specimen form of pass made by the Indian vice- consul. The Indian Section of the Legation issued sixty-four duplicate passes/I 25 to pilgrims, who had lost their original pilgrim passes, and a further number of 580 emeigency passes to those who travelled overland on foot or who had remained in the Hejaz for more than one year and had lost their pilgrim passes. Refunds on Deposit-paid Passes. 157. The system, mentioned in paragraph 142 of last year's report, was again followed and proved very helpful to the pilgrims concerned, who were not required to wait for months as in the past. Registration. 158. The Legation arrangements continued to work satisfactorily, and 10,41&amp; Indian pilgrims, of the 11.113 shown in Table (A) of paragraph 43 above as having arrived by sea, registered at the Legation, the deficit being accounted for by the reasons mentioned in paragraph 143 of last year's report. 159. Fifty-nine unclaimed or unused return tickets and deposit-paid passes of 1934 were forwarded to the Commissioner of Police, Bombay. Applications received thereafter for refunds or return to India were dealt with in accordance with standing instructions of the Government of India. 160. Six Indian pilgrims who had not deposited their return tickets at this Legation and fifteen foreign pilgrims reported the loss of their return tickets. Arrangements similar to those described in paragraph 179 of 1932 report were made for all cases, to enable them to obtain passage. Local Haj Committee. 161. The local Haj Committee, mentioned in paragraph 148 of 1934 report, was again constituted as usual, under the presidency of the Indian vice-consul, for the purpose of regulating return passages to India. It sat at the house of the Indian vice-consul and did useful work. 162. The arrangements for the Hyderabad Pilgrimage were again satis factory this year. Although a responsible official of the State Government was appointed as ' Kafila Salar,' the caravan largely controlled its own affairs, in view of the presence of a large number of high btate officials following the \isit of Her Exalted Highness the Badsha Begum on pilgrimage. . 1 . 163. There was one stowaway this year from Calcutta. On the arrival o the ship at Jedda, the necessary amount was contributed by well-disposed pilgrims to cover his return passage. Thereupon, he was allowed to land and, atter tne pilgrimage, returned home. T) estitutes 164. There was, fortunately, a negligible increase in the number of destitutes this year over 1934, the figures being 562, as against 560. It would again appear that 'the number of those who came overland was considerable but ess in proportion to the total than last year, being 461 out of 562. table gives an analysis of the figures for this year by provinces g , (b) routes of access to the Hejaz : (a) Provinces of origin— Bengal Sind Punj ab Assam United Provinces North-West Frontier Bhopal State Kashmir Burma Kapurthala State Madras Rajputana ...

The authorities in India were again able to get a quotation of 40 rupees per head, excluding food and conveyance charges, direct from Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co. for the repatriation of destitutes. A sum of 285 rupees was collected from twelve of the individuals repatriated, who seemed able to contribute, in part, to the cost of their return. The actual amount expended on behalf of the Government of India was 26,892-8 • 0 rupees. 166. The usual precautions were taken to guard against fraud, to provide the authorities in India with lists of the persons repatriated and to take from each an undertaking to repay the money expended. 167. The attention of the Government of India was again drawn to the desirability of the control of pilgrims travelling on foot overland, in view of growing seriousness of this factor in the annual problem of disposing of Indian destitutes. ^ jL - n 26 (b) Route— (1) Overland— Via Gwadar-Muscat-Mokalla-Yemen .

Banking Facilities. 169. No change occurred in the position described in paragraph 156 of last £f ar ,® re P^ r •. The principal banking concerns in Jedda are still the Netherlands Irading bociety, which has branches in India, and Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., whose correspondents there are the National Bank of India The -Legation again deprecates the use of ' Hundis.' 170. Requests were again made this year by several leading pilgrims to make arrangements to cash drafts and make payments at Mecca and Medina. 1 P 0SI k®d by pilgrims, in the safe custody of this Legation, amounted to 47,835 rupees this year.

There was no marked change in the number of Afghan pilgrims, being 1,707, as against 1,720 last year. 173. It is worth noticing that in spite of the increasing use of overland routes, Afghans still seem to prefer the sea route via India. Although there was a fall in their number by thirteen pilgrims over last year, those who travelled from India were a little more numerous, being 1,668 as compared with 1,636 of last year; and almost all were either return-ticket holders or holders of deposit-paid passes. There was a negligible number of destitutes, and not more than eight came to the notice of this Legation, through their endeavours to pass themselves off as British subjects and so be repatriated at Government of India expense. The Afghan representative at Jedda paid no attention to them, and eventually the cost of their passage was borne by local charity. 174. The Afghan Government appointed their Minister in Cairo to represent them also in Saudi Arabia. The Minister presented his credentials on the 1st April, and also attended the Royal banquet. After the pilgrimage, the Minister left for Cairo, leaving behind the Afghan clerk in charge of the Legation. The Afghan Government have now opened a Legation in the Hejaz, and rented a house at Jedda for the purpose. The clerk, the only member of the staff, also left for Afghanistan about two months after the Haj, leaving the Legation in the charge of the doorkeeper, whose chief duty is to clean the premises and hoist the national flag, a newcomer among foreign flags in Jedda, on Fridays. 175. A new doctor, named Ahmed Ali, was deputed this year as medical mission from Afghanistan. By origin a Punjabi, he has been referred to at paragraph 84 above. As usual, he opened the dispensary both at Mecca and Mina for a short period only, and left for India by the steamship Rahmani on the 5th April, 1935. 176. The only Afghan notables to attend the pilgrimage this year were ex-King Amanullah, who came accompanied by his mother and brother-in-law. There was a general belief amongst Afghans and Indians that the visit of the ex-King was not unconnected with propaganda work in furtherance of his cause. He delivered a speech at the Royal banquet, reference to which has been made at paragraph 30 above. Reports were received that, in spite of the warnings conveyed by the Afghan representative, a number of Afghan nationals secretly visited the ex-King; and a large number of Indians, especially those from the Frontier Province, are stated to have similarly visited him. (12) Malayan Pilgrimage. Shipping (Outward from Malayan Points). 177 The first pilgrim ship from Singapore, steamship Bellerophon of the Blue Funnel Line, arrived at Jedda on the 11th November 1934, and was by three other ships of the same line at intervals of about a being- the steamship Protesilaus which reached Jedda on the 11th February The total number of pilgrims, including Dutch (from the N ® the ^ an 4 s Indies), American (from the Philippine Islands), and baudi Arab an nationalities, carried by these four ships, was 1,112, as compaied to 991 during last season. Number of Pilgrims. . . ^ . 17R The total number of pilgrims from British Malaya registered at the British Legatln during the season was 617. This was 257 per cent, more than fhe last sealon when the total was only 173. It is of interest to review the annual figures for the last ten seasons, as follows . Season. 1926 1927 1928 1929 1930 Number. 3,073 12,184 4,418 1,455 2,590 Season. 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935 Number. 506 80 101 173 617 12098]28 The present total of 617 was made np by places of origin, as follows :— Straits Settlements— Singapore ... ... ... • • • 46 Penang and Province Wellesley ... ... 45 Malacca ... ... ... ... 21 Labuan ... ... ... ... 0 Federated Malay States— Perak ... ... ... ... 89 Selangor ... ... ... ... 53 Pahang ... ... ... ... 27 Negri Sembilan ... ... ... 31 Unfederated Malay States— Johore ... ... ... ... 187 Kedah ... ... ... ... 41 Kelantan ... ... ... ... 63 Trengganu ... ... ... ... 14 Total ... ... ... 617 179. This welcome increase in numbers continues the process of gradual improvement observed over the past few years and is the best figure since 1930. Single Tickets. 180. Haji Abdul Majid points out that out of the present 617 arrivals, 32 or a little more than 5 per cent, came on single tickets, and remarks that in view of^the correspondence between this Legation and the Government of the Straits Settlements with the object of discouraging the practice of issuing single tickets, this can scarcely be regarded as satisfactory. It should be added that all the single tickets were issued at Penang, and that two of these single ticket- holders actually applied for repatriation before the Haj was completed. Pilgrim Passes. 181. The rule providing for the issue of a pilgrim pass to each pilgrim, even if a minor, was in some cases disregarded by the districts of (1) Kuala Langat in Selangor and (2) Batu Pahat in Johore; and this caused some difficulty in registering the pilgrims. Charges and Cost of Pilgrimage. 182. I he general nature and effects of the Saudi pilgrimage tariff are again discussed in a separate section of this report. The approximate rate of exchange this year was 22 to 24 rials = £1 gold = 14-50 = 15-50 Straits dollars on the average. 183. The cost of a return ticket Singapore-Jedda (including quarantine dues, &amp;c.) during the season under review was 181 dollars as compared with 182 clollars during the last season. Haji Abdul Majid estimates that the minimum cost tor the pilgrimage for the Malay pilgrim was :■— [а) To Mecca only, excluding maintenance, about 400 Straits dollars. (б) To Medina also, excluding maintenance, about 480 Straits dollars. 184. Keference has already been made to the distribution of pamphlets by the Jedda Haj Committee announcing a reduction of 25 per cent, on all charges m the Hejaz for the coming season. The new schedule of charges had not been received at the close of the period under review. ^ ^ 6W P^S r i ms came with insufficient money to pay their mutawwifs the -Duit Jamu of £6-40 gold Pts., which included, besides the mutawwifs' ees tor then services, &amp;c., the Government tax of £2^ for each person. It is important that pilgrims should not leave their countries of origin with msumcient money in their possession.29 Pensioners. 186. Although some Malay pensioners received their pensions regularly under the improved system through the British Legation at Jedda, it^would appear that some authorities in Malaya concerned with the payment of pensions were unaware that the system exists, for several pensioners declared here that they were told they could not be paid their pensions in Jedda. Hostels for Students in Mecca. 187. The idea of establishing hostels for the better accommodation and care of students in Mecca suggested by Haji Abdul Majid in 1933 has been taken up by the committee for the newly-started religious school for Jawi (Malay and Javanese) students, the 'Darul- 'Ulum'uddiniyah,' and circular-letters have been issued both in Malaya and the Dutch East Indies for donations to meet the cost of building. Tunku Mokhtar, a young brother of the wealthy Sultan of Langkat, is president of the committee. Mutawvnfs. 188. The unwisdom of pilgrims making payments in advance to mutawwifs or sheikhs was exemplified this season when five Malay pilgrims, whilst still in Singapore, paid to one Sheikh Abdullah Eawa, a mutawwif of Mecca, the authorised contract charges of £18 gold each and certain sums in addition against drafts on his Mecca agent. Abdullah Rawa did not return to the Hejaz for the Haj and his agent in Mecca was unable to honour the drafts presented by the pilgrims. Although the Saudi Government sent the agent to jail, the pilgrims' plight was not remedied and they missed the Medina visit, which had been included in the contract. Even their luggage containing food-stuffs had to be left in Jedda, although the transport of the luggage was also in the contract. The Government addressed the Legation officially on the subject, and a sum of 300 Straits dollars only was obtained, on referring the matter to the authorities at Singapore. The Saudi Government was still at the end of the period under review pressing for payment of the balance due. 189. It is instances of this nature that led the Saudi Government, as described at paragraph 120 above, to contemplate forbidding mutawwifs from proceeding to India, Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies, modified later on to insistence on the production of a guarantor, &amp;c., before a mutawwif proceeds to those countries. General Conditions during the Pilgrimage Season. 190. The report given by Haji Abdul Majid concerns matters that have already been adequately noticed elsewhere in this report. As last yeai, security was good, the prices of food-stuffs and water not exorbitant, petty thieving fairly common, and accidents from the greater number of cars used more frequent, but Al-hamdulillah, no Malays were injured. , 191 One or two cases where registered letters from Malaya were reported to have been delivered by the postal authorities to other than actual addressees came to notice. Whether this was mere inefficiency or not was not discovered. Mortality. . . . , 192. The total number of reported deaths among Malay pilgrims during the season ending the 19th April, 1935, was eighteen. This approximated to 3 pe cent, of the total number of arrivals against 1 per cent, ^ing the pre season. Despite the increase, it is not considered to be abnormal as in some previous years it went up to as much as 10 per cent, and 15 per cent. Effects of Deceased Pilgrims. 19^ The British Legation is still in correspondence with the baudi Arab Government ^^rding the effects of the two deceased pi grims from Province Wellesley, referred to in paragraph 179 of last year s report. ''iTT.uSaCK) W.. approved b, .h. Go«— of «.»*&lt; .««► ments this season for purposes of repatriating and giving pecuniarj assis a c [12098]30 to destitute pilgrims; and the whole of this amount was expended. The number of persons thus assisted was twelve, six of whom had to be supplied with tickets. Four of the six were pilgrims who had stayed nine or ten years in the Hejaz, but the remaining two were pilgrims who came this season and last season on single tickets, already referred to. Notabilities from Malaya. 195. Among the well-known persons who came on pilgrimage from Malaya this season were the following :— Inche Muhammad-bin-Haj i Abdul Rahman, a Justice of the Peace in Malacca; Dr. Ibrahim of Singapore; Inche Muhammad Jaffar, a Kedah Civil Servant; To' Puan Alang Sharipah of Perak (widow of the late Dato' Sri Adika Raja, I.S.O.); Inche Baharuddin, I.S.M.; Inche Muhammad-bin-Dato Muda, I .S .M. Staff. 196. Haji Abdul Majid, the Malay Pilgrimage Officer, arrived at Jedda on the 11th November, 1934, and left on the 19th April, 1935. Haji Muhammad Jamil satisfactorily assisted him as clerk for the sixth pilgrimage year. (13) West African Pilgrimage. 197. According to returns published by the Saudi authorities, 879 Takrunis (West Africans) of all nationalities entered the country via Red Sea ports. Yet lower down the scale, under the heading of ' Pilgrims who arrived via Qunfida,' the figure 285 is given. This number obviously includes pilgrims of several nationalities, but the Legation has reason to believe that at least a third of the number consisted of West Africans, British- and French-protected persons. Last year (see paragraph 181 of last year's report) the figure 891 given in the Saudi returns referred only to pilgrims who had entered the country through the port of Jedda; the additional figure of 1,259 was the Saudi estimate of West Africans of all nationalities who entered the country through the smaller Asiri and Hejazi ports south of Jedda. Of the total number of West Africans who entered the country during the period under review, probably not more than 40 per cent, were British or British-protected. 198. The problem of the disposal of some 1,500 British West African destitutes (see paragraph 184 of last year's report) was eventually solved after protracted correspondence between this Legation and the Governments concerned, and a total of 1.491 destitutes was repatriated between the 4th November, 1934, and the 10th February, 1935. 199. Lp to the time of writing this report no further applications for assistance to leave the country have been received. This satisfactory state of affairs is not surprising in view of {a) the void created in the local Takruni world as a result of the recent mass repatriation; (h) the greatly improved condition of the local labour market, with the subsequent demand for cheap Takruni labour; and (c) of the reports, if correct, of a large number of Takruni pilgrims who were unable to pay the Saudi quarantine dues at Qunfida, Lith and other ports and were turned back. 200. The present position with regard to the vexed question of dhow traffic iiom Massawa is somewhat obscure. But in the light of information volunteered by three Takrunis who had recently landed at Qunfida, it would appear that the Itahan authorities were making some attempt, though feeble, to control the tramc. bo far as could be ascertained, the system of control seems limited to the compulsory purchase of return tickets by all pilgrims proceeding to Heiaz by A return ticket between Massawa and Qunfida is said to cost 160 P.T.E. Ihe Saudis, however, have maintained the lively interest, evinced for the first mie last year, m restricting the traffic. All pilgrims arriving at Qunfida, Lith oi othei small ports south of Jedda were required to pay quarantine and other ues, amounting to 180 P.T.E. each, for which an official receipt was given, e oie tney disembarked; those who were unable to pay were immediately turned31 201. Only fifty-eight pilgrims travelled under the Nigerian Pilgrimage Scheme this year, compared with sixty-nine last year, all of whom arrived in this country in time to perform the pilgrimage. By the 6th June all but one had collected their return tickets and the sums due to them, and all but two had left the country by the 10th June, 1935. The scheme, which worked smoothly this year, must be accounted a complete success so far as this Legation is concerned, and it is to be hoped that, when its benefits become more widely appreciated and the increasing difficulties and expense of the Massawa route known, a greater number of pilgrims will be induced to take advantage of its benefits next year. 202. The Amir of Kazaure and party arrived in Jedda en route for Mecca on the 27th February. Whilst in Mecca he ran short of funds and was advanced the sum of £20 by the Legation. (14) Somali Pilgrimage. 203. According to Saudi returns, thirty-seven Somalis of all nationalities entered this country through the port of Jedda this year, as compared with fifty-two in 1934. Probably not more than fifteen of them were British-protected persons. No figures are available regarding those who came overland via Qunfida and Lith. - tit - i 204. The only advance made to a Somali this year was to bheikh Ismail Ishaak, Dolbahanta Muhammad Musa, Sheikh of Salehia Tarika, Suksodi.^ 206.

Official returns published by the Saudi authorities show that 866 Sudanese pilgrims disembarked at Jedda this year, an incr e ase year's figure of 534. They were, as usual, carried to and from the Hejaz by s p of the Khedivial Mail Line.

(16) Zanzibari and East A frican Pilgrimages. 211. Returns published by the Saudi authorities show that 139 Zanzibari and East Africans entered the country via the port of Jedda this year, an increase of 112 on last year's figure of twenty-seven. 212. No Zanzibari or East African pilgrim applied for repatriation this year. (17) South African Pilgrimage. 213. According to Saudi returns, fifty-nine pilgrims arrived in Jedda from South Africa, a decrease of thirty-nine on last year's figure of ninety-eight. The large majority of these pilgrims were, as usual, people of substance, who made their way unostentatiously in and out of the country. 214. A case has been reported of an Italian ship bringing pilgrims from South Africa and Zanzibar in 1934 evading calling at Kamaran for quarantine purposes. The matter is still the subject of enquiry. 215. Repatriation of South Africans :— (a) Applications considered deserving of examination : 1. {h) Applicants repatriated : 1. {c) Applications still under reference : Nil. (18) Palestinian and Transjordan Pilgrimage. • 216. Statistics published by the Saudi authorities show that 1,432 Palestinian and Transjordanian pilgrims entered the country through the ports of Yanbu and Jedda. This figure, incidentally, corresponds with the total number (1,420 Palestinians and twelve Transjordanians) given by the Palestine Government as having registered with the Palestine Health Department as intending pilgrims. The figure probably constitutes a record, and shows a notable increase over last year's figure of 377. 217. In accordance with past procedure (see paragraph 214 of last year s report) the Government of Palestine seconded an official, Suleyman Effendi Dashan, a clerk in the employ of the Department of Health at Gaza, for service with the Legation for a period of six weeks. He arrived in Jedda on the 11th March and proceeded to Mecca on pilgrimage, eventually reporting for duty at the Legation on the morning of the 20th March. He performed his duties conscientiously and efficiently, and was of great assistance to the pilgrims themselves. His services were highly appreciated by the officer under whom he worked. It was found possible to dispense with his services on the 22nd April, when he left Jedda for Palestine. 218. It is worthy of mention that the circular (see paragraph 213 of report for 1933) published and distributed by the Government of Palestine, advising intending pilgrims in their own interests to conform with official regulations, has achieved a fair measure of success in reducing the tendency of poor pilgrims to proceed on pilgrimage overland. Only fourteen members of this fraternity applied to the Legation for assistance. Three of them were natives of Trans jordan, who, after an unfruitful wait of four days, decided to return by the overland route. Of the remaining eleven destitutes, five were assisted by mutawwifs, through the good offices of Suleyman Effendi Dashan, and six were repatriated in the usual manner on the 8th May. 219. In spite of the somewhat higher cost of living, according to some reports, during the pilgrimage and later, relatively few applications for refunds were received during the return season. After the usual process of elimination, 196 pilgrims were each advanced the sum of £4. 220. Shipping arrangements worked smoothly this year, and there were no complaints from north-bound pilgrims. ! S33 221. A notable who performed the pilgrimage this year was Sheikh Muhammad Abdurrahim Beidas, M.B.E. He was in possession of a letter of recommendation from his Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine, and was afforded all possible assistance. (19) Pilgrimages of Adenese and Natives of the Aden Protectorate. 222. According to Saudi returns, 284 Hadhramis and natives of the Aden Protectorate came on pilgrimage by sea this year (port or ports of entry not given; probably refers only to Jedda). This figure does not include those who travelled by dhow and entered the country via the ports of Qunfida and Lith. The figures given in the Saudi returns for these ports are 285 via Qunfida and sixteen via Lith. Both figures come under the vague headings, Pilgrims who came via Qunfida' and 'Pilgrims who came via Lith.' It is impossible to submit an accurate estimate of Hadhramis and Adenese included in the above figures, but it seems doubtful whether they would exceed more than one-third of the total. No reliable information is available regarding those who came overland. 223. Shipping facilities to Aden and Mokalla were adequate this year. The two Besse Line steamers made frequent, though irregular, calls throughout the return season. 224. The steady exodus of Hadhramis of the semi-settled class, which commenced in 1932, continues. Between the 21st March, the beginning of the return season, and the 30th June, emergency travel documents were issued to 212 Hadhramis in this category, as compared with 270 last year (see para graph 209 of last year's report). It is estimated that at least half of those who came on pilgrimage through the port of Jedda this year have already returned. 225. A prominent notable of the Aden Protectorate who performed the pilgrimage this year was Sultan Muhammad Ji bil, Regent of the Audhali Sultan. He was' in possession of a letter of recommendation, and all possible assistance was given him. 226.

(b) Applicants repatriated : None. \c) Applicants assisted : 28. (20) Muscati, Bahreini and Koweiti Pilgrimages. 227. Statistics published by the Saudi authorities again do not differentiate between pilgrims from the above Sheikhdoms and Sultanate of the Arabian shmes of the Persian Gulf, eighty-nine of whom are recorded as having entered the port of Jedda on pilgrimage this year, as compared with seventy-nine last year 228 Although no figures are available it may he safely assumed that a mu larger number travelled overland. According to an extract from the KoweU Intelligence Summary, some 1.000 pilgrims left Koweit on the fist Januw) J. camel en route for Mecca via Bnrayda, being exempted, as aheady noted A^S^te wh^performed'the pilgrimage this year was Sheikh Juma- bm-Maktum, brother of this Ruler of Dibai.

Copy No. / Jedda, January 10, 1937. formation of a National First-Aid Society was reported in Mr. Calvert's despatch No. 267 of the 28th September, 1935. Since that date its progress has been slow and somewhat uncertain, but from fairly frequent notices in the Saudi press it has been evident that, despite some initial set-backs, the central committee has been active in promoting the objects of the society, principally in Mecca. A branch was formed in Medina in April 1936, but attempts to establish one in Jedda have so far come to nothing, although Sheikh Muhammad Surur is reported to have lent his influential support. 2. In Mecca, where the organisation has been promised annual financial support by the King, the Amir Feisal, Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman and others, volunteers and donations have been called for, and, according to the Indian medical officer of the Legation, a promising start appears to have been made. Premises have been secured in the Haram itself and certain essentials of equip ment installed. It is stated that two motor cars, one motor cycle and several bicycles, equipped with simple first-aid outfits, are attached to this post, which consists of several rooms (one for minor operations), offices and a small lecture- room. Dr. Abdul Hamid was impressed with the cleanliness and neatness of what he saw. 3. Funds are derived not only from donations, but from a special stamp duty of \ piastre levied on all letters sent through the Saudi post. The society's plans are reported to include the establishment of a hospital in Mecca 'and the completion of the hospital at Taif, which has been for some considerable time under construction. These plans are somewhat ambitious in comparison with the society's modest resources, but it is reasonable to hope that the society will be able to render useful assistance to the Public Health authorities during the forthcoming pilgrimage season. 4.

Ethiopian pllgriras in the Heja: // ^ • Al '* 1 3479 12905 (2)[E WOl 120X125 Copy (Received February 22.) Sir R. Bullard to Mr. Eden.- (No. 16.) Sir, Jedda, January 30, 1937. I HAVE the honour to inform you that the Umm-al-Qura of the 22nd January contains an article refuting an allegation published in an Egyptian newspaper that the kissing of the Black Stone which is* built into the wall of the shrine at Mecca is forbidden. According to the Umm-al-Qura, a certain Abdul Ghani Salama, writing in the Jihad of the 2nd January, states that pilgrims are prohibited, in defiance of certain traditions which he quotes, from kissing or touching or prostrating themselves before the Black Stone, and are beaten by the police with sticks if they disregard the prohibition. The Umm-al-Qura declares the accusation to be unfounded, quotes the Grand Qadhi of Mecca as himself citing with approval the traditions mentioned by Abdul Ghani, and maintains that many pilgrims touch every corner of the shrine; still more, it says, must they be allowed to touch the Black Stone. The article ends with the reproduction of a statement of the Pilgrimage Propaganda Committee, denying the allegation, and attributing it to the fact that policemen are posted within the precincts of the mosque to protect pilgrims and their property and to control the crowds, and that, in view of the particularly dense crowd which collects round the Black Stone, a policeman is stationed there to prevent congestion and to arrange for people to kiss the stone without disputing with one another. 2. The kissing of the Black Stone by Mahomet is recorded in traditions which are accepted by the Wahabis, who have, therefore, made no change in the practice in this respect. The police are obliged, however, to control the crowds, which would otherwise become unmanageable, and for this purpose they move on, sometimes with violence, pilgrims who linger too long at the stone and cause a crowd or give rise to disputes. I understand that at the height of the pilgrim season pilgrims performing the ' tawwaf ' or sevenfold circuit of the shrine are not allowed to kiss the stone each time they pass it, as many would like to do, but only when they reach it for the seventh time. The Indian vice-consul attached to the Legation, who has seen every pilgrimage since the Wahabi conquest of Mecca, supports the view that no restriction has ever been placed on the kissing of the stone, but adds that during the more crowded days of the pilgrimage the police, whose business it is to control the crowds, doubtless use their sticks freely on the heads of the pilgrims, and that this may have given rise to a belief that the kissing of the stone was prohibited. 3. The fact that the kissing of the Black Stone is allowed is not to be taken, therefore, as a sign of a change in W^ahabi policy. That theie is slight change in the direction of toleration is, however, well known. You have been informed from time to time of the growing use of gramophones and wireless apparatus, and of the cessation of the campaign against smoking. I am informed that, whereas in the earlv days after the Wahabi conquest pilgrims who showed particular respect to'the tomb of the Prophet at Medina were liable to be beaten or at least driven away, they can now reach, and even kiss, the railing round it at the cost of a small tip to the police on duty. The authorities recently stated that they proposed to build a library on the site of the building which marked the traditional birthplace of the Prophet until the AVahabis destioyed it, but this statement was made bv wav of reply to a wealthy Indian who asked foi permission to build a mosque there, and there is no news yet that the project is being- carried out. In anv case, the library would not be constructed as a memorial; but it would remove one cause of pain to the devotee, who at present g00g the site defiled by the presence of camels and dogs. [931 y—1]2 4. In one respect there is no relaxation of Puritan strictness. The visiting- of graves is still forbidden. The authorities in Jedda recently found that visits to the grave of an alleged saint (a Yemeni), which were discontinued after the Wahabi conquest of the Hejaz, were being resumed. They removed the remains to the general cemetery, and destroyed every trace of the building under which they had lain. But it is not even permitted to visit the graves of relatives and friends. Mine. Palsay, the wife of the Turkish Charge d Affaires in Jedda, died a few weeks ago and was buried in a Moslem cemetery, and when M. Palsay went there the following day to see the grave he was stopped by an armed sentry, who explained that no one was allowed to visit a grave. M. Palsay has now obtained an authorisation to enter the cemetery whenever he wishes; but Wahabi opposition to the custom which the Turks share with most other races, of placing some distinguishing mark upon a grave, makes it impossible, M. Palsay believes, for the authorities to give him permission, if he should apply for it, to raise a' stone on the grave to the memory of his wife. Rather than ask for a favour ( which he believes must be refused he has decided, perhaps not altogether wisely, to place upon the grave, secretly, a stone so small and unobtrusive that the authorities may feel justified in ignoring its existence. 5.

[E 1639/201/25j Section 4. Copy No R. Bullard to Mr. Eden.—{Received March 22.) Sir, Jedda, March 4, 1937. ANY Moslems who expected that the pilgrimage would be made the occasion either for the holding of a Moslem congress or for some less formal demonstration of politico-religious solidarity will have been disappointed. In my telegram No. 11, which I had the honour to address to you on the 25th February, I conveyed a message from Ibn Saud, in which he stated that in reply to an appeal for help from the Mufti of Palestine he had advised the mufti to await the finding of the Royal Commission and to co-operate with the Palestine authorities in the maintenance of law and order. According to my information the mufti did not make any political speech throughout the pilgrimage, not even at the meeting of the Saudi Arab \ oung Men's Society at Muna, at which he was a guest. The published report of this meeting represents the mufti as having been called upon for a speech after a long series of other persons had either made speeches or recited verses, and as having spoken on ' Islam and Modern Civilisation.' It would be quite easy to make a violent speech about Palestine which would fit this title, but 1 am assured that the speech was non-political. 2. It had been Ibn Saud's custom for some years to give a dinner of about a thousand covers to the leading men from the^ various countries represented at the pilgrimage. This year he gave four separate banquets for : (1) Indians; (2) Egyptians; (3) 'pilgrims from the Arab countries'; and (4) 'pilgrims from various countries.' The newspaper report mentions as among the ' various countries ' China, the Sudan, and North, South and East Africa. The Malays and Javanese are not mentioned, but it seems that, in fact, very few of these pilgrims attend the Royal banquets. It is alleged that they are not remunerative as guests, because they never make speeches praising Ibn Saud and do not write him up when they get back to their own countries. The reason given in the press for the division of the pilgrims into groups is that it gave the King an opportunity to get into closer touch with them. The innovation would clearly have that effect, but the splitting up of the pilgrims by countries would also make it more difficult for a hot-headed speaker to make a pan-Islamic appeal, and this consideration may have helped to influence Ibn Saud's decision. 3. A striking feature of the pilgrimage was Ibn Saud's endeavour to convince the Moslem world of his orthodoxy. According to the published version of the speech which he delivered at the Indian banquet, after speaking as he has done every year about Allah and the Prophet and the Koran he said :— '' As to the prescriptions of the sects, we are not against them in anything. They are all our sects, whether Hanafi, or Shafai, or Maliki, or Hanbali. Our sect is based on proof wherever it may be found [i.e., in the Koran or the traditions of the Prophet], and if proof is lacking and there is nothing to follow but ' ijtihad ' [deduction or interpretation by a person of learning], then we follow the ' ijtihad ' of Ahmad-bin-Hanbal.' A similar statement was made by the King in the course of a private interview which he gave to His Highness the Khan of Kelat. According to Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, the Indian vice-consul, who was present, the King declared that he was a Hanbali, but that he respected the other three founders of the Sunni sects and had adopted various points from their teachings. It does not appear from the published reports that the King made similar declarations on any other occasion, but the publication in the Umm-al-Qura of the declaration made at the Indian banquet shows that it was not intended merely for Indian consumption. [956 y—4]4. Ibn Baud's interest in the pilgrimage, which is none the less sincerely religious for being necessarily financial, must itself dispose him to be conciliatory towards Moslems who might question his orthodoxy. This year, however, he may have wished to give a particularly marked religious turn to his public utterances because of the attempts which he knew were being made to make political capital out of the pilgrimage. He had to deal not only with the Mufti of Palestine, but also with the pilgrims subsidised by General Franco and by the Italian authorities, about whom I am reporting separately. 5.
