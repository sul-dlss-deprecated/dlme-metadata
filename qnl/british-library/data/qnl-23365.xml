From The Acting Adviser to the G-overnment of Bahrain, Bahrain. I have the honour to enquire when the Bahrain Government can expect to receive the re port of Khan Bahadur M. Fateh-ud-Bin, M.B.E., I.A.S., the agricultural expert who was lent by the Government of India. The Bahrain Government spent a very con siderable sum of money on acquiring the services of Khan Bahadur M. Faleh-ud-Bin and wishes t&lt;D profit materially from his advice. Until his report on possibilities of agriculture in Bahrain is received.very little work can be undertaken^ in this direction;and the season for planting in Bahrain is now commencing. Khan Bahadur M. Fateh-ud-Bin spent 69 days in Bahrain during which time he made a very tho rough inspection of the islands;but apart from giving general advice to numerous cultivators on individual problems, he has not presented any de finite suggestions for developing cultivation or for introducing new crops etc. Khan Bahadur stated that he would incor porate his observations and suggestions in the form of a report^and it is this report which the Bahrain Government urgently desires to obtain.

It is now close on five months since the Khan Bahadur left Bahrain and there is no little comment in Bahrain on the delay which has occurred in sending his report* Quite frankly I shrink from making further demands until I am in a position to promise some result. I am sure you will agree with me that there are the best possible reasons for doing all we can to ensure that there is no further extension of the extraordinary delay which has occurred already, and the unofficial adoption of a sort of C.O.D. system seems as likely as anything to produce results.

In the interest of the work I consider that I should spend some $ brief periods at certain date-growing centres, such as Egypt, Jerusalem, Baghdad, Basra, etc. to obtain all available information possible about the date-palm pests and about appropriate methods of treatment, if any. I uould perform this journey during my leave period, and would thus arrive in Baiiraiiion tne expirty of my leave in January 1939. According to the evidence at my disposal here, that would be the best time 9 ' at which the work should be commenced. (2) That adequate equipment my be supplied to me in Bahrain on my arrival there. Bhould I receive the final decision requiring me to go to Bahrain, I could submit a list of the apparatus and insecticides likely to be necessary. If you like I coula see Mr. Belgrave, Adviser to Baiirain Government in England, before I leave London, as attested in one of your letters. I hope that he may be able to make some arrangements for the purchase of some light spraying machine (which could be easily carried on the back of a person who could w climb the date-palm tree and then spray the inflorescence).

Sir, With reference to your letter No. F.442-N/3Q dated -he 3rd November 1938, I am directed to forward herewith Khan Bahadur Maulvi Fateh-ud-Din’s report on the agricultural development of Bahrain. The delay in its submission is greatly ^ regretted and is due to a chain of unfortunate circunistances which could not well have been foreseen. 2. The first difficulty was the soil of Bahrain. This is apparently of such a peculiar nature, that the Khan Bahadur considered it impossible to write his report until it had been J analysed. Frr this purpose he had a large number of samples collected for analysis by Dr. Lander, the Agricultural Chemist if to Government, Punjab. These samples were despatched from Bahrain after his departure and unfortunately arrived in Lyallpur (Dr.Lander’s headquarters) in so unsatisfactory a condition that it was difficult to identify them without a map showing where they came from. This necessitated a referen ce to Bahrain, and the map was not received until September or October. Meanwhile famine had broken out in the south-east Punjab and the Khan Bahadur pas placed on special duty as Fodder Controller. Since then he has been unceasingly absorbed in work of an urgent and arduous character which, till the rains broke and the famine become less acute, left him no time to write his report. Ill health in March and April was a/-i a further complication. The Punjab Government regrets extremely the inconvenience that the great delay must have caused the Bahrain Government.

Considering that out of a report extending to 39 pages only two pages are devoted to comments on soil analysis I cannot feel that the first excuse holds * much water. As for the rest, it was of course unfortunate that the Khan Bahadur had to go on famine relief duty but that is of little interest to the Bahrain Government whose money has been wasted. 1 might add that I urged the Khan Bahadur, when he left Bahrain, to write the body of his report before he re-assumed charge of his duties in the Punjab. 4. I had indeed at one time considered submitting a request for the refund of a part of the sum which the Bahrain Government have already paid, but this might lead Alead to an undue volume of correspondence which is most undesirable In present circumstances* and I suggest there fore that we should content ourselves with asking the Government of India to arrange for the withdrawal of the present claim on account of leave and pension contributions Yours sincerely f1 J Confidential ?

The passports were examined by myself and Shaikhs Abdulin and Sulman and it was decided that they could not be used. At the same time we examined a Muscat and Oman passport of a type which has been in use for some time and discovered that this passport also contained the swastikas design.
