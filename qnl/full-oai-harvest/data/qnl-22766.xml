It explains that as a result of his visit, he considers it extremely unlikely that Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd, the Imam of Muscat, will provide assistance to any expedition the Persians may launch against Bahrain; the Resident now considers it unlikely that the Persians will attack Bahrain at all.It further reports that the Shaikh of Bushire, who was at Muscat at the time, was entirely occupied with securing a retreat in case he should incur the displeasure of the Government of Shiraz, regardless of what his official instructions actually were.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054362.0x000070#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
