Shahzada’s Return Journey, Marseilles to Suez. Sir Gerald Fitzgerald to India Office. India Office, 9th November 1895. 1 have the honour to report, for the information of the Secretary of State, that I have returned to England after leaving His Highness the Shahzada Nasrullah Khan at Suez. 2. I have already informed Mr. Neel of all that occurred at Paris, and do not propose in this report to refer to anything anterior to our departure from Marseilles on the 19th September. The three points which I kept in view during the subsequent time were,— 1st. That the “Clive” should not go to Yembo. I thought—1st, that His Highness’ landing under cover of the Government flag implied, whatever we might say to the contrary, quasi-protection ; 2nd, that, if accompanied by his armed followers, some of whom were disciplined troops, it would place the Government in a difficult position with the Turkish Government and possibly lead to serious complications, unless indeed the Sultan’s consent was previously obtained, which 1 knew would not be accorded. 2nd. That the Shahzada should be treated as absolutely independent, and that there should not be the slightest semblance of pressure or exercised authoritv. . 3rd. To induce His Highness, if possible, to abandon the visit to Medina. I knew that the country round Yembo was in a disturbed state, that the Turkish authority did not practically extend beyond the walls of Jeddah, that His Highness proposed to take with him two lakhs in specie as a gift to the shrine, which would indubitably have proved too strong a bait to be resisted by Bedouin tribes, and that collisions would have ensued, which would probably have resulted in the Afghans being defeated. 3. For some little time after I arrived on board at Marseilles I had not the slightest idea as to the immediate destination of the ship, whether Civita Vecchia or Port Said. His Highness then said that he had given up the idea of going to Home, but wished to touch at Naples. As this could be done within the time allowed by the Secretary of State, orders w r ere given in accordance with His Highness’s wishes. 4. I had considerable anxiety at this period, and indeed throughout the passage, as there had been a good deal of sickness among the crew, with some deaths previously, and on the evening we left Marseilles we had to heave to to bury two more who had died that morning. We had many sick on board. I could not tell how far the malady would spread, and the Shahzada and his people were uneasy, a condition conducive to susceptibility to illness. Sickness was however confined to the crew up to the time I quitted the ship at Suez, where we buried another man. 5. We arrived at Naples with the yellow flag flying early in the morning of Saturdav, 21st September. That evening Sir Acquin Martin came to my cabin aiid said that the Shahzada wished to go by train to Rome the next day. He assured me that all idea of a visit to Medina, or detention in Egypt, had been abandoned, and further, that if revived he would not only not assist, but would say that he would have nothing to do with it, would withdraw from all connection with His Highness, and proceed straight to India. This should he remembered in connection with what afterwards took place in Egypt. S. 70. Aminimize the 6. There were many considerations that weighed with me, 1st. I was anxious to meet His Highness’s wishes, and to 2 n d m AfTer E c S ou 1 sult;ng tl,o captain, I found that, allowing for every possible “ delay, the ship could still arrive at Kurrachee by loth October. 3rd. That the ship’s water had to be analyzed on account of the sickness on board, the time necessary for which was somewhat indefinite, and I thought that it was as well that the Shahzada should be absent. 7. I therefore consented, making it clear that the Government would not r,™ fra- the snecial trains, &amp;c. I went to Rome myself, the other officers remaining in the ship, as I could not be certain otherwise of His Highness returning within the time allowed and I considered that I was bound to do o under the instructions I had received as to Pans, which seemed applicable pari passu to Home. 8 Our ambassador was absent, so that the difficulty which had occurred in dirt not arise. His Highness enjoyed his visit, and we returned to Naples late on Wednesday the 25th September. The “ Clive ’’ sailed that night for^Port Said direct, where we arrived on Monday morning, 30th Septembei, between 9 and 10 a.m. 9 A telegram from the Amir was waiting for the Shahzada, which he mter- nreted as an order from his father to go to Mecca and Medina. (This was 5 i o nrd-prt 'Frudosure No 1) As far as I could learn it was nothing of the ^ one His Highness sent from Paris, in which he 1 proposed tolhartcT a ship, if procurable, to proceed to Yembo, as the “ Thvp 1 ’’ was urgently required at Kurrachee. It did not, I believe, entei into lhe sanitary conditions of the country or the feasibility of the journey, i • i 'innnrpntlv the Amir considered that the Shahzada would be guide'dby^he information be obtained in Egypt. The Shahzada afterwards appeared to accept this view of the Amir’s intentions. 10 T had bad the ship coaled at Naples, so as to enable her to run through to A Vn wTthout stoppiL, and had hoped, after what Sir A. Martin had told me to enter the Canal by noon. Sir A. Martin, however, after the receipt of the Amir’s telegram, went on shore to make inquiries as to the possibility of chartering a steamer, and we did not enter the Canal until the late afternoon. 11 The Senior Naval Officer at Port Said having repeated to me the report clothe state of things at Jeddah, brought by H.M.S. “ Scout,” winch had as to the st£ t „ passed through Port Said that morning, I at once telegraphed* to Lord Cromer for authentic information as to Yembo and tho route to Medina. 12. On the return on board of Sir A. touna tnaimrn. xaiuu. had been converted to the idea of the “Clive” touching at Yembo, as there was no ship available at lortbaid, and had telegraphed to India for instructions (the telegram was shown me) I at once reported to the India Office, expressing my view as to the dan s ei of touching^at Yembo, and pointing out the necessity ol one authority, “ England or India ” (Enclosures Nos. 1 and 2). 13 In the passage between Port Said and Ismailia Sir A. Talbot reported to me on the authorfty of Sir A. Martin, that the Shahzada was prepared to dispense with Turkish escort and proposed to take his own armed tollowers. Erom the latter place I reported this as well as my answer to His Highness s request that the “ Clive ” should take him to Yembo (Ao. 3.) 14 The “Clive” reached Suez about 11 on the morning of luesday, 1st October and from that time until her departure my headquarters were practically at the Consulate, as she was lying five miles from the tov^n, Here was*great difficulty in getting telegrams delivered, and Lord Cromer had requested that the Foreign Office cipher should be used, of which we had • This is one of two telegrams missing from the accompanying file as it was sent in a great hurry through the Naval Ofncer. The replies are numbered 4 and 6. Martin, 1 found that Sir A. lalbot3 © no copy on board. I only returned on board at night to see the Shahzada if he wished it, and do any current work that there might be. 15. At this time I did not know that the Egyptian Government would interfere to prevent His Highness landing, and my object was to get the ship away in accordance with the Secretary of State’s orders, and at the same time to avoid any appearance of treating the Shahzada as otherwise than independent. I therefore told Sir A. Martin that I would keep the “ Clive ” three days, which I could do under my instructions (reported to Mr. Neel, No. 7). I at the same time informed Lord Cromer fully as to the position (No. 5). 16. Sir A. Martin proceeded to Cairo the same afternoon to make inquiries as to chartering a ship, telling me that he was obliged to do so to satisfy His Highness, but that he would do everything in his power to stop such a step being taken. Erom that time I heard nothing from him until his return to the ship the day she sailed, except one telegram postponing the date of his • No gs arrival (No. 19), and one letter* which is appended to this report. 17. After his departure, Sir A. Talbot received a telegram from the Govern ment of India in reply to his, giving permission for the “ Clive ” to touch at Ycmbo. This I treated as being superseded by the instructions of the Secretary of State (reported No. 8). Sir A. Talbot telegraphed accordingly to the Government of India, and later received a wire sent upon receipt 3 of No. 11, repeated to India, cancelling former instructions. He received another from India later still ordering him not to leave Suez without instructions. He told me the contents of these telegrams, but I did not see them, and the last was never mentioned again. 18. On the morning of 2nd October I had the first intimation that the Egyptian Government would object to the Shahzada landing, when Lord Cromer telegraphed that no armed party or ammunition on a considerable scale could be landed at Suez without the permission of the Egyptian Government, which was not likely to be granted without reference to Constantinople. He added, “ Prince should not be allowed to carry out his proposal on no distinct authority from England ” (No. 9). I had received the India Office telegram, No. 10, ordering distinctly that the “Clive” should go to Kurrachee, and that if His Highness insisted on visiting either Mecca or Medina he should leave her at Suez and make his own arrangements. I felt on every ground that any objection, if objection there was, should come from the Egyptian and not 'the English Government, and I accordingly replied, “ No question of distinct authority from England, must be treated as absolutely independent,” and quoted instructions that if His Highness insisted on visiting either Mecca or Medina he should quit the “ Clive ” at Suez. I added “ Sir A. Martin in Cairo to-day, not to be trusted ” .(No. 12). 19. I believed at the time that it was the latter’s interest not to charter a ship, and that he would work loyally, but I bad found on the passage that he was not to be relied upon, at any rate where judgment was required, and I did not think that he was quite the man to know all the details of a question which seemed likely to become a delicate one. 20. I must here premise with reference to what happened afterwards, that I being in Suez only know w T hat occurred in Cairo from the information contained in the annexed telegrams and what I subsequently heard on arrival there. I believe, however, that Lord Cromer has himseif reported to the Foreign Office. 21. This telegram (No. 12) was crossed by one from Lord Cromer informing me that the Minister for War had been applied to to let a steamer to take the Shahzada to Yembo, and emphatically impressing upon me the desirability of no action being taken until there had been time to communicate with London and Constantinople (No. 13). My reply was that the arms and ammunition were in my possession in the ship’s magazines, and that I had informed the Shahzada that I could not allow them to be landed without S. 70. A ?4 permission from the Customs authorities as compromising the flag. This the Shahzada understood and appreciated (No. 14.) 22 General Kitchener thinking that there was something wrong, as the application had not come through the Agency, informed Lord Cromer, who at once sent for Sir A. Martin. My telegram of the morning had reached m the meantime, and I very shortly had one which informed me of the result of the visit Sir A. Martin had accepted the advice given him, and acted upon it, viz., to apply to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for permission for the Shahzada to go to Cairo and land 60 men and 40 rifles with ammunition at Suez Lord Cromer had further advised the Foreign Minister to refer the matter to Constantinople and informed Sir A. Martin of the advice he had tendered. He ended by suggesting that the “ Clive ” should be detained for a few days, with a confidential hint that probably the Shahzada would not go to Yembo (No. 15). 23. Although contrary to the express orders of the Secretary of State, I considered that I was under the circumstances justified in accepting the responsibility, and wired at once “ Will detain ‘ Clive ’ ” (No. 17). I at the same time reported my action to the India Office giving my reasons viz., that as the Egyptian Government were objecting to the Shahzada s landing, it would have the appearance of taking him to India as a prisoner (No. IS). This is practically what we should have done had the “ Clive ” sailed under the then existing circumstances. What I wanted was that the Shahzada should himself give the order for sailing, and this was what I ultimately succeeded in obtaining. 24. The same night, 2nd October, I had a message from the Governor of Suez saying that he wished to see me if I would receive him. He came to the Consulate about midnight, and informed me that he had Jiad orders from the Foreign Minister that he was to telegraph to him any intention of the Shahzada to land men or arms, and to communicate the orders to me. This I reported to Lord Cromer in the same telegram (No. 17). 25. On the 3rd of October I was informed that, notwithstanding the arrange ment of the day before between Lord Cromer and Sir A. Martin, a special train was coming down that night to be placed at the disposal of the Shahzada to take him to Cairo at any hour he wished on the following day, and that orders had been received by the Customs Officer and Coastguard authorities from the Direction-General at Alexandria to pass all baggage, including arms and ammunition, without inspection. I thought at first that there must have been some mistake, and that the oiders must have been given anterior to Lord Cromer’s interview of the day before and not been countermanded. I therefore went to the station, and asked them to wire to Cairo and find out whether the train was really starting. I append the station master’s letter* in reply, * No 29 * giving the text of the repeated in structions. I then verified the report as to the Customs and Coastguard, and was shown the orders which had been telegraphed that day. 26. As soon as I had assured myself of the facts, I telegraphed to Lord Cromer informing him. I was determined at the same time that if the Egyptian Government objected to the Shahzada landing it should be cleai that it was their act and not that of the British Government, and that I would not be the executive officer to interfere. I therefore added that I could not well retain arms if Martin obtained Customs permit (No. -0). 27 All this caused considerable excitement in the place, as there were two sets of orders diametrically opposed, one to the Governor from the Foreign Minister, and the other to the Customs and Railway from the Central Administration at Alexandria, where the Khedive was The suspicion was that the last named emanated from His Highness himself, a suspicion shaied at first by Lord Cromer and myself. At eleven that night I saw the Governor who was much disturbed as to the course to pursue, as he did not wish to offend either the Khedive, if it was his act, ov the Foreign Minister. I pointed out that it was his responsibility not mine^ but that I would guarantee that no action would be taken until the following afternoon if lie0 would telegraph at once and clear the matter up. I added that if a permit to land arms and ammunition was produced I could do nothing, as His Highness the Shahzada was absolutely independent of any authority but that of his father the Amir. The telegram was duly sent. On the following morning Lord Cromer telegraphed that the execution of orders had been suspended pending reference to Boutras Pasha at Alexandria. He also said that the train had been ordered from Suez (No. 21). This he afterwards found was a mistake. 28. The explanation apparently is that Sir A. Martin, for some reason which I can only surmise, was determined to carry through the visit to Medina, notwithstanding what he had said to me. 'What we know is, that whilst accepting and ostensibly acting on Lord Cromer’s advice, he at the same time, without informing Lord Cromer, applied direct to the authorities at Alexandria, ordered the special train, and having failed to secure an Egyptian Government steamer, practically chartered the Peninsular and Oriental steamer “ Peshawur,” which happened to be lying idle in Bombay. His action was, of course, indefensible from our standpoint of loyalty and honesty, which were all the more incumbent upon him in the case of Her Majesty’s representative. At the same time, it is but fair to remember that he has had no opportunity of explaining his reasons for acting as he did, as the ship had sailed before the details were known. What appeared to make the case worse was that it was all done through Messrs. Cook, who have considerable influence with the officials in the country, and that Sir A. Martin actually had their representative in Egypt, Mr. Snow, with him when he called at the Agency, but objected to his being present at the interview. Lord Cromer did not know this at the time, or he would certainly, as he said afterwards, have sent for him to come in. Mr. Snow was afterwards, I believe, asked for an explanation, and it was decided that no blame attached to him, as he naturally inferred under the circumstances that Lord Cromer was cognizant of any steps that he was directed to take. 29. In the meantime, whilst all this was going on iu Cairo, the Shahzada began to waver in his determination to go to Medina, and on the afternoon of 3rd October telegraphed for Sir Ac quin to return at once. He arrived at Suez early on Eriday, and found waiting for him at the station the reply from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the effect that the Khedive could not allow the Shahzada to land with his suite until he had referred the request to Constantinople. I had had a copv of this late the ntoht before (No. 22). 30. At 11 a.m. the Shahzada sent for me and asked when the ship was to sail. I replied that that depended on His Highness’s wishes, as I had undertaken the responsibility of detaining her for a few days to enable him to receive an answer from Constantinople. He at once asked who had sent such a request, and said that if one was made it should come from him personally. I explained that Sir A. Martin had officially communicated on his behalf with His Highness the Khedive, who had considered it necessary to refer the matter to Constantinople, as he proposed going to Medina. * His Highness then said that he should like to start immediately for Kurrachee direct I gave the order for steam to be got up, and the “ Clive ” sailed at 11 p.m. 31. Lord Cromer and the India Office were at once informed, and I also tried to stop the communication to Constantinople, as the Shahzada seemed anxious on the subject (Nos. 23, 21, 25). Later in the day Lord Cromer * This is the other telegram missing from ^lepaphcf in ^P 1 ? to ' «P«?» ‘0 the the file. It was handed to the Shahzada and suanzaaa ins regret at having been not returned. unable to pay his respects to him whilst in Egpyt, wishing him a good passage and congratulating him on the wisdom of his decision. During the afternoon and evening His Highness was like a boy going on a holiday. He remarked that even the ship had her nose turned homeward which she had not the day before, and constantly asked the captain whether he could not make his old tin kettles boil any quicker.32. Sir A. Martin told me during the evening that he had given to the Shahzada as a reason for the difficulties that had occurred the strained * relations between England and Turkey. I pointed out that it was absolutely untrue, as it was clear from the Foreign Minister’s wire that no communi cation had yet been made to the Sultan. It had been intended that I should take a telegram on shore to send to the Amir, which I have no doubt contained this explanation, as the idea was abandoned after Sir A. Talbot had told Sir A. Martin that if any such explanation was sent to Kabul he should consider it his duty to inform the Government of India. On arrival at Cairo, after consultation with Lord Cromer, I thought it advisable to telegraph to Sir A. Talbot to Aden to impress upon the Shahzada that the difficulty really was making Egypt the base for landing an armed party on Turkish territory without the Sultan’s consent. Lord Cromer concurred in this telegram, and it was so stated (No. 27). I parted from the Shahzada the best of friends, when he gave me a small cigarette case. I cannot conclude without an acknowledgment of the great assistance I received from Captain Einny and the officers of the “ Clive.” We worked together most harmoniously from first to last, with the result that discipline was maintained and we never had a serious difficulty with the Afghans on board. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) G. S. V. FitzGerald. The Under Secretary of State for India. P.S. I think that it is as well perhaps to explain, with reference to Telegram 14 to Lord Cromer, that Captain Finny was my mouthpiece in communicating to His Highness the fact that the arms could ^ not be landed without the permission of the Customs authorities, as I wished it to be recognized that it was an ordinary regulation of the Port applicable to all ships, and in no way political or prompted by me. 18th November 1895.a No. 4.

This road is not unsafe, except that it is frequented by small bands of robbers, which armed escort of Mahmal was sufficient to overcome. Same is case on Medina-Mecca road.

Cairo, My dear Sir Gerald, 2nd October 1895. I saw Lord Cromer to-day at his Lordship’s request. On his advice I have wired to the Khedive, who has in turn wired to the Sultan (on advice also of Lord Cromer). Lord Cromer asks me to remain here pending receipt of Sultan’s reply, in case further reference should be necessary, and this I propose to do, and will in any case return the day after to-morrow. While writing I receive your wire of date informing me that Secretary of State has cabled confirming orders for ship’s departure according to your original instructions. This makes date of leaving Suez 28th September + a week = 5th October. If, therefore, I return on 4th instant (as above mentioned) I shall be well within your instructions.

The report concerns Shahzada Nasrulla Khan of Afghanistan and his return trip from England following a state visit during the summer of 1895; the focus of the report is the part of the journey between Marseilles and Suez, which was undertaken aboard HMS
                           Clive.The report briefly mentions an outbreak of sickness among the crew of HMS
                           Clive, and a brief visit made to Rome at the Shahzada's request. However, the main focus is on the measures taken during the trip by Sir William Fitzgerald to — successfully — dissuade Nasrulla Khan from making a trip to Mecca and Medina. This includes preventing the ship from touching at Yembo [Yanbuʻ al-Baḥr] and issues surrounding Nasrulla Khan disembarking at Suez; these issues relate to objections from the Egyptian authorities to the Shahzada landing with a group of armed followers.Appended to the report is a list of relevant telegrams from the aforementioned voyage between 30 September 1895 and 4 October 1895. The principal correspondents are Sir William Fitzgerald, Lord Cromer [Evelyn Baring], and Edmund Neel (Assistant Secretary to the Political and Secret Department at the India Office).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Afghanistan</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HMS Clive, Indian troopship</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Egypt</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Aide-de-Camp to the Secretary of State for India</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Assistant Secretary to the Political and Secret Department,</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000788.0x0002cc#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
