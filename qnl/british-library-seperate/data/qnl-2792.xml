From the beginning of January 1941 to the end of May 1941 the reports are weekly. From June 1941 they become monthly. The reports are composed by the Resident Adviser, based in Mukalla.Each report consists of an update on the political and tribal affairs of the statelets that make up the Eastern Aden Protectorate, including:the Qu'aiti State of Shihr and Mukalla;the Kathiri State of Seiyun;the Mahri Sultanate of Qishn and Sokotra;the Wahidi Sultanate of Bir Ali and Balihaf;the Shaikhdom of Irqa and Haura;the Indeterminate Area.News from neighbouring countries such as Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and the Western Aden Protectorate was also sometimes included.From April 1942 the reports expand and include important summarised information on finances, education, medical matters, food security, shipping, military and naval matters, agriculture and fisheries, meteorology, internal security, the effects of the war, and slavery.Most likely due to shortages of paper during the war, the reports are sometimes printed on the back of old documents and maps, including a map of Britain and Europe showing an idealised interpretation of Britain's targets and progress in the Second World War. The title ('Britain - The Spear of Attack') and labels are written in Arabic. There is also a page of text referring to a map of shipping routes (not present) and promoting the work of the Royal Navy and its allies. It is likely these were used as propaganda to garner support in the Arab Middle East.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Yemen</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Hadhramaut</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000152#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
