I have had under ooneiderat ion the oourse to be adopted if, as a result of the withdrawal of the Indo-European Telegraph Department and the ineffioienoy of the Persian Telegraph .dmiaietration, it beoomee essential to seek some alternative method of rapid ooaarrunioation with His Wajstty’s Legation. It wDuld seem poeulble to arran e with the Imperial Uoromunloat ions loinpany Limited that telegram addressed to you should be tent by them to Bushire and thanoe forwarded to Tehran by the Junkers air service, wMoh, i understand, provides two flights every week in eanh direotion between Tehran and Bushire. It w nia similarly seem possible for you to arrange for the figures of oode and oypher tele rams to ba transmitted by air to B-ehire, possibly addressed to His Maj esty's 1 onsu 1.

It might be well worth our while to se^d copies of non-confidential telegrams (either poot copies or groups) by the air mail from Bushire to Tehran, as Simpson suggests. But, having regard to the fact that the carrying agency would not be under British control, tsone difficulty might be felt about adopting the same course in the case of telegrams in cypher. , (Sgd.)

No. 8. (R) Minister for Foreign Affairs asked me to come and see him yesterday for the purpose of discussing telegraphs He began by pointing out that in his letter of October 1st Sir R, Clive proposed an 'accord final' and later hinted at a reference to settlement of telegraphs question in an article of general treaty. Minister for Foreign Affairs seemed to think if en agreement w&amp;re made now it would be unnecessary to refer to the matter again in general treaty though Persian Government would be prepared to do so if we desired it. Ho enquired what foim agreement should take. Would we submit a draft or should he? He then referred to sentence stating that in final agreement a dense should be inserted whereby Jask Gwadur line end cable stations should continue to be administered by a British organisation. He said the Persian Government could not engage themselves for an indefinite period but would be prepared to allow control till 1945. I informed Minister for Foreign Affairs that I would prefer to request instructions before pursuing the matter further.

Director of Indo-European Telegraph Department has approached Minister of Posts in the sense suggested and offered oo lend him some of his operators. Minister de murred and said he had already more staff than he wanted. He promised however to put his best operators on lega tion and departmental telegrams. Director informs me that there are at least six efficient workers who have previously served under Depart- menu, so it seems possible that service may be satisfac- uor^. In any case I do not think that we can expect to get more facilities. In the course of conversation on the subject of staff reQuirements Minister adverted to proposal for through line to Europe through Russia. He admitted that he had oeen in pour parlers with Soviet Embassy on the subject. Representative of Indo-European Telegraph Company fnfcmed me that Minister has also mentioned matter to him, cut that he is personally of opinion that project is unlikely co be followed up for the following reasons; (1) that traffic would be insufficient to make it pay, or even occupy staff, (2) that it would compete with Persian wireless.

Of the four oolnwS raised we are, of course, unable to re-'ly In detail to the ’ Irat, haring no adequate Knowledge of the condition© obtaining In Afghanistan and China. ^e cannot institute a comper'son, and raust plead the case of this Legation on its own merits. But X submit that in point of f^ct conditions here must he uni uely unfavourable. There are two min factors' general inefficiency of the public services and the use of an alphabet differing entirely from curs. As to the first, Persia can have fow rivals} as to the second. Chins and / fghanlsten would appear to be the only other countries where this factor applies, (eoart from v etly mere efficient States such as Russia and Japan), Kvcn in 1 eking the analogy is not vary exact. The Foreign Office tell us that the Legation there has lie o*n wireless, so that the reception of telegrams is on an altogether different basis. Moreover In Peking I undcrat nd that a sneclal cypher offiear detailed from the Cornmu ilcationa Beparta( 2 nt is permanently employed. Buch an officer has, by many years of practice, gained something of the cryptographer’s skill In decyphement, whereas the C pher Officer at this Legation was employed until recently as onordinary »he&gt;rtk*»ct typist, and thou&gt;Ji he has t&amp;iom himself Hhle and Very willing It ie not to be expected that he should be able to cope In the anae wny with corrupt aeBeageB. I have apent n^ny hours with him trying to decypher aestages sent by contjuls at posts served by the Persian lines, end if In future the Foreign Office telegrams arrive In a state &gt;nything like as corrupt I foresee very serious delays* Sven in present conditions the cypher o 1 leer, assisted whenever possible by Mr*Pyres and myself, has as a rale quite as much work as he sen cop© with. It should be realised, too, that the reorganisation of staff ’ditch &gt;lee©3 him in hi a present position h s effected a very considerable saving of public money* (Mease see our deanstch Ho*&gt;'96 of June 30th). This should in fairness be tr^ken into account in connection with the Tre sury’s second point. 3. In our telegram of October 18th wo stated that the avera*© Persian telegraph operator seemed barely con versant with the Latin character. A dually, the ©bailees of error are still further increased by the fact that the bulk or* those operators are by ori /in j r^enians, hove all of thorn a knowled;e of Russian. The Russian alphabet is composed largely of letters identical with the Latin, but used for totally different sounds. r hus the Russian B corresponds to Sngllsh V, C to S,r to R, Y to U,H to N, a (in script) to t, and so on* The oomuslon caused in the case of an Armenian operator whose only Urooean lanuage is a smattering of Russian - (and that is the normal case; - may be? easily imagined, and has in point of fact already proved a source of infinite trouble in telegraphic correspondence with consular officers at posts served by the Persian lines* This is a factor which certainly doesdoes aot apply either in Chin or Afghanistan, ^nd though it might perhaps he argued that it would apply witk ©Yen grater forca in Russia and Bulgaria, the answer is I think that the standard o efficiency is far higher n hose countries. The second point raided by the Treasury has been iallu&amp;©d to above. It is r levant to i dd that the recent redaction of staff has had the effect of placing on the regaining clerks a heavier imrden Him w © anticipated. If the telegraphist’s spare tine were to be employed as a shorthand typist, it would, of course, greatly ease that burden, and in normal times * there are, ot c urse, lack periods - the clerical staff would still not be underworked. /s regards point (3), it was, I bellere, sir Robert Clive's opinion, when he originally made this proposal, that the use of the Persian line for s limited period each day night quit© possibly be secured free o charge as a set-off to our extensive concessions in the matter of the withdrawal of the Indo- '.urooean Telegraph Department. Whether that hope is still justified we cannot say definite ly until we get the promised Persian reoly (see our telegram of Sovpmbcr 18th, but the possibility seems at any rate worth considering. #ith regard to the Treasury’s 1 set point, I a® not fuiite clear ns to its bearing on our own case. The only other British institutions in Persia which ore sufficiently important to carry on telegraphic correspondence on a l^rge scale with abroad are the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Anglo-Feral an Oil Oomnaiiy. These will certainlycertainly isuf er when the lines are tr naferred to the Pereien OoTemment* But the codes they employ are presum ably of a simplicity \^iieh renders the decoding of corrupt message® a comparatively simple business, and the fact that most of their messages are of a mere or less standard pattern must also help them a lot, TTen so, they will be hard hit. 81r Bobort Clive was himself by no means optimistic as to the acceptance by the Persian Government o this proposal, but felt that the prospects were otherwise so black; that it was worth trying. If things are simply allowed to take their course, I foresee that In the next rush period, perhaps when the treaty negotiations are r Burned, the cypher officer (who Is always helped whenever possible by the Chancery;, may be unable to ke«p abreast of the work, and that serious delays and probably import ant mistakes due to faulty guese-vork m^y ba the result. It would, I think, be rash to count too much on the emnloy- ment by the Persian Government of a sufficient number of ex-emoloyoas of the Department to deal with international traffic. Prvtt certain enquiries made of the Tehran Superintendent it looks os though they intended to do bo, but on the other brand Mr.Newton ham been told by several of his skilled native operators that nothing would induce them to stay on even if the Persian Government were to offer them employment nn generous terms; several of the Popartment*• opera or* were tsken over not long ago for the working o certain internal lines under the ruralan Government, and the treatment they received (broken promises regarding pensions, pay always much in arrears, etc.,etc.,; has aprerently been an object lesson to the others.

Dear Baxter, You asked me to let you 'enow the arrangeBente in force as regards the sending and receipt of telegrars by the inieter at Kabul. 1 find that we are in this matter entirely dependent, between Kabul and Peshawar, on the Afgiian wireless, operated by Afghan operators, over which all telegrams sent and received by the Kabul begatlea paea. So far as we are aware, the Legation have not even a private receiving wireless set. I find, in this connection, that when Sir Francis Hunphrys returned to Kabul in the summer of 1928 he took with him a receiving set, 1 ut he had to leave the transmitting set at Peshawar until the permission of the Af$i*n (ievemnent could be obtained for its installation.
