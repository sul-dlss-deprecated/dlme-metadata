Notes of a conversation between The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and the Arab Mission representing the Emir ibn Baud. 26th. November 1919. The Secretary of State received Feisal Ibn Baud end Ahmad-ibn-Thunaiyan at the Foreign Office on November 26th. 1919. After customary greetings had been exchanged, the Secretary of State said that he proposed to review the general situation between King Hussein and Ibn Saud before replying in detail to the requests presented on the 1st. November in a Note read to the India Office and Foreign Office Joint Conference. His Majesty's Government were well aware that Ibn Saud was one of the great Independent Rulers of Arabia; he was their friend and they had entered into Treaty engagements with him. They were earnestly desirous that the friendly relations established in this Treaty should be maintained. During the past year Ibn Saud had come into con flict with another of the friends of His Majesty's Government, - His Highness Sherif Hussein, the King of the Hedjaz. Without going into the merits of the con troversy, he wished to make it clear that this was a st*e of affairs which His Majesty's Government could not view with equanimity. They were desirous of seeing the principles of cohesion and unity replace separation and discord in Arabian politics, and the first essential to the attainment of this object was that the two greatest Independent Rulers of Arabia should live at peace with one another.At ' ^ Ol His Majesty* s Government were delighted to welcome Ibn Baud’s son, and the Mission which had acconpanied hin to England, hut so long as the main issues between Ibn Baud and King Hussein remained undecided they were not prepared to give specific answers to such questions as those presented by the Arab Mission on the 1st. November. The outbreak of hostilities between these two rulera had caused considerable disquiet to His Majesty’s Government, who had given careful thought to the means by which they could be instrumental in bring ing it to an end. In the month of June the position had been that Ibn Baud was in possession of Khurma and Turaba, and had successfully resisted two attempts b^y King Hussein to reassert his authority in those places. His Majesty’ Government had despatched Mr.philby by air with the intention that he should make his way to Ibn Baud, and propose to him that hostilities should cease pending a settlement of the dispute by a British Commission. One of che conditions which was to have been made by Mr.phiibj' was that Ibn Baud should withdraw his forces at least from Turaba, and that a strip of country should be left unoccupied between the contending a.rmies. Ibn Baud had, however, in the meantime, received a pre vious message from His Majesty’s Government which had induced him to suspend hostilities and return to Riadh. Mr.Philby was accordingly unable to deliver the message of His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Baud had remained in possession of Khurma, and Turaba ever since. He wished the Mission to understand clearly that on the evidence before them, His Majesty’s Government were inclined to accept King Hussein’s contention that he.• hr) he was the rightful owner not only of Turaba, to which his claim appeared indisputable, but also of Khurraa: but it was impossible tor them to make a definite decision on points of detail from this distance. They had been quite ready to appoint a Boundary Commission if this had been the desire of both parties, ibn Saitd had always agreed to this solution, but King Hussein had objected. His Majesty’s Government were now of opinion that the best way of settling the dispute between the two rulers was that they should meet personally and talk matters over, either at Jeddah or possibly at some other place. They had accordingly suggested to King Hussein that this should be done, and he would be glad to know how Ibn Saud would be likely to view a similar proposal. Ahmed-ibn-Thunaiyan replied that he had no doubt that Ibn Saud would welcome a meeting with King Hussein ' himself, but he was not authorised to give an under taking to this effect, nor could he say anything as to the place of meeting, ibn Saud would not agree to meet any representative of King Hussein, though he might depute a representative in the event of a personal inter view between the two rulers being impracticable. The Secretary of State remarked that, so far as he knew, King Hussein had never refused to meet Ibn saud. He had, however, definitely refused to accept arbitra tion by a British Commission on the question of Khurma. The intention of His Majesty’s Government was that a meeting should now be brought about between the two rulers for a frank discussion of all points at issue between them. This was what he might call the first step of the negotiations. It was hoped that such a * meeting would result in general agreement; if, however, it turned out that the two parties were unable to agree, His Majesty’s Government suggested that the second step shouldshould be the intervention of an impartial Britisfcjffi^ 1 ? 131 who would endeavour to decide such points as remained in dispute. He asked whether Ibn saud would agree to this second step, Ahmed-ibn~Thunaiyan again pointed out that he had no authority to give a definite answer, but his personal opinion was that Ibn Saud would accept arbit ration by an impartial British official,provided that King Hussein agreed equally to be bound by that offic- ial’s decision. The Secretary of state said that His Majesty's Government would of catrse make it a condition that both parties should accept without question the decision of tne aroitrator, and that unless both parties agreed to this the proposal would fall to the ground. Ahmad- i on-Thun ai yan enquired whether His Majesty's Government would guarantee both parties-against ro infringement by the other party of the agreement arrived at. Tne Secretary of State replied that His Majesty's Government could not undertake this until they- saw the agreement, bit that they would be glad to accept any reasonable agreement arrived at by the two parties, and would use their influence to restrain either party from infringing it in future. 3 He went on to say that the appointment of a Boundary Commission,which he might call the third step in tne negotiations; would present no difficulty if the first two stages had been successfully negotiated, nor would it be necessary at all if, as he himself hoped, it was found that, the first stage would be sufficient. He thought that what he had said provided an answer to most of the points raised in the Mission's note of the 1st.November, i-t Ahmad-ibn~Thunaiyan' s request, however, he dealt y withl i \ with them seriatirn; In answer to No.l. he expressed some surprise u!iat ' Ita Saud should demand the ratification of the Treaty entered into by His Majesty's Government. There was,so far as he knew, no terra set to the Treaty,and in these circumstances there did not appear to be any necessity for its renewal. with regard to No .2 His Majesty's Government did not propose to discuss the disputed boundary with either party. They sincerely hoped that a meeting would tssul't in an a,gra c m 6 n*t being arrived, at-. As to ho. 3 tne question of an embargo on pilgrims from Nejd appeared to him to depend entirely Ou the relations between the two lulers. If,as he hoped before the next pilgrimage season commenced,they had found a solution to their differences, the question would not arise. In answer to No.4 he mpst disclaim any liability on une part of His Majesty's Government to rehabilitate the territories of I bn Saud from damages which extended ov.„r the past fifty years. He did not consider that it was a suitable moment to discuss the enhancement of his subsidy at a time when he was not on friendly terms witn a friend and ally of His Majesty's Government. He did not qaite understand the last suggestion that Mr; Phil by should be despatched to Ibn Saud as Political Agent empowered for the solving of the bound ary question and other kindred problems,in as nuch as the proposals now put forward by His Majesty's Govern- uient would, he hoped, real It in all these problems being solved without British intervention. With regard to the attachment of a, British official to the Mission for its return journey^ this was a matter \tiich would, he understood, be arranged by the &lt;Inal a Office to whom he would not fail to the Mission 1 s wishes. represent In conclusion he impressed upon Peisal-ihn- and upon Ahmad-ihn-Thunaiyan the paramount necessity of ion Saud’s establishing friendly relations Wj.tn the King of the Hejas. Tliis was the most important point, and all questions of detail should be made subordinate to it. frbb !

The Chairman said the Conference had once more met to discuss the vexed question of Khurma. The last meeting on this subject had been held on the 17th June. The position at that time had been acute ; Mr. Philby had been present and had stated with great force the case for Ibn Saud. The danger of a further advance lx Ak ,. r] I n had been . so Passing that the Conference had ( | esi 1 rable ^ enter into communication with both parties. Mr Fhdby had been despatched from London by air, but had found on his arrival at Cairo that the situation had become easier, and that Ibn baud had withdrawn, having obtained what he wanted for the moment, the ownership of Khurma and Turaba. „ , Tl ?® 9.? nfere 5°e ^ad now the advantage of the presence of Colonel Wilson of Jeddah, who would present the case from Kino- Husseins point of view. The position now was that the AkhwaiT with or without the authority of Ibn Saud, were in possession of Khurma and Turaba. . ^ At the last meeting, the Conference had come to the conclusion that while the ownership of Khurma was in dispute the ownership ol luraba was not. The arrangement had been that Ibn Saud [1569] d2 should be induced to withdraw at least from furaba, and leave an unoccupied area or “ no-man’s land ” between the two contending forces. The case of Khurma, from King Hussein’s point of view, had since been stated by Colonel Wilson in one of the documents now before the Conference (LD.C.R-3677). Hussein contended.^ that the Khurma district had for generations been under tht jurisdiction of Mecca, and that for a long time past he had been appointing representatives there. Late in 1916 the^representative was one Khalid, who showed a tendency towards M ahabism. He had been sent for to Mecca and admonished by King Hussein. The fact that he had obeyed the summons appeared to establish Hussein s suzerainty over the town. During his absence the Kadi of Khurma was twice summoned to Mecca and lectured by King Hussem for preaching the Wahabi faith. He persisted, however, in doing this and was summoned to Mecca a third time, soon after the Emir Khalid’s return. On his refusing to_ obey the summons he was discharged, and a successor appointed in his place, but Khalid openly raised the standard of revolt against Hussein, and refused to allow the new Kadi to take up his duties. A suggestion had been made that both Khalid and the Kadi were accepting pay both from Hussein and Ibn Sand, and it appeared possible that this might have been the case. King Hussem had made two efforts to subdue his rebel lieutenant by force, but two successive expeditions led by Shakir and the Emit Abdullah were hmominiously defeated by the Akhwan. It was clear that whatever might be the rights of the case there was no comparison whatever between the military forces. The danger of a Wahabi advance on Mecca had been so acute at the time of the last meeting that the Conference had more or less gone back on their original policy of supporting King Hussein. They had, as it were, been stampeded by the military danger to the Holy Places. They had also been rather taken with the idea of the proposed Boundary Com mission, and had been inclined to consider Hussein unreasonable because he would not accept it. They were now told that as a matter of amour-yvopre King Hussein could not admit arbitration on the ownership of Khurma. He regarded this place as so much a part of the Hejaz that if he were to agree to arbitration upon its ownership he would lose prestige in Arabia to the same extent that Great Britain, for example, would lose prestige if she accepted arbitration on the ownership of a part of these islands. In reply to any suggestion that he should accept arbitration, Hussein was always prepared to fire off his last cartridge and threaten to abdicate. He had pressed the trigger more than once, but the result had only been a misfire ; only that day a report had been received from Jeddah that he had done it again. His Majesty’s Government were being made to look rather ridiculous by the stubbornness of this sensitive old man, and he did not himself see why he could not be brought to reason. The Conference should not lose sight of the fact that the policy of His Majesty’s Government was essentially a Hussein policy. Ibn Sand was undoubtedly important, but not so important to them as the Sherif of Mecca. Colonel Wilson wished to be given some / reassuring message to take to King Hussein, and it was for the Conference to consider what form this message should take. At the same time, they had to consider what reply could be given to the questions asked by Ibn Baud’s delegation who were now in London, and were to return in a few days to their own country. These questions were to be found in one of the papers laid before the Con ference (I.D.C.E.—3675.) Colonel Wilson said that he himself regarded the ownership of Khurma by King Hussein as absolutely incontestable. He con- sidered it almost certain that if Ibn Baud’s Government remained at /t Khurma and Turaba, King Hussein would definitely abdicate. Itwas impossible to foresee what would happen if he decided to do this, there appeared to be two alternatives before His Maiesty’s Government: They could once more attempt to bring pressure to bear upon Ibn Saud by issuing an ultimatum to him; cutting down his subsidy; and threatening to break off relations with him there was also the possibility of blockading him from the Persian Guit side, though he understood that this would not be easy. If His Majesty s Government decided upon this line of action, they would run the risk of the Akhwan overrunning Arabia in the event il w ^ f ! ai 1 m ^ r com P ] y with the terms of the ultimatum. Ibn Rashid and the Idnsi might be induced to join Hussein agair% Ibn baud but he was not confident that even this combination would be strong enough to check the Akhwan. The other alternative was to leave things as they were : the almost inevitable result of this would be that King Hussein would abdicate unless we gave him some crumbs of comfort. His abdication would be followed by something very like anarchy in the Hejaz. The tribes would get completely out of hand ; the rival faction which supported Ali Haidar u m -? e ^ lat - e ^ raiSe t ^ e ^ r ’ pilgrimages would become very dithcult, if not impossible, for a year or two, if not longer; and the Akhwan would no doubt take advantage of the disorder in the Heiaz to overrun the country and occupy the Holy Places. He would be glad to be authorised to tell King Hussein on his return to Jeddah that His Majesty’s Government adhered to their recognition of his ownership of Khurma and Turaba. 2 he Chairman pointed out that Colonel Wilson’s two alternatives both ended m the advance of the Akhwan, the only difference being that in one case they would advance more quickly than in the other. he suggestion that Ibn Rashid and the Idrisi should be induced to take sides with King Hussein against Ibn Saud amounted to a complete negation of the policy of His Majesty’s Government, which was to introduce peace and unity into the Arabian Peninsula. Mr. Philby thought that the position was perfectly clear If Colonel Wilson’s suggestion that His Majesty’s Government should prejudge the ownership of Khurma and Turaba were accepted the inevitable result would be that Ibn Saud would occupy Mecca and the whole of the Hejaz. He declined to believe that either Ibn Rashid or the Idrisi would join Hussein against Ibn Saud. Hussein had recently paid Ibn Rashid 25,000Z., but this did not mean that the latter was necessarily friendly to him. Even if he did join Hussein, the Akhwan would defeat them both. He had mentioned this view before to His Majesty’s Government, but His Majesty’s Government had disagreed with him; he had, however, been justified by events. Replying to a question by the Chairman, he said that Ibn Saud would not move forward if His Majesty’s Government decided to do nothing, but he still desired an answer to ms demand for a Boundary Commission, and the presence of his delegation in London seemed to provide a good opportunity for this answer to be given. Colonel Wilson, replying to a question by the Chairman, said that King Hussein did not object to arbitration in principle, quite the reverse ; it was only on the ownership of Khurma that he could not accept arbitration. The Chairman said that he could not understand Hussein’s objections; they seemed to him to be dictated entirely by false pride. If his claim was so incontestable, and his proofs so unanswerable, why did he not produce them ? He did not see why Hussein should refuse to state his case in an office to an impartial arbiter, though he quite understood his objection to the publicity [1569] B 24 of a Boundary Commission. What was required was delimitation, not demarcation of the boundary. Vv ould it not he possible to bring about a meeting, either between Hussein and Ibn baud themselves, or between plenipotentiaries of the two parties, either at Jeddah, Aden or Cairo ? The first thing to do was to get them to agree without our interference if possible. If this attempt was unsuccessf - we could then ask them both to state their case before soi^ impartial officer of high rank, who need not necessarily be an expert. Colonel Cornwallis suggested that, though it would be difficult to get King Hussein to state the case about Khurma, for reasons which had been pointed out by Colonel Wilson, it might make it easier for him if we simply suggested that he should meet Ibn baud for the purpose of coming to a general agreement on the various points which must necessarily arise between two coterminous States. Mr. Philby thought that if King Hussein were induced to agree that, in the event of a discussion between himself and Ibn baud not having a satisfactory result, the whole case should then be laid before an impartial arbiter, Ibn Saud would have no objection to meeting him at Jeddah. Colonel Wilson said that there would be a better chance of the two parties coming to an agreement if Hussein were represented by Abdullah, who was more inclined to be reasonable. He did not think that Hussein would agree to leave the Hejaz and meet Ibn Saud at Aden or Cairo, but it was possible that he might come down from Mecca to Jeddah to meet him. He thought it would be better for Abdullah to meet Ibn Saud. He said that if the meeting took place at Jeddah it would be necessary for Ibn Saud or his pleni potentiary to be sent there by sea as neither could well travel through the Hejaz. Mr. Philby said that if Ibn Saud were to represent his own case he would certainly expect Hussein to meet him personally, and would not agree to meet Abdullah. Sir Arthur Hirtzel said that the India Office had all along been in favour of bringing the two parties together. He gathered from certain of the papers that the India Office were regarded as out-and-out supporters of Ibn Saud, and he wished to point out that this was not so. What they were concerned about was that Ibn Saud (whose case as stated in Mr. Philby s report had rather impressed them) should not be thrown over merely because that was the most convenient course. The Chairman said that it was clearly desirable to bring about a meeting if possible. He suggested that Colonel Wilson on ^ is return to Jeddah should have a frank, face-to-face talk with King Hussein somewhat on the following lines : He should start by saying that he had just returned from London, where the whole question had been discussed by His Majesty’s Government. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had himself taken a great personal interest in the question, and was very anxious that he should compose his differences with Ihn Saud. After examining the arguments put forward on the King’s behalf by Colonel Wilson, His Majesty’s Government were of opinion that King Hussein had an excellent case. So excellent did this case appear that they could not understand why His Majesty declined to state it himself before some impartial arbiter to be appointed by His Majesty s Government. If it was the case, as Hussein contended, that his ownership of Khurma and Turaba was incontestable, there did not appear to be any valid objection to his producing the proofs which would convince any arbiter at once of the justice of his claim. He should realise that there was at present no question of the l ■public demarcation of the boundary by a British Commission It was only suggested that he should agree either to meet Ibn Baud tCb f 7 t? + i d ?i, Ute K a - re P r ® sent * ti ™ *0 meet a plenipotentiary from isue betwlen tt t °f ^ all pofnls a“ o'nininrt r u th two ., ru ? ers - was not anticipated that public p wou d necessarily jump to the conclusion from the fact of ipon™^ mth^nor 6 0W / lershi P ot ' ^ hllrma was being arbitrated upon, tt might not even be necessary for an arbiter to step in at all oresTnt'in c aS rt SS f ted “ ™P artial Britis b official Should be P .. as ® the two parties failed to arrive at an agreement He must realise that if His Majesty’s Government were S, present ifn Saud with another ultimatum, the result would be that P the whole 1 1 ant power of t.,e Akhwan would be let loose upon himself.

During the interval between the beginning of the war in Europe and tbe “te- vention of Turkey, when the attitude of the Turkish Government was becoming more and more hostile' to the Allies, rumours reached His Majesty s Government 1 1 Sand wa= nrenaring to throw in his lot with the Turks. The Turks did, in fact, S ,. _ , t,!' ( mc ile Bin Saud and Bin Rashid, and secure their military co-operation f tbfTurk“de But Bin Saud evaded these overtures (84042/46261/14 and 17000/1385/15 ■ No. 48). In October 1914 the Sheikh of Koweit wrote to him on 1 own initiative stating that he proposed to stand by His Majesty’s Government himself and tZt hTadvted him to do the same (59746/46261/14). And Bin Saud wrote back that “ in the event of war with Turkey he would stand by the bheikh and t le n ‘'X'SifSKS .1.1 B» Saud mcliuing O-rt .h. Tu r fe audft. imnortance in the event of war with Turkey, of securing his friendship h ad .^ liea a t decided the India Office to send Captain Shakespear, formerly British Resident Koweit on a special mission to Bin Sand (59038/46261/14). On the 4 th Octoter, ^4, +V.P TJpaident in the Persian Gulf was instructed to inform Bm Saud of this m Ibreugh the Sheffih of Koweit; and on the 8th October, 1914, instructions were sent tothe Viceroy tor a further communication (also to be made through Koweit) explaining His Majesty s Government’s attitude towards Turkey, and asking Bin Saud to help them to keep the peace in Arabia in the event of Turkish aggression leading to war. Three Arabic letters were accordingly drafted at Koweit, one by the British B,esident 'P ^ ie other two bv the Sheikh (82216/14), in w*hich Bin Saud was addressed in the toonse of the India Office instructions and was informed of Captain Shakespear’s mission. These letters were despatched on the 15th October, 1914. In answer to them, Bin Saud wrote letters on the 24th October, 1914, to the Political Resident in the Gulf and to Captain Shakespear himself. The letter to Captain Shakespear was conveyed through Bin bauds lieutenant on the Hasa coast, and the latter was instructed to arrange a meeting for him with Captain Shakespear when that officer arrived (5353/1385/15). Meanwhile, on the 14th September, 1914, the Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf had submitted to the Government of India drafts of letters and notices to the different Gulf Chiefs, which he had prepared for the event of war between Great Britain and Turkey, and which he proposed to issue upon the receipt of intelligence that war had broken out (64214/61439/14). The draft letter to Bin Saud (which was to follow a brief circular announcing that a state of war existed between Great Britain and Turkey) ran as follows :— “ In continuation of my previous letter, informing your Excellency of the outbieak of war between Great Britain and Turkey, I am authorised by my Government to request your Excellency to co-operate with our honoured friends, their Excellencies the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah, in the capture of Basrah from the Turks or, should such, a task be beyond your united powers, which seems unlikely, that you should make such arrangements, especially above Gurnaii, as may prevent assistance reaching Basrah, untd such time as the British arrive and take over the city. Consistently with your main object, viz., the capture oi isolation of Basrah, we request your Excellency to take all measures in your power to prevent the plundering of British merchants and property in the town of Basrah itself and in the neighbourhood. The personal safety of the Europeans should also be a special object of your solicitude. In return for this valuable co-operation, I am authorised by my Government to assure your Excellency that, in the event of our success—and succeed we shall, msha Allah—Basrah will never again be allowed to be subject to Turkish authority. I . am further to assure your Excellency that the British Government will guarantee your Excellency— E Against all reprisals by the Turks in consequence of these measures ; &lt;£ 2. Against attack by sea ; and “3. lhat they will be prepared to recognise your Excellency as independent Ruler of Nejd and al-Hasa, and to enter into treaty relations with your Excellency. “I am also directed to request your Excellency to turn the Turkish garrisons of al-Hasa and al-Qatif out of your territory.” draft was approved in due course by the Government of India and the India Umce, and the letter seems to have been released for delivery on the 3rd November, 1914 (82713/61439/14 : pp. 7-8, 15-6, and 17). The three assurances contained in it became the basis of the subsequent negotiations. Bin Sand’s reply, dated the 28th November, 1914 (17000/1385/15 : No. 46) was phrased as follows : — “ We have received your august communication dated the 3rd November, 1914, m which you state that your honour has already mentioned in your previous letter that the exalted Government of Great Britain has declared war against the Ottoman Government, and that you have been ordered by the illustrious Govern ment to invite us to co-operate with the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Ruler of Koweit—-our cordial friends and sincere allies—and attack Basrah The co-operation with the above-mentioned two friends is incumbent upon us (and so is it for us to) use our good offices with our friends, the illustrious Government, in all useful actions which may be required by her. And I am using my endeavours and efforts in furthering the common interests of all friends. You should rest fully assured and be confident in this question.4 “ 1 am one of the greatest helpers to the Government of Great Britain, and she will God willing, obtain satisfactory results, as we have mentioned to our mutual friend, Captain Shakespear. As to the Ottoman soldiers, we did not allow “ single one of them to remain (in these parts) after our occupation, and have turned them all out. . ,, , ,, “ But as to the following three matters mentioned by you, namely, the prom . of the exalted Government to protect and safeguard us against the Ottoman Government by affording us her assistance and her future protection (to us) against any attack and hostility which may be made by sea her recognition of the independence of my chiefship on all the parts of Nejd, al-Hasa, and Qatif, and the conclusion of treaties between us, (these) wdl depend on our arrival at Koweit. I am leaving my headquarters on this date and am bound tor Koweit, and we will make the necessary verbal negotiations, in order that we may earn the approval of our friend, the Government of Great Britain. No farther steps were taken on the British side till Captain Shakespear, travelling via Bahrein and Koweit, reached Bin Sand’s camp on the 31st December, 1914 ^ During the next few days he discussed exhaustively with Bin Saud the latter s relations with Great Britain and Turkey since their previous meeting a year before Bin Saud referred to the various messages he had received from representatives of Great Britain during the past three months, and dwelt especially upon the letter o± the 3rd November, 1914, from the Officiating Resident m the Gulf. He cited the three assurances contained in it, but remarked that “ the document was a vague letter, did not specify whether the assurances were limited merely to the present war. or also included the future, gave no hint whether other conditions would be required of himself later, and could not be regarded as a binding instrument between the two parties for the future. Captain Shakespear concluded from these conversations that Bin Saud “ had no intention of abandoning his neutral position, with freedom to make his own arrangements with the Turks (and he was confident that he could secure from them a very good £ second best’) until he held a signed and sealed treaty with the British Government ; nor would he move a step further towards making matters either easier for us or more difficult for the Turks so far as the present war was concerned, until he obtained in that treaty some very solid guarantee'of his position, with Great Britain practically as his suzerain.” Captain Shakespear therefore asked Bin Saud to draw up “ a preliminary draft, containing what he was prepared to accept and what he desired,’ which he (Captain Shakespear) might then forward to His Majesty’s Government for their consideration. This suggestion was promptly carried out by Bin Saud, and in a report, dated the 4th January, 1915, to Sir P. Cox (in which the foregoing conversations were also put on record) Captain Shakespear submitted a rough translation of Bin Saud’s desiderata :— “ The clauses which will be reasons for a binding agreement between myself ( £ Bin Saud ’) and the Great British Government:— “ i. That the British Government will acknowledge and admit that Nejd, al-Hasa, Qatif, their surroundings and the ports appertaining to them on the shores of the Persian Gulf are to me and (are) the territory of my fathers and forefathers ; that I am the independent ruler of them, and after me my sons and their descendants by inheritance; and that the above-mentioned territory is an independent territory in which there is no (right of) interference to any foreign Power. “ 2. That they (the British Government) will declare its (the territory’s) boundaries north, south, east, and west, by land and by sea, and that (regarding) the nomads who wander between neighbouring towns, which are either under British protection or (directly) under British Government, if there should arise differences between me and the chiefs of the said towns and complaints be made in (these) matters, they should be decided according to the ownership of fathers and ancestors.3. That all existing jurisdiction in all my territories shall continue in accordance with the laws of the sacred Mohammedan Shariat, according to the sect of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal-as-Salafi, and all who dwell therein shall be subject to them in all matters or (shall be subject) to the customary law of the towns in which they may be, whether my own subjects or the subjects of States adjacent to my territories—by reason of religious obligation we are helpless without it nor can we exceed it. 4. There shall be no permission to any foreigner to acquire a hand’s-breadth of my territories (within the defined) boundaries, not even by a substitute, except alter reference to myself and with my permission. “ 5. After acknowledgment of the above clauses, that she (Great Britain) will promise to prevent and to defend from all oppression and aggression which may come upon or happen to my territories by land or by sea, from whatever Power it may be. “ 6. That she (Great Britain) will promise that she will not permit nor encourage noi accord sanctuary to accused persons or fugitives from our territories, whether townsmen or nomads. 7. That she (Great Britain) will respect and protect the rights of my subjects, and deal with them as she deals with her own subjects while they may ^ be (resident) in her territories and dependencies. “ 8. If she (Great Britain) accepts and acknowledges the foregoing clauses, then I accept and acknowledge severance of dealings with any other Power in all (matters of) concessions, interference, and intercourse, ^ except with reference to the Great British Government. 9. I bind myself to protect trade within my territories from all aggression, and that I will deal (with her subjects) according to the treatment my own subjects receive in all matters of government and business in her (Great Britain’s) countries and dependencies. 10. I bind ^myself to the protection (in) the coasts and ports which are under my Government from all aggression to the subjects of the British Government and those under their protection. 11. I will forbid the traffic in arms and ammunition, whether by a Govern ment or by (way of) merchandise, from all the ports which are under my Government, on condition that if I should be m need of anything m arms and ammunition I will refer to the British Government in • order to obtain my wants.” ^ oc y ment ’ Captain Shakespear added some observations of his own, which have still, after four years, an important bearing on the eventual settlement ot our permanent relations with Bin Saud after the war :—* I venture to submit that Bin Saud, in effect, asks for little more than what has been already conveyed in the Acting Besident’s assurances, if these were meant to apply to the future and were not limited to the present crisis, and if they are interpreted liberally and generously. In exchange, Bin Saud offers to make himselt a British vassal for good. The addition to our responsibilities does not appear heavy :— “(a.) The Turkish menaces from the west and north of Nejd, though very real to Bin Saud, need give us no anxiety—we have no reason to suppose they will be more successful in the future than they have been within the last two or three decades, while, guaranteed from attack by sea, Bin Saud will be in a far better position to meet them than was possible hitherto. Should they become threatening, strong diplomatic representations would probably suffice to prevent any attempt on a scale with which Bin Saud could not cope himself. (b.) We should probably be called upon to act as arbiters somewhat more frequently than hitherto between the Arab Sheikhs along the coast and Bin Saud, a duty largely to the advantage of our own interests. -n. q later, on the 24th Janfiary, 1915, Captain Shakespear was killed in a battle between in feaud and Bm Rashid, at whieh he had insisted on being present. No blame attaches to Bin Saud for inis lamentable event. [939] C6 On the other hand, the advantages seem to be considerable : (/•) (a.) Complete control of the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf. (b.) Similar complete control of the arms traffic. • ru ^ i ! (c.) The practical exclusion of foreign Powers and influence m Cent^-^ ; (d 1 The security induced by British suzerainty and ‘ Bin Saud s strong 1 control of the Bedouin tribes will give a great impetus to trade through the Persian Gulf ports, probably diverting a share o± what now passes through the Red Sea poits. . . . A i • ‘ (e.) The great influence Bin Saud has over Mohammedan opinion m Arabia, an influence likely to increase as the Turkish Empire breaks up and the Khalifate of the Sultan is questioned, will be a British asset. Bin Saud’s influence with all Arab tribes, and particularly with the Northern Anazah, with whom our occupation ot Lower Mesopotamia will bring us in close contact. Upon receipt of Captain Shakespear’s report, Sir P. Cox telegraphed on the 16th January, 1915, to the Government of India (17000/1385/15 : No. 49) a summary of Bin Saud’s desiderata, and made the following further suggestions. “ Bin Saud should undertake :— « First —To receive representative of British Government either at his capitaUr^ea-port^or ^Uettra-territoriality for our non-Mohammedan '' ■« Thirdly .— To abstain from waging war by sea without our consent, and to co-operate for the suppression of piracy . , , . “ Fourthly.—To protect pilgrim traffic passing through his territory. “Fifthly—To levy customs dues at rates which we consider reasonable, having regard to rate prevailing at Bahrein and Koweit.^ “Sixthly.- —To allow British merchant vessels to visit his ports. “ Seventhly .—To agree to locate post office and possibly telegraph office at his port when the time comes.” “I do not include any item regarding slave trade, as that is not now a serious difficulty, and has given us no trouble at Koweit. , , . ,, “ Only point regarding which it seems necessary to offer comment here is the question of protection against external aggression by land. When we invited Bin Saud to move on Basrah, we undertook to protect him against reprisals by Turks, so that, as far as latter are concerned, what Bin Saud now asks us to give does not amount to much more. Apart from Turks, Central Arabia is practical y inaccessible by land to any Power but ours, and I venture to think that we should incur little risk by giving the desired undertaking, subject to (the) reservation that aggression be unprovoked. . _ ^ ,. r* a “ We have publicly declared that our object is to effect liberation of Arabs from oppressive yoke (of) Turkey. In this case there is no question of annexation of territory to which our allies could take exception, while Bm Sauds weight in scale would be no mean asset to joint cause of us all. Can I possibly be authorised to draft a treaty on above lines for negotiation by Captain Shakespeai . s a not now have the opportunity of meeting Bin Saud myself. “ I am obliged to give Bin Saud some reply by his messenger, who has orders to return at once. I am sending Captain Shakespear purport of above additional points and asking him to use his discretion in discussing them with Bm Saud. Io Bin Saud I am replying that I hope that an instrument safeguarding his position can be arrived at somewhat on lines indicated, and that I have telegraphed to Government on subject, but that treaty must necessarily take a little time to draw up.” On the 29th January, 1915, after further correspondence with Sir P. Cox (21633/15, Nos. 3 and 8), the Viceroy telegraphed to the India Office as follows (11837/1385/15) “ In order to expedite settlement, Bin Saud has himself submitted memo randum setting forth tentatively his proposals for formulation of treaty. Theseinclude many matters of detail, fraught with difficulty and requiring ripe con sideration for instance, definition of boundaries, law and jurisdiction, harbouring of refugees, reciprocal treatment of subjects, arms traffic, and arms facilities. “ We consider early conclusion of treaty with Bin Saud most important, but that, for the present, it should be on broad lines somewhat similar to the original Afghanistan agreement with Abdur Bahman, and suggest following :— “1. British Government recognises Bin Saud as independent ruler of Nejd, Hasa, and Katif, and guarantees hereditary succession to his dynasty, subject to the acceptance of successors by tribesmen and approval of His Majesty’s Government; 2 . In the event of unprovoked aggression on his territories by any foreign Power, British Government are prepared to aid Bin Saud to such extent and in such manner as the situation may require ; “ 3. In return, Bin Saud agrees to have no dealings with any other foreign Power, nor grant concessions to subjects of any other foreign Power, except on the advice of the British Government, which advice he will unreservedly follow ; “4. British Government and Bin Saud agree to conclude, as soon as this can be arranged, a detailed treaty in regard to other matters jointly concerning them. “ Cox agrees that a preliminary treaty on these lines would meet the case, and thinks Bin Saud would accept it. Dynastic guarantee of some kind would pxobably be essentia].* That proposed appears sufficiently guarded.” On the 30th January, 1915, the India Office communicated this telegram to the Foreign Office with the following observations (11837/1385/15) “ Ihe desirability of concluding a treaty with Amir Abdul Aziz follows not merely from the exigencies of the moment, which make it necessary to pay an immediate price for his friendship, but also from the general situation that will be created in the Persian Gulf in the event, as the result of the present war, of the disappearance of Turkish rule from Basra, to which His Majesty’s Government are pledged. It may be anticipated that the Amir of Nejd will be left the master not only of Central Arabia, but also of a long strip of the coast, and in the interest of peace and order it will be essential for the Power that controls the Gulf to have a working arrangement with him. The extent, therefore, to which his claims must be met must be measured not only by the immediate services which he is expected to render, but also by the potential power for mischief which, in the event of success, he will possess, and if permanently estranged will doubtless exercise. “ As regards the terms of the treaty suggested by the Government of India, the dynastic pledge is undoubtedly the crux, but safeguarded in the manner proposed it appears to be free from reasonable objection. It is, however, more than probable that the condition that the successor must be accepted by the tribesmen will be a stumbling-block to Bin Saud, as it was to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, in whose case His Majesty’s Government, under the pressure of the war, have recently approved its abolition. Moreover, regard being had to the very large area over which Bin Saud is to rule and the notoriously factious temper of the Arabs, it may be very difficult to fulfil in practice. We must therefore be prepared for opposition from Bin Saud, and the Marquess of Crewe would not let the negotiations break down over this point. “The guarantee against unprovoked aggression should, in his Lordship’s opinion, be so worded a$ to make His Majesty’s Government sole judges of the nature and extent of the assistance to be given. Subject to these remarks Lord Crewe commends the proposals of the Government of India to Sir E. Grey’s favourable consideration. It is a question whether, in view of the importance of our eventual relations with Bin Saud, the present treaty should not contain a clause binding him (subject to an agreement as to boundaries in the detailed treaty to be concluded later) to abstain from inter ference with Koweit, Bahrein, al-Katar, and the Trucial Chiefs. His Lordship would propose to suggest' this to the Government of India, but to leave it to their discretion. * The Turks had given Bin Saud a dynastic guarantee in their Treaty of the 15th May, 1914. i I 113 On the 1st February, 19 L 5, the India Office, with the concurrence of the Foreign Office, instructed the Viceroy, in the sense of the above letter, as follows (11837/1 , 14168/15):— “ Your proposals are approved subject to following remarks . “ 1 In dynastic guarantee condition of acceptance^ of tribesmen should l secured if possible, brft you will remember difficulty which this caused in case of Mohammerah, and negotiations should not be allowed to break down over this point. . “9 You are presumably prepared for Sheikh of Koweit to ask for similar o-uarantee when both Bin Saud and Sheikh of Mohammerah have it. « 3 . Pledge against unprovoked aggression should be so worded as to make His 0 Majesty’s Government sole judges of nature and extent of assistance. . , , . “ 4 Please consider whether this treaty should not contain clause binding Bin Saud, subject to eventual definition of boundaries, not to interfere with Koweit, Bahrein, al Katar, and Trucial Chiefs. But I leave this to your discretion.” On the 6 th February, 1915, the Government of India communicated these instructions to Sir P. Cox (30472/15 : No. 6 ), and authorised him to enter into negotiations with Bin Saud on the lines laid down, ££ on the clear understanding Biat anv treaty agreed upon is subject to the confirmation of the Government of India. ' Accordingly, Sir P. Cox drafted a treaty in seven articles, the terms of which (see 111069/15) may be summarised at this point:— Article 1. His Majesty’s Government recognise Bin Saud as independent ruler of Nejd al Hasa, Qatif, and their ports on the Gulf Coast, and his descendants l lln b “but the selection of the individual shall be subject to the approval of His Majesty s nment ^ Article 2 —His Majesty’s Government shah aid Bin Saud at their discretion in case of unprovoked aggression against him by a foreign Power. . Article 3 .— Bin Saud renounces diplomatic relations with any foreign Power other than His Majesty’s Government. Article 4 —Bin Saud will not cede, sell, or mortgage territory, or grant concessions to any foreign Power or its subjects, without the consent of His Majesty’s Government Article 5 .—Bin Saud will keep open the pilgrimage routes through his territory to the Holv Places, and will protect pilgrims. _ . ^ t J Article 6 .—Bin Saud will refrain from interference with Koweit, Bahrain, G a f ,a G and the Oman Coast, and any other tribes and chiefs under His Majesty’s Government’s protection. Article 7.—A further detailed treaty shall be concluded later. About the same time (43530/15: No. 14) Bin Sand wrote to Sir P. Cox, asking, in view of Captain Shakespear’s death, either that another officer should be deputed, or that negotiations should be continued by correspondence direct from Basra, and not via Koweit. ^ p-r j- On the 24th February, 1915, in reporting this request to the Government of India, Sir P. Cox made the following proposal :— “ I would propose now to send him draft treaty which was awaiting despatch through Shakespear, together with Viceroy’s letter. In doing so I would advise him to sign it without delay, and say that, as soon as it is completed, an officer can then be deputed to discuss details of second treaty.” The Government of India instructed Sir P. Cox to act as he proposed, and on the 28th February, 1915, this was reported by the Viceroy to the India Office (24119/15). Sir P. Cox’s draft and the Viceroy’s letter were accordingly forwarded to Bin Saud and two letters, both dated the 24th April, 1915, and addressed respectively to the Viceroy and Sir P. Cox, were eventually received in reply from Bm Saud (1U069/15).^^ ^ ^ ^ ^ enc losed a signed copy oi the Arabic version of the treaty. But, to quote his words— « Certain modifications (which are not important) were found necessary for cogent reasons, necessitated by local conditions, the need to reassure the inhabi-tants and the governing family of Bin Sand, and also in view of the knowledge we possess as to the circumstances of the Arabs.” Sir Percy Cox replied to Bin Saud as follows in a letter dated the 26th June. 5 :—■ As regards the treaty, I have understood what you wrote, explaining that you had made certain modifications in the text. I have not the least doubt that we shall succeed in adjusting the wording of the articles into a form which will suit both parties and safeguard the interests of yourself and us ; but, as the wording was difierent to what the Government had approved previously, it has been necessary for me to refer it to them.” On the same date he forwarded to the Government of India translations of his own and Bin Saud s drafts in parallel columns, adding a schedule of Bm Saud’s alterations, and commenting upon them. It may be convenient to set out the two versions in this memorandum :— British draft. In the name of God the Merciful and Compassionate. The High British Government on its own part, and Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Bahman-bin-Faisal al- Saud, Euler of Najd, A1 Hasa and Qatif, on behalf of hmiself, his heirs and successors and tribesmen, being desirous of confirming and strengthening the friendly relations which have for generations existed between the two parties, and with a view to consolidating their respective interests—the British Government have named and appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., British Eesident in the Persian Gulf, as their Plenipotentiary to conclude a Treaty for this purpose with Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Eahman-bin-Faisal al-Saud, I he said Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, and Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Rahman-bin-Faisal al- Saud, hereafter known as “ Bin Saud,” have agreed upon and concluded the following articles :— Bin Saud’s draft.

(Seal of Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Rahman-bin-F aisal-bin-Saud.) Sir P. Cox’s letter and enclosures were received by the Government of India on the 5th July, 1915, and on the 7th July, 1915, the Yiceroy telegraphed as follows to the India Office :— “We have carefully examined modifications proposed by Bin Saud in the preliminary treaty sent to him by Cox for acceptance. These modifications are for the most part unimportant. Important modifications are :•— “In article 1, he omits words ‘subject to approval of British Government after consultation with them ’ in regard to selection of successor. Cox thinks that Bin Saud will accept our wording or some other suitable phrase when our motive is explained. If, however, he refuses, we think we might give way on this point. “ Article 2 , as modified by Bin Saud, reads : ‘ In the event of aggression by any foreign Power on territories of countries belonging to the said Bin Saud and his descendants, British Government will aid Bin Saud in all circumstances and m any place,’ thus omitting the word ‘ unprovoked,’ and entirely altering the words ‘ to such extent and in such manner as situation may seem to them to require. We think word ‘ unprovoked ’ or some -similar term should be inserted, and would suggest words ‘ to such extent and in such manner as may be expedient,’ in place of Bin Sand’s suggestion.“ In article 4, he aads that he will follow the advice of His Majesty’s Govern ment ‘where his interests require it.’ Cox suggests ‘where his interests are not injured thereby,’ and this seems unobjectionable. “ Cox proposes to arrange a meeting shortly with Bin Sand to adjust differences. ^ w f. think he should be authorised to do so, and to negotiate a treaty on lines above indicated, subject to ratification by Government of India.” On the 11 th August, 1915, the India Office communicated to the Foreign Office copies of this telegram and of the documents received from Sir P. Cox, and submitted a draft telegram of instructions to the Viceroy. ^ In their covering letter explaining the grounds of the instructions proposed in this draft, the India Office laid particular stress upon Bin Saud’s omission of the words “subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government,” at the end of article 1 It is ordinarily the policy of His Majesty’s Government to recognise only the de facto luler, and to avoid giving dynastic guarantees; and the rare exceptions which they have made have been in cases—such as that of Mohammerah—where their relations with the ruler have been of long standing, and where the responsi bilities undertaken are limited. Neither of these conditions is present in the case of Bin Saud, and Mr. Chamberlain therefore hopes that Sir P. Cox may be able to obtain the restoration of the words. Those which Bin Saud proposes to substitute are apparently intended to provide for the constitutional election of a successor in a case wdiere the ruler has failed to designate during his lifetime. There seems to be no objection to such a provision, so long as the method of election is practicable, but it does not appear how in such a case His Majesty’s Government are to ensure that only a person agreeable to themselves shall be elected. Since, however, a person elected by a tribal majority would probably have no difficulty in maintaining himself as de facto ruler, if the election had been conducted by a method recognised by the tribes themselves to be valid, undesirable complications are perhaps unlikely to arise.” Ihe draft was concurred in by the Foreign Office, and the following telegram was accordingly despatched by the India Office to the Viceroy on the 16th August, 1915 (111069/15 and 116544/15):— “ Article 1 of treaty. Cox, after suitable explanation, should press for resto ration of original words, to which His Majesty’s Government attach great importance. There seems no objection to election'' - ' in default of designation, pro vided method of election is practicable and recognised as valid according to Arab custom by all tribes concerned. Otherwise we may become involved in inter-tribal disputes. ‘ Article 2 . ‘ Unprovoked ’ should be restored. His Majesty’s Government do not like leaving ambiguity as to their aid, and if Bin Saud will not agree to original words they would prefer ‘ to such extent and in such manner as British Government after consultation with Bin Saud may consider most eftective for protecting his interests.’ Article 4. Cox should secure omission of Bin Saud’s addition if possible; if not, substitution of his own proposal. As regards other alterations he should exercise his discretion.” On the 18th August, 1915, the Government of India communicated the telegraphic correspondence that had passed between the Viceroy and the India Office to Sir P. Cox, and authorised him (141285/15) to arrange a meeting with Bin Saud, as he might think advisable, and negotiate further on these lines, on the understanding that a treaty, if concluded, would be subject to ratification by the Government of India. Accordingly, Sir P. Cox resumed negotiations, and concluded a definite treaty with Bin Saud, on the 26th December, 1915 (201630/15). In a letter dated the 3rd January, 1916 (38086/4650/16), he forwarded to the Government of India a translation of the treaty as signed, and also set out the text of this and of the original British draft (both in translation) in parallel columns, with the alterations marked, and with comments on each alteration, explaining how it arose and * * lor the words in the British draft of article 1 which the Viceroy quoted in his‘telegram of the 7th July, 1915, Bin Saud had substituted “ by the living ruler or by calling for the votes of the subjects inhabiting those countries.”12 what its effect would be. A copy of the text signed on this occasion, and subsequently ratified is printed at the end of the present memorandum, and the passages that differ from the original draft (printed on pp. 9-10 above) are there done into italics. Copies of this text, and of Sir P. Cox’s comments, were transmitted by letter the India Office on the 21st January, 1916, and on the 8th February 1916, the Yicerof telegraphed to the India Office (26095/16) that the Government of India proposed to ratify the treaty in this form if the India Office saw no objection. This proposal was approved by the India Office, with the concurrence of the Foreio-n Office, in a telegram to the Viceroy, dated the 6 th March, 1916 (40708/15 and 67554/15). On the 10 th March, 1916, the Government of India wrote accordingly to Sir P. Cox (71652/16), returning him the two original copies of the treaty signed by himself and Bin Saud, and attaching parchment copies of* the English translation, with instructions that the Arabic version should be written in on the margin of these, and that they should then likewise be signed by Sir P. Cox and Bin baud. These instructions appear to have been carried out, and the parchment copies returned in due course to India. The treaty was eventually ratified by the Government of India on the 18th July, 1916 (174647/16). n , , A Shortly after this, Sherif Husein, with whom His Majesty s Government had entered into relations in the latter part of 1915, wrote to Bin Saud asking for “ alliance ' and “ assistance ; ” and Bin Saud reported this to Sir P. Cox, recalling former aggressions by the Sherif on his (Bin Sand’s) territories and tribes, and expressing mistrust of the Sherd’s intentions. (See Memorandum on British Commitments to King Husein, In view of this, Sir P. Cox submitted on the 8 th September, 1916, that Bm Saud “ should be informed definitely that no present or future understandings between us and the Sherif would prejudice our adherence to the terms of Articles 1 and 2 of our treaty with him of the 26th December, 1915.” And he also suggested that the terms of this treaty might be communicated to the Sherif (180581/16). In regard to the first of these proposals, the India Office, with the concurrence of the Foreign Office (183325/16), telegraphed to the Viceroy on the 19th September, 1916 (191509/16), informing him that “as the policy of encouraging an Arab^ State or Confederation of States was not dead, anything repudiating it should be avoided, and instructing him that “reference to the treaty should be confined to Article 1 , as we could not admit that Article 2 was binding on us as against other Arabs.” These instructions appear to have been carried out by Sir P. Cox m the form of a verbal assurance to Bin Saud on the occasion of a duibai held at Koweit on the 21 st November, 1916, at which Bin Saud was decorated by him with the K.C.I.E. in the presence of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah (235981/16 and 236884/16). The terms of the treaty of the 26th December, 1915, were also communicated to King Husein in due course (see Memorandum on British Commitments to King Husein, Section (vii)), in accordance with Sir P. Cox’s suggestion. Relation of Commitments to Bin Saud to British Desiderata. In considering the bearing of this treaty with Bin Saud upon British desiderata, it has to be remembered that it was intentionally confined to immediate essentials ; that important questions like the regulation of the arms traffic and the status of British nationals in Bin Sand’s territory (brought up by Bin Saud himself), or, again,_ the binding over of Bin Saud to keep the peace at sea in the Gulf (brought up by Sir P. Cox) were postponed for later consideration by the consensus of the Government of India and the India Office ; that article 7 provides for the conclusion of a detailed treaty hereafter ; and that Bin Saud rather than His Majesty’s Government has pressed that this should be carried out at an early date. In examining the present treaty, therefore, little account need be taken of omissions. Yet it may be pointed out that, even as the treaty stands, it contains all the elements of a true trucial treaty. These elements are (a) the right and obligation of His Majesty’s Government to arbitrate in case of disputes between the other party to the treaty and his neighbours, who are bound by similar treaties to His Majesty’s Government; (b) t ie renunciation by the other party of any relations with foreign Powers except through His Majesty’s Government; and (c) a promise on the part of the other party not to alienate territory to a foreign Power except with His Majesty’s Government’s consent. . Of these essential elements, (b) and (c) are explicitly embodied m articles 3 and 4 respectively ; while (a), though nowhere set out in terms, would appear to be covered satisfactorily by article 2 and the last clause m article 4.Ims^ treaty, therefore, although it was never intended to be exhaustive, is on sounder lines than our treaty with the Idrisi or our more informal arrangements with mg Husem, and there ought to be considerably less difficulty in expanding it, when ^±he tune comes, into a definitive treaty settling our relations with Bin Sand in detail. eie are, however, several positive points affecting British desiderata to which the present treaty appears to commit us :— (1 .)—Demarcation of Territories. In article 1 we recognise Bin Saud as independent ruler of certain enumerated countries “ and their dependencies and territories, which will be discussed and deter mined hereafter.” This is less explicit than our undertaking to the Idrisi (article 6 of Idrisi Treaty, tor which see Memorandum on British Commitments to the Idrisi), in which we under- take^ “ at the conclusion of the war to adjudicate between the rival claims of the Idrisi oaiyid and the Imam Yahya, or any other rival.” 1) . ^ comn )iI s us ty arbitrate on the territorial questions at issue between Bin baud and King Husein, and in the last resort to impose an effective sanction for our award. (2 .)—Keeping of the Peace. In the original trucial treaties with the Independent Chiefs of u Trucial Oman,” His Majestys Governments rights and obligations were strictly limited to the main- tcnance of peace at sea, and we did not attempt to control the mutual relations on land of the Arab parties to this series of treaties. This formula set a very desirable limit to His Majesty’s Government’s liabilities, while covering most of the causes of strife between the local Arab rulers. The trucial chiefs of^ Oman hold sway in a narrow strip of territory between the sea and an uninhabited desert. The activities of their subjects are almost wholly maritime, and there are no nomadic tribes in their area of jurisdiction to create difficulties of allegiance and demarcation. But it is evident that if the British trucial system, hitherto confined to the fringe between the south and east coasts and the great south-eastern desert, is to be extended, as it has been extended during the war, to the remainder of the Peninsula, we shall have to keep the peace between rulers whose prosperity depends, not upon the coasting trade or the pearl fisheries, but upon the command of inland oases and Bedouin tribes. . the Idrisi, and King Husein, with whom we have entered into relations during the war, are rulers of this latter kind. A “ Pax Britannica” in the Persian Gulf and the Bed Sea, valuable and indeed indispensable as it is, will do comparatively little to remove the causes of friction between them, or to enable His Majesty’s Government to deal effectively with such friction when it arises. . H are to keep the peace between them, we shall be driven eventually to control their relations with one another by land. To a certain extent this may be done by a maritime^ btyckacty. But apart from the fact that, where political authority is as lax as it is m Arabia, it is difficult to blockade one State effectively without blockading the whole Peninsula,* it is in the nature of things more difficult to bring pressure to bear on Hail or Er-Biadh by this method than on Sharjah, or even Maskat. Besides this, our new Arab Allies are considerably more powerful than most of the Arab rulers who have previously entered into a trucial relationship with us. And in the case of King Husein, who is likely to be the most troublesome of all over his relations with his neighbours, it is peculiarly difficult for His Majesty’s Government to exert pressure, whether by blockade or otherwise, owing to the sanctity of his territory in the eyes of the Moslem world, and the traffic of pilgrims between his ports and every other Moslem country. Ihe keeping of the peace on land thus appears to be the crucial problem in that extension of the British trucial system over the remainder of the Arabian Peninsula,, which has been carried a long way towards completion during the war. The Treaty with Bin Saud is our first experiment in this more highly-developed and difficult form of trucial relationship, and in their ruling on the Treaty a short time after its ratification (see above), the India Office laid down the important doctrine that we cannot admit that Article 2 is binding on us as against other Arabs.” On this ruling, our obligations to Bin Saud by land would be confined to securing him against aggression on the part of some outside Power {e.g., Turkey, Persia, * This seems a fair inductiou from our experiences during the war at Koweit. [939] EOermany, Russia, France) But ^ P arcaLn° iTuT^o^Uve fn^rveitrofagailst any other Arab ruler, such as King Husein, Wh ° Question, which affects all our new Ar^ relationships, a clear line of policy should be determined upon. ^ Srolltogatudal treaty with an Arab ruler, it has not^His Majesty^ Government’s custom to recognise it as binding the j ; t j in cases in wh i c h «*££&amp;£ t -1 .h. w ™ Memorandum onSsrCotSel to te GuTf ChL^^it ^h^dge” wffh should not too readdy be made into a general rule.APPENDIX. TEXT OF THE TREATY OF DECEMBER 26, 1915. In the Name of God the Merciful and Compassionate. Preamble. The High British Government on its own part, and Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Rahman-bin-Faisal Al-Saud, Ruler of Najd, El Hassa, Qatif and Jubail, and the towns and ports belonging to them, on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors, and tribesmen, being desirous of confirming and strengthening the friendly relations which have for a long time existed between the two parties, and with a view to consolidating their respective interests—the British Government have named and appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E., British Resident in the Persian Gulf, as their Plenipotentiary, to conclude a treaty for this purpose with Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Rahman-bin-Faisal Al-Saud.

Enclosed with foregoing, lo his Honour, ‘ the whole of the Arab nation without any exception have decided m tnese last years to live, and to accomplish their freedom and grasp the reins of -p nf mi ^ 1Stra u 10 - n tlle0I N an d practice; and whereas they have found and felt that it is to the interest of the Government of Great Britain to support them and aid them to the attainment of their firm and lawful intentions (which are based upon t le maintenance of the honour and dignity of their life) without any ulterior motives whatsoever unconnected with this object; And whereas it is to their (Arabs’) interest also to prefer the assistance of the Government of Great Britain in consideration of their geographical position and ec °? 1( ^ m . lc interests, and also of the attitude of the above-mentioned Government, which is known to both nations and therefore need not be emphasized; For these reasons the Arab nation sees fit to limit themselves, as time is short, to asking the Government of Great Britain, if it should think fit, for the approval, through her deputy or representative, of the following fundamental propositions, leaving out all things considered secondary in comparison with these, so that it may- prepare all means necessary for attaining this noble purpose, until such time as it finds occasion for making the actual negotiations:— Firstly - -England to acknowledge the independence of the Arab countries, bounded on the north by Mersina-Adana up to the 37° of latitude, on which degree [1378 t— 1 ] Bfalls Birijik, Urfa, Mardin, Midiat, Amadia Island, up to the border of Persia; on the east by the borders of Persia up to the Gulf of Basra; on the south by the Indian Ocean, with the exception of the position of Aden to remain as it is; on the wffit by the Red Sea, the Mediterranean Sea up to Mersina. England to approve f * the proclamation of an Arab Khalifate of Islam. 1 Secondly.—The Arab Government of the Sherif to acknowledge that England shall have the preference in all economic enterprises in the Arab countries whenever conditions of enterprises are otherwise equal. . Thirdly. Eor the security of this Arab independence and the certainty ot such preference of economic enterprises, both high contracting parties to offer mutual assistance to the best ability of their military and naval forces, to face any foreign power which may attack either party. Peace not to be decided without agreement of both parties. . _. x , ,, Fourthly.—If one of the parties enters upon an aggressive conflict, the other party to assume a neutral attitude, and in case of such party wishing the other to ioin’forces, both to meet and discuss the conditions. Fifthly. —England to acknowledge the abolition of foreign privileges in the Arab countries, and to assist the Government of the Sherif in an international Convention for confirming such abolition. ^ „ r Sixthly. —-Articles 3 and 4 of this Treaty to remain m vigour for 15 years, and, if either wishes it to be renewed, one year’s notice before lapse of treaty to be given. Consequently, and as the whole of the Arab nation have (praise be to God) agreed and united for the attainment, at all costs and finally of this noble ob.iect, they beg the Government of Great Britain to answer them positively or negatively in a period of 30 days after receiving this intimation; and if this period should lapse before they receive an answer, they reserve to themselves complete freedom of action.

McMahon to His Highness the Sherif Hosayn (titles), dated August 30, 1915. After compliments and salutations. WE have the honour to thank you for your frank expressions of the sincerity of your feeling towards England. We rejoice moreover that your Highness and your people are of one opinion, that Arab interests are English interests and English Arab. To this intent we confirm to you the terms of Lord Kitchener’s message, which reached you by the hand of Ali Effendi, and in which was stated clearly our desire for the Independence of Arabia and its inhabitants, together with our approval of the Arab Kaliphate when it should be proclaimed. We declare once more that His Majesty’s Government would welcome the resumption of the Kaliphate by an Arab of true race. With regard to the questions of limits, frontiers and boundaries, it would appear to be premature to consume our time in discussing such details in the heat of war, and while, in many portions of them, the Turk is up to now in effective occupation; especially as we have learnt, with surprise and regret, that some of the Arabs in those very 'parts, far from assisting us, are neglecting this their supreme opportunity, and are lending their arms to the German and the Turk, to the new despoiler and the old oppressor. Nevertheless we are ready to send to your Highness for the Holy Cities and the noble Arabs the charitable offerings of Egypt, so soon as your Highness shall inform us how and where they should be delivered. We are moreover arranging for this your messenger to be admitted and helped on any journey he may make to ourselves. Eriendly reassurances. Salutations. J (Signed) A. H.

T° J ]S Excellency the Most Exalted, the Most Eminent—The British High Commissioner in Egypt; may God grant him Success. iQ&gt;iQ^hih great 'h:: r, ': lnefS ? nr| delight I received your letter, dated 19th Shawal, IJdJ (doth August, 191o) and have given it great consideration and regard, in spite of the impression I received from it of ambiguity and its tone of coldness and hesitation with regard to our essential point. . ^ ^ ne( ?essary to make clear to your Excellency our sincerity towards the illustrious hhitish Empire, and our confession of preference for it in all cases and matters and under a orms and circumstances. The real interests of the followers of our religion necessitate this. s Nevertheless your Excellency will pardon me and permit me to say clearly that the coldness and hesitation which you have displayed in the question of the limits and boundaries by saying that the discussion of these at present is of no use and is a loss of time, and that they are still in the hands of the Government which is ruling them, &amp;c., might be taken to infer an estrangement or something of the sort. As these limits and boundaries demanded are not those of one person whom we s ou d satisfy, and with whom we should discuss them after the war is over but our ^• V6 T 611 the hfe of their new proposal is bound at least by these limits and their word is united on this. Therefore they have found it necessary to first discuss tfiis point with the Power m whom they now have their confidence and trust as a final appeal, viz., the illustrious British Empire. {Literal translation o f the above passage.) And therefore they saw the discussion in it first the place of then* confidence and trust the axis of final appeal now, and that is the illustrious British Empire.” Their reason for this union and confidence is mutual interest, the necessity of regulating territorial divisions and the feelings of their inhabitants, so that they may know how to base their future and hfe, so not to meet her (England ?) or any of her allies in opposition to their resolution which would produce a contrary issue, which God forbid. {Literal translation of above passage as follows) “ the fee l in gs of its inhabitants to know how to base their future and life for not to meet her or one of its allies in front of their resolution when the thing comes to a contrary result, which God forbid.” . For the object is, honourable Minister, the truth which is established on a basis which guarantees the essential sources of life in future. _ Yet within these limits they have not included places inhabited by a foreign race. It is a vam show of words and titles. May God have mercy on the Caliphate and comfort Moslems in it. am confident that your Excellency will not doubt that it is not I personally who am demanding of these limits which include only our race, but that they are all proposals of the people who, in short, believe that they are necessary for economic life, is this not right, your Excellency the Minister ? In a word your High Excellency, we are firm in our sincerity and declaring our preterence for loyalty towards you, whether you are satisfied with us as has been said or angry. With reference to your remark in your letter above mentioned, that some of our f^p r 7T d01 m g the r i utmost in promoting the interests of Turkey, your Goodness Ef fe ctnes . s ) would not permit you to make this an excuse for the tone of coldness and hesitation with regard to our demands, demands which I cannot admit that you as man o sound opinion will deny to be necessary for our existence ; nay, they are the essential essence of our life, material and moral. ’ ^ EX are theUp to the present moment I am myself, with all my might, carrying out in my country all thino-s in conformity with the Islamic law all things which tend to benefit the rest of the kingdom, and I shall continue to do so until it pleases God to order otherwise • In order to reassure vour Excellency, I can declare that the whole cc ^ry, together with those who you say are submitting themselves to Turco-German orders, are all waiting the result of these negotiations, which are dependent onlj' on your refusal or acceptance the question of the limits, and in your declaration of safe- guarding their religion first and then the rest of rights from any harm or danger. Whatever the illustrious Government of Great Britain finds conformable to its policy in this subject communicate it to us and specify to us the course we should In all cases it is only God 5 s will which shall be executed, and it is God who is the real factor in everything. _ _ With re ard o our demand for grain for the natives and the monies (surras) known to the Wakfs Ministry, and all other articles sent here with pilgrims’ caravan, 0 High Exc llency, my intention in this matter is to confirm your proclamations to the whole world, and especially to the Moslem world, that your antagonism is confined only to the party which has usurped the rights of the Caliphate, in which are included the rights of all Moslems. # ^ i . Moreover, the said gram is from the special Whkfs, and has notning to do with politics. . , if you think it should be, let the grain of the two years be transported in a special steamer to Jeddah in an official manner, in the name of all the natives as usual, and the captain of the steamer or the special “ Mamur ’ detailed as usual every year to hand it over on his arrival at the port, will send to the Governor of Jeddah asking for the Mamur of the grain at Jeddah, or a responsible official to take over the grain, amd give the necessary receipt signed by the said Mamur, that is, the Mamur of the gram himself. He should make it a condition that he would accept any receipt but that signed by this Mamur. Let the captain of the steamer or the “ Mamur” (detailed with the grain) should be instructed that if he finds anything contrary to this arrangement, he should warn them that he will return home with the cargo. Thereupon the Mamur and the special committee detailed with him, which is known as the committee of the grain for the natives, will take over the grain in the proper form.

McMahon, His Majesty's High Commissioner, Cairo, to the Sherif of Mecca, dated October 25, 1915. To the Sherif of Mecca (with titles). October 25, 1915. I HAVE received your letter of 29th Shawal with much pleasure, and your expressions of friendliness and sincerity have given me the greatest satisfaction. I regret that you should have received from my last letter the impression that I regarded the question of the limits and boundaries with coldness and hesitation ; such was not the case, hut it appeared to me that the moment had not yet arrived when they could he most profitably discussed. I have realised, however, from your last letter that you regard this question as one of vital and urgent importance. I have therefore lost no time in informing the Government of Great Britain of the contents of your letter, and it is with great pleasure that I communicate to you on their behalf the following statement, which I am confident you will receive with satisfaction. The districts of Mersina and Alexandretta and portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Hama, Homs, and Aleppo cannot be said to be purely Arab, and should be excluded from the proposed limits and boundaries. * *With the above modification, and without prejudice to our existing treaties with Arab chiefs, we accept those limits and boundaries and, in regard to those portions of the territories therein in which Great Britain is free to act without detriment to the interest^ of^ her ally France, I am empowered in the name of the Government of Great' ^itain to give the following assurances and make the following reply to your leiier i — Subject^ to the above modifications, Great Britain is prepared to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs within the territories included in the limits and boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca. Great Britain will guarantee the Hoiy Places against all external aggression and will recognise their inviolability. When the situation admits, Great Britain will give to the Arabs her advice, and will assist them to establish what may appear to be the most suitable forms of government m those various territories. On the other hand, it is understood that the Arabs have decided to seek the advice and guidance or Great Britain only, and that such European advisers and officials as ma ^ ke required for the formation of a sound form of administration will be British. With regard to the vilayets of Baghdad and Basra, the Arabs will recognise that the established position and interests of Great Britain necessitate special measures of administrative control, m order to secure these territories from foreign aggression, to promote the welfare of the local populations, and to safeguard our mutual economic interests. I am convinced that this declaration will assure you beyond all possible doubt of the sympathy of Great Britain towards the aspirations of her traditional friends the Arabs, and will result in a firm and lasting alliance, the immediate results of which wi e tiie expulsion of the^ Turks from the Arab countries and the freeing of the upon the ^ 68 ^ r ° m r ^ ur ^ s ^ 1 which for so many years has pressed heavily n ^n Ve con ^ nec ^ m y sf df in this letter to the more vital and important questions, and it there are any other matters dealt with in your letters which I have omitted to mention we may discuss them at some convenient date in the future. t was with very great relief and satisfaction that I heard of the safe arrival of the ~T. y yarpet and the accompanying offerings, which, thanks to the clearness of your directions and the excellence of your arrangements, were landed without trouble or mishap, in spite of the dangers and difficulties occasioned by the present sad war. May God soon bring a lasting peace and freedom to all peoples ! qu f ndm Sthis letter by the hand of your trusted and excellent messenger, Sheikh Mohammed Ibn Arif Arayfan, and he will inform you of various matters of interest, but of less vital importance, which I have hot mentioned in this letter. (Here follow the usual compliments.) A. HENRY McMAHON. (5.) Translation of a Letter from the Sherif of Mecca to Sir His Majesty's High Commissioner, Cairo, dated 27 el Hijj, 1333 [November 5, 1915], [literal translation.] (In the name of God the Merciful the Compassionate.) t *^ e m0st exa ^ e( i an d eminent Minister who is endowed with the WillT authont y and sou uduess of opinion. May God guide him to do His FTif ,eaSUre y ° U1 ' honoured letter &gt; dated 15th Zul Hijj l - Uh Uct °ber, 1915), to which I beg to answer as follows : - same'time lotv'T TfuT an a g reenie T u * ; and to render a service to Islam, and at the G , * av0Ic i a11 ma y cause Islam troubles and hardships—seeing moreover that we have great consrderation for the distinguished qualities and dispositirof the [1378 t—1] r6 -g-yp-a Government of Great Britain—we renounce our insistence on the inclusion of the vilayets of Messina and Adana in the Arab Kingdom. But the provinces of Aleppo and Beyrut and their sea-coasts are purely Arab provinces, and there is no difference between a Moslem and a Christian Arab | they are both descendants of one loie- father We Moslems will follow the footsteps of the Commander of the FaithfiC, Omar Ibn Khattab, ami other Khalifs succeeding him, who ordained in the laws of the Moslem faith that Moslems should treat the Christians as they treat themselves. He, Omar, declared with reference to Christians “ they will have the samp privileges and submit to the same duties as ourselves.” They will thus enjoy their civic rights in as much as it accords with the general interest of the whole nation. 2 . As the provinces of Irak are parts of the pure Arab Kingdom and were in fact the seat of its Governments in the time of Ali Ibn Abu Talib, and in the time of all Khalifs who succeeded him; and as in them began the civilisation of the Arabs, and as their towns in those provinces were the first towns built in Islam where the Arab power became so great ; therefore these provinces are greatly valued by all Arabs far and near, and their traditions cannot be forgotten by them. Consequently we cannot satisfy the Arab nations or make them submit to give up such a title to nobility. But in order to render an accord easy, and taking into consideration the assurances mentioned in the fifth article of your letter, to keep and guard our mutual interests in that country as they are one and the same, for all these reasons we might agree to leave under the British administration for a short time those districts now occupied by the British troops without the rights of either party being prejudiced thereby (especial y those of the Arab nation, which interests are to it economic and vital) and against a suitable sum paid as compensation to the Arab Kingdom for the period of occupation, in order to meet the expenses which every new kingdom is bound to support, at the same time respecting your agreements with the Sheikhs ot those districts, and especially those which are essential. 3 . In your desire to hasten the movement we see not only advantages, but grounds of apprehension. The first of these grounds is the fear of the blame of the Moslems of the opposite party, as has already happened in the past, who would declare that we have revolted against Islam and ruined its forces. The second is that, standing in the face of Turkey, which is supported by all the forces of Germany, we do not know what Great Britain and her Allies would do if one of the Entente Powers were weakened and obliged to make peace. We fear that the Arab nation will then be left alone in the face of Turkey together with her Allies, but we would not at all mind if we were to face the Turks alone. 'Therefore it is necessary to take these points into consideration in order to avoid a peace being concluded in which the parties concerned may decide the fate of our people as if we had taken part in the war without making good our claims to official consideration. 4 . The Arab nation has a strong belief that, after this war is over, the Turks, under German influence, will direct their efforts to provoke the Arabs and violate their rights, both material and moral, to wipe out their nobility and honour and reduce them to utter submission, as they are determined to ruin them entirely. The reasons for the slowness shown in our action have already been stated. 5 . When the Arabs know that the Government of Great Britain is their Ally, who will not leave them to themselves at the conclusion of peace in the face of Turkey and Germany, and that she will support and will effectively defend them, then to enter the war at once will, no doubt, be in conformity with the general interest of the Arabs. 6 . Our letter dated the 29th Shaual 1333 (9th September, 1915) saves us the trouble of repeating our opinions as to Articles 3 and 4 of your honoured last letter regarding administration, Government advisers and officials, especially as you have declared, O exalted Minister ! that you will not interfere with internal affairs. 7 . The arrival of a clear and definite answer as soon as possible to the above proposals is expected. We have done our utmost in making concessions in order to come to an agreement satisfying both parties. We know that our lot in this war will be either a success which will guarantee to the Arabs a life becoming their past history or destruction in the attempt to attain their objects. Had it not been for the determination which I see in the Arabs for the attainment of their objects, I would have preferred to seclude myself on one of the h'eights of a mountain, but they, the Arabs, have insisted that 1 should guide the movement to this end. May God keep you safe and victorious, as we devoutly hope and desire. (Unsigned.) Dated 27 el Rijj 1333 [November 5, 1915].Letter from Sir H. McMahon, His Majesty's High Commissioner, Cairo, to the Sherif of Mecca, dated December 14, 1915. To Sherif Hussein : (After customary greetings and acknowledgment of previous letter.) a gratified to observe that you agree to the exclusion of the vilayets of Mersina and Adana from the boundaries of the Arab territories. I also note with great pleasure and satisfaction your assurances that the Arabs are determined to act in conformity with the precepts laid down by Omar Ibn Khattab and the early Khalifs, which secure the rights and privileges of ail religions alike. In stating that the Arabs are ready to recognise and respect all our treaties with Arab chiefs, it is of course understood that this will apply to all territories included in the Arab kingdom, as the Government of Great Britain cannot repudiate engagements which already exist. ^ With regard to the vilayets of Aleppo and Beyrout, the Government of Great Britain have taken careful note of your observations, but, as the interests of our ally France are involved, the question will require careful consideration, and a further communication on the subject will be addressed to you in due course. The Government of Great Britain, as I have already informed you, are ready to give all guarantees of assistance and support within their power to the Arab kingdom, but then interests demand, as you yourself have recognised, a friendly and stable administi ation in the vilayet of Bagdad, and the adequate safeguarding of these interests calls for a much fuller and more detailed consideration than the present situation and the urgency of these negotiations permits. We fully appreciate your desire for caution, and we have no wish to urge you to hasty action, which might jeopardise the eventual success of your projects, but in the meantime it is most essential that you should spare no effort to attach all the Arab peoples to our united cause and urge them to afford no assistance to our enemies. It is on the success of these efforts and on the more active measures which the Arabs may hereafter take in support of our cause, when the time for action comes, that the permanence and strength of our agreement must depend. Under these circumstances I am further directed by the Government of Great Britain to inform you that you may rest assured that Great Britain has no intention of concluding any peace^ in ^ terms of which the freedom of the Arab peoples from German and Turkish domination does not form an essential condition. As an earnest of our intentions, and in order to aid you in your efforts in our joint cause, I am sending by your trustworthy messenger a sum of 20,000k (Customary ending.) (Signed) H. McMAHON. (7.)

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Cornpassionate! To his Excellency the eminent, energetic, and magnanimous Minister. WE received from the bearer your two letters, dated 9th Safar (17th December, 1915), with great respect and honour, and I have understood their contents, which caused me the greatest pleasure and satisfaction, as they removed that which had made me uneasy. \ our honour will have realised, after the arrival of Mohammed [Faroki] Sherif and his interview with you, that all our procedure up to the present was of no personal inclination or the like, which would have been wholly unintelligible, but that everything was the result of the decisions and desires of our peoples, and that we are but transmitters and executants of such decisions and desires in the position they (our people) have pressed upon us. [1378 t—1] D7 8 These truths are, in my opinion, very important, and deserve your honour's special attention and consideration. With regard to what had been stated in your honoured communication El Irak, as to the matter of compensation for the period of occupation, we, strengthen the confidence of Great Britain in our attitude and in our actions, really and veritably, and in order to give her evidence of our certainty and assurance in trusting her glorious Government, leave the determination of the amount to the perception of her wisdom and justice. As regards the northern parts and their coasts, we have already stated m our previous letter what were the utmost possible modifications, and all this was only done so to fulfi! those aspirations whose attainment is desired by the will of the Blessed and Supreme God. It is this same feeling and desire which impelled us to avoid what may possibly injure the alliance of Great Britain and France and the agreement made between them during the present war and calamities ; yet we find it our duty that the eminent Minister should be sure that, at the first opportunity after this war is finished, we shall ask you (what we avert our eyes from to-day) for what we now leave to France in Beyrut and its coasts. i i • 1 do not find it necessary to draw your attention to the fact that our plan is of greater security to the interests and presumption of the rights of Great Britain than it is to us ; and will necessarily be so, whatever may happen, so that Great Britain may finally see all her own peoples in that contentment and advancement which she is endeavouring to establish for them now, especially as her allies being neighbours to us will be the germ of difficulties and discussion with which there will be no peace of mind. In addition to which the people of Beyrut will decidedly never accept such isolations, and they may oblige us to undertake new measures which may exercise Great Britain, certainly not less than her present troubles, because of our belief and certainty in the reciprocity of our interests, which is the only cause that caused xis never to care to negotiate with any other Power but you. Consequently, it is impossible to allow any derogation that gives France, or any other Power, a span of land in those regions. I declare this, and I have a strong belief, which the living will inherit from the dead, in the declarations which you gave in the conclusion of your honoured letter. Therefore, the honourable and eminent Minister should believe and be sure, together with Great Britain, that we still remain firm to our resolution which Storrs learnt from us two years ago, for which we await the opportunity suitable to our situation, especially in view of that action the time of which has now come near and which destiny drives towards us with great haste and clearness, so that we and those who are of our opinion may have reasons for such action against any criticisms or responsibilities imposed upon us in future. Your expression—“ we do not want to push you to any hasty action which might jeopardise the success of your aim ”—does not need any more explanation, except what we may ask for when necessary, such as arms, ammunition, &amp;c. I deem this sufficient, as 1 have occupied much of your honour’s time. I beg to offer you my great veneration and respect. (Unsigned.)

That which took placets the agreement between Ibn Rashid.and the Sharif at the time of my fighting in Bhil-Qaadh 1336, and its confir mation is (to be found) in a letter dated Jamad 1337 (-March 1»19). In addition, the reports were confirmed from: reliable sources and by those who witnessed the same. On their arri val in the vicinity of Zubair and Kuwait, Ibn Tawalah and Ibn i.ithlin reported this and publicly declared that Ibn Rashid would fight Bin Saud and the reports must have been confirmed Wltn the Me3 0P°tamian Government. I am herewith enclosing copies of the recent agreement and the letters which, insha- Allah, you will be pleased to peruse. Besides the above, rbn Rashid trespassed and made an attack on the borders of Qasim and sent a messenger to the Sharif and afterwards he sent him JO camels u e °eject being to obtain from the Sharif aid in Q-riDS and s-nmiunition pto _• .. lou tnls 1-s the greatest profff of what I have'but you know if anybody makes a hostile move I am bound tc oppose him and if I oppose such a party and do not inform you i should be responsible and if I inform you the answer will s. e upon une par op causing such an affair and not upon me* As i e^drd.s Ihn Rashid, after his treachery and his evil p c t ions Shammar who live in the v iciaity of the J&amp;bal rose against him and also the inhabitants of Hail and said 'you are a trai- vOi, o.nd we will not fight Bin Saud, and if you are determined uyv n j.s , .73 will fight you, before Bin Saud fights yo u n , and subsequently a messenger came (to me) from them, saying that if Ibn Rashid desists ffom his action, we will appreciate it, otherwise, if he opposes us, we will fight him before you fight Vhsn Ibn Hashid learnt the reports about them, he sent me a norse-man apologising and saying ijtoaxX. that he was quite unaware and did not intend this (action against me) or my subjects, and that he wished for peace.

I, therefore, open sincere and secret negotiates with your Lordship for an unlimited period and in accordance with conditions, not included in the letter despatched to my lord Sherif Abd-ul-lah, hut which will be put up to you verbally, and will be explained by me. One of the terms of the agreement is that your resis- e, uo Ion Saud should be a permanent one and steps be taken to stop every material or moral help from reaching him; because he is known to be a traitor. He has been hostile to you and to every Arab who strives to raise his race. We, therefore, should join and rise, each on his own side, against mm and against other factions who have deserted the Holy faith. We can thus attain our fundamental object which is the realization of unity of purpose amongsfArab Tribes. The second condition is that you should assist so that all 8mammar tribes may come to his (Ibn Rashid) Standard with the understanding that he will be the sole authority from whom Permission for obtaining provisions will emanate, and that the Seals of the Shaikhs who had deserted him in the l-ttoo suer as Saud Es-Salih, Ibn Tuala and Skab ibn Ajla will not be honoured. m short every person who may claim to belong to Shammar, be he from Mesopotamia or A1 Hassa up to this xsds» region, should not be allowed to take provisions '' v0e}Jb a written Permission bearing his (Ibn Rashid)Seal.( 2 ) A1 Hai’t, Teirna and Khaib&amp;r, on condition that he will fulfil your wish by disallcv/ing any assistance to be given to the Turks by sending them provisions and other things. The fourth condition he (Ibn Rashid) has been asked to assist in the rising against the Turks. At present he is unable to display hostility before they (Turks) violate their promise and until he (Ibn Rashid) has obtained his de mands from them. Opening of negotiations and presenting necessary demands, depend on acceptance of these conditions. On re ceipt of letters which denote acceptance of these conditions Official correspondence will then start and detailed letters conta.ining all the terms will be submitted.

I have the honour to state that I have always been looking forward to gam the satisfaction of His Majesty the King and avoiding matters contrary to that policy; but wicked, interesoea, and jealous persons have continuously been causing nostiie movements. Wtfere it a matter concerning them and ourselves only I would not have attached the least importance to their movements. Bui as the Great Government is the intermediary I have always been taking care to give her satisfaction and to maintain sincerity in my communications to and action in respect ox thi^aid Government. It is known to you that when the Sharif took Medina, I informed the ^reat Government that he intends to move against me and means to send one of his sons towards my territory. When I received a communication from H.M’s Government purport ing that the matter had no truth I accepted it as true. And then took place the late movements ol the Sharif with the result that you know. Let us thank God who is the best protector. Ana in ohese days I have received reliable information that a delegate of the Sharif went to Ibn Rashid and a meeting took place which was attended by headmen of the Shammar and 2aidan together with Bin Hithlain and other notables of 'Ajmaac The object of the meeting was that the Sharif has asked Kelp of Ibn Rashid and that he intends to come to an agreement witn ion Rashid so that he and Shammar and ^jman should i'ighl iuts and he (Sharif) has undertaken to pay T £ 50,000/- ^ SUPPly ar “ S aiS ° all0 * al09S tribal- —mMam How as regards this parley, it is true beyond doubt, but as regards their final determination to do anything, I have not received authentic? information which, however, is bound to reach us. As regards Ibn Hashid, peace and treaty obligation exist between him and myself# If he remains true, God be praised, but if he commits a breach, then he will get the v/orst of it and I do not attach any importance to him. As regards Ai-Ajmen I icnow that His Majesty* s Government has given me permission to deal with them and I shall certainly punish them for their misdeeds, as they have recently been constantly raiding my tribesmen ana robbing (property) and hilling (men) and I am going to punish theia soon. The reason why I submitJ&amp;s matter, uhat is Ibn Hashid T s ana the others*, is that I regard it as my duty to inform His Majesty^ Govern ment oi what interests and affects me. But the object, the whole wfcgfb -obj act, is the Sharif and his attitude. If the affair concerned only him and myself, then I should regard it extremely light, but my aim is to follow the wishes of His Majesty the Hing-Bmperor and to abide by the understanding between me and His Majesty's Government and because I am afraid any movements may tajce place from his side or on account of causes created by him and the responsibility may fail on me for not informing His Majesty's Government. I, therefore, request you to communicate (this) to the Hon'ble Civil Commissioner Baghdad for submitting to His Majesty's Government; that I may either be given a complete guarantee regarding the Sharif that no movement whatever shall taxe place from his side until the question pending between him and myself is finally settled through your Government, be it after a month or ten years, or else I may be given an answer so that I may looh alter my own affairs and be prepared in ox’der that I may not be responsible if any thing happens by the will of God, as the result of any movement etc. Imovements or the Sharir which are many, some or which may ^gam their object ana. others may rail, j have therefore inr**. hastenea to inform you before any thing happens so that I may remain easy in mina protect my country ana my subjects ana be free from anything in the way of remonstrance or reproaoh coming on me from the siue of His Majesty's Sovernment. i now request you to oomey the above speeaily, ana to as* lor early reply, for at present there is great commotion in Mejd while I have been holding baom the inhabitants or Kajd, and treating adverse reports as false. Ana, sod willing, neither I nor any or my tribesmen will mane any movement till I receive a reply from Government unless we are attacked in our own homes when we cannot forbear. And 1 assure you that I love to be at peace with ail, ana especially, with the Sharif, except in a matter in which there is no helping and no alter native, then God's will be done. I am anxiously waiting for a lepiy enu hoping that His Majesty's Government will consider the matter ±‘uiiy.

I am, &amp;c. L. D. WAKELY. Enclosure in No. 1. Note read to India Office and Foreign Office Joint Conference on behalf of Bin Saud by Ahmad-ibn-Thunaiyan, November 1, 1919. (Translation.) AS your Excellencies are aware, after the occurrence of the regrettable clash between the subjects of Ibn Saud and Shereef Abdullah, His Majesty’s Government sent an official representation through their consul at Jedda to the effect that Ibn Saud and the Ikhwan had in defiance of the counsels of His Majesty’s Government committed an act of aggression against the boundaries of the Hedjaz, that, if he did not retire and withdraw his troops from the Hedjaz, His Majesty’s Government would treat him as an enemy and sever relations with him and discontinue his subsidy. Ibn Saud was distressed by the tenour of this representation and said : “ What has caused His Majesty s Government to write thus ? ” seeing that he had frequently informed His Majesty s Government of the attitude of the Shereef and his acts of aggression against the territories of Nejd, and had gone so far as to request the despatch of a mission to solve the difficulties existing between him and the Shereef, declining responsibility therefore, and His Majesty’s Government made no answer until the affair occurred, owing to the aggression of the Shereef against the territories of Nejd. He was disturbed at heart because he was hoping for suitable assistance from His Majesty’s Government in accordance with the tenour of the agreement made between them and him, against all acts of aggression which may occur against his territories by land or sea.^ And when the subjects of Ibn Saud drove the Shereef from the frontiers of his territories, he did not commit aggression against the Hedjaz, his only object being to please His Majesty’ Government, and on our arrival in London we learned that His Majesty s Government had sent Mr. Philby by air to meet Ibn Saud, and had sent him a written communication to that effect, which did not reach him, while Mr. Philby returned. Now the requests of Ibn Saud are as follows :— 1. The question of the protection of his independence and the avoidance of any interference in his internal affairs, and the realisation of all the provisions mentioned in the preliminary agreement and its ratification anew on both sides with a view to giving effect to it. 2. If you honour us by asking us regarding the boundaries of Nejd, they are patent : to north-west Hanakiyya, to the south thereof Ashaira and the Hadhm range, and that which is beyond it (looking) from the Hedjaz, according to the dictum of the | 1378 p—1]prophet: &lt;f Whose beholdeth the Hadhm is in Nejd” ; and to the east of it Khurma and Turaba, and Eanya, and Bisha, and Tathlith. And we request His Majesty’s Government again, as we have done before and frequently, to send a commission to delimit the boundary ; if it is not sent the above are our boundaries, as we have explained in accordance with the instructions of Ibn Baud, and whoso transgresses them Ibn Baud will be bound to defend himself against him. ^ r 3. The question of the removal of the embargo on pilgrims from the people of Nejd. This year we abandoned the Haj at the request of His Majesty’s Government, but if it is forbidden for the future we shall be obliged to perform _ the Haj as of obligation, and therefore we beg His Majesty’s Government to make suitable arrange ments, and we guarantee that there will be no disturbance by the subjects of Ibn Baud during the Haj in the territory of theHedjaz, and we beg His Majesty’s Government to take a guarantee from the Hedjaz Government that it will obstruct our subjects during the Haj. 4. The question of the enhancement of the original _ temporary subsidy and its continuance in perpetuity for the rehabilitation of his territories from the rum caused by internal wars and during their their occupation by the Turks, and on their behalf by Ibn Rashid for a period of nearly fifty years. 5. The question of the demarcation of the boundary and of the despatch of Mr. Philby to Ibn Baud as desired by the latter as political agent empowered for the solution of this problem and other kindred problems, and for the purpose of personal discussion with Ibn Baud, as he has some knowledge of our conditions and those of our neighbours, whether States or cities, seeing that he has been long in Arabia.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s i EASTERN.

J mit evidence obtained from notables in Jeddah and in Mecca (some of them a q T 3 . ; r .° 1 m tax eollectors of the l urkish Government, greybeards of the Buqum and bubai tribes, and others is unanimous on the point that Khurma district for opera tions has been under the jurisdiction of the Emirs of Mecca, with the exception of the period during which the holy cities were occupied by the Wahabis early in the nineteenth century. J 3. Assuming Ibn Sand’s contention to be correct, io follows that the Emirs of Jxburma are subjects of, and owe allegiance to, Ibn Saud alone, and it is relevant to consider how far the conduct of Emir Khali-ibn-Eluwai has been consistent with such alleged allegiance. 4. Late in 1916 King Hussein, hearing that Khalid was getting too enthusiastic about the recently formed Akhwan, sent him orders to come to Mecca ; he came, and v»as kept under “ open arrest ” as he refused to return to the orthodox fold. Ak ^ be r . e( l uest Emir Abdulla he was allowed to go to the former’s camp at Wadi Ais, where I met him in April 1917. Emii Abdulla states that he had long talks with Khalid about the Akhwan sect, and towards the end of 1917 —being satistied with the latter’s professions of loyalty— o Dtamed the reluctant consent of King Hussein to the return of Khalid to resume his duties as Emir of Khurma. 5. With lefeience co the Cadis of Khurma, I offer the following remarks :— After the suppression of the Wahabi revolt early in the nineteenth century, a proportion of the inhabitants of several villages, amongst them Khurma, cluno- to the new faith (Wahabism). - &amp; The Wahabi belong to the Hambali division of the Moslem religion, and owing to t ie number of Wahabis in Khurma the Emirs of Mecca usually appointed a Hambali as the official cadi. Emir Abdulla informs me that the present cadi is from Wadi Dawasir, and was appointed in the ordinary course by the Emir of Mecca (King Hussein), who paid his salary and those of his assistants. It is not impossible that the cadi also received some salary from Ibn Saud. In 1917 it was reported to King Hussein that the cadi was preaching the Wahabi creed, &amp;c. He was ordered to Mecca, where he was given a serious lecture by King r 1 eturned to his P ost at Khurma. As he still continued preaching the •Vahab 1 faith, he was sent for to Mecca a second time, and appears to have satisfied King Hussein with his protestations of loyalty, &amp;c. [555 cc—1]2 However on returning to Khurma the second time, the cadi threw off all pretence However, on returning ^ ;oug enthuslasm gamed many adherents. 0I ”t o'?S..wn-w-ed«* him to take up his duties or to recognise his appointment, and openly hadjoinedthe Akhwan ibn ^ rul ; ng a t of the latter’s territory wouki lbn Saud have quietly acquiesced in an important official of his being and appointed by him, would he have kept quiet knowing that complaintTto His MajSy'sGovern- al l o ^such^flagrant a^ertion n ^at e *IDiaHd n is' o^'of Ibn Sand’s governors on the statement that Khahd was m receipt of some salary from Ibn Sand before his revolt. This is bv no means unlikely ; indeed, it is probable that when Khalid joined the Akhwan, Ibn Sand paid him some sort o stipend for propaganda and pohtkal purposes, a financial investment which has Foved h^h y profile, 10 Soon after Khalid raised the standard of revolt, Mi. Hhilby passed tnrou Khurma (December 1917), and it is interesting to note how the situation to him or, the spot.. In the account of his journey from Riadh to iaif fArab bulletin No. 81, page 74, dated 9th March, 1919), Mr. Philby writes as follows:— “ Khurma is inhabited mainly by Subai tribesmen, who at the moment of our arrival were all out in the desert, leaving the village to their slaves and women and to the Jew merchants, mainly representing Washm, who reside here in connection the he'cause of the^Wus of the tribesmen with the local Emir—a shereef—appeared to be that the latter had incurred the displeasure of the Shereef of Mecca by emhi aem| the Wahabi faith or perhaps had embraced the W ahabi faith hecaiibe ne ha . tt shereef’s displeasure, alid that the Shereef of Mecca has commissioned he hmir of Turaba and the Buqum tribe to attack the rebels of Khurma as occasion offered “The'place was therefore virtually m a state of siege m the sense that no exit wa allowed to L people in the direction of the Hedjaz, while the warriors of the S U, and Buqum were trying to out-manoeuvre each otiier in the vast plains be h) y and the Hadhu hills.” It will be noted that Mr. Philby writes of the “ rebels of Khunna.” Thus Khalid and those inhabitants of Khurma who revolted with him were described to ill. flu &gt; ^ b Mr S Biadh for some time. His escort was imposed of Neidis supplied by Ibn Saud, and it is probable, though 1 have no information o - STthatVi Saud sent a responsible sheikh or a member oi^is entourage wffh h&gt;m ‘ When passing through Khurma,district Mr. Philby records the fact ^ given to him at the time, that the Emir and some of the inhabitants of Khurma open ^lebelho^u against canllot c orrectly be described as lieing ‘ l state 01 revolt against King Hussein if it forms an integral part of Ibn Sands dommion, ^ ^ Surely if Khurma belonged to Nejd some one member of the escort 01 sheikh or Arab would have informed Mr. Philby of the fact. . . Kh qq 11 As I have frequently pointed out, the Khurma episode has its origin m Khafict joining the Akhwan movement and eventually openly revolting.? \ n ito rof yas Kino Hussein vY;as fully occupied at the time with the; war against the Turks and miscalculating the strength of the revolt, twice sent a hopelessly inadequate force to put it down. Both were defeated, and, owing to our insistence, King Hussein remained on the defensive, and no further attacks were made by him. ' , t 12 ' , Ib ’ 1 Saud&gt; see \ n S Khalid had established himself (and undoubtedly the two had corresponded and arrived at an understanding), laid claim to Khurma; he now lays claim to luraba and should the Emir and a sufficient number of the inhabitants of Tad join the Akhwan movement, a serious claim to that town would not be unexpected. tti • 0 A n L° S , U ? ai ^ heikhs (Misharidbn-Nasir) came to Jeddah last month with +1 17 • H6 . s , t f tes th f t trib f has always belonged to the Hedjaz, and been n er the Emirs of Mecca; he himself has left the country because of his aversion to e Akhwan seek and his tribesmen have become Akhwan bv force of circumstances; an Arab strongly objects to leaving his own country, and as remaining entails sudden death or an outward profession of the Akhwan faith, it is not surprising that the latter is the course usually taken. &amp; feel it my duty to again emphasise the fact that it is impossible for Kmg Elussem to accept arbitration on the question of the ownership of Khurma. If lie did his prestige would suffer a very severe blow, while Ibn Saud’s would be correspondingly increased.* Should His Majesty’s Government insist on the ownership of Khurma being made a subject lor arbitration I have little doubt (Emir Abdulla ami others have none) that King Hussein would abdicate, a course which would almost certainly be followed by genera anarchy m the Hedjaz; Emir Abdulla, the Grand Cadi of Mecca, and all other notables 1 nave consulted are convinced on this point. I maintain that it is common knowledge in Central Arabia that Khurma belono-s to the J-iedjaz, and if its ownership is arbitrated upon by His Majesty’s Government Akhwan shares would certainly boom. 14. King Hussein has times innumerable warned us of the dangers of the Akhwan movement ; both the Idnssi and ibn Rashid are beginning to realise and fear them, and ot i appear wdling to co-operate with King Hussein in preventing further infiltration o Akhwan propaganda into their countries. Indications of a growing nervousness in oweit and Iraq are also not wanting (see recent reports circulated by Bagdad). Id. In our own interests the only course open to His Majesty’s Government is to adhere strictly to their frequently-expressed decision that they regard Khuima as being vMthm the dominion of King Hussein; any other course is fraught with grave daimer to Britisn interests. » &amp; &amp; 16. With regard to the fixing of the Hedjaz-Kejd boundary, it will, in my opinion be many years before any Boundary Commission could work on the ground, and at any time tiie erection of boundary marks Would be a useless expenditure. , u aieetyig between duly authorised representatives of each side should be arranged to be held at Cairo Koweit, or some suitable place p an impartial British official with a / 10V \ 6 hr at • rclb | c ’ ^ ommander Hogarth, C.M.G., would be appointed arbitrator by His Majesty s Government with or without assistants and decide on the tuture boundary. • r ^ 1 an( ^ 1 tbe Emir Abdulla were the representatives at such a meeting I am arrived at ° t iere W ° Uld ^ a - g0 ° d chance of ai] amica ble agreement being 17.

Alienby to Earl Curzon.—(Received June 20.) (No. 269.) My Lord, Cairo, June 11, 1919. WITH reference to my telegram No. 950 of the 10th June, I have the honour to forward one copy of a note by Captain Garland, of the Arab Bureau, on the “ Khurma dispute.” I have, &amp;c. E. H. H. ALLENBY. Enclosure In No. 1. NoteJy Captain Garland, of the Arab Bureau, on the Khurma Dispute between King Hussein and Ibn Saud. Ibn Baud. IN 1915 a treaty was arranged between Emir Ibn Saud and His Britannic Majesty’s Government, in which the latter recognised Ibn Saud as the independent sovereign of Nejd, El Hasa, Catif, and Jubail. It was a temporary agreement made chiefly for reasons of military expediency after the expulsion of the Turks, and no . definite boundaries of the territory were specified. Ikhwan. Although generally regarded as a new creation, the Ikhwan or Brotherhood move- ment is really a fevival in an intensified form of Wahabism, the great puritanical revolt against Orthodox Mohammedanism in the 18th century, which was ultimately crushed by the Egyptian troops under Mohammed Ali in 1817, and which, since then, has existed in a merely moribund state chiefly within the confines of Nejd. The tenets of the Ikhwan creed are very similar to those of Wahabism, thouoh its followers are without doubt more fanatical. To the non Moslem, however, it is the brutal methods of effecting conversions and of punishing sinners, rather than the principles of the creed itself, that appear objectionable. There is no doubt whatever that the Bedouin are systematically terrorised into conversion, and that those who refuse are done to death. In war, the Ikhwan are said to take no prisoners, but to cut the throats of all who fall into their hands. It has been stated repeatedly that Ibn Saud had no connection with the Ikhwan movement in its early stages, and this is probably true, but it is now sufficient for our present purposes to know, firstly, that the sect originated close by his own capital, and was allowed to flourish there, and its leading missionaries are his own subjects ; secondly, that it is merely a desperately fanatical edition of Wahabism, of which he is the acknowledged leader ; and, thirdly, that Ibn Saud has recently put himself at the head of the movement, and will certainly not fail to use it for furthering his own ends. For the purposes of this review, therefore, it is unnecessary to differentiate between Ibn Saud and the Ikhwan, or between the latter and the Wahabis. Since the first appearance of the Ikhwan, about ten years ago, in the vicinity of the Nejd capital, Biadh, it has made rapid progress. It is practically certain that the whole of Nejd is Ikhwan, and its missionaries have penetrated to all the corners of Arabia. But its doctrines are detested by all orthodox Moslems, and the rulers of the Arab States surrounding Nejd (especially King Hussein) live in constant dread of its spread to their people. •e 2 Khurma Dispute. The present Khurma crisis has two causes, one religious, the other political. The religious cause is the King’s determination to stop Ikhwan sectarian propaganda in the Hejaz; the political cause is the dispute as to the actual ownership of the Khui a district. King Hussein has put forward a very good case in proof of his ownership of Khurma, and this, after much delay, has received the support of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, but Ibn Saud, who bases his claim more upon the allegiance of the population of the Khurma district than on ownership of the actual ground, agreed that the quarrel should be submitted to our arbitration. The territorial dispute has its origin in the conversion to Wahabism, in 1914, of the King’s local representative at Khurma, a Sherif named Khalid, whom the King- appointed Emir of Khurma before the war. By embracing Wahabism, Khalid became a rebel, and for four years the King appears to have taken no steps to rectify the position at Khurma or to collect his taxes there. In 1918, however, he sent tax gatherers, but they were arrested by Khalid, who, realising that his action meant war, collected a scrap Bedouin force with which he ejected all loyal elements from Khurma. In May 1918, the King drew our attention to Ibn Baud’s ‘‘oppression and encroachment on tribes bound firmly to the Emirs of Mecca from ancient times,” and said that, in consequence, he had been compelled to send a force to Khurma. This force consisted of about 800 Bedou under Sherif Hamud, a brother of Emir Shakir, and though it was claimed to have restored order soon after its arrival at Khurma, the King sent reinforcements in June, consisting of 82 men, 2 old guns, and 2 machine guns. This force was surprised by a party of Ikhwan, losing fourteen killed and all its guns. Military Incidents. Following this defeat, Emir Shakir was despatched by the King to the Khurma district with about 800 men and 4 guns and 6 machine guns. The King stated that he was to occupy Khurma as Emir of Ateibah tribe (Khurma is Ateibah territory). Shakir’s force ultimately arrived at Marran. The next military incident was an attack by a loyal Ateibah sub-tribe (the Miqatah) under their Sheikh, Shulefwih, against the Ikhwan in Khurma, but they were utterly routed. This attack was probably, though not necessarily, instigated by Shakir. In August, Shakir moved from Marran and met the Ikhwans at Hannu Wells, 16 miles east of Khurma, where his force was annihilated. It was reported that during the conflict one of the Ateibah tribal sections (the Ruqa) deserted e 7 i masse to the Ikhwan. Each side was blaified by the other as the aggressor in this action, but it was undoubtedly the result of Shakir’s advance from Marran, which may not, however, have been intended aggressively by him. Up to this time Ibn Saud, pronouncing the King the aggressor in every incident, declined to be responsible for his men at Khurma, though he affirmed that he himself would not intervene. In spite, however, of Ibn Baud’s repeated denials of lending support to Khalid and the Ikhwan, he cannot be absolved. Khalid, undoubtedly, was acting as his agent, and looked to him for guidance and help. In fact, a letter written to Ibn Saud by Khalid, after the Hannu Wells fight, and which was seen by Mr. Philby, contained a full report of the action, and stated that the captured guns were being kept pending the orders of Ibn Saud as to disposal. This defeat necessitated the despatch of further reinforcements to Emir Shakir, and accordingly more guns and machine guns v T ere sent from Abdullah’s camp, but, except for minor raids by the Ikhwan, on caravans taking supplies from Taifto Shakir’s base, there were no military incidents for some time. The King and Abdullah continually repeated their promises to keep to defensive measures only, and denied all aggressive intentions. In one of the raids Abdullah’s son had a narrow escape, and the Ikhwan captured all his belongings. This incensed Abdullah, and he is known by the writer to have made up his mind at that time to obtain his revenge as soon as an opportunity occurred ; he was itching to move Khurmawards in person. But although the King and Abdullah had been warned consistently by us to avoid ao-uressive acts or even an advance on Khurma, it must be emphasised that this policy of ours was dictated purely by military expediency, and was decided upon in spite of our strong sympathy with the King’s claim to Khurma. It was realised that theSheri flans could spare neither commanders, troops, nor guns from the forces which were besieging Medina, and further, that a big defeat at Khurma at that time would probably r-ult m a disastrous reaction on the siege operations by heartening Fakhri Pasha and enabling him to come to some arrangement with Ibn Saud for the further defence of ye city or for surrendering it to the Ikhwan. .. kittle was done, however, by India to call off Ibn Saud or to order him to cease his anti-Shenfian propaganda amongst Hejaz tribes. The Indian view at that time was that it would be wrong for us to support the King in military action against our treaty Ally, ibn baud, and rt was not until March 1919 that a message was sent by His Majesty s Government to Ibn Saud, “ advising him to modify' his attitude and to persuade his followers from further opposition to the administrative measures of Kino- Hussein at Khurma. * The fall °f Medina, in January 1919, left Abdullah free to set out on his lono-- cherished expedition to Khurma, which, he had often prophesied, would be over with the complete destruction of Ibn Sand’s forces, within two days of his (Abdullah’s) arrival on the scene. y ... ™ feared b J British advisers on both sides (Iraq and Egypt) that Abdullah’s dl-advised move must inevitably result in a collision of the rival forces, and it is quite probable that had Abdullah remained in Medina the present crisis would not have ansen. Indeed,^had we been aware of the Emir’s actual warlike intentions, we should no doubt have strongly protested against the advance instead of merely sugo-estino- the . impropriety of it. Abdullah’s regular force consisted of 60 officers, 770 other ranks 10 S f AhO ^ f? maCilr p e r ® ached Asheirah early in April. As soon as he learned of Abdullah s move from Medina, Ibn Saud began counter preparations. He certainly warned His Britannic Majesty’s Government of these, and, reasserting his wish for arbitration, stated that he was compelled by pressure of public opinion to take measures against aggression by the Shenfian troops. “ If the King and Abdullah will remain in auJ u W w P a S ’ he said ’.“ Iwi11 remam in mine.” But although we looked upon Abdullah s advance as unwise and foolhardy, and advised him not to start we do not and cannot, deny his right to occupy Khurma. E ie next mi litany incident was a raid by Ikwan (as reported by Abdullah) on 7 a l 1 ^ S 7 Begheihjah early in May 1919. The raiders were pursued by a detachment o Abdullah s who failed to overtake them, but intercepted and defeated a second iwan party, said to be en route to attack a Sherifian post at Madarmab. About the same date, another detachment of Ikhwan was attacked at Kadheim by a patrol of Abdullah, s and routed, whilst sleeping, by a hand-grenade bombardment. Of these raids we have not yet received reports from Ibn Sand’s side. On the 21st Abdullah reported that, after two and a half hours’ fighting he occupied Tarabah and that after consolidating it, he would advance to Khurma In that report Abdullah stands self-condemned. He had obviously scrapped his defensive policy and doubtless decided to take the Ikhwan raid on Degheibjah as bis excuse for an attack on Tarabah. . Abdullah also reported the arrival in person of Ibn Saud at Sakphah (80 miles north-east of Khurma). 1 v ,. be sure i^ I bn Saud does not deny that the Ikhwan raid on Degheibjah ever took place, he will certainly assert that it was not done at his instigation and was, therefore, an ordinary tribal raid for which he cannot be held responsible. Auu 1 °* tbe Ikhwan, under Emir Khalid, attacked Abdullah at larabah, driving him out, and, according to several accounts, destroyed his iegu ar force, capturing all its guns and machine guns. Emir Abdullah got away with 500 Regular mountecl men only, and retired to Okheidir. Later information &gt;s mws that bherif Sharaf (Abdullah’s second in command) had a small force at Kelaikh, v uc he Ikhwan attacked at dawn on the 26th May, but were repulsed, Sharaf &lt;i tei wards decided to join Abdullah at Okheidir. The retirement on this 1 latter place was probably necessary to protect the Sherifial base at Asheirah. ith the destruction of Abdullah’s army, the road from Khurma to Taif lies open to the enemy.^ Mecca and even Jeddah are at the mercy of the fanatical iwan. from Medina, Emir Ali can only send reinforcements of the same fio-htino- value as Abdullah’s original force. ° &amp; Results. j 5 ] a Sa&lt; ^ ever y conflict with the Ikhwan, the Sherifian forces have' ‘een badly defeated.

On 28th August, 1919, the Under Secretary of State noted (vide P.4641) that Foreign Office should he addressed as to the demarcation of the boundary which Ibn Saud was entitled to claim under his treaty with us. But on P.4141 of 22nd July it had been noted that 'arbitration is off'; and in Foreign Office (P.4340) telegram to General Allenby, it was stated that 'King Hussein has refused H.M.G’s offer of arbitration.' 2 . It seems however that the arbitration which King Hussein refused was only the intervention of lir.Philby in active hostilities about to break out between the two parties. There seems to be nothing on the file to show any alteration from the position as it was on 25th February, 1919, when Mr .Shuckburgh I noted that 'King Hussein had neither declined nor accepted ’ arbitration.

We also informed the Political Agent at Bahrein of our negotiations with the Hedjaz Government and requested him to submit our petition to Eis Majesty's Government, but we never got a reply ana meanwhile the Sherif intruded on our soil; and his troops, equipped with arms ana munitions, crossed our boundaries* We again communicated with His Majesty's Government requesting them to asx the Hedjaz Government to refrain from in l r’doi on ana bran agression. I cannot maxe out why His Majesty's Government aid neither reply nor taxe any action. »e expected assistance in accordance with the text of our treaty. I also wrote a reply to His Majesty's Government's note ana despatched it through Col. Wilson, p.A. at Jeddah. A copy of the same reply was also sent to the authorities in Iraq through the Political Agent at Bahrein. Je were continually anxious lest any unpleasant occur rence might take place ana consequently I requested His Majesty's Government to solve the problem and aecide whether we were right or wrong.? JU&gt; J ~ (ySy As stated above we have always been in fear of acoiaentE because the HedjaE Government are continually intruding on our if.V/.frontier which coincides with that of Medina. % I therefore wish to be informed whether our neighbour ing states are enjoying British Protection or Alliance ana if so to request His Majesty* s Government to asic them to cease hostilities with us and. intrusion on our territories. If they are not under British Protection nor Allied to Britain, that also I must Jtnow, because we wish to avoid anything that might provoke unrest. We also desire to enjoy the friendship of the British Government. I therefore request that steps be taicen to settle this case. I expect an early reply with the good news of your well being.

And you further advise me to prevent all movements from my side in that direction until the final settlement of the matter is made; for this I am much obliged as I had no (ulterior) object in all the previous actions and have no longer any desire in the places — mentioned above; but on the other hand they are evacuated for those reasons and I have no desire to act against the Hedj&amp;z Government, which is very much esteemed by me; and these differences were caused only by their (Hedjaz Govt. r s) previous and late movements, as already stated in my communications to the officials of His Majesty 1 s Government. I now undertake to your Honour that no movement what soever will be made in those places by sny of my tribesmen on condition that the Hedjaz Government will likewise desist from all movements of which you are well aware. As regards my intimation to the respected Colonel Wilson, His Majesty's Agent at Jeddah, that the inhabitants of Uejb will proceed to Holy Mecca for the performance of pilgrimage this year, it is exactly as I had informed him, that is, they were maxing preparations for this purpose; but in accordance with your request in the name of His Majesty's Government, I have issued a warning to all the inhabitants of Heja to give up the intention of performingf (Sf&lt;A the pilgrimage until next year and I have issued stringehlf orders to the Amirs in my territories in order tha*t they may inform my subjects and I myself shall remain in my territory since my friends His Majesty 1 s Government have themselves given complete assurance to see that the Sharif does not advance to any of those places which v/ere the cause of dispute.

Colonel Wilson to Major Young .—( ■ugMst 26f)sia» l My dear Young, The Rest, Ellington Road,7*aplow, Bucks, August 23, 1919. I SEND you herewith some notes on the ownership of Khurma which I wrote on my way home. , . 1 would be very much obliged if you would kindly bring them to the notice of the authorities concerned. I regard this question of Khurma as being of very special importance/ and it merits the serious consideration of His Majesty’s Government at an early date. Sincerely yours, C. E. WILSON. Enclosure in No. 1. Some Notes on the Ownership of Khurma. 1. THE Emir Ibn Saud claims that Khurma is within the boundaries of his Emirate of Nejd. As far as I am aware, practically no evidence has been produced by Ibn Saud to substantiate his claim. 2. All the evidence obtained from notables in Jeddah and in Mecca (some of them Wahabis), from tax collectors of the Turkish Government, greybeards of the Buqum and Subai tribes, and others is unanimous on the point that Khurma district for genera tions has been under the jurisdiction of the Emirs of Mecca, with the exception of the period during which the holy cities were occupied by the Wahabis early in the nineteenth century. / 3. Assuming Ibn Saud’s contention to be correct, io follows that the Emirs of Khurma are subjects of, and owe allegiance to, Ibn Saud alone, and it is relevant to consider how far the conduct of Emir Khali-ibn-Eluwai has been consistent with such alleged allegiance. 4. Late in 1916 King Hussein, hearing that Khalid was getting too enthusiastic about the recently formed Akhwan, sent him orders to come to Mecca ; he came, and was kept under “ open arrest ” as he refused to return to the orthodox fold. At the request of Emir Abdulla he was allowed to go to the former’s camp at Wadi Ais, where I met him in April 1917. Emir Abdulla states that he had long talks with Khalid about the Akhwan sect, and towards the end of 1917—being satisfied with the latter’s professions of loyalty— obtained the reluctant consent of King Hussein to the return of Khalid to resume his duties as Emir of Khurma. 5. With reference to the Cadis of Khurma, I offer the following remarks :— After the suppression of the Wahabi revolt early in the nineteenth century, a proportion of the inhabitants of several villages, amongst them Khurma, clung to the new faith (Wahabism). The W ahabi belong to the Hambali division of the Moslem religion, and owing to the number of Wahabis in Khurma the Emirs of Mecca usually appointed a Hambali as the official cadi. Emir Abdulla informs me that the present cadi is from Wadi Dawasir, and was appointed in the ordinary course by the Emir of Mecca (King Hussein), who paid his salary and those of his assistants. It is not impossible that' the cadi also received some salary from Ibn Saud. In 1917 it was reported to King Hussein that the cadi was preaching the W^ahabi creed, &amp;c. He was ordered to Mecca, where he was given a serious lecture by King Hussein, and returned to his post at Khurma. As he still continued pyeaching^the Wahabi faith, he was sent for to Mecca a second time, and appears to h^ve satisfied King Hussein with his protestations of loyalty, &amp;c. [555 cc—1] U 1 I mHowever on returning to Khurma the second time, the cadi threw off all pretence bv openly lining the Akhwan, and his religious enthus,asm gained many adherents. An order for hi! to come to Mecca was treated with contempt ^ng Hussem there upon selected another cadi and sent him to Khurma to take over charge trom original cadi fe who ^^^^a from the Emir Abdulla's camp about the time the Cadi of Khurma had refused to obey the third summons to Mecca, theieby openly drying newly-appointed cadi, Khalid refused to allot him to take up his duties or to recognise his appointment, and openly raise Stan t1t1sT!ctrrKhdiZweT?h^ King’s summons “ part of a year (1917, ^t and virit’tbat King Hussein ascertained that Khalid had joined the Akhwan. a^ ^ Ibn gaud and ruling par t of the latter’s territory, would Ibn Saud have quietly acquiesced m an important oihcial of his eing '^iftSt^^A^aud’s and appointed by him would he have kept nuiet knowing that King Hussein had sent for the cadi and severely lectured him . q Ibn Saud has lost no opportunity of making complaints to His Majesty s Govern ment about alleged hostile actions of King Hussein, and if either of the above men was “X ah official of Ibn Sand’s, I find considerable difficulty in believing that he would allow 7 such flagrant encroachments on his sovereignty to P ass 0 “ e ' of I understand that Mr. Philby largely bases his assertion that Kliaiid is one ot Ibn Sand s governors on the statement that Khalid was in Ibn Saud before his revolt. This is by no means unlikely; indeed, it is probable that when Khalid joined the Akhwan, Ibn Saud paid him some sort of stipend for propaganda and political purposes, a financial investment which has proved highly profitab . P 10 Soon P alter Khalid raised the standard of revolt, Mr. Ph.lby passed through Khurma (December 1917), and it is interesting to note how the situation was repot e to him on the spot. In the account of his journey from Riadh to Taif (Arab bulletin No. 81, page 74, dated 9th March, 1919), Mr. Philby writes as follows:— “ Khurma is inhabited mainly by Subai tribesmen, who at the moment of our arrival were all out in the desert, leaving the village to their slaves and women, and to the Jew merchants, mainly representing- Washm, who reside here m connection with the trade Avith the interior. , , ^ . , „ • „ i “ The cause of the exodus of the tribesmen with the local Emm— a shereef—appeale to be that the latter had incurred the displeasure of the Shereef of Mecca by embracing the Wahabi faith, or perhaps had embraced the Wahabi faith because he had incurre the shereef’s displeasure, and that the Shereef of Mecca has commissioned the Emir of Turaba and the Buqum tribe to attack the rebels of Khurma as occasion ottered. “ The place was therefore virtually in a state of siege m the sense that no exit was allowed to its people in the direction of the Hedjaz, while the warriors of the Subai and Buqum were trying to out-manoeuvre each other in the vast plains between Qunsa ya and the Hadhu hills.” It will be noted that Mr. Philby writes of the “ rebels of Khurma.” Thus Khalid and those inhabitants of Khurma who revolted with him were described to Mr. f hUDy as being: rebels against King Hussein. . j Mr Philby had been living in Riadh for some time. His escort was composed o Neidis supplied by Ibn Saud, and it is probable, though I have no information on the point, that Ibn Saud sent a responsible sheikh or a member of his entourage with 1 . When passing through Khurma district Mr. Philby records the fact, on information given to him at the time, that the Emir and some of the inhabitants of Khurma ale in open rebellion against King Hussein. ... , • • , , i i&gt; It will be agreed that Khurma cannot correctly be described as being m a state ot revolt against King Hussein if it forms an integral part of Ibn Bauds dominions. Surely if Khurma belonged to Nejd some one member of the escort or some local sheikh or Arab would have informed Mr. Philby ot the fact. . . . • vj 11. As I have frequently pointed out, the Khurma episode has its origin m ia i joining the Akhwan movement and eventually openly revolting.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.1 ^ N [Ju ic 30.] r. a. .. . &gt; EO ] non 1 . i EASTERN.

E. H. H. ALLENBY. Enclosure in No. 1. A ote by Captain Garland on the Khurma Dispute. Latest Information. LAfEB reports from Jeddah have confirmed the completeness of Abdullah’s defeat at Tarabah. ^ According to a telegram sent by the King to Emir Feisal, the “martyrs” (i.e., bhereefian killed) amounted to 250, including several Ateibah Sheikhs, and also Seyyid Hilmi, who was Abdullah’s Major-General Commanding the so-called “division” of regular troops. Emirs Abdullah and Shakir were themselves slightly wounded, all guns and machine guns and two-thirds of the supplies were lost, and only one-tenth of the mule mounted infantry got away. It is worthy of note that, although they had had previous warning of the night attack, the regular officers who got away did so in their night attire. It was ever one of the Bagdadi officer s maxims not to allow military duties to interfere with his night s rest, and during the war, outposts, pickets, and the like were invariablv dispensed with by the Hedjaz armies. The 10,000 Bedouin originally reported to be with Abdullah seem to have melted away and, as Colonel Bassett remarks, “ everything points to the majority of the tribal elements which profess allegiance to King Hussein being absolutely unreliable.” A consoling feature is that the captors of the guns, See., have no followers trained in their manipulation and employment. In spite of the King’s assertion that Ibn Saud reinforced Tarabah and Khurma, with a view to attacking Abdullah, no enemy advance from Tarabah is reported. Abdullah, according to the King, is now “ remaining on the defensive,” but both he and the King fear an advance by Ibn Saud on Tail and Mecca. It is thought, however, that Ibn Saud will now rest content with his success and his reoccupation of larabah. He has common sense enough to realise that any further advance towards the Hedjaz cities would mean sacrificing our friendship, subsidy, and help, and he must realise that we possess the means to punish him even if he knows the King does not. It seems probable that His Britannic Majesty’s Government’s orders to withdraw from Tarabah will have the desired effect when he gets them. The fact that the Ikhwan have not advanced from Tarabah since they recaptured it tends to show that Ibn Saud has them under some sort of control, and if the more fanatical elements had intended to raid Taif without his authority, they would surely have moved towards it by this time. . On the arrival^ of our aeroplanes, the King will no doubt insist on immediate punitive bombing raids of Tarabah, Khurma, and other Ikhwan camps, but it appears necessary that tiie possible results of such action should be well considered before undertaking it. From every point of view it will be infinitely better if Ibn Saud can be compelled to withdraw by political pressure from Bagdad, as aeroplane bombing would increase the hatred and ill-vvill between Nejd and Mecca, would render future reconciliation more difficult, would henceforth affect the hospitality extended to British official travellers through Nejd, and might quite conceivably precipitate a wholesale conflagration, besides possibly forming matter (suitably distorted) for Indian anti- Shereefian propaganda. [2 gg- 1 ] /~1 ^ 1 (j 1 MlOne feels constrained, therefore, to suggest that the aeroplanes should be reserved entirely for defence purposes, in case of an advance by Ikhwan from their present positions And if Ibn Sand retires personally from Khurma district, it would be wisest for the Kina to refrain from occupying it until the boundary dispute is settled by our arbitration. &amp; The King will, of course, denounce this as a mere maintenance of the defensive policy which, according to his views, is at the root of the present troubl but he should realise by this time that armies incapable of carrying out success! offensives have no alternative to keeping to defensive measures. It is obvious that the settlement, by us of the boundary between Nejd and the Hedjaz is one of the Arabian affairs claiming our prompt attention, and it ought not to be much longer delayed. The military position at Khurma to-day (10th June, 1919) is as follows Ibn Baud is said to be at Tarabah, and his fotce probably amounts to 20,000 Bedouins, of which some are posted 10 miles wept of Tarabah. , 0 AAA Emir Abdullah has collected from his original force a remnant of about 3,000 Bedouins at Okheidir, 250 semi-trained regulars have left Mecca under Sagh. Kaisum to join the Emir, whilst Emir Ali at Medina is reported to be sending some machine guns and ammunition. ^ GABLAND.

I have not tresspassed over a span of his land in accordance with the treaty between the High Government and myself and that the two towns mentioned, namely Jarbah and Khurmah are considered as llejd-towns /ith muffasilats materii lly and that among other things which are laid do /n the High Government agreed to render me necessary assistance against whosoever committing trespass against my territories ana my tribesmen ana till now I am fully regarding am respecting all the terms of the treaty which was concluded between His Majesty’s Government ana myself and as soon as the oharif advanced from 'Ashirah II intimated t he same to thorn through their Political Bahrain and their Political Officers in Mesopotamia th.t if His Majesty s Ocernment no not forbid him, I shall aot he responsible n he commits an aggression; ana ewe.itea a reply to my reference for one month, out have received none up to tfclS day 6ni “ y hri’oesiaen did not commit any trespass or trans gression until after he (Sharif) had committee the same ana his actions 7ith the inhabitants of Ueja were contrary to law and reason in aemuch as bloodshed and plunder of property were committed in spite of my writings to him to withdraw to his territories when X should do the same in order to avoid any embroilment until the disputes are settled and the boundaries are fixed by arbitration through His Majesty's Government; but he never replied. On the other hand he says it -.ms not his mention in collecting these forces to advance on furbah and Xhurmah, but that he intended Al-EiadhJSl-Ahsa an, the destruc tion 01 Ai-iihawari j, meaning inhabitants of B e jd. Che proof to substantiate ny statement is in the treaties ana the letter under his signature and those of my enemies which I hola in my possession. X am complying with the message of His Majesty the King-Emperor and X have not the least intention or object in Hedjaz nor in its parts; but that the whole of my object is to ae-enu my hone ana my subjects and to protect my rights. If H,b Majesty's Government desire my withdrawal, I hope and request four Honour to give me sufficient assurance by which he (bharn) win not trespass or commit any aggression by pass in beyond the Hedjaa boundaries, namely 'Kshirah' and 'Calf' until I negotiate and communicate with my friends, the High British Government m order that facts may become known end they nay know the truthful and the liar; because I m unable to withdraw 6n ia y se±1 y owing to ITejd inhabitants having been greatly excited by his interference with their religious oe,iefs and his tres/pass against their homes. s I shall, onreceipt of a paper of assurance ordering him not to transgress tne above me n lonea. positions, which I have herein stated, from his Majesty's Government, until an inquiry is hold, withdraw, ana send oaok, the whole mobilised force, and I shall be waiting for a it-piy uo tins message, and X assure you that X have not tne least thing' which may tend to oppose the wishes of His Majesty's the iling-Emperor and His Majesty's High Government. •should His Majesty's Government consider it necessary to send an arbitration comission for the settlement of the disputes an. fixing the boundaries in a ,uitable manner, I shall be highly grateful and would request Your Honour to expedite the reply and accept my best respects. 2his is what had to be said and mly you be preserved*I-ty 1 . translation of a letter dated 28th Han&amp;zan, 1337 {a?th June lyiy) from dhai;,h dir -rvMul Asia bin Abaur Rahman A1 Faisal As baud Ruler of IIejd, to Saiyid Siddiq Ht.san Rsor., Indian Assistant, incharge Political Agency, Bahrain.

I have the honour to acimov/ledge receipt of your friendly letter comprising the message of His majesty the Ring-Emperor and have forwarded to you the reply to a message which I had the honour go receive through Kis Hajesty^ representative at Jeda&amp;h. I have jusu sent the reply 10 him. I' hope you will persue it. As regards myseli and the Bharii, according to my concluded treaties and tiie ccmmunicat ions which were addressed by me, these const!mite a strong proof for me of his aggressions against me, for which he is solely responsible and not I, having acted up to my treaty obligations. If I had ccmmitted any aggression against him contrary to the terms of the treaty and the communications, the olame would fall on me, and I would be responsible, and it is a weil-xnown fact to me that I have a right on my friends, the High Government, to punish the Sharif in accordance with the treaties. Gith regard to the disconti nuance of my subsidy, I ao not deserve to suffer this, because I have been always expecting more than that from His Majesty f s Government according to their previous promises, and I am sure, they ao not change their attitude; but if they are determined to stop it, God be praise^, it would not adversely affect my honour, nox will it affect my financial position, neither can it come in the way of my friendship with my friends, His Majesty^ Government, may their honour be preserved! This, as a matter of fact, does not much matter to me, because of my confidence in them (Government) and their promises to me. and1 A ' urisi even gi\ ing up most of my rights, in oruer to satisfy His ^ Oot ‘ JX&lt;3e H°tLt Majesty the King-^mperor, may his Honour be preserved! and also His Majesty’s High Government. Doubtless, tne trathiul will come out with his truth and the liar will be ruined with his lies. She re is no strength and no power save witl the Almighty God! I am awaiting a reply through you. I have also made a similar request to Oolonel Wilson, His Majesty’s representative at Jeudah, and I have just returned to my capital, Al-Miadh, with all my forces, and success emanates iMorn uou. is what had to be said and may you be preserved.

Ali has given me the good news of the arrival of your men at his camp and that they are on their way to us. It pleased me very much after receiving no communication from you since your departure to the North. Your men arrived at Jeddah four days ago and I understand that you did not write to me because you had sent them to Abdullah directly to lUraba. I have read your letter to Abdallah and considered it as having been written to me. I understood its contents. I!ay God, Oh my son, safeguard and protect you for ever. No doubt you wrote that letter before you had learnt about the Ateiba action against Abdulla and the capture of his position. ihis is the preordained destiny of God. Shis is the fortune of ?/ar and the like. Hay God save us all from their evils. f ihe poet says n People sometimes gain and sometimes lose”. No covering is big enough to conceal the Saud*s hatred and enmity. May God guide us all to what will lead to the welfare of the country and people. I am well aware. Oh Emir, of your qualifications and know all about you. :y sole desire, Oh my son, is that you may rest at ease and keep quietbecause verily, Oh Saud, you were, since you were manifested, (succeeded his father) Oh my little son, occupied with troublesome affairs which would make the hair of the head grey and God is with whomsoever is acting honestly. oh Kashid, everything you may think we may do for you can be done eithei /in Note.

Don't he afraid to let me know all want. Oh Saud, and may God preserve you. !*y Salaams to you and to all Jhammar who are under you. Y^rite to me everything you may see. I wish that you should inform the pilgrims of Shammar and their neighbours (the people of Iraq both Bedus and citizens) not to come here via JSejd but to come vis Hail, :edina, and Harb districts because, Oh Saud, we cannot protect our tribes from the wandering people of Hejd and its districts, (i.e. - it is not safe via islejd). 13/10/57.

The fa lowing are the points to which I wish to draw your special attention :- (1) The question is connected with the honour of my house and the traditions of my family, it is an insult which my personsil dignity cannot brook:, especially as I have uplifted my head in friendship with the British, hath u individuals, and as a noble nation. (2) The case assumes a more threatening aspect when con pared with conconitant circumstances. The danger falls primarily on Great Britain, as rmich as ourselves and no wonder that it is so. The seditious movement in Afghanis tan, i?gypt, the reotl mr, state of India, and the boiling ferment in other Asiatic countries all show that there is a properly organised plan in operation, why should not this Wahabite movement be an effective part of that plant} , or, why should it not be feared that this Wahabite moveaerst should attract the attention of tine organisers of this con spiracy, who will use it as a nest for the propagation of intrigues and a bridge from them to the sacred shrines of Islam so that the flaming result may be reached. le see the fire but the directing hand remains hidden. Prom: H.B.H. The ’'Mr Pelsol-I J {2*t+ I i#lieve that it is incumtent upon areat Britain t© cru&amp;h this ^shablts with all her power If the Western v,Qrl(? considers B&lt;&amp;shsvissi aa a social disease which endangers civiUeati on, should not the /vahat ite movement in the tear Cast be considered ae such, in so far as it is brought forward by ignorance and farm* ticisrn V (4) The Wahabite fight the ilmjas besauaa they are the friends of a non*Moslem power, and this power is Great Britain* mo notice should be taken of other excuses given by Xbn Eauci, whidh are Only intended to throw duet in the eyes of British Diplomats, His men will never under stand my other theory (vis. that the Hejas are in alliance with a non-Moslem mticn). Had It not been for that* this hatred to the Hijas would never nave arisen and tise Wmha* bites would not luive cfifiamitted themselves to the difficult task of raiding that territory, bhat will be the result if tills bad spirit floods the Arabian Peninsula ? Does not wisdom counsel 'Mir it In the bud* so that greater sacri fices may be avoided and %m world spared the task, of re moving the reaultis of poiaom :trines, by such great sacrifices. (5) that will be the moral position of Great Britain in the eyes of the Mfmlm oorlc, in general, ann in the eyes of the Arabs, in particular, if she refrains from aiding a trusty ally wiiich is known to have sxpsmiird all Its strength in fighting a common #n^y t be would never imvt done tills unless had complete confidence in Great i:ri* tain. (6) If anarchy Is allowed to reign in the Bedjas juat at a time when ail Moslftis are preparing to go on Pilgrimage, (after having been prevented trm performing their religious obligations for several years), ant especially at this juncture, when the Moslem world la disturbed at the thought of ita obscure future what will the feelings of Moslems be, especially#*p»clally when they sr? this darker attacking th# H«jaa, the heart a£ Islam ? Hoc will they regare tne Ally of the Heja* (i.e. areat Eritain) ? (7j l can see notlilng mare attractive to the leduin mind than a sviccesa, however temcorary. a man who gives him- eeli osit to be a leader in the name of religion will be a great danger both to himself and to others, if Ms first move succeeds. He will find supporters in every direction and it • ould recuire great sacrifices both of men find mor«y to cope with him. The story of the Mahdi and others like him is not far fron memory .it is for this reason that 1 have asked for immediate steps to fee taken to crush this Bolshevism in the fast. (B) slth all respect to the warning which Great Britian has expedited to Xtn Gaud, I da not believe that he sill csmpiy. if he does, the result sill only be &amp; temporary truce, it itn laud retires without force of arms being !j •W &gt; l^od against him, he will gain prestige among hie pea- I pie, who will sympathise with him for having suffered for | sal?e 0:f Islam &amp;nc there will soon rage another war, the religious flame of which will soon spread to the Eastern African coast, and I presume Great tritain desires to pre vent this contagion spreading where it will cause very sen &lt;us danger, 'mat le the reaaon why j urged that the | Wahailtiis should It Killed $ fcov^var successful other mea* | sures might prove; vi} Britain, who has sow the sssds of friendship in 4 Mecca, to win in the future the heart of Moslems, that Great Power I say, which la well-known for her foresight, will never allow ail her efforts to be made in vain, but will take every precaution to protect this plant and make it grow. Nothing will kill that plant more quickly than inactionInaction against ths Wahabit«*. The history of their first rising when they wished to win the affections of the- Moslem public, shows quite clearly that the pillage of the histori cal relics and religious treasures wag lawful and they do not hesitate to pull down places the distinction of which will lease gaping wounds in mu-y a heart, llv) 7M* success Qf the laliaMtt movement will support the moral prestige of iPirkey t because it will prove to %lm Mos lems the reality of what the Siltaas of ’iwkey alwaya pre tended, *Um% they are the protect ore of the Holy Places which would have hem pillaged had it not been for their help*. 1 do not think that great Britain would allow such a false pretension to materialist or the Turks or their followers to exult over the British and ourselves. (11) I want the Wmhafcibts to he crushed by the sword and m% ty * tnreots for the reason above mentioned m well as for the preservation of our prestige. I do not wish the name of my father to be dishonaired in his last days, which ought to be days of honoured ease, after the hardship which he hag endured. This would lessen the prestige of our family in the eyes of the Beduin especially, among whan our mr&amp;l pasm on shsuld fet prt served, if it is dssirta ta hold open the doors of the Holy Places. (12) l.'remcenter my father declaring to his intimates that Great Britain had, at the beginning of the rising, contract ed to help him to crueh %hy interior revolt v-hich ?aight en danger his position ant I hope that this is the hour to put this into execution. (13) If the Arabic proverb is true *The owner of the house knows best what’s in it*, may X be allowed to say that the oriental spirit is only understood by an oriental am no one else. The decision of others, however astute they may be in discovering the secret stf any problems, may sometime® bt a long way from understanding this oriental spirit, because the%h * spirit iB ml ? knawn t,© Its ©irmr arid I thtrtfort beg to r®p«at timt tli© «alial4t© movement ia a danger both now iaid in the future and should be rooted out at once. 1 hat * religion being mud* an instrument tor pen cnml aggrteidiseaent an the wabnUteB ary doing at pre sent* X hot* th*!?!, because X believe they are a danger to themeelves, to their neighbours in Arabia &amp;nc in other countries. (15) The last low years of wahabite history ( »e must always fdllfflr this guide) givee uk an indication of tiie evil consequenceB of their occupation of Khermah and teach us wiat they mean by entering by that doorway, whenever they meant mischief against the Hajaa, their AUies or the Moslems in general. (16) The contact of the fiejas with the /Jilieb and especially Ritfi ureut irituin liau led to the acceptance of .ur spestfi civilised principlea, and it is therefore essential that 1 ■ edjftz should bn assisted to upholc such prihclulea, in thut they may be disseminated sraang the tribes, wliich have been left neglected under toe influence of Barbarism, jje- olsct of the Hedjaz soder present circumstaoeos would mm the defeat of civilisation at toe hands of barbarism, to® cannot therefore put aside tae idea of helping the iiedjas, if It is really desired that Islam should begin a new era, iren from fanaticism and fully t(Iterant, to spread from iSecca to distant provinces as of old. The power which will huvr the greatest credit in the fulfilment of this scheme will be Great Britain and I very much doubt if she will al low the destruction of the hailding which she is now erect ing ano the leaving of the Hejaz at the crossways. (17) There is another moral obligation, not less than the first.iirt't, of ciiich vour :xcpll®nBjr &amp;s aware, itn amid has re- frained from aiy aetlon during the Bar, although Great Bri tain has tried to perauade Mm to ootabllBh his political status in the world by taking up arms against our cannon er.ffiisy.

(IS) ,;,jy friendship for Great Britain, ny recognition of ay gratitude to her, isy belief that it is to her interest ae well as that of Islam to fortify such friendship and purify l it frsra any nUsundersUnding, all this has induced me to give open expression to ^y opinions and open avowal of my cane - for other.-isr I should he acting against the prineiplei of the engagements I have made with her.

He told out man to go and tell Ibn Saud that they have not come with the army to take Khurma and Tarbua only but Hejd and its people also. And he sent his men to fight with ours at a place between Khurma and Taruba. was leading his amazi men who liad guns and machines. His army consisted of 3000 Turkish Soldiers, 7000 Hedjaz followers, guns, machines and other war material which were not counted. He had stores and materials which were not less than 10,000 camel loads. When our men saw this, they attacked the Sheriff and opened fire in the name of God and by God’s help defeated him with his army and surrounded hid troops and all war materials. So far as is known the Sheriff escaped to Taif with only 200 camels and 50 horsemen.

Then 2,000 of them marched out to avenge and of these 500 were swordmen carrying no other arms. The Sharif had 4,000 Turkish troops taken from liedinah, 7,000 Ei^azi troops with 20 guns, 40 machine-guns and large stores carried by nearly 10,000 camels. He had fortified Tarabah after occupying it and also made a trench around it. The Ikhv/an attacked before dawn while it was still dark. The Sharif was fore-warned and the fight lasted the whole day; Sharif Abdullah himself slipped out at the commencement with 50 horsemen and EGO camel-riders; but his men fought on and were nearly all killed and everything belonging to them taken.

According to a telegram sent by the King to Amir Lei sal, the 'martyrs” (i.e. Sl^eriiian killed) amounted to L50, including several Ateibah Sheikhs and also Seyyid Eilmi, who was Abdullah’s Major General Commanding the so-called 'Division' of regular troops* Biairs Abdullah and Shakir were themselves slightly wounded; all guns end machine guns and two thirds of the supplies were lost; and Oiily one tenth of the Mule kounte Infantry got away.

It is thought, however, that Ibn 3 ud v/ill now rest content with his success and his reoccupation of larabah. He has comraon-seiise enough to realise that any further advance towards the Hejaz Cities would mean sacrificing our friendship, subsidy and help, and he must realize that we possess the means to punish him even if he loiows the King does not. It seems probable that H.3L. Government's orders to withdraw from Tarabah will have the desired effect when he gets them. -he fact that the Ihkwan have not advanced from faraLrh since they recaptured it, tends to show that Ibn Saud has them under some sort of control and if the more fanatical elements had intended to raid Taif without his authority they would surely have moved towards it by this On the arrival of our aeroplanes, the King will no doubt insist on immediate punitive bombing raids on &amp; Tarabah, Khurma and other Ikhwan camps, but it appe rs necessary that the possible results of such action whould well considered before undertaking it. From every point of view it will be infinitely better if Ibn Baud can be compelled to withdraw by political pressure from Baghdad, as aeroplane bombing would render future reconciliation more difficult, would henceforth affect the hospitality extended to British Official travellers through Kejd; and might conceivably precipitate a wholesale conflagration, besides/forming matter (suitably distorted) for Indian anti-Bherifian propaganda# One feels constrained, therefore, to su* . est that the aeroplanes should be reserved entirely for defence \ time possiblymm iaf ’f f. • 1 ' J? \ |:* , -f ■ \ il-' lb * w ,.. 1 S •% L | eience purposes, in case ol an advance by Ikiiwan from tueir ^-sent poaitions.

Your telegrams Nos. 971, 978 and connected correspondence have been very carefully considered by Kis Majesty's Governnent. We agree that of two alternatives set out in your telegram No. 971 lfo.(l) is impracticable and that only alternative is to endeavour to settle dispute by negotiation as you propose; We have not received Wilson's Kb;W.610 of 11th June and are therefore not quite clear as to oxact nature of discussion contemplated at proposed meeting, but we presume from factthat British officers are to take part that something in nature of British arbitration is coiv- temulated. There seems little livelihood of obtaining satisfactory settlement by ary other means; It appears to H.H.G that essential preliminary to arbitration or indeed discussion of ary kind must be suspension of hostilities and if this object is to be attained first step seems to be not to summon meeting of both parties but to send Agent to Biat Saud to induce him to stop advance pendir^ arbitration: see first part of third paragraph of your telegram No. 978.

In view of difficulty of communicating with Baghdad he will h e placed under your orders during period of mission. He will proceed to Cairo by air with least possible delay and place himself at your disposal. You will doubtless make most expeditious arrangements possible for his onward journey and will consult us at each stage. You should take immediate steps to inform Bin Saud of Philby's approaching visit.

The Chairman said that since the last meeting Ibn Sand’s reply to the message which had reached him through Abdulla had been received. It was unexpectedly conciliatory in tone, and in it he again expressed his readiness to submit to arbitration. Colonel Wilson at Jeddah and General Allenhy had suggested that a meeting should be arranged, at some point east of Taif, between Ibn Sand and Abdulla, in the presence of British officers associated with the views of either side, and the Government of India had expressed the earnest hope that negotiations on these lines would be effected. The points to be decided were : Firstly, whether the proposed meeting should be approved ; secondly, behind what lines the combatants should be directed to withdraw their forces during the meeting ; and thirdly, if there was to be a meeting, who should attend it ? Mr. Shuckburgh read a telegram which had just been received from Colonel A. T. Wilson at Baghdad, in which he pointed out that he was not personally acquainted with Ibn Saud, and suggested that instead of his attending the proposed meeting himself, Mr. Philby should be deputed to represent him. Mr. Philby, replying to a question by the Chairman, said he was doubtful whether the policy of the meeting was a right one, but this question depended upon the action which it was considered desirable that Ibn Saud should take. If he was merely to be induced to withdraw from his present front line pending arbitration, he con sidered that this end would be more easily achieved if he were [987]—745~ } ' i i , I* 2 himself—with King Hussein’s concurrence—to visit Ibn Saud and lay before him the views of His Majesty’s Government. He feared that a meeting at which both chieftains would certainly be accom panied by a large armed force would only result in further bloodshed. He had always considered that Ibn Saud had a very good claim to Khurma, but none to Tarabah, which was undoubtedly within thp * Hejaz frontier. The real boundary should, in his opinion, run fro. Hanakir through Maran. and should pass 10 miles west of Khurma. If it was understood that Ibn Saud should now be induced to with draw behind this proposed frontier, the only place he would have to evacuate would be Tarabah. He considered that it was urgent that some steps should be taken without delay if the position was not to develop to such an extent that military intervention on our part would become necessary. He did not think that it would take him more than a week to get to Jeddah if arrangements could be made for him to proceed by air. He was not personally very friendly with Hussein, who had resented his original journey past Tail to Jeddah, and had suggested that he should return through Nejd instead. Mr. Montagu thought that the proposal that Ibn Saud should only be made to withdraw from Tarabah, and that he should be left in occupation of Khurma, amounted in effect to acknowledging a claim which His Majesty’s Government had hitherto not accepted—- that the possession of Khurma was a debatable point. He doubted whether Hussein would allow Mr. Philby to be sent to Ibn Saud with such a message as that proposed. He considered that it was Hussein who should be approached rather than Ibn Saud, as it was on Hussein’s part that concessions were demanded. The Chairman pointed out that the proposal was only intended to make Ibn Saud hold his hand until the arrival of a boundary Commission. He did not deny that the policy which was now being discussed amounted to a reversal, of that hitherto adopted, but in view of Ibn Saud’s strong position he did not see how it was possible to adhere to the latter. He was quite prepared to consider any suggestion on the original lines, but it must be remembered that if Ibn Sand were to consider himself provoked in any way he would continue his operations and attack and seize the Holy Places. Mr. Montagu did not see how King Hussein could be expected to accept arbitration so long as Ibn Saud was actually in possession of the disputed ground. The Chairman agreed that Hussein had always been against arbitration, but he did not think, in view of his dangerous position, that it would be very difficult to make him change his point of view. In reply to a suggestion by Miss Bell, that Hussein would possibly abdicate again, he confessed that he contemplated his complete disappearance, not only without apprehension, but even with satisfaction. General Badcliffe thought that Hussein must be badly frightened; if he were confronted with the choice of being over run by his enemy and giving safe-conduct to Mr. Philby, he thought that there was little doubt that he would accept the latter alternative. Mr. Philby, replying to questions by the Chairman, said that adjudication of the boundary on the lines of tribal occupation would not be difficult, but the real point was which suzerainty the tribes concerned would accept. There was no question in his mind which tribe ought to be in occupation of Tarabah, for example, but it was quite possible that if this tribe turned Wahabi and joined the Akhwan movement it would elect for the suzerainty of Ibn Saud rather than that of Hussein. He considered that the Commission might suitably be despatched in September, and that it should3 I bn Rashid. consider the whole frontier from Hanakir down to Raina. It should be clearly understood that if Ibn Saud was to be induced to with draw his forces from Tarabah, Hussein should not be allowed to occupy the village during the armistice. Captain Aylmer asked that the Rear-Admiral in the Red Sea should be given discretion to take such necessary steps as deflecting merchant shipping into Jeddah on the demand of the British agent. He said that the Admiralty were anxious that this authority should be given in view of the outcry which would almost certainly be raised in the press and by Chambers of Commerce at what would be described as an unwarrantable interfence with trade. The Chairman agreed that this authority should be given, though* he sincerely hoped that matters would not come to such a head that it would be necessary to evacuate British subjects from Jeddah. He said that if it were decided to despatch Mr. Philby to Ibn Saud he should go to Cairo en route, and be placed temporarily under General AUenby’s orders for the purpose of his mission. He must also see Colonel Wilson at Jeddah, and the latter should, in the meantime, be instructed through General Allenby to endeavour to obtain Hussein s concurrence to the course proposed. He did not think that we could accept Ibn Saud’s fresh claim that Tarabah was also in dispute, and he thought that every effort should be made to induce Ibn Saud to withdraw to Khurma. The Conference decided — 1. that the foreign Office should telegraph to General Allenby, informing him of the decisions arrived at and instructing him to take steps to convey them to Hussein and Ibn Saud. 2. That the India Office should repeat this telegram to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, and inform him that it had been decided that Mr. Philby should be placed temporarily under General Allenby’s orders for the purposes of his mission. 3. That the Rear-Admiral, Red Sea, should be authorised to use his discretion on the steps to be taken at the request of the British agent at Jeddah if it became necessary to contemplate evacuation. 2. The Conference had before them telegram No. 15552 of the G th May, 1919, from the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. Sir Arthur Hirtzel said that it was necessary to give the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, some instructions regarding Ibn Rashid, who had made overtures to His Majesty’s Government and was waiting in the desert outside Basra for a reply. Colonel A. T. Wilson had made certain proposals in his telegram No. 15552 of the 17th May, but the India Office, in a letter to the Foreign Office of the 31st May, had held that, so far as Mesopotamia was concerned, there was no reason for entering into any relations with Ibn Rashid at all, and that in any case such relations should be conducted from Cairo. Sir A. Hirtzel questioned these views for four reasons: (1) Ibn Rashid was our neighbour, and if our frontier was to be respected, it was practically impossible not to have relations with him and other desert chiefs similarly situated; (2) Ibn Rashid controlled the pilgrim routes from Mesopotamia, and it was of considerable local importance that they should be kept open; (3) if French influence extended through the Syrian tribes down to Jauf, we should require Ibn Rashid’s goodwill to oppose a barrier to its further extension ; (4) Ibn Rashid’s relations had, in fact, for economic and other reasons, always been with Baghdad and not Damascus.4 1 He therefore suggested that, without abandoning our policy of abstaining irom interference in Central Arabian politics, we should subsidise Ibn Rashid as long as he kept the pilgrim routes open and respected our frontier, and that this should be done from Baghdad. The Chairman thought that the figure suggested bv Colon ’ ' Wilson was excessive, and asked what Ibn Rashid uas likely i spend it on. Miss Bell said that it would probably be spent on the entertain ment of guests. She agreed that the figure appeared excessive m view of the fact that 'it was to be a Peace and not a War subsidy. It was clearly impossible that Ibn Bashid s advances should be altogether ignored ; he had always had relations with Baghdad, and was an important factor from the Mesopotamian point of view. She did not know what subsidy the Turks used to pay him before the war, but she thought 1,000Z. or possibly even 5007, per month would be sufficient as a quid pro quo for his keeping the pilgrim route. The Chairman considered that for the reasons given by Sir Arthur Hirtzel it was desirable for His Majesty’s Government to approve in principle that Ibn Bashid should be subsidised, but he thought that steps should be taken to ascertain what payments were made to him by the Turks before the war. The Conference decided — That the India Office should telegraph in this sense to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. (Initialled) C. of K. Foreign Office, June 17, 1019. m l.

A Telegram from Political, Baghdad, to the Secretary of State 6714. Secret#/, Your telegramyof 13th June. In our anxiety to support King Husain, other aspects t of the question should not be overlooked. he has long been regarded by important sections of Mohamedan thought, viz., as a puppet dependent on British gold for support and (? devoid of) real influence other than that bought with British gold. Ibn Saud on the other hand owes his strong position alike to his race his religion his geographical situation and his personality; he does not depend upon r^a.1 and I submit we should be careful not to be driven prematurely into an attitude of hostility to him and his adherents: in this connection it may be considered desirable to depute Mr Philby to proceed to his camp and to enter into direct negotiations with him. If properly handled I am convinced that xk will not advance on Mecca and I believe he could be induced to refrain from occupying Taif. (?The) despatch of Indian Mahomedan or other troops would be misunderstood would arouse the Akhwan fanaticism probably causing widespread resentment elsewhere. I think that it should be avoided at all costs. On the other hand it is important that it should be made clear that Ibn Saud has not acted at our xk instigation. Reports from Political Officers indicate that whilst there is some anxiety lest Mecca should fall into the hands of the Akhwan there is little or no active sympathy with King Husain and no resentment against Ibn Saud. Opinion an for India. Dated 14th. June 1919. show,* him much in same light as that in which he—r- / ( 2 ) p Persia and India as far as I am aware of it on the whole is hostile to King Husain owing to his attitude in the matter of Turkish Caliphate and in these countries and even in Mesopotamia his present difficulties will be regarded as punishment for his apostacy. The abdication of King Husain would in the long run probably be the best thing that could happen; it would make it easy for Ibn Saud to withdraw and it would make an adjustment of difference^Obetween Nejd and Hedjaz possible for it is mainly assumption by Husain of his title that has brought about the present situation. The Arab movement is becoming steadily more anti-foreign and anti^British. It shows however no sigi of being constructive nor does it promise to develop on peaceful lines* Arabia never has and never can be united and the present movement is a natural reaction against^s^\Arab idea* The abdication of King Husain should go far to hasten collapse of Arab movement in its present form and will thus facilitate a settlement of the questions in Mesopotamia Syria and Palestine on lines acceptable alike to the Allies and to the mass of the local population(s) in those places.

[987]—727 The Chairman said that at the last meeting it had been decided e m e y to warn Ibn Saud that we were on King Hussein’s side, e^was told that unless he immediately withdrew his forces from the -i ?. , Iui ma area, he would be regarded as having adopted an attitude of definite hostility towards His Majesty’s Government, and that m that event the rest of his subsidy would at once be dis continued, and he would forfeit all advantages secured under the ieaL} o ecember, 1915. This message could not have reached ^ . ai i c /lcl d § J lc l a,( l’ a co I j y ^ appeared to have been sent , to him from the Red Sea side, and to have been delivered to him actuaily on the field of battle. The military position, when it was decided to send this message, had been that Abdulla was apparently m the superior position, and the main object had been to prevent the spread of hostilities. But since then the military balance had swung round, and Abdulla had sustained a disastrous defeat. The latest reports indicated that Ibn Saud was in occupation of Tarabah, and that Taif was seriously threatened. An ominous feature was Lolonel Wilson s report, that Hussein and Abdulla appeared to have lost all influence with the troops. Since the last meeting a suggestion had been made by the Foreign Office to General Allenby that 1 eisal should be sounded on the desirability of goino- i n person to his father s assistance, but General Allenby had not considered it advisable to act in this sense. He had, 'however, agreed that Oolonei Lawrence would be more usefully employed in the Heiaz than m Syria. It was not known exactly where Colonel Lawrence was ; he had apparently landed in Crete with the intention of visiting Knossos, and he was to have proceeded by aeroplane, leaving Rome on the 5th or 6th June. He was now presumably in Egypt,2 if not actually on his way to the Hejaz. A flight of aeroplanes had been sent by General Allenby to Hussein’s assistance, subject to a protest from the Government of India, but his original intention to despatch a company of Indian IMahommedans as escort had been vetoed on the representation of the Secretary of State for India. There appeared to be some fear that the French would offer to send Mahommedan troops, and General Allenby had _ been instructed to deprecate the use of French troops to the exclusion of our own, and to endeavour to ensure French participation being confined to co-operation on an iusignificant scale, if and when it was decided that British troops should be sent. Hussein himself was apparently content with the moral prestige of aeroplane support. He had replied to a proposal from Feisal to call upon the Allies for Mahommedan troops by warning him not to ask for any French or other forces. He had expressed the opinion that if neither the aeroplanes nor the message to Ibn Sand had the desired effect, it would be preferable for him to resign. Last came the critical question—on which a decision had to be reached without delay—of the steps which should be taken in the event of a stream of fugitives pouring down to Jeddah and claiming British protection. The Conference 'had to decide whether His Majesty’s Government should take the unprecedented step of defending Jeddah, and, if not, whether they should arrange for the evacuation of fugitives, and how this could be done. He was himself inclined to the opinion, which was, however, prompted by instinct rather than by reason, that Ibn Saud would hold his hand when he realised that we were determined to maintain our policy of supporting Hussein against him. Miss Bell feared that we could not reckon on this. Ibn Saud was not a great tribal chieftain like Ibn Rashid. He had been trying for some time to hold out against the Akhwan movement and to restrain his fanatical adherents, but they had apparently collected in unexpectedly large numbers, and she was doubtful whether Ibn Saud could control them now even if he wished to. Abdulla’s force must have been exceedingly badly handled for the Wahabis to have defeated it as they had, and the effect on them of their victory would almost certainly be that the last vestige of any control which Ibn Saud had exercised over them would vanish. Replying to questions by the Chairman, Miss Bell said that, without actually differing from the policy which had been adopted, she was inclined to think that the measures taken to carry it out had not been quite fair to Ibn Saud. She realised that he had put His Majesty’s Government in the position of having to decide a vexed question without an opportunity of investigating it thoroughly, but she doubted whether it had been made sufficiently clear to him that he would so completely lose our support if he persisted in enforcing his claims. Whether intentionally or not, we had en couraged him to think that he would be given a position equal to that of King Hussein. The actual aggression at Khurma she did not think he could have stopped in any case. As regards the steps to be taken now to support Hussein she did not feel competent to advise. Mr. Montagu explained that his reason for deprecating the em ployment of Indian Mahommedan troops was the fear of unpleasant incidents, or even mutiny, amongst the Mahommedans of the Indian Army when they heard that Indian troops were being sent to support a Mahommedan chief who had rebelled against the Caliph. He understood the view of the Indian Moslems to be that Hussein owed his position as guardian of the Holy Places to the Sultan of Turkey, who in his capacity as Caliph had recognised and subsidised him. They would say that he had been bought over by us to be a traitor to his master, and the despatching of Indian Mahommedan troops to his assistance would be putting an unfair strain on Mahommedan elements in the Indian army.3 Inijfi aensfqoii .a o.) ioBjd im oi nortnatoi naad hiul li- .nil ‘ft 1 to! '•i The Chairman pointed out that he could have understood this line being taken by the Indian Moslems if it were a question of supporting Hussein against the Caliph, but he was inclined to think that if the Moslems of India were appealed to to protect the Holy Places from a fanatical horde of Wahabis, who might be expected to cause serious damage in the Sacred Cities, they would fly to the rescue. Mr. Shuckburgh observed that to the Moslem agitator any stick was good enough to beat the Government with. However illogical their attitude might be the effect of their appeals would have to be reckoned with. . Major Young^ replying to a question by the Chairman, said that the detachment of Indian Mahommedans who had volunteered for service with the Sherif Feisal, had done excellent work even when actually fighting against the Sultan s / troops, and had unanimously volunteered to return to Feisal’s army on the expiration of their leave to India. Any disaffection among Indian Moslem troops in Mesopotamia had been prompted by reluctance to participate in operations against the Guardian Power of the Shiah Holy Places, and did not, he thought, offer an analogy to any proposal to protect the Holy Places of the Hejaz. At the same time he was strongly opposed to the despatch of troops to the Hejaz at all, if it could be avoided, and thought that any action m this sense should be confined to covering Jeddah if it became necessary to evacuate British subjects. The Chairman, replying to a suggestion by Mr. Shuckburgh, said that when it had been proposed to send Soudanese troops to Habegh, the idea had not been accepted with alacrity. He thought, however, that the General Officer Commanding Egypt Force might be asked by telegraph what troops would be available in the event of Colonel Wilsons apprehensions being justified and the Wahabis advancing on Jeddah. It was possible that events might move very rapidly, and he did not think that we ought to wait until the fatal event happened before taking any steps. As far as he remembered we used to have a hen on available shipping in Egyptian waters in the earlier days of the war, and he thought that the Ministry of Shipping should be asked what shipping would be available to proceed to Jeddah at short notice. Captain Aylmer said that the Admiralty had telegraphed that day to the Admiral, who was now at sea on his way from Kamaran to Suez. He had been instructed to report on the situation at Jeddah. B-sides the Admiral’s sloop, and H.M.S. “Clio” at Port Soudan, there was a light cruiser at Hodeidah. Mr. Montagu pointed out that Colonel Wilson at Jeddah was apparently in communication with H.M.S. “ Clio.” He mentioned that he had already asked the Government of India their views on the question generally, but he agreed with the Chairman that a further enquiry might be made as to the steps to be taken in the event of the general exodus to Jeddah, feared by Colonel Wilson. He proposed, in addition, to obtain the views of the Indian Mahommedan member of the India Council. Miss Bell, replying to a question by Mr. Montagu, said that she did not think any good could be done by attacking Ibn Saud from the Persian Gulf side ; it was clearly out of the question for troops to invade his territory, and there was nothing on the coast of Hasa which could be usefully bombarded. General Radcliffe said that the War Office would find great difficulty in providing troops for the Hejaz. It was possible that General Allenby might be able to send a battalion from Syria, which could be replaced from among the troops which were being j A ■ Iff Aevacuated from the Caucasus, but this would take a long time. He reminded the Conference that any appealance on our part of withholding the support asked for by King Hussein might antagonise Feisal, and increase our difficulties in Syria. He mentioned that aeroplanes had been of great effect at Nejef, even though no bombs had actually been dropped, and he urged strongly that the co-operation of the flight which had been sent to Jeddah at Hussein’s request should not be withheld in deference to the views of the Government of India. Miss Bell, replying to a question by the Chairman, said that it was difficult to say what would be the effect in Mesopotamia of a complete defeat of Hussein and Abaulla by Ibn Saud, and a Wkhabi occupation of the Holy Cities ; the inhabitants of Koweit and Zobeir, who lived on the fringe ot the Nejd and had been in contact with the Wahabis, cordially disliked them, and their views would probably be reflected in other parts of Mesopotamia. It should be remembered that to the Wahabis Medina was not a Holy City, and the Sunnis of Iraq would certainly be unfavourably affected if the pilgrimage to Mecca were restrained by Wahabis from proceeding to Medina. The Chairman said it appeared that Ibn Saud had lost control of his own men and that no further steps on our part, whether from the lied Sea or the Persian Gulf side, were likely to have any effect in restraining the Wahabis. We were expecting Ibn Sauds reply to our message in the course of a day or two, and beyond finding out from the various authorities concerned what action was considered practicable or desirable in the event of a Wahabi advance on Jeddah, he did not think that anything could usefully be done. King Hussein had never been diffident about asking for assistance, and he thought that we should wait for an appeal from him before considering either further financial assistance or the replacement of the guns which had been lost by Abdulla. The Conference decided — (1.) That the Foreign Office should ascertain from the Ministry of Shipping what, prospect there was of evacuating refugees from Jeddah : (2.) That the War Office should ask the General Officer Com manding Egypt Force what Mahommedan troops, whether Soudanese or Indian, would be available for covering a possible withdrawal at short notice : (3.) That the Secretary of State for India should consult the Mahommedan member of the India Council and the Government of India on the probable attitude of the Indian Mahommednns in the event of an appeal being made to them by King Hussein to co-operate in the defence of the Holy Places against the Wahabis.

If ha makes no advance during this time, the wisest course would probably be for aeroplanes (if sent) net to risk aggravation of the situation by bombing his camps, but reconnoitre (?the latter) and in the event of enemy advance to be available. I consider it imperative that aeroplanes should be sent c!nnot e v r ??

In the meantime we can only await result of His Majesty’s Government’s orders to Bin Baud and without delayplanes landed here. Addressed to Foreign Office Ho, 950. Repeated to Ir^i\.

Both King and Abdulla urge immediate despatch of aeroplanes to bomb Khurma, Taraba and Akhwan camps. They say this will probably stop advance and cause tribes ? now hesitating, to join King.
