Miller outlines changes he introduced including structural reorganization (with Divisions for English, Arabic, Computer, Business, and other studies), unified curriculum, and new financial controls.  He describes CACE instructors and students, and covers its accreditation, branches throughout Egypt and overseas, new initiatives like summer programs and e-learning, and the major USAID English Language Testing and Training program. The role and reputation of CACE and other continuing education units at the university are discussed, as are the impact of presidential leadership, financial challenges, and aspects of AUC administrative and workplace culture. Miller offers comparisons between continuing education at AUC and in Egypt and at his previous workplaces in the U.S., and speaks of the potential impact of the new campus under-construction.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
