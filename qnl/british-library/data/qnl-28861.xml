We will at once let you know as soon ag we hear the Sheikh’s reply.

The list, with the papers in original, was given to Colonel Fowle, who discussed it with Lr.Rogers, and as a result thought that the choice lay between Dr. Blackrran of Oxford and Colonel Gordon-Brown. He and I accordingly interviewed these two gentlemen last week and obtained particulars from them of the nature of their establishment ana the terms on which they would be prepared to accept the Sheikh’s son. 2. Colonel Fowle was definitely of opinion that Dr. Blackman was the more satisfactory c£ the two. He took a note of his qualifications and terms and will discuss the matter further with the Sheikh on his forthcoming visit to Koweit ana let us know the result. No final decision as between the two possible tutors was, however, taken, pending the result of this discussion, ana if the Sheikh agrees that Dr. Blackman may be accepted, it will be necessary when the time comes to let Colonel Gordon Brown know. I promised to arrange for this. 3. No further action is necessary for the moment. On the question of Lr. Rogers’ fees it is relevant that Dr. Blackrran mentioned that he would have to pay Messrs.

Dear Laithwaite, Thank you for your letter of the 31st march and for sending me copies of letters from Father Ronald Knox and Greswell, together with a copy of a letter to Walton from the Political Resident in tne Persian Gulf. I am now going to give the matter very careful consideration and will write to you again in a few days’ time to put one or two definite proposals in front of you. In regard to the questions raised in the Political Resident’s letter, I think the Sheikh of Koweit must be prepared to pay between £300 and £400 a year by way of fees to the tutor. This should include total expenses throughout the year, apart from a personal allowance. I do not think this latter item should amount to very much especially if the young man arrives with a proper outfit of clothes. 4s to the amount of allowance, I think it would be best to be guided eventually by the tutor on whom your choice falls. I do not think it matters very much when the Sheikh’s son joins the tutor. It would be preferable for him to arrive at the begin ning of the term and probably the September term would be the most convenient. This note is merely by way of acknowledgment. I will write to you again fully in a few days’ time. I hope that when the Political Resident arrives in London towards the end of the month you and he will come round and see me and we can talk the matter over in detail.

Rogers, You were so kind, when Walton and 1 discussed with you the other day the question of the arrangements for the education in this country of the eldest son of the sheikh of Koweit in the Persian Gulf, as to offer to help us with your advice if we would let you have further particulars about the son anu the nature of the educational facilities which we were anxious to secure for him. I enclose copy of a letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to Walton, which, I think, gives the information in question. As was explained when we talked the matter over, enquiries maoe last summer of the Oxford Appointments Committee on behalf of the Sheikh, before the matter was put on an official basis, resulted in their recommending, in addition to a private tutor, Mr. Goldring’s establishment at Begbroke Place. While the tutor in question would no doubt be an admirable man to prepare the Sheikh's son, I rather doubt if he is quite what is wanted, and the authorities/I It authorities in the Gulf are clearly more in favour of an establishment rather of the nature of Golaring's. But the confidential enquiries we have made about Goldring, copies of the replies to which I enclose, ao not seem to us to be quite aecisive in his favour ana that the fact that he is about to change house is possibly a further complication. We should greatly appreciate any help or aavice you coula give us both on the question generally and in particular on the specific points raised by tne Political Pesiaent in his letter to Walton. The Resident will, we hope, be here for a short visit towarasthe end of April and th most satisfactory course would perhaps be, if you could then spare the time, that we snould have a mooting[ ana j discuss the matter in more detail. Your firm might conceivably be in a position by then to let us have either an opinion on the general suitability of hr. Goldring's establishment, or suggestions as to a more satisfactory alternative. J. G. LAITHWA1TE.r ^ &lt;yJCC 3 March 14. Dear Laithwaite, ^ Thank you for your litterQi» whether what you want is t white Zl • Th Old Palace, Oxford. ?(&gt;* quite sure from it who will devote all his attention to a single pupil. T douWif Goldring would he well advised to accept such a post as that, because he has a connexion with some half-dozen boys whom he tutors, or causes to be tutored, in his own house, and it would obviously be a pity to give bnat S up for a single pir which might come to an end after a year, lea ving him high and dry. If the Sheikhlet is prepared to form part of a tutoring establishment, then it is a different matter. Gold ring has already got a Siamese with him, who seetes to get on quite happily, though he is 21 and most of the people who are tutored by X Goldring are mere boys. A reference to Evelyn Cardew, whom you probably know, might give you some idea whether the arrangement has been a success or not. The bother is that G. is just having to move from Begbroke Place, a very nice house where he has been carrying on so far, because the lease is up. His intention is to move into a house^u North Oxford; I think it is called the Old Parsonage, Summer^own not of course the one next St Giles’; I am told ife is a nice house with a good garden, but I do not know it. And then of couree being in Oxford, instead of several miles out, will make the dis cipline of the show a more complicated business. So all I can say. really is that Goldring is a pleasant man, and that boys seem hap^y there. If you think it worth fAllowing up, I think you will have to write to Goldring direct about the new residence, because I have no particulars of it, and am just off for my holiday. I wish you ever came down here.

Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.1. CONFIDENTIAL. Dear Sir , Deference your confidential letter No. P.Z.868/59 dated 11th March 1953&gt; regarding the sone of the Sheikh of Koweit. I have met Major Frank Holmes, and also know well Mr. Gold ring of Begbroke Place wnom I recommended to Major Holmes. Mr. Goldring is a man of about 50 years of age who retired some three years ago from an educational post in South Africa, and took on the Begbroke Place coaching establishment. He tooK his degree from Exeter College. He is married, his wife being not strong but not an invalid, and he is assisted so far as household matters are concerned by a daughter of about 25 , who strikes me as a particularly sensible and able young woman. Mr. Goldring is socially quite suitable to undertake the work and though, being a comparative stranger in the locality, he cannot offer his pupils many outside social aruenities (the value of which would be in any case doubtful); I am of opinion that so far as social training is concerned the provision would be perfectly adequate.

The son is about 25 years old. His present standard of education is that he can read and write a little English, and the local political authorities ana his father are apparently anxious that ne shoula be given a good general education which wou^d fit him to act as a sort of confidential secretary to his father. Koweit, though a small state, has many contacts with the outsiae world ana it would be !of distinct advantage for the ruler to have such an assistant. If arrangements could be made, the would probably come here for, say, a year in the first instance, at the ena of which the Sheikh, in the light of reports of how he was shaping, might aeciae whether he should continue his education or return to Koweit. tly excuse for bothering you is that the Oxford Appointments Board some time ago put up the names of 1 (Hi,'} 4000 7.32 possible/possible tutors, one of whom is Lr. Golaring, of Beghroke Place, who, in a recent letter, mentioned that you knew him and would, he thought, answer any questions about him. I shall be most grateful if you would let us know your opinion, which we woula, of course, treat as confidential, of his general suitability.

Dear Mr. Laithwaite, I was asked by H.E. the Sheikh of Kuwait to arrange for his son, Mohammed, to be tutored in England, preferably in Oxford. The Sheikh of Kuwait was anxious that his son should have special treatment from a tutoring point of view and be forced along as rapidly as possible with his studies. Before seeing you I had been in communication with Mr. Greswell, the Secretary of the Oxford University Appointment Committee. He had recommended Mr. George, who at present is attached to the Foreign Office, room 48 or 46 (l am not sure which) and Mr. Goldring of Begbroke Place near Oxford. The latter seemed especially suitable and is strongly recommenced by ' r. Greswell. I tell you of these two in hopes that you may be inclined to engage one of them. It may be that when you are making your choice I could give details to the applicants of the ideas of the Sheikh concerning his son. If you think so I will be ready to come at any time to meet the applicants.K.G.Laithwaite Esq. ^rd August, 19^2. It is a relief for me to be free from the responsibility of making the choice. The India Office will give such a strong background to the whole affair and Mr. Greswell expressed his satisfaction that such an arrangement was to be made. I shall write to H.E. the Sheikh of Kuwait and let him know of the new plans about his son. If you should wish to see me regarding the subject matter of this letter I can come along any time suitable to you. My telephone is Mansion House 865 ^. Yours sincerely.Major Holmes of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, etc. called to see me this morning, with particular reference to arrangements for the tutoring of one of the sons of the Sheikh of Koweit. He also discussed a variety of points connected with Bahrein and Koweit oil. As regards the first of these questions, Major Holmes said that the elder son of the Sheikh of Koweit, Muhanmad, was now about 33 and had been for some time undergoing training at the American University at Beirut. He was a stupid boy and had not made much progress at Beirut, where he was inclined to waste his time. The Sheikh was very anxious that a tutor should be provided for him and that he should be sent to Oxford and Major Holmes had been interesting himself in this. He had got in touch, through the Oxford Appointments Bureau, with Mr. Gordon George, and was anxious to know how the matter would be viewed by us. In the light of previous discussion with Mr. Walton and with the Colonial Office I said that I thought that the question was one which would have to be dealt with through the political authorities. Major Holmes expressed great relief on hearing this. In the course of discussion I pointed out to him that the Sheikh*s son would be unlikely to secure admission at Oxford unless he could pass an entrance examination. Major Holmes said that on that assumption a tutor would be of great service to him and he might afterwards attend lectures at Oxford. I said that the Sheikh was no doubt prepared to foot the bill. Major Holmes said no difficulty would arise on this head and that he had informed the Sheikh that it would cost him at least £800 a year. The Sheikh was not anxious to have a European tutor in Koweit. It was agreed finally that Maj or/Major Holmes should write in setting out the position, with a view to a reply on the lines of the conversation reported above being given to him. (It might be added that who . . Mr. Gordon George/is at present working on manuscripts in the Foreign Office, told me before the interview that Major Holmes had informed him that he was the authorised representative of the Colonial Office in Koweit.) Bahrein Oil . It will be remembered that the Bahrein Petroleum Company have struck oil and are anxious to secure two minor modifications in their agreement. It has been agreed that this may be granted, but subject to a further modification in the interests of the Sheikh. Major Holmes said that the Company were extremely anxious to get an early decision and that he had learned from the Colonial Office of our desiderata and that no difficulty would arise over these* I said that if that was the case there seemed no reason why a decision should be delayed* He proceeded to discuss our requirement that he should spend most of the year in Bahrein, regarding which he said he had been informed by Mr. Jansfen, Junior, that I had CfVlIJ told him 'that we were not satisfied with the present ^ (f . condition of things, under which he spent a considerable portion of the year away from the islands. I said that as regards this we stood on our agreement; that possibly the point was one of less importance at the moment in the early stages of oil development in Bahrein, but that there could be no question if things developed further that he would be required to remain there for most of the year* Major Holmes expressed regret at this thri-e-and said that he hoped we should not make residence a further condition of our agreement to the modifications now desired by the Syndicate. 1/^ I have since discussed this point with Mr. Blaxter. It appears that 18 months ago, consequent £cC-&lt;J on a complaint by Sir Hugh Biscoe, we wrote to the Company pointing out that their chief local representative was, by the agreement, required to reside in Bahrein and asking them to guarantee that he would reside there not less than nine months in the year. No reply was received, nor v&amp;s any reply received to a reminder. I suggested to Mr. Blaxter that in these circumstances, particularly in view of the fact that important oil developments appeared to be pending, the present was our opportunity to secure a binding guarantee on this point from the Company. We are in a position to hold up the modifications of the lease which the Company desire unless they meet us over it. He agreed and suggest^ that this course be followed (Mr. Janssen and Major Holmes have applied for an interview with Mr. Parkinson in the immediate future). Wthat a further complaint has just been received from Sir Hugh Biscoe, who suggests that Major Holmes has spent only six months out of thirty in Bahrein and recommendsthat if he is not prepared to reside there he should be replaced as chief local representative by an American named Skinner, who is at present engaged on the Bahrein oil field. The appointment of an American as chief local representative may give rise to difficulty, but we need not for the moment go into it until we see the result of further conversation between the Colonial Office and Major Holmes. ( Major Holmes said that the oil which had been tapped was of first grade quality and purer by, I think, 1% than the average of the Anglo-Persian Oil in South Persia. All the indications were that Bahrein would be a paying proposition. He/7l He went on to say (Intimating that it was for my personal information, though it appears that the Colonial Office have also been informed) that patriotism was his loae star and that he was exceedingly anxious to do nothing (fa which could in any way embarrass bHrt thought that the Americans were not very happy in Bahrein and felt that they were within somebody else’s Monroe Doctrine. They would probably be glad at some later stage to transfer or sell their concession. What he, Major Holmes, hoped was that once oil had been put on a proper footing in Bahrein some negotiations might be possible, as a result of which British capital would again acquire complete control of the Bahrein oil field. The advantages of Bahrein as a naval supply depot, etc. were obvious. He feared, however, that H.M.G-. would insist on trying to work through the Anglo- Persian, who are not by any means popular along the Gulf. 6. Koweit Oil . Major Holmes said that it was a matter of complete Indifference to him whether or not the Eastern and General Syndicate secured an oil concession in Koweit. But the Sheikh was an old friend and he felt bound to do his best for him and also to do the best he could for his employers. He would therefore continue to press for the grant of the concession, more particularly as he had every reason to believe that Koweit was likely to be as sound a proposition from the oil point of view as Bahrein. He had been informed by the Colonial Office that the Anglo-Persian had mde application for a concession; that was, of course, none of his business and they were entirely at liberty to do so. They would, however, be well advised to watch their steps carefully. A Persian Consul-General (untesan) had remarked to him that any move by the Anglo-Persian to develop the oil resources of the non-Persian areas in the Gulf would be very badly received by the Persian Government. The/The Persian Government thought that there was plenty of oil for the Anglo-Persian in South Persia and the oil royalties were so important to them that they could not afford to lose any part of them. I have communicated~the gist of the above to the Colonial Office. Major Holmes is a very good business man, good tempered and an admirable bargainer, but having seen him one can understand the embarrassment which he might on occasion cause to the Political Agent in a small state like Bahrein or Koweit.
