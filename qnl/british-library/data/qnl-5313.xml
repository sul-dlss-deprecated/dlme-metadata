Copy of a letter from the Adjutant General in India, to the Lieutenant-Generals Commanding, No. t)64i-A., ' Officers— Discipline,' dated Fort William, the 17th March 1.904, It has come to the notice of the Commander-in-Chief that, notwithstanding the very clear and precise orders which have from time to time been issued to ensure the secrecy of docu ments, there have been instances recently where the most reprehensible laxity has been shown in the observance of those orders. 2, This laxity can obviously only have arisen from a want of adequate appreciation of the responsibility resting upon those to whose care these important secret documents have been entrusted, and in order that there may be no misunder standing in the future as to the serious nature of these respon- sibilities, the Commander-m-Chiof wishes all concerned to be informed that he intends to take the severest notice of any future neglect of the orders. 3. Under His Excellency's directions a copy of this letter will be attached to all documents, the secret nature of which may necessitate their being issued for the personal inform ation of those ooncemed.No. B. M.-ll. Camp Saniyeh, 16th November 1914. F rom Brigadier-General W. S. DELAMAIN, C.B., D.S.O., Commanding^ 16th Urigade, 1. E. F. ' D', To T he CHIEF of the GENERAL STAFF, SIMLA. Sir, On the arrival of Lieutenant-General Sir A. A. Barrett at this camp and on conclusion of my period of independent command I have the honour to report as follows :— 2. The force under my command, known as I. E. F. ' D', left Bombay on the 16th October in four Iransports, part of a large convoy. On 19th October we parted company and steered for Bahrain Islands, under escort of H. M. S. 'Ocean.' No. 1 Brigade, Indian Mountain Artillery, joined the force off Jask on the 21st. We arrived on the 2ord and anchored off Manama. Here we remained until the 2nd November. 3. On that date the Force sailed for the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab in com pliance with instructions contained in your radio telegram No 6571. Pilots were taken on board off Bushire and the Force arrived at the outer bar of the river on the evening of the 3rd November. 4. The 4th and 5th November were occupied with naval preparations and the transports themselves were prepared with bullet proof cover on the upper decks for the use of parties detailed for covering fire. Major Eadcliffe, 2nd Dorset Begiment, returned from Kuweit on 5th with information that the Fort was in ruins but that guns were in position. A landing force was detailed for the capture of Fao, under Lieutenant-Colonel II. L. Kosher, 2nd Dorset Begiment, and orders issued. On the 5th the trans ports crossed the outer bar of the Shatt-al-Arab and anchored just outside the inner bar. 5. At 6 a.m . on 6th November H. M. S. Odin,' preceded by launches sweeping for mines, stood in and bombarded the Turkish guns outside the Fort, 3 miles south-east of the telegraph station at Fao. The hostile guns were soon silenced; they were well served for a time and hit the ' Odin ' twice. On the signal being made that the guns were silenced the transports ' Umaria ' and ' Varela ' advanced in that order, each towing 8 boats full of troops along side ; the ' Mashona ' (armed launch) towed 7 boats full of troops and the Eoyal Navy steam launches towed the detachment of Marines from H. M. S. ' Ocean.' Off the Telegraph station the boats were cast off and made for the shore. Some 600 Infantry landed with 1 section. Mountain Artillery, complete with mules and 1 squad, Sappers and Joiners. There was no opposition. When the 1st and 2nd reinforcements had also landed. Colonel Rosher assembled his force and marched south-eastwards to occupy the Fort. This was accom plished during the night of the 6th—7th, the guns were dismounted and thrown into the river and Colonel 'Rosher's command returned to Fao.2 6. While the troops who had landed were being re-embarked on the 7th November, the General Officer Commanding with remaining transports proceeded up the river till within sight of the Oil Refinery on Abadan Island. On the 8th November the river was reconnoitred for a suitable landing place. A firm high bank with deep water close up to it was found at Saniyeh ; the transports were called up and troops began to disembark. The disembarka tion continued during 9th and 10th November being practically complete by evening of latter date. 7. It was proposed to advance from this camp and attack the Turks at Shamshumiya by land, but the reported advance of Turkish troops from Basrah and the necessity of safeguarding the Oil Works combined with the absence of news from India* regarding the *Tour telegram dated loth November inform- arrival of reinforcements decided me to ing me on this point was received by post on loth Saniyeh. With the intention November after the arrival of Sir A. Barrett. i £ j ^ 4- of an early forward movement, as little baggage and supplies as possible were landed at this camp. Reconnaissances bo3i up and down stream on the 9th and 10th failed to discover any enemy. 8. On the evening of the 10th reliable news was received from the Sheikh of Mohammerah that Sami Bey with a strong combined force of Turks and Arabs had arrived from Basrah at a point opposite Mohammerah with the intention of attacking our camp. At 3 a.m . on the 11th the Sheikh reported that Sami Bey had started to make the attack. Troops were turned out and outposts strengthened. The Turkish force, of whom over 300 were actually seen, delivered a determined attack at 5-30 a.m . on an advanced post held by one double company 117th Mahrattas with 2 machine guns.^ They advanced to within 50 yards of the post but were driven off by a dashing counter-attack delivered by the 20th Duke of Cambridge's Own Infantry, with the assistance of the 23rd Peshawar Mountain Battery. The enemy lost heavily in their retirement across the desert, 19 dead were counted, 14 wounded were brought in by us and 6 prisoners were taken. Abandoned rifles and equipment were found. The Turks officially acknowledged a loss of 80 men. 9. The defences of the camp were further strengthened and daily recon naissances made. On the 14th November, Lieutenant-General Sir A. Barrett with the 18th Brigade and Divisional Troops arrived at this camp. 10. I would invite attention to the difficulties of communication in the Persian Gulf during the period covered by this report. Constant thunderstorms interrupted the wireless system. -The installation on R. 1. M. S. ' DalhousiCj' is apparently of poor quality and the operators not very experienced. This ship had to be stationed at Bushire to connect with the cable there. The wireless station at Jask was frequently.in communication with H. M. S. ' Ocean ' in the sense that the station would answer the call of the warship but it would not take in any message for transmission. No night watch is kept at Jask. 11. Several points to which I would earnestly invite attention are men tioned in the 'Notes' made at intervals in the 'War Diary' which is forwarded by the same mail as this report. 12. I would mention that the stay of the Porce at Bahrain was of advantage as it enabled me to have British and Indian Corps instructed in rowing and handling of boats and to rehearse the operation of a landing in force. 13. All ranks have performed their duties in a most ^zealous and credit able manner. 14. I would bring to notice the great assistance given me by the following officers in planning and carrying out the operations for the occupation of Pao and the landing at this camp :— Captain Hayes-Sadler, R.N., Senior Naval Officer, H. M. S. Ocean'. Commander Hamilton, Royal Indian Marine, Principal Marine Trans port Officer.' Varela ' ' Umaria ' ' Umta ' ' Berbera ' ' Masunda.' / British ] l Navigatic India Steam ' Navigation Company. 15. I would also report that the masters of the various transports* gave all the assistance in their power. I would specially bring to notice the name of Mr. T. L. Mills, R.N.R., Master of the S. S. ' Varela,'* British India Steam Navigation Company, who displayed great zeal and willingness to perform operations beyond those usually required of a master of a merchant vessel. I trust that it will be found possible to recognize his services. 16. In connection with the Turkish night attack on the 11th November I would report that the counter-attack I ordered on the attacking force was carried out in a most dashing and skilful manner by the 20th Duke of Cambridge's Own Infantry and the 23rd Peshawar Mountain Battery under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel C. Battray, 20th Infantry. ✓ S;G.P. I„ Delhi—N o . 1341 C. G.
