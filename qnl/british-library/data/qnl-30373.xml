AIR MINISTRY, LONDON, S.W.i. 11th August, 1947* Sir, I an companded by the Air Council to say that they have been considering, in conjunction with the Colonial Office and the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the post economical and efficient arrangements for the operation of those post-war international trunk routes on which, for reasons of manpower and financial economy, and of geographical limitation, it is at present necessary for certain airfields to be used both by military and civil aircraft. 2. As a result of discussion in London, the principles set out in the attached Annex have been formulated and have been transmitted to Colonial Governments by the Secretary of State for the Colonies as in the despatches attached (Appendices ‘B* and 'C'). 3* I am to request that those principles may bo brought io the notice of Officers Co:.imanding and other authorities concerned in the adjministration and development of joint user stations* 4* The Council would welcome any comments on the ijinex which you may have to offer as a result either of previous experience in your Com and or of any discussions which you may hold with the local authorities concerned on the joint user plan as now proposed. am.

Overall Control . (a) Joint user airfields overseas are those on -which facilities are provided as of right on an agreed joint basis for both military and civil aircraft. Airfields at present in this category are shown in Appendix 'A*. The administration and organisation of such airfields will thus be the responsibility of the Air Officer Commanding concerned and of the local Government in whose territory the airfield is situated. It is not yet possible to define in detail the limits of the respective respon sibilities of the R,A,P. and Civil Authorities concerned. It will be necessary at each airfield for Air Officers Commanding to consult with local Governments in order to carry out the general principles which have been agreed, * • ...,/ (b) At joint user airfields the R.A.F. Commanding Officer will bear complete responsibility for the discipline and administration of service personnel and, within the limits normally applicable on an R.A.P, station, of any Air Ministry civil staff and employees. The administration and discipline of civilian staff employed by or on behalf of the local Government concerned will be the responsibility of.the local Government. An officer of the local Government concerned will be’ placed in charge of such civilian staff on an airfield. (c) Notwithstanding the fact that cither the Service or civilian interests on a particular airfield will always predominate, the R.A.P. Commanding Officer and the senior civil officer will each deal with their own subordinates only, so far as disciplinary enquiries and disciplinary action are concerned, except that in any cases where both Service and civilian interests may be affected a general enquiry may be held by mutual agreement. The R.A.P. Commanding Officer and the senior civil officer will each issue any day to day administrative instructions which may bo required to their own subordinates. At no joint user airfield mil there be any question of the dir: ct subordination of the senior civil officer to the R.A.F. Station Commander or vice-versa, but for operational convenience subordinate staff on duty may be placed in the charge of a senior officer, cither civil or R.A,P. (d) His Majesty's Government are bligod by international agree ments to provide facilities for the lawful passage of civil aircraft, both British and foreign, on the international trunk routes. Certain local air services operated by local airlines will also use joint user airfields. It is not possible for H.M.G. to deny the use of airfields open to inter national air traffic to international and local airlines (except in time of national emergency,, when the facilities may be denied to all operators either completely or partially on a non—discriminatory basis; a.ction in emergency would only be taken on instructions from, or with the specific approval of, departments in London,) It will not therefore be open to an R.A,P. Commander at a joint user airfield to issue orders precluding the use of the airfield by civil operators, British or foreign. It will be the responsibility of the local government to check the entitlement of civil operators. In the same way it will not* be open to a local government to prevent the passage of SeiVico aircraft in order to safeguard particular civil requirements. Clearance for the passage of foreign military aircraft will be co-ordina.ted by the Air Ministry, (o) In peace-time the R.A.F, have certain strategic obligations which can only be met by keeping open a certain defined route capacity v/hich may not be required in full except under threat of emergency,, but which must be kept at all times available. It may, therefore, be necessary at joint user airfields to formulate quotas for Service and civil use. The Service quota would take full account of strategic needs, and the civil quota would / be2 . 'be available for distribution among those civilicui operators who had been granted rights to operate to the airfield concerned. The quotas to be applied at each station would be a matter for separate discussion in ea^ch case and would, of c urse, be subject to revision both on account of any alteration by agreement in the balance of c.vil ana strategic ne^ds and of any physical alteration to the airfield which affected its total capacity. 2. A dministrative and financial Principles . Ownership (a) At all joint user airfields in Colonial or British influence territory there should be separate civil and R.^.F. sites, each as self- contained as possible, where the civil and service co'io.iiti.ients respectively should be handled. (b) On &amp;.A.F. airfields it is expected that the civil site w'uld either be owned by the local government concerned or held on long lease, e.g. fifty years. 3. Landing Fees . (a.) Local Governments will normally be responsible for collec tion of landing fees and concession rents. (b) Until local governments are in a position to take ovur, the should continue to collect fees. A. Works Services and Maintenance . (a) On R.A.F. airfields where.there is no site owned or leased by the local government, all Works Services in connection with the landing ground and buildings (both R.A.F. and civil) will be the respon sibility of A.M.W.D. (*) Where Works Services are required by the local government on a civil site owned or leased by them, the Colonial government concerned will be responsible for arranging for the design and execution of the work. At all joint user airfields responsibility for work on the landing ground, on the R.A.F. site, and on any other ar&lt;?a outside the government owned or leased civil site will rest with A.M.W.D. (c) In those cases where work is required to be carried out on behalf of B.O.A.C. , B.S.A.A. or B.E.A.‘, due note should be’ taken of the principles and channels laid down in A.M.O. A.-4-28/47 for obtaining the necessary authority. 5. Fire Fighting and M ed ical Services . The measure of integration of fire-fighting and medical services will depend upon local conditions. Such arrangements should be settled locally. 6* Telecommunications Facilities . (a) Air movement radio circuits (point-to-point and air/ground, land line circuits) navigation and landing aids, and control facilities will be used conjointly by R.A.F. and civil aircraft, on common air routes. (b) As a broad principle common signals and control procedures will be efmploycd 'm each common air route; it should be noted that in the / case G. 16.8153.APPENDIX ’A» 1 .

In the case of Negombo, negotiations will be carried out between the Air Ministry and the Ceylon Government, and the station cannot therefore be categorised as a joint user airfield under the general Air Ministry/lvliristry 0 f Civil Aviation/Colonial Office plan* It is hoped, however, that any agreement reached with the Ceylon Government for joint use at Negombo would be on the lines new proposed for other stations. i 3. Wadi Haifa and Gibraltar are not ''joint user' airfields for the purpose of the present plan. At the fonier, which is now fully civil-manned, the R.A.P. retain transit rights, and at the latter, which is fully service-manned, certain facilities have been made available for civil aircraft.

It is hoped to arrange for the implementation of facilities at Bahrain to be carried out by Cable and Wireless Limitedj and International Air Radio. The two companies have agreed that Cable and Y« ; ireless should undertake the provision of point-to-point facilities while International Air Radio should operate air-to-ground channels, radio navigational aids and such other communic ations as form an integral part of the airport system at Bahrain. 5. Salalah and Masirah are, as far as we know, maintained by the Royal Air Force on a care and maintenance basis and are not 'joint-user” airfields.

It will be necessarv a each airfield for Air Officers Commanding to consult with local Governments m order to carry out the general policy which has been agreed. I* . T ? le Commanding Officer will bear complete responsibility for the iscaplme and administration of service personnel and,-within the limits normally applicable on an R.A.F. station, of any Air Ministry civil staff and employees. The administration and discipline of civilian staff employed by or on behalf of the local Government concerned will be the responsibility of ' the local Government. An officer pf the local Government concerned will be placed in charge of such civilian staff. 4. Notwithstanding the feet that either the service or civilian interests on a particular airfield will always predominate, the R.A.F. Commanding' Officer and the Senior Civil Officer will each deal with their own subordinates only, so far as disciplinary enquiries and disciplinary action are concerned, except that in any cases where both service and civilian interests may be aifected, a general enquiry may be held by mutual agreement. The R.A.F. ommanding Officer and the Senior Civil Officer will each issue any day-to-day administrative instructions which may be required to their own subordinates, ihere will be no question of the direct subordination of the Senior Civil 'k° 'the R.A.F. Commanding Officer or vice versa but for operational convenience subordinate staff on duty may be placed in the charge of a Senior Officer either civil or R.A.F. p. His Majesty’s Government arc obliged, by international agreements, to provide facilities for the lawful passage of civil aircraft, both British and foreign, on the international trunk routes. Certain local air services operated by local airlines will also use joint-user airfields. It is not possible for H.M.G. to deny the use of airfields open to international air traf 1 ic to international and local airlines (except in time of national emergency when the facilities may be denied to all operators, either completely or partially, on a non-discriminatory basis; action in emergency would only be taken on instructions from or with the specific approval of Departments in London). It yd 11 not therefore be open to an R.A.F. Commanding Officer at a joint-user airfield to issue orders precluding the use /of erv* 16788 ,&lt;K CIV.16788. - 2 - of the airfield by civil operators, British or foreign. It will be 'the responsibility of the local Government to check the entitlement of civil operators. In the same way it will not be open to a local Government to prevent the passage of service aircraft in order to safeguard particular^civil requirements. Clearance for the passage of foreign military aircraft will be co-ordinated by the Air Ministry, 6, In peace-time the R.A.F. have certain strategic obligations ‘which can only bo met by keeping open a certain defined route capacity, which may not be required in full except under threat of emergency, but which must be kept at all times available. It may therefore be necessary at joint-user airtields to femulate quotas for service and civil use. The service quota* would take full account of strategic needs and the civil quota would be available for distribution among those civil operators who had been granted rights to. operate to the airfield concerned. The. quotas to be applied at each airfield would be a matter for separate discussion in each case and would be ^subject t** - revision on account of any alteration by agreement in the balance of civil an strategic needs or of any physical alteration to the airfield which affected its total capacity. FINANCE 7, In order to avoid complicated and unnecessary accounting the formula for the division of cost between R.A.F. and civil accounts should be simple to ^pply even if this entails a certain. sacrifice in accuracy of apportionment. 8, Because of the difference between the salaries, allowances,^conditions of service, etc. of R.A.F. and civil staffs the cost of control and telecomunications' staffs will bo omitted from the pool account (see . paragrai&gt;h 10 below) and an attempt will be made to obtain a fair division or cost by aldocating the facilities to be provided by the md Civil Authorities respectively on a basis proportionate to service and civil require me nt s • 9, Agreement will be reached from time to time on the capital expenditure on assets necessary to provide facilities for joint use, the ownership of which shall rest with one party. The owner of capital assets will then charge to the pool account a rental which will include amortisation of the capital value of the item over an agreed period of years. All equipment supplied solely for civil or R.A.F. use will be provided by the appropriate authori y and no charge will be made to the pool account; whore appropriate such equipment will be clearly marked. Fool Account 10. A pool account, normally maintained by the local Government, will be set up at each joint-user airfield to record actual expenditure and assess cosoS for the maintenance and operation of joint-user services other than expenditure on control and telecommunications staffs (see paragraph 8 ^ovu). These charges will be debited to the pool account and credited to the DcpartuantAr Govorr^nt that bears the expenditure in the frrat rnstanee or is entitled to the rental. Capital works and other services civil or solely for R.A.F. purposes '.vill be excluded. uanding .ee„ Jia concession rentals on the civil site will also be excluded. /DivisionCIV. 1678 a -3- Division of Costs 11. Each pool account will be adjusted after a period of six months from the date on which the account is opened and thereafter annually. 12. The pool account will be in two parts, Part I of which will represent the cost of maintenance and rental of the runways and taxiv/ays and Part II of which will include all other expenditure or rentals appropriate to the pool account. Part I will be divided between the R,A.F. and Civil Authorities in the ratio of the total weights of the aircraft landing - the weight being taken as the certified all-up weight. Part II will be divided in the ratio of the number of military to civil movements at the airfield, one movement of any military aircraft, except transport/communications aircraft based at the airfield, being taken as half a movement. This formula will be applied for a six month experimental period and thereafter if suitable. Should the formula prove unsatisfactory revised arrangements will be made. After the initial period of six months division of cost will take place annually. ADMINISTRATION Ownership 13* There will be separate civil and R.A.F. sites each as self-contained as possible where the civil and service commitments respectively will be handled. 14. It is expected that the civil site will either be owned by the local G-ovemment concerned or held on long lease, e*g. 50 years, from the R.A.F. Landing Fees 15* Local Governments will normally be responsible for the collection of lancing fees and concession rentals. 16 . Until local Governments arc in a position to take over the R.A.F. will continue to collect fees. V/orks Services and Maintenance 17. '.There there is no site owned or leased by the local Government, all works services in connection with tho landing ground and buildings (both R.A.F. and civil) will be tho responsibility of A.M.V.D.. 18. Where works services are required by the local Government on a civil site owned or leased by them, the local Government concerned will be responsible for arranging for the design and execution of the work. Responsibility for work on tho landing ground, on the-R.A.F. site and on any other area outside tho Government-owned or leased civil site, will rest with A.M. V'/. D.« Fire fighting and Medical services 19. The measure of integration of fire fighting and medical services will depend upon local conditions; such arrangements should be settled locally. Petrol, Oil and Lubricants 20. Where a separate civil site is in operation, civil aircraft will not /be-4- CIV. 1 6?88. /30. oo able to use xi.A.F. refuelling facilities; it will be the function of the Cl ^ ll -f Uonoi ’ :L c ' n ' trollin S civil s^te to arrange that civil aviation reluellang.facilities are available, For this purpose any ’space required by oil companies will be found on the civil site and all enquiries for such space or other matters concerned with the grant of rights to oil companies for rebelling civil aircraft will bo dealt with by the Civil Authority. 21. Where a separate civil site is not operating civil aircraft will be al^ov.'..d to use the R.A.F. refuelling facilities currently available. No other facilities will be permitted on the airfield except by special arrangement. SUPPLY 22. In the period during which equipment designed for post-wa,r civil aviation is unobtainable the R.A.P. will continue to make available from stocks P existing types of R.A.F. equipment and associated spares in present use. 2P-* Vfhen equipment of will be responsible for spares. Similarly the associated spares. now types becomes available, the Civil Authoriti supplying all civil type equipment.and associate^ luA.F. will supply all service type equipment and ihe stages by \.hich : md the extent to which civil type equipment is introduced will be arranged between the Air Ministry, M.C.A. and other Departments ano. Overseas Administrations concerned. LEGAL LIABILITY 25 . ^ Ihe question of legal liability in respect of actionable damage resulting from errors committed by ground personnel (control and telecommunications staff etc,) is governed by general principles of lav/ as set out hereunder. These principles will not be affected by the fact that an airfield is joint-user. 26, Furthermore the principles referred to also apply whether the ground personnel arc servicemen or civilians and whether the aircraft or other property damaged is State or civil, British or foreign. Tort 27® ^ If there is negligence in the U.K. in relation to any aircraft an action for tort will lie in the U.K.; if the negligence occurs in a foreign country an action for tort will lie in the U.K. if the act complained of is both wrongful in the foreign country and actionable if committed in the U.K. 28^ In territories './here the Crown Proceedings Act, 1947» does not apply, if the R»A,F. or M.C.A. employ a controller etc., the employing authority would normally, according to current practice, meet the cost of any damage resulting from errors of the employee v/hich amount to negligence actionable in the English courts,- There the authority employing the controller, etc. is a colonial or local Government abroad the law of the place will apply. In general it may perhaps be assumed that Colonies etc, would bo likely to follow the generally accepted procedure of making ex gratia payments where liability of the employee is reasonably clear and otherwise leaving the aggrieved person with only his remedy, if any, against the individual tort feasor.-5- CIV, 1 6788 , 29« In territories where the Crown Proceedings Act, 19A7, is in force (e.g, the U.K.) where the R.A.F. or M.C.A. employ a controller the Crown (i.e* R.A.P. or M.C.A.) will be liable to be sued in tort* 30. The Act in its application to torts is only concerned with torts of servants of the Crown remunerated out of the consolidated fund monies provided by Parliament etc.. Provided the tortfeasor is so remunerated the Act applies wherever the tort is committed but there can be no question of its 'extension' to cover cases where the employing authority is a colonial or local Government; in such cases the local lav/ would still apply (see paragraph 28 above). Contract 31* So far as liability in contract is concerned it will depend on the 'proper law of the contract', i.e. the lav which the parties intend shall govern the contract. In default of evidence as to intention this is usually taken to be the law of the place where the contract was made. 32. The contract of employment might affect the relations between employer and employee in the case of an accident but it could not govern the relations of employer or employee with third parties. For example there night be a condition that the employee should be dismissed if an action in an English court established that he was negligent in discharging his duties; but there could not be a condition that the employer would not bo liable to third parties for the torts of the employee. 33* Liability as between the employing authority and tho person suffering damage may be affected by any contract between them. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL General 34. All control procedures, whether control is by R.A.F. or civil, will be those.formulated by I.C.A.O. 33* In the case of civil aircraft control procedures can be advisory and not mandatory. Airfield and Approach Control 36 . One authority, either R.^.F. or civil, will be responsible for airfield (and where applicable approach) control. 37. This authority will also bo responsible for the manning of all ground ^services concerned with control, with tho exception of telecommunications, required to cover both R.A.F. and civil needs, without regard to the number of personnel involved. 38 . Where civil control staff take over before the introduction into the R.A.F. of full I.C.A*0. procedures an R.A.F. control officer will be retained to ensure that R.A.F. aircraft are controlled in accordance with current R.A.F. regulations. 39. Where the control authority is civil the provision of information of a 'restricted' category concerning purely R.A.F. facilities will be the responsibility of the R.A.F. flight planning staff located at the airfield concerned. , - 40. When the R.A.F. require to use airfields for operational or training purposes where the control authority is civil, they will put in R.A.F. staff /toCIV. 16788. - 6 - to assist the civil control staff. Approach Jontrol k l' Wh ?iT® * he are responsible for airfield and approach control, staffs will be combined. ' Air Traffic Control Centres Control Centres will become the responsibility of one authority, either R.A.P. or civil. (Note. Such responsibility will (a) Positive control responsibility within the region as may be dei inea as agreed in each instance. ' ^ ii^^ information service including diversion and distress advice for all aircraft in communication with the Centre. (c) Co-ordination with zone, approach and airfield control as necessary. (d) Initiation of requests to the R.oj-.F. as required, for the alerting of the Search and Rescue organisation.) Ap. jit Air Traffic Control Centres of strategic importance to the R.A.P. maintained by the Civil Authority the R.A.P. will retain the right to establish an k.A,P. aeronautical information and liaison section to:— (a) Provide aeronautical information which will not normally be available to the civil control staff about purely R.A.P. facilities. (b) Make mandatory decisions when required in respect of R.A.P. aircraft other than those flying on the' overseers trunk routes, (c) Alert the Search and Rescue organisation when required to do so by control. . ' . . BRIEFING- 44. It has not yet proved possible to agree principles on briefing. A trial integration of briefing staffs is to be carried out over a period of three months. 45. The- results of this- trial will then be considered v/ith a view to the establishment of agreed principles. T SLECQMvIUNI CATIQNS ♦ 46. Air movement radio circuits (point-to-point, air/ground and landline circuits), navigation and landing aids and control facilities will be used jointly by R.A.P. and civil aircraft on common air routes. 47. On common air routes responsibility for the operation .and maintenance of telecommunications facilities agreed to be required for these routes will be divided between R.A.P. and civil on an agreed ratio. 48. One authority,-either R.A.P. or civil* will exercise the overall operational control of all joint-user facilities, will undertake the co ordination of siting, technical works services and installation of radio /equipment-7- equipment required by the R.A.F. or Civil Authorities and will be responsible for the overall technical efficiency and operation of telecommunications staff and equipment* The choice of authority as between R.A.F. and civil will in each case be settled by discussion between the Departments concerned and in consultation with the local authorities® In general the larger user will predominate but due weight must also be given to strategic factors. 49* As a broad principle common procedures will be 'employed on each common air route. 50. As far as possible joint-user radio and control facilities will employ I.C.A.O. standards and frequencies. 31. As a long-term policy adequate training in I.C.A.O. procedures will be included in the syllabuses of R.A.F. signals training schools^ 52. A joint aeronautical communications traffic office will be required to deal with aeronautical traffic as classified by I.C.A.O*. 33* It is hoped eventually that the aeronautical fixed telecommunications service will function as a separate organisation from other service and civil administrative and operational circuits. 54* Air/ground circuits at Air Traffic Control Centres will be civil manned. 53* Where the R.A.F. operate airfield and approach control they will as far as possible also operate and maintain the associated radio facilities and vice versa* 36* Where main point-to-point and air/greund channels are civil manned the traffic office will as far as possible also be civil manned and vice versa. 57* Appropriate arrangements will need to be made for the provision of any additional telecommunications staff required to meet any large and sustained increase in air movements that may arise 0 » 58* During the initial period of build-up and development it will be ' necessary to review the joint plan as a whole from time to time.

The pool account will be in two parts. Part I of which will represent the cost of maintenance and rental of the runways and ■ taxiways and Part II of which will include all other expenditure or rentals appropriate to the pool account. Part I will be divided between the R.A.F, and Civil Authorities in the ratio of the total weights of the aircraft landing - the weight being taken as the certified all-up weight. Part II will be divided in the ratio of the number of military t., civil movements at the airfield* Move ments of military aircraft that are based at the airfield will count as half a movement, with the exception of Transport Command aircraft. The latter and all other movements, both civil and military, will be regarded as one movement.' 'Yorks Services and Maintenance Para. 18 Add at end of last sentence ' Should the local Government desire for any reason to initiate works services on ary area of a joint - user airfield outside the civil site the proposals will, in the first instance, be the subject of consultation between the local Government and the local R.A.F* Commanding Officer. In cases of difficulty the R.A.F. Commanding Officer will refer the proposals to the Air Ministry, and the local Government to the Colonial Office or other appropriate Department.

Air Traffic Control Centre - Malta At this location, in order to reduce manpower commitments and in vlqsi^ of the close proximity of the centre to airfield/approach control, it has beei - decided that the R.A.F. Aeronautical Information and Liaison Section will be established as part of the Luqa airfield/approach control section. Further, in view of the strong strategic interest which the R.A.F. have in this centre, it had been agreed that;- (a) Control of all policy matters connected with the organisation and implementation of air traffic control within the Malta F.I.R. and in relation to co-ordination with adjacent F.I.R. control authorities shall be exercised through the A.O.C. Malta. These will be the subject of discussion and agreement between the Air Ministry, Colonial Office and M.C.A. in the first instance whenever a major change is proposed. The position will be reviewed when a D.C.A. is appointed by the Malta CovernmEint. (b) The Civil Senior Air Traffic Control Officer shall, after informing the A..O.C., have the right to refer such policy matters to his Civil Superiors. (c) The A.O.C. will exercise such control as necessary through the staff of his Air Headquarters and through -j^he Civil Senior Air Traffic Control Officer at' the centre. (d) The Air Traffic Control Centre shall comprise a Civil Senior Air Traffic Control Officer and his Control Officers and .divil assistants, whose responsibility shall be to provide day to day flight information service. (e) In an emergency the R.A.F. will take complete charge of the Ai^' Traffic Control Centre. (f) The Senior R.A.F. Air Traffic Control Officer at Luqa or his deputy shall have access to the Air Traffic Control Centre at all times. Mandatory decisions in respect of R.A.F. aircraft shall in each instance l&gt;e referred to this officer or his deputy. 6 .
