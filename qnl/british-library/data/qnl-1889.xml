(Vide paragraph 1 of Memorandum Situation in Persia. ^ly 1909.) On the deposition of the Shah, Muhammad Ali, the control of affairs in Persia was entrusted to a directory of twenty persons including the Sipahdar, Minister of War, the Sardar Assad, Minister of the Interior, Nasr-ul-Mulk, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik, Minister of Finance, and Firman Firma, Minister of Justice. On the 26th July Sir E. Grey requested His Majesty’s Ambassador at Paris to convey to Nasr-ul-Mulk, who was still in Europe, though he had announced his acceptance of office, the earnest hope of His Majesty’s Gov ernment that he would enter on his duties with out delay. On the 30th July it was authorita tively announced that Colonel Liakhoff, Com manding the Cossack brigade, was relinquishing his post. On the 21st July Sir G. Barclay tele graphed that so far as he could judge by the reports he had received, a very good impression had been produced by the change of Rulers. Elections for the Assembly at Tehran, to be held under the new electoral law, were fixed for the 6th, 7th and 8th August. The new Persian Government issued a circular enjoining upon provincial assemblies the necessity for doing their utmost to calm down anti-Russian agitation. At the same time the Persian Minister at St. Petersburgh was directed to enquire whether Russia saw her way to withdrawing Russian troops located in Persian territory. He was informed in reply that this could not be done until it was clear that order had definitely been re-established. On the 6th August it was reported that a special tribunal, which had been constituted to deal with political offenders, had been dissolved, after ordering four executions. Excellent order was being maintained in Tehran. Meanwhile, the attention of the Persian Government was occupied with the question of the disposal of the ex-Shah. His Majesty’s continued presence in Persia was recognised by them and by the two Powers to be undesirable, as he formed a centre for. intrigue and appeared to be encouraged by his adherents to believe that Russia would replace him on the throne, an2 idea which His Majesty the Czar attempted to dispel in his reply to a telegram despatched to him hy the ex-Shah shortly after his deposition. On the 24th July a deputation from the Nationalist Committee waited on the ex-Shah with a view to obtaining possession of the Crown jewels, and to offer him a pension of 25,000 tomans annually. No settlement, how ever, was arrived at. On the 3rd August, as the result of negotiations entered into by the two Legations with the ex-Shah and members of the Nationalist Committee, a protocol was signed by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, certain members of the Nationalist Committee and the dragomans of the Russian and British Legations, under which it was arranged that all jewels found, after enquiry by represent atives to the two Legations, to belong to the Crown, and all documents relating thereto should be given up by the ex-Shah, who was to leave Tehran hy the 17th August. In return the Persian Government offered to give him a pension of 75,000 tomans annually. On the 4th August the investigation referred to in the protocol was held, and, under great pressure, the ex-Shah handed over a large quantity of jewels which he had hitherto maintained to be his private property. On the 12th August Mr. O’Beirne reported that the Czar’s assent to the ex-Shah residing at Kieff was likely to be given next day, but that one difficulty in the way of his departure from Persia still existed in the debt of three million roubles owed by him to the Russian Bank. Por this debt it appeared that the Shah’s private property was mortgaged to the Bank. The Russian Gov ernment were unable to assent to the ex-Shah’s departure until the Persian Government should guarantee payment from the income of the ex-Shah’s estates in Azerbaijan. Meanwhile they were keeping a ship ready to convey him to Petrovsk. Early in July anti-Russian agitators at Tabriz held a meeting Situation in Azerbaijan. ^ ^ principal mosqu0 at which the boycott of Russian goods was advocated. The more respectable inhabitants did not attend and the meeting proved a failure. The Russian Government, however, regarded the situation as unsatisfactory, Sattar Khan having announced that he was to be made Governor-General and the agitation against the presence of Russian troops being continued. The Russian Charge d’Aifaires at Tehran was accordingly instructed to press on the Persian Government the necessity of sending immediately to Tabriz a Governor- General with troops, in default of which Russia would herself take action. On the 19th July the Turkish Ambassador at St. Peters- burgh stated that orders had been sent to the Turkish Consul-General. at Tabriz that Sattar3 and Bagher Khan should no longer be afforded bast in the Turkish Consulate-General. On the 20th July it was reported that Mukhber-es- Sultaneh, whose appointment would be very popular in Tabriz, was to be appointed Gov ernor, and two days later Sir G. Barclay joined with his Russian colleague in urging on the Persian Government the necessity of sending to Tabriz a Governor with a suitable escort. On the 25th July it was reported that the Turkish Consul-General had left Tabriz, but without Sattar and Bagher Khan who were being encouraged by the Nationalist Com mittee at Tehran to come to the capital. On the 29th July Mr. Wratislaw communicated the information that the Russian troops were considering the preparations necessary for a prolonged stay in Tabriz, but on the 7th August he stated that two companies of infantry and one field battery, in all 700 men, would shortly be withdrawn. (Fide paragraph 1 of Memorandum .. .... for July 1909.) Soulat- ed-Dowleh, the Kash- gai Chief, who insisted on the cancellation of the appointment of Ala-ed-Dowleh to the Governorship of Pars and who was actually on the move with a following of at least 2,000 men, was interviewed by Mr. Bill outside Shiraz and prevailed upon by him to agree to a halt of three days. Subsequently there was some improvements in the situation though some anxiety continued to be felt owing to the uncertainty as to who was to be appointed Governor of the province. As a result however of the strong opposition of the Kashgais, Ala-ed-Bowleh’s appointment was cancelled, and Ain-ed-Dowleh was announced to be the governor-designate. But, with the arrival of Taki Zadeh, Ain-ed-Dowleh’s appointment was revoked, and Saham-es- Sultaneh was nominated to the governorship of Pars. The new incumbent has hitherto only held minor governorships. The small reinforcement, which left Bushire on the night of the 25th July, arrived at Shiraz on the 2nd August. Their arrival was received quietly. Two sepoys succumb ed to heat apoplexy en route. Major Cox reported on the 7th August that the anxiety regarding Shiraz seemed to have passed for the present and that Mr. Bill was prepared to dispense with a portion of the reinforcements. Sir G. Barclay authorised the proposed reduction and hoped that the main body would be able to return on the arrival at Shiraz of the governor-designate. (Vide paragraph 1, page 10 of Memorandum for July Sttucttzoft at K-BTYnaVi^ -i f i \ t i x xi W09.) In reply to the telegram from the Government of India of the4 24th July, instractions were received from His Majesty’s Secretary of State for troops to he held in readiness for despatch to the Persian Gulf in case of need. The measure was purely precautionary and no further action was to be taken without definite orders. Arrangements were made accordingly. On the 20th August His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, reported that the Kawamis intended to overrun Kerman, Khorasan and Yezd. Pour days later Kafsinjan was hotly attacked by 800 robbers; the situation was most serious owing to the temper of the tribes being reckless and two telegraph employes, Messrs. Wright and James, were in grave danger, being in the midst of the fight ing. The former was captured on the 19th August by Arabs near Kamalabad, one of his escort being shot, but was released on the 22nd after being stripped. The brigands then left the vicinity moving towards Pars. On receipt of information regarding the serious situation in Kerman, the Secretary of State was informed on the 25th August 1909 that a force was ready to move at a moment’s notice and that instructions were awaited. But the danger to Kerman passed with the dis appearance of the robbers and subsequently comparative quiet was restored. The Secre tary of State replied that no troops from India would be required, as they would arrive too late to prevent a temporary raid of this nature. 2. (Vide paragraph 3 of Memorandum The Zii-es-Sultan. July 1909.) The Zil-es-Sultan, m spite of all the efforts of the British and Bussian Ambassadors to dissuade him, left Vienna on bis return journey to Persia on the 30th July 1909. The Constantinople Anjuman tele graphed to Samsam-es-Sultaneh urging upon him to frustrate any attempts of the Zil-es- Sultan to obtain the Begency in the place of the Azad-el-Mulk. The Bussian Minister seemed to apprehend that, if the Zil-es- Sultan returned, the provisional Government might place him on the throne. He wrote to Sir G. Barclay to say that; such a selection “ would make the position of the Bussian Minister for Poreign Affairs intolerable and might even jeopardise our accord”. Sir G. Barclay thought that, though it was not the most probable development, the selection of the Zil-es-Sultan could not altogether be excluded. No sooner, however, had he entered Persian territory, than he was stopped near Mangel by the Persian Government and subsequently taken in custody to Besht. His sons appealed to the British Minister to obtain his release, but Sir G. Barclay refused to intervene. A direct appeal was then made to His Majesty’s Government, and telegraphing on the 10th of August on behalf of his father, the Zil,Akbar Mirza, stated that, though the latest assurances regarding the ZiPs property were annulled by his return to Persia contrary to the advice of His Majesty’s Government, he believed that the older assurances, promising protection to his life, honour, and family should he remain loyal to the Shah, still held good, and he begged that, if this view of his was held by His Majesty’s Government, Sir G. Barclay might be instructed to help him to return to Europe safely. Sir E. Grey proposed to reply to this communication that, though His Majesty’s Government were dispensed from all guarantees when the Zil-es-Sultan returned to Persia against their advice, the British Government would do what they could to facilitate his exit to Europe. Sir G. Barclay who was again approached by the sons of the Zil-es-Sultan, though he was of opinion that the latter by neglect of the advice which had been given to him, had forfeited all claim to our intervention based on the assurances given by His Majesty’s Government, proposed to express to the Persian Government his hope that the Zil would be allowed to return in safety to Europe, and to ask his Bussian colleague to join with him in the re presentation. 3. (Vide paragraph 5 of the Memo- Telegraph lines in randum for July 1909.') Persia. On the 2nd August 1909, His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, reported to His Majesty’s Government that the new Persian Minister of Telegraphs had asked the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment to erect the second line from Tehran to Shahrud in the autumn. Sir G. Barclay suggested that a definite reply should be avoided as long as possible, in view of the connection between this and the question of the exchange of telegraph lines; and of the necessity of postponing the latter question until the Arabistan Convention had been sub mitted to the Persian Assembly. 4. (Vide 'paragraph 6 of the Memoran- The Russian Bank in duw&gt; for July 1909.) Seistan. The local Manager of the Imperial Bank has informed His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed that the question of the transfer to the Imperial Bank of Persia of the liabilities of the Russian Bank in Seistan has fallen through owing to the departure of the former Manager of the Russian Bank; hi# that, should he return, it will possibly be re-opened. 5. (Vide paragraph 7 of the Memo- Proposed establish, randum for July and ment of a Customs paragraph 4 Of the Bureau at Birjand. Memorandum for June 1909!) The Persian Customs Department6 have informed His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran that, before definitely considering the question of a Customs Bureau at Birjand, they are desirous of seeing some further progress on the Palang Koh route, which, they say, is not generally open to traffic. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan, has informed Sir G. Barclay that the Palang Koh route requires further work to make it a good road, but that it is now in general use, being up to the standard of other roads in that part of Persia and better than the Koh-i-Malik-Siah-Seistan road. 6. (Vide paragraph 6 of the Memo- The Russian Consular vandum for June 1909.} Staff in Seistan. j) r Kosminsky has informed the Consul, Seistan, that the Bussian Vice-Consulate in Seistan had been definitely and permanently extended to embrace Kain, which had consequently been separated from Turbat-i-Haidari. The Seistan appointment would, he said, remain a Vice-Consulate, but Baron Tcherkasoff, who had been appointed to bold it, would have the rank and status of Consul. Hr. Kosminsky added that neither he nor Dr. Otto had any powers, but the flag was being flown at his house as the records were there. Dr. Otto was himself uncertain as to his position, as he informed His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Seistan, that his one difficulty was now whether he was acting as Bussian Vice-Consul or not. Baron Tcherkasoff arrived at Birjand on the 18th July 1909. 7. (Vide paragraph 6 of the Memo- Colonel von der randum for April Flaas, Russian Military 1909.) Colonel von Attache in Seistan. der Military Attach^ in Seistan, has told His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul that he hopes to leave Seistan shortly to take up the command of a regiment in the Pamirs. It is also reported that Colonel von der Plaas is making enquiries regarding troops, arms, equipment, &amp;c., in the Perso-Afghan frontier districts. A long list of queries is apparently being confidentially circulated by Bussian Agents and rewards offered for the necessary information. His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul reports that the list seems hondjide and includes queries such as length of bayonet, weight of rifle, how repairs are effected and the locality of workshops, supply of uniforms, transport arrangements, &amp;c. 8. (Vide paragraph 8 of the Memo- Seizure of a Maskat r ^ nd ^ m f° r ^ly 1909.) dhow by the Italian On the 5th August, the Benadi/cVast 8 . ° n the Resident at Aden tele graphed that the Italian statement that the “local authorities” had recognised the legality of the seizure, was incorrect. On the 11th the Secretary of StateI 7 telegraphed the gist of the Italian statement of the case. The only fresh statement of facts were that the Sultan’s flag was not torn up and that the dhow-owner was released on condition that he signed a written decla ration that his rights in the vessel must be regarded as having lapsed, in the event of his not surrendering himself to the Italian authorities, and that the dhow would then become the absolute property of the Italian Government. The Italian note repeated the offer to release the dhow if the Sultan and the owner recognised the legality of the seizure, but took no notice of the statement that His Majesty’s Government would refrain from formulating a definite claim for compensation until they knew what action the Italian Gov ernment had taken. His Lordship enquired how the matter stood locally and stated that no reply would be sent to the note pending a reply from the Government of India. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was asked for a report. Later in the month a report was received from the Political Agent, Maskat, stating that another dhow had recently been seized by the Italian author ities and that the Sur dhow owners were very anxious about their vessels trading with the African coast. The owners intimated that they proposed to go in force to Maskat to ascertain what the real nature of the difficulty was, and that, if something was not done soon, they would take the law into their own hands and deal harshly with any dhows flying the Italian flag in Oman waters. The Political Agent was of opinion that the trouble would grow until something decisive happened. On the 24th August, the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf was asked to telegraph his views on the Italian statement. 9. {Vide paragraph 16 of the Memo- B ,. randum for May 1909.) sa?y e a n t m Mutrah b^tne On the 14th August, American Mission at the Political Agent, Maskat ' Maskat, reported that it would be desirable to settle the question of the American dispensary at Mutrah before the arrival of an American, named Ray, who had been appointed Consul at Maskat. The Poli tical Resident, Persian Gulf, added that the Consul was being sent to settle the question, and that the Sultan should be informed as soon as possible whether or not His Majesty’s Government could support him in maintain ing the attitude he had taken up. On the 17th August, the Secretary of State was asked whether the desired assurance could be given.8 10. {Vide paragraph 16 of the Memo- Persian claim to r for sovereignty over 1909.) On the 13th Bahrein. Mayj Sir G Barclay addressed a note to the Persian Government informing them that His Majesty’s Govern ment had approved his action in accepting the amended note sent him bv the Persian * Government in January last {vide paragraph 16 of the Memorandum for March 1909), but that they maintained, as regards the status of Bahrainis in Persia, the attitude explained in Mr. Marling’s note, dated the 30th March 1908, viz., that the island of Bahrain and its inhabitants were considered to be under British protection. Sir G. Barclay added that His Majesty’s Government would be guided entirely by their own views of the position should any action of the Persian authorities make representations necessary. In forwarding a copy of this note to Sir E. Grey on the 1th June, Sir G. Barclay explained that, as the wording of the commu nication had been left to his discretion, he had omitted the words “ His Majesty’s Govern ment cannot consider this arrangement as final ” {vide paragraph 17 of the Memorandum for April 19u9), as he thought that these words might provoke a reply and that the moment was inopportune for pressing the Bahrein question to an issue. His Majesty’s Government approved the terms of Sir G. Barclay’s note to the Persian Government. 11. (Vide paragraph 19 of the Memo- Nejd affairs. randum for June im.) JNejd continues m a state of turmoil owing to the quarrels of Ibn Saud and Ibn Sebhan, the guardian of Ibn Bashid, rival claimants to the Emirlik of the Nejd. After the counter raids of Pebruary last {vide paragraph 18 of the Memorandum for April 1909), Ibn Saud returned to Biadh with a slight wound in his leg and caused rumours to be circulated among the tribes that he had subsequently died. Zamil-ibn-Sebhan, having heard this news, concluded that there was no necessity for keeping any further a large force under arms, and disbanded a great part of his men. He then camped at the western frontier of Kassim, encouraging his rival to emerge from concealment at the head of a large force chiefly of the Muteir tribe and Kassim people. These made a raid against the Shammar and Harb tribes in Jebel Tai from which Ibn Saud returned with an enormous booty. On his way back, however, to Kassim he was confronted by Ibn Sebhan and his allies, and a fierce engagement ensued with considerable loss on both sides, while much of the booty was re-taken.9 12. In March last, tlie Political ^Resident Attempt by the in the Persian Gulf re- Turkish authorities at ported that the Sheikh Basrah to register the r n , Sheikh of Koweit as a 01 Koweit had pur- Turkish subject. chased certain property in the Vilayat of Basrah and that the Turkish authorities at that place had refused to register the transfer of the land unless the Sheikh was described on the transfer papers as an Ottoman subject. Major Cox suggested that His Majesty’s Government should be moved to take steps to induce the Porte to discontinue this demand for the independent registration of Koweitis as Turkish subjects and to bring about an improvement in the attitude of the Vali of Basrah. On the 3rd July, the Government of India asked Major Cox whether the question was still acute, whether any further develop ments had occurred and whether he still considered it desirable to represent the matter to the Porte. It was thought possible that the appointment of a new Yali at Basrah, which had taken place in the meanwhile, had affected the position. On the 17th August, Major Cox replied that it did not seem necessary to make any representations to the Porte, as the Sheikh had come to an understanding with the newly- appointed Vali. 13. (Fide paragraph 14 of the Memo randum for July 1909.) Murder of certain ^ a / subjects of the Chief of Gn the 20th August, Abu Thabi by residents the Political Resident ofTaona. ^ Persian Gulf telegraphed to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, that the new Sheikh of Abu Thabi had refused to accept responsibility for the safe custody of the pirate on the grounds that the relations of the murdered men then in Abu Thabi would make trouble if the prisoner were not delivered into their hands. He was, therefore, for the time being left in the custody of the Political Agent, Bahrein. On hearing of the capture of their brother, the other two brothers fled to the mainland and the Sheikh of Charek promised to do his best to effect their apprehension. Major Cox, however, was doubtful of success and added that H. M.’s Ships would not be able to act again for some time. As the prisoner would, in all probability, be allowed to escape, as one brother did from Shiraz, if he were handed over to the^ local authorities, Major Cox asked His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, whether he saw any objec tion to the retention of the prisoner by the Political Agent, Bahrein, for the present.
