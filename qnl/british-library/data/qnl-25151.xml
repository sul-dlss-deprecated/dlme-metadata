Your telegram leaves no room for hope that the culprits will he handed over to the Persian Government within three weeks. This, as you know, was the condition of our withdrawing troops from Bushire. If we are compelled to stay on, we must build barracks at Shiraz, so that no extension of time could be granted to the Persian Government within which to comply unless they undertook to refund the cost of the barracks when evacuated. I presume, however, that it is beyond the power of the Persian Government to fulfil the first condition, though you will know whether they have or have not made any attempt to negotiate with the tribes for the surrender of the guilty parlies. If proof be produced that the Nejef clergy have telegraphed to the tribes, can it not be said that Persian Government have fulfilled our conditions to the best of their ability ? If so, it becomes a question whether it is politic to continue to insist on surrender of culprits or whether it might not be waived or something else substituted. I do not gather that the presence of the troops at Shiraz adds to our prestige or is of any practical advantage, so that if they could be withdrawn without loss of face no harm would ensue.

Only to-day has his successor been definitely named in the person of Ala-es-Sultaneh. Minister of Interior called on me this morning. He assured me that he has been seriously considering question since he took office three weeks ago, and has sent urgent telegrams to Shiraz insisting upon arrest of the culprits. He added that the new Governor-General Mukhber-es-Sultaneh is leaving in a few days for his post, and that he hopes matters may improve greatly after his arrival. All the same, I doubt power of the present Government to arrest culprits, who are powerful chiefs. It would appear that they are not with Soulet, as was asserted by late Minister for Foreign Affairs.

He stated a week ago that he was not in possession of promised telegram from the Ulema. I have, however, received a copy of it from a private, but entirely reliable, source ; it is dated 19th May and appears to me satisfactory, as it calls upon people to ‘ respect life and property of foreigners, especially of British subjects, since Great Britain is the protector of Islam and of independence of Persia. Exception may possibly be taken to the doxology, in which a hope is expressed that His Majesty’s Government will observe friendly and dignified neighbourly relations, preserve international rights, and recall their troops from Persia at an early date. Surrender of assailants can only be secured through Shiraz Government. Efforts in that direction are being made, and preparations for departure of Governor-General renewed.

[16163] No. 1. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 18.) (No. 65.) Sir, Tehran, April 5, 1912. WITH reference to your telegram No. 232 of the 2nd instant, I have the honour to transmit copy of a note which I addressed yesterday to the Persian Government. You will notice that this note contains no mention of the scheme for direct negotiations with the tribal chiefs. No mention of this scheme had been made by me officially to the Persian Government, and I therefore thought it better to inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs merely privately in the sense of the ante-penultimate paragraph of your telegram, and I wrote on the 3rd instant to the “ Chef de Cabinet,” who, as I reported in my telegram No. 218 of the 28th ultimo, had written to me on the subject, asking him to inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the scheme of subsidising the local chiefs would not have been executed without the concurrence and approval of the Persian Government, and that the prestige of the Central Government would have been carefully safeguarded. You will Notice also that in my note I merely, as regards the extremists, requested the Persian Government to restrain those persons in Tehran and elsewhere in Persia whose inflammatory telegrams had been largely responsible for the attacks on our troops, and that I did not insist on these persons recanting their telegrams. It seemed to me that to insist on the recantation of these inflammatory telegrams would have had the effect of giving the extremists an exaggerated idea of their importance, and I have said nothing about the removal of the Kawam from Fars. If later, on the arrival at Shiraz of the new Governor-General, it is still thought desirable that Kawam should leave Fars, the legation could endeavour to induce the Persian Government to give him a good post elsewhere. I did not understand from your instructions that I was to say anything about the occupation of Bassidu. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 1. Sir G. Barclay to the Persian Government. M. le Ministre, Tehran, April 4, 1912. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency’s note of the 10th ultimo, and to take act of the assurances that the sum of 4,744L will be paid out of the next loan. I am now instructed to make the following communication to the Persian Government:— His Majesty’s Government have carefully considered the whole situation in the south of Persia, with special reference to the recent attacks on the Indian troops dispatched from Shiraz and Bushire to escort Mr. Smart, His Majesty’s acting consul at Shiraz, who was returning from leave to his post. His Majesty’s Government consider it essential that the men who are well known locally to have been guilty of these outrages should be handed over to the Persian Government for punishment. If this is done, His Majesty’s Government will at once withdraw the detachment recently sent to Bushire ; and if the tribal chiefs and head men show a friendly feeling and peaceful attitude for at least two months, and no more outrages occur during that period, the withdrawal of the Indian cavalry reinforcements from Shiraz and Ispahan will follow. I am, however, to make the Persian Government understand that the continuance of this benevolent attitude on the part of His Majesty’s Government must depend on the proper establishment of a gendarmerie under Swedish officers, and the Persian [2440 s—1] 10 MAY 1912 N 2 $ ^r;'&amp;~ S 2 Government must therefore undertake before the final withdrawal of the troops above mentioned to support the Swedish officers by all means in their power. I am also to request the Persian Government, as an initial and essential step towards securing the peaceful and friendly attitude of the local chiefs, on which th|* withdrawal of the above-mentioned troops depends, to restrain those mischievous persons in Tehran and in other places in Persia whose inflammatory telegrams were so largely responsible for the attacks on our troops. It is also essential that the Persian Government should induce the clergy of Nejef and Kerbela to recant their recent incitations to the priests and headmen of Pars, and to telegraph to these persons expressing their belief in the desire of Great Britain not to intervene in southern Persia. The clergy should also urge upon the tribal chiefs and headmen the necessity of placating Great Britain by promoting British interests by a friendly attitude to British subjects and commerce. In conclusion, I am to emphasise strongly the necessity of sending the new Governor-General to Shiraz as soon as possible, and of giving him the full support of the Persian Government and supplying him with the necessary money.

THE Persian Minister called at this Office on the 1st instant to say that his Government were much perturbed at the Viceroy of India’s announcement that Sir P. Cox was to negotiate with and subsidise the tribal chiefs in Ears. Such a course would finally destroy the authority of the Central Government at the very moment that they were making a great effort to re-establish it, and they earnestly hoped that it would be abandoned. Mr. Mallet, who received Mirza Mehdi Khan, replied that His Majesty’s Govern ment had never intended to negotiate behind the back of the Persian Government, and that they would of course consult the latter first in any step which they might take.

Following is extract from telegram from acting consul at Shiraz 24th March, and seems to show that there is good chance of tribal migration passing off quietly :— “ Bushire road has been slightly disturbed owing to tension between Kazerunis and Kashgais, and there have been several petty robberies from caravans, and one total robbery of post from Bushire. Governorship of Kazerun has, in deference to Kazerunis’ determined objections to Kashgai Governor, been transferred from Mohammed Ali Khan to Miintesir-ul-Mulk, commander of Malayer regiment. Kashgais are deflecting traffic after Kamarij to Shapur, and thence to Dastarjin via Nandan, leaving out Kazerun altogether. Kawam and merchants have been forced to acquiesce, but Kawam assures me at first detente he will strike for reversion to high road. Ilkhani is at dirreh with Government force, 250 horse and foot and 2 guns and flints and Kashgai riflemen, said to number about 2,000. Kashgai Shishbuluki, Farsimedan, Sefikhani, and Namadi chiefs are with them. Soulet-es-Sultaneh has been hitherto maintaining neutral attitude, but by latest reports from Kazerun he is now expected to come into Tekhani; Soulet-ed-Dowleh has left his family behind, has moved up with one section of Darashoolis, and is about 20 miles distant from ilkhani; other sections of Darashoolis are said to be for ilkhani. Chiefs and Mohammed Kerimi Khan, who are with ilkhani, have been talking for some time of arranging peaceful compromise between two brothers. Chiefs apparently are not keen on shedding blood for any ilkhani, their growing independence rendering ilkhaniship no longer matter of vital importance to them. Talk of peace has not yet assumed any practical shape. Nasr- ed-Dowleh is at Fesa, where Arabs are collecting ; tribes are now all in motion, and should be entering Shiraz Valley in fortnight. Kawam, who has been hitherto main taining excellent order in Shiraz and environs, is anxious, mainly owing to entire lack of money, and for some time has been telling me that, unless Persian Government send him money, he cannot carry on. Is it desirable [s?c] that Persian Government should send Fars Government some money immediately to pay police in town and guards in vicinity of Shiraz ? With money local authorities think they can tide over safely critical moment of tribal passage and prevent incidents.” Acting treasurer-general has promised to remit 30,000 tomans from joint advance to Shiraz for payment police and guards. 1152—513]Iii any further communication on this subject, please quote No. 13555/12 Foreign Office 1 am directed by Secretary ^ir Fdward Frey to state, for the information of the r arquess of 'rewe, that upon the receipt of your letter P.973 of the 20th. ultimo, regarding the scheme prepared by Colonel Hj&amp;lmarson for the organisation of a national gendarmerie in Persia, he requested His Hajesty’s I inister at Teheran in a telegram - of which a copy is enclosed - to furnish his views and those of I is Majesty’s 'onsul General at Bushire on the points raised in that communication. I am at the same time to enclose a copy of ~ir Barclay's answer, from which Lord Crewe will see that °ir P. Cox shares ^ir T1 . Grey’s opinion that it is essential that the whole of the Bushire-°hiraz road should be dealt with from the outset and be both financed and patrolled under °wedish supervision. T e India Office.(13555/12) iR, moreover, of opinion that any Improvement on the Buehire-thlraz road will not necepparlly entail anjf aggravation of the situation on the Kerman-I under £hhas road. 1 is Lordship v^ill further notice that the Swedish Colonel himself had originally intended to include the whole of the Bushire-Chiraz road in his scheme hut abandoned the idea from fear of accentuating the hostility of the Kashgai. r, ir F. Grey thinks, however, that the establishment of one post tv/elve miles to the north of Ghiraz is not likely to diminish their animosity and he would propose,subject to Lord Crewe’s concurrence, to instruct ^ir G-. Barclay to urge the Colonel to revise his scheme by reverting to his original intention of patrolling the whole road from °hiraz to the coast, even if such a course should necessitate the abandonment of the proposed post to the north of that town. In Sir F. Grey’s opinion, it is essential at once to obtain a degree of security for British and Indian trade between Pushire and ^hira-z, and sufficient to deal(13555/12) deal later with the ''hiraz YezdikhaBt and Runder /hhaB- Kerman roads. r ir . Grey would also propose to Instruct c ir G. Barclay to convey a warning to the Persian Government to the effect that if the Phan of Forasjun proves ohstructive to the gendarmerie scheme, it may become necessary for Pis I ajesty’s Government, in view of his had record in the past, to take forcible measures against him.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received March 30, 11-20 a.m.) (No. 222.) 7 Tehran, March 30, 1912, 11 a.m. YOUR telegram No. 216 of 25th March. Cox thinks it essential that the whole of the Bnshire-Shiraz section should he dealt with from the outset, and is convinced that any scheme which left any section of the road to the care of the Persian authorities without being both financed and patrolled under Swedish supervision would be useless, and should not be accepted. He thinks that the idea that improvement on the Bushire—Shiraz section would react on Kerman— Bunder Abbas road is based on misapprehension. It is rather the improvement of the Shiraz-Yezd-i-Kasht section which might conceivably have this effect. Tribes of Fars who raid towards Kerman are from among the five Arab tribes whose activities do not extend south of the Yezd-i-Kasht section. Kashgais do not operate towards Kerman roads. In any case he thinks that the contingencies adumbrated in this connection are quite problematic, though he sees no harm in warning the Persian Government as suggested. Swedish colonel, to whom I have explained our wishes in regard to Shiraz- Bushire section, says that he is quite alive to the advantage of extending the initial part of his scheme to Bushire and not stopping short at Kunar-Takhti. This had been his original idea, but he had been much impressed by the consideration which had been urged upon him that, if he devoted his attention on the Bushire-Ispahan road solely to the Bushire-Shiraz section, the hostility of the Kashgais would be accentuated when they saw that the tribes whose raiding ground is north of Shiraz were not interfered with, and that the prevention of the Kashgai depredations was the first object of the gendarmerie. He says that he can come to no definite decision until the officers now on their way to Shiraz have reported. I am reluctant to interfere further with the Swedish colonel’s discretion without authorisation, and shall not press him further unless instructed. It would, in my opinion, be quite useless to press the Persian Government at this stage to take serious measures to restore order on the Kerman-Bunder Abbas road. Until they obtain a loan, the utmost that we can hope for is that gendarmerie organisation on the limited lines of the Swedish colonel’s scheme should be proceeded with. I should add that Cox has not yet seen Swedish colonel’s scheme, and he says that he can of course not express an opinion as to its prospects of success. He, however, enters a caveat that the scheme has been formulated without any Swedish officer having traversed the road, and also that those parties whose vested interests will be injuriously affected by a successful Swedish-Persian scheme will view that measure with only comparatively less hostility than they would an Anglo-Persian scheme. 1 APR 1912 J _ U r ! 1 '''' [151—1052]CON FIDENT1A1 i - . ^ ■ 1127 S/&gt; Edward Grey to Sir G.

Whilst approving the scheme generally, the Secretary of State for India shares my view that it would be preferable that, if possible, provision should be made at the outset for protection of whole road between Shiraz and Bushire, whereby trade would not be compelled to traverse broad unprotected zone on leaving Bushire. As delay and any avoidable interference with Swedish colonel s discretion are to be deprecated, we are prepared to acquiesce in his proposal if (1) post at Kunar Takhteh patrols as far as Dalaki; and (2) Governor of Bushire is made personally responsible for safety of remainder of road to Bushire, including Borasjun, where there has twice been trouble. India Office fear that the Kerman-Bunder Abbas road, already disturbed, will suffer more as Shiraz road improves, and suggest that Persian Government be pressed to take measures for restoring order on that road too. I fear, however, that this is beyond their resources until the large loan is arranged. Please telegraph your views and those of Sir P. Cox on above points. It you think it advisable please consult Sir P. Cox before making any communica tion to Persian Government.

Sir, ^ Tehran, February 14, 1912. WITH reference to my telegram No. 84 of the 2nd instant, I have the honour to forward herewith the proposed scheme of organisation for the Persian Government gendarmerie; together with an estimate of cost for the first twenty-one months. The estimate for the first twelve months amounts to 55,000Z., and for the succeeding nine months to 70,00(P. The budget only provides for the establishment of permanent posts along the following main roads :— In the north, (a) Enzeli-Kazvin-Tehran-Kum ; (b) Kazvin-Zinjan-Serehend. In the south, Bushire-Shiraz-Yezdikhast. In Ears it is proposed to raise a battalion, 1,500 strong, with head-quarters at Shiraz, for the protection of the Bushire-Shiraz-Yezdikhast road. It is hoped that by the end of the first twelve months posts will have been established from Shiraz as far as Kinartakhte (35 miles south-west of Ivazerun) to the south, and Bagh-i-Khan (12 miles north of Shiraz) to the north. During the succeeding nine months the intention is to extend these posts south ward to Bushire and northward to Yezdikhast. The sums allotted for the gendarmerie in Ears are. approximately, for the first twelve months, 20,700Z. ; for the second period of nine months, 25,000Z.

Our information not to effect that situation near Shiraz is deteriorating, on the contrary Resident at Bushire thinks it is improving. Although Resident reports that season is too far advanced, we think he should be authorised in conjunction with Consul at Shiraz to negotiate, at any rate, with resident headmen of the tribes on road without further delay. We do not consider despatch of troops to Basidu as still essential to preliminaries. Improvement in attitude of Persian Government makes it inopportune at present. There is no reason to think that extension of blockade will irritate tribesmen more than the past, while curtailment of supplies of ammunition will contribute to security. We do not think that payment' of compensation by the Persian Govern ment should relieve them of duty of inflicting punishment on those responsible for attacks, and we are of opinion that continued pressure should be applied to effect such punishment. As regards retention of Consular escorts at Ispahan and Shiraz, we agree with Minister that reductions of Consular guards should be conditional on practical proof of friendly attitude along the road on part of tribal headmen during the near future. The one weak spot in our position is the presence at Ispahan and Shiraz of our cavalry escorts who, under present conditions, would not be able to reach coast without danger of attack. It is clear that they will have to remain where they are until greater security prevails on roads.In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. 1125 1 / 12 . and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. rgsnt.

In the former of these telegrams Sir G. Barclay expresses his concurrence in Sir P. Cox's recommenda tions which in Sir E.

On the contrary, the fact that a German merchant from Shiraz has just pome down to get marned and returns in a few days with his bride indicates that there is little apprehension of imminent danger to foreign community as a whole, and that it is mainly the safety of Smart and the consulate for which special provision has to be contemplated. “I should have thought, especially having regard to the present attitude of the Persian Govei nment, that the present British force at Shiraz would have been strono’ enough to protect the consulate against the type of hostilities likely to be met with” but if Smart thinks differently, and is persuaded that the presence of Indian troops is in itself a menace to his safety, then it would still seem to be possible to withdraw them without great risk by one route or another before tribal migration.

If this action is taken it should be given publicity by every possible means in London, Calcutta, Persia, Mesopotamia.” I invited observations on this passage from the acting consul at Shiraz. Following is his reply, No. 52 :— “ Your telegram No 64. “ Situation at Shiraz has not deteriorated, and I presume the Foreign Office are referring to recent series of robberies on Ispahan road. I have no fear for my personal safety, and I hope that His Majesty’s Government will in considering the situation leave me entirely out of the question, because with or without the presence of troops I can look after myself. Of course the presence of troops greatly increases my difficulties, but the menace to my personal safety is negligible. I do not think that any attack against the troops in their positions around the consulate would succeed even if it were seriously attempted. “The possibility to be considered is danger for His Majesty’s troops in spasmodic hostile assaults on individual sowars or other such incidents for which we could not presumably obtain reparation. Kawam has been taking extraordinary precautions to prevent incidents, but during the migration of the tribes his task will be much more difficult unless he and ilkhani have by then succeeded in securing their position. “ Withdrawal of troops would of course be generally considered as flight after defeat, and Persians, especially the tribesmen, would not take seriously the pronounce ment suggested. Destruction of our influence through withdrawal would put us in a poor position for subsequent negotiations. With regard to our ‘ prestige,’ it is already in a bad way and will be disastrously affected if we remain inactive much longer. Already over two months have passed since attacks on His Majesty’s troops, and I am continually being importuned by astonished Persians enquiring what we were doing in the matter. I have no knowledge of the presumably temporary measures proposed by Cox, but ‘ conciliatory ’ measures would seem, in view of exultation of the natives at 1151-877]2 what they consider their victories over His Majesty’s troops, hardly to meet the case. It would rather seem urgent we should without further delay take steps to exact reparation. Government of India, in their telegram of 5th February, state that our first object should be to call to account those responsible for the attacks on His Majesty’s troops, and only afterwards to subsidise them. Those persons are quitt^ accessible. Lateness of the season would not therefore seem to affect, at anv rate this preliminary essential part of the negotiations, and I am strongly of opinion that it should not be delayed any longer. Knowdedge that we were tubing more than passive interest in prosecution of the offenders would help to obviate incidents by keepino- the tribesmen vaguely apprehensive, and would do something to ease the humiliating situation in which the troops and I have been placed by tbeir dispatch to Shiraz, and our long inaction after they have been twice attacked and, in the eyes of Persian vanity, defeated. With regard to suspension of action until the organisation of the Swedish gendarmerie, this contribution, if the initial difficulties are ever surmounted, may take years to organise effectively.” Acting consul has not been informed of the suggestion in Cox’s telegram of 10th March (see my telegram No. 185 of 12th March) to the Government of India that the reduction of consular guard should be conditional on practical proof of friendly attitude of tribal chiefs and local headmen along the road in the next two months, and his obsei vations regarding loss of prestige obviously do not apply with such weight to this suggestion.CONFIDENTIAL. a l Sir G.

Sir:- Wlth reference to my telegram No. 84 of the 2nd instant I have the honour to forward herewith, the proposed scheme of organization for the Persian Gov ernment Gendarmerie, together with an estimate of cost for the first 21 months. The estimate for the first twelve months amounts to £55,000 and for the succeeding nine months to £70,000. The budget only provides for the establishment of permanent posts along the following main reads:- In the North, (a) Enzeli-Kazvin-Tehran-Kum. (b) Kazvin-Zinjan-Serehend. In the South, Bushire-Shiraz-Yezdikhast. In Pars, it is proposed to raise a battalion, 1500 strong, with head*-quarters at Shiraz, for the protec tion of the Bushire Shiraz-Yezdikhast road. It is hoped that, by the end of the first twelve months, posts will have been established from Shiraz as far as The Right Honourable Sir ^Edward Grey, Bart., M.P. &amp;c ., ac., &amp;c.as Klnartakhte (35 miles south west of Kazerun) to the South, and Bagh i Khan (12 miles north of Shiraz) to the North. During the succeeding nine months, the intention is to extend these posts southwards to Bushire and northward to Yezdikhust. The sums allotted for the gendarmerie in Pars are approximately:- for the first twelve months £20,700. For the second period of nine months, £25,000 Major Petersen, an officer of the Swedish Gen darmerie mission, left Tehran for Shiraz early in February, to commerce the organisation of the Pars battalion.

Following from Cox, No. 202, dated 10th March Situation m 1 ars : —- “ Since the Government of India recommended an attempt to achieve solution by direct negotiation with chiefs as an alternative to evacuation, two precious months have elapsed. Season of migration of tribes from coast district is now imminent, and there is no longer time for this Residency to carry through the series of negotiations contemplated in January. Mean- virile I can but conjecture from the non-receipt of any instructions that His Majesty s Government possibly decided to refrain from any local action of their own in connection with attack on Smart or restoration of order on roads, and proposed to content themselves with such redress as the Persian Government could themselves afford us. “ We are Mill, however, left with the third problem, namely, that of discounting the contingency, apprehended by the Consul at Shiraz, of extensive tribal fighting near that town in spring, by which safety of Consulate and foreigners may become endangered. In this connection the unpleasant experience of the Kashkais in Shiraz last summer seems to me likely to make them chary of renewing close acquaintance with town this season, unless they receive specific provocation, and even if we take no steps ourselves to discount contingency by exerting direct influence on leaders concerned, it is still possible for the Persian Government to do a good deal both to improve the attitude of headmen on the road, and to promote a quiet tribal migration. The specific measures which it appears to me they could take would be as follows : — “ First, to induce clergy of Najaff and extremists of Tehran to telegraph to tribal chiefs on lines already advocated. “ Secondly, to appoint and despatch at once a responsible Governor-General to Fars, not committed by either his past recorder his present patrons to a partisan policy. “ Thirdly, to renew their recent offer to Kawam of a Governorship elsewhere and to insist on his proceeding to take it up. “ Furthermore, if His Majesty’s Government really decide! to take no active measures locally to protect our interests, I strongly recom mend that w r e announce the fact both to House of Commons, the Viceregal Council, and through the Press without further delay, and generally make as much capital out of it as we can. By merely drifting into a climax of inaction we shall lose all the fruits of our forbearance vis-a-vis the Mahometan world, whilst locally suffering an unnecessary loss of prestige. “ I would even go so far as to recommend that in announcing this last manifestation of our friendly forbearance, we declare our readiness to reduce Consular Guard to normal strength, should practical proof of friendly attitude of the tribal chiefs and local headmen along road be forthcoming in the next tw r o months, adding that the first test of such an improvement would be the orderly spring migration of the tribes of Fars. “ Simultaneously with this announcement we might send back to India the detachment of 79th Carnatics now here. (Addressed to the Government of India, and repeated to Minister at [? Tehran].)” I will telegraph my views on receipt of Cox’s reply to my further inquiry. mr P 1900 o. i o PuHt away with xx^.

' * * * * * * * Now about the general situation here in view of recent developments. It is now quite evident that we cannot move small bodies of troops about the country without their ieinir liable to attack. This is at present esp ci dly tne case between here and Bushire, but later, when the tribes move up to the country all round there, we miy confidently expect a similar state «-f affairs to the north as well. I need hardly point out tp you toe extremely precarious position of any small b dy of troops far from support with the inhabitants persist ently hostile. All villages are sufficiently well armed to make their capture by force a Udlieult undertaking, and detacuments moving about are absolutely dependent on villages for supplies at all times and, dur ng the winter months, for accommodati n also. Under these circum stances we become piaetically stationary in Shiraz where we are quite isolated. I have no desire to be alarmist, but in matters such as the state of feeling m the country, I am bound to accept the opinions of the Consular officers, anl if the views expressed to the Minister by both Smart and Knox here are correct, L could not, under present circumstances, get to Bushire with the whole force at my disposal. In other words it would require an expedition to get us out of this. There can, I think, be no do ,bt that our presence here has aroused the hostility of the tribes. It hits them on two of their weakest points, t ieir greed of gain and their overweening vanity. Thev have been accustomed for so long to take toll from everyone who passes along the road that they resent our doing so without paying them, and they object to the presence of the Indian troops whom they affect to look down on as an inferior race. As regards our position in Shiraz itself, it is difficult Jo prophecy. It seems, { however, to be almost a certainty that there will be serious inter tribal troubles in the coining spiing and summer, probably resulting in a state of affairs locally not unlike what took place last summer. The civil authorities here tell me that in that case I must be prepared for an •ttaek by the tribesmen. Personally I should siy that a resolute attack on us was improb able, and though the area to be defended is large and not easily defensible (the place is a maze of walled gardens, all adjoining each other), we could h.-Id out against anything but a Very ^ determin* d attack by greatly suporior numbers. A much greater danger, if there is to be j trouble, is that of having our supp i-s cut off, and i am trying hard to collect and maintain at least a month's reserve. At the best our position will be unpleasant, as with the place ewarming witti truculent armed tribesmen there are bound to be incidents between tnem and our own men. If ) on add to this that the tribes are thoroughly out of hand, and that the Central Government, even if it bad the will, is powerless to do anything, and that t ie local Government is very weak and may at any time be upset by some fresh combination of the tribes, the situation wuuld appear sufficiently pr j cirions. I think though it is quite possible that the Consuls hire (there are two of them just at present) take an unneces.-arily gloomy view of the state «&gt;f affairs, and that the events i have foreshadowed above may be 1 oked on as possible eventualities omy. Tne fact, however, remains t iat, in the present state of feeding, we should find it very difficult lo withdraw from Shiraz if we wanted to, and we can't stay here for ever, that recent events in the north have raise 1 a good deal of anti-foreign feeling which is being fostered by nationalist propaganda down h re and is, I suspect, partly respon sible fur the recent attacks on us, and that no one is sanguine enough to hope for amy improve ment so long as the present regime continues. I think, therefore, that an expedition to open up the Bushirt-Shiraz road is inevitable sooner or later and that ihe sooner it comes the better. For the rest we are sufficiently uncomfortable here. I have been trying bard to erect some sort of cover for men and horses, but continual bad weather, a boycott of labour for some time and, more than all, a lack of material have combined to make the process very slow, and more than half the men are still in tents and the horses in the open. 'Ibis and the hard work we have done has caused an excessive wear and tear of clothing and equipment; our losses in horses, men's kits and also some stores coining up for us during the late fighting have been very heavy, anl this is aggravated by the difficulty in getting things up from Bushire. How I am to refit the squadron at Ispahan is a puzzle I have not yet solved j as tne road from here to there remains practically closed.In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote xo. 9697/12.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 1, 4T5 p.m.) (No. 151.) Tehran, March 1, 1912, 4*40 p.m. YOUR telegram No. 156 of 29th February. Swedish colonel hopes to have his gendarmerie in full working order on the Bushire-Ispahan road twelve months after the arrival at Shiraz of the three Swedish officers wdio are starting from Tehran to-morrow—one Swedish officer is already at Shiraz. In six months after their arrival he hopes to be able to guard half of the road from Bushire to Yezd--i-kasht. He has not yet decided whether this half is to be the portion between Bushire and Shiraz or is to extend somewhat north of Shiraz and stop short at Kazerun. So far as the south is concerned, his scheme, details of which went home by last bag, aims only at guarding the road from Bushire to Yezd-i-kasht, and whatever may be the Swedish officers’ prospect of success in this restricted sphere, it v'ould be rash to count on Persians ever being able to undertake great military effort which would be required to restore order in the south. I shall now present claim for 4,744L (loss of property was under-estimated in my telegram No. 76 by 10L), and press for its payment out of the next loan as distinct from the impending joint advance.

It is proposed to describe briefly, and from the Indian standpoint, the events that have led up in recent years to the present situation in Southern Persia, in regard to which His Majesty’s Govern ment have had under consideration the despatch of troops from India on an extended scale. It is not proposed to do more than refer to the situation created by the presence of a large number of Russian troops in Northern Persia, the distur bances at Tabriz, &amp;c., the incidents in which Mr. Morgan Shuster and Major Stokes took part, or other matters falling primarily under the cognizance of the Foreign Office. The present narrative deals mainly with two subjects, which, however, at times are not readily distinguishable :— (1.) The steps for maintaining, in the interests of British trade and enterprise, security on the roads from the Persian Gulf, particu larly the Bushire-Shiraz-Ispahan road.* ( 2 .) I he manner in which emergencies have been met when danger was apprehended to the lives of British subjects. It should be explained that ordinarily the only British forces available in the country are the small bodies of mounted or unmounted men employed as “ guards ” or “ escorts ” at the British Legation and Consulates, and the forces at Jask and Ghahbar, of which the normal strength, at each place, is 50 rank and hie under an Indian officer. | 2. A starting point is conveniently made from the close of the year 1905, when owing to the need for protecting British residents the suggestion was received in a letter from the Foreign Office, dated 28th December, that consideration should take place “ as to the best means of ensuring that a force should “ be available for despatch to Tehran or any other “ part of Persia with the least possible delay in the “ event of such a measure being rendered necessary “ by disturbances or other causes.” Telegraphic correspondence ensued with the Government of India, to give effect to this proposal, but the year 1906 passed by without any action being necessary, and at the beginning of 1907 it was decided at the instance of the Government of India no longer to hold in special readiness the troops that had been warned. In the course of the correspondence a point was brought out clearly on which the Government of India have often sub- S. 136. Asequently re-affirmed ttieir views, viz., tiie nsk oi sending small parties of troops into tlie intenor of Persia, a risk arising from the physical nature of the country, difficulties of supply and transport, the incitement to the population, and the possibility of regrettable incidents. The decision, they pointed out, whether in any case such risk can “ reasonably be incurred must depend on the political conditions existing at the moment. In the event of these being unfavourable, i.e., pointing to the disturb ances of a serious character, the despatch of a larger force is necessarily required. 3. The disorder that marked the progress of the popular movement in Persia against the Shah’s Government continued to give anxiety and communications passed between the British and Russian Governments for the defence of their respective interests. In February 1907 it was decided by His Majesty’s Government that they would not be drawn into any show of force unless it were absolutely necessary for the protection of foreigners, and that even then they would confine their action for “ physical reasons to the ports.” Later, it became necessary that His Majesty’s ships should be so disposed as to permit of their proceeding to the Gulf at short notice, and proposals were made as a temporary expedient for the despatch of further small bodies of men for employment as consular guards at Shiraz, Ispahan, and Ahwaz. At the end of the year (1907) the Government of India notified the Secretary of State that a scheme had been worked out on paper by which, if military action were necessitated, and on receipt of orders from home, a force could be sent to Persia sufficient for effective action. (It is of interest at the present time to recall the opinion then expressed by the Political Resident, (Major Cox) that advice to British subjects to leave Shiraz for the coast was impracticable and would be ignored. Short of the location of Indian troops at inland centres such as Kerman and Shiraz “ in “ sufficient strength to protect British interests and “ foreigners under all circumstances, until security “ of life and trade w r ere permanently secured,” he could only suggest the increase of existing escorts at all inland consulates to 20 men, coupled with an explanation to Consuls and British subjects who chose to remain inland that they must rely solely on these escorts in case of trouble, and that sudden rescue on emergency could not be expected owing to the difficulty of communication.) 4. Though in 1908 the situation at Shiraz and elsewhere in the south at times gave rise to anxiety, it is unnecessary here to enter upon the events of that year The next year (1909) was how ever marked by much disorder, and on the 10 th April it became necessary to land at Bushire 100 men from His Majesty’s ship Fox to ensure the safety of British and foreign subjects during the dis turbances in which one Syed Myrteza was the central figure.

On the 24th November an attack was made on the Russian Consul-General, M. Passek, when two stages on his way from Shiraz to Bushire, resulting in the death of a Russian Cossack, and the wounding of three of the escort. The Government of India were twice warned about this time to be prepared to despatch troops if called upon to do so. 5. To cope with the situation exemplified by these incidents His Majesty’s Government had in the meantime been considering, in default of action by the Persian Government, proposals for pro viding road-guards on the southern routes, particu larly on that from Bushire. A scheme that had been put forward in 1906 by Mr. Grahame, the Consul at Shiraz, had contemplated the regular payment of the Persian guards who already existed, at least in name, on the Bushire-Shiraz road (178 miles), and their supervision by three detachments, to be posted along the road, each consisting of eight Indian sowars under a non-commissioned officer. Later, in 1909, a scheme was prepared, in co operation with Mr. J. C. Smith, of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, by Mr. J. H. Bill, Indian Civil Service, Acting Consul at Shiraz, in which, while emphasising the view that direct employment of British troops would be preferable, he proposed that 230 telegraph gholams, well armed and well mounted, should be engaged under three European inspectors, and that their duties should be— (1) Constant patrolling of the line and high road in groups of two or four according to circumstances. (2) Escorting caravans under the inspector’s orders in case of anticipated robbery. (3) Collection of information relative to intended raids. The net annual cost to the Persian Government was estimated at 7,062Z., and the guarding of the entire road from Bushire to Ispahan was contem plated (490 miles). 6 . On receiving Mr. Bill’s scheme in a pre liminary form, and before consulting Major Cox, Sir G. Barclay, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran,' expressed some doubt concerning it. He was disposed to think that, “ failing the organisation “ of a force of road-guards under British officers, “ which would certainly be the most effective “ plan, the best—as it would certainly be the most “ expeditious remedy for the present situation, “ would be to interest the tribes in the main- “ tenance of order. Subsidies to the tribal chiefsHfi •! ;■ ■ &gt;! « “ and payment of the tribesmen employed, pro- “ v ided P regularity of payment were ensured, would, “ I think, have most beneficial results • • ■ “ Regularity of payment . ■ could be beat “ secured by entrusting the work of pajnng the “ chiefs and tribesmen employed to the omcers oi “ the Indo-European Telegraph Department. In a later despatch which forwarded Mr. Bill s scheme in a more mature shape, he observed, how ever • “I notice Mr. Bill does not favour the grant “ of subsidies, and, indeed, if the tribes are as free « f rom the control of their chiefs as Mr. Bill “ describes them as being, a system of subsidies “ might prove ineffective.” ^ Finally, after consultation with Major Cox, he recommended that the Bushire-Ispahan road should be patrolled in sections by a force of 600 guards raised locally and superintended and organised by six officers seconded by the Indo-European Telegraph Department; that certain Khans between Bushire and Shiraz should be subsidised ; and that the total cost of the scheme, expected not to exceed 15,0001., should be met by a surtax at the I ersian Oulf ports of 10 per cent, on import and export duties for a given period, c.g., three years. It may fie noted that this scheme avoided the employment previously suggested of the gholams of the Indo-Euiopean Telegraph Department, a feature that had been adversely criticised both by Major Cox and Mr. Kirk, Director-in-Chief, as tending to disturb the amicable relations subsisting between the people of the country and the Telegraph Department. The assent of the Russian Government was obtained to these proposals, but no effect was given to them in view of the fact that negotiations were proceeding for a joint Anglo-Russian loan to the Persian Government of which one of the conditions was to be the formation of an efficient gendarmerie under foreign instructors throughout the whole of Persia. :i: ' 7 . On the 15th April 1910 Mr. Bill was attacked by robbers near Abadeh while on his way north from Shiraz, after relinquishing his acting appointment as Consul, and two Indian sowars accompanying him were killed. Mr. Marling, who soon afterwards became Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, reported that no measure we could take short of occupation of the roads would ensure absolutely against the repetition of such cases, and recommended a pro posal by Major Cox that a squadron of cavalry under British officers should be maintained at Shiraz or divided equally between Shiraz and Ispahan. The proposal was not carried out, but a frank discussion took place with the Persian Government, and they were asked what steps they proposed to take, and what assistance His Majesty’s Government could lend them in bringing about a settlement. The reply of the Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs was that arms and money were the only forms of assistance His Majesty’s Government could give. Sir G.

The situation did not improve, and on the 26th July 1910 the Foreign Office forwarded to this Office a despatch in which Mr. Marling described the condition of the southern roads, and proposed that he should be authorised to inform the Persian Government that “ if by the end of September such a degree of security has not been “ established as to permit ordinary caravan traffic “ to be resumed, His Majesty’s Government will take in hand the duty themselves.” The Foreign Office letter dwelt on the disadvantages of active intervention in Persia and the landing of troops in that country, and outlined a scheme that had been discussed in London with Sir G. Barclay, “ for the “ formation of a force of 1,000 or 1,200 men, analogous to the Cossack brigade, for the pro tection of the roads.” The force was to be levied and officered by 8 or 10 officers of the Indian Army, lent for the purpose by the Govern ment of India. The cost was estimated at about 40,000b a year, of which part could be provided out of a surtax of 10 per cent on goods imported through the ports of the Persian Gulf, and the rest from the revenues of Fars. The India Office con curred in the scheme, it was ascertained that the Russian Government had no objection to it, if it did not extend to points in the Russian sphere, and in the result a Note was addressed to the Persian Government on the 14th October warning them that His Majesty’s Government would take steps for the organisation of the local force under British officers if order on the Bushire-Ispahan road were not restored within three months. Phe text of the Note is printed as an Appendix. Its terms (paragraph 4, end) went somewhat further than had been intended by His Majesty’s Government. Misrepresentation of the British Note.

(English translation.) 9. The British Note, of which distorted versions were published, was widely represented, in this country and abroad, as pointing to a British occu pation of Southern Persia. The Persian Govern ment itself replied to it in a note, dated the 21 st November 1910, wherein they described as the essential causes of the deplorable situation the presence of foreign troops in the country, the recourse of guilty persons to the various legations, and the pecuniary difficulties of the Government as succes sors of a former regime. They recited the difficulties which they had experienced in getting money, and the steps they proposed to take for that purpose, promised to spend the greater part of the money so obtained on the restoration of order, and proposed also themselves to impose a surtax of 10 per cent, on the customs for the annual expenses of a gen darmerie. His Majesty’s Government’s proposal they described as “ contraire a la souverainete du pays et pen confer me aux relations d'amitie et de bonne intelligence gui ont subsiste jiisqu a present “ entre les deux Etats” and they declared that “ jamais et dans aucune cirConstance,” could they agree to it. They further denied that trade had suffered.To this Note Sir G. Barclay replied on the 17th November 1910, under instructions from His Majesty’s Government, traversing the contentions of the Persian Government with regard to trade, and concluding by saying that it was in order that a remedy might be “applied, if possible, by the “ Persian Government, but if necessary, with the “ assistance of British officers lent from the Indian “ Army to the Persian Government,” that His Majesty’s Government had made their proposals. “ It could not,” he added, “ be contended that the “ above measures would constitute any infringe- “ ment of the sovereign rights of Persia, as the “ officers lent from the Indian Army would take “ service under the Persian Government.” On the 26th December 1910 the Persian Government replied to Sir G. Barclay’s Note. They detailed the measures they were taking, including the appointment from abroad of officers for the prompt organisation of the gendarmerie ; they replied to arguments he had used about the statistics of trade ; and repeated their request that the surtax of 10 per cent, might be agreed to. On the 28th December the Persian Foreign Minister resigned, and, in accordance with a suggestion by Sir G. Barclay that His Majesty’s Government might temporise and await develop ments, a Note was addressed to the Persian Government on the 21st January 1911 stating that, in view of the evident determination of the Persian Government to do its utmost to restore order on the southern trade routes, His Majesty’s Govern- meet were disposed to defer pressing their scheme, while reserving the right to insist on the engage ment of British Indian officers at any moment, should they perceive that the measures taken were not likely to suffice for the prompt re-establishment of security.

It may be explained that throughout the period covered by the foregoing narrative there had been addressed to His Majesty’s Government repeated representations from mer chants and public bodies locally and in this country urging that some steps should be taken for the pro tection of British trade and interests. In particular, mention may be made of the letters of the Man chester Chamber of Commerce, dated the 3rd August 1909 enclosing representations from 21 firms, and that of the 28th duly 1910 enclosing representations from 20 bankers, merchants, ship pers, and manufacturers interested in the Persian trade.

At this point mention may be made of a ptojeet which has not as yet materialised, but on which hopes are still based of satisfactory results viz. the organisation of an efficient gendarmerie by the agency of Swedish officers. The intention oi the 1 ersian Government to engage these officers was reported at the end of 1910, and the selection o three of them was announced in the following March These arrived in August, and were fol lowed by seven more at the end of 1911 when blr . ( f ^rclay reported that all ten seemed capable men and should succeed in creating some thing efficient if allowed a free hand, with time and money. It has recently been reported that loin oi them were leaving' for Shiraz. The organisation oi a gendarmerie had previously been contemplated under General Maletta, an ta lan officei m the I ersian service, and it was at one time understood that a sum of about 16,000Z had been earmarked for the purpose. No progress, however, could be made with the project by General lYlaletta, who, moreover, was constantlv ill durino- 1911.

The strengthening of the defences of the Consulates at Ispahan and bhiraz was also considered, but it was decided to take no action. In March 1911 Sir E. Grey tele graphed as to a complaint that had been made by Manchester firms of robberies near Shiraz under the eyes of Persian troops. In May there was serious noting at Ispahan, and prolonged disorder again broke out in the neighbourhood of bfiiraz, arising from feuds between the Kashgais and the Kawam brothers, of whom one was shot near Shiraz on the 6 th May. In reply to an enquiry from Sir E. Grey as to the position of Europeans m that town, Sir G. Barclay agreed with the Acting Consul in deprecating an increase oi the consular guard, adding that, if anything were to occur, it would be before reinforcements could arrive. On the 24th May Sir E. Grey agam telegraphed as to a renewed complaint by Manchester firms, but Sir G. Barclay did not considerthat the moment had come for insisting on the road-guard scheme, and laid stress on the possibility that such insistence might entail on His Majesty s Government the temporary occupation of tii 6 road. On the 10th June Sir G. Barclay reported the entry oi 1 ersian soldiers into the Consulate at Shiraz, and the wounding of an Indian sowar, white, shortly afterwards, the situation throughout the country was rendered desperate by the landing of the ex-Shah at Gumesh Tepe, and the procla^ mation of martial law at Tehran (22nd July).On the 17th August Sir Gr. Barclay recom mended that 22 additional men should be sent to Shiraz to relieve the strain upon the existing guard. The demand was complied with by sending up men from Bushire, and a half-company of the 7th Rajputs (56 rank and hie under a British officer) were despatched from India to take their place and to effect the relief, due at the end of October, of the entire Shiraz escort. It may be added that earlier in this year (1911) a force of over 1,000 men had been landed from India to operate on the Mekran and Shibkuh coasts against the Afghans whose presence for the purposes of the arms traffic the Persian Government had been powerless to prevent. Disorders at Bunder Abbas, too, had necessitated the temporary raising of the Consular guard to 50 men. 13. In September the question of the roads was again forcibly brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Government. A report by the Consul at Kerman as to the insecurity of the road from Bunder Abbas caused enquiry to be addressed by the Foreign Office to Sir G. Barclay as to the possibility of subsidising the local tribesmen, with a view to the roads, or one of them, being kept open pending the establishment of a gendarmerie by the Persian Government. In his reply, dated the 14th September, Sir G. Barclay expressed regret that he could suggest no temporary measure that did not involve in some form the employment of British troops. The best hope, he considered, of early improvement short of the occupation of the roads by our troops lay in a scheme suggested by Colonel Cox for increasing our mounted escorts by the numbers shown below :— Bushire Shiraz - - - Ispahan Bunder Abbas Kerman Bam (with a new Vice-Consulate) 100 200 100 100 100 200 Total 800 Sir (x.

They emphasised, however, the addition to our responsibilities which the scheme would involve remarking that it had hitherto been the policy to confine ^our elloitsto maintaining order in the ports of the Gulf by the action of our ships, and by occa sional temporary disembarkation of sailors or troops for the protection ol British interests and residents m those ports. In a letter to the Foreign Office dated the 16th October 1911, the Secretary of State expressed his concurrence in these views, and his inability to recommend the Council of fndia to sanction any expenditure in connection with the scheme. Inter aha, he dwelt on the probable effect of its adoption upon Moslem opinion in India, and the criticism that it might (‘.all forth from those who advocate a diminution in the military charges of India. 15. Meantime, however, the question of sending- troops from India had entered upon a new phase. In a telegram dated the 27th September, Sir G. Barclay had reported that Lieutenant Wilson had been robbed and roughly handled by Kashgais on Ins wav to Shiraz, and later telegrams represented the situation at that place as one of serious (lan°-er to British subjects. At the instance of the Foreign Office, the Secretary of State instructed the Viceroy that m view of the danger to British subjects effect should be given to a recommendation of Sir G. Barclay and Colonel Cox that 300 sowars should be despatched from India as soon as possible. It should, however, be explained that Sir G. Barclay subsequently pointed out that his recommendation for the despatch of these men was given in the belief that they would be used for the protection of caravans ; he had not believed that a reinforcement was needed if the situation at Shiraz was considered by itself. Discretion was allowed as to a modification of this number within reasonable limits, and on the 4th October the Government of India telegraphed that immediate arrangements were being made for the despatch to Shiraz of a regiment of Indian cavalry with their two Maxims. s. 1 * 6 . « S=3= - 10 The Foreign Office were informed accordingly, in a letter which emphasised the fact that the men would be sent solely for the protection of the life and property of British subjects in Shiraz, and not in pursuance of the wider scheme for escorting caravans. (This was also made clear to the Persian Government in a Note dated the 24th October im.) On the Government of India proposing to defer action, instructions w r ere telegraphed to them to send the troops with the least possible delay, with the substitution, if thought advisable, of infantry for cavalry. It was pointed out that the troops were required for the protection of life and property. In compliance with these instructions, two squadrons of the 39th Central India Horse left India for Bushire on the 20th and 21st October, their disembarkation was completed on the 30th October, and their arrival at Shiraz was reported by Sir G. Barclay on the 14th November. The other two squadrons left India a little after the first detachment, and arrived at Shiraz the 27th November. Later one squadron left Shiraz for Ispahan, and came into conflict with armed tribesmen near Yezdikhast, in which a native officer was wounded. Its arrival at Ispahan was reported in a telegram from Sir G. Barclay, dated the 6th December 1911. 16. To make the genend situation clear, mention may here be made of the action being taken by Russia about this time in the north of Persia. On the 23rd October 1911 the Secretary of State had informed the Government of India that the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs had stated in conversation that he did not think his Government could refrain much longer from occupying the northern provinces, on the ground of disorder, the general chaos, and Mr. Shuster’s attempts to control the administration in a manner incompatible with Russian interests. On the 11th November a Russian ultimatum was presented to the Persian Government asking that apology should be made for the action taken by the Treasury gendarmes in the matter of the property of Shua-es-Sultaneh, the ex-Shah’s brother, which was alleged to be pledged to the Russian Bank, and that the gendarmes in charge of the property should be replaced by Persian cossacks. After some delay the Persian Minister apologised on the 24th November, and the gendarmes were replaced, but meanwhile Russian troops had been landed in the north of Persia, and on the 29th Novem ber a second ultimatum was presented, asking, briefly, for the dismissal of Mr. Shuster and Mr. Lecoffre, a British subject, who had been appointed Treasury Agent at Tabreez ; that foreigners should not be engaged without the previous consent of the Russian and British Legations ; and that Persia should pay the expenses of the Russian military expedition. 0 Letter of India Office to Foreign Office, 9th October 1911.

Barclay tele- giaphed that an English lady, Miss Ross, while trayeilmg with a caravan from Ispahan to Shiraz had been beaten by Kushgeluis near Abadeh. On the 30th October he reported that she had again )een attacked after leaving Abadeh, her money and some clothes being taken. In the middle of December supplies were obtainable for the Indian troops at Shiraz only when recourse to force had been threatened, and this was followed by a more serious incident, when on the 2 1th December, a party going from Shiraz to meet Mr. Smart, about to take up consular duty at that place, were hred on by road-guards from t le hills above Ivotar Dakhtar near Kazerun, with the result that one sowar was killed and one wounded. On the 2(3th December a second attack was made while Major Birdwood was bringing Mr. Smart into Kazerun, resulting in the death of two followers, besides one missing, and the wounding of Mr. omart himself, seven sowars, one hospital assistant, and one follower. In consequence of the serious situation thus created preparation was made to land at Bushire, J 1 ® ce ®? ar 3 r &gt; bluejackets and marines and “ 50 Indian infantry, in addition to the 50 men aJieady at that place. In the result some 209 men of the 79th Carnatic Infantry were put on shore, on t le undeistanding that they were not to advance inland. u ,^ r 1 °.P ose( I . despatch of infantry battalion and battery to Shiraz. di t f o » n as to a punitive expe- Sir G. Barclay’s telegram, No. 757, 28th December 1911. 18. On the 28th December Sir G. Barclay tele graphed his concurrence in the view of Mr. Knox wdio was Acting Consul at Shiraz, that one battalion of infantry and one battery of mountain guns should reach Shiraz via Bunder Abbas and Liimah before the tribes moved on to the roads in March when there would be 1.5,000 armed tribesmen in the Shiraz valley. Otherwise Sir G. Barclay thought no course would be safe but to close the Consulate and let the British residents in Shiraz know that we could not protect them, and that they would remain at bniraz at their own risk. Sir G. Barclay added that for a punitive expe dition and the effective opening up of the Bushire- Shiraz road a properly organised force of four:* d f ■ 12 battalions of infantry and mountain guns would be required. , , On the 30th December Sir G. Barclay repeated a telegram from the Consular Oflicer at Shiraz (Mr. Knox) expressing the view that unless an adequate punitive expedition were shortly des patched Fars would have to be evacuated altogether, and that even evacuation could not be carried out without strong reinforcements by which British subjects might be escorted to the coast. Mr. Knox added that Mr. Smart also agreed in the necessity of a punitive expedition. 19. The Government of India, on being asked their views by the Secretary of State on the pro posal to send a battalion and battery to Shiraz, were averse from that course on the ground of the risks involved. Instead, they recommended the landing at Bushire of a battalion of infantry to hold the town in pledge, the retention of the customs, and a blockade of the coast, which would prevent the tribesmen from obtaining ammunition. They at the same time pointed out that, apart from the question of a punitive expedition, it might become necessary to effect the relief of the detachment of cavalry at Shiraz, for which a force would be required of at least 5.000 men, viz. :— Infantry - - 4 regiments. Cavalry - - - 1 regiment. Mountain batteries - 2. They considered that, if such a force had to be sent, it should bring away with the least possible delay the cavalry detachments at Shiraz and Ispahan, the members of the Consulate, and any British subjects who might be willing to leave. In a leiter to the Foreign Office, dated the 1st January 1912, the India Office agreed as to the inadvisability of sending only a battalion and battery to Shiraz, but, regarding the urgency of relieving Shiraz as the keynote of the situation, commented adversely on the proposals of the Government of India which would entail its postponement, involve the holding of Bushire for a considerable time, and leave open the neutral sphere to the intervention of Russia. The letter put forward the alternative course of immediate occupation in force of Shiraz, with effective control of the road to Bushire, suggesting at the same time that the whole of the cost should be borne by the British Exchequer. 20. On the 5th January, Sir E. Grey informed Sir G. Barclay of the India Office views, and expressed a preference for the despatch of a sufficient force to ensure the safe evacuation of Shiraz, as well as of other places inland, if necessary. He proposed holding at the same time Bushire and Bunder Abbas, and obtaining in the meanwhile an agree ment from Russia not to intervene in the neutral zone. On the same day, Sir G. Barclay repeated a telegram in which Mr. Knox expressed the opinion Sir G. Barclay’s 30th December 1911. telegram No. 772, Views of the Government of India and the India Office.

He (Mr. Knox) computed that there were 50,000 to 00,000 tribesmen m Kars, truculent and free from restraint. 21. Mention may here be made of a Memo randum of the Director of Military Operations, dated 10th January 1912, in which he pointed out the results of abandoning our position in the west of Southern Persia, and stated that to safeguard ohiraz, make good the lines of communications, and carry out such punitive operations as might be found necessary, we should require — Two mixed brigades of infantry, each to include a pioneer regiment. Two Indian cavalry regiments, including the regiment in Persia. 1 wo or more batteries of mountain artillery. One fielo company of sappers and miners. If military action were to be taken for such tempoiary occupation it should be taken promptly. 22. On the 11th January the Government of India again addressed the Secretary of State. They now thought it possible that the situation might be met oy sending a regiment of Native infantrv to Hus hi re and subsidising the tribal chiefs, who would in return keep up guards on a regular roster and on regular pay, while a special Assistant to the Resident, on the analogy of the Political Ofhcer in the Khyber, would be employed to supervise the arrangements. -o On the same day, Sir G. Barclay addressed two telegrams to the Foreign Office. In one he communicated the opinions of Colonel Douglas (commanding the cavalry regiment) and of Mr. Smart, both pointing to stringent measures. In the other he expressed his conviction that no course was open beyond the two alternatives of (1) the occupation of Shiraz and the road, and (2) evacuation On the whole he would have favoured the latter, if so large a force had not been necessary tor the purpose. Q* J tqy II loti UOtcCl bir u. Barclay, m a telegram repeated to India the same day, that such force as would be necessary s ould be sent to carry out evacuation from Shiraz He enquired whether the evacuation of Ispahan and Yezd would also be required, and how Kerman would be affected. On the 17th January Sir E. Grey further explained that we could not hold permanently by force Shiraz and the roads, since a very large force won e required, and we might be committed in eftect to the occupation of Southern Persia. Bushire oi Abbas, or both, could be occupied after the withdrawal from Shiraz, till satisfaction had been obtained and a return to Shiraz were possible In subsequent telegrams Sir G. Barclay ex- piained that, had it not been for the opinion of the Officer Commanding on the military situation, hewould have preferred maintaining things at Shiraz as they were : as it was. he had based his report on the expert opinion of Colonel Douglas that the position at Shiraz was untenable. He also expressed doubt as to the policy of occupying Bushire and Bunder Abbas. On the 22nd January he expressed the view that the evacuation of Yezd or Ispahan would not be necessary, and that Kerman would not be greatly affected by the evacuation of Shiraz. On the 22nd January 1912 Sir G. Barclay further telegraphed that he considered, after consultation with Colonel Douglas, that a force would be re quired of four battalions of infantry (one of pioneers), and one or two mountain batteries, besides at least two battalions of troops for com munications. The troops had best arrive towards the end of March. The squadron at Ispahan might, he thought, be withdrawn by the Bakhtiari road, if their withdrawal was intended. 24. On the 23rd January a long telegram was received from the Government of India in which they strongly urged a reconsideration of the deci sion to withdraw. They remarked that the situation appeared to have eased considerably ; they doubted whether British and foreign firms or institutions at the different centres would be willing to retire, and they were inclined to think that the local officers had over-estimated the seriousness of the position. They thought that hopes might be entertained of some action on the part of the Persian Government, and were increasingly doubtful of leaving in Central Persia a vacuum which might be taken advantage of by others. The force required to effect withdrawal from Shiraz alone would be a war division less one brigade. The alternative course they suggested was negotiations with the tribes for exaction of satis faction and the opening of the road by levies of subsidised tribesmen, to be supervised by the four Swedish officers said to be leaving for Shiraz, in association with British officers ; the elimination or punishment of the Khan of Borasjun ; restriction of import of arms and ammunition for the tribes men ; and the location at Basidu of a regiment of infantry and a battery of mountain artillery. 25. In a letter to the Foreign Office, dated the 25th January, the India Office raised doubt as to the efficacy in present circumstances of a system of subsidies, and drew attention to certain considera tions which, taken together, suggested very great risk of a disaster at Shiraz, if withdrawal were not effected, viz., the irritation of the tribesmen at any retaliatory measures of the Persian Government; the difficulty of holding the subsidised chiefs to their obligations without a backing of force; the possibility that these chiefs would be unable to con trol their own men ; the delay which must take place before the Swedish officers could organise any force.

'We should require each headman concerned— (i) To undertake generally to co-operate with us loyally to provide security for travellers and merchandise on the Bushire-Shiraz route vij Razerun. ^ 7 travell ers ^ T ° + ? akG hl “ s ® lf . res PO n sible, to this end, for a particular section of the road and to maintain thereon a definite number of guards, to be distinguished by a special dress or badge, to be borne on a specific roster and to be given regular pay, which would have to be disbursed in some way admitting of supervision on our part. For instance, payment miffht be made monthly m the presence of the telegraph official or Ghulam in charge of the nearest telegraph post, who would report by telegraph to the Special Assistant to the Resident in charge of the supervision of the arrangements. Q , j iji ) ^0 a b st am absolutely from the levy of * rahdari ” or transit dues, in whatsover form and to sell fodder and supplies at fair prices, which should be adjusted if possible by the Special Assistant in consultation with the headman concerned, according to a quarterly ‘ nirak or price current, for each stage where fodder is supplied. J (iv) To undertake to restore or pay compensation for all merchandise robbed in his section of the road.% J&amp;r 7' J~T' i r v ja&amp; In return for the above undertakings we should guarantee in each case (i) A certain subsidy, payable monthly, quarterly or annually as the recipient may desire, to his appointed agent in Bushire. (ii) Immunity against dispossession or extortion on the part of the Central Government or local Persian officials, except after specific misconduct demonstrated to our satisfaction. (Mr Bill urges, and I agree, that dealing direct with the headmen, and a direcu assurance of immunity from the vagaries of their Government and its venial officials, will be essential). In negotiating terms on the above lines, the difficulties which will confront are (x) Whether we can offer subsidies sufficiently large to induce the headmen to come into the arrangement. (y) The question of the source from which the funds required are to be derived. (z) The best means of discounting the possible misrepresentations of the vernacular press, the priest-hood, and other mischief makers who may seek to show that our proceedings are in themselves an infraction of the sovereignty of Persia. As regards (ar). The elimination of the present Deputy-Governor of Borasjun would, I am convinced, greatly facilitate our dealings with the other headmen. He is the first and most perserveringly rapacious personage on the road. The settlement of his case, however, is a problem of considerable difficulty. As to the amount of the subsidies which we should have to offer, it is difficult to form a precise estimate. The incomes which the headmen concerned make from rahdari and extortion, amount at the most recent computation collectively to £ 20,000 per annum, but Mr. Chick, who has had the most recent opportunities for studying the question on the spot, thinks that we should be able to square the headmen from Bushire to Kumarij for £5,0u0 per annum, and another £ 2,000 should, I think, suffice for the rest of the road where the interests are more petty and easily satisfied or otherwise disposed of. Then the pay of the road guards has to be found, and I think from 250 to 300 would be needed, for which another £3,000 would be needed. On the whole I do not think we should be able to finance the scheme for less than £ 10,000 per annum, under present conditions. (y) Mr. Bill, in making the suggestion to me of reversion to the idea of subsidising the Khans, contemplated payment of the cost of the measure from the Bushire customs : but, under existing conditions, the Bushire customs are already heavily charged and could not stand the extra burden. It would be necessary to revert to the suggestion for a surtax of ten per cent on the duty levied at all the Gulf ports, advocated in the scheme put forward jn November 1909. This was expected to bring in about £15,000 per annum. But to bring in this measure we should htive to have the willing co-operation of the Central Government in all our present proceedings. If they are complacent, well and good ; but if they are likely to be obstructive and to come forward at every turn with the cry that we are interfering with their administration, then it is a question for consideration whether we should not finance the measure ourselves and recover the cost from the next loan to Persia. (z) As to the best means for forestalling or discounting the misrepresentations and hostility of the priest-hood and the vernacular press, I have suggested in a separate note measures calculated to serve that end and would refer to that note. The measures there recommended should, I consider, precede the opening of negotiations between the Bushire Residency and the headmen, and should be allowed to take effect before we move further. I attach a draft for consideration, showing the lines on which 1 would suggest address ing the headmen concerned. The letters to the Kashgai chiefs and to headmen who had nothing to do with the attack on Mr. Smart would be adaptations of it, as necessary. P. Z.

After compliments.t—It is not hidden from you that, notwithstanding that relations of friendship and sympathy exist between the Governments of Great Britain and Persia, unprovoked attacks were made on 24th and 26 th December, respectively, on a Baitish Comul and his escort, while travelling between Buehire and Shiraz, by tribesmen and villagers under your influence and control. The British Government were at first altogether at a loss to understand the reasons or object of this serious act of hostility, resulting as it did in the loss of several Indian sowars of the Consults escort and even in the wounding and narrow escape of the Consul himself.Investigation, however, has elicited the following facts • Firstly, it is pleaded by tW from the Ulema of Nejef and elsewnere, ^ ^ ° { ^'’^‘^ions messages to the pnests, headmen, and peasantry ^Fars filtl “ S “ dln = in '^™atory Government intended sending troops to occnpy SontWn P^' K that the &amp;lt ‘ s k Persians to rise and repel them.

As regards (i) I suggest that we might place before the editors of the English news papers that have the confidence of Government a brief statement of the outrages and robberies wiich British subjects and British commerce have been subjected to on the southern trade-routes during the last two years, and the constant appeals made to us by British merchants and Chambers of Commerce for relief from the slough of despond into which they have been driven. We should demonstrate the obviously pressing need for taking steps to rescue our commerce from gradual extermination if we wish to maintain the political predommance which is dependent on it. Having shown them this side of the shield, which seems by no means familar to the publicists who crit cise British policy towards Persia, we should go on to explain, how, actuated by the unalterable desire to o-iye the Persian Government every possible chance cf rehabilitating itself, and by the determina tion not to be drawn into military operation, if it can be avoided, we propose to offer the tribes a chance of coming into line with us and concerting with ns a scheme for ffivinir a sufficient measure of security to the roads -to begin with, the Bushire-Shiraz road.—— _ ' -t the Agka Khan might similarly be taken into (it) Leading 1 Muhammadans like confidence and asked to co-operate. .r ^ I£ / t , he En &amp; llsh papers could publish something on the foregoing lines —with the authority of Government-^ is possible that the vernacular papers generally m^ht accent tit pronouncement and take their tone from it, but it is doubtful whether a paper ifke the ^Habl W ° ald d ° 6 °- h0Stillty t0 Great Brita “ and HussKaL; the mabstay I suggest, however that it should be possible to influence or put strong pressure on the editor through some indirect channel; the present Consul-Genefaf for Persia in Caicutta, Sir Daood Khan. It appears that the latter frequently appeals to the Government of India informally for the continuance of a patient and longsuffering policy towardThis countiy, and we might well afford him an opportunity of facilitating that policy. We should explain to him tke general lines on which we proposed to proceed, and the tTnnS ^ f ^ t0 ,T ld ^ nt f v l entl0 1 n and t0 Persia yet another respite and go on to point out that one of the chief obstacles which we anticipated to the success of our pacific endeavours was the continued misrepresentation of our intentions and policy by the unscrupulous section of the vernacular Press, in particular, the Habl-ul-Matin. Mirza Gaood should be able to realise that he is hereby given an opportunity of promoting Persian ^^ulEKo bG ^ eithei ’ ^ - P—^ ^ get Another alternative would be to make the same explanation to the Regent and o-et the Persian Government to telegraph to the Editor to the effect that his attitude of hostilitv to us was causing great prejudice to the interests of his Government and that, if he did not alter ins tone, the entry of the paper into Persia would be prohibited and the British Government asked to co-operate in taking steps to make the prohibition effective. Failing his conversion or intimidation by above means I would earnestly recommend that the secretary of State be moved again to agree to the editor's deportation from India. (iv) Analogous efforts should be made to influence, and, if possible, obtain the active co-operation of the Persian Mujtahids of Mesopotamia and Tehran. As regards the former, it would seem from a recent telegram received from the Resident at Baghdad, while continuing to fulminate against Russia's proceedings in the North, their attitude towards Great Britain has become much more friendly, so much so that some are even said to advocate a British occupation of Southern Persia. It should, therefore, be possible at any rate to influence them to neutrality if not to obtain their active co-operation. 1 suggest that we should work them both through the Resident at Baghdad and through the Persian Government, and I venture to attach for consideration rough drafts indicating the lines on which according to my ideas they might be addressed. (v) As a fifth measure I am almost inclined to suggest either that a copy of our communication to the headmen on the road, or (preferably 1 think) a separate short exposi tion of our policy and intentions in Southern Persia, be printed in Persian and issued from the Bushire Residency above my official signature to all persons of influence living within the sphere of and in tonch with the Residency. It may seem a strange proceeding, but the new chapter of pacific and longsuffering policy on which we now propose to embark, is practically in the nature of a forlorn hope : if it fails greater issues will again confront us; so that in my judgment we should leave no step untried in the endeavour to demonstrate our sincerity be} ond misrepresentation, and to give our project every chance. P. Z. Cox, -28-1-12. Suggestions /or a comn\unication to the Persian Mujtahids of Mesopotamia ly the British Resident at Baghdad. In the course of enquiries by the local officers of the British Government in the province of Ears into the circumstances and causes of an attack recently perpetrated by Persian tribes men and peasantry upon a British Consul returning from Europe to his post at Shiraz accom panied by his consular escort of sowars, it has been pleaded by the chiefs of those concerned in the attack that the hostility of the latter to the British officer resulted from inflammatory telegrams received from the clergy, exhorting them to rise and oppose the passage of British soldiers, notwithstanding that these soldiers were not a military expedition but merely the consular escort of the officer referred to. It appears to the Government of India that this hostile attitude towards British policy and British interests on the part of religious leaders who are constantly receiving signs of the friendly and benevolent feelings of the British Government, can only result from a complete and much to be regretted misunderstanding of the policy and intentions of the British Government. For this reason the Resident thinks it desirable to explain to the Ulema, and has the authority of his Government to do so, that it would be entirely opposed to the wishes and policy of Great Britain to undertake military occupation or intervention in South ern Persia, and that they are most anxious to avoid doing so by every expedient in their power. The sole interest of the British Government is to see the restoration of security forr* 3 Britisli subjects and British commerce both in the Gulf Ports and on the trade routes from those ports to the principal towns of the interior. Unfortunately the fact is that for some years past no such secuiity has existed ; on the contrary, British subjects have been repeatedly attacked and British merchandise robbed wholesale, with increasing impunity. The latest and most serious of such outrages has been the attack on Consul Smart near Kazerun above referred to. It is obviously not possible for the British Government or any other Government, however patient, to continue to tolerate such outi-ages from the subjects of a friendly power and in the last attack they would be warranted in taking the most drastic steps to protect their interests. But once again, in order to demonstrate unmistakably the sincerity of their dis inclination to intervene in Persia or*to take action which would increase the difficulties of the Central Government, Great Britain has decided to make yet another attempt to find a pacific solution of the present situation, and satisfaction for the outrage of which a British officer and British subjects have been the victims, and to afford the Persian Govern ment further opportunity of providing adequate security for British lives and commerce on the main arteries of traffic. The success of their endeavours, however, is likely to be marred or defeated if the Ulema continue to excite the priests, headmen, and peasantry of Pars by inflammatory exhortations, and the only result of these can be to force upon the British Government those very measures of intervention which she is most anxious to avoid. The Resident, therefore, urges the Ulema to give their co-operation to the British Government by undoing the harm already done in Pars by their exhortations, and, resting assured of the sincere desire of Great Britain to avoid intervention, to write and telegraph to their correspondents in Pars, adjuring them in their own interests and those of their country, to cease their hostile attitude to British interests, and to co-operate with the officers of the British Government with a view to specific arrangements being come to for the maintenance by the headmen and inhabitants concerned of security on the trade routes, especially on the Bushire-Shiraz route; and also for the prevention of tribal fighting in and around Shiraz. iAiSw r r \l Te&gt;ms of a communication which it is suggested, the Persian Government or Regent, might be induced to telegraph to Mujtahids at Nej^ef and Kerbela. This is to inform you that in the course of our investigations into an attack recently made by tribesmen and inhabitants dwelling near the Bushire-Shiraz road upon the British Consul Smart, while travelling with his consular escort to join his post at Shiraz, the headmen ot the inhabitants concerned plead as their excuse, that the tribesmen and peasantry of Pars had become unruly and committed this outrage owing to the receipt of inflammatory telegrams from the Ulema at Nejef, inciting them to rise and oppose the foreign troops. In the above circumstances we think fit to inform you such action on your part can only become a source of great danger to the Government and the fatherland of Persia by causing incidents of the kind mentioned which the British Government will be unable to tolerate Your proceedings evidently result from a misunderstanding of the attitude of that Govern ment, and we therefore inform you that we have received the most categorical and reneated assurances from its representative that it would be altogether against the wishes and inten tions of Great Britain to intervene in Southern Persia, and they always have been and are most anxious to avo.d doing so by every reasonable means of longsuffering and patience, in order not to embarrass the Government of Persia; but they point out that for a long time past their subjects and merchandise have been subjected constantly to attacks and robberies on he trade routes from the coast to the towns of Shiraz, Ispahan and Kerman; that their patience is becoming exhausted and they cannot tolerate a continuace of such a state of things The last incident of which they complain has been the regrettable attack on Consul Smart to which we haye alluded above, in which the Consul himself was wounded. In order, however, to demonstrate unmistakably its sincere wish to avoid takin-action which would increase the difficulties of the Persian Government, the friendly covfrnment has agreed to continue its patience and to give the misguided inhabitants and headmen concerned an opportunity of affording spontaneous satisfaction to their representatives and to co-operate with a view to maintaining security on the caravan route. We exhort you to help the interests of the fatherland and to communicate by telegraph with the headmen and priests of Pars to the effect that they should for the sake of the country and the Government cease to conduct themselves in a way which can only arouse the anger of the Great British Government and deprive the Government of Persia of their friendship and support; and that they themselves assist the two friendly governments bv showing friendship to British subjects and British interests and take all possible measures '5 the ® afet y of the caravan route from Bushire to Shiraz and for the maintenance of order and tranquillity in and around Shiraz during the coming spring* 11; j —r— — % l ^ 3 11199.

(2.) To induce persons above-mentioned and other headmen exercising control on the road to come to an agreement with us for the maintenance of order on it. (S.) To discount probability apprehended by His Majesty’s Consul at fehiiaz of dangerous tribal fighting in the spring in the neighbour hood of Shiraz. s soon as troops embark from India we would propose to prepare the ground for negotiations by influencing English and vernacular Press and the emas of Mesopotamia. To the former we recommend issuing of a full Pi ess communique both in London and Calcutta briefly summarising outrages and robberies to which British subjects and merchandise have been subjected recently, and then going on to explain lines of fresh attempt we are about to make to hud a solution short of intervention. As regards Ulemas of Mesopotamia we would ask permission to instruct our Resident at Bagdad to make a full communication to them on same lines as the Press communique, and to endeavour to induce them to recant their recent incitations to the priests and headmen of Ears, and to telegraph to same individuals expressing then belief m desire of Great Britain not to intervene in Southern Persia, and urging them to placate her and promote the interest of their own country by friendly attitude to British subjects and commerce, and by co-operation for the maintenance of security on the caravan roads. It is a matter for consideration whether Regent or Persian Government should lie pressed to telegraph in similar sense. In this connection we agree with Minister that we need say nothing at present regarding proposal to subsidise headmen, but it will be pointless to withhold from them the general exposition of our intentions which we communicate to the Press; and, therefore, subject to learning Sir Gr. Barclay’s views, we should recom mend his inducing them to make communication both to clergy of Nejef and Mullahs and extremists of lehran as well as to the headmen on the road and the tribal chiefs, whom we are anxious to deter from fighting in the spring, urging them in the same sense as that set forth above. Simultaneously we would propose that His Majesty’s Consul-General should issue-from Bushire to all the headmen in Ears known to and in touch with the Consulate-General a brief exposition of British intentions and policy in Persia above his signature. The ground being prepared as above, Consul-General would then address headmen concerned in attacks on Smart and those interested in road explaining our intentions and inviting them, if they wish for a peacefulsolution, to meet his representatives at a given rendezvous. The terms of all such communications would he carefully drafted. Before action upon above lines can be taken, however, we need to decide finally as to treatment of case of Khan of Borasjoon. His conduct has been repeatedly unsatisfactory, and we have had on a previous occasion to call upon Persian Government to take notice of it. Before, however, making final recommendations we should wish to have latest information from Bushire and learn Minister’s views. If headmen respond and are ready to meet Consul-General’s representatives, the latter would negotiate on following lines :— We should require each individual, firstly, to undertake to co-operate generally for maintenance of order on road. Secondly, to make himself responsible to us for a particular section ; to supply a certain number of guards of good character on monthly pay to be paid under supervision of our own superintending officers. Thirdly, to pay compensation for all British goods robbed in their section. Fourthly, to abstain absolutely from levying of transit dues, and to sell supplies at fair rates to be arranged in consultation with superintending officer. In return we should guarantee, as long as they fulfil obligations, regular subsidy and the monthly pay of guards, and give headmen assurance in some form of our good offices or support against dispossession or extortion by Persian authorities except after specific misconduct proved to our satisfaction. We are of opinion that it will be advisable, at all events to begin with, for us to find necessary funds in order to avoid complications with Persian Government. Cost, which we should estimate at 10,000h per annum, might ultimately be made a charge on Customs or recovered from loan to Persian Government. Meanwhile we presume His Majesty’s Government will share in the cost.n reply please quote 3.3.10/2152 (M.0.1) r\ put rway SECRE T cx, O I War Office, Whitehall, S.W. 7th Februsry, 1912. The Director of Military Operations presents his compliments to the Under Secretary of State for India, and with reference to the penultimate para.graph of India Office letter to the Foreign Office No.P.232 of the 25th ultimo, would he glad to know whether action has been taken in India to frame proposals for the despatch of a force to Persia in accordance with the instructions contained in Foreign Office telegram No.34 of 16th January, which do not appear to have been cancelled by the later orders in Foreign Office telegram No.55 of the 24th January. He would further be grateful if he could be furnished with any information as to the strength and composition of the force proposed.

The Marqutsj of Crewe is of opinion that these proposals are well calculated to give effect to the policy approved by His Majesty's Government. Their success depends not only on the acceptance by the tribal heady^e^ m&amp;ZL of the offer to be made to them by ix/n the Consul General '&amp;j'' ushire, but on the attitude the Persian Government may take tow arcs the control that under the scheme will be exercised by Bri tish^ am: \ciir 1 # IaaI/I^ 1/L^tUnAC^ jr/' British Officersin the territories concerned.

We aim at achieving three -To get the individual or individuals whom it is decided to hold responsible for the attack upon Smart to settle accounts with Lis. (In this settlement it may or may not prove possible to include payment of cash indemnity, but presumably no specific amount 1 be claimed from Persian Government until the result of negotiations is known.) To induce persons above-mentioned and other headmen exercising control on the road to come to an agreement with us for the maintenance of order on it. (3.) To discount probability apprehended by His Majesty’s Consul at bhnaz of dangerous tribal fighting in the spring in the neighbour hood of Shiraz. ( 1 .) (2.) s soon as troops embark from India we would propose to prepare the ground for negotiations by influencing English and vernacular Press and the Ufemas of Mesopotamia. To the former we recommend issuing of a full less communique both in London and Calcutta briefly summarising outrages and robberies to which British subjects and merchandise have been subjected recently, and then going on to explain lines of fresh attempt we are about to make to hud a solution short of intervention. As regards Ulemas of Mesopotamia we would ask permission to instruct our Resident at Bagdad to make a full communication to them on same lines as the Press communique, and to endeavour to induce them to recant their recent incitations to the priests and headmen of Ears, and to telegraph to same individuals expressino* their belief in desire of Great Britain not to intervene in Southern Persia, anc uiging them to placate her and promote the interest of their own country by friendly attitude to British subjects and commerce, and by co-operation for the maintenance of security on the caravan roads. It is a matter for consideration whether Regent or Persian Government should be pressed to telegraph in similar sense. In this connection we agiee with Minister that we need say nothing at present regarding proposal to subsidise headmen, but it will be pointless to withhold from them the general exposition of our intentions which we communicate to the Press ; and, therefore, subject to learning Sir G. Barclay’s views, we should recom mend his inducing them to make communication both to clergy of Nejef and Mullahs and extremists of Tehran as well as to the headmen on the road and the tribal chiefs, whom we are anxious to deter from fighting in the spring, urging them in the same sense as that set forth above. Simultaneously we would propose that His Majesty’s Consul-General should issue from Bushire to all the headmen in Ears known to and in touch with the Consulate-General a brief exposition of British intentions and policy in Persia above his signature. The ground being prepared as above, Consul-General would then address headmen concerned in attacks on Smart and those interested in road explaining our intentions and inviting them, if they wish for a peacefulsolution, to meet his representatives at a given rendezvous. The terms of all such communications would he carefully drafted. Before action upon above lines can be taken, however, we need to decide finally as to treatment of case of Khan of Borasjoon. His conduct has been repeatedly unsatisfactory, and we have had on a previous occasion to call upon Persian Government to take notice of it. Before, however, making final recommendations we should wish to have latest information from Bushire and learn Minister’s views. If headmen respond and are ready to meet Consul-General’s representatives, the latter would negotiate on following lines : We should require each individual, firstly, to undertake to co-operate generally for maintenance of order on road. Secondly, to make himself responsible to us for a particular section ; to supply a certain number of guards of good character on monthly pay to be paid under supervision of our own superintending officers. Thirdly, to pay compensation for all British o-oods robbed in their section. Fourthly, to abstain absolutely from lev^g of transit dues, and to sell supplies at fair rates to be arranged m consultation with superintending officer. „ n , In return we should guarantee, as long as they fulfil obligations, regular subsidy and the monthly pay of guards, and give headmen assurance m some form of our good offices or support against dispossession or extortion by Persian authorities except after specific misconduct proved to our satisfaction. We are of opinion that it will be advisable, at all events to begm with, for us to find necessary funds in order to avoid complications with 1 ersian Government. Cost, which we should estimate at 10,0001. per annum, might ultimately be made a charge on Customs or recovered from loan to I ersian Government. Meanwhile we presume His Majesty s Government will share in the cost.mmmmmmsmmrnssss .... CONFIDENTIAL. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 2, 11*25 a.m.) (No. 83.) Tehran, February 2, 1912, 11*40 a.m. FOLLOWING from Smart, No. 22 :— “From Government of India telegrams of 11th and 23rd January just received, it appears that schemes involving the gravest issues for British interests in Shiraz consular district have been propounded from Bushire, and, after discussion, decided on. These telegrams contain what appear to me misconceptions of the general situation a_id details of Fars affairs. “No previous information whatever regarding these proposals, or the dati on which they are based, has reached this consulate, in spite of the fact that Shiraz ?Jone is in a position, both politically and geographically, to command a general view oftribal questions and Fars politics. “ In order to avoid divergence of views and information regarding tribal questions and Fars politics, I would suggest that the entire management of the situation should be entrusted to Bushire. “ Under these circumstances I venture to hope that your Excellency will be good enough to call the attention of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the facts of the matter, in order that I may be discharged from any degree of responsibility for further mishaps in far-reaching schemes adopted in my consular district regarding which I am not consulted.” I have replied as follows :— “ I agree that the management of the scheme should be left, as far as possible, to Bushire, but I am sure that I can count upon your loyal co-operation with consulate- general whenever your assistance is required.” [152— 240]I CONFIDENTIAL. /) r Sir G.

GEEARD LOWTHER Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Quarterly Report on the Affairs of Syria. Turco-Italian War. In spite of inflammatory anti-Italian and sometimes anti-Christian articles in the local newspapers, the news of the declaration of war was on the whole received with comparative calm in Syria. In the early part of November, however, the exaggerated reports in the press of Turkish victories caused a general feeling of uneasiness among the Christian population, who feared that, in consequence of these reports, the Moslems might be encouraged to rise against them. At Beirout there was a panic among the Christians, many of whom left the town and fled inland. At Haiffa the situation was serious enough, in the opinion of His Majesty’s consul at Jerusalem, to warrant the dispatch of a British war-ship. Such a step, however, proved unnecessary, as the local authorities in all parts of Syria did everything in their power to allay the apprehensions of the Christian population and generally to maintain order. During the latter part of November reports were received of a concentration at Gaza of Turkish troops, whose object was presumably to attempt to cross through Egypt into Tripoli. Beirout Vilayet. At the end of September Noureddin Bey resigned the post of Vali of Beirout on the grounds of ill-health. His place was temporarily filled by General Hashim Pasha pending the arrival from the Hedjaz of the new vali, Hazim Bey. Damascus Vilayet: Hauran. The Bedouins have in general been less turbulent, though excitement was caused among the Buwela (a very important tribe of Aneyza Bedouins) by the arrest of Sheikh Nouri Shaalan. The latter came to Damascus presumably to continue discussions with Sami Pasha, and was promptly arrested. Engineers have been sent from Constantinople to survey a small branch of the Hedjaz Railway to join Busr-Eski-Sham to Derna, as desired by Sami Pasha. Jerusalem Sanjah. A quarrel has broken out between the Governor of Jerusalem, Djevdet Bey (see last quarterly report), and the military commandant. His Majesty’s consul reports that, whereas the latter is popularly supposed to be far from incorruptible, the former is honest and straightforward and fair towards foreigners. This latter quality, indeed, forms one of the charges brought against him by his enemies. [2328 i—l] BEnclosure 2 in No. 1. Quarterly Report on Affairs of Anatolia, ended December 31, 1911. Smyrna, THE news of the declaration of war was received with the utmost tranquillity, in spite of one or two fanatical attempts to stir up ill-feeling against the Christians The colony of Cretan Moslems at Smyrna, numbering about 10,000, presented the only real cause for alarm. They have been a constant source of trouble, especially since the constitution, and have always been concerned in all acts of violence connected with th6 &lt; Meirs b °Whittal and Co., a British shipping firm, recently suffered at the hands of these men, who kidnapped one of the firm’s employes, an Italian. The culprits were afterwards caught and imprisoned. _ Prize Court. —A prize court was instituted at Smyrna shortly after the cummence- ment of the war. , ^ £ , , Recrudescence of Brigandage.— On the 11th October a well-known % merchant named Christides, in the employ of Messrs. Ballantyne, McNair, and Clifford was carried off at Demirdjih on the Aidin Railway by the notorious Tchakirdjali s band, but ■was released within three weeks on payment of the sum of 1,400 Turkish liras. Shortly after the release of Christides, a rich Turk, Osman Agha, was carried off. Soldiers and gendarmes were sent in pursuit, and, after a skirmish lasting twelve hours, a body, purporting to be that of the famous brigand, was discovered without head or arms. It •was identified by the brigand’s wife, but, though the authorities appear to be satisfied with the identity of the corpse, doubt certainly still exists as to whether he is really dead or not. On the 15th September news was received of the murder of the ex-Eishop ol Anneo’s sister and her' son at their house near Sokia. All the furniture and goods in the house were destroyed. The murders are believed to be the work of some Circassians. n “Fraudulent Shippers.” —As the result of the shipment by the “ Black Band, a firm of fraudulent shippers, of forty-one bales of worthless merchandise to Liverpool, which w T as consequently returned to Smyrna, a protest was lodged by the board of directors of the Smyrna Chamber of Commerce against the manifestly unjust demand for 3,000 piastres gold, put forward by the Customs authorities as demurrage. Proceedings were taken against the band, all the members of which w^ere sentenced to terms of imprisonment. Anti-Greek Boycott. —During the month of November the anti-Greek boycott came definitely to an end. Shipping had suffered most, whilst Greek merchants had been but little affected. Though the boycott undoubtedly fell very severely on certain individuals, it seems fairly evident that Turkish rather than Greek commerce suffered on the whole. Adana. After the departure of Djemal Bey, late Yali of Adana, much persistent talk arose both in Christian and Moslem circles about his alleged malpractices during his tenure of office. The matters which formed the subject of allegations were :— 1. The distribution of the amounts sent from Constantinople for rebuilding after the massacre of 1909. 2. Two building contracts. 3. The sale of Government lands in the mutessariflik of Hamidieh. In these affairs imputations of dishonesty were alleged, and though there are no grounds for believing that Djemal Bey took any part in them, the widespread and persistent feeling that his governorship was nofr above suspicion, necessitate that the charges should he investigated. Panic at Adana.- —Towards the end of November last, such a profound feeling of anxiety manifested itself amongst the Armenians, who feared an attack from the Moslem population, as to induce the acting British vice-consul to apply for the3 protection of a British ship. Upon enquiry here, however, and as no reliable facts could be produced, it was not considered necessary that such a step should be taken. In consequence, however, of constant warnings given by Moslems to their Christian friends, to leave Adana “ before January,” the feeling of unrest became undoubtedly well defined and widespread. Aleppo. The general state of the city and district calls for no special remark. Apart from one serious brawl in the prison beneath the Serai on the 18th August, in which one man was killed and seven badly wounded, there have been no incidents. On the 21st September Mezha Bey, the new vali, succeeded Hussein Kiazim Bey; he has so far shown himself business-like and friendly. ^ The news of the outbreak of the war excited a lively interest for about ten days amongst Turkish officials, but the futility of the struggle from the Turkish point of view has left the population cold and resigned. Erzeroum District. Towards the end of the last quarter a great deal of ill-feeling and discord was caused m Moslem circles m Erzeroum by the publication, m an Armenian newspaper, of an article strongly criticising the present regime, and demanding in scarcely veiled terms an Armenian autonomy. ^ i As a result of this imprudent step, meetings of the supporters _ of the Committee of Union and Progress were held, at which the expediency of “ giving the Armenians another lesson ” was discussed. Thanks, however, to the conciliatory attitude of the vali, moderate councils prevailed. The announcement of the Turco-Italian war at first caused a certain amount of excitement, which developed into a general feeling of depression at the prospect of the loss of Tripoli, which is regarded as certain. _ . i x&gt; Unconfirmed rumours to the effect that Bussia was massing laige numoeis o troops on the frontier led to the belief that an occupation of the pio\ince was contem plated; this prospect, however, was received by the populace with no feeling of aversion or disgust, the official classes, on the contrary were greatly agitated, and declared that the only hope for Turkey lay in a quarrel amongst the European l owers. Opening of New Police School— On the 27th November a new police school was opened at Erzeroum, based on the same lines as the system established some tame ago at Constantinople. The actual number of pupils enrolled so far was thirty. 1 he new school is intended to supply the wants of the vilayets of Erzeroum, Diarbe ir, an, Bitlis, Sivas, and Marmuret-ul-Aziz. Bitlis. Unparalleled disorder and anarchy are reported in the vilayet of Bitlis,_ arising out of the incompetence of the authorities and the lawlessness of the Kurdish chiefs, notably Mussa Bey and the Sheikh of Khirzam. , , Effect of Turko-Italian War.—The Turco-ltahan war seemed to have had a rather quieting effect upon the Kurds, though the feeling of general insecurity prevailed as before, and the authority of the Government remained as weak as ever. Russian Propagandist Campaign. It appears t at umsian progag an is s &amp;ve latelv been making ^reat headway among numbers _ of discontented Hamidieh officers at Melazgerd and Bulanik in the direction of paving the way for a Kussian • ^ ^ i n/r i i in i-Viia a Q't'iT’iki ti o’ oroot ol Itussia s serious anxiety amongst Moslems, who see in this a suikii ^ p intentions.

Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Quarterly Report on Affairs of the Yemen, ended December 31, 1911. IMMEDIATELY after the declaration of war and the appearance in the Bed Sea of Italian ships a holy war was proclaimed by the Imam Yahya and other notables. Great excitement prevailed amongst the tribes of the interior, which mustered in preparation for a descent on the coast. The services of 100,000 Arabs were offered by the Imam Yahya for the war. In consequence of the unfriendly relations between Bin Saoud and the Grand Shereef of Mecca all communications between Najd and Mecca were stopped. Bin Saoud has been levying taxes on the Oteiba tribe, the backbone of the Grand Shereefs authority in the country, hence the order for the looting of all goods bound for Najd or sent thence to Mecca. It has been rumoured that the Grand Shereef contemplated another expedition against Bin Saoud, the success of his former expedition in 1910 being considered very doubtful. Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Report on the Affairs of Mesopotamia for the quarter ended December 31, 1911. Muntafik Arabs. The commission of enquiry sent to the Muntafik country (see last quarterly report) completed its report in October. The commissioners seem to have arrived at the conclusion that the root of the trouble lies in the fact that the arable land on the lower Euphrates is in the hands of a few powerful chiefs and sheikhs, who oppress the Arabs and instigate tribal disturbances for their own ends, and that the Muntafik question is thus merely a land question, which might be solved by “ expropriating ” the present owners and dividing the land in small parcels among the minor sheikhs. It is doubtful, however, whether such a question could be solved in so simple a manner. Bagdad Railway. Four engineers and a doctor arrived in Mosul to complete the survey for the line between Nisibin and Mosul. The work was finished by the end of October. Four other parties of engineers were then at work on the survey of the line between Mosul and Bagdad, 350 kilom. of which remain to be completed. No land has been purchased as yet, openly at all events, for the railway company in Mosul, and no buildings have been begun. Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. are reported to be in negotiation for the purchase, on behalf of the railway company, of a plot of land on the river bank at Bussorah, where a depot can be established for storing material on its way to Bagdad. The Moderate Liberal Club in Bussorah. The club, the formation of which by Seyyid Tahb, deputy for Bussorah, was alluded to in the last quarterly report, was formally opened on the 7th September. The local Union and Progress Club had practically ceased to exist. The published pi ogramme of the new club differs but slightly from that of the Union and Progress, diffeience being that while the latter was organised and controlled by Turkish officials, the former is organised chiefly by local Arab landowners and notables. The Moderate Liberals have also abandoned the policy of Turkification in favour of that of equal treatment for all nationalities. k®yyid Talib, who professes to the Anglophile, has not a good past record, and owes his influence mainly to the position and wealth of his family.5 In Mosul an attempt was also made to foim a branch of the “ Moderate Liberal Club” the chief movers in this enterprise being Daoud Youssethane, the Roman Catholic Chaldean deputy for Mosul, Reshid Etfendi Omarizade and Asuf Effendi, acting kaimakam of Akra and editor of the reactionary ‘‘Nijah ” newspaper. The o+tpmnt failed owing to the apparently unanimous opposition of the army and the influence tactfully everted against it by the vali. Tiari Expedition. The Jelki tribe of Kurds having attacked some Christian shepherds who were beino- escorted by zaptiehs, and having killed seven Christians, wounded two of the escort and carried off the sheep, a small expeditionary force, consisting of the 2 nd battalion of the 105th Regiment, was dispatched from Mosul to the-region of Tiari to punish the offenders. . The expedition returned to Mosul at the beginning of October, having done little more than demonstrate the impotence of the authorities, only a very small number of the sheep having been recovered and the murderers left unpunished. The Shammar Arabs. The Shammar tribe continued to give trouble, and several cases of plundering were reported against them. There is a growing feeling that this tribe, commanding as it does all the roads west of the Tigris, is likely to become more and more turbulent until some step is taken by the authorities to dissipate the impression of weakness conveyed by the fruitless expedition against it undertaken by Nazim Pasha’s orders early in the present year. No signs, however, of any activity on the part of the local authorities were to be observed. J ... x , , ,, Though most of the outrages committed are generally attributed to the bhammars, it is likely^that the real authors are in many instances gangs of Turkomans m league with certain notables of Mosul. Neiv Vali of Bussorah. Hassan Kiza Bey, the new vali, arrived in Bussorah on the 20th September His Majesty’s consul reports that he gives the impression of being a reasonable and enlightened man. Disturbances on the Lower Euphrates and Tigris. His Maiesty’s consul at Bussorah reported in September that a feeling of insecurity and restlessness prevailed m Bussorah owing to the disturbed state of the rivers. In view of this state of affairs, His Majesty s consul suggested that a ^ritis i gun-boat should be sent to patrol the Shat-el-Arab. His Majesty s ship Odm was dispatched, and arrived at Mohammerah about the 20th September to patrol the river between that place and Eao. Thanks to this precaution, no cases of piracy have occurred. Anti-Italian Demonstration at Bussorah. A public meeting was convened for the 27th October to protest against Italian action in Tripoli. The meeting was held outside the town, but was sparsely attended, those present being unarmed. Speeches were made, but aroused no great enthusiasm, and the collection only resulted in the subscription of £ I. 15. Proclamation by Mujtehed of Nejef of Holy War against Russia, England, and Italy. Seyyid Mahomet Kazim Yezdi, Mujtehed pf Nejefl issued a f olTmg beginning of December proclaiming a holy war against Russia, Bngland, a y. “ fetva,” which was said to have been forcibly extorted from e hed by the Kaimakam of Nejef, was exhibited p the sh^^ fro m meddling with were sent into Persia. The mujtehed had hunt • ’Ti 1P politics, and consequently this “fetva” produced all the ,^ “ “o 1 p r ss and kaimakam, who is a prominent member of the ^ i i summoned to was reputed to be of more authority than the Yah of ^ “t he ™ Bagdad and charged with obtaining the “fetva” by force. It seems clear ,hat .as6 guilty.

The issue of this “fetva” was due apparently to a desire to prove that the first was not issued under pressure from the karmakam^iigio^s mov?ment appearg to have failed for t h e present, and the vali is said to have addressed warnings to the mujteheds. Trade Routes from Bagdad into Persia. The trade routes from Bagdad into Persia have been practically closed for the last two months. This state of affairs has caused considerable loss to British merchants, British goods to the value of 250,000Z. being accumulated at Bagdad. Bagdad Demolitions. A cheque for £ T. 5,400 was received on the 30th November from the Sublime Porte in payment of claims of certain British subjects at Bagdad, Kadhimam, and Kerbela for compensation for losses suffered by them through the demolition or expropriation of their properties in those towns (see preceding quarterly reports). The Sublime Porte stated that the case of the claim for compensation by the brothers Abdul Ali, ice manufacturers, on account of the enforced lowering of their prices, was still forming a subject of correspondence with the local authorities.

I approve of proposals of Government of India, and agree that the best possible effect should be given to them without delay in the hope of averting necessity of withdrawing from Shiraz later on. ^4. at &lt; w i jjWj 9596. I. 2174. 500.- 11/1910.o I * I » l Sir, P. 232. (Immediate). India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W., , , 25th January 1912. Vith reference to this Office letter of the 1st January last, I am ; ed to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign airs, copy of further telegrams (dated 11th and 23rd instant) regarding the situation in Southern Persia. Jt will be seen that the Government of India do not consider the necessity 01 relieving Shiraz to be so urgent as to justify the despatch of a large force with a view to carrying out the policy of evacuation-which has been approved b) J lis Majesty s Government with the same data before them. It Will further be seen that the Government of India deprecate the policy ' , ’ lthc b' awa l which they advocated in certain contingencies in their telegram ^ ecem3er - On this head I am to refer to the views expressed in this Ofhce letter of the 1st January. . As rega f ds the alterna tive recommended by the Government of India, it is or consideration whether a scheme of subsidies—which might possibly ave been successful when Sir G, Barclay suggested it in 1909—is now possible, when British troops have been defeated on the road and are virtually prisoners in Shiraz, unless it is preceded by the exaction of reparation so signal as to make clear to all concerned that it is something more than the payment of blackmail. This seems to be also the view of the Government of India, who further distinguish between reparation from the Persian Government and reparation from the tribes, a distinction important, not only because measures that will impress the one will not nececsarily impress the other; but also because (as pointed out by Sir G. Barclay in his telegram Xo. 5o, of the 19th instant) while the Persian Government are generally responsible for the condition of affairs in Southern Persia, and cannot be allowed to evade their responsibility, the particular responsibility for the outrages culminating in the attack on Mr. Smart, rests with the tribes. It seems to follow that the reparation to be exacted from the tribes—as a condition precedent to subsidising them—must be the most signal. But it seems doubtful whether the measure proposed by the Government of India is adequate for this purpose, since it seems doubtful whether the deposition of the Khan, whose headquarters are in the plains 28 miles from Bushire, will have a chastening effect on the tribesmen in the hills. There are four other considerations which the Government of India do not mention :— (1.) The danger of undertaking, or forcing the Persian Government to undertake, retaliatory measures which will certainly irritate the tribesmen, when a small force is locked up in the heart of their territory ex hypolhesi beyond reach of relief. (2.) The difficulty of carrying out such measures, or of holding the chiefs, if subsidized, to their obligations without an adequate backing of force. This backing is expressly excluded from' the The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. S. 136.f 2 Government o£ India’s proposals as regards Bushive, whde as regards Kishm it is for consideration whether the location there of a force too small to operate on the mainland is likely to afford sufficient leverage. , , (3) The possibility that the subsidised chiefs may not be able to c ^ ntr0 ;) their own men, in view of the “ widespread anti-foreign feeling to which the Persian Government referred in their memorandum (see Sir G. Barclay’s telegram No. 2, of the 1st instant), and the inflammatory telegrams from the Muhammadan clergy urging the tribes and inhabitants to rise against foreign invasion which Muhammad Ali pleaded as his excuse (Sir G. Barclay s telegram No. 39, of 13th January). (4.) The high improbability that the four Swedish officers, howevei efficient, and however well supplied with funds by the Persian Government (a very doubtful point), will be able to organise a sufficient force before the movement of the tribes in March, which is the moment when danger is most to be feared. These considerations, taken together, seem to suggest that the Govern ment of India’s proposals involve very great risk of a disaster at Shiiaz if they are regarded as an alternative to the policy of withdrawal. There remains the question of blockading the coast in order to prevent the import of arms and ammunition. Sir E. Grey will doubtless agree with the Government of India and the Naval Commander-in-Chief that this is a measure which must sooner or later be undertaken. But it is to be feared that if it is put in force now the stoppage of supplies may cause the same irritation among the tribesmen there as it did among the Afghans on the Mekran coast and the tribes on the North-West Frontier of India, and may therefore seriously endanger the safety of Shiraz. It is a question, therefore, whether it should not be postponed unless a sufficient force to effect relief, if necessary, is within reach. In this connection it will be remembered that n ' the Viceroy was instructed on the 23rd Copy of telegram encloseq^ ) ^ gir R Q rey . s reqi , esti t0 proceed with the least possible delay to frame proposals for despatch of troops and as to number and composition of a relieving force.

(Repeated to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran.) Foreign Secret. We are consulting Barclay as directed in your telegram of 16tli January, but before any specific action is taken we consider it fk-d necessary to state our opinion, jSinee alternative of evacuation was adumbrated the situation appears to have eased considerably. The serious aspect which reports of attack on Smart then presented has been greatly mitigated by the arrival of party without molestation at Shiraz, and by safe passage and , / treatment accorded to Mr. Chick by a parallel route. The urgency hi— any / v ease—of relief of our military detachment at Shiraz, on which above alternative was based, no longer appears to exist. It could, should need ^ arise, return via Ispahan kbi^ Ahwaz with little risk. Moreover, the recent • information and expressions of view received from Shiraz as to gravity of existing and prospective situation there do not impress us with imminent d - necessity bf. withdrawal of our Coi/nsulate even from Shiraz still less with need for contemplating evacuation of other centres of interest [? intcr-ior-J mentioned. Nor as at present advised do we believe British and foreign firms or institutions represented in those places would regard several local situations as in any way warranting abandonment of their posts and J valuable vested interests and properties. In fact we are inclined to think g our local officers have over estimated seriousness of the present situation at o\ Shiraz, [and also prohafehr-dange^-of developments next spring, and we ^ believe/ danger can very probably be averted by timely negotiation^with tribes ^concerned, and other means which we consider should first be attempted. • i £ r&gt; • Again, if credence can be attached to telegram received Irom rersian Government by their Consul-General here, that Government aie seiiously endeavouring to effect improvement in Shiraz and Shiraz road, and have m some way brought about the arrest of a large number of those concerned m recent attack on our troops. We also learn that four Swedes are actually leaving for Shiraz. If confirmed, these developments would show that we may hope for more effective action from Persian Government under tiegent than formerly, when hampered by Majlis, and that, therefore, situation is less hopeless than anticipated. Secondly, we are becoming increasingly / a doubtful of wisdom of withdrawing our Consulates, as it will U a vacuum m , Central Persia which is likely to be taken advantage of by others to our W detriment, and aspect of our despatching amorce for withdrawal of Consulates, without other British and foreign subjects, might verge on the ludicrous. Our military advisers consider that minimum force required to effect a dignified- withdrawal from Shiraz alone is a war division less one brigac e, and we are afraid that no one will believe that object of sending so arge a force is merely to effect withdrawal of a Consulate. Should ^untoward and |m not improbable incidents lead to further hostilities impeding’ or delaying “ withdrawal, our good faith will be further impugned, and in either case . ^ effect on Mahommedan opinion in India and elsewhere will be L- passage ^ ^ ^ K therefore opinion that question of withdrawal should be reconsidered by His Majesty s Government. . . We recommend, instead, that we should open negotiations with tribes as , suggested in our telegram of 11th January with a view to exactron-of *7 satisfaction Lor those responsi ble for past incident and to opening the road by ^ levies of subsidised headmen. The Swedish officers now reported to be starting for Shiraz might be employed with assistance of British officer/to supervise such levies, thereby associating the 1 ersian Government wit the scheme.11 FOREIGN SECRET TELEGRAMS. Secret Department. k-is. ikl Before however negotiations can commence, it is necessary that present Elian oi Lorasjun should be eliminated or punished. We suggest that the rersian (government be called on at once to depose him formally from his position as Governor of Borasjun, failing which we will be obliged to deal with him ourselves, a proceeding which involves no serious difficulty owing: to his accessibility from coast. A primary essential to future good behaviour and control of tribes is to check the present free import to them of arms and ammunition. To effect this a strict blockade of the Persian littoral on same lines as that of Mekran coast is imperatively necessary. We are already arranging to increase the stringency of this blockade. Wb have still to consider the vindication of our position m regard to recent incidents vis a vis hf Persian Government. Abstention from sending more troops to Shiraz and Shiraz road, or even to Bushire is based largely on desire not to increase difficulties of Persian Government and not to cieate a^ situation from which it would be difficult to withdraw, but it is for consideration whether steps should not be taken to exact from the Persian Government reparation for ^ recent incidents and cost of the measures now proposed. It is for His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran to advise as to amount of pressure it is necessary to exert on the Persian Government with this object. We suggest as a preliminary step in this direction location in our own enclave at Basidu of a regiment of infantry and a battery of Mountain Artillery. Presence of some military force in Gulf is at present desirable for several reasons, more especially in connection with blockade of Tangistan coast against importation of arms. Their presence at Basidu will lend weight to our communications to Persian Government, and if increased pressure be needed it could be conveniently applied by occupation of Kishm positionby same force. We earnestly trusty in view of these reports- policy of withdrawal will for the present be abandoned.Cypher telegram to Sir G. Barclay (Tehran) F.O. Jan. 24, 1912. 1.20. p.m. No. 55.

Knox thinks, in consultation with colonel, that, whether or no punitive measures are contemplated, it will be necessary for the protection of the consulate that at least a battalion of suitable infantry and a batten* of mountain guns should reach Shiraz before tribes move on to the roads in March, when there will be 15,000 armed tribesmen in the Shiraz valley, and general hostilities may be expected. This is independent of the immediate concentration of all available forces at Bushire, which I have authorised acting consul-general at Bushire to effect, but for which he is also asking sanction from India. This latter measure is needed, not for direct co-operation with Bird wood at Kazerun, for acting consul thinks that it would be [group omitted : ? courtjing disaster for so small a force as is available to attempt to fight its way through, but in order, in the event of Douglas being unable to effect a junction with the force at Kazerun, to make a vigorous demonstration on the Bushire side of the passes to draw off assailants in Kazerun valley. The battalion of infantry and the battery of mountain guns would, acting consul thinks, be unopposed if they proceeded to Shiraz from Bunder Abbas or Lingah, as it would be possible to enlist friendly tribesmen in the districts on that route. I concur in above views, and think that unless the battalion and battery can be sent to Shiraz before March there will be no safe course but to close the consulate and to inform British residents in Shiraz that we cannot protect them and that they remain at Shiraz at their own risk. For a punitive expedition and to open up Bushire and Shiraz road effectively a properly organised expedition would be required of four battalions of infantry and mountain guns.

Following is the reply of the acting consul at Shiraz : “ 1 fear that, in my opinion, Smart's telegram in no way lessens the gravity of position. It deals with only two subjects—the commencement of an attack wliieii vas afterwards taken up generally by numbers of armed men from every tower and vi age along 8 miles of road as well as others on the hill-sides, and Persian casualties, mch were undoubtedly small. . , . , , . j • “ A.s regards attack, I would point out that the country m which this occurred is most advantageous to our troops between Bushire plain and Shiraz, and, m ^pite o Z they suffered very severely, and their Maxim, from which at least moral effect might have been expected, was found, when used for first 3 miles of rear-guaid action, more of an encumbrance than a help : We are thus^faced w.th the c.m.dusion that when attack in plain can be so serious it would undoubtedly be fatal m the hrlis^ It is now also certain that in every armed man on or near the road we have a poL t. 1 enemy.

I made this enquiry believing that attack on our escort was the result or inflammatory telegrams from Nejef and extremists in Tehran in consequence ol Russian ultimatum and in the hope that hostile feeling produced by this agitation mioht subside, in which case I thought we might have confined our action to a demand for°a moderate monetary compensation and for punishment of those responsible foi citjtcick Following is substance of their replies :— Douglas savs : “ Recent events have shown that we cannot move small bodies of troops about the country without the possibility of their being attacked This is especially the case on the Bushire road at present, where an attack may be looked upon as almost certain. The same will be the case on the Ispahan road when the tribes move, if it is not so already. We are therefore entirely isolated, and later shall be practically unable to move from Shiraz. I am unable to say what chance there of our being attacked or having our supplies cut off, but there seems a o it. Only sound military solution is to open up Bushire road, and I think an expedition f0rt SmarT P s?yVU‘It e rs Sa generally recognised by Persians here that very serious disorders among Kashgais in the spring are practically inevitable, and it is quite possible that Kawamis tribes maybe drawn into the medley.

I cannot prophesy as to likelihood of attack, but above and the strong feeling of the tribesmen against our troops [?] certainly cannot be ignored • anvhow, the interruption of our supplies by hostile tribal combination wou be effected without The absence of any action on our part after the recent incidents would render such a contingency more likely.

COPY TO N 01A 26 JAN 1912 [SECRETARY’S z I 10 1'^expression of military opinion as to:- (1) The policy to be pursued in vie?; of the present situation in southern Persia; and (2) The military action required to give effect to the policy advocated. 2. It is presumed that the general policy of the British Government under the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 is to respect the integrity and independence of Persia, with due regard to the maintenance of peace and order in certain provinces of that country in which Great Britain and Russia respectively have special interests. It is further understood that, owing to the internal condition of Persia, it was lately found necessary to despatch a Native Cavalry Regiment from India to protect the British Consulate at Shiraz; and that, owing to a recent attack on Mr. Smart and the detachment escorting him to Shiraz, ana also having regard to the attitude of the tribesmen in Southern Persia and the weakness of the Persian Government, military action on our part may now be called for. Bearing in mind that, though Shiraz lies in the 'neutral zone' outside the British sphere of influence, British interests have always predominated there, and that the Persian Government are - and for some time to come may be - incapable of controlling the country or of exacting reparation for the attack on Hr.Smart and his escort, the following alternatives appear to be open to us:- communications open between Shiraz and lushire, or, (b)*&gt; 1 8 3 19 O (b) temporarily to abandon our position in the western part of Southern Persia, by closing: the consulates at Shiraz and elsewhere, and withdrawing them, their escorts, and British subjects (including the officers of the Indo-European Telegraph Department) to the coast. 3. While the maintenance of our position in the west of Southern Persia must involve military difficulties and expenditure in addition, to snich political disadvantages as are inseparable from military intervention, these disadvantages may be outweighed by the political, commercial, and military disadvantages attendant on an abandonment - even of a temporary nature - of our position in that region. The abandonment of our position in the west of Southern Persia:- (1) might mean a serious less of prestige, both in Persia, itself, and the East generally; (2) would entail a loss of trade and trade connection - possibly permanentlyj (3) would give Russia an opportunity and a pretext for the military occupation of the neutral zone of Southern Persia to 'protecV* threatened interests and consulates. She would thus gain in prestige, and to a great extent in trade, what we should lose. She has considerable military forces already in Northern Persia and could quickly seize her opportunity; other (4) might also give/Powers a similar opening, to our detriment; ^ (5) might give Russia an opportunity of obtaining an outlet on the'Persian Gulf which it has hitherto been cur policy to deny her. The attainment of an outlet on the seaboard of S.W.Persia might be of great political and military advantage to Russia hereafter; (6) would result in its being very difficult, if not impossible, for Great Britain to regain her former com mercial position in S t W.Persia, if that part of the country were once domina.ted by another Power. There is understood to be little likelihood of the Russian Government withdrawing its troops from Northern Persia till the country is settled and the Persian Government is itself able to maintain order. Even then it is not impossible that a variety of circumstances, fortuitous or otherwise, mightJ I indefinitely prolong the time deemed necessary by Russia for the retention of her troops in Persia. If, in existing circumstances, Great Britain temporarily abandons her interests in the neutral zone, she would have but little, if any, voice subsequently in putting a limit to the period of the occupation of that region by the troops of other Powers. Nor could she well protest against any measures adopted by such Powers to protect their own interests in Southern Persia, however disadvantageous such action might be to her hereafter. Having once withdrawn, it would be difficult for the British Consulates to be re-established till reparation had been exacted for the late attacks, and order restored in the neutral zone; but it is possible that the Persian Government may not be in a position, or may refuse, to take the necessary action. 4. To maintain our position in South-Western Persia it would seem neoessary:- (a) to ensure the immediate safety of the British Consulates and their escorts, as well as British subjects at Shiraz and elsewhere in the neutral zcne^ (M bo take such action as may safeguard our interests and prestige in the disturbed area, till such time as the Persian Government can itself maintain order. It is stated on the authority of Mr. Acting Consul G.G.Knox that in March there will be some 15,000 armed tribesmen in the neighbourhood of Shirazj while in a later telegram the same officer estimates the number of tribesmen in pars at from 50,000 to 60,000. 5. Pie cent events ha.ve shown the risks attendant upon the employment of small detachments of troops in the present disturbed state of the country. Local Persians are, themselves, of opinion that serious disorders amongst the Kashgais and, possibly, other tribes are practicallypractically inevitable in the spring, whilst the*reports received from our own representatives in Shiraz point to the necessity of our being prepared for a serious outbreak of hostile feeling amongst the tribesmen which, even if it does not vent itself in an actual attack upon our troops, might render their position at Shiraz extremely precarious owing to the ea.se with which com munication with, the coast could be interrupted and supplies cut off. Bearing in mind the nature and strength of the opposition that may possibly have to be encountered, the length of com munications to be maintained (182 miles) in a mountainous country, and the question of supply and transport, it is estimated that a considerable force would be required in the event of its being decided to take military action. It is not yet known how many of the local tribes were concerned in the attack on Mr. Smart’s escort, but from the fact that Major Eirdwood has been able to join hands with Colonel Douglas without^further fighting taking place it may be inferred that there is not as yet any organized tribal revolt. It is not possible to forecast with any accuracy the force that may ultimately be required, but it would seem imprudent to attempt the task of safeguarding Shiraz, making good the Lines of Communication, and carrying out such punitive operations as may be found necessary with a smaller force than:- two mixed, brigades of infantry, each to include a Pioneer battalion; two Indian cavalry regiments, including the one already in Southern Persia; two or more batteries of Mountain artillery; one Field Company of Sappers and Miners; with the necessary administrative services. 6. It would also seem advisable to prevent the import of arms and'''I f * and ammunition into Persia by the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea. 7. Owing to the time necessary for preliminary arrangements and for the despatch and concentration of troops, transport and supplies, the likelihood of the country becoming increasingly disturbed in the spring, and in order to prevent the possibility of another Power forestalling us on the plea that their interests were not being safeguarded, it seems important that, if military a.ction is to be taken at all, it shoulci be taken promptly. 8. Opportunity might perhaps be taken to improve the trade » t routes by military and hired labour and even to train a local gendarmerie force. This would involve considerable expenditure. It might also be possible to carry out investigations in connec tion with railway routes. ■ 9. Finally, it must be understood that from a military stand point the permanent occupation by British or Indian troops of any part of the neutral zone is not recommended. The action now suggested would be of a. purely temporary nature. enera] Staff, War Office, London. 15th January, 1912. sCONFIDENTIAL. WA) Sir G.

Unless the occupation is to be accompanied by a blockade of the coast, it would scarcely affect the real culprits. It would of course bring some stress to hear on the Persian Government, but the latter are only technically responsible for what has occurred, and there is no sign that they are not already doing their utmost towards restoring order on the road four of the Swedish officers are about to start for Shiraz to organise a force. Until we put in our demand for satisfaction for the recent occurrences we shall not know whether an occupation of Bushire will be necessary in order to obtain it.

Sir, . 1 am tllrecte d '-y the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a telegram that has been received from the Government of India regarding the situation created m Southern Persia by the attack on Mr. Vice-Consul Smart, and the measures necessitated thereby. It would seem that matters have now reached a point at which it is impossible to take action in any direction without raising the whole question of British policy in Persia. This is a question primarily for His Majesty’s Government, and it is subject to this consideration that the following remarks are offered. I am first to observe that what appears to be of pressing importance is the situation at Shiraz. Whatever may be done at Bushire in the way of landing troops and seizing the customs, what has to be faced is the probability that before the end of March Shiraz will be surrounded by 15,000 tribesmen in a fighting temper. The immediate objective of our policy must, therefore, be to prevent a contingency that might threaten Shiraz, Ispahan, and lezd with a common disaster. The Government of India are rightly opposed to the despatch to Shiraz of a battalion of infantry and a mountain battery. The policy of sending small bodies of men through highly disturbed country to the danger of which attention has more than once been called by this Office has alread}?' been shown to be futile, and is largely responsible for the present situation. The alternative proposed by the Government of India is to hold Bushire with a battalion until redress has been received from the Persian Govern ment ; to send 5,000 men to Shiraz, in the event of its isolation; and to bring away the detachments already there, the British Consul, and any British subjects who may wish to come. Assuming that the policy of His Majesty’s Government is still to maintain a strong and independent Persia, this proposal has much that at first sight is attractive and that might seem to counterbalance the grave disadvantages that must necessarily attend any withdrawal. But on examination it appears itself to be attended by disadvantages no less grave. In the first place it involves postponing until Shnaz is actually m danger a measure which it will probably take two months to carry out. In the second place, it involves the occupation and partial administration of Bushire for an indefinite time. It would be impossible to send the British Consul back to Shiraz and to evacuate Bushire until the Persian Government had inflicted upon the tribesmen that condign punishment which the Government of India regard as a difficult and dangerous operation for 5,000 men of the Indian Army. The Persian Government, even if they had a free hand, The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. S. 127. Ihave not the means of carrying this out whhm any reasonable time it is impossible to foresee what complications m the north mig t hinder them even in well-meant attempts to do so; and it is mor than possible that they might, as on previous occasions make he presence of foreign troops on Persian soil an excuse for not attempting the tosV while the presence of a single battalion at a town on the coast, even coupled with control of the customs, would afford us a minimum of leverage for moving them to efficient action. Moreover the eventual evacuation of Bushire on any terms short of complete satisfaction from the Persian Govern ment would itself bear the appearance of a defeat. Finally, it must be borne in mind that the question is not between His Majesty s Government and the Persian Government alone. There are at Shiraz, Ispahan, and Yezd consular representatives and subjects of other Powers, including Russia; it is improbable that all of these would elect to withdraw with the Bntis orce , and it is inconceivable that, if Great Britain showed herself nnwillmg or unable to protect them, Russia would fail to do so ; His Majesty s Govern ment would be in no position to protest; and with the appearance of Russian troops in a region which though nominally neutral, has, in fact, been accustomed only to British troops in the past, the whole policy of the Under standing would be very gravely affected. The alternative would appear to be the immediate occupation in force of Shiraz, and the effective control of the road to Bushire. How strongly the Secretary of State for India feels the objections to any such course is sufficiently indicated in this Office letter of 16th October last. But the situation has entirely changed since that date. It is no longer a question of escorting caravans along the roads, but of ensuring the safety of British troops and subjects in Shiraz against overwhelming numbers, and of maintaining the prestige of this country in a sphere in which its influence has hitherto been predominant. With a brigade of infantry and a battery of mountain artillery at Shiraz, together with other troops sufficient to keep open their communications with Bushire, we should presumably be in a position to dictate both to the Persian Government and to the tribes the terms on which we would withdraw, and it would be worth their while not only to secure our withdrawal with the least possible delay, but to take such measures as would ensure that no similar occupation would ever be necessary again. It is not suggested that this course is free from disadvantages. It would not be popular in this country or in India ; it would be very expensive, though the cost of sending 5,000 men to Shiraz must in any case be great; there is the risk that so large a force at Shiraz might find itself drawn into punitive operations which should lie altogether outside its programme ; and it is always possible that, as indicated above in connection with the occupation of Bushire, the Persian Government might profess to regard its presence as a reason for not negotiating at all. As regards the question of cost, I am to say that whichever course is adopted the consent of both Houses of Parliament will be necessary (under 21 &amp; 22 Viet., c. 106, s. 55) before any part of the cost of “ Military operations,” whether at Bushire or Shiraz, can be charged to Indian revenues ; and I am to suggest that in view of the obvious unpopularity of such a charge, and of the consideration that the maintenance of the Understandingi o O with Russia has become a matter of European rather than of purely Asiatic importance, the whole of the cost should be borne by the Imperial exchequer. I am to add for Sir E. Grey’s information that the substance of the above observations have been telegraphed to the Viceroy and to the Marquess of Crewe. The further views they may express will be communicated to you in due course. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, (Sgd.) R. Ritchie.r\ FOREIGN SECRET TELEGRAMS. Secret Department. From Viceroy, 30th December 1911. Foreign Secret. Shiraz incident. The telegrams that have reached the Government of India from Shiraz and Bushire shew that what was foreseen as not unlikely has now happened, and that the detachments of Indian cavalry sent to Shiraz and Ispahan have been attacked by tribesmen with some loss (?) and that a force of 100 cavalry are in a precarious position at Kazerun. It is satisfactory to note that Consul Smart has only been wounded, and appears to be in safety in a caravanserai. Question now arises as to what action is to be taken. First, obvious suggestion is to land a battalion of infantry at Bushire to hold town in pledge until the Persian Government have taken effective measures to inflict condign punishment upon the tribesmen who attacked the British cavalry. The Customs should be seized and retained, and surplus over what is due for the service loans should be kept as a contribution towards claim to be made upon the Persian Government. Disembarkation of infantry would free ship now guarding the port, and would permit a blockade of coast which would create an uncomfortable situation for the tribesmen, and prevent their renewing their supplies of ammunition. This is very essential if measures are to be taken, and we consider that the despatch of a battalion of infantry should be proceeded with at once- Question then arises as to whether any punitive measures should be undertaken against the offending tribes. Government of India consider that measures would be -eventi-mUy difficult and hazardous owing to elusive nature of tribes and to precipitous character of country. Moreover, they could only be undertaken by a large field force with a considerable amount of transport. There is, however, a further contingency which must be foreseen, viz., that even when the detachment at Kazerun has succeeded in returning to Shiraz, it is possible that main force at Shiraz will find itself in an entirely isolated position involving a certain amount of danger. It would then become necessary to relieve the detachment, and to effect this without running new risks a force of at least 5,000 men would be required consisting of four regiments of infantry, one regiment of cavalry, and two mountain batteries. Should the Government of India be reluctantly compelled by force of circumstances, and in pursuit of a policy to which they have from the outset been opposed, to send a force of this size to relieve detachment of cavalry at^Shiraz, they are strongly of opinion that force should return to the coast from.Shiraz with the least possible delay, and should bring away with them the cavalry detachments from Ispahan and Shiraz, members of Consulate, and any British subjects who might desire to avail themselves of British troops as escort to leave Shiraz. Main body of troops could then return to India, and Bushire could be held by a battalion of infantry until satisfactory redress has been received from Persian Government. We are not in favour of sending a regiment of infantry and battery of artillery to Shiraz, since the despatch of this inadequate force would present risks that should be avoided. If, as we have proposed, a battalion of infantry is to be despatched to Bushire, we should be glad of early orders. From Viceroy, 30th December 1911. Foreign Secret. Shiraz incident. My previous telegram of to-day. Senior Naval Officer is proceeding to Bushire with about 200 bluejackets and marines and 250 Native infantry to Jask, with one 7-pounder gun and four maxims. Native infantry will be landed at once, but (?) bluejackets will not be landed without further orders. Instructions have been given that no movement inland is to be made without express orders. This force should be sufficient for immediate protection of Bushire, but is quite inadequate for forcing passage to Shiraz.Cypher tel, to Sir G-. Barclay (Tehran) F.O. Jan. 17, 1912. ^ Q-o No. 38.

It is therefore clear that if, as we understand you to think, the situation at Shiraz is untenable a sufficient force will have to be sent to enable Consul, .guards and foreign residents now there to withdraw to the coast.

This is especially the case on the Bushire road at present, where an attack may be looked upon as almost certain. The same will be the case on the Ispahan road when the tribes move, if it is not so already. We are therefore entirely isolated, and later shall be practically unable to move from Shiraz. I am unable to say what chance there is of our being attacked or having our supplies cut off, but there seems a possibility of it. Only sound military solution is to open up Bushire road, and I think an expedition for this purpose indispensable.” Smart says: “It is generally recognised by Persians here that very serious disorders among Kashgais in the spring are practically inevitable, and it is quite possible that Kawamis tribes may be drawn into the medley. Natural battle-field is the immediate neighbourhood of Shiraz, and the expulsion of foreigners will be a very likely war-cry for one of the parties. I cannot prophesy as to likelihood oi attack, but above and the strong feeling of the tribesmen against our troops J?] certainly cannot be ignored; anyhow, the interruption of our supplies by hostile tribal combination would be effected without -mraoiom The absence of any action on our part after the recent incidents would render such a contingency more likely.” ia renuer such ci cunuugcucv mmo ±n\c±y. ^ (jyvl/yvx^ &lt;!J^ J. &lt;n^\y C/JU Ca : — There is, however, a further contingency which must be foreseen, viz., that even when the detachment at Kazerun has succeeded in returning to Shiraz, it is possible that main force at Shiraz will find itself in an entirely isolated position involving a certain amount of danger.

Foreign Secret. We have received no further information from Minister as to details or responsibility for attack upon Smart and composition of the force concerned. Meanwhile it would appear from papers received by Cox who is here that attack was more than a local ebullition of resentment on the part of discontented road guards and was partly due to appeals from cleigy of Mesopotamia to Chiefs of Fars, referring to Russian action in the north and calling on them to oppose similar action by us in the south. Cox fui ther reports that Chick, who after commercial researches at Shiraz has just returned to Bushire through the winter quarters of the Kashgai ti ibe, was accoided as an officer of the Residency extremely friendly treat ment by tiibal Chiefs. Chick states, however, that owing to attitude towards tribe into which Shiraz Consulate has of late been driven m connection with suppoit ol La warn and vagaries of, Nizam-es-Sultaneh, the tribal Chiefs are convinced that if any British troops enter Fars their first objective will be to ciush Kashgais and that latter will certainly fight in consequence, and could probably put 7,000 or 8,000 well armed men in the field. Having regard to the urgent necessity of avoiding very extensive military operations which might clearly be forced upon us, Cox expresses the view, based on a suggestion from Bill, now in charge at Bushire, that it is still conceivable a solution of the present difficulty might be found by reversion to former idea of entering into direct relations with tribal Chiefs for the preservation of order on the road. We should send a regiments (sic) of Native Infantry to Bushire and then explain to the Chiefs concerned that we have no designs against any of them, that we are extremely anxious to avoid intervention, that we cannot tolerate these outrages, but before resorting to extensive military operations we offer them the opportunity to give us satisfaction for recent outrages and to enter into a direct compact with us for maintenance of security on the road, a matter in which their interests (? are) as much as ours. Suggestion is that Chiefs concerned should be subsidised by us, and in return would keep up guards on a regular roster and regular pay, a special Assistant to the Resident being appointed to supervise arrangements, something on the lines of Political Officer in the Khyber. Neither Cox nor we have had time to think out details and all pros and cons of scheme, but we are of opinion that, yrima facie, proposal offers a possible means of satisfying our interests without extensive military opera tions, and would at the same time demonstrate to the public in India and Southern Persia the bond fides of our desire to do all that is possible to avoid intervention. A further communication will be sent after full examination of scheme.CONFIDENTIAL. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edicard Grey.—[Received January 5, 3 p.m.) (No. 20.) id MY telegram No. 9 fof 2nd January]. Tehran, January 5, 1912, 2 p.m. M f o _ -J Following is the reply of the acti ng consul at Shiraz :— “ 1 fear that, in my opinion, Smart’s telegram in no way lessens the gravity of position. It deals with only two subjects—the commencement of an attack which was afterwards taken up generally by numbers of armed men from every tower and village along 8 miles of road as well as others on the hill-sides, and Persian casualties, which were undoubtedly small. “ As regards attack, I would point out that the country in which this occurred is most advantageous to our troops between Bushire plain and Shiraz, and, in spite of this, they suffered very severely, and their Maxim, from which at least moral effect might have been expected, was found, when used for first 3 miles of rear-guard action, more of an encumbrance than a help. We are thus faced with the conclusion that when attack in plain can be so serious it would undoubtedly be fatal in the hills. It is now also certain that in every armed man on or near the road we have a potential enemy. I am not at present in close enough communication with Douglas to say how his views have matured, but to me it still appears frankly impossible that we shou d again move escort on the road until punitive measures have been taken. “ As it is, in both these affairs and, in a less degree, in that at Aminabad we have come off very noticeably second best, so that it can* hardly be possible now that tribes man realises that he can score off us in this manner that he will stop theie. “ There are, so far as 1 can compute, from 50,000 to 60,000 tribesmen m Fars, whose rapidly increasing truculence and freedom from restraint I have dwelt on strongly in all my fuller reports. These have already acquired experience that European travellers can be attacked on the roads with the same hberty as Persian muleteers, and if they are left under the impression that considerable bodies of Britis troops can be attacked with similar impunity and success I do not think that we need wait for long for result. Y^ou of course know as well as I how entirely impotent the Persian Government is in Fars, and even if local magnates can by fair words get something out of Mohammed Ali Khan, this is likely to be little more than the execution of a couple of scapegoats acceptable to himself, and will not go far towards repairing the t^oYXod-feuds that we have to fear. Had there been any Lth Tn Minister for Foreign Affairs’ 100 killed (and I am at a loss to imagine whence he got his information, since from 26th December to SOthDecember have, I am sure, cied to risk aueJl loss again.” I postpone comment until I have talked with Smart and Douglas by telegraph.

Foreign Office, January 5, 1912, 1*30 p.m. M\ immediately preceding telegram [of 5tli January: Viceroy’s telegram of 29th December]. T to h Following are the views of India Office on the above :— ( Disadvantages attending withdrawal proposed by Lord Hardinge are grave. Firstly, it involves postponing until Shiraz is actually in danger measure which would probably take two months to carry out. Secondly, it involves occupation and partial administration of_ Bushire indefinitely. His Majesty’s consul could not return to Shiraz nor Bushire be evacuated till Persian Government had inflicted on the tribesmen condign punishment, which Government of India admits would be difficult and dangerous for 5,000 men of the Indian army. “ Persian Government have no means of carrying this out at once, and compli cations in the north might defer or hinder them ; to occupy Bushire would afford but little lever, and we could only evacuate Bushire after complete satisfaction, or appear to have been defeated. Finally, the Russians might occupy position hitherto held by Great Britain in region which, though nominally neutral, has in the past been accustomed to only British troops, and whole policy of understanding would be very gravely affected. “Alternative advocated by India Office is immediate occupation in force of Shiraz and effective control of the road to Bushire, in order to ensure the safety of British troops and subjects in Shiraz against overwhelming numbers and of maintaining prestige in a sphere where British influence has been predominant. With a brigade of infantry and a battery of mountain artillery at Shiraz with other troops to keep Bushire road open, presumably His Majesty’s Government could dictate to Persian Government and the tribes our terms for withdrawal, while they on their part would find it worth their while to secure our withdrawal with least possible delay, and to take measures to ensure that no similar occupation would again be necessary.” There are very grave objections to this alternative, and I think that the wisest course would be the immediate dispatch of sufficient force to ensure the safe evacuation of Shiraz, and, if necessary, other places inland, holding Bushire and Bunder Abbas, and obtaining from Russia meanwhile an agreement not to intervene in the neutral zone, but I should be glad to receive your views on the question.

Sir:- Foreign Office 1st. January, 1912. I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward G-rey to transmit to you herewith to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, copy of a telegram from His Majesty’s Minister at Teheran relative to the situation in Southern Persia. It will be seen that in the opinion of His Majesty’s Acuing Consul - in which Sir G. Barclay concurs-it will be necessary for the protection of His Majesty’s Consulate at Shiraz that at least one battalion of infantry and a battery of mountain guns should be despatched to that place before the migration of the tribes in March when some Fifteen thousand armed men may be ready to engage in hostilities, while to undertake any punitive expedition and to keep open the Bushire Shiraz road, a force of four battalions of in fantry and mountain guns would be required. It thus appears that a choice must be made between the policy ie Under Secretary of State, India Office.(52055/11). policy of holding Shiraz in force and keeping open the means of conmunication with the seacoast, which would involve the employment of a very considerable force and evacuating Shiraz and that of withdrawing His Majesty’s Consul and British subjects from Fars. In view of the necessity of arriving at a decision on the subject as soon as possible, I am to request that Sir E. Grey may be furnished with an early expression of Lord Crewe’s views on the subject. A similar letter has been addressed to the Director of Military Operations, I am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,00NF1DENTIAI. « i Sir O. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.-—(Received December 28, 3 p.m.J Tehran, December 28, 1911, 8 a.m. (No. 757.) MY telegram No. 753 [of 27th December]. ^ I ! 0X H S ’ -Y 1 ^-usultatio 11 with colonel, that, whether or no punitive measures are ooutemplated it will be necessary for the protection of the consulate that at least a battalion of suitable infantry and a battery of mountain guns should reach Shiraz before tubes move on to the roads m March, when there will be 15,000 armed tribesmen in the Shiraz valley, and general hostilities may be expected. This is independent of t e immediate concentration of all available forces at Bushire, which I have authorised acting consul-general at Bushire to effect, but for which he is also asking sanction from India, f his latter measure is needed, not for direct co-operation with Birdwood at Nazerun, for acting consul thinks that it would be [group omitted : ? conrt]ing disaster tor so small a force as is available to attempt to fight its way through, but in order, in the event of Douglas being ^ unable to effect a junction with the force at Kazerun, to make a vigorous demonstration on the Bushire side of the passes to draw off assailants m Kazerun valley. The battalion of infantry and the battery of mountain guns would, acting consul thinks, be unopposed if they proceeded to Shiraz from Bunder Abbas or Lingah, as it would be possible to enlist friendly tribesmen in the districts on that route. I concur in above views, and think that unless the battalion and battery can be sent to Shiraz before March there will be no safe course but to close the consulate and to inform British residents in Shiraz that we cannot protect them and that they remain at Shiraz at their own risk. For a punitive expedition and to open up Bushire and Shiraz road effectively a properly organised expedition woidd be required of four battalions of infantry and mountain guns.
