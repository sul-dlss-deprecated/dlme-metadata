Copy of 1o Previous papers :— 1743 1000 3.33 FOR INF^ATION^ ^ ^ „„ 1. This incident^tNoTT in the note of 23rd November last at flag 'G') was dealt with at some length in the minute at P.Z.3602/33. In paragraphs 6 and 7 of his note of 29th July last (P.Z.5219/33) Mr. Mallet asked the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs for information on six points in connexion with the case and demanded that urgent and active steps should be taken to secure the release of the Nakhoda (captain) and the dhow. 2. The Persian reply of 7th December last with Sir R. Hoare’s comments is at P.Z.918/34. It will be seen that the Persians justify the arrest on the ground that the ’’intentional grounding” of the dhow on the Persian shore (the crew say they were taken in midstream) with a cargo of contraband was sufficient proof of an intention/4 ./ intention to smuggle into Persia which (i.e. an intention to smuggle) is an offence under the Persian anti-smuggling laws. The note insists that the Captain and crew were all Persian subjects from Bushire and Bandar Big, but according to the Political Agent, Koweit, the Captain is an Arab and a Koweit subject. It promises that the trial of the Captain will be expedited. Unfortunately statements made after the incident by Iraqi officials, unreliable as these probably are, tend to confirm that the dhow was aground on the Persian side of the Shatt (and therefore in Persian territory). 3. Sir R. Hoare’s later despatch at P.Z.1078/34 encloses a further Persian note saying that Mohammad, son of Hassan 'resident at Koweit and a Persian subject ” (the captain) has confessed^ahohas been sentenced to ohe^ month’s imprisonment and payment of a fine. Sir R. Hoare mentions that he is making a further enquiry of the Persians about the fate of the dhow. The Foreign Office say that they do’ 1 hot think they have had anything further from Tehran on this point but are consulting their papers. It seems worth while pressing the Persians for the return of the dhow though they will quite likely reply that it had been impounded as security for the fine imposed on the Nakhoda.Minute Paper 963R IT I CAL GOMWimS*' i 7 MAR 1934 • (M~ 2119 5000 8.33 Department. 4, This is one of the incidents in connexion with which the Persians have questioned our right to make representations on behalf of the Arab States (see last sentence of Persian note at P.Z.918/34). It has been decided in view of the proposed resumption of Treaty Negotiations to postpone a formal reply to the Persians on this question and that the Minister should deal with the matter orally as explained in the minute at P.Z.498/34 in the attached file. Sir R. Hoare has not yet had an opportunity to do this since the new Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs is still studying the papers about the Treaty negotiations as a preliminary to their resumption. It is possible that the words in the last Persian note ’’resident at Koweit and a Persian subject' are meant to imply that all Koweitis are Persians, but if the Treaty negotiations are to be resumed it will perhaps be best not to pursue this nationality point any further at present. 5. The position is extremely unsatisfactory, but in the circumstances there does not seem to be any further action which can usefully be taken at present except perhaps as suggested in paragraph 3 above. -rU ^ If vf*\ Ifisi+j J-* uk* L t, rj.

Y i i ’ ho. 583. (1). See also (8). I attach a translation of the relevant article of the Law of Manhfc 7th, 1929, concerning smuggling, and of Article lo9 of the Customs Regulations. neither of these articles, however, throw any li^at on what would be held to constitute proof of an intention to commit the offese of smuggling. in this case the Persian Government apparently hold (see point (2) in the Persian Bote) that the fact that the dhow was aground on the Persian bank with a prohibited cargo is proof that the cargo was about to be smuggled into Persia, or was in the prooess of being so smuggled. But it is always? possible (though admittedly improbable) that the crew of a dhow found in such circumstances mijgtt have had the intention of proceeding later to a Persian Customs post, where the importation of the piirtieular oar go which they happened to be carrying fhe Right Honourable Sir John Simon a.C.S.I., •to., etc., etc., the Foreign Office. was-2 was permitt«(i. (£)• fh« contention of the crew is that the dhow was neTer taken anywhere near the Arslan shore and that they were eaptured by a Persian Customs launch while in midstream* 2he contention of the jeeraian authorities has throughout been that the dhow was disoovored aground on the Persian bank* fhe latter hare not, However, previously contended that the orew admitted at the time having run the dhow aground on the Persian bank with the express intention of ultimately evading the 'Ira^i Customs patrols* $o judge by declaration® made subsequent to the arrest by the ^raqtl Director of Customs at F&amp;o and the 'Iraqi Vice-Consul at Mohaamerah, it would not be difficult to convince the ’Iraqi authorities that this admission was no sore than the literal truth* (3) . The amission made with regard to the *i letter to the consignor’s agent in F&amp;o (jabran bin Khallfeh al-Jabr&amp;a) renders the question of whether any documents were really destroyed comparatively uni iportuat. The Persian Governae it would doubt let i scout any suggestion that the existence of such a letter proved the bona tides of the dhow by pointing to point (7) in their note* (4) . The facts are probably that the sailors wore not actually imprisoned: they were simply told they must not go away: during that period it did not oeour to the Persian antherities to provide th*a with any food* and finally the Bailor* OSC&amp;pcg«aoap#4 Hjp night to tho ira^i shore (o), The nationality of the eailora is of no * i portanoe. As regards the Captain’s nationality t the .Persian Government should preaumably be asked to state the grounds on which he is claimed by them to be a Persian subject. Incidentally, in Mr •Mallet’s note So. 393 of July J29th (see Tehran despatch Ho. 3T9 of * July 29th) the nationality of the owner of the dhow and cargo was not mentioned, as It was evident that he could probably be claimed as a Persian subject under the Nationality Law of 1939* The information from Kuwait (see 3ushire despatch Ho. 574 - s/30 B of May &amp;0th,1935) is to the effect that his ancestors came from Persia to Kuwait many years ago. In case the question arises it mi^frt be useful if I could be informed where the owner and his father were bora and when hie tastily came to Kuwait. {*}. Considering that the Captain has been in prison for twelve months, the action of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs is scarcely premature. (7) This may be a reasonable and even Inherently probable theory, but it does not take the place of legal proof in any particular instance. (8) * See (1) above. 3 3.

Mo. S56866 Dated Asar 16th 1312 December 7th,1933. Ilonsieur le Ministre, Csie of the matters raised in Mr .Mallet 9 a $ote Ho. 480 of J£ehr 1st (September 23rd 1933) to which a reply was requested was the subject of the Hote Ho. 395 whiuh f after enquiry was found to mean Hote Ho. 393, presumably quoted as 395 by mistake. The note dated urdad 7th (July 29th 1933) Ho. 393 refers to the complaint made regarding the arrest of the dhow belonging to a certain H&amp;ji ohaimiiad Hussein who was mentioned in the Hot# as being a Kuwaiti. The contents of the note in question were again communicated to the concerned quarters for necessary investigations. A reply has now been received of which I append a summary ior four ^eellenoy 9 s information :• I. In the law regarding the punishment of smugglers passed on jgsfand 16th 1307 (March 7th 1929) the offence of p commencement of smuggling has been provided for and a punish ment which is leas than that provided for committing (the actual) crirae has been assigned to it. In view of the prohibition of the importation of sugar and. tea through the ports of Bahstanahlr and Ohusbeh. even aup.jobin,., that thar# may be no evilenoe^the commencement of smuggling on the part of the Captain of the sailing boat and o^ing «,hat the statements made by the sailors to the effect ** ** po ®f ibly 'Preliminary step* shewing an intent to s»a&amp;Sle' (translator).that with a Yiaw to avoiding any inspection of the Iraqi customs motor boat at Fao their boat was grounded on the Persian shore were accurate, this very act, namely the intent ional grounding of the sailing boat, which was carrying sugar, on the shore of Bahmanshir and Ghusbeh, can be considered as proof adequate to justify the confiscation of the cargo trans ported by that boat. 3. Hone of the documents relating to the boat has been destroyed but in the w proe es-verbal rt which was drawn up at the time of the inspection of the Kuwaiti dhow it was mentioned that a letter was found in the sailing boat addressed to one Khalifeh Jiran residing in Fao regarding forty bags of sugar. 4. Ho ill-treatment of the ssl lore took place. 5. fhe Captain ana sailors of the Kuwaiti dhow in question were all Persian subjects and residents of gushire and Bandar ’ ig. Only one of them, named Mohammad Faloo, produced an Iraqi passport, but he was also a Persian subject residing at Falahieh who, following a theft which he had committed sometime ago in Ghusbeh, had fled to Iraq territory. 6. Hecessary steps have been taken through the .Aixiistry of Justice with a view to expediting the examination of the case and the trial of the Captain. 7.

Under Secretary Secretary of State... ^bpy of to SEEN POLSTICAL CGi«&lt;iViiTTEB) Previous Papers - FOR INFORMATION, Moat of the somewhat voluminous correspondence in connexion with this case was enclosed with the Political Resident’s despatch of 12th May (P.Z.3279) and cross references to the various papers have mostly been noted in the margin. It will be seen that there was a good deal of confusion regarding (l) the names and nationality of the owner, nakhoda and crew of the dhow and of the exporter of the cargo and ( 2 ) the exact spot where the incident occurred. ( 1 ) has now been definitely cleared up by the Political Agent’s letter at P.Z.3602 but (2) * * is still a matter of some uncertainty. With regard to (l), the boat at the time of the * • incident was still registered in the name of Mohamed Hussain who recently died, and the 3997 b 2000 10.29 exporter/11 ' ■■ ■■ *- exporter of the cargo and present owner of the boat are one and the same man, Yusuf bin Mohamed Hussain, a Koweiti subject but of Persian descent. The Nakhoda Mohamed Hassan (or bin Hassan) is a Koweiti Arab, one of the crew a Koweiti Arab, and the two remaining members of the crew Iraqis. With regard to the place where the dhow was seized, the Koweit account based on the statements (Flag S) of the ’Iraqi sailors is that the dhow was anchored near the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab below Fao for which it was making and on the Iraq side of the river (or in midstream - the frontier follows the left bank). The statement (pp.4-5 of P.Z.3279) that the dhow was opposite Gusba may be a mistake or there may be two places of that name. The Persian account that the dhow was confiscated in 'Persian territorial waters between K I Qassabeh (Gusba) and the Bahmanshir' (exact place not mentioned) does not necessarily conflict in essentials with the Koweiti account since the Persians lay claim to the thalweg of the Shatt as the frontier (see Note from . Persian M.F.A. - flag X) unless the contention of the Persian Customs that the boat was aground (i.e. on the Persian side of the river) is correct since then it would have been admittedly in Persian territory. It will be seen that information, such as it is, from ’Iraqi sources tends to confirm the Persian version (p.20 and 28 of P.Z.3279 w upstream from Fao. ). Wherever the incident happened it is clear that the Persians seized/Minute Paper. Department. , r ^T~'*Ob(o i ‘ W 7 J - seized the dhow and towed it to Gusba and imprisoned the Nakhoda and crew. The crew were released after ten days during which they apparently were given no food, subsisting on their cargo of sugar, and the Nakhoda is still in prison on a charge of smuggling, the dhow being also detained. The dhow was carrying cargo properly manifested for Fao; the manifest is said to have been destroyed by the Persian customs officials but a duplicate copy has been produced by the Koweit Custans (p.7). There is a possibility nevertheless that the dhow may have intended to smuggle goods into Persia and the Iraqi and British consuls (on the strength of information from unofficial sources) are agreed as to this possibility (p.ll of P.Z.3279). On the other hand even if the dhow was in Persian territory and this is extremely doubtful, the Persian customs authorities acted in an outrageously high-handed manner in seizing the dhow merely on suspicion. There is a danger that unless something can be done about it, incidents such as these may become more frequent especially since the arrival of the new Persian Navy in the Gulf. Papers regarding the seizure of another Koweit dhow by the Persians off Henjam, apparently outside territorial waters, are separately submitted. /V We have not heard of any further action having been taken at Tehran vis-a-vis the Persian Government in the Shatt-al-Arab case since our Ministers note of 3 rd February (p.17 of P.Z.3279) to which the Persian M.F.a. replied on 4th March (Flag X), but presumably something further will be done now that it is definitely established that the arrested Nakhoda is a Koweit Arab and not a Persian/POMES' Persian as the Persian authorities declared. Mr.Rendel’s letter of 27th April to the Minister at Tehran assumed that the Hakhoda was a Persian (P.Z.2431/33). Unfortunately some of the India Office papers dealing with the case have gone astray. The Foreign Office have supplied most of our deficiencies (P. Z. hut our official letter asking for a report from Bushire in response to which the Political Resident sent us the dossier at P.Z.3279 is still missing.

Seizure of Kuwait dhow and cargo in the Shatt al Arab hy the Persian customs authorities. Sir, I have the honour to forward translation of a letter, No.2/774-B, dated the 22nd Shahan 1351 (21st December 1932) which I have today received from His Excellency the Buler of Kuwait, together with a duplicate copy of manifest No.373 dated the 6th December 1932(7th Shaban 1351) issued by the Kuwait Customs Department to the Naukhadar of the Dhow referred to in His Excellency’s letter. 2. The letter and manifest speak for themselves . 3. The owner of the cargo one Yusuf bin Mohomed Hussain Behbehani who is a subject of Kuwait though of Persian origin personally brought the Shaikh’s letter, ard gave the following version of the affair. This I have no reason to doubt is a fairly truthful account of the incident and is as follows: H The dhow containing the goods left Kuwait on rt 6th December 1932. It entered the river and rt attemuted to make the town of Fao, its ’•destination, but was obliged by a strong North rt wind to anchor in mid-stream. This took place '•opposite the Persian village of Gusba . In ’•the afternoon of the same day a Persian River 'Police boat (ballam) appeared, and four armed men/5 -2 'armed men boarded the dhow* These, injspite 'of the fact that the Naukhadar (Captain) 'produced his manifest and assured them that his 'ship was hound for Fao, on the Iraq side of the ^ 'river, tore up the document (manifest), seized 'the boat, and towed it to G-usba. Here the 'captain and crew were arrested and taken before 'the Eais El Nazmiyah* Later the crew were 'released and told to remain at G-usba pending 'the trial of the Naukhadar for contraband 'running. They however managed to escape by 'night to the Iraq side of the river, and there 'lodged complaint with the consignor’s agent at 'Fao. The latter sent one of the crew to Kuwait 'to report the matter, and gave him a note to ' Yusuf bin Mohomed Behbehani, translation of 'which is not enclosed. The Agent it seems also 'proceeded to Basrah not knowing the ropes and 'reported the matter to the Mutasarrif there. 'The Naukhadar in the meantime lies in prison 'at Gusba or Mohammerah( it is not know which) 'while the dhow is detained by the Persian 'Customs authorities'. 4. I am sending a copy of this letter with enclosures to His Majesty's Vice Consul at Mohammerah direct, and am requesting him to approach the Persian authorities with a view to getting the dhow released at acHjc an early date. No doubt he will communicate direct with you, if he is not successful, in which case I trust you will be able to see your way to refer the matter to His Majesty's Minister in Tehran, as to my mind the case is rather a serious one.

The point is that there is a Customs post allocated to this place and a Customs launch patrols from here to Bamashir river. It was on * this patrolling (exact uncer ^* n ) tint dhow was caught and towed to Gusba. It is moreover well-known by both Iraq, and Persian Customs authorities that on payment of a very small sum - would-be smugglers are able to purchase 2 manifests. Should they be caught by Persian authorities they show a manifest for Iraq give reasons (for former papers) as adverse weather. Should they be caught by Iraq authorities they show a manifest for Persia. This is maintained to be position in this case.

Karoh 2nd, 1933• Dear Consulate, Our despatch No*5 of February 3rd enclosing a copy of a note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the arrest of a Kuwait dhow in the Shatt-al-Arab while on its way to Fao. Will you please ask Mohammerah for copies of their telegrams Nos.4 and 5 to the Legation and any other papers necessary to complete the story of the proceedings. We are still somewhat puzzled as to where the Persian authorities maintain that the dhow was at the time of its capture. If it was really and truly in the Bahmanshir river, then it was indisputably in Persian territorial waters (or to be more exact in Persian national waters): even if it was somewhere off the mouth of the Bahmanshir it was probably in Persian territorial waters. Squally if it was aground somewhere in the Shatt-al-Arab it would in the nature of things be 'above low water mark' and so in Persian territorial waters. So far so good. What puzzles us is the mention of G-usba. Gusba (presumably the same as Kasha on the Admiralty Charts) is upstream from Fao and if a dhow with a cargo manifested for Fao were found in the vicinity it would doubtless afford strong grounds for presuming that it was there for some ulterior purpose (though that would not justify the Persians in interfering with it outside the narrow strip of water along their own shore which lies between that shore and the low water lin^) His Majesty^ Consulate, Ahwa z• The/— - 2 - ' Tw' ^ ,KTa The real difficulty is the phrase “between Gusba and the Bahmanshir in Persian territorial waters”. The area in question covers the whole of the Shatt-al-Arab from Gusba to the sea and except for the strip mentioned above, which is probably never more than a few feet wide, there are no 'Ifcrsian territorial waters” in the Shatt-al-Arab. If on the other hand it was round the comer of Abadan Island in the mouth of the Bahmanshir there does not seem to be much point in mentioning Gusba ♦ It would be as easy to say 'between Pao and the Bahmanshir' or between 'Abadan Beacon and the Bahmanshir'. Of course the dh^w may have been up one of the creeks that run into and across Abadan island, in which there would be no doubt that it was in Persian territory. We should be very grateful if you could clear up some of these points with Mohammerah, without if possible saving anything to the Persian authorities. We have to be very careful about anything that suggests a Persian claim to territorial waters in the Bhatt. In the meanwhile we have sent in a reminder to our note of February 3rd.

COPY (E 1524/1524/91) (193/7/33) 3rd March, 1933. My dear Hoare, Your despatch No. 9 of February 3rd regarding the arrest by the Persians on December 6th of a Kuwaiti dhow, bound from Kuwait to Fao. This incident raises a delicate question. From the information at my disposal there seems no doubt that this vessel was arrested in what, according to His Majesty’s Government’s interoretation of the Turco-Persian Frontier Protocol of November 1913, is ’Iraqi territorial waters. Even were this not so, it is clear that the vessel was towed under ^ Persian arrest ud the Shatt-al-Arab past Fao to Kasba, v/here she was detained, and has been commandeered by the Persians. The crew were taken to Abadan, for trial, imprisoned for ten days and then released, with the exception of the Nokhada, who, I understand, is still in custody. From the enclosed reoorts by the Port Director, Basrah and by members of the crew, you will see that the vessel was arrested on a charge of smuggling. This case appears to have two aspects: (1) The high handed treatment of the dhow, which is a matter between His Majesty’s Government as the protector of Kuwait and the Persian Government. (2) The violation of ’Iraqi sovereignty in ’Iraqi territorial waters. This is a matter between the ’Iraqi and the Persian Governments in wnich His Majesty’s Government is, as you know, aeeoly interested. Colonel Ward, the Port Director, Basrah, informs me that the Persians, in a series of pin-pricking incidents by which they/ R.H. Hoare, Esq., C.M.Gthey wish to exoress their dissatisfaction with the existing Shatt-al-Arab frontier, have been causing him ifiuch trouble recently. The arrest of this vessel is a case in point. My object in writing to you is to point out that if too much emphasis is laid on this case in so far as concerns the breach of ’Iraqi sovereignty, there is a possibility that the Persians might suggest submitting the case to the League or to some other form of arbitration, which would presumably not be welcomed by His Majesty’s Government. I therefore hope that you will do your best to discourage the raising of the question of territorial waters and that in any action which you may decide to take with the Persian Govern ment, you will restrict the case to the circumstances which concern His Majesty’s Government as the protector of Muwait and the Persian Government alone. I have sent a cooy of this letter to Rendel. Yours sincerely, (Signed) P.H. HUMPHRYS.Headquarters, Port Directorate, Basrah, Iraq. Dated 4th February, 1933 Dear Hurst, In reoly to your D.O. No. 189 dated the 2nd instant, and further to our telephone conversation this morning, from enquiries instituted through our Mr. Weeks at Fao it was found that two of the sailors from the small Kwaiti dhow you refer to are now in Pao and state as follows They were lying at anchor in about 9 feet of water off the Abdulla Bank on the Iraq side of the river about eight miles to seaward of Pao when a motor launch with about 12 armed men belonging to the Persian Authorities came alongside and enquired where they were bound ana what cargo they carried. The Nokhada informed them that they were bound for Pao with a cargo of suga 10 etc., and produced his papers in support of his statement. These paners the Persian Official destroyed in their presence and threw into the water after which the Nokhada and some of the crew were tamen into the launch and the dhow 7 was towed to Gasba where they were detained for nine days without food and subsisted on the sugar in their cargo which was stored in the place where they were interned. On the 10th day they were taken to Abadan for trial and the two men at Pao were released. The small dhow is now stated to be in use by the Persian Authorities at Gasba for inspection purposes. I have arranged for the two sailors now at Fao to be sent here to Basrah for interrogation. L.H. Hurst, Esq., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Basrah. Yours sincerely, (Signed) J.C.

Rendel, Esq., C.M.G. The Foreign Office. London.No. 375/3-13 11th March, 1933. My dear Humphrys, I was very much interested to receive your letter of March 3rd,(193/7/33) which gives the first definite information I have had as to the position of the recently captured Kuwaiti dhow at the time of its seizure by the Persians. I had hitherto feared that it was captured in the debatable area at the end of Maraket Abadan and the eastern end of the Rooka channel (see the correspondence between the Foreign Office and Admiralty of 1929). It was for this reason that I was not more precise in my note of February 3rd and suggested to ±&lt;o vie at the time that as delicate issues were involved, the Vice Consul at Mohammerah should merely try to obtain from the Persian authorities and the Nakhoda respectively an exact description of the position of the dhow at the time of the capture, without offering further comment. Fowle agreed, but Chauncy, the Vice Consul in question, has in fact only succeeded in extracting from the Persian authorities declarations that the dhow was captured 'in 'the Bahmanshir' later altered to 'in Persian territorial 'waters between Gusba (Kasha) and the Bahmanshir', a phrase which I must admit fills me with considerable suspicion. The suspicion has not been decreased by a further explanatory statement by the Governor of Mohammerah to his .Excellency Lieutenant Colonel Sir Francis Humphrys, G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O., K.B.E., C.I.E., His Majesty^ Ambassador, Bagdad.&amp; to the effect that the same phrase was used by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in an official reply I have now received simply becaure they repeated what he had told them, and by his going on to say that the point was that there is a Customs post at Gusba and that a Customs launch patrols from there to the Bahmanshir and that it was on this patrol (exact spot jincerjtain) that the dhow was captured. The officer who seized the dhow has said, however, that it was aground at the time of capture: and if it had been above low water mark anywhere on the Persian side it would of course presumably have been in Persian waters. He added that it was searched and found to have contraband sugar and groceries on board, that there was no proper manifest and that the Nakhoda had on him letters to two persons in Persian territory regarding delivery of the cargo. The Governor states in this connexion that it is well-known to both 1 Iraqi and Persian Customs officials that on payment of a very small sum, would-be smugglers are able to purchase two manifests, which they use as occasion requires. The Vice Consul has not been able to see the Nakhoda, because the Persians declare that he is a Persian subject. He is said to have signed a confession that he was a formerly convicted smuggler and that in this instance he had a confederate in the Persian Customs at Gusba (Kasba). I may say that Chauncy was told by his f Iraqi colleague quite recently that the information of the ’Iraqi authorities, though based mainly on supposition, tended to confirm the claim of the Persian authorities that the dhow had been smuggl ing:smuggling: the f Iraqi director of customs at Fao had expressed the opinion that a cargo of sugar from Kuweit could only be sold at a loss in Fao, and that had the dhow been captured in ^raq waters he would certainly have heard about it. The question of how far we (or the f Iraqis) are to protest against such behaviour by the Persians is of course a question of policy that does not directly concern me, but is it not going to be a little difficult to know when to cease turning a blind eye if the Persians go on doing this sort of thing? In this particular case the Persians would, I suppose, be precluded from maintajning that by omitting to protest we had subscribed to their view that half the Shatt was Persian, because of their statement that the dhow was aground at the time of capture, or alternatively in the Bahmanshir. Whether we believe them or not, it renders their version of the facts politically innocuous. But another case might have more insidious features. I admit, however, that we do not want any avoidable trouble while the Conservancy Board is still a possibility. As for the points about the seizure to which objection might be taken other than the fact that it took place in ’Iraq waters, I will make the most of them, but it is of course a little like Hamlet without Hamlet. I can perhaps lay stress on the seizure for no good reason of a peaceful vessel with its papers in order, and the subsequent unnecessary detention of the crew: But I fear that the Persians will only say that these are matters of fact which will be proved or disproved whenwhen the trial takes place. As a preliminary I am asking Powle for more precise information about the nationality of all concerned. The owner, Haji Mahomed Hussein,^is presumably a Koweiti. The Nakhoda Muhammad/Hussein) is claimed as a Persian subject. The other members of the crew are said by tne 1 Iraqi Minister here to be 1 Iraqi subjects. The goods were evidently the property of a Kuweiti, Yusuf bin Shirin. Perhaps Hurst could help in these enquiries. The nationality of the Nakhoda is, of course, the important point. I am in the meanwhile asking the Foreign Office for an opinion as to the position of all concerned in international law if the dhow really were smuggling. Would, for instance, the owner have a claim for redress against (a) the Persians (b) the Nakhoda, if the dhow were seized either as a punitive measure or to help pay any fines that might be imposed on the crew (in this case reduced to the Nakhoda). The owner of the goods, whether innocent or guilty, presumably has no redress except against the Nakhoda (assuming the Nakhoda to be guilty) - or the owner of the dhow. The extent to which I can press for the return of the dhow depends upon the answers. I am asking watkinson at Ahwas to arrange that Chauncy Shall keep Hurst informed of any local developments. Could you ask Hurst to reciprocate? Also would it be possible for enquiries to be made of the control vessel near to which the dhow was anchored at the time of capture.
