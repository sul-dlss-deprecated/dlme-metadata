In leaving this memorandum, Mr. Herschel Johnson stated that his government very much hoped that His Majesty’s Government would agree to their request# &amp; • * f-V* -t- ■VY ^ O 1 I o'*: ^ r. -X'l* - r . . - ^ ... It .vill be seen that the United States authorities are fully ^ h6 u XC ^ooi Ve A g reement whereby the Sheikh of Bahrein, on the 13th ^arch, 1892, agreed that without the assent of the British Government he would not consent to the residence within his territory of the agent ef-t-he -BraUsb Govemment he - wcrtl-d-not ^uiiainl within-^^r-^ry of thu agent of any other government. It may be presumed that the United States Government are also aware at no representative of any government other than His Majesty’s Government has hitherto been permitted to reside in Bahrein. The queston now for consideration is whether, in view of the present world situation and of recent changes in the conditions prevailing 111 Pers;La ^ Gulf » an exception can be to the policy Dllrsu e d m Bahrein and neighbouring territories since the end of the*last century^ereby permission has not been accorded to any foreign government to establish a representative in those territories. 4. Mr. Men desires in the first place to express the hope that, m view of the special relations at present existing between this country and the United States, the present proposal may be considered qs favourably as possible. Hr would suggest that, if Mr. /jnery should wish to obtain the views of the Government of India and the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, the telegram should contain a passage reminding them of the great importance attached by His Ma ^ S T Government to establishing the closest possible relations with the United States, and of the desirability of encouraging Analo- Lnited States cooperation in all parts of the world. - 8 -8 The Under Secretary of State, India Office. 5 ./Os 'V liSUfli) 5. Secondly, Mr. JSden would suggest that any telegram to the Government of India and the Political Resident should mention the fact that, since the recent development of the oil &lt; resources of the Arabian side of the Gulf, a considerable number of United States nationals already reside at Bahrein and in its neighbourhood, and that in these changed conditions the arrival of another United States national, even though acting as haval Observer on behalf of the United States Navy Department, would probably in practice have little, if any, adverse effect on British interests. , - • 6. There remains the question whether consent to the present proposal would form an inconvenient precedent, and would lead to similar proposals from other governments, which His Majesty's Government might find it difficult to refuse. On this point, Mr. Eden feels that^the acceptance of a United States ^aval Observer at Bahrein would not in practice oblige His Majesty's Government to accept proposals from any other foreign government to establish a Naval Observer, and he is of the opinion that, if such a request were received from any other government than the United States Government, it ought to be refused. • 7* Mr. Eden would be glad to be informed as soon as possible what reply should, in Mr. Amery’s opinion, be returned to this request from the United States Government. 8.

In reply, I am to inform you that the United States Government are sending Naval Observers to numerous places in the British Bspire, and it is presumed that the proposed appointment to Bahrein is part of a wider scheme, the object of which is probably to ^ establish closer Anglo-American co-operation in naval matters. As regards the status of the United States Naval Observer, I am to express the view that it would be generally desirable that the Naval Observer in Bahrein should be accorded treatment similar to, and at all events no less favourable than, the treatment accorded to the United States I Naval Observers in British territories. As regards oensorahip, it I would appear desirable that, as a matter of courtesy, the British I authorities concerned should not in practice endeavour to insist on | their right to censor his correspondence; indeed, it would be difficult ! to Justify &amp; decision whereby, when consenting to the appointment of a United States Naval Observer, an attempt would at the same time be 1 made to deprive him of the power of reporting confidentially to his Government what he observes. For this reason it is considered that the United States Naval Observer should also be granted cypher facilities if he desires them. As regards immunity from British The Under Secretax*y of State, India Office. Jurisdiction^I I jurisdiction, it is understood that the British authorities exercise Jurisdiction over all foreigners in Bahrein, and in these circumstances it would not he easy to make special arrangements for granting ormal exemption from British Jurisdiction to the United States Naval Observer, noredoes it appear necessary to give the United States Government any assurances to^this effect, specially since the United State. Naval Observers in British territories, e.g. at r«®town or Coiombo, will in theory also be subject to British ju risdiotion. It mjy be hoped, however/that difficulties will not in practice arise on this ^ of Jurisdiction, and that ai\y difficulties of this ^ arise, will be settled by friendly agreement between the United states Naval*Observer and the British authorities in Bahrein. 3 . There remains the que* tion of official relations between the United States Naval Observer and the Government of B **J r ^ n * ^ i * clear that His Hajesty*. Government have the right, if they wish, to stipulate, when consenting to the appointment, that the R ^ al ^ 8 ®f* ver * official dealings with the Bahrein Government shall be conducted through the Political Agent. I am to enquire whether Ur. Secretary Amery attaches importance to this matter, and to state that, if so, a stipulation on these lines could be inserted in the proposed ° United States Ambassador. A draft note, embodying a stipulation on these lines, is enclosed herein for Mr. Aasry’s ^onourrencf, 4* Finally, I am to suggest that the consent of the Sheikh of Bahrein should now be obtained to this proposed appointment., 5.

COJClAND^IW-CHIliF, EASTERN FLEET. €opy toi Chief of Intelligence Staff, Sastem Fleet. H.B.M.Ambassador, Tehran. H.B.M.Ambassador, Baghdad. Thh Hon^le The Political Resident in the Pei*sion Gulf. The Director of Naval Intelligence. mzm. mi* a MUk .mwvitfi* In the course of this year I have gleaned the information from ray own observation, and from conversations with Consular and other authorities, that the United States is showing a marked interest in trade developments in the Persian Gulf area. 2. The development of oil projects, some of which are shared with Britain and other countries, is, of course, as legitimate as it Is obvious. I gather that their enquiries ara not confined to oil, but in any case such purely trade and commercial activities are matters for Consular and Political authorities in which the Navy is hot indirectly concerned. 3. If, however, it should appear that U.S.Naval authorities are interesting themselves in essentially commercial inquiries, I deem it desirable that this should be known. And in this connect ion a brief review of the U.3.Naval set-up in the Persian Gulf is relevant. The following appointments are now held*- Basra U.S.Naval Observer. Lieut. Com. USNR. 2 Assistant Officers. 1 Commander. Khorramshalir Coast Guard Staff 1 Officer. 2 Officers. Abadan 1 Officer. Inspector of ?&gt;feterlal • Bahrain S-k&amp;.K.O. Staff. 1 Officer. 2 Officers. During the past six months the number of officers has gradually been built up to that shown above. 5. In March 1944 Commander W.N.Benkhart, U3NR, was appointed to the post of U.S.Naval Observer, in which he was releived by Lieutenant Commander C.£.Perry, USNR. on about 12 August, 1944 - Commander Benkhart then proceeding to an appolntement in Calcutta.IfiP - iiLuiiiL U.S.NAVAL OBSKir'BR, BASRA. (Persian Gulf letter No.1649/P.G.0657 dated 27th September, 1944). The dlreetif of the U.S.N'aval Observer Is not known to nor have I asked for this* The work naturally invclves keep ing a close liaison v/ith U.S* shipping matters* (no doubt in co operation with the ar Shipping iidministration}, and supervising the discipline and wellbeing of the Airaed Guards in U.S. merchant shipsj as well as the technical upkeep of defensive armament* The wellbeing etc. of merchant seamen is the duty of the Coast Guard Officers who however in cases of necessity refer to the &lt;aval Observer. The Naval Observer is also believed to supervise the work of the Inspectors of Material whose duty at Abadan seems to be closely concerned with that carried out by our Inspector of Admiralty Fuel. 7. That I have been impressed with other activities of the Naval Observer which extend to inquiries regarding trade activities at ports in f and at the entrance to, the Persian Gulf* and to port facilities. 8 . It is significant that both Commander Benkhart and Lieut enant Commander Perry are members of the U.S.Naval Intelligence oervice. Neither are active service officersj both are alert and intelligent. Lieutenant Commander Perry being a business man who in peacetime has served four years in India, one year in Ceylon and five in Burma. Before relieving Commander Benkhart he served for sone months as Naval Observer in Durban. Commander Benkhart, of Prussian descent, had a consider able part In the intelligence work leading up to the attack on Casablanca; he proved to be a most co-operative and friendly colleague at Basra, and seemed to be perfectly frank and open in his dealings with rae. During his appointment at Basra he visited Bahrain, Bushire and Kuwait, and accompanied me in H.M.S.'Beacon' on a visit to nandar Sliahpur. He evinced a desire to visit Muscat which, however, he did not achieve. 10. Lieutenant Commander Perry is the more •aggressive* type of American, both in manner and inquisitiveness. He has evinced an interest in Jask and Bandar Abbas; he has asked for information regarding the port facilities at Basra regarding which he referred to the Port Directorate. He has inquired about the Caspian ports regarding which I recommended him to apply to the U.S,Commanding General, Persian Gulf Command, at Tehran in whose orovince such * natters are. 11« Recently, at his instigation, the Resident Inspector of Naval Material B.S.N., Abadar^&amp;s shown in enclosure No.l. Since such information would have meant an infinity of additional work for the Naval Control Service Officer, ewi if he was in a position to supply it, and since it seemed to be essentially con cerned with trade as opposed to Naval matters, I discussed the matter with Lieutenant Commander Perry frankly and frlendily. He said the instructions prompting the inquiries’'were from the* Navy Department, Washington, and he said he thought the Department was not wholly appreciative of the set-up in the Persian Gulf and in consequence the intention of the inquiries was not quite clear. The object of the inquiries regarding /unericar (and this includes Panamanian) ships was to enable full facts to be available regard ing servicing of ships, i.e. D.li.M.S* matters, for U.S. shipping using the Persian Gulf. ^addressed certain inquires to the Naval Control Service Officer, Abadan /That being so.I*.. 1 U.S•NAVAL 0B3KHVKR, BASRA. (jpTersian Gulf letter No.l649/P # G, 0657 dated 27 September, 1944), That being so, I told him that it was net clear how British and other ships were of concern to him, with which he agreed. I then told him I would endeavour to obtain the necessary information regarding U.S. and Panamanian ships, though here it may be inter- .;)osed that my office keeps him supplied with all signals affecting movements of U.S. ships in the Persian Gulf. 12. I know little of the activities «f the U.S.Neval officers at otiier ports in tiio Persian Gulf, but the (Political Agent, Bah rain has expressed the view that there seems to be an unusual number of I - »S.Naval Officers stationed there compared with the amount of •Naval* interests involved. 13. In conclusion, lest it might be thought that I have any , phobist* views regarding our American Ally, 1 am happy to know that my relations with U.S. Naval personnel in the Persian Gulf have been as cordial as were those which I experienced at Oran and in the Western Mediterranean.6 V*&gt; TOP SECRET SUiUlD . enclosure No.l to Persian Gulf letter No, 1649/P,G* 0667. dated 27 Septenber, 1944.
