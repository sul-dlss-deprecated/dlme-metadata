I do not know if your reference was to him or not. I am afraid, drivers are rather a problem. I was driving back from Bharatpur with Johnson, the A.B.C. who runs the Viceregal cars yesterday and he told me that they had the greatest difficulty in getting reliable drivers even for their service.

In other ways he appears an experienced man, though I do not know tt at he is necessarily very much better than the type of man one can get in the Grulf, except that he seems to have had charge of a considerable variety of motors. As he does not know anything about Sleeve Valve Engines, I personally doubt whether he is worth taking such a long way, but I am afraid it will be almost impossible to find someone who has experience of this type of engine.

Lieut: Col: Gordon Loch., C.I.£*, Political Agent, Bahrain.BY AIR 'AIL . D.O.No.651. n Political Agency, Bahrain, the 3rd March 1936. ^^3 My dear Mackenzie, j Many thankb for your letter of the 17th February 1936 (which only reached me on the 2nd March) about Lachman. 2. I can now answer more certainly about what I can offer him, that is to say;- (l) He would be taken on as a non-pensionable Government servant, at ^,60/- a month, so that, should I be transferred, he would ordinarily remain in his appointment (subject, of course, to good conduct), (ii) he would get a uniform for use when driving, (iii) he would get a servants' quarters - at present indifferent but I hope that this will be rebuilt, • iv) he should come alone in the first instance and when he has had experience of the place, the question of giving him a deck passage for his wife and daughter could be considered, and ( v) he would not ordinarily be eligible for leave on pay, but as an unofficial arrangement he might get short leave occasionally when he would be given either pay or a return passage, whichever he preferred. 3. I usually go across to Bushire to act for the Resident The Reverend D.Mackenzie, Church of Scotland, Office of St.Andrew's Church, Fort, BOMBAY.- 2 - Resident for 2 to 3 months each year and this year am taking short leave before doing so. Lachman would, however, remain in Bahrain as driver to the officiating Political Agent. I should add that, though I have no reason to suppose that I skdfeid leave Bahrain, there is always at my time of service a possibility of that, but so far as one can foresee such things, his tenure of his appointment would not be affected - but one cannot, of course, give a definite undertaking. 4. He asks about expenses. Bahrain is not expensive and I think that ^.60/- is a good wage. There is a considerable Indian community and shops kept by Indians. 5. If he would like to come, I should be grateful if you would telegraph to Political Bahrain the one word 'Lachman', followed by the date of embarkation at Bombay. The British India slow mail leaves Bombay every Wednesday. I enclose a No Objection Certificate, so that he can get a visa for Bahrain, and a Supply Bill for ps . 118/- which represents roughly (a) the cost of a deck passage with food (b^ DS . 10/- for incidental expenses ^c) ^.50/- as an advance of pay f if he wishes for one) ^d) refund of the cost of the telegram (e) cost of passport and visa If there is any other essential expenditure on his Journey, I should be so grateful if you would advance it to him and let me refund it to you.
