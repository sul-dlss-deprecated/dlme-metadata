To Major P.3.Cox,O.I.E., Political Pa silent in tJi© Persian Gulf, B^ishira. Sir, 1 have T/ne honour to at ires a you on the stib.ject of providing a beacon on Kubber Island of a soiaewhat similar tfpe to that on ■bhe ias ul Arz as an ait to navigation. The want has been lung felt but it is onlj the arrival of me steam launch 'Lewis Pell:' that has made tne project a practical one for ue to attempt without outside assist ance. 3. Careful estimates have been prepare 1 hy me and an abstract of the expenditure in volved is appended to this letter. 4. The best time for undertaking the work would be during the last fifteen iaf s of March when calm weather is the rule in these parts.Some fifteen dic r 3 would be required for preparation of the wood work, so 1 would ask that sanction might, if possible, reach me before tne end of February .The cost would f all in tne financial year 1909-10. 5 # it may be pointed out that,if, at an: time, a full scheme for lighting tne PersianGulf were suionioned,Kubbar island would pro- c _..) bablj' be included uid uhe rough a^one of which •the beacon woul 1 be conuojed would certainly come in useful for foundibion, if nob consbrucb- -ion of +^he lighthouse an i Leener’s quarters. as all that should be needed is an occasional coat of bar for ’the discs. obtaining Sheikh kobarak's approval of the erection of the beacon,as 1 am not aware what rnasr be considered t;ae right policy witn regard to it.I have iuemioned the subject frequently in conversation and it nas alw^s been well received.lt is just ro^sible that ne may' make a demand for a trifling rent to mar* his owner ship of the isl and to which he 1 iy r s cl aim. If such a question was raised 1 would suggest that a inonthl5 r rent of -frvrees one might be paid to him b^it 1 antic in ate no litficuley of obtaining his saction on reasonable ter&gt;us and viou ^dI^, for nothing.In any case, if 1 am so instructed, it will be clearly understood that the work s anction being accorded. On the other hani 1 personally see no very cogent reasons why he should be consulted at *,11 in tne m itter. 6 No recurring expenditure is involved 7 1 nave sh far said nothing regarding 1 have the honour to be.

With reference to your letter No.9 dated 6th January 1909, I have tne honour to state that in view of the fact that a committee of experts is to meet at the end of this month, at Muscat, to discuss the general question of lighting the Persian Gulf, the Government of India propose to defer consideration of your * proposal for the present.

They were presumably put up by R.I.M.S.'Investigator' during the survey of the approaches to Koweit in 1906 and I see that the 'Palinurus' notified us that marks had been put up on Kubbar(as also on Qaru and Auhah) in March 1912. * If simple beacons on Kubbar are of any use, it might be well for us to take steps to erect them as part of our general lighting and buoying scheme.

In connection with the general subject of the lights and buoys and aids to navigation in the Persian Gulf, I have the honour to suggest, for consideration, the expediency of erecting certain additional beacons, and of assuming forrnal responsibility for the maintenance of others already in existence at various points in the Persian Gulf. 2. The report of the Lighting Committee of 1909 on the general question, and the subsequent action thereon of His Majesty s Government were necessarily directed mainly towards meeting the more urgent needs of shipping in respect 01 lights and buoys ; the provision and upkeep of beacons was only incidentally considered by the Committee in connection with particular arrangements at a few principal ports. The modified lighting scheme as at present sanctioned by His Majesty’s Government being in a fair way towards execution, I venture to ask Government to consider the subsidiary question of beacons. The initial cost likely to be involved by the construction and maintenance of these will be inconsiderable, while the existence of such finger posts, established and maintained by His Majesty’s Government at different points in the Gulf, will serve locally as a further demonstration of our special position in these matters and will also lengthen the list of “ Aids to Navigation, ” to our credit in the Gult. I have endeavoured to enumerate seriatim in the attached statement, the various existing or suggested beacons, with the necessary references to corre* spondence, etc., bearing on them. My proposals may be briefly summarised as follows (i) Existing beacons to be maintained : (Kuwait) Ras-al-Arz (already sanctioned). (Bushire) ,Ras-al- Marg. Jashk. Henjam. Bassidu. (ii) New beacons proposed : Halul. Khor Kaliyah (already sanctioned). Kubbar. The cost of erecting suitable beacons may be taken at approximately Rs. 500 each, and the cost of maintenance of the new and existing beacons at say Rs. 250 or Rs. 300 per annum. 3. I am forwarding a copy of this communication to His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, for favour of such observations and comment as he may consider called for. In doing so I would beg to explain that in submitting these recommendations to higher authority, I have regarded them as being indicated on the score of political expediency and utility, apart from the degree of advantage they may be considered to possess from the navigational point of view, and 1 venture to hope that they will be considered from both standpoints combined. Halul. It was suggested in 1906 that a masonry beacon should be erected on the „ „ .... Island, which is near the track of steamers 1906. between Debai and Bahrain, as an aid to navigation. The ownership of the Island2 is undecided, but there are some grounds for considering it as under Abu Dhabi, vide Residency letter No. 611, dated 23rd February 1913. Bahrain. Ras Zarwan Beacon.—This has been taken over from the British India Steam Navigation Company by His Majesty’s Government (at a cost estimated by the British India Steam Navigation Company of Rs. 1,000.) Khor Kaliyah Beacon.—K cairn was erected in 1905 by H.M.S. “ Redbreast ” as a mark for navigators entering the Ivhor Kaliyah. T. he Government of India subsequently approved its conversion into a permanent beacon at an estimated cost of Rs. 500 (vide Foreign Department letter No. 2064-E.B., dated 31st 31st May 1905) • i have ascertained that the work was never carried out, as no mason could be found to do the work, I have asked Major Trevor to arrange for its erection during the course of the constructions of buildings, etc., for the radio telegraphic installation now projected, Kuwait. Ras-ahArz Beacon. —The present beacon is pyramidical in shape about 30 feet high, surmounted by a black ball ; it is visible about 8 miles distant ; it was erected by the Government of India in 1905 with the approval of the Shaikh of Kuwait at a cost of Rs. 280 (vide Foreign Department letter No. 1681-F.B., dated 4th May I 9°5 Resident), and has since been maintained by the same authority. Kuhbar Island. —This is a point which steamers generally try to make when bound for Kuwait, and it is considered that a beacon on it would be of great practical value to navigators. It is recommended that the Shaikh of Kuwait be asked to consent to the erection of a beacon thereon of the same size and type as that on Ras*al*Arz. The lighting Committee originally suggested a light house on Kubbar and there is plainly a real need for a mark of some sort. Captain Shakespear, who visited the Island recently, reported that a big beacon of plain dry rubble maaonry could be built comparatively easily by local labour under arrangements made by him, there being plenty of good stone available. Bushire. Ras-al-Marg Beacon. —The Ras-al-Marg beacon in the inner harbour was washed away at the beginning of the present year ; it has since been replaced by a new structure which was constructed in the workshops of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Abadan and placed in position by R I.M.S. “ Lawrence ” on 6th January 1913 (a z'tfk? telegram No. 206, dated 1st February 1913 from the Resident to Foreign). Its navigational specifications are described in the tele gram quoted above, and it should be scheduled along with those already men tioned, as one of those for the maintenance and upkeep of which His Majesty’s Government are responsible. Jashk Beacon. —This beacon also should, I think, be scheduled as one of those the maintenance of which is undertaken by His Majesty’s Government. 1 he following is a description of it taken from page 143, Persian Gulf Pilot:— “ Clearing Marks. A beacon consisting of three posts with a large square board, painted black with a white disc; stands on the shore as a guide to the anchorage. ” Jashk Stone Beacon. —This beacon is no doubt primarily intended to indi cate the position of the cable, but it is convenient that it should likewise be ' scheduled as one of the beacons to be kept and maintained by His Majesty’s Government as part of the general scheme. It is some 30 feet high, and painted in black and white bands. Henjam Beacon .— Vide page 155, Persian Gulf Pilot. As above. Bassidii Beacon. —This is described in the “ Persian Gulf Pilot” as a beacon consisting of 1 mast surmounted by a cask ; the whole about 40 feet high and visible from 5 to 6 miles. It should be scheduled in the same way as the other beacons mentioned above. C 4 FD— 44 — 11 - 4 - 13 -GCBP SimlaBritish Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, 6th January, 1914. To The Political Agent, Kuwait. air, I have the honour to inform you that sanction has been accordod by the Secretary of State to the construction of a beacon at Kubbar Island at a cost not exceeding Rs 500 (Rupees five hundred only) , and to request that you will, in consultation with the Officer Commanding R.I. .3.
