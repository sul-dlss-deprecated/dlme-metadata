An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 1-172; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled. A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence regarding proposed and actual trips abroad that were made by the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah.This includes details of plans that were made for trips to Egypt, India, Iraq and England that do not appear to have ultimately materialised, and visits that Shaikh Ahmad made to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, in 1939 and 1949 respectively. The political context of these trips as well as the practicalities and travel arrangements involved are discussed.The majority of the correspondence is between British officials, but the file also contains some correspondence between Shaikh Ahmad and the Political Agency in Kuwait that is in Arabic (accompanied by English translations).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>State visits</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000ae#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000ae#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
