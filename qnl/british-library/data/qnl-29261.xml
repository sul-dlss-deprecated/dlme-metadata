As you will remember both these ^notes were [grp undec] the Ministry by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires and in accordance with instructions in your telegram under reference I replied to this further communication on 9th August in the third person note stating that His Majesty's Government do not recognise any Persian claim over Bahrein (my despatch P/2271 9th August, 1948), 2. The Minister for Foreign Affairs asked to see me this morning and said he had been surprised to receive a reply from us to his note of 1st August. As on various previous occasions, the Persian Government had felt bound to record their views that their rights over Bahrein had been clear. They did not wish at this stage to re open the whole issue but if we insisted on replying as we had to their note we should compel them to do so. The Minister said that as we had not in the past replied to similar protest by the Persian Government he hoped we would now agree to withdraw our note. I said I would ask you for instruction on this point, 3# If, as I believe, the question of declaration by the'lrab States about Rta[grp undec] line in Persian Gulf is now imminent you may wish me to defer replying to the Minister for Foreign Affairs until I have to make the communication foreshadowed in the correspondence resting with your telegrams Nos, 486 and 487.

He very sensibly said that since he wished for our support in connexion with his internal policy it would be foolish to disturb relations between the two countries by raising this main and tiresome question. So long as he stayed in power his attitude would be to leave the question as it stood at present and that he would limit himself to preventing the Persian juridical claim being in any way prejudiced or surrendered.

The Persian .Ambassador. called on the 12th June and read out a” telegram which he had received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs describing your conversations,; The. telegram' concluded by reporting that .you had:suggested that further'discussions on the subject'should be conducted between the Persian Embassy here and the Foreign Office. ;i 2. The ambassador was told why you had returned the two notes. It was explained to him, that, as understood here, you had no intention of suggesting that discussions should be begun between the Embassy and the Foreign Office, and that you had simply meant to convey that if the Minister of Foreign affairs felt that he must take the general Bahrein question up with His Majesty's Government he should control the matter himself and not leave it to be dealt -with in routine unsigned memoranda. The opportunity was taken to impress on the ambassador that it was highly undesirable in Persia's own interests to raise this controversial question, on which the views of His Majesty's Government were already very well known, at a time when His Majesty’s Government were struggling virtually alone to secure a just and reasonable solution of the question of Palestine. Please take any early opportunity of ensuring that the United Secretary for Foreign Affairs realises that you were not (repeat not) suggesting that discussions about Bahrein should be opened and that I continue to hope that the Persian claim will not be formally raised. 3. Should the Ministry of Foreign Affairs show a strong desire that you should after all receive these notes you should do so and should reply in much the same form as the note which you received, pointing out that His Majesty's Government in the /United Kingdom do not, as% 6 6 6 6 6 F oreign Office telegram to Tehran No, 318. ~2~ United Kingdom do not, as the Persian Ministry of Foreigi Affairs are well aware, recognise any Persian claim over Bahrein, which is an ^rab Sheikhdom in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government who are responsible for the Sheikhdom's foreign relations* 4, . You should also reply in the same sense to any further Persian protests on the subject of Bahrein* Provided that this is done I do not see any particular objection to your accepting any further notes which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may send. By sending these routine protests the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are enabled to reply to critics in the Majlis that they are taking such steps as are open to them to safeguard Persia's position and can thus hope to ward off requests that they should take more far-reaching action such as the initiation of a general discussion of the Bahrein question with His Majesty's Government*[This telegram retained by the is of particular secreey andbshoul.il be autaorised recipient and.not passed on] Cypher/OTP DIPIDPhTIC DISiTIBUTION .

Iskandari referred to previous correspondence on the subject between Mis Majesty’s Government and Persian Government and in particular to Lord Clarendon's despatch No. 1869 which he misquoted. He drew conclusion in view of existing dissension between the Great Powers no time should be lost in pressing His Majesty’s Government to give practical recognition to justice of this Persian claim. In his reply Minister for Foreign Affairs denied all knowledge of any attempt on the part of Qawam to reopen this question and concluded by saying that Persian Government would lose no opportunity of asserting its rights over Bahrein. 5. No responsible Persian Minister could have said much less than this but I took an opportunity yesterday evening of speaking to the Minister in the sense suggested in your telegram under reference. In particular I warned him His Majesty’s Government would regard any attempt by Persian Government to reopen this question as a gratuitous attack and that they had not the slightest intention of modifying their attitude. The Minister did not demur and I feel satisfied that he knows exactly where he and his Government will stand if they show weakness in this matter. /4.

The bill was admitted without a division and referred to the Commission. It is sponsored by such Soviet stooges as Abbas Iskanderi and Rahimian and also by some more reputable. 2. I told the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning that the ventilation of this question will make endless trouble for both of our countries and I am sure he will do what is possible to prevent it. The Government has, however, to face a vote of confidence shortly and I think it wiser to await the result of this division before applying further pressure. If the Government do not succeed in killing the bill you may wish to make a further statement.

Sir Rupert Hay, C.S.I., C.I.E., Resident in the Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN. My dear Hay, As a result of the revival of the Bahrain question in the Persian press, I have recently issued a certain amount of background material for the use of Consuls and Embassy officials. None of this material has so far been issued to the press but I am having Persian translations prepared in case of need. r i i | 1 ^ O \J As you probably know, it is only comparatively recently that we have been able to establish the necessary machinery for getting our material into the press. The Bahrain question has often been handled by the press before but always in complete ignorance of the facts. It is noteworthy that Chamberlain's note of 18th February, 1929, although published in the League of Nations official journal in May of the same year, has never been published in the Persian press and I doubt whether many Persians outside the II. F.A. are even aware of its existence. For the present the Ambassador does not wish us to enter the fray. If, however, the campaign goes on (it may of course die down as quickly as'it has started), we may have to weigh in. When we do so, in addition to publishing factual historical material and setting forth our attitude towards the Bahrain question, we shall have to publish the facts about the Persian community's position in Bahrain, the use of the Persian language and the facilities which exist for the education of Persians. We should also show, If it is possible, that the Sheikh's administration is as good as, or better than, Persian administration. Unfortunately, none of this information seems to be available here. I recall that a few years ago when I was running the Publications' Division in India we were sent an excellent pamphlet, issued by the Bahrain Government, which gave all the necessary information, I believe Chancery have already asked you for a copy of this and lor anything else which may have a bearing on the subject. I find that, owing to an oversight, we do not appear to be sending you our Daily Press and Radio Summary, I have given instructions that it should now be sent regularly and also our Weekly Iranian Newsletter, which I believe you will find useful. Yours sincerely, (SGD) G.E.WHEELERr SBCflK ).' ■ V).C. NO. C/872. Jf 'W f T ms | 1 y POL I riCAL AGEliCY BAHI.AIL. Th*? 18 ch of ;; arc's1948, Dear Sir Rupert, I have made inquiries about uhe size and position of the Persian minority in Bahrain as requested in your demi-official letter no.310-8 dated the 3rd February, 1948. and although I am fax’ from satisfied as to the results, I am for warding them in order not to delay further a reply. 2. First of all, I enclose copies of,my letter No. C/181, dated the 9th February, 1948, to Bel- grave, and of his reply. From the latter I have found it a little difficult-to draw .precise con clusions, but X am,not blaming Belgrave for this? the fact is that in ail such inquiries we are often defeated by trying to define terms which have locally very loose applications, and by seeking categorical replies where it is impossible to give them; The categories mentioned by Belgrave are: (1) Bahama (2) Persian Shias - H k}m n (3) Persian Sunnis and Holies. I agree *lth Belgrave thac (so far as T in tham at all) *^he number of 'true Persian-- In .&gt;a;n aln the order of 20,000 and I taiu-c chat they are IJrtfwVK proportion of 15,000 : 5 000 &gt;,.»«» cac^orles 2 and 3. fou will no„Ice that In aeigrave 1 =., ttr he admits that there are elements in air -nrea fi reaorie’ ready to support -he Persian claim. 4s to . caoegorle- rea / . a9ke&lt; | t0 state cacegor- lo^fy wSethef they are 1 in favour of U, I would hazard thfsLI^ent that they are.

Hasan f^udafi 1 s family who come from Ling eh. Furthermore, it is common to hear the question asked as to whether a man is a 'Baharani' or 'Sunni'. Belgrave gives, or estimates the number of Shias at 50,000 though I have heard it put at a higher figure. If we take 15,000 of these as being 'true Persians' and 12,000 as Bahama (i.e. racially speaking real Bahama of 'aboriginal' origin), we are still left with 23.000 Shi a to be accounted for* I do not want to delay this letter by referring again to B^lgrave, but I don*t think his letter gives the prominence to this element that they deserve. They, I think, are the towns* people describing themselves as Bahama but really of Persian origin and containing politically conscious and active elements. My information is that they are pro- persian. 4. So far as it goes, this letter also seems to reply to your demi-official letter No.460-S dated the 21st February, 1948. Yours sincerely, Sd./- C.J.

Belgrave, fsq. c b ^ Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain! •’ „„„ „ Our Ambassador in Teheran is, for reasons which you can well imagine, asking for information on the internal situation in Bahrain, and, in particular, on ^he size ana position of the Persian minority, in a lOiatoi which you wrot® to me &amp; couple of years apo (your demi-official letter N0.1389-9A dated the °2nd July, 1945) you gave the number of Persians as 7,547. Would this be about the number now? If not, canVou* let me enow what it is? As regards the distribution of Sunnis and Shias you estimated (enclosure to your memorandum No.l?38-9A dated the 21st August, 1946) the total population of the Island at about 100,000 half of them being shias and half Sunnis. I have had a report that 'all the Shias of Bahrain by reason of religion and origin, have strong feeling towards Persia', perhaps you would comment on this*? Presumably it is not true of the Baharnah? I have never heard them described as Persians. I have always believed that the 'true Persians' (as distinct from the 'holies') in the Island are all Shias. Is this correct 0 It is the figure for such 'true' Persians which T am anxious to get. Do you consider that all of those are in sympathy with the Persian claim to Bahrain 0 I imagine the poorer ones do not care one way or another, and probably do not even Know of the question. NS.ssomm. D«U • Ho. 78a. February 17, 1948. It is difficult to give accurate replies to some of the [uostions in your letter No. G/181 of 9th Feby. 1940, in which you ask for information about the um ber of Persians now 5 in Bahrrdn. According to the census t Kon in 1940, vhieh was the first census ever made in Bajirrin, 7,847 persons were registered as be ing Persian subjects, that is to say at the time of the census they described themselves as Persian nationals, but it cannot be assumed that these were the only people of Persian nationality then resident in Bahrain. e did not go into the question of nationality very tho roughly at that time, our object was to make a count of the population, so many people who were not Bahrain sub jects may have described themselves as Bahrain subjects. The number of Persians in Bahrain has increased very con siderably since then, during 1945, 1946 and 1947 about 3,000 Persians entered Bahrain, with travel documents mostly from Dubai end Sharjah, describing them as sub jects of those states, but as many of these Persians scarcely know a word of Arabic it was obvious that they were not genuine residents of the Trueiai Coast. We believe that the number of Persians who have entered the country illegally is not much less than the number who have come with passes. When once they get to Bahrain vor few Persians seem to leave the country, except on visits to Persia from which they return. Apart from the census returns we have no figures showing the number of Persians in Bahrein so I cannot give an estimate sup ported by facts but I urn of the opinion that there are not less than 20,000 Persians now living in Bahrain, byby this figure I mean people who claim to be Persian subjects. As you 'knew according to our nationality rules everyone who is born in Bahrain and who is not registered as a foreigner is counted to be a Bahrain subject. At present there is a tendency for people who are not legally li- hi'aia * ubjests to claim Bahrain nationality, mainly be cause passport facilities and employment are simplified for Bahrain subjects, but Persians who are Bahrain subjects in Bahrain become very d if ini holy Persian as soon as they set foot in their own country and they nil acquire Persian travel documents while in Persia, a. The number of people in Bahrain who are regis tered as being entitled to rations is now 105,000, but as many people do not draw rations I believe the total popu lation may bo considerably more than thin figure* I am still of the opinion that the population is about equally divided between Sunnis and Skins, the latter sect includes Persians and Hassowis. I entirely disagree with the re port quoted in pam S of your letter* The Bahama are not Persians and would strongly object to being described aa such. Admittedly they are of the same sect as the Persians but apart from this they have little in common with Persians and they are more closely connected with the Arabs of Bahrain than with the Persians who live in Bahrain* None of the country Bahama speak Persian and onliTTfe^^/^fe town. ,, B*h*rM hav Q/ intermarried with them^in those oases it has almost invariably been Bahama iaen who have t'f Kon Persian wlvus, not Bahrain nlrls who have boon given in marriage to Persian men. Shen Persian v/omen are absorbed into Bahama families they seam to acquire the Bahama point of view and are hardly distin guishable from Bahama. In spite of their common roli- .■&gt;:ion Persian* and Bahama keep themselves entirely sepa-u, 3, oepar^ ue in religious matters, they do not gencimMy worship in the eame mosques, they have separate raateias and, to a certain extent, in Manaraah, they occupy different districts in the town. There are no Persians liviny in tho Bahama villages* &lt;5, X have recently discussed the question of Persian influence in Bahrain -with a number of different people and all that X have hoard lately supports ray oan previous opin ion which is that the Bah^ima as a whole have no sympathy or liking for the Persians. The villagers know little about the Persians and have little contact with them and they form tho majority of the Bahama; the Manamah Bahama, who are better educated, who travel more and who are interested in politics, would not welcome Persian rule in spite of their inherent dislike of the Ruling Family which is based upon the fact that tho Ruling Family now own the property which used to belong to the Bahama and also because many of the older men remember the oppressive measures of the Ruling Family in the past. There are however among the town Bahama individuals who have strong personal reasons for disliking the present regime, such as the ex-qadi. Shaikh Abdullah bin Mohamad Saleh find others, and who would be will ing to intrigue with Persia though they would not come out into the open and if they tried to get support from the Bahama eoramunity as a whole they would meet with no success. I feel that I should say that because the Bahama regard me as their supporter they talk to me very freely about their feelings and their political aspirations. 4. There are three different categories of Persians in Bahrain, Persian Shins ”Ajem vv , Persian Sunnis and Rolls, the last two categories overlap. The Persian Shins are f r the most numerous, they include most of the coolies, boatmen, bakers, small shopkeepers, coffoe shop proprietors, domestic servants, taxi drivers, many of the water carrierscarriers and some important merchants who trade princi- I pally v/ith Persia* Bom© of thorn are Bushirin r»nd Kazor- roonis find most of then are from the Persian littoral* The Persian school provides for the education of many of their sons though some attend the Government schools* They have their own mateias* for men and for women, their own club, the Firdosi Club, and their own mosques* Taken as a whole they are a pool', harworking community# Many of thorn live in Barastis and few of thorn ovm property* The majority of them live in Manomah though there is a perBlenShia community in ITuharraq* Their language is Persian and in many cases, eopacially among the women, they speak no Arabic. In this community, who have very little to lose, there are certainly many who would like to see Bahrain taken over by Persia* They suffer certain disadvantages at present through being foreigners aife. they probably imagine that under a Government of their own kind and creed they would enjoy a better position than they do now* There are young men among them who are sympathetic to the 'Tudeh” movement* During recent years a certain mount of propaganda literature has been brought into Bahrain from Persia but it appears to be mostly directed against the old fashioned Shia religious beliefs and obser vances and is frowned upon by the older generation of Per sian Bhino* 5* The Sunni Persians include a number of wealthy and important merchants who own property in the State such as Mahomed Tyob Khunji, Yusuf Ali Akbar, Shaikh Ishaq and others* Most of them are self made men who cam© to Bahrain dth little or* no money and acquired riches from successful trading. Twenty years ago all these people were Persian subjects and they had no wish to acquire Bahrain nation? but when the nationality law come into force in 1939 they were compelled to become Bahrain subjects to avoid losinglosing their properties. The Sunni Persian; — they still ere Per si mz to all extent ,ad purpose — travel abroad to Persia and India t they speak Persian snaong themselves, their children attend the Government schools and they all belong to the Shafi sect, the Arabs and the Ruling Family are Malikis. Coromercially and socially they are closely connected with the Hoi is and have little? sympathy with their Shi a countrymen* They never intermarry with the Arabs, -who rega rd them ana. the Holis, ns Persians. They have vested interests in the country and in Persia, they are a minority so it is not likely that they would welcome Persian domination. But hare again there are young men among them who are capable of wishing to see the Persians in Bahrain end some of the older men are anti-British and anti-Government* The sons of Mohamad Tyeb Kbunji have for •• Ion. . time been suspeotdft nd one of the sons of a old junni Persian Shaikh, who died recently in Bahr in, edits a newspaper in Teheran and his brother is in Govern ment service there* Men of this type would willingly lend their help to the Persian cause* 6* The Hollo are Uunni Persians, of the Shafi sect, who have been established in Bahrain for several genera tions. They and the Sunni Persians claim that their micoe- tors were Arabs who migrated from Arabia to Persia many centuries ago, some of them, later, rocronsed the Gulx &amp;© Bahrain r-nd to other Arab states such as patter and Oman* They call themselves Arabs but the Bahama and the Bahrain _ H rabf. invariably refer to them as Holis. Few of thorn have been in Bahrain for more than two or three generations and in most cases, whore the facts are known, the founders of the families were persons of small importance ouch as water carriers, charcoal burners and sweat makers. They are not really liked by the Arabs or by the Bahama and they do not intermarry with the Arab*. There have been a fewfew instances in recent ynars of Arabs accenting offers • for thuir aauishters frota HoXis but in most cases the marriages have been forbidden by the Ruler at the request of the other members of the Arab’a family or tribe. Like many people whoso origin is dubious the Hoiis advertise themselves in every possible way as being true Arabs though many of the older men fiiaong them still refrain from rear ing the Arab Agal. They include the Kanoos, fakhroos, Siadls, Yotoems f Chirawis and Bin Mutters, Moayyads and, many other well known families. A number of them live in Muimrraq. Coimiorcially they are the backbone of the community, they are energetic and prosperous and h-ve more ability in trade both in the bazaars nil in the pearl mar kets, than the Arabs or Bahama. Probably their mixed Persian and Arab background is on advantage to them. At the same time they are always conscious that the Arabs regard them as Persians. The Khnlif- h shaikhs for example, will pay more attention to a ragged Bedouin from the desert &lt;A-' than to Holi merchant. The Hollo are bettor educated and richer than the Arabs, they own much property both in the towns and in the country, they are progressive and keenly political. At heart they are opposed to the Ruling, Family. Because they have no tribal ties to bind them there is little cooperation between them and each family or group seek their own advantage at the expense of the rest. Young Ho lie nro the leading lights in the clubs, h largo propor tion of the clerks in Government and commercial firms ore Kolia, though it is the policy of the Government when pos sible to employ Arabs or Bahama. The wealthy Holi merchants are ccsrtainly opposed to the Persian Government but they would like to have more control over the Government of Bahrain though in alfairs where they have boon given a large measure of control they have proved to bo completely lacking in public spiiit *Uidand concerned only in furthering their own internets In this respect the Arabs and the Bahama have shown .^va ohown buoji’ selves to bo luore disinterested. The young Hollo resent tho attitude of the Khalifnh end the Arabs who do not regard them as true Arabs. Many of them ore leaders of tho BO called 'National Front'* and those leaders have recently been trying to attract the Bahama to their party, but with small success. The young Hulls profess to bo patriotic and opposed to the Persians, they organised the appeal for funds for Palestine and the anti partition de monstrations and they claim to bo tho supporters of the working classes, but some of them are sympathetic to the Persians. In tho last Wo notices which wore issued by the '’National Front” they threatened to appeal to Persia if they did not got what they wanted. It is known too that wii*% Immediateiy^ne left Bahrain Abdullah Zaera was in tough with Saad bin ShQialan, a notorious agitator, whose son the head clerk of the Imperial Bank of Iran, is tho secretary of the Muharraq Club and one of the leaders of tho 'National Front”. Although most of the more responsi ble and o£jL;r Holis would certainly not welcome the Persians in Bahrain yet there is cause to believe that for political reasons many of the young anti-government Kollo, who direct tho affairs of the clubs would give secret support to a pro-Persian movement, because by so doing they mi:.fit advance their own cause in Bahrain* 8. faking the different people who make up the popu lation in Bahrain and their reaction towards the Persian claim,^none of them regard the claim as justified. It would find no support from tho Khalifah and the Arabs, unless from an individual who was personally antagonised towards his community. It would find no support among the village Bahama. A few of the town Bahama might be willing to /* intrigue and politics are their metier. fh© Sunni Persians*»U— Persians would not be sympathetic. A fairly large pro- poition oi the Ihi?

But we are most doubtful of the advisability of bringing the Government of any Arab State of the Middle Bast into the questions While none of these Governments would wish to see Persian dominion established over Bahrein it may very well be that if they come to take a close interest in this and other Gulf States under our protection there will be a grov/ing tendency for them to suggest that we should get out end leave these states to their own resources, ^ And the danger of such a tendency developing is we think probably particularly strong with regard to^Ibn Saud who, if our protection were withdrawn from Bahrein, Qatar and the Trucial Sheikhs might expect to absorb all or many of them.

Tehran telegram No. 86. Persian claim to Bahrein. State Department have been considering how Persian agitation about Bahrein can best be discouraged. They are now telegraphing to United States Ambassador in Tehran to suggest that he discuss with His Majesty* s Ambassador the possibility that the latter might represent to the Persian dovernment that agitation on this question might be unwelcome to the Saudi Arabian G-overnment with whom the former hope to renew diplomatic relations* This telegram is being repeated to the United States Embassy in London* 2* State Department asked for our views. Our first was that the Persian Government might resent an attempt by His Majesty’s Ambassador to drag Persian-Saudi Arabian relations into a question in which His Majesty’s Government are known to be closely interested. An alternative might be to prevail upon King Ibn Saud to hint to the Persians during discussions about the renewal of relations that he would prefer them to leave the question of Bahrein alone. But the effectiveness of this would of course depend upon the strength of the Persian desire to come to an under - standing with him. 5. In sny case it seemed to us that it might be advisable to let the matter rest for the time being in view of the possibility of an early change of government in Persia, see paragraph 4 of Tehran telegram No. 127. 4.

After compliments: ' Yesterday we heard a statement from Houtera, broadcasted from the Middle Fast Broadcasting Station, which is British controlled, to the effect that some person claiming to represent the Bahrain national party has been in contact with the Government of Persia and has informed members of the Persian Parliament that the people of Bahrain would like to rejoin Persia as soon as possible.

F F F F / t\THE STATUS 0? BAHREIN. The Archipelago of Bahrein forms an independent Arab Sheikhdom under British protection. Its population is Arab largely Uttabit* Huwaia, . It is unconnected geographically with Persia, and its historical connection, on which the Persians base their claim, is slight and distant. K - The evidence available on the history of Bahrein early times goes to show that the Persians only exercised control over the independent chiefs of Bahrein part of the Christian era and between &amp; year the islands were conquered by the jaBtwmur who until the 11th century. for a period in the early .1).613-723,in which In the and were in the islands more than a Middle Ages power until ruled them the Arab rulers of I«%a3Sag- invaued Bahrein defeated by the Portuguese in 1306 when came under the latter^ intermittent control for century. In 1753 Bahrein became, at least in name, dependent on Persia but the islands have never been under effective Persian control since 1783 when the last Persian Governor was expelled by the Uttabi Arabs. During the 19th century the Sheikhs of Bahrein entered into a number of agreements with toe British G-overnrnent, By the first of these, in 1820, the Sheikhs were admitted to the benefits of the General Treaty of Peace between His Majesty’s Government and the Arab rulers of the^Persian Gulf in return for their agreement to abstain from piracy and tne slave trade, the suppression of which /in th e Persian Gu^/was His Majesty’s Government’s main preoccupation] in the inxn cen ury. In 1861 the dheikh entered a ’’perpetual vreaty of peace and friendship” with Great Britain in which he was explicit y recognised asA'independent ruler of Bahrein' and was guaranteed against aggression by the H Thiefs and tribes oi th- ^ , Closer relations with the dheikh were established asaresuit- of the two exclusive Agreements of 1880 and 1892 /^ ; . ^ delegated the conduct of his foreign relations to ,a.

In fact he has actually approached the Company and the first you heard about it was through his broadcast. In view of the breach of this under- staking it is difficult to attach much importance to the further reassurances which Qavam has now given you. 2. Apart from this his public statements on the subject of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and of Bahrein are deplorable. They are by implication most disparaging to the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company and they convey the impression that sub stantial concessions are being sought. Anti-British feeling is thus quite needlessly stirred up, and, in the light of these statements, Qavam or some other Prime Minister may well in due course argue that owing to the expectations of 'public opinion'' he has no choice but to insist on important modifi cations to the Comp any ? s concession. 5. Yfith regard to Bahrein Qavam knows very well that we do not and will not recognise the Persian claim. In seeking at this moment to raise a question which has remained dormant for some time his purpose appeal’s to be to appease the Soviet Union by attacking His Majesty's Government. 1 ». i• 1 ^ 4 ,, I 'sMH-therefore be grateful if you will speak to Qevam ^ in the sense of the preceding paragraphs and add that, while I do not expect or desire speeches of fulsone praise for Britain, I think that after all I have done to support Persia’s inde pendence, I here the right to ask him to refrain from .making further public statements of this kind and from stirring up trouble against us. 5. I an asking the American Embassy here to suggest to the State Department that the United States Ambassador in Tehran might speak to Qavan about the general undesirability of u arousing feeling against His Majesty's Government and in ;fparticular to press the Persian Government not to raise their !claim to Bahrein. 6. Now that Qavan is no longer Prime Minister I should be glad if you will take an early opportunity of informing his successor*of the view which I have taken of his (Qavam's) utterances and express the hope that he will not follow-his 1 example. - • &gt; 7. I leave the exact form of your representations to your discretion. ' '4 -u o H , iS lii ^ hxie3s the Shei ^ ^ Bahrein is recognised as the Ruler of an independent State, in special Treaty relations with His Majesty* s Government. No change in the status of the Sheikhdom is contemplated.** On the other hand, there can be little doubt that the question has been put down in order to elicit H.M.G. *s views towards the Persian Government 1 s claim to sovereignty over Bahrein, which has been asserted for many years past, and which has recently been revived in a broadcast by the Persian Prime Minister on 1st December, repeated in a speech of 3rd December (see Tehran telegrams at flag E below). Questions relating to the foreign relations of the Sheikhdoms should of course be answered by the Foreign Secretary, and if a Supple mentary were asked concerning the Persian claim, the G.R.O. spokesman would of course have to reply that this is an entirely separate question which it would be for the Foreign Office to answer. The Foreign Office are themselves reluctant to take the question now on the order paper since the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations is at present constitutionallyf responsible for our relations with the Persian Gulf States-^ but in all the circumstances, and as the question is put down to the Foreign Secretary perhaps it would be as well for the Foreign Office to take the question with a view to answering the probable supplementary by a decisive rejection of the Persian Prime Minister’s claim for which there is no justification whatever. 12.12.47.Department J PARLIAMENTARY NOTICE 1 Date.

I saw the Prime Minister this evening and received from him an explanation on the following lines. avor&gt; . 2. With regard to the Anglo-Persian concession I reminded him of the assurance which he gave me at our last meeting that he would inform me first if at any time or for any reason he wished to suggest a change in the concession ( see my telegram No. 1154 paragraph 2). Prime Minister said that in spite of the [grp. undec. ?untimely] words which he was reported to have used (see my telegram No* 1254) he had no intention whatsoever to suggest any change in the concession. In conversation with Mr. Gass a few days ago he had suggested that the company should make some contribution to the welfare of Persia over and above such liabilities as they incurred under the strict terms of the concession. He asked me to^makeit clear to you that in making this suggestion he intended that initiative and also any decision which might be taken should be enirely on the side of the company. 3. With regard to Bahrein no action of any kind had een taken beyond the formulation of a request by the ompetent committee of the Mailis for.official documentation, f his words had created a dilferent impression it should be ttributed to the political background against which he had poken. It could not be denied that there was at present eal concern in this country about the status of Bahrein, e agreed with me that if this question were now Tdi ed t was likely to give much trouble to * is repret he felt that there was no alternative. He sked me privately to consider whether it would not ? ossiblc to meet the Persian view the issue f some kind of imperial rescript establishing Persian uzerainty over this sheikhdom or alternatively to agree to nternational arbitration in some lorm. I a +h QU ght this ny specific comment but made it clear that I thought this most unfortunate initiative on his part. /4.nflf »2- 4, As regards the general situation the minister said there was a compj.ete deadlock.

I.—Geographical Situation 1. The Principality of Bahrein consists of the archipelago formed by the islands of Bahrein, Muharraq, Umm Na’asan, Sitra, and Nabi Salih, and by a number of lesser islets and rocks. Taken altogether these form a compact group almost in the middle of the Y-shaped gulf on the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf which divides the independent xAfab Trucial Sheikhdom of Qatar from the coast of Qatif in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 2. The term “ Bahrein ” formerly embraced the promontory of Qatar and the oases of Qatif and Hasa on the Arabian mainland, as well as the islands of the archipelago, and, according to Lorimer, “some authorities would attribute to it in the past an even more extended application, affirming that it once denoted the whole western side of the Persian Gulf from Ruus-al-Jibal to the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab.”3 V II.—Bahrein prior to 1783 3. The very conflicting evidence available goes to show that Bahrein was subject to Persian rule for a period in the early part of the Christian era, and between A.T). 615 and 723. It is stated to have been conquered by one Keshin bin Abdul Malik, and to have come under the sway of the Umaiyid Caliphs in the latter year, and to have remained under the control of the Caliphs until the close of the Abbasid dynasty in the 11th century, when it again became subject to chiefs if its own lace. Its mediawal history is obscure, but a writer who visited the islands in A.D. 1051 refers to the fact that half of the pearls taken in Bahrein belong to the Chiefs of Hasa on the Arab mainland. Idrisi, the Arab ^eo^rapher writing about a century later, states that the island ’ c ‘is governed by an independent chief. inhabitants of the two shores are satisfied with his justice and piety, and when he dies he is replaced by a person of equal virtue and piety.” It was conquered about 1320 by the (Arab) rulers of Hormuz, a kingdom finally subdued by the Portuguese in 1506, but which appears to have been tributary to Persia in at any rate its later days. Bahrein appears at the same date to have fallen under Portuguese control. The Persians have adopted in a recent Aote on the subject a statement that it remained under Portuguese control from 1507 to 1622. It would appear, however, that there are at any rate some breaks in the continuity of Portuguese control. An agreement of 1515 between the Portu guese and the Persians, under which the King of Hormuz was to be “ ruler of Hormuz in the name of King Dorn Manuel, his Lord,” provided inter alia that Portuguese shipping should be available to enable the Persians to invade Bahrein and Qatif. In 1522 a revolt stimulated by the King of Hormuz broke out against the Portuguese at Bahrein among other places, but was quelled, and in 1528 endeavours by the Portuguese to quell a subsequent rebellion in Bahrein against the King were beaten off. In 1559 it was temporarily occupied by the Turks, who were, however, driven out by the Portuguese in the same year. In 1602 the Portuguese were forcibly expelled from the islands by the Persians. The Persian occupation was of uncertain duration, and in their Note of 2nd August, 1928, they refer to 1622 as the date on which Persia regained possession of Bahrein. They appear in any event to have had a military depot in Bahrein in 1622. Curzon states that £t the Portuguese ... in 1625 concluded a treaty with Shah Abbas, by whiclh they restored to him all his coast possessions, retaining only the pearl banks at Bahrein. . . .” 4. In the early years of the 18th century the authority of the Persian Government in the Gulf area was at an extremely low ebb, and it seems most unlikely that they were able to maintain a garrison in Bahrein. In 1717 the islands were occupied by the Arabs of Muscat, who appear to have met with no opposition. In 1718 however, the Persians, by means of shipping lent by the Portuguese, were able to transport a force to Bahrein and temporarily to reoccupy the islands. During the confused period following upon the Afghan invasion of Persia in 1722, the Huwala Arabs established themselves on the islands : they maintained their control until 1736 when Nadir Shah (who had built up a naval force in the Gulf) sent an expedition to Bahrein and drove out the Huwalas. After Nadir’s assassination in 1747 another period of chaos occurred, during which the Huwalas or other Arabs, gained control over the islands. However, in 1753 the Ruler under the Persian Government of the town of Bushire made a descent upon Bahrein, the chief resident tribe in which (the Huwala Arabs—at the present day still strongly represented in the islands) was seriously divided by internal feuds, and established his authority there. In this manner the islands again became, at least in name, dependent on Persia. In 1782 the Arabs of Zubarah, on the Arabian mainland, efforts to reduce which had been made by the Governor of Bahrein under the Persians in the years immediately preceding that date, retaliated by a descent on the island of Bahrein. They defeated the Persian Governor, drove him to his fort, plundered and destroyed the town of Manama, and took possession of a Bushire vessel, with which they retired to Zubarah. A counter-attack was repulsed, and in the following year the Uttabi Arabs of Zubarah, assisted by contingents from various tribes of Qatar, occupied the Bahrein islands, the Persian garrison of the Manama Fort capitulating on 28th July, 1783, after a siege of about two months’ duration, and being allowed to return to Bushire. Summary 5. It will be seen that while the history of Bahrein prior to 1783 is very obscure, it would appear that Persia for not inconsiderable periods exercised control over the islands. The nature of that control is not, however, very clear; 85-177 fx a Bombay Selections, XXIV, 23, G. of I. Desp. No. 18 of 22.2.1870, para. 2. Wilson, Persian Gulf, pp. 85-6. Wilson, 88-90.

It is, however, clear that Persia or a Persian vassal was in effective control of the islands during the 30 years prior to the expulsion of the Persians by the Arabs of the mainland in 1783. III.—1783-1820. From the Expulsion of the Persians to the conclusion of the Treaty of 1820 with His Majesty’s Government Bahrein fays Tribute to Persia., 1799 6. Projects by the Persian Government for the re-establishment of its authority in Bahrein between 1783 and 1800 did not materialise. In 1799 the Imam of Muscat declared war on the Uttabis of Bahrein, who, alarmed by his proceedings, opened a correspondence with the Persian Governor of Bushire, in the course of which they stated that the island originally belonged to the Turkish Government but that it was many—about 70—years since the Turks had been in possession of it.f 1 ) He, on their offering to become tributary to Persia, proceeded privately to Bahrein and received from them an instalment of revenue on account of the preceding year. Muscat occupies and loses Bahrein, 1800-01 7. In 1800 Bahrein was occupied by the Imam of Muscat, the occupation lasting until 1801, when the Muscat forces were invested by the Uttabis and compelled to surrender and evacuate Bahrein. In 1802 the Imam of Muscat, having obtained some assistance from Bushire, again landed in Bahrein and attacked the Uttabis. The latter had, however, by now secured the support of the Wahabi rulers of Central Arabia and the Muscat project was abandoned. Bahrein under Wahabi influence, 1803-11 8. irom 1803 to 1809 the Uttabis of Bahrein appear to have been under the influence of the Wahabis (the Bombay Government declined to take action on an enquiry made by them in 1805 as to whether, if they withdrew from the Arabian mainland and withheld their assistance from the Wahabis, the British Govern ment would give them a ship or two to enable them to remain undisturbed at Bahrein) and they were under strict control by the Wahabi Government during 1 1810-11. &amp; Dispute with Muscat, 1816 Persian Envoy to Bahrein, 1816-17 9. In 18il the islands were freed from Wahabi rule by the Imam of Muscat, when the Uttabis were restored to power, though according to a claim subsequently made by the Imam, in subordination to Muscat. In 1816 the Uttabis sought the protection of the \\ ahabi rulers of Central Arabia, and the Imam of Muscat undertook an armed expedition against Bahrein, explaining to the British authoi ities that he was compelled so to act by the repudiation by the Uttabis of tl 1 , 8 .suzerainty, which they had admitted in 1811, bv their alliance with the Wahabis and by their piratical practices. The Muscat expedition to which three Bushire vessels were added by the Persian Government, effected a landing in the summer _ of 1816, but was signally repulsed and withdrew. Unsuccessful negotiations took place later in the same year between Muscat and the Persian Government with a view to a fresh attempt on Bahrein.

Bahrein submits to Muscat, 1820 13. The Persians, at the beginning of 1820, moved apparently by a desire to anticipate any attempt by Muscat to establish control over Bahrein with the support of Plis Majesty’s Government, unsuccessfully requested the Imam to convey their troops to Bahrein. They addressed a similar application, equally unsuccessful, to the Commander of the British Expedition in the Persian Gulf. Lor . r 84 7 In the early part of 1820 the rulers of Bahrein made full submission to the Imam of Muscat and agreed to pay him a tribute of 30,000 dollars. An instalment (12,000 dollars) of this tribute appears subsequently to have been actually remitted. Policy of British Government, 1819-20 14. The policy to be adopted by the British Government in regard to Bahrein was examined between the Government of Bombay and the Government ot India in 1819-20, and was ultimately defined as one of complete neutrality. Govt of The transfer of Bahrein to the Imam of Muscat had been contemplated, but Bombay to this project, so far as the British Government were concerned, was now abandoned. {Iifislg 1 he Government of Bombay suggested that the Sheikh should be informed that p j™s. 2 , 3 . so long as he restrained his subjects from piracy he would reap the advantage or a friendly neutrality on the part of Britain, whereas should a piratical spirit manifest itself forcible measures of coercion would be applied to him. They added that the conclusion of an engagement in general terms Avith the Sheikh would probably tend to convince the Uttabi Arabs of the integrity of our intentions.” British Offer to Persia of Mediation with Bahrein, 1820 15.

On 5th February, 1820, a preli i .a Treaty of Peace was signed between the Sheikh and His Majesty s (xoveinme . , and on 2Srd February. 1820 the Sheikhs were admitted to the benefits of the General Treaty of Peace which had been made between His Majesty s Govern ment tnd! the Arab rulers of the Persian Gulf and under which His Majesty s Government undertook, in return for abstention by those rulers from piracy nnd the slave trade that “ if any shall attack them the British Government shall take notice of’it - (Article 10). The Sheikh of Bahrein went so far as to claim subsequently that the treaty m question established relations of protec tion and dependence between the British Government and himse f, but it was made clear to him by the Political Resident m the Persian Gulf while on a visit to Bahrein in 1823 that this was not the case. Proposal for British Mediation with Bahrein not taken up by Persia 17 On 10th May, 1820, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran ^reported to the Government of Bombay that he had been received in audience by the Shah on 5th May and had put to him the proposal referred to m paragraph 15 xor British mediation with a view to securing tribute to Persia from Bahrein. Hie Shah had replied that “he wished that advices should be received from Shiraz before the mediation of the British Government to render Bahrein a tributary to Persia can be accepted.” Sir H. Willock remarked that “ the great repugnance of the Shah to the formation of any British settlement in the neighbourhood of Persia was strongly manifested by His Majesty’s not immediately accepting the British mediation to obtain a tribute from the island of Bahrein, an object which he so urgently desired and which His Majesty was aware must at a future period be difficult of attainment from the already advanced stage of negotiations between the Sheikhs of Bahrein and the Imam of Muscat.” and 'withdrawn (1820) 18. On the 3rd October, 1820, the Government of Bombay instructed Sir H. Willock to take the earliest opportunity of informing the Persian Government “ that as our views are exclusively limited to the extirpation of piracy, it would be contrary to our policy, in the present state of the Gulf, to afford the mediation we formerly offered between His Majesty [the Shah I and the IJttabis of Bahrein.” Summary y 1783-1820 19. In 1799 the Sheikhdom, independent since 1783, professed allegiance to Persia and paid a year’s tribute, but it was immediately afterwards con quered by the Imam of Muscat, and thereafter fell under the influence and ultimately the control of the Wahabi Amir. Liberated by Muscat in 1811, it appealed to the Wahabis in 1816 against the Imam and defeated him. In 1816 or 1817 a Persian envoy was received at Bahrein and presents exchanged. While no details are available as to what precisely took place on this occasion, the incident had no effective sequel. Persian authority was not asserted in the island between the date of the visit and 1820, and in the latter year the island became temporarily subject and tributary to Muscat. In 1820 Bahrein entered into its first formal treaty with the British Govern ment, and that Government, on condition that the Sheikhs abstained from piracy, undertook to “ take notice ” “if any shall attack them.”IV.— 1820 30 Unauthorised Agreement between Captain Bruce and the Prince Governor of Shiraz, 1822 ■ Captain Bruce, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf acting on his own initiative and without any authority from or prior reference to Government, having proceeded of his own accord to Shiraz there signed an agreement with the Minister of the Prince Governor of Shiraz on the part of ■’ersia. This agreement alleged, inter alia, in regard to Bahrein,’that the islands had always been subordinate to the Governor of Pars, against whose authoritv the Uttabi Sheikhs had lately become rebellious; that the flag assigned to the Uttabis of Bahrein under the General Treaty of Peace with Britain in 1820 should accordingly, if already granted, be withdrawn, that no assistance should in future be lendeied by Britain to the XIttabis of Bahrein and that on the con trary the British Government should, if requested, assist ’the Persians against Bahrein with “ one or two ” vessels of war. In other words, the title of Persia to the possession of Bahrein was explicity admitted. The arguments which car i led weight with Gaptain Biuce m concluding this unauthorised agreement appear to have been that the reversion of Bahrein to Persian authority would tend “ more to the tranquillity of the Arabian side of the Gulf than almost anv other act.” ■2P The Resident s action was immediately disavowed and disapproved by the Government of Bombay, in letters from the Governor to the Prince Regent of Pars (which stated that it is not the intention of this Government to take any part in the claims of the several Powers and States of the Persian Gulf further fhan may be necessary to prevent a renewal of piracy. . . . There can be nothing in the flag [granted to the Uttabis] to give offence to Persia, as there is not the smallest connection between it and the British flag, nor the smallest pretension to superiority on the part of the British Government ”), the Imam of Muscat, and the Sheikh of Bahrein, and as a mark of disapprobation he was removed from his appointment. With regard to the clause of the agreement affecting Bahrein the Government of Bombay remarked : “It acknowledges the King of Persia’s'title to Bahrein, of which there is not the least proof, and which the British Government cannot assert without injuring the pretensions of the Imam [of Muscat] and the Uttabis. . . .” On the Persian side, the Shah not only refused to approve the arrangements which had been made, but expressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz should have entered into any engagement with the British Government without his knowledge and injunctions. The agreement was thus repudiated by both sides. 1822-29. Bahrein—Muscat Disputes 22. By 1822, if not earlier, the Sheikhs of Bahrein had ceased to observe the engagement undertaken by them in 1820 to pay an annual tribute to Muscat. In August 1822, an attack by Muscat on Bahrein seeming in consequence imminent, the Governor of Bombay, in letters to the Sheikh and to the Imam of Muscat, Suggested that if this tribute was of ancient origin it should be regularly paid, but that otherwise it should be dropped. In January 1823 the Political Resident (Lieut. McLeod) visited Bahrein to reassure the Sheikhs in regard to the unratified treaty concluded by Captain Bruce with the Prince Governor of Shiraz, and to inform them that that treaty was of no effect and that no change of policy was contemplated by Government. In the spring of 1823, on rumours of a contemplated joint attack on Bahrein by Persia, Muscat and the Arabs of the mainland, the Minister at Tehran was asked at a suitable juncture to dissuade the Persians from disturbing the tranquillity of the Gulf. 23. In February 1824: the Resident composed for a period of two years the acute internal disputes between members of the ruling house which were for many years a feature of the history of Bahrein. In 1825 the Governor of Bombay personally remonstrated with the Imam of Muscat on an endeavour by the latter to interfere in the question of the Bahrein succession consequent on the death in that year of Sheikh Salman, who had ruled the Sheikhdom since 1796 (in association in his later years with his brother Abdullah). Reassertion of Persian Claim, 1825 24.

The mam provisions of this agreement were that tribute should not in future be paid by Bahrein to Muscat, and that neithei ruler should henceforth interfere in the affairs of the other. By a supplementary verbal agreement the parties bound themselves to aid one another in the event of an attack by a third party. Summary, 1820-30 26. During the first two years of this period the islands acknowledged the supremacy of and, for a time, paid tribute to Muscat. From 1822 to 1829 they were intermittently at feud with Muscat. In 1829 a treaty was concluded by which Muscat withdrew its claims to supremacy and to tribute. The Persian claim was alluded to in 1822 and 1825 but not pressed. ¥.—1830-40 Bahrein and the Wahabis, 1830-35 27. In the course of 1830-31 the Sheikhs, His Majesty’s Government having refused to intervene in their favour, and fearing a combination between the Amir and Muscat, formally submitted to the Wahabi Amir of the Arab mainland. They agreed to acknowledge the Amir’s supremacy and to pay a tribute to him. Lor. i, 856-7. He on his part undertook to protect Bahrein against external aggression. In 1833, however, the Sheikh felt strong enough to repudiate Wahabi supremacy, and he conducted a not unsuccessful offensive against the Wahabis between 1833 and 1835. Bahrein and the British Government 28. Sheikh Klialifah-bin-Salman, who had been joint ruler with his uncle Sheikh Abdullah since the death of Sheikh Salman in 1825, died in 1834, and was succeeded as joint ruler by his son Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifah. Effective control continued to rest with Sheikh Abdullah. Internal dissension in the ruling iamily became more marked between 1834 and 1839, and the misgovern- ment of the island continued to grow with unfortunate effects on its prosperity. His Majesty’s Government, although in 1834 they had to take forcible measures against the Sheikh to secure reparation for an insult to their Residency Agent in Bahrein, were, however, content to abstain from any interference in the internal affairs of Bahrein so long as the Sheikhs discharged the obligations undertaken by their Treaty of 1820. Restrictive Line applied to Bahrein, 1836 29. In 183o the British Government renewed the maritime truce which they i- L. ^ A 1 Oil 1 n ‘ . t • n . t had imposed in 1820 on the Arab rulers of the Gulf in the interest of the suppres sion of piracy. T he Sheikh of Bahrein was not, however, included in the l^ .bsoo. renewed truce, partly apparently because he had behaved so well that this was Precis, 3ou. thought unnecessary, partly because he could be easily punished in the event of this proving desirable, and partly lest in the event of his inclusion he mi^ht claim British intervention if attacked by Muscat. In March 1836 the Sheikh agreed, however, to the application to Bahrein of the “Restrictive Line” this being a line laid down in that year by His Majesty’s Government between which and the Persian coast no naval hostilities were in future to be permitted Reassertion of Persian claim.

As a result, he agreed to pay a nominal tribute of $2,000 to the Amir, the Amir on his side agreeing to supply troops for the defence of9 W Bahiein against external attacks and to refrain from calling on the Sheikh foi manne transport in the event of a Wahabi attack on Muscat by sea 31. in 1837 the Sheikh, with the prior approval of Her Maiesty’s Govern ment, was allowed to punish certain pirates. In 1839 the Resident was invoked to settle internal disputes m the ruling family, but the parties would not agree to any settlement without a guarantee by Her Majesty’s Government which Her Majesty s Government were not prepared to give. 'GG' Egyptian Invasion of Hasa . Sheikh professes to be a Persian Subject, 1839 . 32 - * n l? 38 ” 39 th ® Egyptians conquered Hasa and captured the Wahabi Amu. x ey theieupon demanded the payment of tribute and certain territorial concessions from the Sheikh of Bahrein. The Egyptian Commander about the same time intimated to the British authorities his intention to attack and reduce the island. The Sheikh appealed for assistance to the Government of India but m the absence of instructions from Her Majesty’s Government the Govern ment of India were at first not prepared to give him any pledge and the Sheikh was instructed to decide for himself as to waiting on the Egyptian representa tive. Much alaimed by the proceedings of the Egyptians, “and perhaps even more so by a rumour, apparently well founded, that the Saived of Oman was intriguing with the Egyptians to obtain and hold Bahrein as a fief under the Viceroy of Egypt,” the Sheikh thereon professed, in reply to demands made on him in the name of the Egyptians, to be a subject of the Persian Government. Apparently as the result of overtures by the Sheikh designed to substantiate this, the Prince Governor of Shiraz thereupon sent an envoy—one Haji Qasim formerly supercargo of a trading vessel—to reside in Bahrein as Persian agent, and to be the medium of receiving and transmitting the annual tribute which the Persian authorities vainly flattered themselves the Bahrein Chief was disposed to pay for their countenance and protection,” and to bear a Robe of Honour and a letter to the Sheikh. The envoy was accompanied bv a guard of ten Persian infantry. No details appear to be available about his mission, which was apparently a failure. 33. On 1st April, 1839, Admiral Sir F. Maitland, then commanding the Gulf Squadron, was instructed by the Government of Bombay to give the Sheikh all support against the Egyptians, short of actually entering on hostilities. If the Sheikh asked for a new engagement with Her Majesty’s Government he should offer to transmit his proposals to India. The Resident was simultaneously to send a formal protest to the Egyptians. On the 18th April the Government of India empowered the Admiral, if the Sheikh claimed British intervention and offered to place his territories under British protection, “to assure him of the temporary protection of Her Majesty’s squadron in the Gulf,” to inform the Egyptians that this pledge had been given and to urge them to abstain from further military proceedings until the views of both Governments were known, failing which Bahrein would be defended against intervention by them until the pleasure of Her Majesty’s Government had been communicated to the local authorities. In the same month the Sheikh promised the Assistant Political Resident to take no steps to place himself under the authority or protection of a foreign Power without first consulting the Political Resident. Sheikh submits to Egyptians (July 1839) 34. In July 1839 the Sheikh “ suddenly and unexpectedly” acknowledged the supremacy of the Egyptians and agreed to pay them a tribute of 2,000 dbllars a year, on the understanding that his local authority would be observed and that no representative of the Egyptians would be sent to reside in Bahrein. The Resident protested in writing to both the Sheikh and the Egyptians, and expostulated with the Sheikh on the way in which he was sacrificing his independence. The Sheikh explained that his action was the result of the refusal of Her Majesty’s Government to give him advice or a specific assurance of support. For a trifling financial payment he had now secured immunity from interference. He offered, however, in return for a written and distinct pledge of protection, to repudiate his agreement with the Pasha and to avow himself a dependent of Her Majesty’s Government; but on being pressed he refused to confirm this in writing and said that in any event it would be necessary for him to justify his change of attitude to the Egyptians on the ground that it was the result of compulsion by Her Majesty’s Government. 85—177 Lor.

She revolted from them in the latter year, but in 1836 again entered into an understanding, which appears to have lasted until 1838, under which Bahrein paid a tribute and received guarantees of assistance against external attack. In 1838 the Wahabi Amir was himself conquered by the Egyptians. The Persians reasserted their claim in 1836, the Bahreini answer being a renewal of their understanding with the Wahabi Amirs. In 1839, when faced by a demand for tribute from Egypt, Bahrein appealed to Persia, claimed to be a Persian subject, and received a Persian envoy But immediately after she formally acknowledged Egyptian supremacy and paid tribute to Egypt. The visit of the Persian envoy had thus no effective sequel. YI.—1840-50 37. In 1840 the Government of India, provoked by the attitude which the Sheikh had adopted, decided not to restrain the Imam of Muscat in the event of his wishing to conquer Bahrein. On 27th March, 1840, the Secret Committee remarked to the Government of India 1 We consider ourselves . . . . relieved from all regard to the interests of the Sheikh of Bahrein, and we should be glad to hear that his island was in possession of a friendly chieftain.” 38. Towards the end of 1840 the Imam of Muscat informed the Resident that while his views in regard to Bahrein remained unaltered, he had been restrained from giving effect to them by his impression that Her Majesty’s Government were averse to the prosecution of his claim and that without their assistance or that of the Egyptians he would have no chance of success. Expulsion of Sheikh Abdullah. Succession of Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifa (1843-68) 39. Internal dissensions in the Sheikhdom between the ruler, Sheikh Abdullah, and his grand-nephew and co-ruler, Sheikh Mohamed, became increasingly bitter, and Sheikh Mohamed was finally expelled from the island. Lor. i, 866. In November 1842 he was given permission by Her Majesty’s Government to attack Sheikh Abdullah. After a civil war which lasted from January to April 1843, Abdullah was expelled by Mohamed, who thereafter held the Sheikh dom, no reply being sent to an appeal to restrain the attackers which was made by Abdullah to the British authorities in February 1843. Intrigues of ex-Sheikh, 1843-49 40. Between 1843 and 1849 the ex-Sheikh appealed at various times for the assistance of the Wahabis, the Trucial Sheikhs, the Sheikh of Koweit, and the Lor. i, 873 . British and Persian authorities to enable him to recover his position. In 1843 Her Majesty’s Government dissuaded Muscat from trying to conquer Bahrein —considerations which weighed with them being inter alia the risk of provoking the Wahabis and the danger of giving Persia an excuse to espouse 'the cause of the ex-Sheikh. In the same year the ex-Sheikh twice visited Bushire, where he failed to find any consolation from the Resident, who, on his stating that11 if disappointed by Her Majesty’s Government he was ready to throw himself Persia to^causfwoSd‘not 0 b Qed hlm ■ (( ^ ct , ober 1843 ) that the adherence of declared 1 M 10t be reo °g nls ed by Britain unless it was open and the nephew of^h^Persk^^hlil-h ® x ~ 8heikh ? ntere d into discussions with tne nepnew ot the Persian Sheikh of Bushire, who, while holding no official position himself, promised him military assistance from Persia ofrepretmfa tions being thereupon made to the Persian Prime Minister by Her EstPs fmister at Tehran the Prime Minister “informed me that Sheikh Sideiman had acted with great presumption m having interfered in political affairs “ out having any authority from the Government, and he said that he would reprimand him for his conduct. His Excellency added that Bahrein beton'ed to Persia and that she would take possession of it when more pressing affairs were disposed of As I looked on this as mere idle boasting which wL neve likely to be fulfilled, I thought it unnecessary to pursue the conversation” 4A It may be recorded that on a second visit of the ex-Sheikh to Bushire from December 1843 to March 1844 he is stated to have been received with distinction by the Persians, and to have offered, if reinstated, to pay the rost to remit in future a large annual tribute to the Shah, and to leave one son as Government PelSla ' HlS P ro P osals were not, however, accepted by the Persian 43. In 1844 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was instructed bv the Government of India to resist by force any attempt by Persia to establish troops on the island of Bahrein, during the same yefr the ex Sheikh hav n. while residing at Naband in South Persia, captured two Bahreini vessels th°e ruling Sheikh appealed to the Resident, with the result that an injunction was issued by the Central Persian Government at the instance of the British envov directing the Governor-General of Ears to compel Sheikh Abdullah to give up the boats he had taken and abstain from disturbing the peace of the Gulf. Views of Her Majesty’s Government on Persian Claim and on future Policy, 1844-45 44. Consequent on indications that Persia intended to intervene in the succession at Bahrein on behalf of the ex-Sheikh Abdullah the general question of policy was considered by Her Majesty’s Government in the early part of 1844 in the light of an intimation by the Government of India that they would see the strongest objections to any such interference by Persia, which' could not but react adversely on British interests. As a result, Her Majesty’s Minister was informed (Foreign Office Despatch to Tehran, No. 23, dated'lst May, 1844) that the question of the right of Persia to interfere and of the Indian Government to prevent interference necessarily depends upon the validity of the pretension put forward by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein. Her Majesty’s Govern ment are ignorant of the grounds of such pretension, and, assuming those grounds to be insufficient, they would claim for the British Government the right to prevent, if it accorded with its policy to do so, any direct interposition of Persia m the quarrels of rival claimants to the possession of Bahrein. The British Government in India at present consider that any such disturbance as may be occasioned by military operations on the part of Persia directed against the island of Bahrein would be injurious to British interests, and, therefore, unless r t* 1 l 08:11 s ^ ow s ^ e ^ as a c l ear an d indisputable right to the sovereignty °h q? . ^ n; that she has exercised it without interruption under the dynasty of the Kajar family; that consequently her present policy is directed to the main tenance of her lawful claims and not to the assertion of a pretension not founded on law, she must be prepared to encounter in any scheme of this kind the active opposition of the British Government in India.” In these circumstances the Minister was instructed to inform the Persian Government that “ Her Majesty’s Government had heard with regret that that Government contemplated taking part m the disputes respecting the Government of Bahrein; that such a proceeding would be viewed with much jealousy by the British Government in India; and that unless the right of Persia to interfere in the matter is beyond dispute, any interference on her part might lead to unpleasant discussions with England’. For, although Her Majesty’s Government do not dispute the right of Persia as an independent Power to adopt any line of policy not inconsistent with its engagements to foreign States which she might think advantageous to herself, they claim for themselves a corresponding right to judge and act in such matters as they may think fit.” 85—177 t f!i Teh.

The following extract, which (except as regards the initial date) appears correctly to represent the true tacts, may. however, be placed on record from the Prime Minister’s memorandum : “ In the commencement of the reign of His Majesty the late Shah, the Arabs of Beni Attabi came f rom the desert and conquered the island by sea. I he object and desire of the Persian Government has since always been and is the recovery of that island from its spoilers.” 49.* Her Majesty’s Government, in view T of the unlikelihood that Persia had, or could give effect to, any serious designs in Bahrein and the undesirability of engaging in those circumstances in a correspondence which might merely^ cause irritation without serving any useful purpose, instructed the Minister at Tehran not to revert to the subject unless it was forced upon him by the Persian Prime Minister. In that case he was to employ certain arguments supplied to him (apparently the critical comments of the Secret Committee of the East India Company on the Prime Minister’s memorandum) to show generally the grounds on which Her Majesty’s Government were cc unable to recognise as valid the claims advanced by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein, and you may add 2 ( 2 ) On this point the Secret Committee of the East India Company remarked: “Presents and complimentary messages do not imply an acknowledgment of sovereignty, and they have not been confined to Persia.” (Secret Committee to India Board, 31st July, 1845.)13 r a xij that they would ... . very much disapprove of any attempts on the Dart of Persia to interfere m the affarrs of that island and thus disturb the peace of the Gulf and to afford an opening to piracy ” The „ P eac , e ot dropped for the time being P question appears to have Treaty of Peace with Wahabis, to whom Bahrein pays Tribute (1847) 50.

In 1849 the ex-Sheikh died. Bushire to Tehran, No. 177 of 5.6.1848. Views of Her Majesty’s Government on Future Policy, 1847-49 The overtures made by the Turks in 1847 gave rise between 1847 and k° consideration by the Government of Bombay, the Government of India, TE s Government of the policy to be adopted in regard to Bahrein! Ihe Sheikh hinted in 1847 that unless certain grievances were met he might Lor i 881 become a Turkish subject. His grievances were accordingly remedied by the Bo. to’ Res, Covernment of Bombay. That Government represented, however, that it was 334 of desirable to exclude interference in Gulf affairs by foreign Powers, since unless ’ ’ Her Majesty’s Government retained the supreme control they could not secure the permanence of the objects (the suppression of piracy, &amp;c.) on which so much money had been spent. The Court of Directors concurred in the Government of Bombay’s recommendation “ that any attempts upon Bahrein ought to be resisted by the^ British Naval Force ” and that the Resident should be so informed. 55. On 11th October, 1847, the Foreign Office, in a letter to the India Board, m which they referred to recent Turkish assurances that the Turkish Govern- h a d no intention of using compulsion with regard to Bahrein, added that if the Indian Government has any further apprehensions on the subject, and if the Bahrein Chief is really an independent ruler, the best course would be to make with him a treaty of alliance which would secure his independence and his friendly connection with England.” The Resident, who deemed it inexpedient that Her Majesty’s Government should involve itself in the embarrassments likely to arise from a closer alliance with Bahrein (letter of 25th January, 1848), was, however, opposed to making the existing connection closer, as were the Secret Committee of the East India Company, who expressed the view that theLor.

Muscat was dissuaded from attacking Bahrein m 1849. , . Her Majesty’s Government, on consideration of the policy to he adopted m regard to Bahrein, decided against establishing a protectorate and refused a request put forward in 1849 by the Sheikh to be taken under British protection. Thev assured him at the same time of their general goodwill, and their deliberations made it clear that they regarded the island as independent, but were reluctant to assume further responsibility in relation to it so .pf independence and the performance of the engagements undertaken by the bhemh could be secured without their doing so. YIL—1850 64 Disputes with Wahabis, 1850-51 60. In 1850 the Resident found it necessary to take disciplinary action against the ruling Sheikh—an individual of “ irresponsible character. Conse quent on strained relations between the Sheikh and the Wahabi Amir, the Amir, with whom the sons of the ex-Sheikh Abdullah were associated, in 1850~ci threatened Bahrein, whereupon the Sheikh “ against his own better judgment. . tendered a small annual tribute to the Amir,” a circumstance from which it mav perhaps be inferred that he had failed to observe the agreement of 1847 referred to in paragraph 50 above. The Amir rejected the offer and made exorbitant demands instead. The Sheikh was about to succumb to a combination of the sons of the ex-Sheikh and the Wahabi Amir “ when a British squadron arriving off Bahrein took the islands under their protection.' Peace was subse quently made with the Wahabis in July 1851. Her Majesty’s Government and the Claims of Turkey (1851) 61. In the same year Her Majesty’s Government decided that the Turkish Government should be informed at Constantinople that Her Majesty’s Govern ment, having heard that the Sheikh was desirous of placing himself under15 f Turkish protection, could not acknowledge or acquiesce in any such arrangement seeing that the Government of British India had had relations with Bahrein as StatG and h / d conclude 1 d Wltd ^ certain treaties, namely, one in lc20 for t e suppression of piracy and one in 1847 for the prohibition of the exportation of slaves, and that Her Majesty’s Government must object to anv ai i angement which would transfer Bahrein to the dominion or protectorshin of any other Power. r F 6 ?‘ J In - t r he C0rres P 0 4 ldeilce leading up to this decision Lord Palmerston remarked : I come to the conclusion that it is the opinion of the East India Company that the object first to be aimed at is to prevent Bahrein from falling 1 under the control of any foreign Power, and to keep that island in its present condition of political independence. But I infer from what has been stated in the despatches which you have communicated to me, that if that independence could no longer be maintained, and if the ruler and the people of Bahrein were determined to place themselves under some foreign protection, the East India Company would think that less evil would arise from affording to Bahrein British protection than from allowing French, Persian or Turkish authoritv to be established in that island.” ^ Attitude of the Wahabis and of Muscat, 1852-53 63. In 1852 the Sheikh proposed to withhold his tribute from the Wahabi Amir, but on the advice of the Resident decided to pay it. In the same year the Consul at Zanzibar was instructed to inform the Imam of Muscat that Her Majesty’s Government saw no reason to alter the views regarding the possession of Bahrein communicated to His Highness in 1849 (paragraph 58 above). In May 1853 the Government of India authorised the Government of Bombay to offer every obstacle to an attack on Bahrein by the Wahabi Amir (who was now nominally subject to the Turkish Government) on the ground that Her Majesty’s Government would not permit the occupation of Bahrein by the Turkish Govern ment or by anyone acting for them or in their interest. Principle of Non-Interference in Internal Affairs laid down by Bombay Government (1854) 64. On 20th November, 1854, the Government of Bombay in a letter to the Resident laid down the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of Bahrein, and authorised the Resident simultaneously to inform the Sheikh of Qatif on the Arab mainland that the British Government would not tolerate his further interference with the affairs of Bahrein. Slavery Agreement with Her Majesty’s Government (1856) 65. On 10th May, 1856, an agreement supplementary to the Treaty of 1847 (paragraph 51 above) regarding the slave trade was made with the Sheikh. Its contents were identical with that of corresponding engagements entered into at the same time by the Arab rulers of the Trucial Coast. 66. The Sheikh’s internal government continued to go from bad to worse. In September 1858 reparation was secured from him for the ill-treatment of British subjects in Bahrein. In 1859 a Wahabi attack was averted by British intervention. The local Wahabi Governor sued for pardon to the Senior Naval Officer; the Wahabi ruler, however, made a formal protest, asserted his authority over Bahrein, and declared that he was himself a vassal of the Sultan of Turkey. The Resident, in reply, informed him of the determination of Her Majesty’s Government to preserve the independence of Bahrein, and pointed out the incon sistency of his piratical attacks on Turkish shipping with his professions of dependence on the Ottoman Government. Sheikh’s Appeal to Persia and Turkey, 1859-61 67. At the end of 1859 or early in 1860, as the result, apparently, partly of apprehensions of the Wahabis and partly of irritation at the restraint exercised by the Resident over his piratical activities directed against the Wahabis, the Sheikh made a simultaneous appeal for assistance to the Persian Governor of Ears and the Turkish Wali of Bagdad. The Turkish answer was delayed. A Persian agent (Mirza Mehdi Khan), bearing a Persian Firman to the Sheikh, arrived in April 1860. The Persian flag was hoisted, Persian sovereignty proclaimed, and the Sheikh’s agreement to pay tribute secured. These ceremonies were, however, scarcely over when a Turkish emissary arrived.

Views of the Minister at Tehran and the Government of Bombay 68. The Minister at Tehran regarded the matter as one of relatively small importance. He pointed out to the Persian Government “ that under no circum stances can the British Government be expected to concur m the proposed transfer of the sovereignty of Bahrein to the Persian Grown, since we have contracted engagements with the Arab Sheikhs of the island as independent Chiefs, and since the maintenance of their independence is indispensable to the successful working of those plans of maritime police in the Persian Gulf which we have been at so much pains and expense to establish ; and obtained an assurance from Persia that no military occupation of Bahrein should be attempted until the title to the island had been settled through the diplomatic channel. He advised the Resident that, while hostilities against Bahrein were to be repelled by force, a voluntary tender of allegiance by the Sheikh to any other Power might, so long as it was unaccompanied by any military occupation, be ignored as of no particular importance. In the light of the Minister’s views the Government of Bombay instructed the Resident that he should not interfere with the occupation of Bahrein, whether by Persia or Turkey, save by protest and by an intimation that the matter had been referred to Her Majesty’s Government; but at the same time that the agents of both Powders (Turkey and Persia) should be warned that aggression by or in the name of Bahrein on neigh bouring tribes would not be allowed and would, if necessary, be prevented by force. In representing the matter to the Secretary of State for India they urged that in the interests of the peace of the Gulf it would be better that Bahrein should be regarded as independent and as subject neither to Turkey nor to Persia, that its independence should be recognised, and the engagements into which in the interests of humanity we had entered with its rulers for the preser vation of the peace and good order of the Gulf should be maintained. Her Majesty’s Government decide that Bahrein shall be regarded as Independent (1861) 69. In February 1861 Her Majesty’s Government, after discussion between the India Office and the Foreign Office, approved the recommendation of the Government of Bombay. The Resident and the Minister at Tehran were so informed. During part of the time at any rate that the question was under consideration in London the Turkish and Persian agents or their representatives appear (though it is not clear how consistently) to have remained in Bahrein, and the flags of both Powers to have been flown simultaneously. On 27th February, 1861, the Political Resident reported that “ the Persian and Turkish flags still fly on the forts of the island and in an interview that Commander Cruttenden had with Sheikh Md. bin Khahfah at his own request he (the Chief) remarked in respect to them that they were displayed ‘ merely to suit his own fancy. What did he care for Turk or Persian ? He valued ^ the friendship of the British Government highly.’ ” British Convention of 31st May, 1861, with the Sheikh /0. In May 1861 the Sheikh, refusing to discontinue a blockade which he had imposed on the vVahabi coast, was informed by the Resident of the decision of Her Majesty s Government that he was regarded as an independent Chief and that in these circumstances he must be held responsible by them for any piratical activities in which he might indulge. The Sheikh proved obdurate; he was threatened with forcible measures by the Resident and two of his ships were seized. He accordingly submitted, and on 31st May, 1861, he signed a Friendly with the Resident, acting on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government, by which ne entered into a perpetual treaty of peace and friendship ” with Great Li itam, and m which, as independent ruler of Bahrein, he acknowledged as17 valid and in force the earlier conventions entered into between Bahrein and Her Majesty’s Government, and undertook in return for a guarantee of protection against aggressions ££ by the Chiefs and Tribes of the Gulf” to abstain from maritime aggression, piracy, the slave trade, &amp;c., and to agree to certain Aitchison, conditions in regard to residence and trade in Bahrein by British subjects and to Na'x^k. jurisdiction over them. One of the ships seized from him was thereupon returned; the second, the Hamrah, was retained. 71. The Turkish and Persian agents would seem to have disappeared from P oL Res- to Bahrein before the Resident’s arrival. The Persian authorities at Bushire in 8 . 61861 °' 20 June 1861 asked the Resident for an explanation of his proceedings. The Resident, however, contented himself with forwarding their enquiry to Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. The Convention was approved by the Government of India in 1861, and the Turkish and Persian Governments were informed of what had happened. Summary, 1850-61 72. The Turkish Government were informed in 1851 that Her Majesty’s Government could not recognise any claim on their part to Bahrein. The Sheikhs appear to have continued to pay tribute to the Wahabi Amir in the early part of and possibly throughout this period. In 1859 the Sheikh appealed simultaneously to Turkey and to Persia, as the result of apprehensions of a Wahabi attack, and received a Persian envoy, who hoisted the Persian flag. On the arrival immediately afterwards of the Turkish envoy the Persian flag was hauled down. Subsequently the Sheikh for a time flew both flags side by side. The envoys seem to have left Bahrein in the early part of 1861. No action was taken by the British authorities pending a decision by Her Majesty’s Government as to whether they regarded Bahrein as independent. The Persian Government undertook not to endeavour to occupy the islands until the title to them was settled. Her Majesty’s Government decided in February 1861 to regard the Sheikh as an independent ruler and so hold him responsible for piracies, &amp;c. Punitive action against him by Her Majesty’s Government having proved necessary in May 1861, he entered in that month into a convention with them in which he was described as ££ independent ruler of Bahrein,” and secured certain guarantees of protection. YIII.—1861-67. From the Convention of 1861 to the Punitive Expedition of August 1868 Persian Protest (1862) 73. In January 1862 the Persian Minister in Paris protested to Her ^ 0 or p ^ owley Majesty’s Ambassador in Paris against the seizure of the Hamrah. He was No. is,’ informed in reply that Her Majesty’s Government could not recognise any claim on the part of Persia to question their proceedings in regard to Bahrein, and must Lord Cowley, therefore decline to offer him any explanation on the subject of his complaint. 22 ° 2 .i 862 . Persian Protest (1866) 74. Between 1863 and 1865 the Sheikh continued to misbehave, and in the Lor. i, 891. latter year his ship, the Dinar, was seized under the instructions of the Resident. The Persian Government in 1866 made a complaint in regard to the Dinar proceedings on the ground that Bahrein under the unratified agreement of 1822 was a dependency of Persia. The Government of India, after ascertaining from the Government of Bombay the nature of the agreement of 1822, communicated Lor - b 691 - the result of their enquiries to the Minister at Tehran, and added their own opinion that ££ whatever might have been the pretensions of Persia or the grounds of the same to the sovereignty of Bahrein in former days, the Shah could not now be regarded as possessing in point of fact any rights in the principality.” This to G. of i. communication was approved by Her Majesty’s Government in the same year, and 28.2.1867. the matter appears to have dropped. Nature of Relations between Bahrein and Wahabi Amir (1867) 75. In 1866-67 the Resident, on the instructions of the Government of India, investigated the relations of the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Wahabi Amir. He reported as a result that the Sheikh claimed to be independent so far as his islands 85—177 DLor. I, 892 were concerned, and that the annual tribute of 4,000 dollars whic.i he indubitably paid '(cv. paragraph 50 above) to the Amir was on account or the possessions held by him in Qatar on the Arabian mainland, the object of the payment being to secure those possessions against attacks by Arab tiibes under Vahabi influence. The Government of India, in the light of the Resident s investigation, expressed the view in March 1867 that the Sheikh was independent of all other Powers in respect of his insular possessions and owed fealty to the W ahabis only in regard to Qatar. Summary, 1861-67 76. This period is marked by assertions of the Persian claim in 1862 and 1866. Her Majesty’s Government on both occasions made it clear that they could not regard that claim as well founded. Investigation showed that the tribute still paid (1867) by the Sheikh to the Wahabi Amir was in respect of Bahreini possessions on the mainland of Arabia, and not in respect of Bahrein, which the Sheikh held independently of all other Powers. IX.—Discussions and Incidents, 1868-70 77. Questions of considerable importance as bearing on the status of Bahrein arose in 1868-70 consequent on— (a) the disciplinary action taken by the Government of India against the ruling Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa, in view of his breaches of the Maritime Truce of 1820, which resulted in his flight from Bahrein in September in 1868 and the succession as sole Sheikh of his brother, Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa; (b) the punitive action taken at Bahrein by the Government of India in November-December 1869, consequent on the invasion of Bahrein by the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa, the murder of Sheikh Ali and the attempt of Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa and Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah to establish themselves in control of the islands. 78. In view of the weight attached by the Persians to the declarations made in the course of those discussions as indicating the view held by Her Majesty’s Government on the status of Bahrein, of the Persian allegations that overtures to Persia had been made by the ruling Sheikh, Ali bin Khalifa, and by the ex- Sheikh, Md. bin Khalifa, and of the misleading but categorical accusations made against the Resident by the Persian Government, it seems desirable to examine in some detail the correspondence which passed and the sequence of events.

In 1868, consequent on an attack on Qatar by the Sheikh of Bahrein, the Government of India resolved to take disciplinary action against Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa. The Sheikh sent an agent to Bushire to satisfy the Resident, but the agent having no powers from his master, his mission proved fruitless, and he returned to Bahrein in August 1868. An armed expedition was thereupon sent against the Sheikh in August—September of that year. Before it reached Bahrein the Sheikh fled to the Arab mainland, and he was thereafter regarded by the people of Bahrein and by Her Majesty’s Government as having abdicated the Sheikhdom. The expedition found it unnecessary to use any force, y.— 881011 , k e * n &amp; made on its arrival by Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa, brother of Sheikh Mohamed, who had previously been associated with Sheikh Mohamed to some extent in the Sheikhship. An agreement was reached by the Political Resident with Sheikh Ah, which disposed of the matters in dispute, on 6th September, 1868. The agreement was signed by “Ali bin Khalifah and the inhabitants and subjects oi Bahrein. It declared inter alia that “ Md. bin Khalil ah having repeatedly committed acts of piracy and other irregularities at sea ana having now after his recent piratical acts, fled from Bahrein, has forfeited all claim to his title as principal Sheikh and Chief of Bahrein ’” 80. Subsequently to the conclusion of this agreement the Resident, by way of punishment destroyed the fort of Muharraq by gunfire and burnt certain vessels of war belonging to Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifah. His despatch whidh contains a detailed report on the course of events, makes no reference to any flyingof the Persian flag by Mohamed bin Khalifah, and the bombardment of Muharraq and the punitive destruction of the warships took place after the submission of Bahrein, and so after Mohamed bin Khalifah had fled from the islands. Persian Protest, November 1868 81. The facts appear to be as stated in the preceding paragraph. It was some time before a full account of these proceedings reached either India or London. Meanwhile, as will be seen from the correspondence, extracts of which Teh. Deep, to are quoted below, the action of the Government of India drew a vigorous protest Aloises from the Persian Government. The protest, after appealing to the treaties con- Teh Desp eluded between England and Persia in 1809, in 1814, in 1822 (unratified) and in ^9 of 1857, urged that the Resident, instead of respecting the rights of Persia in the i71118ba ' Gulf to the extent provided for in those treaties had, without any prior intimation to the Persian authorities, attacked Bahrein, which island had been and still was the property of Persia; had bombarded and destroyed the Governor’s fort and house and caused considerable damage; had appointed the Sheikh’s brother as Governor over the island on the flight, through fear, of the Sheikh; had imposed a fine; and had required the new Sheikh to find his brother and deliver him up to the British authorities. These proceedings had taken place at a time when “ Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah, the Governor of Bahrein, was openly avowing his submission to and dependence upon Persia and declaring that he considered Bahrein to be indisputably Persian, in proof of which the Persian flag was flying over his fort.” 82. Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran was instructed to communicate a f.o. to i.o., suitable explanatory statement to the Persian Government. The Foreign Office 1 - 21869 - suggested, however, that it might be advisable, in the event of similar proceedings again becoming necessary, that communication should be had with that Govern ment. While this question was still under consideration a formal protest against the Resident’s action was received (11th February, 1869,) from the Persian Charg6 d’Affaires in London, who complained, inter alia, that the Resident had sunk three ships belonging to the Governor of Bahrein and fired on his Palace on which the Persian flag flew, and requested that the British Government would give orders ii° 2 .i 869 . an ’ for the repair of the damage caused. He was informed in reply that tc the Sheikh JJ Khan of Bahrein was an independent chief with whom the British Government had s.sisS. a ’ treaty engagements and whom they must hold strictly to the performance of those engagements.” 83. This contention the Persian representative disputed, and in support of |^ n ^ h jj“ ke his view he forwarded letters addressed “ from 1858 to 1869 by the Sheikh of 0 f Argyll, Bahrein to His Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Prince Governor of Shiraz.” 134.1869. The translations of these letters are dated 9th April and 12th April, 1869, respectively. From internal evidence it seems probable that they were, however, written in 1860 on the occasion of the visit to Bahrein of the Persian envoy, Mirza Medhi Khan (paragraph 67 above). They acknowledge the receipt of a Firman from the Mirza (apparently recognising Sheikh Md. as Sheikh and accompanying a Firman and a Sword of Honour for Sheikh Ali). They state emphatically that Bahrein forms part of Persia, and has always done so. They refer to an agreement reached for the future payment of tribute; remark that £C the slight neglect which was lately shown on our part towards Your Imperial Majesty’s Government was because they had not for a while superintended and protected us, but as now the Government of Your Imperial Majesty has intended by sending over Mirza Mehdy to enquire into and manage the affairs here, I, with my brother and all the inhabitants, feel quite ready to declare at once that we are most willing to render any services required from us towards Your Majesty’s Goverment,^being already aware that Bahrein (Persian Gulf) is part of Persia,” and add £C . . I will hasten to hoist the flag on my residence bearing the Lion and the Sun which are the signs of the Persian Standard.” British Note of 29th April, 1869 84. The question of the reply to be given to this further protest was carefully considered between the India Office and the Foreign Office. The Duke of Argyll, then Secretary of State for India, remarked that although he was of opinion that the line of policy which had hitherto been pursued of regarding the Sheikh of Bahrein as an independent sovereign, and of refusing to recognise the right of sovereignty advanced by Persia, as had been done in 1845, 1848 and 1860, could not be now abandoned without very serious risk of endangering the peace of the Gulf, yet that £ £ he was not blind to the expediency of avoiding all causes 85—177 I.O. to F.O., 21.4.1869.

The Foreign Office concurred in these views and the Persian representative was informed accordingly. 85. The Persian representative on receipt of the Foreign Qfhce letter asked that in order to make it more palatable to the k&gt;hah, certain modifications should be made in it. After private discussion between Lord Clarendon and the Duke of Argyll, of which no record exists, and an interview between the Envoy and Lord Clarendon, it was finally agreed to accept the modification embodied in the opening paragraph of the letter which follows, but also to make the addition contained in the last paragraph of that letter; and a letter so amended was despatched to him. The text (omitting an introductory paragraph) of the amended letter, which is of importance as one of the principal pieces of evidence subsequently adduced by the Persian Government in support of their claim that Her Majesty’s Government have recognised Persian sovereignty oyer Bahrein, is as follows. The sentences in italics are those which were added in deference to the further representations from General Mohsin Khan referred to above :— “ The British Government readily admit that the Government of the Shah has protested against the Persian right of sovereignty over Bahrein being ignored by the British Authorities, and they have given due consideration to that protest. But it is the fact, as yourself and the Government of the Shah are undoubtedly aware, that the Sheikhs of Bahrein have at different periods entered directly into engagements with the British Government ; and I beg to assure you that the British Government hold the Sheikh to these engage ments solely for the purposes of preventing Piracy and Slave Trade, and of maintaining the police of the Gulf. If the Persian Government are prepared to keep a sufficient force in the Gulf for these purposes, this country would be relieved of a troublesome and costly duty; but, if the Shah is not prepared to undertake these duties, Her Majesty’s Government cannot suppose His Majesty would wish that in those waters disorder and crimes should be encouraged by impunity. “ I need scarcely assure you of the friendly feelings entertained by Her Majesty’s Government towards Persia, and their desire on all occasions to meet as far as possible the wishes of the Shah; and, in regard to this question, I have the honour to state to you that, whenever it is practicable to do so, Her Majesty’s Government will cause the Persian Government to be informed beforehand of any measures of coercion against himself which the conduct of the Sheikh of Bahrein may have rendered necessary. “ But the British Government cannot consent to debar its officers, to whom the superintendence of the police of the Persian Gulf is entrusted, from the exercise of the right of punishing by prompt measures any violation of Treaty engagements by the Sheikh of Bahrein, when a reference to the Court of Tehran would be attended with embarrassing delays which might endanger the general peace of the Gulf; but whenever such a necessity shall arise a full communication respecting it shall be made to the Persian Government.” Overthrow and Death of Sheikh AH {August-September 1869) 86. In August—September 1869 Bahrein was invaded by the ex-Sheikh Mohammed bin Khali lab, who was joined by one Mohammed bin Abdullah, son of the Sheikh who had been deposed in 1843 (paragraph 39 above). The ruling Sheikh Ali was defeated and killed, while Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdullah assumed the leadership of the usurping party. 87. Her Majesty’s Minister reported on 14th November, 1869, a. conversation on this incident with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs in the course of which the latter admitted that Persia had not acquired sufficient power or authority in that part of the Gulf to enable her to repress acts of piracy and to21 «» maintain oid-Br, bnt added that he hoped that before long the Shah s authority would be fully established at Bahrein, when full redress would be given for losses suffered through the recent events, and that in the meanwhile it would not be con sidered necessaiy that the British authorities should undertake coercive measures Her Majesty’s Minister further reported that cc Ali bin Khalifa having fowarded letters to this court admitting his allegiance to the Shah and offering his services to the Persian Government,” an agent (Mirza Medhi Khan, who had been Persian Envoy to Bahrein in 1859 (paragraph 67 above)) had been despatched with a ioyal Firman, recognising Sheikh Ali bin Khalifah as Chief of Bahrein, but that on receipt of the news of the murder of the Sheikh by the ex-Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifah, the Firman had been recalled and the name of the ex-Sheikh substituted (from paragraphs 94-5 below it will be seen that these statements subsequently proved to be incorrect in material particulars). British Punitive Expedition (November December 1869) 88. Punitive operations consequent on the murder of Sheikh Ali were undertaken by the British Government in November of the same year. Previous notification was given to the Persian Government of the grounds of this expedition, the object of which was stated to be “to call the chief now in possession of Bahrein to account for his breach of the maritime peace and for the attack on Sheikh Ali bin Khalifah, who had been placed in power by the British Government.” 89. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on receipt of the notification in question stated that the ex-Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifah, who had, he said, been the cause of the recent disturbances, had been killed (this was in fact incorrect); that the Resident’s action would therefore be useless, and that the Persian Government hoped that he would be telegraphically instructed not to proceed to Bahrein. He added that the Persian Government would themselves keep the affairs of Bahrein by land in order and that should anything happen to affect its affairs by sea they would request the British Government to send a naval force to put affairs in order, ‘ ‘ but up till now the state of affairs in Bahrein had not fallen into disorder.” 90. The Persian agent referred to in paragraph 87 above, arriving in the Gulf at this stage, addressed letters to Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdullah (see paragraph 86 above) intimating his recognition as Sheikh, and despatched them by a special messenger, who proceeded to the island in a native boat belonging to a Persian. The messenger was, however, on his arrival prevented by the Resident from landing or communicating with the Sheikh, and his letters were detained and ultimately handed by the Resident to Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdullah after the submission of that Sheikh, who returned them to Colonel Pelly after perusal. The messenger stated that he had himself no authority from the Shah’s Government and was deputed by the Chief of Payer, who was acting in obedience to Mirza Mehdi Khan. Submission of Usurping Sheikhs Sheikh Isa bin Ali becomes Sheikh 91. The punitive operations against Bahrein resulted in the complete submission of Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah and the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Kalifah in September 1869. It may be remarked that prior to the opening of operations Sheikh Abdullah made overtures to the Resident, which were, however, rejected, with a view to securing recognition by Her Majesty’s Government. He also appealed to the Wahabi Amir for recognition and protection. Sheikh Isa bin Ali, son of the murdered Sheikh Ali, voluntarily assumed the vacant Chiefship and was recognised by the Resident on behalf of the Government of India ( t£ in no way did Colonel Pelly influence the succession ”) and the ex-Sheikh and Mohammed bin Abdullah were deported to India. Shortly after his installation the new Sheikh received a letter from one Hydar Khan, Zabit of the Dashti district on the Persian coast, advising him to place himself under the Shah’s protection, but the incident appears to have been unimportant. Persian Protest, 1869-70 Views of Government of India 92.

But he protest^ m strong terms against the Resident's action in prevent n ^d a™stinger p“^ w^ “ade by th! communication with the bheikh ana a sun suon^ci p P ,vh an stive Persian Minister in London. The Government of India m the exhaustive reports they submitted on the Resident’s action, urged, after a review of the history of the islands, that the Shah had no legitimate control over the sheikh of Bahrein: that his Government had, nevertheless, encouraged ihe piratical fqoiinn in the Persian Gulf bv sending letters of recognition to the piratical leader; that in styling Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah Chief of Bahmn the Persian Government ignored the facts that he had never held sway in Bahrein, belonged to the younger branch of the ruling family and so had neither by right nor possession cfaim to this title: and that, so far from the Shah having any just cause of complaint against the Resident, the Persian Government should be called upon to give some explanation of the conduct ot its officeis in encouraging a piratical expedition which was prejudicial to British interests m the Persian Gulf and for the successive appointment by them of Ah bin Khalifa and Md. bin Khalifa to the sovereignty of a district over which they haa no legitimate control. The Government of India added that they had no confirmation of the alleged overtures of Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa to Persia (paragraph 87 above), as to which further enquirv was being made of Her Majesty’s Minister (see paragraphs 94- 95 below), but m any event could not admit c ‘ that such overtures, made without its knowledge and consent, can in any way affect its treaty relations with Bahrein.’’ British Reply to Persia, March 1870 93. Her Majesty’s Minister was therefore instructed by the Foreign Office that it appeared possible that Her Majesty’s Government, instead of furnishing explanations to Persia, might have cause to complain of the proceedings of the Persian authorities in endeavouring to communicate with a piratical chief who had been guilty of a breach of the Maritime Truce, and who had attacked the Chief placed in power at Bahrein by the British Government,’ and was informed that no notice would be taken of the complaints against the Resident until the Persian Government gave a full explanation of the intercepted letters. Supplementary Reports by Her Majesty's Minister, Teln % an, April 1870 94. On 6th April, 1870, the Minister at Tehran reported as follows to the Government of India :— “ In my Despatch No. 81. ... I reported that the Firman of appoint ment was originally in the name of Ali bin Khalifa, but that, on hearing of his death, it was altered in favour of his brother, Md. bin Khalifa. This information had reached me from a relation of . . . one of the principal Persian officials in Shiraz, and not . . . from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. When further intelligence reached Shiraz from the Gulf and it was supposed that Md. bin Abdullah would retain possession of Bahrein, the Firman was probably again altered in his favour, as it was to him that it was eventually forwarded. In conversation with the Persian Minister this afternoon, His Excellency admitted that this was probably the case. He said that Mirza Mehdi Khan on leaving Tehran had received general instructions for his guidance respecting the Bahrein question, but that the details were settled at Shiraz and the Firman was issued in the name of the Persian Governor of Pars and not in that of the Shah. The name inserted in this document had certainly, he said, been altered once to his knowledge, and it was not unlikely that it had been changed a second time before being forwarded to its destination. “ With regard to the overtures said to have been made by Ali bin Khalifa to the Persian Government, as reported in my Despatch No. 81, I have the honour to state that that information also reached pie from a private source and not from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. His Excel lency has, however, asserted very positively to me to-day that Ali bin Khalifa had repeatedly written to the Persian Government professing allegiance to the Shah and that a number of letters containing assurances of this kind are now in his (the Minister's) possession. “ It appears to me that on the receipt of a correspondence which passed last April between Her Majesty’s Government and the Shah’s representative23 100 “ r’S'r dX'? S“tad S“f T' ch ”' W “ ‘r make good h 1S claim to exercise sovereign rights over Bahrein Mirza Metidi Khan was accordingly dispatched to Shiraz and Bushire and a certain latitude was given to him as to the mode in which he shou d nrocccH to carry out the wishes of his Government The Persian fl ,?ihnrS^ - d Shiraz finally determined that a Firman should be addressed to Md l” 1 L conferring upon him the government of Bahrein and with this the Khan hoped to be able to come to terms with the Chief then in possession of the place. But m this matter the sole object of all concerned would seem to have been to carry out the policy of the Persian Government at BahreS Tn thTt quarter ” 6 mtereStS ° r WisheS ° f Her Ma j est y’* Government despatch toVTaov^rnmenlVtod^^' a ‘ Tehran addreSSed the followin &amp; reference to my despatch of the 6th instant, in which I stated that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed me that Ali bin Khalifa had repeatedly made overtures to Persia admitting his allegiance to the Shah, I have the honour to report to Your Excellency that Mirza Saved Khan has just sent to inform me that he was mistaken in making this assertion and that he finds on enquiry that the letters to which he referred were not from that Chief, but from Md. bin Khalifa.” Views of Government of India, May 1870 tvt ^ overn ^ rien t of India, commenting on these facts, remarked that Mehdi Khan appeared to have left Tehran with a general discretion as to which of the various Sheikhs should be recognised as ruler. “At the capital no more dehmte plan appears to have been resolved on than that measures should be adopted to establish the Sheikh’s assumed right of sovereignty over the island.” 97. The Government of India proceeded that they had already pointed out that any disposition to admit the claims of Persia would probably lead to the revival of similar claims on the part of Turkey, a result which had in fact now been brought about (cp. paragraph 99 below). “ This (i.e., the Turkish) claim rests on no better foundation than that of Persia. It was summarily rejected by Lord Palmerston in 1851 and in our opinion should not again be reopened. With equal reason the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan of Muscat could claim the sovereignty of the island, if the nominal and temporary tender of allegiance, in times of difficulty, and as a security against foreign intervention, be considered sufficient ground on which to base such pretensions. On the same ground indeed we might claim Bahrein as a part of the British dominions. But, as we have repeatedly observed, the real status of the island, and the only one which we have recognised and admitted, or are prepared to recognise and admit, in all our dealings in the Persian Gulf and our negotiations with the Chiefs, is that of an independent State, subject neither to Persia nor to Turkey, neither to the g. of i. Wahabis nor to Muscat, nor yet to the British Government. No - 28 °* Review of Discussions of 1868-70 98. The matter ultimately lapsed. But from the facts and the correspon dence summarised above it will be seen, in the first place, that there appears to be no foundation for the alleged overtures to Persia by the ruling Sheikh, Ali bin Khalifa, or for the statement that the Persian flag was flying at the time of the punitive expedition of 1868; and that if any overtures were made to Persia m 1868-69 (and there is no confirmatory evidence of any such overtures) they would appear to have been made by the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa, presumably m his anxiety to secure Persian support for his restoration. Secondly, while the statements contained in the Note sent by the Foreign Office on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government to the Persian Charge d’Affaires on 29th April, 1869, were widely phrased, and afford some justification for the interpretation placed on them by Persia, and while the Persians may have been confirmed in their view by the absence of any protest by Her Majesty’s Minister against the mission of Mirza Mehdi Khan, the terms of that Note do not, in fact, constitute more than a recognition that Persia had in the past repeatedly pressed her claim to Bahrein, and that Her Majesty’s Government did not claim sovereignty over that island Desp.24 X, 1870-80.

British Assurances to Bahrei/n, 1871 100. In 1871 the Turks occupied Hasa. Protests at Constantinople in April and May 1871 against rumoured Turkish designs on Bahrein resulted m a repudiation by Turkey of any such designs. The assurances received from the Turkish Government were communicated to the Sheikh ol Bahrein, who ha a asked Her Majesty’s Government for their advice and their protection against Lor. 1,902. the Turks in May 1871, and he was informed that so long as he observed the provisions of the Convention of 1861 (paragraph 70 above) the reciprocal obliga tions towards him of Great Britain would be fulfilled. . .. 101. Protests about the same time at Constantinople led to a lurkish Lor. i, 919. repudiation of the designs which the Turkish Government were alleged to have entertained at Bahrein, and the Turkish authorities in Hasa were given instructions by their Government which debarred them from approaching Bahrein. In May 1871 the Shah enquired from Her Majesty’s Representative at Tehran as to the' probable effect on Bahrein of the Turkish occupation of Hasa and was informed in reply of the assurances which had been given to Her Majesty’s Government by the Turks. Refly to Persian Legation at Constantinople as to meaning of British Note of April 1869 102. In November 1871 the Secretary of the Persian Legation at Constan tinople made enquiries of Her Majesty’s Ambassador in connection with a rumour that a Turkish expedition was to be sent for the reduction of Bahrein, which island the Persian Secretary stated had been acknowledged by the Hertsiet. 28. British Government as a portion of the Persian dominions and . . . in proof of C p. g. of i. this assertion he had handed to Sir H. Elliott a copy of the note which Lord Clarendon addressed to General Haji Mohsin Khan on 28th April, 1869. Sir H. Elliott, however, observed that he saw in that note nothing more than an acknowledgment that the claim had previously been made, but that he was unwilling to discuss the point, as he believed there was no danger of any attempt being made to interfere with the position of Bahrein as it then stood.” Turkish Claims, 1871-79 103. Consequent on the murder of a Turkish messenger in Bahrein in August or September 1871, the Turkish Government demanded reparation direct from the Sheikh and received a conciliatory reply. On their demand being pressed the Sheikh, on the advice of the Resident, suggested that the matter be arranged between the British and the Turkish Governments, by whose joint decision he would abide, but the Turkish Government preferred that it should be settled direct by the parties by agents. Her Majesty’s Government saw no objection to such a procedure so long as no compulsion or show of force by Turkey was involved. The Turks, however, let the matter drop. The incident is of some interest asillustrating the view taken by Her Majesty’s Government of the Sheikh as an independent ruler who might deal direct with foreign Powers. , In -^ n S l,s t 1872, a further complaint having been received from Turkey of British proceedings m regard to Bahrein and the commission of “acts of sovereignty on the part of the English, the Ambassador was informed in reply that enquiries would be made into the point raised by him and that his Government might rest assured that it was not the intention of Her Majesty’s Government to interfere m the affairs of the Persian Gulf beyond what was mposed upon them by treaty foiythe preservation of peace in the waters The Ambassador was final y informed in April 1873, after investigation, that there were no grounds whatever for the statement that the British Government had attempted to exercise acts of sovereignty over Bahrein • -n 105 ’ • C ? ns / f &lt;lr [ ent 01 ? a Turkish claim to conscript Bahreinis resident n l ^ o 7 n r ) aS1 Amb assador m London was referred to the British Notes of 1851 and 1870 (paragraphs 61 and 99 above), which stated that Her Maiestv’s Government did not admit the claims of Turkey to consider Bahrein as part of the Ottoman dominions. In the same year, on a piratical attack beino- made on the island by certain Bahreini exiles who had signed a petition claiming m ash protection the Ambassador at Constantinople handed a memorandum to the Porte m which it was stated that Her Majesty’s Government could not recognise any rights or pretensions of the Porte over Bahrein. In 1875 a rumour that Her Majesty s Government were fortifying Bahrein led to representations Irom Turkey The rumour was unfounded and the Turks were so informed On its beconung known about the same time that the Turks themselves contemplated building a lighthouse on the island, the British Government entered a protest at Constantinople (October 1875), with the result that the project was abandoned 106. In 1876, consequent on steps taken by the Turkish authorities to enforce the claims of Qatar* merchants against Bahreinis, a Note was addressed to the Porte reminding them of the determination of Her Majesty’s Government to protect Bahrein against any attack on its independence. , I* 1 i^T 80 the Turkish Government took up the cause of the rebels ot 1869. Her Majesty s Government, after again disclaiming the exercise of sovereignty over Bahrein, which they regarded, they said, as independent promised to make enquiries as to certain acts of which complaint was made bv petitioners to the Turkish Government. First Executive Agreement between Her Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh of Bahrein (1880) A 4n ^ 88b . Political Resident, finding that the Sheikh was disposed c QTTuo e u special arrangement with the British Government, entered on the 22nd Hecember into what is known as the First Exclusive Agreement with him. By this Agreement the Sheikh undertook on behalf of himself and his “ successors in the Government of Bahrein to the British Government to abstain from entering into negotiations or making treaties of any sort with any State or Government other than the British without the consent^ of the said British Government, and to refuse permission to any other Government than the British to establish diplomatic or consular agencies or coaling depots in our territory, unless with the consent of the British Government. This engagement does not apply to or affect the customary friendly correspondence with the local authorities of neigh bouring Stales on business of minor importance.” The agreement was approved by Her Majesty’s Government and ratified in 1881. Summary, 1870-80 109. The claims of the Wahabi Amir disappear with the subjugation of Hasa by the Turks in 1871. The Turkish claim was repeatedly pressed during this period and was consistently rejected by Her Majesty’s Government. The Persian claim appears to have been dormant. Her Majesty’s Government repudiate suggestions that they have committed acts of sovereignty ’ ’ and conti nue to express their view that the Sheikh is an independent ruler. In 1880 the Sheikh entered into his first exclusive agree ment with Her Majesty’s Government. 85—177 F.O. to Turkish Ambassador, 8.8.1872. Hertslet, 30. I.O. to F.O., 30.7.1872. Lor. I, 914. Lor.

In September 1886 the Shah sent a verbal message to Her Majesty 8 Government through the Minister at Tehran that he considered the communica tion made to him in April 1869 as tantamount to an admission of his rights i Bahrein and that he was anxious to establish his authority effectually oyer the islands either by sending a Governor to Bahrein or possibly by recognising the Sheikh as representative of Persian authority, but that he wished the maritime police to remain in the hands of the British authorities. An answer was prepared by Her Majesty’s Government to the effect that they did not concur in His Majesty’s interpretation of the communication of April 1869. They had treaty engagements with the Sheikh, whom they' considered to be independent, and must hold the Sheikh to his engagements while fulfilling those they had contracted towards him. As, however, the Shah did not return to the subject, the message was not delivered. 111. In the same year presents sent from the Persian Governor of Lar to the Sheikh were returned to the sender. 112. In 1887-88 Persian intrigues took place with a view to the establish ment of Persian influence on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf. These were of little importance in the case of Bahrein, but it may be recorded that it appears that in the case of that principality the Persian Government had sanctioned a scheme for the seizure of Bahrein by Sheikh Jasim of Dohah in Qatar, who had seemingly undertaken to put the Persians in possession of the Sheikhdom. Two British ships were in February 1888 stationed off Bahrein, with instructions to prevent by force any hostile attempt to land by the Turks, Arabs or Persians, and the Minister at Tehran was asked by the Government of India so to inform the Persian Government. As, however, the Amin-us-Sultan, “on being questioned disavowed all designs on Bahrein, Her Majesty’s Minister thought it better to avoid the reference to forcible action.” Warning to Turkey, 1888 113. In March 1888 the Turkish Government were informed that any attempt to effect a landing in Bahrein would be opposed by force, and that no claim by the Porte to jurisdiction over Bahrein could be admitted, since Her Majesty s Government regarded the Sheikh as an independent ruler with whom they were in treaty relations. Second exclusive Agreement between Her Majesty’s Government and Bahrein (1892) T , ? n March, 1892, the Political Resident signed a second Fxciusi ve Agreement with the Sheikh of Bahrein on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government. The provisions of the Agreement (which was ratified on 12th May, .. 2, and wmch was expressed to be binding on the Sheikh, his heirs, and successors) were as follows ( 1 ) ( 2 ) (3) j yt ± will on no account enter into any agreement or correspondence ■ &lt; -tY 1 ^ 1 a - n T P° wer other than the British Government, i.Hit without the assent of the British Government I wall not consent o the residence within my territory of the agent of any other Government.

From the Second Exclusive Agreement to the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 British repudiations of Turkish Claims, 1892-98 m. In 1895 steps were taken at Constantinople by Her Majesty’s Govern ment to check an attempted invasion of Bahrein from Qatar, which seemed not improbably to have been inspired by the Turks, and later in the same year Her Majesty s Government twice reiterated to the Porte that Bahrein was under British protection and that no interference with it would be tolerated. The v lT^Y s l1 oP ^ el s Government on the status of the island were again omcially repeated^ at Constantinople on two occasions in 1896. In 1897 the Con stantinople Boar a of Health proposed to establish a sanitary post in Bahrein. The proposal was abandoned on the objections of the British delegate who represented that Bahrein was an independent principality under British protection. 118. In 1898 a Turkish request that a British Vice-Consul alleged to have been appointed at Bahrein should apply to the Turkish Government for his exequatur was refused on the ground that Her Majesty’s Government could not admit the right of the Turkish Government to insist that a British Consular Officer in Bahrein should be provided with a Turkish exequatur. In 1899 the Minister at Tehran informed the French representative at that capital that since 1880 the Sheikh was precluded by treaty from holding direct relations with any Power other than Her Majesty’s Government and that his subjects abroad were now under British protection. 119. A native British Agent had for a long period of years been maintained m Bahrein. In 1900 a British Political Agent was appointed at Bahrein. The post has been maintained since that date, and has been filled by an officer of the Indian Political Department since 1904. Lor. I, 935. Lor. I, 935. 1 &lt; The Incident of 1901 120. On 31st August, 1901 Va Belgian customs official in the service of the Lor i 935-6 Persian Government visited Bahrein, where he called on the Sheikh and informed him that he had been deputed by the Shah to obtain his consent to place Persian custom officials in Bahrein. An official protest was at once made by His Majesty’s Minister to the Persian Government in the course of which Sir A. Hardinge remarked that no intimation had been given to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf “ of this Persian mission to an Arab State under British protec tion and bound by special treaties, of which the Persian Government cannot be ignorant, to the Government of India .... It is my duty to place on record Teh. Desp. in the clearest manner that His Majesty the Emperor of India cannot acquiesce in any foreign interference in the affairs of Bahrein .... and that any attempt to disturb the relations established by treaties of long standing between those Chiefs and the Government of India will be regarded as an unfriendly act.” The Attabeg-i-Azam, in a note received on 17th September, 1901, replied: “As I have told you verbally, M. Simais has had no instructions from the Persian Government on this matter, and if there have been any steps on his part it must have been by mistake and he will be reprimanded for it.” The Disorders of 1904-05 121. In 1904-05, consequent on a series of attacks on Persians and on Lor. 1, 938-42. German subjects in Bahrein, the Persians appealed to the Shah. The Persian Government replied that His Majesty’s Government would take action on their behalf. The text of their telegram was as follows: “To the Merchants and Traders of the High Government living in Bahrein.

The Sheikh was ultimately'compelled bv His Majesty’s Government to give redress. Turkish Protest, 1904-05 123. On the Turks pressing in 1904-05 for an explanation of the action taken by His Maiestv’s Government in connection with the iL-treatment oi the German subject, the Turkish Ambassador was informed by Lord Lansdowite that it was a matter of common knowledge and well known u, the Turkish Government, that His Majesty’s Government had direct relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein; that the island and its natives were under British protection; and that His Majesty’s Government were within their rights in taking measures to obtain redress for the outrage committed there. On the Ambassador reverting to the subject later in 1905, he was informed (20th May, 1905) that His Majesty s Government must decline to entertain any 1 further representations from tne Turkish Government on the subject. Reassertions of Persian Claim, 1905—13 124. In 1905 the Persians again reasserted their claim. On the 19th February 1906, in reply to a further reiteration which appears to have been based on the treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857, the Minister at Tehran informed the Persian Government that £ The Treaties of 1809, of 1814 and of 1857 on this subject have always been scrupulously observed by His Majesty’s Government, but have no bearing on the present question. His Majesty's Government have never admitted the ownership or sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein. Such a claim is in their view entirely inadmissible. His Majesty’s Government consider the island of Bahrein and its inhabitants to be under British protection, and must decline to entertain any further representations on the subject. I am further to mention that this reply has invariably been made to the Ottoman Government, who have on several occasions advanced a claim to Bahrein.” The Note concluded by a reference to the Persian appeal for our assistance in 1904-05 and quoted in eectenso the telegram of reassurance (paragraph 121 above) to the Persian inhabitants of Bahrein then sent on behalf of the Persian Government. 125. On 13th September, 1906, the Persian Grand Vizier revived the Persian claim in a letter referring to Captain Bruce’s unauthorised agreement of 1822. He was reminded in reply that that agreement had been expressly disavowed by His Majesty’s Government and that Captain Bruce had been recalled. In a supplementary note the Grand Vizier’s attention was drawn to the fact that the then Shah himself had “ refused to recognise ” the stipulations of the Treaty of 1822, which had never been ratified, and had “ expressed his dis pleasure that the Prince of Shiraz should have entered into any engagements with the British Government without his knowledge or instructions.” 126. On the Ala-es-Sultaneh reviving the Persian claim, on the ground of the Agreement of 1822, in August 1907, his attention was drawm in a Note dated 13th August, 1907, to the notes referred to in the preceding paragraph; and to the fact that the Agreement had been disavowed alike by His Majesty’s Govern ment and by the Shah. The Note added that ‘ £ since 1822 the Turkish Government have raised claims on Bahrein, and, like the Persian Government, have been informed that Bahrein is under British protection.” 127. In 1908 the Persian Government, in a correspondence regarding the punishment of a Bahrein subject at Lingah, intimated that instructions had been sent to Lingah that reparation should be made, but added that His Majesty’s Minister would admit that £ the proprietary right of the Persian Government over the island is not a matter to be disputed.” The Note was returned as inadmissible to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A modified version was sub sequently accepted by His Majesty’s Government, which was acknowledged by a Note from His Majesty’s Minister, reaffirming that His Majesty's Government maintained as regards the status of Bahreinis in Persia the position that the island of Bahrein and its inhabitants were under Brtish protection, and that they would be guided entirely by their own views of the position should any action of the Persian Government make representations necessary.Persian Claim reasserted, 1922 23 jiB' P.G. 13, 67, § 26.

His Majesty's Government remove Sheikh Isa for Mis government (1923) 136 Consequent on the gross mismanagement of Sheikh Isa, who had been ruler of Bahrein since 1869, the Sheikh was deprived by His Majesty s Govern ment of his control of affairs in Bahrein on 26th May, 1923, and was granted an allowance, his son, Sheikh Hamad (whose right of succession had been recognised by His Majesty’s Government in 1901) being appointed to act for him ’ as his father’s fully empowered agent.” Oil concession granted by Sheikh, 1925 137. In 1925 an oil concession was granted by the Sheikh of Bahrein to tihe Eastern and General Syndicate, a British corporation, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government.

The Treaty of Jedda, concluded on 20tih May, 1927, between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Sand, the ruler of Saudi Arabia, in substitution for the Treaty of 1915 (paragraph 133 above), provided inter alia that £ His Majesty the King of the Hedjaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies should cc maintain friendly and peaceful relations witn the territories of • • • ■ Bahrein and. with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty’s Government.' Consequent thereon, a strong protest was received on 26th November, 1927, from the Persian Govern ment, copies of which were despatched to the League of Nations. The Persian protest was based essentially on the recognition stated to have been accorded to Persian sovereignty over Bahrein in Lord Clarendon’s Note of 29th April, 1869 (paragraph 85 above). A reasoned reply to the Persian Note was despatched by His Majesty’s Government on 18th January, 1928, and circulated to the League. While avoiding any definite statement as to their own position in Bahrein or its basis, His Majesty’s Government in their Note repudiated the Persian claim in the strongest terms, and intimated tihat no argument such as was suggested could be based on the communication of 29th April, 1869. Attitude of Sheikhs to Persian claim (1928) 139. The Sheikhs of Bahrein, on being apprised of the revival of Persia's claim, gave a letter to the Political Resident, requesting His Majesty’s Govern- P 1409 / 28 . ment i n accordance with their treaties “to defend Bahrein from outside interference ” and to act as their agents in rebutting the Persian claims, and intimating that the Sheikhs proposed to send Sheikh Mohamed, brother of Sheikh Hamad, the deputy ruler and son of the deposed ruler, Isa, as their representative in answering the claim should the case be taken to Geneva.31 Further Persian Protest, 2nd August, 1928. lengthy and reasoned^eltyto theBritfsh^oterf 18th Jannwy P “ 184/28 ' ecnsent of the State in question, whfch had not been^Tveu fn thetas^ Bahre ^ and alleged that the terms of the Foreign Office Note of 29th April 1869 were conclusive evidence of the view then held of the rights of Persia by His MaieX’s Government; that Bahrein had consistently recognised Persian s^reientv X could be proved by documentary evidence un to tL Uofo ^ Id ty ’ instigated to rebellion by a foreign Government; that no valid argument coulTbe founded on the direct relations into which the Sheikhs had entered with His Majesty s Government, since their action had been without the approval of their suzerain that the relations of Bahrein with Persia were more highly developed than with any other independent civilised country; that the Persian claim had been consistentiy and uninterruptedly pressed ; and finally that even if the Treaty of he yiIw\eid aV b 0 y W a Brltrihdffi^ 6 ^’ 8 X™'' ^ was matel ' iaI evide^^ , 1 ' y a .

The protest reserved the right of Persia to claim damages. Treaty negotiations were at the time proceeding with Persia, and it was thought unnecessary to send any reply to this Note, which was, however, circulated, at the request of the Persian Government, to the League of Nations. P. 5723/30. Discussions between His Majesty's Government and Persia, 1928-34 143. Between 1928 and 1934 treaty negotiations, with a view to the con- ciusion of a general treaty which should dispose of outstanding points of dmei ence, were in progress with Persia, the question of Bahrein figuring promi nently in those negotiations. The general attitude taken by the Persians was that Bahrein was a point of great importance to them, but that in return for a sufficient quid quo pro they would be prepared to abandon their claims. His Majesty’s Government on their side consistently maintained that the Persian claim was worthless, and that while they would gladly see it finally disposed /of as part of a general settlement, they would not be prepared to make any specific concession in return for its abandbnment. On 17th March, 1934, His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran communicated copies of certain treaties and agree ments between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India on the one hand, and certain Arab Rulers on the other, to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. In his acknowledgment Mirza Bagher Khan Kazemi remarked E 3357/2240/ that the Persian Government did not consider cc those of the agreements, treaties 9 h 19 34. and concessions in question which related to lands and places such as Bahrein, &amp;g., which are inseparable parts of Persian territory, to be either official or valid.'’ In his reply, His Majesty’s Minister said that he was instructed, as His Excellency had thought fit to mention Bahrein, “ to emphasise once more 9 i,°i 934 2240/ that, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, the Persian claim to these islands is entirely inadmissible.”P.Z.4902/33.

In the course of this review he remarked uponP the 'unsatisfactory situation resulting from the assertions of His Ma|estw s Government that the Persian claim to Bahrein was worthless, ^hile tne existence of the claim continued, nevertheless, to hamper freedom of action at every turn He further expressed the opinion that there was little hope of reaching a general settlement until the Shah was ‘- forced to believe that we me ^rrrdLd treatv or no treaty, to settle the Bahrein issue once and for all. XIV c —Summary 146. It may be convenient at this stage to summarise very briefly the claims to sovereignty over tihe islands which have been advanced by various countries since 1783; the particular basis of those claims in the case of Persia (whose claim is alone at the present time of any importance); and the basis and development of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government. A.—Claims to or Assertions of Sovereignty over Bahrein, 1873 1934 147.— (a) Muscat .—Bahrein subject to Muscat 1800-01, 1811 ? to 1816, 1820-22. Tribute paid to Muscat 1820. Bahreini independence recognised by Treaty 1829. Muscat thereafter deterred by His Majesty’s Government from pursuing its claims. (b) Egypt—Me^resentsitive of Mehemet Ali, Viceroy of Egypt, informed by Her Majesty’s Government in 1839 that no claim upon Bahrein could be admitted But in 1839-40 the Sheikh acknowledged Egyptian supremacy and he paid tribute during this period. (c) Wahabi Amirs of the Arab Mainland.--’Wih rein under protection of or subject to Wahabi Amirs 1803-11; 1816; 1830-33 (tributary); 1836-1838-39 (tributary); 1847 (tributary); 1852 Tribute). In 1867 (see paragraph 75) it was held by Government of India that tribute was paid to the Wahabis only in respect of mainland possessions and not of Bahrein. The claims of the Amirs disap peared with the conquest of Hasa by Turkey in 1871. (d) Turkey .—The islands have never An the period subsequent to 1783 been occupied by Turkey or (if the incidents of 1860-61 (paragraphs 67-9 above) are ignored) subject to Turkish sovereignty. But Turkish claims to them were advanced, directly or indirectly, in 1847, 1851, 1870, 1874, 1875, 1876, 1879, 1888, 1892. 1893, 1895, 1896 and 1905, and on each occasion, save in 1847, when certain assurances were given by Turkey (pamgraph 52), were rejected by the British Government. The Turkish claim w r as finally withdrawn in the Anglo-Turkisn Convention of 1913. That Convention was never ratified, but the withdrawal of the claim was confirmed by Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923. (e) Persia .—The Persian claim has been consistently urged on a variety of occasions through the period in question. The Sheikhs momentarily submitted themselves to Persia in 1799 and paid tribute. In 1816-17 they received a33 Persian envoy and apparently appealed for help to Tehran Thev ao-ain momentarily submitted to Persia and received an envoy in 1839. Persian a d “ n &amp; P ^ S ov received at Ba hrein in 1860-61, whde n 18 69 the deposed ex-Sheikh Mdhammed bin Khalifa may have made overtures to Persia (though there is no confirmation of this) to enable him to re-estabHsh his control over the island. The Persian claim appears, apart from this, to have been asserted in 1899 1825, 1844, 1848, 1861, 1862, 1866, 1868, 1869 1886? 1901 1905 1906 907 910, 1927 1928, 1930, 1932.33 and 1934, and to have be^n rejected V His Majesty s Government m 1822 as part of tiheir refusal to accept Captain Bruce’s Treaty), 1825, 1844, 1848, 1861, 1862, 1866.67, 1869, 1901 1906 1907 1908-^09 1923, 1928, 1929, 1933 and 1934. ’ ’ y ’ B.—Basis of the Persian Claim 148. Ignoring contentions such as that the use of the term “ Persian Gulf ” is a recognition of Persian sovereignty over the various islands of the Gulf Persia has at one time or other based her claim on the nine grounds examined below :— (1) History of the Islands frior to 1783 The history of the islands prior to the expulsion of the Persians in 1783 is dealt with in paragraphs 3 to 5 above. It will be seen that at various periods since the beginning of the Christian era, Persia has exercised a degree of control over the islands, and in particular that during the 30 years prior to 1783 her control was of a more definite character. On the other hand, the facts recorded above do not support any claim by Persia to an uninterrupted occupation or control of the islands. Persia has on various occasions in the past appealed to the early history of Bahrein in support of her claim that it is historically Persian territory. Since 1930, too, certain Persian newspapers, presumably inspired, have dealt at con siderable length with the history of Bahrein in the more or less remote past, and have supported their statements by quotations from, or references to, Arab or Persian geographers or historians^. Owing to the absence of records and the shortness of time available, it has been impossible to check these statements in detail, or to conduct elaborate researches into the writing of Arab geographers and others from which further information might be secured. But it is arguable that the position of the islands prior to 1783 is at most only of very indirect importance in the present connection. The essential weakness in the Persian claim is, it is suggested, that there has been no effective exercise of authority in the islands by Persia since her expulsion in 1783, and that the Sheikhs, who originally established themselves by conquest, have now acquired a prescriptive title, based on an uninterrupted occupation of 150 years by the present ruling family. (2) The Absence of Persian Consent to the Detachment of Bahrein from Persia The Persian Government, in paragraph 2 of their Note of 2nd August, 1928 (Appendix I, Paper B), invited attention to “ the following international juri dical principle. ... A territory belonging to a sovereign State cannot be lawfully detached so long as the right of ownership has not been transferred by this State to another State in virtue of an official act, in this case a treaty, or so long as its annexation by another State or its independence have not been officially recognised by the lawful owner of the territory.They added (correctly) that Persia has never renounced her sovereignty or ceded it to another State or ever recognised any of the Sheikhs of Bahrein as independent rulers. The argument put forward by the Persian Government under this head is examined in detail in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Note despatched by the Foreign Office on 18th February, 1929, in reply to the Persian Note of 2nd August, 1928 (Appendix I, Paper B). His Majesty’s Government expressed their inability to agree that any such principle, if alleged to be of universal application, formed part of international law. The deciding factor in the question of international title in cases in which territory has effectively established its independence of the former sovereign is the effective establishment by that territory of its inde pendence, £t and in the case of Bahrein His Majesty’s Government regard as wholly untenable the proposition that effective possession and administration by the present ruling family for 145 years, during which these rulers have been 85—177 f34 independent of Persia and dunng which no Government 1 cite^fafstoricaf precedente^to show that the theory of the necessity for the formal consent of the dispossessed State is not one which has ever obtained international acceptance. (3) The Unratified Treaty of 1822 The circumstances in which the Treaty of 1822 was concluded by Captain Bruce with the representative of the Prince Governor of Shiraz are set out m paragraphs 20-21 above. As will be seen, Captain Bruce concluded it without the futhority of or reference to Government. The treaty into which he had entered was 'immediately officially disavowed, and the Persian Government so informed, and Captain' Bruce, as a sign of disapproval of his action, was removed from his appointment. The Persian Government on their side equally disapproved the action of the Prince Governor of Pars m entering into any treaty discussions without the prior approval of t] 1 © Shah i The Persian Goverment were reminded of this in 1825, 1845, 1866, 1907, 1928 and 1929.] It appears impossible in these circumstances to base any legitimate claim to Persian sovereignty over Bahrein on the provisions of the i reaty of 1822. (4) The Gold Coin alleged to have been struck at Bahrein in 1817 Please see paragraph 47 above. A Persian Mission appears to have visited Bahrein in 1816 or 1817 (paragraph 9 above) and it is conceivable that a coin might have been struck on that occasion. On the other hand, it would probably be extremely difficult to prove that the coin had not in fact been struck elsewhere, though with an indi cation that it had been minted at Bahrein. The incident is in itself of relatively small importance, and it would, it is suggested, be impossible for Persia to use such an incident, even if it could be proved, save in support of arguments of much more substantial character. (5) Payment of Peeshkesh, Offerings or Tribute at various Stages by Bahrein to Persia From paragraph 6 above it will be seen that tribute appears to have been paid by Bahrein to Persia in 1799. The rulers of Bahrein may also have offered to pay tribute in 1839 (paragraph 32) and appear to have offered to do so in 1860 (paragraph 67). In assessing the importance of the payment of tribute in 1799, or, if it then took place, in 1839 or 1860, it is relevant that such payment or promise of payment was immediately followed by the submission of the rulers of Bahrein, in 1800 to Muscat, in 1839 to the Egyptians, and in 1860 to the Turks. In estimating the importance of such payments as evidence of a recognition of Persian suzerainty, the arguments advanced by Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran in his Despatch No. 28 of March 1845, in which Colonel Sheil remarks that the Chiefs of Bahrein “ had in all probability from time to time given peeshkesh, offerings, or tribute to Persia as a mark of superiority, as Kandahar and Herat still continue to do, without an acknowledgment of subjection ”; and the comment thereon of the Secret Committee of the 'East India Company that “ presents and complimentary messages do not imply an acknowledgment of sovereignty, and they have not been confined to Persia ” are also relevant. (6) Flying of the Persian Flag by the Sheikh of Bahrein (a) The Persian flag was hoisted by the Sheikh of Bahrein in 1860. But as will be seen from paragraph 67 above, hardly had it been hoisted when, on the arrival of a Turkish emissary, it was lowered and the Turkish flag hoisted in its place. At a later stage in 1860-61 the Persian and Turkish flags were apparently flown side by side by the Sheikh. It appears difficult in these circumstances to base any substantial argument on the incident. (b) The Notes addressed by the Persian envov in London to the Foreign Office in February 1869 alleged that the Persian flag had been hoisted by Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah and that the Resident had in September 1868 bombarded the Sheikh s palace on which the flag was flying. There appears to be no foundation for the suggestion that the Persian flag was flying when the Resident reached Bahrein or that it was fired on (see paragraph 80). ~ If previously hoisted it had. by the time of the Resident’s arrival, been hauled down.(c) In the undated letters from Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah communicated to the Foreign Office by the Persian envoy in April 1869, the Sheikh stated that he was hoisting the flag of the Lion and Sun over Bahrein. If, as seems probable from internal evidence, these letters date from the period of the abortive Persian Mission to Bahrein of 1860—61, it is relevant in assessing their importance that immediately after the reception of the Persian envoy, a Turkish envoy was received, the Persian flag hauled down and the Turkish flag substituted and 'hat in the early part of 1861 the flags of Persian and Turkey appear to’ have ^een flying side by side on the forts at Bahrein. There is nothing to show that either flag flew in Bahrein between the conclusion of the Convention of 1861 (paragraph 70) and 1868. (d) In September 1869 the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah attacked the islands, and with the assistance of Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah killed the ruling Sheikh Ain The Persian flag may have been hoisted on this occasion. But there is no reference to this in the detailed reports of the capture of the islands by Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah and Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah, or of the operations as the result of which those Sheikhs were reduced at the end of 1869. (Enclosure to Government of India’s Despatch No. 7 of 25th January, 1870; Resident’s Despatches of 11th September, 25th September, and 5th October, 1869.) (7) Letters from fast Rulers of Bahrein admitting Persian Suzerainty It is by no means improbable that in 1799, 1816-17, and 1839, the rulers of Bahrein addressed letters to the Persian Government acknowledging Persian suzerainty over the island, and they appear certainly to have done so in 1860. But the only letters the text of which has ever been communicated to Her Majesty’s Government are the two letters communicated by the Persian envoy in London in 1869. Those letters indeed categorically acknowledge Persian suzerainty over Bahrein and state that it has been uninterruptedly exercised in the past. But they appear to date from 1860, and the submission of Bahrein to Turkey and the hauling down of the Persian flag in the same year are, it is suggested, material in assessing the weight to be attached to them. (8) Declarations made hy Her Majesty's Government to the Persian Minister in London, April 1869 (a) These declarations are examined in paragraph 98 above. The text of the Note addressed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Persian envoy on 29th April, 1869, on which the subsequent Persian claims have to a considerable extent been based, is given in paragraph 85 above. The wording of that Note, and the general attitude adopted by Her Majesty’s Government, as evidenced by their acquiescence in the despatch of a mission to Bahrein by Persia, undoubtedly afforded Persia justification for the inferences she appears to have drawn. But, as pointed out in paragraph 10 of the Note addressed to the Persian Minister on 18th February, 1929, and reproduced in Appendix I, Paper B, the Note in question, while very loosely expressed, was never intended to bear the interpretation now placed upon it by the Persian Government (cp. in this connection paragraphs 102 and 110 above), and in stating that due considera tion had been given in the past by Her Majesty’s Government to the Persian claim it did not in any way admit that that claim was valid. The Note, indeed, confirmed the intention of the British Government to continue to hold the Sheikhs to the treaty engagements which had been entered into with them as independent rulers. (5) The undertaking given by Her Majesty’s Government in the same corres pondence to communicate in future with Persia before undertaking punitive action against the rulers of Bahrein is prima facie consistent with a recognition by Her Majesty’s Government of Persian claims to that island. But it appears, however, in fact to have been no more than a courteous indication by His Majesty’s Government of their desire to pay the fullest possible attention to any Persian claims. It will be observed that 'the first (and apparently the only) communication made to the Persian Government in discharge of this under standing, intimated to that Government the intention of Her Majesty s Govern ment to proceed at once against the “ Chief now in possession of Bahrein ’ consequent on his breach of the maritime peace and his attack on the Sheikh who had been placed in power at Bahrein by the British Government. 85—177 F 236 Aitcbu, XIII, No, v, 53.

(9) Closeness of Relations at the present Day between Persia and Bahrein The Sheikhs of Bahrein are strongly opposed to any recognition of Persian suzerainty Up. paragraph 139). The Persian suggestion that relations are at the present time closer between Persia and Bahrein than between Bahrein and any other independent civilised State is without foundation. Relations are at least equally close with Saudi Arabia, and the closest relations are maintained in addition with Great Britain and with British India. The Terms of the Treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 between the British / ^ /W) if n /Y) /7 1^ D If* Q I f! 149. In addition to the nine arguments examined above, Persia has on more than one occasion appealed to the provisions oi her treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 with the British Government in connection with her claim to Bahrein. Her appeal is based substantially on the fact that those treaties provide in certain circumstances for the evacuation of Persian territory occupied by British troops. The relevant passages of the treaties are as follows : (i) By the pveliTtiiiiCLTy Treaty of 1809 between His Majesty s Government and Persia, the Persian Government undertook not to permit any European force whatever to pass through Persia either towards India or towards the ports of that country”; while His Majesty’s Government undertook in case any European forces have invaded or shall invade the territories of His Majesty the King of Persia to ' afford to His Majesty the King of Persia a force, or in lieu of it a subsidy, with warlike ammunition . . . and officers. ...” Article 5 of the same treaty provided : “ If a detachment of British troops has arrived from India in the Gulf of Persia and, by the consent of His Persian Majesty, landed on the island of Karak or any of the Persian ports, they shall not in any manner possess themselves of such places, and from the date of these preliminary articles the said detachment shall be at the disposal of His Majesty the King of Persia, the amount of which shall be settled in the definitive treaty. ’ Article 6 provided that “ If the said troops remain by the desire of His Majesty the King of Persia either at Karak or at any other port in the Gulf of Persia” they shall be treated in a friendly manner by the Governor and arrangements made for the supply to them of provisions, &amp;c., at fair prices. (ii) Treaty of 1814.—Article (2) provides that “His Britannic Majesty further engages not to interfere in any dispute which may hereafter arise between the Princes, noblemen and great chiefs of Persia, and if one of the contending parties should even offer a Province of Persia with a view to obtaining assistance, the English Government shall not agree to such proposal, nor by adopting it possess themselves of such part of Persia.” Article 11 provided that “ Should His Persian Majesty require assistance from the English Government in the Persian Gulf, they shall, if convenient and practicable, assist him with ships of war and troops. The expenses of such expedition shall be accounted for and defrayed by the Persian Government, and the above ships shall anchor in such ports as shall be pointed out by the Persian Government and not at other harbours without permission, except from absolute necessity.” (iii) The Treaty of Peace of kth March, 1857, drawn up on the conclusion of the war between Persia and Great Britain, provided that “ Peace being happily concluded between Their said Majesties, it is hereby agreed that the forces of H.M. the Queen shall evacuate Persian territory, subject to the con ditions and stipulations hereafter specified” (Art. 2), and that “immediately on the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty the British troops will desist from all acts of hostility against Persia, and the British Government engages further that as soon as the stipulations in regard to evacuation by the Persian troops of the Herat and Afghan territories as well as in regard to the reception of the British Mission at Tehran shall have been carried into full effect, the British troops shall without delay be withdrawn from all parts, places and islands belonging to Persia . . . .” If Bahrein were Persian territory and if it had been occupied by British forces at the times envisaged by the treaty provisions to which appeal is made by Persia, there might be some force in the Persian argument! though even then His Majesty’s Government might claim that the fact that their actual relations with Bahrein had in no way been affected by the provisions of those treaties, and that Persia had made no protest at the time against any failure to implement those provisions clearly showed that Persia had accepted in the past the fact that Bahrein fell outside her territorial limits. In fact, neither37 f* in 1809, 1814 nor in 1857 was there any British occupation of Bahrein; while His Majesty s Government, never having admitted Persian sovereignty over Bahrein or regarded Bahrein as an integral part of Persia, have in the past adopted the attitude that the terms of the treaties referred to above are irrelevant for the present purpose. As stated by His Majesty’s Government in 1906 in reply to a Persian Note which based the Persian claim upon the provisions of those treaties, “ the treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 on this subject have always been scrupulously observed by His Majesty’s Government, but have no bearing on the present question. His Majesty’s Government have never admitted the ownership or sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein. Such a claim is in their view entirely inadmissible.” Review of the Persian Claim 150. It is revelant in the first place that from 1847 to 1913 the Turkish claim to Bahrein was pressed with at least equal vigour to the Persian claim, and that through much of that period the Turkish claim had a stronger practical justification than can be claimed by Persia since a period long prior to 1783, in that Turkey was the suzerain of the adjoining continental littoral of Arabia and held or preferred claims to both sides of the Gulf by which Bahrein is enfolded. Moreover, Muscat, which in the early part of the 19th century on more than one occasion established a temporary control over Bahrein and drew tribute from it, was deterred from urging its claims by force from 1829 onwards only by the attitude of His Majesty’s Government, while the Wahabi Amirs brought effective pressure to bear on Bahrein and drew tribute from it, though latterly probably in respect only of Bahreini possessions on the mainland, at frequent intervals through the early part of the 19th century, and desisted only with their subjugation by Turkey in 1870. Persia, in other words, was up to 1913 one only of the claimants to Bahrein, and through much of the period 1847 to 1913 if anything a less insistent and to some extent a less plausible claimant than Turkey. 151. _ These considerations, however, apart, the general effect of a review of the history of Bahrein over the last 150 years and of an examination of the specific arguments put forward by Persia and referred to in paragraphs 148-9 above is to suggest that there is no solid basis for a Persian claim to suzerainty or sovereignty over the islands. The geographical remoteness of the islands from Persia and the fact that their population is Arab are admittedly not decisive arguments. The real weakness in the Persian claim appears to be that there has been no effective exercise of Persian authority in the islands since the expulsion of Persia by the ancestors of the present ruling house in 1783. Such incidents as the momentary hoisting of the Persian flag in 1860, its flying side by side with the Turkish flag in 1860-61, or the temporary tender of allegiance to Persia in 1799, 1816-17 and 1839 must be considered in relation to the history of the islands as a whole, in the period now under consideration, and in particular to the consistent claim of Turkey between 1847 and 1913 and to the absence of any sequel to such momentary acknowledgment of or appeals to Persian power ; and they cannot carry the weight of a long dealing extending over a course of years. The remarks of the Government of India in 1870, quoted in paragraph 97 above, are relevant in this connection, as are the observations in paragraph 8 of the British Note to Persia of 18th February, 1929. It may be added, too, that during the period from 1783 Bahrein has at various dates been in a position to enter into treaty engagements or discussions with neighbouring States such as Muscat (paragraph 26), Turkey (paragraph 103), the Egyptian Viceroy, Mehemet Ali (paragraph 34) and His Majesty’s Govern ment on a basis inconsistent with her being at the time subject to Persian juris diction. A further point of some importance is the absence, so far as available records show, of any reference to Persia by the Sheikhs of Bahrein, at any date since the conquest of Bahrein by the ancestors of the present rulers in 1783, on the occasion of their accession, or of any formal acknowledgment by Bahrein on such occasions of sovereignty or suzerainty such as might be expected from a Sheikh who regarded himself as a vassal of Persia. Nor does any protest at the absence of any such formal acknowledgment appear at any time to have been made by Persia. 152. The correspondence of 1869-70, to which particular attention has been paid by Persia in the past, and which may be thought the strongest contention that Persia is in a position to put forward, may indeed be quoted as evidence of the view taken by Her Majesty’s Government at that period of the relation38 E.3538/1227/ 91. of Persia to Bahrein But it cannot be valid as against the Sheikhs, and while ft ScLly loosely exp^to ajrd so.e plaoed^m^it'by Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople^andsupported^by f e sl mTr“pretet1on ^ pCd^it with a minimum' of preliminary discussion in 1886 (paragraph 110); that at frequent intervals between 1870 and 1880 His Majesty’s Government maintained the independence of Bahrein against Turkey (paragraphs 99-107 above); that so early as January 1870 they drew the attention of the Turkish Government to the British Note of 1851 (paragraph 61 above) - and that His Majesty’s Government have uninterruptedly maintained the independence of Bahrein against Persia and Turkey alike since the date of the correspondence in question. . ,,, 153 The Sheikhs themselves appear, particularly m the early part of the past century before their relations with Her Majesty’s Government were placed on a more definite footing by the Agreements of 1880 and 1892, to have been °'uided bv a consideration of their own immediate interests m deciding on the inie Sf policy to be adopted towards the stronger rulers by whom they were surrounded. It is now more than three-quarters of a centiiiy since any appeal, however flimsy, appears to have been made to Persia by Bahrein. The present Sheikh, Salman, who succeeded his father in 1942, referred in a speech shortly after his accession to “this country of ours, Bahrein, .... fortunately an independent State”, and asserted that he would “ firmly adhere to the ancient and proven friendship with the British Government/ His father and grand father were both keenly apprehensive of any recognition of the Persian claim, and there is no reason to suppose that he is any less strongly opposed to it. C.—Attitude of British Government, 1820-1934 154. From 1820 onwards His Majesty’s Government consistently dealt with the Sheikhs as independent rulers. They concluded treaties with them on that basis in 1820, 1847, 1861, 1868 1880 and 1892, and they have been prepared to maintain their independence by diplomatic, or on occasion by forcible methods against challenge from outside, whether from Persia, Turkey, Egypt or the Wahabis. They originally entered into relations with the Sheikhs and promised them a measure of protection (paragraph 16) in the interests of securing the peace of the Persian Gulf. In the early stages of those relations they appear to have been solely concerned to achieve this object (in 1820 they even offered their mediation, which was, however, not accepted by Persia, to secure the payment of tribute to Persia by the Sheikhs), and they restricted their interference with the internal affairs of the Sheikhdom to the minimum required to secure the interests of British subjects. They were consistently reluctant to establish a protectorate oyer Bahrein in view of the probable local embarrassments in regulating the succes sion, &amp;c., in which this might involve them, and in 1849 they formally declined a request by the Sheikh that he and the islands should be taken under British protection. In 1861 (paragraph 70) they gave the Sheikhs more categorical guarantees of protection in return for more binding undertakings. Their correspondence with the Persian Minister in London in 1869-70 shows the Home Government, however, still ready at that date to adopt the attitude that if any other Power would discharge the objects whidh had led Great Britain to under take certain responsibilities in relation to Bahrein, she would gladly see them do so. Closer relations with the Sheikh and closer control over his freedom of action were established for the first time by the Exclusive Agreement of 1880. Relations became closer still with the conclusion of the Exclusive Agreement of 1892. XY.—Reference to Law Officers of the Crown 155. -This was the position in 1934 when it appeared possible that the Persian Government would bring the question formally before the League of Nations at its September session, and some discussion took place between the Foreign Office and the India Office as to the attitude which His Majesty’s Government should adopt in the event of the matter being raised under Article 11 or Article 15 of the Covenant. As part of this examination, and in connection with the abortive treaty negotiations of 1934, the Law Officers of the Crown w r ere asked to advise whether in their opinion Persia possessed any rights in or over Bahrein, and, if so, what the nature of those rights was.

Persian Government's refusal to recognise visas and endorsements for Bahrein 160. In 1933 the Persian Government began to refuse to visa passports which were endorsed for Bahrein and Kuwait, and a form of retaliatory action was taken bv His Majesty’s Government in consequence, although this was soon dropped owing to the complications which it involved, and specific endorsf men s for Arab States in the Persian Gulf on British passports were abolished. In May 1934 His Majesty’s Ambassador at Tehran made representations on the matter to the Persian Government, but Mirza Baghir Kazemi alleged that the endorsement “Bahrein” on British passports was,something new which was naturally not recognised by the Persian Government. Persia visa regulations issued in March 1934 contained (Chapter VI—Prohibitions) an instruction to refuse a visa for entry to Persia on passports “ endorsed as valid for the journey to Bahrein or which bear a visa for Bahrein. No satisfaction was received as a result of the representations made to the Persian Government, and the difficulty was overcome by the issue for journeys to Bahrein of a temporary passport without the endorsement or visa for Bahrein. Owing to the possibility of a harmful effect upon prospective treaty negotia tions of continuing the argument on this subject, m 1934 it was allowed to lapse, and the practical success of the device of the temporary passport has precluded the necessity of raising the question since that date. Agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Saudi Arabian Government regarding Transit Dues at Bahrein 161. In a note dated 30th May, 1936, the Minister for Foreign Affairs protested against the agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Arabian Government regarding Bahrein Transit Hues, which had been concluded in November 1935 and published in this country in May 1936. The Note stated that the Persian Government regarded the action of His Majesty’s Government as a denial of Persia’s indisputable rights, and stated that he must make all possible reserves in respect of present and future rights and interests of the Persian Government. A copy of this Note was sent by the Persian Government to the Secretariat of the League of Nations and to the Government of Saudi Arabia. A Note was addressed to the Persian Government in reply on the 1st October, reminding them of the views previously expressed by His Majesty’s Government in the matter, and a copy of this Note was sent to the League of Nations for circulation to members. This called forth a rejoinder from the Persian Government, dated 6th May, 1937, which referred to the “ indisputable rights” of the Persian Government, and stated that the arguments of His Majesty’s Government were not regarded as convincing, and could not shake the41 legitimate rights of Persia; a copy of this communication was not apparently sent to the League of Natrons, and no action was taken by His Majesty^GoTeSment The Liabilities of His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf asked^a question^ in^th^IIoiise^nf Under - Se 1 c retary of State for India was Ifrepfy he ' ,t th e H 0f 5 UWa ; tj .

Bahrein Nationality and Property Laws 164 In February 1937 the Bahrein Government enacted a Nationality Law and a law regarding the ownership of immovable property in Bahrein by loreigners. The main object of these laws was to retaliate for the treatment of jDanremis m Persia. The Persian Government addressed a Note of protest to His Majesty s Minister in Tehran on 13th June, stating that these laws were contrary to the sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein, and that they could not in any e. 3757/781/ way impair the rights of the Persian Government. As on the occasion of the 9L ersian protest of 1936 regarding the levy of transit dues at Bahrein (see para- graph 161), a brief reply was sent on 9th September stating that the views of His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom on the subject had been set out on many occasions, and notably in the Note of 18th February, 1929. The intended notification applying the Bahrein Property Law to Persian subjects i^qcjv 6111 Wa ^ Polished on 1st November. In a Note dated 28th December, e. 7379/781/ 1938, the Persian Government duly protested against the notification, stating 91 &gt; 1937 - that it was now clear that the sole object of the Property Law was to impose restrictions on the ownership of property by non-Bahreini Persians who had settled in the island. A copy of this Note, which again referred to Persia’s legitimate rights and denied the independence of the islands and the existence of any special British rights therein, was sent to the League of Nations. In this e. 428/14/91, case it was decided not to pursue the matter with the Persian Government, and 1938 - His Majesty’s Government contented themselves with addressing a letter to the League of Nations on 12th March, 1938, stating that they had nothing to add to their Note to the Persian Government of 9th September, 1937. e. 1213/14/91 1938.

Postal Services between Persia and Bahrein 166 The last occasion which can be traced on which correspondence passed between His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government on the question of sovereignty over Bahrein was in connection with difficulties which had arisen regarding postal services between Persia and Bahrein. It is unnecessary eic to enter Into the details, of a somewhat involved correspondence between 1939 and 1943 it being sufficient to record that, m INotes of 29th June 194 , and 24th December, 1942, His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran and the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs respectively reserved the claims of their Governments regarding the ownership of the islands. Persian Government decree regarding import of Petroleum Products from Bahrein . 167. Prominence was given by the Persian press in April 1946 to a decree of the Council of Ministers laying down that all petroleum products imported from Bahrein should be subject to the same dues and royalties as tnose le\iei on Anglo-Iranian Oil Company products. Satisfaction was expressed with this action “ since the Persian Government and nation considered! Bahrein an mtegxal part of Persian territory.” The quantity imported from Bahrein during the previous twelve months was extremely small, and this and other signs mane a renewal of the claim to the islands appear to be imminent. Up to the end ot 1946, however, the subject was not re-opened' by the Persian Government. Remarks of the Persian Prime Minister to the United States Ambassador 168. On 31st August, 1946, the United States Ambassador 3 1 Tehran paid a few hours’ visit to Bahrein, and while there told the Political Resident that the Persian Prime Minister, Qawam as Sultaneh, had shown him the original of the letter of 1869 (paragraph 84 above) from Her Majesty’s Government, upon which, he said, Persia mainly based her claim to the islands. He had added that at present he did not propose to pursue the claim with the United Nations or the International Court of Justice, as he thought it was unlikely to succeed owing to the strength of British influence in those bodies. Recent references to Bahrein in the Persian Press 169. The subject of Bahrein came up, after a long silence, early in 1945 when articles appeared in the Tudeh papers {Darya of 7th January, and Nida-yi-Haqiqat of 11th January) which maintained that the islands belong to Persia, and that His Majesty’s Government had, by implication, accepted Persian sovereignty over them in 1935. The evacuation of Bahrein was expected to take place at the same time as that of the rest of Persia. The second article charged His Majesty’s Government with violation of Persian rights oyer the islands, and claimed that the Sheikh’s agreement with the Standard Oil Com pany was illegal. The following month a poem was published in a Shiraz Tudeh paper on the same subject. 170. On 21st September, 1945, a leading article in Nauruz-i-Iran referring to a statement on the evacuation of Russian troops made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Majlis, called upon the United States of America to exacuate Bahrein and postpone the exploitation of the oilfields. Persia’s right of ownership in Bahrein was said to be proved by records in the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.43 V 171. In February, March and May 1946 further press references occurred Mashrutiyat (Centre), in a series of articles written in December states ■ “ There is no difference between Azerbaijan and Bahrein from Persia’s point of view . . . . We favour the integrity of the entire country .... Foreign penetration m any part of the island is intolerable to us ... . The Government should insist on the establishment of its power m Bahrein, just as it did in Azerbaijan ” 174. Although history shows that it is not necessary to see the Soviet hand behind these claims, it must be recorded that they appeared in newspapers known to be sponsored by the Soviet, and that they are constantly echoed m the Soviet broadbasts as evidence of the “ imperialism ” of His Majesty’s Government Research Department, Foreign Office. 13th January, 1947. APPENDIX I Notes Exchanged with the Persian Government, 1927-29, respecting the Persian Claim to Bahrein. [E 5063/184/91] (A) M. Khan Mossaed to Sir Austen Chamberlain.—{Received November 28.) Persian Legation, London, November 26, 1927. Your Excellency, I HAVE the honour to state that the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs has recently addressed a note to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, of which the following is a translation :— 1- According to information received by the Persian Government, a treaty was concluded between His Britannic Majesty and Ibn Saud and signed at Jeddah on the 20th May last, of which article 6 is as follows :— “‘His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its dependencies undertakes to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of Kuwait and Bahrain, and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast, who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty’s Government.’ “2. The sovereignty of Persia over the Island of Bahrain being well founded, the Imperial Persian Government, at the time a special treaty was concluded between the British Government and the Sheikh of Bahrain, right fully protested, and Lord Clarendon, in a letter dated the 29th April, 1869, addressed to the then Persian Minister in London, formally acknowledged the justice of that protest. “ 3. You will realise that the insertion of article 6 in the above- mentioned treaty, in so far as it relates to Bahrain, is averse to the territorial integrity of Persia, and, consequently, incompatible with the friendly relations subsisting between two neighbouring countries. “4. I therefore earnestly protest against the insertion of the above article in the treaty, and shall look forward to suitable measures being taken, as soon as practicable, by His Britannic Majesty’s Government, with a view to its elimination. “5.1 have to add further that, Persia being a member of the League of Nations, the Imperial Persian Government, conformably to article 10 of the Covenant, which guarantees the territorial integrity of its members, have forwarded a copy of their note to the League of Nations, with the request that their protest may receive due consideration.” 85—177 G 244 I beg leave to bring this matter to the notice of your Excellency for your kind consideration. . HOVHANNES KHAN MOSSAED, Persian Minister. [E 220/51/91] ( B ) Sir Austen Chamberlain to Hovhannes Khan Mossaed o- Foreign Office, January 18, 1928. ’ I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 26th November, containing the formal protest which the Persian Government nave seen fit to make against the terms of article 6 of the Treaty of on the 20th May, 1927, between His Britannic Majesty ana His Majesty the King of the Heiaz and Nejd and its dependencies, on the ground that the reference in that article to the Islands of Bahrein is contrary to tne territorial mtegri y of fr^0I*Slct 2. In reply, I shall be grateful if you will inform your Government that His Majesty’s Government are not aware of any valid grounds upon which the claim of the Persian Government to sovereignty over these islands is or can be based. Geographically, the islands are not a part ot I ersia, nor are tne inhabitants of Persian race. His Majesty s Government are aware that during part of the 17th century and for some years during the latter part or tne 18th century Bahrein was overrun and occupied by Persian troops, or bv the followers of certain chiefs from the eastern shores of the Persian Gulf; but it appears to be established that in or about the year 1/83 the Government of the Shah were dispossessed of the islands by an invasion of Arab trioes under the leadership of the direct lineal ancestor of the present Sheikh, and that since that date the islands have never at any time been under the effective control of Persia. 3. The Persian Government have on various occasions alleged that their claim to sovereignty over Bahrein has been recognised by His Majesty’s Govern ment. While it is not evident that, even if this assertion were justified, it would confer on Persia the right of ownership which on other grounds appears so difficult to establish, His Majesty’s Government feel that they must once and for all declare this statement to be entirely inadmissible. 4. The special treaty relations between His Majesty’s Government and^the successive Sheikhs of Bahrein, to which reference is made in the Treaty of Jeddah, have now been in existence for more than a century, the first in the series of under takings by which those relations are regulated having been signed in the year 1820. The agreements have throughout been concluded on the basis that the Sheikh of Bahrein is an independent ruler. His Majesty’s Government do not deny that the claim to independence of the Sheikh is one which has from time to time been contested by the Government of the Shah, and in particular in the discussions which took place in 1869, to which reference is made in your note. I desire, however, to point out that your Government are under a complete misunderstanding in inferring from the terms of the communication made by the late Earl of Clarendon to the Persian Minister on the 29th April, 1869, that any recognition of the validity of the Persian claims to sovereignty in Bahrein was at that time intended. In that note it was stated that Her Majesty’s Government had given due consideration to the protest of the Persian Government “against the Persian right of sovereignty over Bahrein being ignored by the British authorities,' but it in no way admitted any such right. On the contrary, the whole tenor of the note should have made it clear that Her Majesty’s Government maintained their right to enter into direct treaty relations with the Sheikhs of Bahrein as independent rulers; and while at the same time it indicated that Her Majesty’s Government would gladly transfer to Persia, if she were able and willing to perform them, certain duties in the Persian Gulf towards the performance of which the treaty relations in question contributed, and offered, in view of the friendly feelings entertained by Her Majesty’s Government towards Persia, to cause the Persian Government to be informed beforehand, w~hen practicable, of any measure of coercion which the conduct of the Sheikhs might have rendered necessary, it is evident that no recognition of the validity of the Persian protest, or of the Persian claim to suzerainty, was thereby intended or implied. 1 be note, in fact, as the Persian Legation at Constantinople was45 in Turkey, contai^nothing acknowkd' ^j 68 ^’ 8 Ambassador to suzerainty had previously been made ^° w ' ed S lne nt that the Persian claim ments entered into between^the British nunierou s supplementary agree- between 1869 and the present day have enuXr 6111 ^ th V ulers ^ Bahrein a clami to sovereignty in Bahrein on the part eith^of to ^ assuta P tion th at Shah or of the Turkish Government eon Id not' t th ?

Veuillez, &amp;c. F. PAKREVAN. [E 853/33/91] (D) Sir Austen Chamberlain to Hovhannes Khan Mossaed Sir, Foreign Office, February 18, 19211. IN a note dated the 18th January, 1928, I had the honour to inform you, in reply to your note of the 26th November, 1927, respecting the claim advanced by your Government to the islands of Bahrein, that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were not aware of any valid grounds upon which the claim of the Persian Government to sovereignty over those islands was or could be based. Some months later, on the 2nd August, 1928, the Persian Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran a further note explaining in detail the reasons which have led his Government to consider themselves justified in advancing such a claim. I now have the honour to request that you will convey to your Government the following reply :—- 2. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have examined with the greatest care the views set forth in the Persian Government s note of the 2 nd August, and have endeavoured to extract from the many unsupported declarations that Bahrein forms an integral part of Persia (a statement which, as I have already indicated in my note under reference, bears _ no relation to geographical facts), the essential arguments on which this claim is based. They note that the Persian Government do not in any way base tT^ir claim on the alleged recognition of their rights in the past by His Majesty s Government, bo far as can be deduced from their note under reply, their claim is, m fact, founde on three main arguments: Firstly, on uninterrupted possession except foi t e period of Portuguese occupation between 1507 and 1622; secondly, on an alleged principle of international law that a territory belonging to a sovereign tate cannot be lawfully detached so long as its annexation b;y anot er a e or * s independence have not been officially recognised by the lawfu owner o e territory; and, thirdly, on documents of a date later than the end of t e 18th century, in which the sheikhs of the islands are alleged to ave ec are their submission to the Persian Government, and on the al ege ^ of tribute to the Persian Government. After full examma ion o e ^ mvon His Majesty’s Government have reached the conclusion, for the below, that they entirely fail to substantiate a Persian claim to sovereignty o the islands at the present day. &lt;&lt;-n -u • Voo and 3. In the first place, the statement that Bahrem has alway uninterruptedly formed part of Persia m past centunes except during the Portuguese occupation from 1507 to 1622 is not one w , p , pass unquestioned. I have already drawn attention o i . eouallv geographically this assertion is misleading. Historica y but it cannot misleading. The earlier history of the islands before _ Inv^rei on tv all through seriously be maintained that they were subject to Persian . lynaffig Ages On the Arab, Mongol and Tartar invasions and the anarchy of the contrary, modern historians have expressed the PP 1 subiect to chiefs the beginning of the 16th century the inhabitants of Bahrein vere subject to ' 85—17750 nf thpir own race and amon^ contemporary writers, the Arabian geographer, Idrisi writing in the latter half of the 12 th century, stated categorically that the island wSn governed by an independent chief, ^-’tere^ possible to accent the view that the island was continuously subject to Persia before lout. Between the years 1507 and 1622 the islands were occupied by the Portuguese, as the Persian Government themselves admit. The period of 1 1 f rs ’, a “ ^ ® nf ofhhe 1622 and ended in 1783, when the Persian trTOps wwe findiy dr ven out of the islands bv the ancestors of the present bheikh of Bahrein, but it i- not be supposed that even during this period of Persian ascendancy, Persian rule was continuous and unchallenged, or that it brought peace and prosperity to the inhabitants. The Persian occupation after the expulsion of the Portuguese was of uncertain duration, but it seems to be established that about the year 1718 a descent was made upon the island by the Omani Arabs, who then occupied it for a short period. In the middle of the 18th century control appears to have passed into the hands of the once powerful Huwala Arabs, who even at the present dav are strongly represented there, though in 1753 Persia- was again able to assert her ascendancy by conquest. In 1783, however, the troops of His Majesty tne Shah were finally' driven out by the Utubi Arabs, and the authority of Persia ceased, never to be re-established. . . , . .i 4 . It will be evident from the brief historical summary contained m the preceding paragraph that such historical evidence as can be adduced m favour o the Persian claim must rest mainly upon intermittent occupation between the years 1622 and 1783, a period which comprises at least two periods of Arab rule. On the other hand, a period of approximately equal length between 1783 and the present day has elapsed during which no dominion has been exercised m the islands by Persia, and Arab rule has been uninterrupted. In these circumstances His Majesty’s Government cannot but regard the claim of Bahrein to independence from Persia as abundantly established. . , , i 5 It i s in the light of the historical events summarised above that the second argument of the Persian Government must be examined, viz., that part of their note now under reply in which they affirm as an alleged principle of international law the statement that “a territory belonging to a sovereign State cannot be lawfully detached so long as the right of ownership has not been transferred by this State to another State in virtue of an official act, in this case a treaty, or so long as its annexation by another State or its independence have not been officially recognised bv the lawful owner of the territory.” Even if this statement could be accepted as valid, it would still be necessary for Persia to prove that she is, or ever has been, the lawful owner of Bahrein, and that such rights as she may have acquired 5 in former ages by conquest and the exercise of force outweigh those not only of the Portuguese, but of the Arab inhabitants themselves. _ 6 His Majesty’s Government, however, deny without hesitation that any such principle if alleged to he of universal application, forms part of inter national law. ’ The assertion that the consent of the dispossessed State is invariably required to validate a change of sovereignty is contradicted both by international practice and the facts of history. Moreover, it would, if it existed, seriously prejudice the maintenance of peace and international order. It would be open to any State to advance a claim to territory, of which it has not for centuries been'm effective possession, on the ground that its loss of possession m distant ages had not been confirmed by a subsequent treaty. To assert such a legal principle would be to assert that on a disputed question of territory the one factor that is decisive is the expressed will of one of the disputants. On the contrary, in cases where a territory has effectively established its independence of the former sovereign, a treaty by which the disposed owner recognises its independence is in effect chiefly valuable as conclusive evidence that, in the view of the former sovereign, such independence has been effectively established. In such cases the effective establishment by the territory of its independence is the deciding factor in the question of international title, and in the case of Bahrein His Majesty’s Government regard as wholly untenable the proposition that effective possession and administration by the present ruling family for 145 years, during which these rulers have been independent of Persia, and during which no Persian authority has been exercised in their dominions, can be affected by the mere consideration that the Persian Government have not set their signature to a document formally recognising the fact of their independence. 7 It is, moreover, abundantly clear from historical precedents that the theory of the necessity for the formal consent of the dispossessed State is not one which has ever obtained international acceptance. The revolted Spanish colonies in South America were diplomatically recognised as independent States by the United States Government in 1822 and by the British Government51 t man 7 y ears ^ fore independence was formally admitted by Spain. The independence of Texas in 1837 and that of Panama in 1903 were recoemsed by the Tinted States, and subsequently by Great Britain and other European Powers, long before Mexico and Colombia had ceased to look upon those teiritones as ie\olted provinces. In these instances, to which others could, if necessary, be added, tne effective establishment of independence was clearly regarded by the Powers as the ruling factor in the situation, and the consent of the dispossessed State was not held to be a condition sine qua non of a valid transfer or acquisition of territory. In the case of Bahrein, whose sheikhs have now been in treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government for more than a century as independent rulers, it was thus not necessary for His Majesty’s Government to await the consent of Persia before such recognition could be accorded. 8 . The only other argument advanced by the Persian Government in support of their claim is the statement that the sheikhs of Bahrein at some time later than the end of the 18th century declared in writing their entire submission and fidelity to the Persian Government, and that they paid tribute to the Persian Government. Although the Persian Government do not give any details in corroboration of this assertion, and although it would probably be difficult at the present day to prove the authenticity of any documents which may be in their possession, His Majesty’s Government are perfectly prepared to admit the possibility that such documents may exist. They do not, however, consider that the existence of such documents, or even evidence, were this forthcoming, of payments by the Rulers of Bahrein to the Government of the Shah can be regarded as establishing the validity of Persia’s claim. They have always been well aware that the unfortunate rulers of the islands, surrounded by warlike and more powerful States which menaced their independence, professed on various occasions during the first sixty or seventy years of the 19th century an unwilling allegiance to Muscat, to Persia, to Turkey, to the rulers of the mainland of Arabia, even to Egypt—to any Power, in short, who would agree to offer them protection and seemed at the time in a strong enough position to do so; and that at different times for short periods they paid tribute to Muscat, Egypt, or the Wahabi Arabs of the mainland. Any argument based on payment of tribute would, therefore, be available in support of a claim to sovereignty over Bahrein by any of the States to which tribute was, in fact, paid, and, in any case, it is evident that this timid and vacillating policy pursued on occasion by his predecessors cannot be held to affect the position of the present sheikh, who is firm in his determination to resist the Persian Government’s claims, and has empowered His Majesty’s Government to refute them on his behalf, in virtue of the treaties which'give them the right of defending Bahrein from external aggression. 9. In view of the fact that the Persian Government do not base any part of their claim on the alleged recognition of that claim by His Majesty s Government in the past, it seems unnecessary here to reply in detail to the various arguments by which the Persian Government endeavour to show that their claims have received British .recognition in the past. I have already, in my note of the 18th January, 1928, explained that it has never on any occasion been the intention of His Majesty’s Government to admit the validity of Persia s claims, and I must now ask the Persian Government to believe that a further full and careful examination of the contemporary records, confirms that statement in its entirety. Ever since the year 1820, when His Majesty s Government first entered into special treaty relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein without any reference to the Government of the Shah, they have acted on the assump ion that the sheikh is an independent ruler. In 1822, when Captain William Bruce was recalled for having negotiated the terms of an agreemen wi e Prince Governor of Shiraz without their authority, the mam reason recorded for his recall and for the prompt disavowal of this tentative agreement is t at “ it acknowledges the King of Persia’s title to Bahrein of which there is not the least proof.” No clearer statement could possibly have been made of t e views held by Hfs Majesty’s Government at that date, more t an a cen ury ago, they have never since seen any reason to alter 0 P ini ^ L 1QAQ , 10. The Earl of Clarendon’s note of the 29th April, 1869 to which the Persian Government devote so large a part of their note now un er rep y, wae certainly never intended to bear the interpretation now p ace P 'iqo« Persian Government. As was pointed out m my note of the 18th January 1928 it admitted that the Persian Government had advanced a claim ^ Ba h r em J stated that due consideration had been given to their claim, but it did not admit 85—177 H 2 i52 that their claim was valid. It even affirms the intention of the British Government to continue to hold the sheikhs to the treaty engagements which, had been entered into with them as independent rulers. His Majesty s Government are entirely unable to admit that an implicit acknowledgment of the validity of the Persian claims is constituted by the reference m that note to the considerations which led to the establishment and the maintenance of those treaty relations; nor can they agree that the dependence or otherwise of Bahrein on Persia can in any way be affected by the fact that in entering upon and maintaining their treaties with the sheikhs they were principally moved by a desire to suppress piracy and the slave trade and to maintain the police of the Gulf duties which the Persian Government themsehes were not in a position effectively to perform. It is true that at that time Her Majesty’s Government were mainly influenced by the consideration that they, like I ersia, were interested in the safety of the Persian Gulf for commerce, and that they would gladly have accepted Persia’s co-operation in maintaining order had her naval position admitted of it; but, although they did not consider Persia’s claims to ownership to be valid, they were not at that time directly concerned in refuting them. The special treaties by which they eventually agreed to accept the control of the sheikh’s foreign relations were concluded at a later date. 11 . I must in this connexion invite the Persian Government to take note of the fact that there is no conceivable ground for the suggestion in the last paragraph of the second section of your Government’s note under reply that the independent status enjoyed by the rulers of Bahrein can in any sense be represented as the result of c ' rebellion at a foreign State s instigation. This suggestion is one which His Majesty’s Government repudiate as entirely unjustifiable. When in 1820, consequent on their suppression of the piratical activities of the independent rulers of the trucial coast of Oman, they found it; necessary to consider the position in regard to Bahrein, nearly forty years had elapsed since the conquest of this island by the ancestor of the present sheikh, and during those years Persia had exercised no dominion in the islands and appeared to have taken no measures to re-establish her position. They had accordingly no hesitation in entering into negotiations and concluding a treaty with the independent ruler without prior reference to the Government of the Shah. Their object, as stated by Lord Clarendon in 1869, was the suppression of piracy and the maintenance of peace in the Gulf; they strictly confined themselves to the measures necessary to attain that object, and while it might have been open to them to establish their dominion over the sheikh, they did not choose to do so, but contented themselves with an arrangement to secure the safety of international shipping without imposing on themselves the burden of administration. They maintained this position not only in 1820 but on other occasions in subsequent years, and notably in 1848, when they declined to accede to the sheikih’s request that his dominions should be incorporated in those of Her Majesty the Queen. The treaty of 1820, by which the Sheikh of Bahrein bound himself to abstain from plunder and piracy by land and sea, from the slave traffic and from inter-tribal war was followed in 1847, in 1856, and 1861 by further treaties designed to secure the same objects—the suppression of slavery, and the general pacification of the Gulf in the interests of international shipping. The British Government concluded all these treaties with the sheikh as an independent ruler, and consistently refused throughout to admit the Turkish, Persian and other claims to sovereignty over his dominions. It was not until the treaty of 1861 that Her Majesty’s Government, in return for the sheikh’s undertaking to abstain from maritime aggression, war and piracy, assured him in return of their support against similar aggression, nor till a still later period in 1880 and 1892, that they took upon themselves the unqualified liability for the foreign relations of that ruler, under which he has now invoked their assistance in repelling what he not unnaturally regards as a wholly unprovoked attempt on his independence by a foreign Government. 12 . In conclusion, His Majesty’s Government cannot refrain from expressing their surprise that the Persian Government should have referred in this correspondence to article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, under which the members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression, the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all members of the League; and that they should seemingly imagine that the terms of this article lay an obligation on members of the League to support Persian pretensions to an island which is separated from Persia by the whole width of the Persian Gulf, and over which Persia has exercised no authority for 145 years.58 deinande .» Gouv,™,^.^ S'r pi e nsrr™K.“.“ n —&gt;-»« * ~ &gt;» membres de 1'umon.’ v eu ill e z agreer, &amp;c.

It is conceived that the answers to the question as to which your advice is desired will depend almost entirely on the view taken of the historical facts^there seT out, and^t has therefore been thought necessary to state those facts in detail. The situation may, however, be summarised as toiloV'S . 5. The Sheikhdom was for some time prior to 1783 under Persian rule The Persians were in that year driven out of the islands by Arabs from the mainland of Arabia under the leadership of the direct ancestor oi the present ruling: house, in whom sovereignty has rested since that date. Claims t sovereignty, or possibly in some cases suzerainty, over Bahrein have repeatedly been preferred bv Persia since 1783. They were also preferred by Turkey (suzerain up to the war of the adjoining mainland) with great insistence on a number of occasions between 1847 and 1913, in which latter year tne Turkis Government finally recognised the independence of the island; and they have been put forward in the past by Muscat; by Egypt; and by the Wahabi Amirs of the Arab mainland.

Bahrein, at least since 1820, has consistently been regarded as independent by His Majesty’s Government, who have been in special treaty relations with its rulers on that basis since that date. Those treaty, relations (which have throughout involved contingent liabilities for protection) were strengthened in 1861, while by engagements contracted in 1880 and 1892 the ruling house have undertaken obligations which place their external relations m the hands of His Majesty’s Government and preclude them from ceding territory save to, or with the consent of, His Majesty’s Government.59 Majesty’s Government and th^Perskn t'ove 168 W f 6 excnan g ed between His claim to Bahrein, of wMch copies have heJn r® 1 m 1 ' eg J ard t0 the latter ’ s General of the League of Nations for the Secretar y- the League.

The fullest expression of the Persian attitude is that contained m the notes of the 26th November, 1927, and the 2nd August, 1928. The various arguments which from time to time Persia has advanced in support of her claim are as follows :— (1) The history of the islands prior to 1783. Persia contends that an appeal to history shows that prior to this date the islands were from a remote period subject, and tributary, to her. (2) The absence of Persian consent to the detachment of Bahrein, admittedly at one stage prior to 1783 a Persian possession, from Persia; and the fact that Persia has never recognised the islands as independent and has consistently urged a claim to them. (3) Certain provisions of the treaty (unratified and disavowed by both parties) concluded between Captain Bruce, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the Minister of the Prince Governor of Shiraz, in 1892. (4) A gold coin alleged to have been struck at Bahrein in 1817. (5) Payment by Bahrein at various stages of ££ peeshkesh ” offerings, or tribute to Persia. (6) Flying of the Persian flag by the Sheikh of Bahrein. (7) Letters from past rulers of Bahrein admitting Persian suzerainty. (8) A note addressed by His Majesty’s Government in April 1869 to the Persian Minister in London. (9) Closeness of relations at the present day between Persia and Bahrein. 9. The arguments referred to in the preceding paragraph are briefly examined in paragraphs 147-152 of the historical memorandum (Paper A) attached, which suggests the conclusion that they afford no solid basis for a Persian claim to sovereignty or suzerainty over the island of Bahrein. 10. Apart from the arguments based on historical events, the only important legal consideration which has been advanced by the Persian Government in support of their claim is that contained in paragraph 2 of the note addressed by the Acting Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran on the 2nd August, 1928 (p. 4, Paper B). You will observe that a detailed reply to this argument was made in paragraphs 5-8 of the note addressed by Sir Austen Chamberlain to the Persian Minister in London on the 18th February, 1929 (pp. 8 and 9, Paper B). Reference may also be made in this connexion to the article entitled ££ Sovereignty, Seisin and the League” by Sir John Fischer Williams (British Yearbook of International Law, 1926, p. 24). 85-177 kI 60 3 11.

See footnote to Index. f For Papers B-H see Appendix I. Report The Persian claim to sovereignty over Bahrein appears to be based upon the view that from time immemorial the islands were Persian territory, and that by virtue of the fact that Persia has never expressly recognised their independence, coupled with various assertions of sovereign right on the part of Persia, and of admissions from time to time of the Persian claims on the part of the rulers of Bahrein and of His Majesty’s Government, Persian sovereignty has never been lost. The facts as narrated in the historical memorandum prepared by the India Office do not, in our opinion, support this view. There is no satisfactory evidence of any kind that at any date before 1783 Bahrein was incorporated in Persian territory. The most that can be said is that there was a period of Persian occupation at the beginning of the 17th century, and that for a short period in the 18th century a d,e facto control was exercised by a Persian Governor. Whether this control ever acquired the character of de jure sovereignty may be doubted, but, in onr opinion, the expulsion of the Persian garrison in 1783 never to return makes it impossible to rely upon what had happened before that event. The later history of Persian claims to sovereignty over the islands affords no evidence of any recognition either by His Majesty’s Government or by any other sovereign power of Bahrein as Persian soil. The Bruce Treaty of 1822 cannot be relied on, while the three treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 appear to us to be wholly silent as to Persian rights over Bahrein. The British note of 1869 is the high-water mark of any admission of Persian rights. Even this note, however, falls far short of a recognition of sovereignty, and nothing said or done thereafter gives any support to Persian claims. Even if Persia were able as a matter of historical fact to show that Bahrein had been Persian territory prior to 1783, the fact that she has never expressly recognised Bahrein’s independence affords, in our view, no foundation for her present claim. Vv r e agree with the arguments on this point in paragraphs 5 to 8 of Sir Austen Chamberlain’s letter of the 18th Februarv, 1929.^ i .* M L,P.L,Pyman, Esq., Foreign Office, S.W.I.

In the last sentence of paragraph 153/'the present Sheil^ referred/to Hamad though I have no doubt the statement /isis equally true of Salman. f (r. 02) It might be worth referring to the Persian decree of April 194-6 laying down that all petroleum products imported from Bahrein should be subject to the same dues and royalties as they levied on Anglo-Iranisn 0 «v Company products (see Tehran telegram ho.525 of the 18th April, 194-6). Q0 /4 reference might perhaps also be made to the report in Colonel Hay’s letter,No*674~S of 4th September, 1946, regarding the statement which the Persian Prime Minister made to the United States Ambassador^ to the effect that Persia based her claim mainly cm the British note of 1869 and that the Prime Minister did not at present propose to pursue the claim with the United Nations Organisation or the International /CourtY ^r.Harriann* The ^ hing wrong in this “eaoranda®.

Persian refusal to recognise passports visaed for Bahrein. The fact that the Ttersian claim to sovereignty over Bahrein is still maintained is, however, indicated by the refusal of the Bsrsian authorities to recognise as valid for Bsrsia the passports to any country bearing visas for Bahrein issued by British passport authorities. This difficulty has been ten$&gt;orarily circumvented by authorising British Consul at Basra to issue tenqporary passports valid for Persian-controlled territory only. The question has not been the subject of ary- correspondence or of diplomatic representation.“ U-x-uract from letter No.D.0.674-S from Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain to B#P.Donaldson Esq*, G*M.G.

The Prime Minister added that at present he did not propose to pursue the claim with the United Nations Organisation or the International Court of Justice as he thought it was unlikely to succeed owing to the strength of British influence in these bodies.I , | From To f, L£ COPY SECRET .

If Persia were to attempt a direct, unilateral reference of the matter to the new International Court of Justice, we should not in this particular case be bound to accept the jurisdiction of the court. This, however, applies only to a unilateral approach by Persia, independent of the United Nations Organisation; and we could always accept the Court’s jurisdiction if we wished. o. he cannot, on any legal or technical grounds, prevent Persia from raising the matter for discussion in either the General Assembly or the Security Council of the United Nations. With regard to the General Assembly, she would not have to do more than persuade it to deem the situation one ’’likely to imperil the general welfare or friendly relations among nations” (Article 14 of the Charter). There would then have to be a two- thirds majority of the members present and voting to allow the Assembly to recpmmend measures for a peaceful adjustment or (in all liklihood, though this is not specifically stated) to ask for an advisory opinion from / the E.P. Donaldson, Esq., C.M.G., India Office.the International Court of Justice* Alternatively the Assembly could, by the same majority, bring the matter to the notice of the Security Council as being 'likely to endanger international peace and security '(Article 11(5))* 4. For a direct approach to the Security Council Persia need only claim that the maintenance of international peace and security is threatened by the continuance of the dispute; (Articles 54 and 55 (l)). We cannot prevent the Council from investigating this contention, nor, if it aamita it, from proceeding f to recommend terms of settlement or refer the case to the International Court, We cannot exclude the possibility, remote as it may seem, that Persia might engineer a situation in which the Security Council would feel callea upon to make some recommendation; but she would have to obtain seven votes, including those of the remaining Great Powers. Any subsequent recommendation or reference to the Court would need a similar majority, but this would presumably be obtained if the earlier one had been. Neither we nor Persia would have any vote at this stage and we would have no 'veto' on the Councils decisions at any stage short of enforcement action against us. If Persia were a member of the Council, she would have a vote at the enforcement stage but no 'veto’d If Persia f s contention that the matter was one affecting T peace and security ? were not admitted, it is perhaps unlikely that the Council would deal with it further and in any case it cpnld then only make recommendations for a pacific settlement upon the request of both, parties* 5. Whatever the procedure adopted, a decision or recommendation unfavourable to us on the part of Assembly, Council, or Court would place us in a disastrous dilemma. A recommendation by the Assembly158 or an advisory opinion from the Court would not &lt; P ut us under any legal obligation to comply; but the moral obligation, strengthened by the two- thirds majority, would be overwhelming. If, on the other hand, the matter came before the Security Council as one considered likely to endanger international peace or security, the decisions of the Council would be legally binding upon us. This would include the case of the Council calling upon the parties to refer the matter to the Court; and of course any ensuing decision of the Court would be binding. The fact that, having- refused to comply y/e then proceeded to veto enforcement action against us, would not make us any less in breach of our obligations under the Charter; and although a single breach of this kind would not entail expulsion, the probable consequences of it are sufficiently oovious. The political consequences for us of complying with an adverse decision similarly need no elaboration. 6 . In considering possible courses of action the vital question for us should the matter go before the United Nations, is the political one-how the voting would go. Here the points raised in Cleary’s letter come in. Future developments may alter the outlook, but at present it seems to be this:- a) We must expect Soviet-controlled publicity to do all it can to embarrass us, at the same time using the situation to subvert iersia’s independence. As Cleary mentions, some references to the matter have been made already, but we think nothing can be done until Persia comes out into the open. Wiien it came to the point, however, the Soviet Union might oppose any decisive action by the United Nations for fear of setting up aprecedent to be used later against herself.matter fir the United Nations and expect us to submit to its arbitrament. c) A number of small states, out of or even baser motives, might enioy seeing The Arab states would naturally support • Thus our position for a political battle the United Nations is not altogether satisfactory. g disaster, a Persian victory, is a possibility, t^- ugh a remote one; and the mere discussion cu the guest on a political basis might involve us in difficulties. 7 . Caroe’s tentative suggestion, based teral that we should anticipate a dispute by a unilateral declaration 'vanning against interference in this region, is open to yet graver objections now than when it was first Out forward. Besides possibly alienating United States opinion, Sis or any tactic savouring of obstructionism would call down on us a storm of abuse and antl “; imperialist propaganda. We should be accused, , trying to cover up an indefensible case. ^ / - 8 . In the end, it is our legal right to Bahrein that we are relying on, and this the Law Officers opinion in 1934 declares to be practically unctssciliable. The safest and best course seems to be, now as - in lypo, to insist at the outset that the dispute is purely leg^l and ourselves propose that it be referred immediately and directly to the International Court of Justice. • e shcara . thei-ebv avoid political discussion in the Assembly or Council and have the matter settled once and for all. Purtnerraore, we should-thereby put Persia in the position of plaintiff, the more advantageous one of defendant accruing to ourselves, which would not De possiole otherwise i^for example, in obtaining an'advisory opinion). We should naturally have to be quite sure of our case, and a further review of it would be needed when the dispute seemed imminent. 9. Finally I think it is worth pointing out the danger of referring loosely to Bahrein as an 1 independenti state’. It is independent only in the internal or municipal sense, like one of the Malay States or Zanzibar; for international purposes it is simply a British protected state and just as much within the British Empire as those other states Since 1935 the Foreign Office has reached agreement with the India Office on this point, and we must make it clearly understood. Unless we do, it will be possible to argue that His Majesty’s Government has no right to speak for Bahrein, which, besides causing confusion, would damage our position in Bahrein itself. (C.W.

My dear sir Reader, a 1 sending you a translation of an article which appeared in the * Surush*, the Shiraz Tudeh paper. It is worth notice from the point of view that the writer has thought to bring Bahrain into Persian public notice again, and that there may possibly be something in. tho value of the Island of Kharg to the A.I.G.C. 2 . I am prompted to make this last remark since I have heard that the A.I.O.C. are looking for whet was described to me as a deep water sea frontage on the north-east shore of the Persian Gulf for the disposal of the southern oil-fields output. It is to be capable of handling as much shipping as the Abadan and Khosroabad jetties. ;4y informant told me that health experts had come out from home and had examined Bandar Pus bur and the proposed cantonment site some miles inland, and that both had been condemned. 3. Bushire was considered and though there is a deep water anchorage at Dastak, near Dushire, it is exposed to the northern storms, and so is unsuitable. The bar is a hindrance which prohibits the use of Bushire jjort itself. There is, however, a sheltered anchorage protected by the hills of Kharg where tugs lie up during storms, and it may be that the A.I.O.C. have sent a party to Kharg to investigate. I am only giving you this information for what it is worth, and as it was given over a drink I hope it will not be passed outside. 4. It Is a fact that Fathullah claims ownership of the islands on a Firman granted by Fath Ali Shah, and he has been attempting registration in his name. Incidentally Fathullah's father*s name was Haidar, and he was given a C.I.B. some time in the last war, Fathullah has no connection with us, but he was useful in maintaining Bushire 1 s wheat supply during the middle years of the war. 5. Glace drafting this letter-I have received a copy from the India Office of a telegram from the Embassy at Moscow from which It would appear that the article was also published in Moscow, It Is interest ing to note that Tudeh material is well received in Moscow. 6 .

WE PROTEST AGAINST REGISTRATION OF THE ISLANDS. The Persian Gulf is of vital importance to the (British) Imperialists and is an artery, vigilantly guarded by British diplomats, through which Khuzistan's oil wealth is bedng carried away, a bulwark defending India and a link connecting Basra and Bombay. The deep blue waters of the Gulf and the oil- producing barren islands have not interested the sensuous poets, but the keen eyes of the Conservative Diplomats of the Thames have been watchful the whole of every twentyfour hours. For centuries past the Persian Gulf has been a hot bed of diplomatic intrigue, and a field of economic exploitation by powerful alien Governments and Emperors. Britdin has always been the inevitable victor, succeeding in throwing out the Portuguese, the French, and the Germans. The British became the sole masters with great influence, and their Men-of-War and Merchant Navy plied freely in the Gulf. British diplomacy in the Gulf has been very seccessful in the past. It has gained for itself influence and has made much progress. What about the story of the capture of Bahrain ? They first encouraged the treacherous Shaikh to revolt, and then made a firm alliance with him. This is one of the ways they play their game in the Gulf. The Imperialists have never permitted Persia to build up a strong navy in the Gulf to safeguard even her own waters, and if she had ever considered doing this she would have been stopped by various means. The story of the Persian Gulf is very long but a more detailed article would require more time. This is only an introductory article relating to the two islands in the Gulf, Kharg and Khargu, which are being swallowed. Kharg and Khargu are two strategically important islands near Bushire, which can be well guarded from these two Islands. Kharg and Khargu like other coastal areas of the Gulf are dry and waterless, but, being In the oil-producing area, they may be considered as in the oil-belt of Persia. Since the time of the Portuguese, Kharg and Khargu have been of interest to the Imperialists and when Portugal was eliminated from the Gulf, the British became the overlords in the Gulf and the two islands were swallowed and only the fear of international repercussions kept them from being completely swallowed. .Kharg island wqs twice captured by the British in the time of Qajars but it was evacuated after the conclusion of a special treaty between Britain and Persia. The British Government once tried to purchase Kharg Island inf - 2 - ^&lt;4 ^ i; 05 i-f™*.' V K order to establish a Consulate on it, bJ failed Sh n / „ protect her influence on the island a ,‘-.

His life was Very 1 ? no ^ c l e ^r why his master did not p ay any attention to him. The result was that one of his coastal servants died in a miserable state. Allah Karam died and his skilful son Fathullah (who is now a millionaire; was badly off. In order to persuade our our statement it is sufficient to say that rathul...an eve unapplied to the Economic Department for a job m cne years 1318 and 1319 and was prepared to take any post on a salary of 170-250 tomans, ~ v 1 Fathullah’s luck turned when the. 20 th Hhahrivar crisis occurred. When Reza Khan escaped, his overlords again became in need of small servants. Hat Daudi was employed unofficially and was sent to Hiat Daud and Kharg Island. Fathullah’s arrival at Kharg synchronised with the mysterious death of Abdur Rasul, the Kadkhuda of Kharg Island. His wealth which he had earned by pearl fishing also mysteriously disappeared. The death of Abdur Rasul caused terror in the hearts of the inhabitants, but the Gend&amp;rnerie Department ignored the incident. Fathull^h commenced gathering some rifles, employed riflemen, and became a wealthy man. lie was employed to collect wheat at Bandar Rig and Dtlun. It must be borne in mind that a good harvest is available at the above places and the collections filled Fathullah* s purse with money from the monopoly. Hiat Daudi, however, rose to the occasion and he became even more powerful than his late father and evinced more sincerity and received gifts and presents (from his masters}. We are quite aware of the sMllof the British. They first feed the dog of the village and its Kadkhuda, and then plunder it. We knew that there must be some reason for fattening this chicken and we gave a hint in our paper though it turned out to be fruitless. We have now secretly heard of the intention of Fathullah to get the two islands registered in his name and it appears that the overlord is winking at this.We want to make this clear to tlie..,.it^0s4gr 0 f foreign Affairs so that the matter may not end like thaCBT-^th^^ahrain Islands. The registration of Kharg and Khargu is not very simple. There we see the hand of a man who has laboured. This man does not dare to take such steps alone. There is a plan for colon isation in this desire to register quietly the said two islands, so that later they can be leased from Hiat Daudi and perhaps a building erected in the name of some commercial house or other. Arrangements with Hiat Daudi could be made at leisure and the islands could be handed over, like Bahrain, because we do not consider the Hiat Baudis as faithful men. The Hiat Daudi Khans have a black record, and in any case we are suspicious about this registration of kharg. There is a hidden hand in it. warn the Government to be awake, the Registration Department to go slow and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be more careful in this matter.

My dear ft^lOn, le have been following; wjth much interest the correspondeace betwen trie India Office and the Foreigp Office on the subject of Bahrain ending with the Foreign Office letter No.5669/139/ 34 of the 6th November 1934 addressed to the India Office, v/e assume that the Poreigp Office are correct in their contentions (1) that His Majesty 1 1 Government could not effectively resist an attempt by the Persian Government to bring the case before the Council of tee League of Nations under either Article 11 or 15 of the Covenant. (2) That in that event the Council would insist on referr ing the question at issue either to the Permanent Court of Justice or to a Commttee of Jurists appointed hoc. On these assumptipns we are inclined to agree that the only policy open to us would be to accept the ppsition boldly and to hope, as we have every rigjit to do, for a favourable verdict aezi which would finally dispose of Persia's claim to Bahrain. On the other hand we are convinced that any such reference should^ if possible, be avoided both on account of the unfavourable political reactions which.have been pbinted out by Fowle in his demi-official letter No.1201-3. of 26th December 1934 and also because the possibility of a verdict favourable to Persia cannot be altogether excluded. The consequences of such a verdict could only be either the refusal of His Majesty's Government to implement the decision and their withdrawal from the League of Nations or the entire loss of our prestige and reputation for good faith in the Persian Gulf/...in* 17? Persian Gkalf coupled with the deprivation of the air .and naval facilities which we enjoy or expect to enjoy from the existing status of Bahrain# These are so serious that it seems to us desirable to explore every possible means of preventing Persia from bringing the matter before the Gouncil and we therefore venture to piit forward ^.e follow ing suggestion. | c | 0^5 2. It will be remembered that in rely to the United States* proposals for the conclusion of the Kellogg Pact, His Majesty’s Uoyeromerftnsent a note dated tna 19th May 1928 tetherTMW&lt;HStates they could not tolerate interference by Foraign^ Govsmiients in certain regions and that protection against attacks in these regions was to the British Empire a measure of self-defence. The full text of that paragraph is as follows: c 'The language of Artiola 1 as to the renunciation of war as an instruoant of sun national policy renders it desirable that I should remind Your Excellency that there are certain regions of the world the welfare and integrity of which constitute a special and vital interest for our peace and safety, His Majesty’s. Government have been at pains to make it clear in the past tot interference with these regions cannot be suiiared. Their protection against attacks is to the British Empirea measure of self-defence. It must be olearl understood that His Majesty's Government in.Great Britain accept the new treaty upon the distxnct understanding that it does not prejudice their freedom of action in this respect. The 'Government of the United States have comparable interests, any disregard of which by a B’oreign Power they have declared tot they would rej^rd as an unfriendly act. His Majesty's Government believe therefore that/r 112 that in dafandiig their position they are express ing the intention and meaning of the United States Government. 1 * 3. In the United States* reply to this note no mention was made of this reservation and the whole Question was therefore examined in a Foreign Office Memorandum dated the 29th June 1928, in which the conclusion was reached that any unilater al declaration of Mils kind at the time of sxgja&amp;t signature of the Kellogg Pact relating to our position in Fgupt and the Persian Gulf would t rovoke considerable opposition in the United tates and might well creat^dlfficulties in the United States Senate* It is presumed that no such declaratipn was therefore actually made at the time of signature, but it appears that the text of paragraph 10 quota d above was subsequently communicated to the Secretary General, League of Nations, Geneva, with the request that copies might be circulated to all Members of the Leagie (vide Foreign Office letter No.5360/1/45 dated the 4th August 1928- addressed to the Sec rutary General, League of Nations, Geneva). It occurs | to us that it might be possible new for some such I unilateral declaration to be made by His Majesty 1 s 1 Government with regard to the Arab Shaikhdoms : in the Persian Gulf in the hope that such a declaration would make it clear both to Persia and to the Members of the League that His Majesty’* Government were not prepared to acquiesce in any interference with the existing status of those principalities by the intervention of * ^ International Tribunals. It is true that at the *ti me °f aafe'B&amp;ute' of the Kellogg Pact the matter / for consideration was not one of reference of a dispute relating,^ to such regions to an internat ional tribunal, out was rather a question of interpretationinterpretation of an article of tha treaty relating to renunciation of war as applied to those, tegions# Nevertheless the principle laid do^n imparagraph 10 was perhaps wide enough to cover both,. Oases. 4. It may of course be argued tlrt a declaration of this kind would merely annoy Perm^and drive them into doing the very thi wfeiohi ^4rii ah 1 to avoid, namely, an appeal to tlie League of Nation* It might also create complications with Ibn Saud who is i; dined to claim political inf luence over and connection with all Arab Principalities. It mi^it even arouse opposition from the United States and from European Powers who have treaty relations with some of these Principalities. On the other hand, as it appears to us, it would strength I our position in the &amp;ulf and make us and our g proteges less liable to attacks of. the kind now anticipated, whereas acquiescence in reference to a Tribunal, apart from the otter consequences apprehended, might well expose us to similar claims for reference ol awkward questions elsewhere, as for instance in Egypt or the Sudan. In making the declaration we could refer to the statement which we made to the United States and comnunicated to otter signatories of the Kellogg Pact in 1928. I am not sending copies of this letter to Fowl© as tie suggestion may be regarded by His Majesty 4 a government as entirely impossible, s but it would of course be necessary to consult him ii it was decided to pursue the idea further.

The first of these appeared on the 7th January in Dary a, which is one of the organs of the Tudeh Party. The paper maintained that Bahrain belonged to rersia and that the British G-overmment had, by implication, . ’ * # accepted in 1935 Persian sovereignty over the islands. It did not want the Persian people to feel that the British Government had anv territorial designs on Persia. If for war purposes foreign troops were stationed In various parts of Persia, including Bahrain, it believed that these troops would evacuate Bahrain within 6 months D^M^ie end of the war as provided by the Tripartite treaty. It then went on to ask the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs how Persian authority was exercised in Bahrain. It mentioned the im portance of Bahrain to Great Britain as a station for Imperial Air ways (s ic) on the route to India. Darya was suppressed a day or two later because of a particu larly virulent attack on this country. Its place was then taken by Nid ay-i-Haq1q at which, on the Ilth January, returned to the charge, saying that Bahrain was an inseparable p?art of Persia, that the British Government had violated Persia’s rights over the islands, and that the agreements between the Shaikh of Bahrain and the Amer ican oil company were illegal. • Yours sincerely,5h5o j 1940 j 3453.

Monsieur le Ministre, Referring to my letter of 23/III/1316 (No.12928/1159),* I have the honour to inform you that, according to further informa tion which has reached me, acts contrary to Iran's sovereign rights are still proceeding in the Bahrein Islands. It appears, indeed, that the enactment of the regulations concerning landed property , 5 against which I protested in my previous letter, has been effected with the sole object of creating difficulties for Iranians who are not natives of Bahrein, but who, like those of the Islands, live and have houses and property there. In protesting, there fore, against these proceedings, of which the British Government is certainly not unaware, and which are quite contrary to Iran's sovereign rights over those Islands, I desire to inform Your Excellencv that the said proceedings cannot in any way prejudice the legitimate rights of the Imperial Government over the Bahrein Islands, and that they cannot be regarded as proof of the inde pendence of Bahrein or as proof that Great Britain has special rights there. A copy of this letter will be communicated to the League of Nations.

Persian Minister stated that he was to inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs that his Government considered Bahrain to be an integral part of the Persian Umpire and would hold the participation of the Iraqi Government in any such discussions to be an act unbecoming in a friendly neighbour state. Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that there was no truth in the report that the Sheikh of Bahrain was coming to Bagdad and that in any case the dispute between the Persian Government and His Majesty’s Government about Bahrain was not one in which the Iraqi Government had any concern. I told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that, inasmuch as the Iraqi Government were conscripting Bahrainis on the ground that they were ex-Ottoman subjects, I thought that his reply might have gone a little further.

This is the reason why we see ail countries ana waters situated between Britain anu India have become more or less under the influence and protection of Britain. The T.&amp;nsh se? (English Channel),Pacific Ocean, Gibraltar have come under the domination of the British. The British Naval influence in the Mediterranean oea is even more than those powers which are situated on the coast of this sea. In Egyptian water, I'uez Canal, Red Sea, Bab el Mandcib, there exists no foreign influence but the British. The domination of this naval Government in the T Ira^i coast ana the Arabian Peninsula is extraordinary. And it is for this only that Britain tried from the beginning and is trying to extend their influence on the Persian Gulf waters in order to bring the Islands ana places situated between Arabia, ! Ira&lt;i and Indian waters under their control. In the past trie men urovenuaent of Iran who had no news even of the capital how could it be possible for her to know about the distant places, of the country. The Bri tosh (Government/were doing what ever they liked in our waters.

Despite the expectation of powers seeking for colonies there appeared a leader and rescuer who was able to give life to the soulless Ira^, protecting our national interests and affairs in the interior of the country and abroFd. Gradually he put an end to the tribal chief corns of the past and die farthest spots of the country became under the control, of the Central Government. The Persian Gulf islands also joined the mother of the country one after another. The Bahrain Islands which are one of the Gulf 1. lands a ,d inseparable part of Iran were expected to become u -der the control of Iran but it is regretted that the British have not yet agreed to desist from their colonial intrigues, i rom one side they ere adhering to their treaties concluded witn the Dhnikue appointee by thef.tselves anu have taken these torn papers as their documentary proof and with these documents they hold themselves as protectors of the is lands, their interests fjid Dhaikhs.

I am told by Smart, the Oriental Secretary in Cairo, that this paper is old- established, deals mainly with Persian affairs and is run by a Persian. It has no circulation in Egypt, but has some influence in Iraq and Persia 5. I agree with you that this article, of' 253 4. the League of Nations anc the last diplomatic friendly measures of Iran have proved fruitless* The British try to bring, as soon as possible, Bahrain islanus under their complete control. It is obvious that the Imperial Government of Iran, under instructions of our crowneu father, was desirous to hive a peaceful policy ma to Beetle its political difficulties in &amp; friendly way. It was for this reason that they adhered to legal means und produced the case before the League of La lions and in the meanwhile correspondence had been e changed between the Imperial Government and the British Government. But it seems that our peaceful way has been construed as weakness sma inability otherwise there would have been some effect to it. The friendly ana peaceful manner has always good effect in international policy but in the meantime it might bring about extraordinary dangerous injuries. .For exswle, titer the Great ar and the victory of the cities, Italy who considered herself a partner in the war booties, tried her best to obtain from the said wax'* booties her share or at least a part of it but could not succeed. Because ' Italy which at that time was confronted with a range of interna.i difficulties and even the tribal chiefs were so powerful as to conquer it at any moment, had no power to brin^ her ri iitful requests into effect ©nd no one,therefor* attended to her statement. Then the past time was over and Italy was strengthened under the leadership and dictatorship of Musolinni, the nations still were not prepared to enter into a peaceful way with her. In consequence/-5. conse tunee the dictator of Italy, depending; on his financial power, naval, air and Military forces, dreaiaed for the only indepenedent country in Africa, that is, Abyssinia. His dream was also,as a result of efforts m&amp;e by the Italian forces, interpreted. To-day Abyssinia, despite the lorn-; protests of the Bovernments particularly the British, came under the fla^ of Italy. Before IUiy Japan started a heart broken cry siyi% 0 f nations, so many millions of the population of my country sleep on the coastal boats on acckunt of want of room on the islands.

J'aps.n's cry wits not heard by anyone but by themselves. Consequently Japsn discontin ued tue peaceful policy with the nations, occupied Manchuri* with her military force and did n^t e&amp;re for the protests of the nations. She is now comfortably increasing her national interests ana has nothing to do with others. She dared, however, say that she is in need of China und china is in need of her, 'Cnarity begins at home', because it is possible that a Durope&amp;n Government might corae to ^sia and occupy such a vast country like India ane she (Japan/ should sit t uiet while China is t.vo inches distant from her s.nd when a -uropean nation came and occupied China whose political ami internal conditions are not better than India, she Japan) bus t put her linger in the mouth ana look at what is going on. The Rhine parts which be Ion, to Germany were occupied by the allies forces after the war and it was under their occupation until a few years ago* At last the sallies withdrew tueir/-u* their military force after fifteen years from tnere. in this period, howsoever, Germany shouteu, inisis our land, the finine parts are a part of Germany, why should it be unprotected* ho one cared for her statement, .then they com pie t --d SXXXK their forces, they occupiea tne saia place .vith an international ci star banc e nd as tnere was an air force reauy to protect the mitionai nonour* nothing movcc from its place. Only long and detailed protests of France and others a re kept in the records of the League of nations to-day. In our opinion the peaceful policy ox the Imperial ‘Government of Iran in restoring its political right in ■is a rain islands has seen met vitil cclones.- and no weight has been given to it.

Dated Simla, the August 1936. Description of Bahrain as Iranian territory on passports issued by Foreign Consuls in Bombay. -^ 0 I am directed to state that some cases have been brought to the notice of the Government of India in which foreign consular officers in Bombay, while endorsing the passports of their nationals for Bahrain, have shown Bahrain as a part of Iran. in a recent case the Bushire Residency brought to the notice of the Government of India that the Chinese Consul in Bombay had given such an endorsement on a Chinese passport of a Chinese subject who went to Bahrain. A visa for Bahrain was then given on this passport by the Passport Officer to the Government of Bombay. The Government of India asked the Bombay Government to bring it to the notice of the Chinese Consul that Bahrain was in no way connected with Iran. In reply, the Government of Bombay have suggested that a general notice should be Issued to all foreign consuls in Bombay to the effect that Bahrain is an independent Arab/ The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India,- 2 - P Arab Shaikhdora and is neither geographically nor otherwise connected with Iran and it should not be shorn as such on passports. 2. If the Government of India should issue a circular to all foreign consuls as proposed, the question would arise whether the Iranian consul should be Included in the distribution list. it seems probable that on receipt of such a circular the Consuls of States other than Iran would make enquiries from the Iranian Consul, and if he had not been included in the distribution list, this fact would arouse suspicion in the minds of other Consuls as to the genuine nature of our claim that Bahrain was not a part of Iran. It would therefore seem necessary to include him. in either case therefore the action proposed would tend to force the issue and raise the vexed question of sovereignty over Bahrain. 3. The Government of India are therefore inclined to the view that this course should not be adopted, and, after consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, would propose the following alternative action. Entry into Bahrain cannot be secured on a foreign passport without the visa of a British passport authority acting on behalf of the Ruler of Bahrain. The Government of India suggest that instructions should be issued to all British passport authorities issuing such visas prohibiting the grant of visas on foreign passports which show Bahrain as in any way connected with Iran. These instructions might suitably be included in paragraph 9 of the Foreign&amp; - 3 - omce draft circular received with the India Office letter no. P^ZOgge/,^ dated the 1st April 1935, and comraunicated to His Majesty’s Consular Officers abroad. Individual cases of such refusal would he brought to the notice of the foreign consular officer concerned, a course which would not be likely to raise the general issue to the same degree as would a circular addressed to all foreign consular officers. Should the Iranian consular authorities in India or else- ■ where then seek to grant Iranian visas on the passports of nationals of other States for Bahrain, thus claiming Bahrain as a part of Iran, such a document m&gt;uld not he regarded as valid or as sufficient to obtain ingress to Bahrain. 4. The Government of India would he grateful if they could kindly he favoured with the views of His Majesty’s Government on these suggestions.

' * ^ As for the Karim Khan period,, there is doubtless something to be found in the archives of the East India Co.; I have, so far, only had time to study the portion of these records relating to the time of the Afghan domination and to Nadir Shah»s reign. You will notice that I have referred to a recent Arabic history of Bahrain, viz. At-Tuhfatu»n-Nabhaniyyat; this work has to be used with caution, as it contains many errors. I have no knowledge of the arguments on which the Iranian Government bases its claim to Bahrain; if it relies upon historical grounds, all I can say is that it has a very weak case. In fact, Iran might, on such grounds, equally well claim the return of Baku and Derbend from the U.S.S.R. or of Herat and Qand&amp;har from Afghanistan! I will conclude by emphasising that I am sending these notes in my private capacity end not as an employee of the A.P.O.C!

Yours sincerely.THE IRMIM CLAIM TO BAHRAIN: AN HISTORICAL SUMMARY I« From early times to 1718 The early history of Bahrain is wrapped in some obscurity, but it seems that the Sasanian kings of Iran exercised sovereignty over the islands for some 400 years. In the early days of Islam, that is, about the middle of the 7th century A.D., the Arabs conquered Bahrain and imposed their new faith upon the inhabitants just as they did in Iran. Thenceforward, for nearly three centuries, Bahrain formed part of the dominions of, successively, the Orthodox, Umayyad and c Abbasid Caliphs. In the Jrd century of the Hijra (10th century A.D.) Bahrain was held for a time by the heretical sectaries known as the Qaramita or Carmathians; later, various Arab tribes obtained possession, one after the other. After the conquest of Baghdad snd the overthrow of the‘Abbasid Caliphate by the Mongols in 1258 A.D., Bahrain was for some time governed by rulers set up by the Mongols. Towards the close of the 14th century A.D. the islands were overrun by the forces of Timur—i—Lang (Tamer-Lane), the Turivish conqueror from Central Asia, and were added to his vast dominions. After the break-up of this heterogeneous and short-lived empire, Bahrain became, for sn indeterminate period - possibly 50 or 60 years - part of the territory of the semi-independent kings of Hormuz, who did lip-service to th rulers of Iran. Thus once again, though this time only nominally, Bahrain became Iranian. Early in the 16th century A.D. the Portuguese captured Bahrain from the King of Hormuz, and held it until 1622, when, after their defeat at Hormuz by a combined English snd Iranian force, they were forced to relinquish their grip The islands then became, for nearly a century, pcit oi t- e Safavi Empire of Iran.II. From 1717 to 0116 01 the signs of the impending collapse of the Safavi dynasty was the inability of the Government, under the feeble Shah Sultan Husain, to maintain its authority in me i ersxan Gulf m the opening years of the eighteenth century. In 1717 or early in the following year 1 the Imam of Muscat Sultan ibn Saif II, who had a powerful fleet 2 , seized the Bahrain islands; it appears that he met with little or no opposition. Sultan ibn Saif aiea in 1719? and the * Omani Arabs apparently evacuated Bahrain shortly afterwards; it is said that the inhabitants (whom the Sultan had evicted) then returned to thar homes5. Very soon after the disappearance of the 'Omanis/ Shaikh Jab bar a, the head of the formidable Huwala Arabs, who was nominally an Iranian subject, occupied Bahrain and securely established his authority there for a number of years. In the period of the Afghan domination, nothing was done to dispossess Shaikh Jahbara, who, it seems, achieved complete independence. It was not until the strong hand of Nadir^ assumed control of the Government, that IT There is some uncertainty as to this date. It is unfortunate that there is a hiatus in the Gombroon records of the East India Company from 1705 to 1718. 2 . Particulars of the strength of this fleet as it was in 1715 a re given by Captain Alexander Hamilton in his 'New Account of the East Indies' (Edinburgh, 1727* Vol. I. P. 74). ^ • Hamilton, op. cit .. Vol. I. p. 72. 4. Strictly speaking, it is not correct to use the name 'Nadir' until 1736. Nadir Shah was originally known as Nadr (or Nadhr) Quli Beg; in 1726 Tahmasp Shah, after the capture of Mashhad, gave him the title of Tahmasn Quli Khan. On deposing Tahmasp in August 1732, abandoned this title and became known officially as Wakilu'd-Daula and as Na'ibu's-Saltana while he acted as Regent for the infant Shah 'Abbas III. In March 1736 Nadir deposed 'Abbas and assumed the title of Shah himself.- 3 - measures were taicen to force the Arabs of the Garmsirat or Hot Countries to submit; many of these tribesmen had been taking full advantage of the lack of power of the Central Government to raid and plunder to their hearts, content. At Nadir*s express orders, however, the Arabs on the eastern side of the Persian Gulf were reduced to obedience, and in May 1734 even the powerful Shaikh Jabbara found it politic to submit. He even lent vessels to the Government in oraer to assist in the capture of the rebel Muhammad Khan Baluch who had escaped to the island of Qais. Shaikh Jabbara, however, maintained his hold over Bahrain, and, ds the Iranians had as yet no fleet, they could do nothing to dispute his authority there. Nadir had already resolved to have a fleet of his ancl by means ° r purchase (the transactions were generally of a forced nature) he obtained several vessels within the next twelve months. Though Latif Khan, Nadir ! s Admiral, failed in an attack on Basra in April 1735 1 , he was able, a year later, to seize Bahrain. One of the ships that took part in this expedition was the former East India Company vessel, n No r thumb er 1 and !! . The compiler of the »Precis containing Information in regard to the first Connection of the Hon f ble East India Company with Turkish Arabia* (Calcutta, 1874) unaccountably omits to make any specific reference to this attack, although it caused for a time such complications for the Company. (This is the incident referred to on page 19 of the * Precis 1 as 'the unlucky affair at Bussorah') When news of the entry of the Iranian fleet into the Shatt- al-»Arab reached the Turkish authorities at Basra, they promptly seized two East India Company vessels that were lying there, manned them with troops (despite the protests of the Resident) and sent them downstream against the enemy. After a brisk engagement, the Iranian fleet was defeated. The use of these English vessels in this way threatened for a time to have grave consequences for the Agent at Gombroon, even though the Company ! s hand had been forced by the Turks; fortunately. Nadir*s desire to obtain ships through the Company led him to forego any retaliatory mea sures. (Particulars of the seizure of the vessels and of the naval engag ement in the Shatt-al-* Arab are given in a letter from Martin French, the Resident, to London, dated 5th June 1755^ i n Volume XV of the E.I.Co.*s records at the India Office, 'Persia and the Persian Gulf' series.- 4 - 285 4. At-Tuhfatu T n-Nabhaniyyat, page 114. The moment chosen for this descent upon Bahrain was opportune, because Shaikh Jabbnra was absent at that time on a pilgrimage to Mecca. His deputy offered some resistance but was soon obliged to yield!. Thus Iranian authority was once more completely established over the islands. It would seem to be a difficult juridical problem to ascertain for how long (if, indeed, at all) during the years 1718 - 1736 Iran could claim even the shadow of de .jure authority there. Shaikh Jabbara, in virtue of his tribal territories on the mainland, was, nominally at any rate, a vassal of Iran, but did he acknowledge the suzerainty of the Shah over Bahrain? Also, if he did so, was it, during the period 1722 - 1730, the suzerainty of the Afghan sovereigns or that of the shadow-Shah Tahmasp II which he recognised? Presumably the only way to furnish proof of any Iranian overlordship would be to show that tribute or taxes were paid by the Shaikh in respect of Bahrain 2 * It is interesting to note that it was, apparently, the successful outcome of this Bahrain expedition which led the Admiral, Latif Khan, to suggest to Nadir the more ambitious project of conquering and annexing 1 Oman^. On regaining the islands. Nadir is said to have had a strong fortress, knofi/n as the Qal f atu T d-Diwan, built on Manama 4 .

The latter book 2. is by Muhammad Ibnu* sh-Shaikh Khalifa Ibn Hamadi f n-Nabhan. It seems to be in the highest degree unlikely that the Iranian Government could furnish documentary proof of any such payment. The only paym&amp;it made by Shaikh Jabbara to the Government was, so far as I am aware, one of 10,000 tomans in May 1754; Shaikh Jabbara did not pay all this sum himself, but collected most (if not all) of it from the coasta.1 tribes as a line for sundry acts of piracy, banditry and rebellion, p. Gombroon Diary, 2nd February 175o»mere appears to be nothing further on record respecting Ben-.m „ tll and in his absence Taqi Khan y the Beglarbeg of Fars,was in control of affairs in the Persisji Gulf. Taqi Khan was a most corrupt administrator, and put into his own pockets money destined for the pay of the seamen and for their rations. The consequence was that many seamen, disgusted with their treatment, deserted. The first 'Oman campaign came to/inglorious end in the summer of 1738, and the fleet suffered a serious loss when Taqi Khan, after qucSrelling with the Admiral, Latif Khan, had him poisoned. Deprived of their Admiral and ill-paid and half—starved, the seamen who remained in the Iranian service were in no condition to fight. The natural consequence was that the Muscat Arabs and others regained the command of the sea. An Arab fleet arrived off Basidu in July 1738, and plundered the tom and killed all the Iranians there. Word was received in Gombroon at the # *i same time x that the Arabs of Bahrain had revolted and were besieging the Iranian garrison in the citadel (doubtless the Qal f atu'd-Diwan). Later in the year the Arabs were weakened by interna] dissentions* and in January 1739* when an engagement took place / between the Arab and Iranian fleets, the Admiral of the former w r as blown up and his vessels dispersed. The Iranians in Bahrain were, apparently, relieved about this time 2 . Later in the year 1739 came the disastrous Iranian expedition to Gwa^dar, and in September 1740 there was a very serious mutiny in the Iranian fleet. The Admiral, ' Gombroon Diary, 26th July, 1738. 2. There is no actual record to this effect, but it is known that the Iranian garrison was besieged again in 1740.ifar All Shan by name, was murdered, and all the ships were removed by the mutineers to Khor Fatal; later, some of the vessels were taken to Qais. The Huwala. Arabs, ever ready to fish in troubled waters, threw in their lot with the mutineers. In November 1740 the combined Arab fleets appeared off Cong, and in December Shaikh Jabbara landed on Bahrain and besieged the Iranian garrison. vvhen Nadir heard of the nava .1 mutiny and of the rebellion of the Huwalas, he ordered troops to be sent and money to be raised for the suppression of the trouble. Without ships, nothing, however, could be done, and it was not until early in 1742 that Nadir had collected enough vessels to regain supremacy at sea. Meanwhile, it appears that the Iranian garrison on Bahrain had been relieved by 'K. V Oasim Ib^f Jabi^ of f Asalu, who expelled the besieging Huwalas 2 . Thereafter, until after Nadiras death, Bahrain remained an indisputed possession of Iran. In the chaotic period following Nadir’s assassination in 1747 Bahrain experienced many vicissitudes. Another Shaikh of 1 Asalu, Muhammad Ibn Jabir (probably a brother of Qasim), seized the islands but was soon dispossessed of them by Mir Nasir, of Bandar Rig^and Shaikh Nasir, of Bushire^. Finally, Shaikh Nasir obtained sole possession, but it is not clear whether he held Bahrain in fief from the Iranian crown or in his own right. In 1761 Shaikh Nasir was confirmed by Karim Khan as Governor of the Garmsirat or Hot Countries^, and it may be that Karim Khan was strong enough either then or later to enforce his author ity over Bahrain. 1# The Gombroon Diary gives many particulars of this mutiny; Otter also refers to it in his ’Voyage en Turquie et en Perse’, Paris, 1748. Vol. II., pp. IfO and 1^1, but his account is neither so full nor so accurate as that of the Gombroon Diary. 33! 2 and 5*jj^ et&gt;uhrt s tBeschreibung von Ar&amp;bien’, C’hagen, I772*p«j^)- Saldanha’s ’Selection from State Papers, Bombay, regarding the East India Co.’s connection wuth the Persian Gulf’, Calcutta, 1908 , p. 147.After Karim Khan’s death in 1779 another period of anarchy occurred, and in 1783 the islands fell an easy prey to the 'Otuba tribe, who came from the mainland of Arauia. Since that time Iranian sovereignty has never been nf? , iwinna-i7Tjl:But&gt;. in Bahrain. It will be clear from the foregoing that it is impossible to be precise as to the aggregate period from the beginning of the Sasanian rale up to the present day during which Iran can claim to have held undisputed sway over Bahrain. If we take 400 years during the Sasanian epoch, 50 for that of the Kings of Hormuz, 96 for the occupation after the Portuguese collapse in 1622 and, say. 40 (perhaps a generous estimate) Sssa^the years I7p6 to 1783 we get a total of 586 years. What is most important is that it is now over 1^0 years since the Iranians were last in occupation of the islands. 22nd May, 19l5«•jp ? / ■ * £ . Ij . P A RI o p /f P.

We assume that the Foreign Office are correct in their contentions (l) that His Majesty^ Government could not effectively resist an attempt by the Persian Government to bring the case before the Council of the League of Nations under either Article 11 or 15 of the Covenant. (2) That in that event the Council would insist on referring the question at issue either to the Permanent Court of Justice or to a Committee of Jurists appointed ad hoc . On these A‘ assumptions we are inclined to agree that the only policy open to us would be to accept the position boldly and to hope, as we have every right to do, for a favourable verdict which would finally dispose of Persia’s claim to Bahrain.

These are so serious that it seems to us desirable to explore Qtg ry possible means of preventing Persia from bringing the matter before the Council and we therefore venture to put forward the following suggestion* It will be remembered that in reply to the United States 1 proposals for the conclusion of the Kellogg Pact, His Majesty^ Government sent a note dated the 19th JiTay 1928 to the United States Ambassador in London generally accepting the suggestions but pointing out in paragraph 10 that they could not tolerate interference by Foreign Governments in certain regions and that pro tection against attacks in these regions was to the British Empire a measure of self-defence* ihe full text of that paragraph is as follows! *The language of Article 1 as to the renunciation of * •In any further communication on this subject, please quote no. e 5669/139/34 and address— not to any person by name. but to— “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.l.

S W 1# t&gt;th November, 1934 * c ff iv/. / Jr Sir, WO The I am directed by Secretary sir John Simon to inform you that he has considered your letter PZ.5602/34 of 8th September, setting forth the views of Secretary sir Samuel Hoare upon the attitude which Hie Majesty's Government should adopt in the event of the Persian claims to Bahrain, Tamb and Abu Musa being referred to the League of Nations* 2. Although this question has now become less urgent, through the failure of the Persian Government to raise the question of these claims during the recent sessions of the Council and Assembly of the League, it would nevertheless be imprudent to assume that they will not do so in some form or other in the future, and even in the near future* In that event it would be clearly undesirable that His Majesty’s Government should not be in a position to issue instructions at short notice to their representatives at Geneva, and it is with the object of expediting a decision upon the form which these instructions should take that Sir John Simon desires me to explain his reasons for hesitating to endorse certain of the suggestions contained in your letter* The eventuality discussed in paragraph 2 of that letter, i*e* a passing reference to the claim by the Persian delegate in a general discussion before the Assembly, presents no difficulty* It is the reply of His Majesty’s Government to a direct appeal to the League which needs to be determined* rn pY 9 _. t u &gt; y &gt; Dhder-Secretary of State, Q pV India Office* Df tr^^Trforward i CarefUlly C ° nSidered the Put t j: PamgraPh S ° f ^ ^ - -a iM conv^ea e event of the Persian Government bringing the matter before the Connci! under either A rtic le ii or Article lg of the Covenant, it .ouXd not be possible to prevent the Council from going into the merits of the case c- me case. so far as concerns action under Article 15, while sir John Simon agrees that it might be possible to argue that the dispute was not in practice likely to lead to a rupture, he fears that this line of argument would not be open to the Representative of the United Kingdom. Then the Council was dealing with the Sino- Japanese dispute in March 1932, it was stated by the then President, the Representative of Prance, (League of Nations Official Journal, March, 1932, page 340) that: 'it is not for the Council, when a request has been 'submitted to it under Article 15 of the Covenant, 'to decide whether this request is justified. in 'accordance with Article 15 it is sufficient for one 'of the parties - if a Member of the League - to 'notify the Secretary-General of a dispute, for the 'latter to be compelled to make all necessary 'arrangements for a full investigation and 'consideration thereof.' This statement was based upon an opinion given by a Committee of Jurists in connexion with the Corfu incident, which was subsequently endorsed by the Council; it is possible that the President’s statement went somewhat beyond the Jurists’ Opinion, but it nevertheless constitutes a precedent which, in Sir John Simon’s opinion, would almost certainly be followedy e Council in analogous circumstances, so that in the event of the Persian Government bringing the present question before the Council under Article 15 the Council would feel itself bound to embark at on op* once upon the procedure of investigation and considexution of the question prescribed by that article. Moreover the Council would certainly remember that His Majesty's Government recently brought the Anglo-Persian Oil Company case before that body under Article 15, and in so doing relied on the view that Persia was not entitled to dispute the .jurisdiction of the Council on the ground that the matter was not really a serious one* 4. In the event, however, of the Persian Government electing to bring the matter before the Council under Article 11 it would be unnecessary for them to describe the dispute as one which is 'likely to lead to a rupture', since it would suffice to show that there existed 'any circumstance whatever affecting 'international relations which threatens to disturb international 'peace and the good understanding between nations upon which ,f peace depends#' Sir John Simon cannot doubt that the Council would consider the matter one which it could properly deal with under Article 11# Not only has the Persian claim and its rejection by His Majesty’s Government been brought to the notice of Members of the League on several occasions by documents which have been communicated to them, but it is material to bear in mind that in view of the recent Persian action at Tamb and Abu Musa, His Majesty’s Government have found it necessary to issue instructions to their naval authorities in the Persian Gulf which contemplate in the last resort the defence of the rights of the Sheikh by force, and have informed the Persian Government/Government verbally that they have done so. The position is somewhat similar in regard to Bahrain where His Majesty’s Government are under treaty obligations to protect the Sheikh against aggression hy sea. There is therefore always the possibility of ill-advised Persian action resulting in an incident which, even if it were not sufficiently grave to place His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government under an obligation to submit it to the Council under Article 15 as being likely to lead to a rupture, would certainly be held to justify a reference to the Council under Article 11. But even supposing that no such incident takes place, if the Persian Government were to bring the existing situation before the Council under Artiale 11 and to refer, in justification of their action, to the communication which Sir Reginald Hoare has made to them in accordance with the instructions contained in Foreign Office telegrams Nos, 92 and 93 of 2bth September (since, although that communication applied only to the specific cases \ of Tamb and Abu Musa, the Persian Government could reasonably assume that it could be regarded a fortiori as indicating the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards possible Persian action at Bahrain), Sir John Simon considers it as certain that the Council would feel it incumbent upon them to deal with the matter, and he finds it difficult to see how any suggestion to the contrary could seriously be put forward by the Representative of the United Kingdom® 5® For the above reasons Sir John Simon is convinced that it would be impossible in practice to prevent the Council from investigating the dispute and that any attempt on behalf of His Majesty’s Government to prevent them from doing so would not only fail, but would be extremely likely to antagonise the Council,/Council. As regards the suggestion aade in the last sentence of paragraph 3 of your letter, Sir John Simon fears that unless it were expressly stated to refer only to the period during which the dispute was before the Council, the suggested statement would be read as an intimation that whatever the result of the proceedings before that body, His Majesty’s Government intended to maintain the present position, if necessary by force,- and, if so, it is difficult to imagine an action which would be better calculated to prejudice the position of His Majesty^s Government in the eyes of public opinion, and to dispose the Council to look with favour on the Persian contentions. 6. Sir John Simon does not mean to suggest that it would not be desirable for the United Kingdom Representative to take the earliest possible opportunity of impressing upon the Council the essential weakness of the Persian claim and the strength of the historical and legal arguments which can be adduced against it* It might even be possible to invite the Council to say that having heard both sides they had found the Persian claim to be supported by no valid evidence or arguments, and to reject it without further enquiry. But Sir John Simon fears that any such attempt would be most unlikely to succeed* as soon as the contentions of the two parties had been laid before the Council, it would become apparent that the main, if not the only, issue, in the case was a pure question of law, i.e* whether the Persian claim to sovereignty over the islands in question was well-founded or not, and it may be regarded as certain that the Council would not be prepared to decide the matter without first having the legal issue examined and reported on by some competent body* 7* m these circumstances there would be three possible courses open to the Council* It might (on the assumption tnat neither/neither party is entitled to take the case to the Permanent Court under the Optional Clause) endeavour to induce the parties to consent to a reference to the Court by special agreement • or it might ask the Court for an Advisory Opinion^ or it might seek the advice of a committee of Jurists appointed ad hoc, ' i 1 i 8, If the first course were adopted and agreed to the proceedings before the Council would presumably terminate and the question of the Persian claim would be settled by the decision of the Permanent Court, In view of the Opinion given by the Law Officers as regards the Persian claim to Bahrain, and on the assumption that the Persian claim to Tamb and Abu Musa is no stronger, Sir John Simon cannot believe that the Court would not decide in favour of the contention of His ^ Majesty’s Government, But in view of the suggestion in \ paragraph 4 of your letter that it may be necessary to consider the possibility of His Majesty’s Government declining absolutely to implement a decision by the Court, Sir John Simon would point out that under Article 15 (4) of the Covenant, His Majesty’s Government are bound to ’’carry out in full good faith ’’any award or decision that may be rendered”, and that, under the same paragraph ”in the event of any failure to carry out such ”an award or decision, the Council shall propose what steps ’’should be taken to give effect thereto”. In these circumstances a proposal to violate this obligation, involving as it would a complete departure from the policy which His Majesty s Government have consistently pursued in relation to the League, and possibly their withdrawal from that body, is a matter which could only be considered by the Cabinet, 9, If either of the other two courses indicated above were adopted, the Council would still have to deal with the matter after/1 after it had received the Advisory Opinion of the Court or the report of the Committee of Jurists. Prom the point of vie, put forward in paragraphs 5 and t&gt; of your letter there is therefore no difference between these two courses of action, except that a report by an ad hoc committee of jurists would carry less weight than an Advisory Opinion by the Court. From the point of view of the possibilities of success, Sir John Simon feels no doubt that in the interests of His Majesty’s Government a reference to the Permanent Court for an Advisory Opinion would he the preferable course, if only for the reason that the opinion of the Court could he given after full argument in public, which would not he the case in the event of a reference to a committee of jurists* 10* At the same time Sir John Simon does not feel able to agree altogether with the contentions advanced in paragraph 5 of your letter. The opinion given, whether it emanated from the Permanent Court or from a committee of jurists, must he either in favour of or against the Persian claim to sovereignty over the islands; it would in effect he a decision on the legal question involved, and it is most unlikely that the Council would he disposed to take any other course than to adopt it. If the opinion were in favour of the Persian contention (which Sir John Simon can only regard as in the highest degree unlikely, at any rate if the opinion emanated from the Permanent Court), it does not seem probable that His Majesty’s Government would receive support from other Members of the Council in a refusal to accept it* It is true that if the Council were acting under Article 11, the unanimity rule would prevent the Council from adopting a report which His Majesty’s Government were not prepared to accept. It is also true that in the case of a report under Article 15 which was accepted by all the Members of/of the Council other than Hie Majesty's Government there *ould t»e no obligation on the other Members of the League to go to war in order to assist Persia to recover Bahtin. But if the effect of the report were that Persia was entitled to the islands in question, there would be * direct obligation on His Majesty's Government under Article 15(b) not to go to war with Persia if she 'complied with the recommendations of the 'report'. if therefore Persia were thereafter to endeavour to take physical possession of any of the islands, it would not (though this might depend to some extent on the terms of the report) be safe to assume that this would be regarded as an aggression which His Majesty's Government were entitled to resist by force, or that, in the event of hostilities ensuing, it would he Persia who would he regarded as having violated her obligations under the Pact of Paris or under Article 15(6) of the Covenant. But even if the possibility of hostilities can be ruled out, the resulting situation would be in the highest degree unsatisfactory. The position would be that there would have been a legal finding in favour of the Persian contention, with which His Majesty’s Government had refused to comply. While the provisions of Article 13(4) of the Covenant would not strictly be applicable (since an Advisory Opinion is not an award or decision) the attitude of Hiff Majesty’s Government would be wholly contrary to the policy which they have followed in regard to the League since its inception and would seriously prejudice their position as a Member of the Council in future when that body is endeavouring to compose disputes with which His Majesty’s Government are not concerned. Moreover, in view of the legal finding in favour of the Persian contention, the Persian Government would be entitled to act in all matters as though Bahrain belonged to them (which in some cases they do illegally.32 ? or at any rate extra-legally, today), and would be justified in international opinion in using any of the means which the extent of British interests and commitments might give them in order to establish their position. The resulting situation would be far worse than that which exists at present, and would seem likely to produce most undesirable results on British prestige in the Middle East# 11* But in any case Sir John Simon does not consider that it would he possible in practice to prevent the legal question being dealt with by either the Permanent Court or a committee of jurists, and he remains definitely of opinion that in the event of an appeal by Persia to the Council, the wisest, and indeed the only possible course for His Majesty’s Government is to face the situation boldly, not to raise any objection to the Council’s dealing with the matter, and to state their willingness that the legal question should be referred to the Permanent Court# It may be preferable that this should be done by means of a request by the Council for an Advisory Opinion rather than by a reference by special agreement between the parties, but this is not a point on which a decision need be taken at present# Sir John Simon ventures to think that once the Persian claim has received the publicity involved in its being brought before the Council, the object of His Majesty’s Government should be to ensure either that it is disposed of once for all# or that the responsibility for this not being done should rest entirely with the Persian Government# If the Persian Government agree to a reference to the Permanent Court, the opinion of the law Officers gives every reason for believing that the result will be to put an end to the Persian claim once and for all. If on the other hand the Persian Government refused a reference to the Court which His Majesty’s Government had accepted, Persia would have placed/pl.c. a „„. elr ^ tt . , TOng&gt; „ a lt , tght fiiriy aes _ j4 «h« Council would decline t„ duel Pun.hec . lth th . c„.. In thee. olrcumBtancee the »!„. to fsr , u „ ^ ^ ^ disappear, and His Majesty's Government would te in a far stronger position for dealing with Persian attempts at encroachment in the future. On the other hand any reluctance shown hy His Majesty's Government to a judicial examination of the case could scarcely fail to suggest that the Persian claim was not entirely devoid of merits, while a definite refusal would greatly increase the value of the claim to Persia, whether as an asset in treaty negotiations, or as a means of pursuing a policy of pin-pricks* 12. On the question of the international position of Bahrain, Sir John Simon agrees that, on the assumption that no change in the status of the island is contemplated, it may he well to make it plain that His Majesty’s Government have not acquired, and do not seek to acquire, hy usurpation or otherwise, jurisdiction over Bahrain as a British possession. But in his opinion, the fact of the Sheikh having entrusted his foreign relations to His Majesty’s Government is one of procedure only and not of substantive right. The Sheikh does not thereby acquire any greater right to independence from Persia than he had before. It merely means that a claim by Persia or any other state must he referred to, and settled with, His Majesty’s Government instead of with the Sheikh himself. Equally in taking over the foreign relations of Bahrain His Majesty’s Government have not acquired, and cannot acquire, any better right or title in the matter of the Persian claim than is possessed by the Sheikh himself. The position is that as His Majesty’s Government have the conduct of Bahrain’s foreign relations, they have the full international responsibility therefor, and they cannot plead the internal relationship/relationship between the Sheikh and themselve S as justifying any failure to comply with the international obligations relating to the territory. In other words, it is not possible for His Majesty f s Government on the one hand to prevent foreign states from dealing with the sheikh direct, and on the other to contend that His Majesty’s Government are not in a position to make the Sheikh give effect to his international obligations. 13. In view of the desirability of reaching an early decision on the important questions of policy involved, which may at any moment become urgent, I am to request that this letter may receive Sir Samuel Hoare’s consideration as soon as possible.

The Assembly authorises the Government to deliver to the Secretariat of the League of Nations its documents of ratification. (Here follows the text of Article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice). The acceptance by the Persian Government of the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice is contingent on reciprocity. It is valid for a period oi six years and thereafter until such time as notice may be given to terminate. This acceptance covers all disputes arising out of situations or facts directly or indirectly connected with the enforcement of such treaties and agreements as tne Persian Government may have accepted after ratiiication of the present declaration, other than:- (a) Disputes in rwgard to Persia’s territorial status (lit: 'matters') as also disputes in connection with the sovereignty of Persia over her islands and ports. (b)/(*) Disputes in regard to which the parties to the dispute have agreed or shall agree to have recourse to some other method of peaceful settlement; and (c) Disputes with regard to questions which according to International Law fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of Persia. The Imperial Persian Government further reserve for themselves the right to request the adjournment of the examination of any case in the Permanent Court of Justice when such case has been referred to the Council of the League of Nations. Permission for the adhesion of the Persian Government to article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice as cited in the above was sanctioned in the session of the 23rd Khurdad 1310 (June 14th 1931). The adhesion of the Persian Government is subject to the above-mentioned reservations, which are annexed to the authority in question. (Sd.) Chairman of the National Consultative Assembly. Dadgar.

Please see the P.O. letter of 30 August which sets out their views as to the line to he taken if Persia raises the questions of Bahrein, Tamb or Abu Musa at Geneva. Though Tehran telegram of 20 August, No.107 (flag A) suggested that Persia might be contemplating such a step, the later telegraphic correspondence enclosed with the P.O. letter indicate/ that there is no special reason to fear that she will do so. Nevertheless the P.O. have given us the fruits of their examination of the question and ask whether the S.of S. agrees with them. Please see also the d.o. letter of 23 August from Mr.Warner (flag B.) and the enclosed minute by Mr.Becket dealing with the international status of Bahrein. Without necessarily going nearly so far as Mr.Becket, we cannot, I fear, disclaim responsibility for dealing with I any international question that may arise about Bahrein. But if such question arose 0^ Geneva, we should be careful to explain the actual status of Bahrein and the extent of the independence of the Sheikh. This would also help us to explain v/hy we are unable to refer to arbitration or judicial settlement a dispute in which the existence of Bahrein as an independent state is challenged.

Department, LETTER 8 SEP ^54 Sir, I am directed by the S. of S. for I. to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 30 Aug. ? E 5438/139/34 relative to the possibility of the Persian Government raising the question of Persia’s claim to Bahrein, Ta ib and Abu Musa during the forthcoming sessions of the Council or the Assembly of the L. of R. 2. If the Persian delegate should assert these claims in the course of this year’s general discussion before the Assembly, Secretary Sir Saiduel Hoare agrees that it would be sufficient * for the U.K. Delegation to make a short counter-statement. Such counter statement should, in his opinion, be quite brief and summary, in order to avoid giving the Assembly“any impression that H.M.G. regard Persia’s claims as deserving of serious consideration. So far as the is concerned a reference to the correspondence would probably be sufficient. If the Persian claims to Tamb and Abp. Musa should also have been referred to, he suggests that it would suffice to state that while the history of these barren islands priorto 1750 is otsGure, since that date authority over them, and such effective occupation as has existed, has had its origin in the Jowasimi Arabs of the Trucial Coast of Arabia, that their representative ; the Sheikh of Shargah on that coast, | who exercises authority over ohese ruler islands^ is an independent/in special treaty relations with H.M.G. and that the Persian claim, which appears 1 to have first been put forward so recently as 1887, has been repudiated by H •M*Cr• acting on his behalf. 3 . If, however, Persia should seek to raise her claims before the Council under either Art. 11 or^15 of ,the Covenant Sir Samuel Hoare has Or**-* sdeie hesitation in accepting without qualification Sir John Simon’s view that there is no argument which could be advanced as a valid objection to the Council’s dealing with the merits of the case under tho 'Qiao nr f..no oi-hop of these articles. Ke would have doubted whether either article is strictly relevant, i-ersia’s claim to Baixrein for example, is in effect a refusal to recognise the status of Bahrein as an independent State in special treaty relations with H.M.G. The most relevant words in Art.11 are tho se/2800 5000 5 34 Draft Paper. r *~ x ?r , ^ ^ (rrA-^^ ^ / J'A ' 35i Department. those which declare it to he the friendly right of each Member of the League to bring to attention 'any circumstance whatever affecting international relations which threatens to disturb...the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends', while Art.15 relates to -te^y^disputes 'likely to lead to a rupture'. Sir Samuel Hoare suggests that it would be desirable for the British representative to point out that the independence of Bahrein is not a circumstance which in any way endangers peace, and that it is not likely to lead to a rupture unless Persia proposes to attack Bahrein, which H.M.G. presume is not her intention. He suggests that it would be desirable to make this point in order, from the commencement, to set the matter in its proper light before ftiembers of the Council, even though it might perhaps be wise to add that H.M.G., while doubting whether the articles of the Covenant are in any way applicable, nevertheless have no ' desire to prevent the Council being seized of the question on that account^ on the understanding that, whatever might be the result of the proceedings, H.M.G. consider that they will not be precluded/precluded thereby from resisting aggression by Persia if the latter should be so ill-advised as to £ embark upon such a nourse. 4 . As regards the position which would arise if, as may be anticipated, the Council suggested a reference to the Permanent Court of International Justice, oir Samuel Hoare has the following observations to offer to Sir John Simon 1 s view that, it would be preferable to accept such | a reference rather than alio?/ the Council to arrive at its conclusion | on the advice merely of its ovm committee of legal' experts, lie would be prepared to accept Sir John Simon’s; reasoning on this choice of alternatives if the case were one in which K.k.J. could afford to run the risk, ho?vever small, of an adverse; decision b, the International Court. But in the present case it is necessaPy to envisage the consequences which would follow if the totally unexpected happened and the Court gave a decision in Persia 1 s favour. In that event Sir Samuel Iloare cannot see that H.M.C. would have any alternative but to refuse to implement the decision, | having regard alike to their strategic and other interests, their obligations of honour and justice to the Sheikh and finally their own reputation for faith and loyalty throughout the middle Easi. He/ %*•&lt;***4 2800 5000 5 34 effect/ Draft Paper. He would therefore suggest that before it is decided to agree to a reference of the Bahrein case to the Permanent Court a preliminary decision is first required on the question whether, in the conceivable event of an adverse decision, H.M.G. are prepared to depart so far from their policy of cooperation with the League as to decline absolutely to implement a decision by the Court. He would be glad to receive an expression of Sir John Simon’s views on this point, 5. If, on the other hand, the Council dealt with the matter after reference to its own expert committee and made an adverse or inconclusive report, though the risk of this appears to be regarded as slightly less remote than that of a wrong decision by the Court, Sir Samuel Hoare suggests that the evil consequences would be far more tolerable. In the first place it seems probable that an adverse report by the Council would not be unanimous, but that at least some members other than the parties to the dispute would lend their support throughout to H.M.G. In this event it does not appear that any gra.ve consequences would ensue, since under para. 7 of Art.15 the 351 Department.* effect of a non- unanimous report is merely that members of the League retain their freedom of action. Even on the gravest and least probable hypothesis of ^unanimous report in Persia’s favour the only effect appears to be that under para.6 of Art.15 no member of the League would go to war with Persia in order to assist H.M.G. in resisting possible Persian aggression. But if Persia were so foolish as to * resort to war, presumably there could I be no question of this country’s own right to resist aggression^especially if the caveat suggested at the end of para.3 above had been entered at the outset. There remains the hypothesis suggested in para. 9 of your letter thait in an attempt to spare Persian susceptibilities the Council might frame its report in such terms as would not finally dispose of Persia’s claim. The result of this, however, would be the continuance of the status quo and H.M.G. would not be in an appreciably worse position than that which obtains at the present. 6. On this comparison of the possible results of an adverse decision by the Court of International Justice andean adverse or inconclusive report by the Council,Sir Samuel Hoare feels, having regard to what is at stakeu^on each event, that it is preferable to run a slightly greater risk of the far lesser evil 7 /Draft Paper. Department. '3* 1 7 * If p ersia , s claim is taken up by the Council, it 'would certainly seem desirable to wait for Persia to develop her case before finally deciding on the exact line to be taken in reply. Sir Samuel Hoare considers, however, that, for the reasons suggested above, it would in any event be preferable to decline a reference to the International Court, and he also suggests that, with a view partly to explaining to fhe members of the I Council the reasons of H.M.G ! s attitude, it would be highly desirable that the British representative, at the commencement of his counter-statement before the Council, should give an i adequate account of the actual status j of Bahrein and of the reasons why | H.M.G. is a party to the dispute. 8. In making this last suggestion Sir Samuel Hoare has had the advantage of reading Mr. Beckett*s minute of 15 Aug. 34, enclosed with the d.o. letter from the P.0, of 23 Aug., E 5277/2369/91, which suggests that Bahrein is really under the sovereignty of H.M.G. from the point of view of international law. Whatever may be i/y* fan if m** the preci-se -e-fatuo of Ba-hre-fn in , ^ ^ l(UJ international theory, Sir Samuel Hoare agrees that the international responsibility/ 2800 5000 5 341% responsibility of in respect of Bahrein is a practical and necessary consequence of the fact tha by treaty with the Sheikh they are in exclusive control of his external relations. But it is also an important fact that Bahrein is not a British possession and that the Sheikb is an independent potentate in the sense that he exercises sovereignty in his internal affairs. It is necessary to bear this aspect of the case in mind as well as the international responsibility of and Sir Samuel Hoare suggests that it| would be particularly desirable to ^raw atteirtroe^o these facts in any argument before a political body such as the Council of,the League of Nations, some of whose members might otherwise be so ill-informed as to suppose that H.M.G. may have acquired, or may seek to acquire, by usurpation or otherwise, jurisdiction over Bahrein as a British possession. 9. The S.of S. accordingly suggests that if the Council of the League take Persia’s claim to Bahrein; into consideration, the statement of the British case should give prominenbe to the following points:- (a) that Bahrein is not a British possession but an independent State in special treaty relations with H.M.G., and that the latter make no sort of claim to internal sovereignty; (b)/Draft Paper.

If, however, the matter has to be further considered, it is clear that it will not be practicable to give final instructions to the British representatives at the forthcoming meetings of the Council of the League. It is observed that Tehran telegram Ho.114 of 25 Aug. indicates no special reason for supposing that the Persian Government intend^ to bring up frieJr claims at those meetings. If, however, they should place them on the agenda before a decision has been reached as to the line to be adopted by H.M.G.. Sir Samuel Hoare suggests that the British representative on the Council should be instructed to secure a postponement/Position of Tamti and Al)u MUsa» This is the first occasion on which we have had any suggestion that Tanih and Ahu Musa were likely to he taken to the League of Nations. The history ana status of Tamh and Ahu Musa are identical. The question is examined in considerable detail in the memorandum on Tamh and Ahu Musa on pages 97-104 of P.G. 13. No Persian claim has been formally admitted at any stage in the case of either island. While the history 0 :f both is obscure prior to 1750, such authority and sucn effective occupation as there has been since that date has had its source in the Jowasimi Arabs, who have not been Persian subjects and whose headquarters are on the Arab shore. The Persian claim appears first to have been putforward so recently as 1887, and while it has frequently since been repeated it has at no stage been accepted by H.M.G. 3* / L#4r&lt;^ iK/tir fLuwvX ^ Ct*/ UcXUtcAcvy i±: &lt;&gt;vv ^ ^ ^ 4 ^ oarvu*£» ch b (Xcua* ^o^Ck U-iAA. aK(^Z\_ rWw &lt;aaa _ 4 .Minute Paper.

'“ ' Para. 4 of the 7.0. lett er. - Any counter- statement should be quite brief and summary, in order to avoid giving the Assembly the impression that we regard the Persian claim as one deserving of serious consideration. As regards Bahrein, a reference to the published correspondence would probably be sufficient. A further short statement of facts regarding the status of Tamb and Abu Musa ought to be sufficient for the British delegates, in case these are referred to. End of para. 5.- Surely we could, and should, say that the independence of Bahrein is not a circumstance 'affecting international relations which threatens to ; disturb international peace or the good understanding (Art.15) that the fact that the independence of Bahrein is disputed by Persia is not 'likely to lead to a rupture' unless Persia proposes to attack Bahrein, which we presume is not her intention. It seems desirable to make this point at the outset, in order to put the matter into its right focus, even though (as perhaps would be wise) we went on to say that we had no desire on that account to prevent the Council being seized of the question. Paras. 8- 11.- The E.O. reasoning would be sound if we were dealing with a case in which we could afford to run the risk (however small) of an adverse decision by the International Court. But in the present case we have to consider the consequences if the almost impossible happened/2 . happened, and the Court gave a decision in Persia’s iav'uar. We should then have no course but to refuse to implement it - both on account of ouf own strategic and other interests, and in justice to the Sheihh and in order to avoid the absolute destruction of our prestige and reputation for loyalty to our friends in the Gulf and throughout the Middle East. Are the F.O. prepared to face this consequence of a conceivably adverse decision by the Court - viz. , that in order to avoid the greater evils referred to above, we should have to break away from our League policy to the extent of declining absolutely to implement a decision given by the Court of International Justice ? I should think that the risk of the Court giving a wrong decision may very likely be almost negligible, but, having regard t o what is at stake, are we prepared to run even a negligible risk ? On the other hand, if the Council deals witn the matter with the assistance of its own expert Committee, and makes a report, this has no material consequence unlessjs the report is unanimous. Very probably some members of the Council, not parties to the dispute, would dissent from a report adverse to H.M.G. Even if the report is unanimous, it seems to have little practical eilect (see the sixth para* of Art.15). The worst that the F.O. suggest is that the Council might make an inconclusive report. But this would not make our position materially worse than it is at present. If, therefore, the dispute is brought by Persia before the Council, it seems desirable that, as soon as Persia has developed her case, we should make it clear that we are not prepared to refer it to the International Court - not because we have any doubt of the Bahrein case, I but because the Sheikh of Bahrein naturally objects to the submission to international arbitration of a dispute which involves the very existence of the Bahrein State, and/f Minute Paper. Department. and because it would be an abure of our position as his trustee to submit it against his wishes. Par a.I S of t he F.0.1e t t er.- Unless the F.O. and 1.0. are able to agree at once as to the way of handling the case, it will obviously ta.ke time for H.M.G. to arrive at a decision as to what line should be taken in the event of Persia bringing the dispute before the Council. If, therefore, Persia, contrary to expectation, should bring it before the Council in the near future, the British representatives should secure a postponement, pointing out that there is obviously no urgency.

CONFIDENTIAL Sir, Jlf V With reference to Foreign Office letter -'o.L 5353/139/34 oi the 24th August, enclosing a copy of a telegram from His Majesty ! s Minister at Tehran regarding the possibility that the Persian Government may raise the question of the Persian claims to Bahrain, Tamb and Abu Musa during the forthcoming sessions of the Council or Assembly of the League of Nations, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you for the information of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare the accompanying copies of telegraphic correspondence with Sir Reginald Hoare. 2. It appears from Sir Reginald Hoare’s telegram of the 25th August that there is now somewhat less ground for- expecting that the matter will be raised at Geneva next month. Sir John Simon had, however, before its receipt caused an examination to be made or the various ways in which the Persian claims could be raised before the Council or Assembly of the League and the courses which it would be open to His Majesty’s Government ro pursue in each case. He still considers it desirable to bring the results of this examination to the notice of Sir Samuel Hoare and to learn his views thereon. 3. Sir John Simon is advised that there are three recognised methods by which the Persian Representative could bring the claims in question before the Council or Assembly at ENCLOSURE IH LETTER I ^eir/ Nc. 3 7 13 SEP 1934 FPiOJ , . AMD The Under-Secretary of State, e I CART DEPT, INDIA OFFICE ——“1 r-r I W 1 . India Office. COPi s Tutheir forthcoming sessions. He might, in his speech during tue general discussion, which takes place at the heginning or each Assembly, assert the pretentions of his Government in general terms. (if the matter were raised in this manner, no question would arise of any action being taken by any organ of the League). Alternatively, he might bring the question be fore ti.e Council un der Article 11 of the League Covenant. Or, again, he might bring it before them under Article 15. (ihe texus oi these articles are annexed hereto for convenience of reference). In the case of such an appeal under the provisions of the Covenant, the following points of procedure are relevant. Normally three weeks* notice is required for the insertion of an item in the provisional agenda of the Council, and the provisional agenda for the next session of the Council, which opens on the 7th September, have already been circulated. In cases of urgency, however, the Council has in practice the power to add further items to its agenda at short notice. There will also be a session of the new Council, which will be constituted at the session of the Assembly^ on or about the 20th September, and in the case of this later session the normal three weeks’ notice is not required. 4. The first of the three contingencies enumerated above is evidently the least serious, and, in Sir John Simon’s view, it would only be necessary for the United Kingdom Delegation to make a brief counter-statement, combining a reference to the views of His Majesty’s Government on the subject of the Persian claim to Bahrain, as already set forth in documents circulated to the members of the League, with a short outline of the case for regarding the Persian claims to Tamb and Abu Musa to be at least equally unsound on generally similar/oimilar g± oundo. it appears to Sir John Simon that it would undoubtedly be desirable, in order to avoid the deleterious effects of a period of uncertainty as to the reply oi His Ivlajesty’s Government that the United Kingdom Delegation should be in a position to reply immediately on these lines, since if any answer was to be made, this could only be done during the course of the general discussion with which the Assembly opens. With this end in view he would propose to provide the Delegation with the necessary material xor such a statement in advance and suggests that his Department should collaborate with the India Office on its preparation forthwith. b. With regard to the second and third contingencies envisaged above, namely a definite appeal by Persia for the assistance of the League under either Article 11 or Article 15 of the Covenant, it has been suggested in the course of past interdepartmental discussions that further proceedings at Geneva might be arrested at the outset by the preliminary objection that, in view of the evident absurdity of the Persian claims, the matter is not one which could properly be raised under these or any other articles of the Covenant and the Council should, therefore, not proceed to consider the merits of the question. This course, bir John Simon is advised, is not practicable for the following reasons. The general lines of the Persian thesis would doubtless be that Persia claimed sovereignty over the islands in question; that she wished to establish administrative control there; and that she was prevented from doing so by the attitude of His Majesty’s Government. A claim such as this by one power for the restitution to it of territory, which it is prevented from administering/administering 'by the action of another ? is eminently one of those -which may he properly submitted to the Council under Articles 11 or 15. It would he manifestly impossible to contend that claims of this class did not come within the scope of these articles of the Covenant. It is true that His Majesty’s Government maintain that in this particular case the Persian claim is without legal foundation; hut, as the Council clearly cannot accept the ex parte assertion to this effect of one of the parties to the dispute, the Council would necessarily have to go into the merits of the Persian claim in order to reject it on this ground. This argument, therefore, cannot he advanced as a preliminary objection to the Council dealing with the matter at all, since it is only an answer to the Persian claim on the merits. Sir John Simon does not think, therefore, that there is any argument which His Majesty’s Government could successfully advance before the Council as a valid objection to the Council’s dealing with the merits of the case under Articles 11 and 15. 6. The Council would, then, be obliged, regardless of the attitude adopted by His Majesty’s Government, to deal with the dispute if the matter were referred to it under Articles 11 or 15 of the Covenant, and a refusal on the part of His Majesty’s Government to co-operate, by furnishing the Council with all the evidence available in support of their case, could only react unfavourably on their own interests. 7. In the case of disputes brought under Article 15, the procedure is for the Council to call on both parties, in the first instance, for statements of their respective cases. It then endeavours to settle the dispute by conciliation; and if this proves impossible, it issues a report/361 report giving its owi opinion as to the position and stating ’..hat should he done. In the present case conciliation would clearly he impossible, and the Council would at an early stage find itself faced with a simple question of law: is the Persian claim to sovereignty over these islands sound or is it not? The Council is in general loth to give a ruling on purely legal questions, and having explored without success the possibilities of conciliation, it would in all probability seek the consent of the two parties to the reference of the dispute to the Permanent Court of International Justice of The Hague. Hailing such consent, the Council would appoint its own committee of jurists to advise it and, on the strength of their advice, would issue a report containing recommendations as to the settlement of the dispute. 8. It will he observed from the foregoing exposition that no action or inaction on the part of His Majesty’s Government could prevent the Persian claim being considered either by the Permanent Court of International Justice or by the Council of the League. A reference of the question to the Hague Court could, on the other hand, he prevented by either party to the dispute, and it is therefore relevant to consider which of these alternatives would he preferable from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government. sir John Simon is strongly of the opinion that a reference to the Hague Court would he the more advantageous course from the point o^ view of His Majesty’s Government. The dispute is a clean-cut legal issue and the Law Officers of the Crown have recently advised that Persia lias no right in or over Pahrain. Except, therefore, in the most unlikely event of the Persian Government being able to establish further relevant facts which Y&gt;/ere not placed before the La?/ Officers when the case was referred to them. Sir John Simon has no doubt whatever tha t, /S2 that, if the case came -before the Permanent Court, judgment would he given against Persia. A consideration of the personnel of the Permanent Court and a careful study of the judgments given hy the Court up to date afford no ground whatever for the view that there is any possibility of the Permanent Court deciaing wrongly a legal question where there is no reasonable doubt as to what is the right conclusion from a legal point of view* It is perfectly true that many of the past judgments of the Court have been ’given by narrow majorities, and it is equally true that in one or two of these cases there are lawyers who are of the opinion that the majority of the Court has come to the wrong conclusion; but these were cases where the legal question submitted to the Court was admittedly a doubtful one on which lawyers might be expected to differ* It may be that, in circumstances where the legal arguments on either side appear to be equally cogent, an individual judge’s conclusions may be influenced by his own personal prejudices or sympathies; but there seems no ground whatever for supposing it to be possible that the Permanent Court would decide a clear legal issue wrongly through personal and national prejudice. Further, even if it were to be supposed that the Permanent Court was strongly influenced by extra-legal considerations (a hypothesis which is not thought to be true), it is difficult to conceive of any reasons why, in a dispute between His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government as regards sovereignty over islands in the Persian Gulf, the prejudices of the majority of the Court should be in favour of Persia rather than of His Majesty’s Government. Indeed, it would appear to be natural that the contrary should be the case, seeing tha t/that the support and confidence ofHis Majesty's Government is absolutely essential to the Court if it is to maintain its present high position. The views of Persia are relatively unimportant from this point of view. 9 0 If, on the other hand, the Council were obliged to give an opinion based on the findings of a legal committee set up under its auspices, while there is little if any reason to doubt that in so clear a case the legal point would be decided in accordance with its merits, it is possible that in an attempt to spare Persian susceptibilities, the Council might frame their report in such terms as would not dispose of the Persian claim in so final and definite a imanner. Sir John Simon does not wish to suggest that this would necessarily, or even probably, be the result; for the Council has been known on occasion to give an entirely clear-cut decision, as for example in the dispute between Colombia and Peru on the point relating to the sovereignty over the Letitia trapezium* He considers, however, that in the circumstances envisaged, there would be definite advantage in the reference of the Persian claims to the Permanent Court of International Justice, 10. This conclusion of course depends upon the hypothesis, which w/ould appear to be a reasonably safe one, that the Persian Government cannot establish a series of facts relevant to their claim over Bahrain, which are at present unknown to His Majesty's Government and which might warrant a less confident view of the strength of their legal case. If Sir Samuel Hoare conceives this to be a danger, it could be avoided if His Majesty's Government allowed the Persian Government fully to develop their case before the Council before/) 364 'before they armounced their readiness for the matter to he decided hy the Permanent Court. if, when Persia developed her case, the facts upon which she relied appeared to he substantially di-iierent i.rom those at present known to His Majesty’s Government, the decision as to the line to he taken hy His Majesty’s Government could he reconsidered; hut, in the event of the Persian expose not adducing any such new facts, then Sir John Simon considers that it would he the wisest policy for His Majesty’s Government at the commencement of their reply to indicate His Majesty’s Government’s willingness to have recourse to the Permanent Court. The foregoing paragraphs deal with the situation which would arise if the Persian appeal were made under Article 15 of the Covenant. If the matter were raised under article 11, it is prohahle that the procedure followed would, in the first stages, he the same, the Council endeavouring to obtain the agreement of the parties to a reference of the dispute to the Hague Court, and, if that proved impossible, seeking the advice of a special committee of jurists. The essential difference between the two contingencies lies in the fact that under Article 11 the Council has powers of conciliation only. Its report would not, therefore, have the same force as one issued under Article 15. It is, however, to he anticipated that the endeavours of the Council to bring about a settlement would result in dragging out the proceedings over a long period and, if only for this reason, it can hardly he doubted that a reference to the Hague Court would he preferable from the point of view of His Majesty's Government. 12 ./38b 12 ° sir Jolin Simon is impressed v/ith the desirability 0 ! securing, so .Lar as possible, that it the Persian Government do in fact raise the question of the Persian claims to Bahrain, Tamb and Abu Musa before the Council or Assembly of the League, the matter should be disposed of with as little delay as possible. Clearly, once the matter has been raised, the longer the result is in doubt, the more harmful will be the impression among the Arabs of the Persian Gulf. it appears to him, therefore, that it would be prudent, not only to arrange, as suggested in paragraph 4 above, that the United Kingdom delegation should be prepared with an immediate reply for use if the Persian delegation raise the matter before the Assembly, but also to take a decision in principle as to the general line which His Majesty’s Government should adopt, if the Persian claims were to be raised by way of an appeal to the Council under Articles 11 or 15 of the Covenant. Sir John Simon will therefore be glad to know whether Sir Samuel Hoare agrees in the views expressed upon this latter point in paragraphs 8-11 of this letter. I am.

S.W.l, 23rd August, 1934. My dear Laithwaite, I send you herewith, for your confidential information, a copy of an interesting minute hy Beckett about the legal side of the Bahrain case. 2. His views, as I think you will agree, have an important hearing on the question of the formula which should he employed to describe, in public pronouncements, the status of the Sheikh and that of the other Arab Rulers in the Persian Gulf. Hitherto, as you know, we have always been careful to emphasize the independence of these Rulers, while mentioning the fact that they ara in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government; and in the Anglo-Persian draft general treaty we have been J.G. Laithwaite, Esq. prepared to put ourselves on a par with Persia in recognising the Sheikh of Bahrain's 'independence and 'sovereign rights'. But while we have thought it useful. ENCLOSURE 1H LITTER NO. 3 7 13 SEP 1934 PRGFi/i BEORETAPu, A ‘ ]D SECRET DEPT. iNDiA QFnQE . QPPY SENT TO on/on many occasions to efface ourselves, in dealing with other Governments, behind the independence of the Sheikh, the desirability of declaring a protectorate over both Bahrain and Koweit has more than once been broached, 3. We have gone into this point further with Beckett on the basis of his minute, and his view is that the phrase H an independent Sheikhdom in special 'treaty relations with His Majesty's Government' does not really even suggest a completely normal independent state, but rather something closely akin to a protectorate. The hitherto accepted formula is, therefore, sufficiently accurate in his opinion. He considers, however, that we should be careful to avoid speaking of the independence of Bahrain without at the same time referring to the special treaty relations, and should in particular avoid anything which might be held to misrepresent the legal position in cases where the international aspect is important.4. As regards the general treaty, Beckett thinks that it would he preferable that there should be a reference to the special treaty relations between His Majesty^ Government and the Sheikh of Bahrain in close connexion with the passage in which we associate ourselves with Persia in recognizing his independence. It may be, therefore, that the draft would require alteration in this respect, for, as you know, the two relevant passages are at present separated by the bulk of the treaty. But this, though a point to be borne in mind, is of no immediate importance. 5. Beckett has pointed out that it is an accepted international principle - to which inter alia His Majesty’s Government have expressly subscribed (vide League of Nations. Codification of International law, volume C.75.M.69. 1929 V. pages 122 and 124) that the conduct of foreign relations of another entity entails full international responsibility for what happens there.6, It might, I think, he useful to have a talk about the matter some time. lAf*COPY (E 5277/2369/91) Eastern Department. I have now read through carefully the complete dossier of papers sent to the Law Officers with regard to Bahrein and the Law Officers* Opinion. Having read the whole case, I am not surprised that the Law Officers stated that there was no foundation whatever for a Persian claim to sovereignty over the Islands and I do not think there can toe any possitole doubt on the matter. I have recently toeen studying an arbitral award given toy a former President of the Permanent Court of International Justice, Mr, Huber, between the United States and the Netherlands and relating to sovereignty over a certain Island in the China Seas. Prom two points of view this award is extremely useful in connexion with the Bahrein case, and I think it is as well to call attention to it in this connexion in case the matter has in the future to be argued further. In the P almas Island case the Netherlands who won the case based their claim on the fact that they had in fact been exercising sovereignty over Palmas Island for a number of years; the Arbitrator decided in the Netherlands* favour and his whole award is based upon the recognition of the actual exercise of sovereignty as creating prescriptive rights which override a previous title. Secondly the method in which Lhe Netherlands in fact exercised sovereignty was by reason of treaties # rn » 4L J A entered/entered into by the native ruler, which they regarded as establishing suzerainty. Under the Netherlands treaties the native ruler retained his independence with regard to the administration of all native affairs on tne Island but the Netherlands Government controlled his foreign relations and also exercised jurisdiction over foreigners. 'Ihe two cases have, therefore, considerable analogies. The Arbitrator discusses what is the actual position in international law which is created by such treaties with native rulers. His answer shortly is that in these cases the essentials of sovereignty are made up by the addition of the functions possessed by the Netherlands to those still left to the native ruler; add the two together and you get all that is required to make complete sovereignty, and the Netherlands were entitled to include the functions left to their vassal as part of the necessary elements of their own sovereignty. This is what Mr. Huber says in his own words:- 'As regards contracts between a State and native princes or chiefs not recognized as members of the community of nations, these are not in the international law sense treaties or conventions capable of creating rights and obligations such as may, in international law, arise out of treaties* But on the other hand, contracts of this nature are not wholly void of indirect effects on situations governed by international law; if they do not constitute titles in international law, they are none the less facts of which that law must in certain circumstances/circumstances take account. From the time of the discoveries until recent times colonial territory has very often been acquired, especially in the East Indies, by means of contracts with the native authorities, which contracts leave the existing organisations more or less intact as regards the native population, while granting to the Colonizing Power, besides economic advantages, also the exclusive direction of relations with other powers and the right to exercise public authority in regard to their own nationals and to foreigners. The form of the legal relations created by such contracts Is most generally that of suzerainty and vassal or of the so-called colonial protectorate. In substance, it is not an agreement between equals; It is rather a form of international organisation of a colonial territory, on the basis of autonomy for the natives. In order to regularize the situation as regards other States, this organization requires to be completed by the establishment of powers to ensure the fulfilment of the obligations imposed by international law on every State withregard to its own territory. And thus suzerainty over the native State becomes the basis of territorial sovereignty as towards other members of the community of nations. It is the sum total of functions thus allotted either to the native authorities or to those of the colonial power which decides the question whether at/at any given period the conditions required for the exercise of sovereignty are fulfilled.” Xt seems to me that what Mr# Huber says applies to Bahrein# Xhe elements necessary ior the constitution of sovereignty in regard to Bahrein are at the present day made up of the addition of (a) H.M.G^s right under the exclusive treaties in force since 1880, viz. control of foreign relations and jurisdiction over foreigners, and (b) the government of the native affairs of the territory still left with the Sheik. Bahrein is a State under British protection and is really under the sovereignty of H.M*G. from the point of view of international law# The only criticism which occurs to me of the very admirable way in which our case has been presented in the past and of the arguments in the material laid before the Law Officers is that much too much stress has been laid upon the n independence” of the Sheik of Bahrein. Up to 1880 this was correct; after that it is not really legally correct to state that the Sheik is independent. A ruler who has no control of his external relations is not fully independent under international law# We have rightly stressed the complete absence of effective Persian sovereignty during all the relevant periods, but I do not think we have made quite enough of the evidence of effective exercise of sovereignty by H.M.G., which is really equally striking; such as the deposition of unsatisfactory Sheiks, the control exercised over them by political residents, and the fact that it is H.M*G# who have resisted the claims not merely of Persia hut of Turkey and Muscat and the Wahabis. The second point is that Persia has based her case on the alleged doctrine that a State cannot lose sovereigntyover part of its territory unless it cedes it by a f treaty or recognises the independence of a new State, The Persian case denies the doctrine of prescription, Mr. Huber*s award, as I have stated above, is based upon the recognition of this doctrine, and he clearly states that effective display of sovereignty for a number of years in independence of a State formerly possessing title creates a new title to sovereignty and causes the previous one to lapse. Here is a quotation of what Mr. Huber says about prescription as a ground for the acquisition of a new sovereignty. It is extremely to the point. ,f Practice, as well as doctrine, recognizes though under different legal formulae and with certain differences as to the conditions required - that the continuous and peaceful display of territorial sovereignty (peaceful in relation to other States) Is as good as a title **Territorial sovereignty, as has already been said, involves the exclusive right to display the activities of a State. This right has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular their right to integrity and inviolability In peace and in war, together with the rights which each State may claim for its nationals In foreign territory. Without manifesting its territorial sovereignty in a manner corresponding to circumstances, the State cannot fulfil this duty. Territorial sovereignty/sovereignty cannot limit itself to its negative side, i.e. to excluding the activities of other States; for it serves to divide between nations the space upon which human activities are employed, in order to assure them at all points the minimum of protection of wnich international law is the guardian* u Although municipal law, thanks to its Judicial system, is able to recognize abstract rights or property as existing apart from any material display of them, it has none the less limited x-heir effect by the principles of prescription and the protection of possession# International law, the structure of which is not based on any super-State organisation, cannot be presumed to reduce a right such as territorial sovereignty, with which almost all international relations are bound up, to the category of an abstract right, without concrete manifestations. ’’The principle that continuous and peaceful display of the functions of State within a given region is a constituent element of territorial sovereignty is not only based on the conditions of the formation of independent States and their boundaries (as shown by the experience of political history) as well as on an international jurisprudence and doctrine widely accepted; this principle has further been recognized in more than one federal State, where a jurisdictiont’ is established in order to apply, as need arises, rules of international law to the interstate relations of the States members. This is the more significant, in that it might well be conceived that in a federal State possessing a complete judicial system for interstate matters - far more than in the domain of international relations properly so-called - there should be applied to territorial questions the principle that, failing any specific provision of law to the contrary, a .lus in re once lawfully acquired shall prevail over de facto possession however well established. 'It may suffice to quote among several non-dissimilar decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States of America that in the case of the State of Indiana v. State of Kentucky (136 U.S. 479) 1890, where the precedent of the case of Rhode Island v. Massachusetts (4. How. 591, 639) is supported by quotations from VATTEL and WHEATON, who both admit prescription founded on length of time as a valid and incontestable title.' (Signed) W.E.

Foreign Office, July 2% l&amp;dl. ^ le lonour ’ by direction of Secretary Sir John Simon, to transmit Bahrein: to you the papers noted m the accompanying list, and to request the favour Persia’s of your opinion on the subject of the rights claimed by Persia in the Archipelago rights of of Bahrein. r « nvA - fb Bahrein is a small archipelago lying on the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf and almost land-locked by the Arabian province of Hasa in the dominions of Ibn Saud, the ruler of Saudi Arabia, and by the Peninsula of Qatar which is- the territory of the independent Arab Sheikh of Qatar. The population of Bahrein is essentially Arab by race, though since the beginning of the present century there has been a considerable influx of Persian nationals. 3. Ihe archipelago is of considerable commercial importance. The pearl banks by which it is surrounded make it the centre of a pearl trade which, in good years, is of very considerable dimensions, while oil has recently been discovered there. Its strategic position in the centre of the Persian Gulf, always important, has become still more so of late years with the development of the aii route to India and the possibility that it may be desirable to use the island as a British naval station. 4. A historical memorandum prepared by the India Office, and dealing in detail with the history of Bahrein both before and after 1783 is attached (Paper A). It is conceived that the answers to the question as to which your advice is desired will depend almost entirely on the view taken of the historical facts there set out, and it has therefore been thought necessary to state those facts in detail. The situation may, however, be summarised as follows :— 5. The sheikhdom was for some time prior to 1783 under Persian rule. The Persians were in that year driven out of the islands by Arabs from the mainland of Arabia under the leadership of the direct ancestor of the present ruling house, in whom sovereignty has rested since that date. Claims to sovereignty, or possibly in some cases suzerainty, over Bahrein have repeatedly been preferred by Persia since 1783. They were also preferred by Turkey (suzerain up to the war of the adjoining mainland) with great insistence on a number of occasions between 1847 and 1913, in which latter year the Turkish Government finally recognised the independence of the island; and they have been put forward in the past by Muscat; by Egypt; and by the Wahabi Amirs of the Arab mainland. Tribute was last certainly paid to Persia in 1799. It has at one time or other between 1800 and 1870 been paid also to Muscat, to Egypt, and to the Wahabi Amirs, although in the case of the last-named, at any rate in the more recent period, possibly only in respect of possessions on the mainland of Arabia. Bahrein, at least since 1820, has consistently been regarded as independent by His Majesty’s Government, who have been in special treaty relations with its rulers on that basis since that date. Those treaty relations (which have throughout involved contingent liabilities for protection) were strengthened in 1861, while by engagements contracted in 1880 and 1892 the ruling house have undertaken obligations which place their external relations in the hands of His Majesty’s Government and preclude them from ceding territory save to, or with the consent of, His Majesty’s Government. 6. In 1927, 1928 and 1929 important notes were exchanged between His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government in regard to the latter’s claim to Bahrein, of which copies have been communicated to the Secretary- General of the League of Nations for communication to the States Members of 7525 [10356—1]2 PERSIA the League.

His Majesty’s Government, however, are anxious, to enable them to consider how best to deal with any further assertion of the Persian claim, for the advice of the Law Officers as to whether I ersia possesses an\ the p ers i an claim has been asserted with great insistence over a very long period of years, the grounds adduced in support ol it have varied from time to time and have never been stated by the Persian Government m any very areat detail The fullest expression of the Persian attitude is that contained in the notes of the 26th November. 1927. and the 2nd August, 1928. The various arguments which, from time to time, Persia has advanced m support of her claim a pa n s follows : — (1) The history of the islands prior to 1783. Persia contends that an appeal to history shows that prior to this date the islands were trom a remote period subject, and tributary, to her. (2) The absence of Persian consent to the detachment of Bahrein, admittedly at one stage prior to 1783 a Persian possession, from Persia; and the fact that Persia has never recognised the islands as independent and has consistently urged a claim to them, (3) Certain provisions of the treaty (unratified and disavowed by both parties) concluded between Captain Bruce. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the Minister of the Prince Governor of Shiraz, in 1892. (4) A gold coin alleged to have been struck at Bahrein in 1817. (5) Payment by Bahrein at various stages of peeshkesh,” offerings, or tribute to Persia. (6) Plying of the Persian flag by the Sheikh of Bahrein. (7) Letters from past rulers of Bahrein admitting Persian suzerainty. (8) A note addressed by His Majesty’s Government in April 1869 to the Persian Minister in London. (9) Closeness of relations at the present day between Persia and Bahrein. 9. The arguments referred to in the preceding paragraph are briefly examined in paragraphs 147-152 of the historical memorandum (Paper A) attached, which suggests the conclusion that they afford no solid basis for a Persian claim to sovereignty or suzerainty over the Island of Bahrein. 10. Apart from the arguments based on historical events, the only important legal consideration wffiich has been advanced by the Persian Government m support of their claim is that contained in paragraph 2 of the note addressed by the Acting Persian Minister for Foreign xlffairs to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran on the 2nd August, 1928 (p. 4, Paper B). Nou will observe that a detailed reply to this argument was made in paragraphs 5-8 of the note addressed by Sir Austen Chamberlain to the Persian Minister in London on the 18th February, 1929 (pp. 8 and 9, Paper B). Reference may also be made in this connexion to the article entitled “ Sovereignty, Seisin and the League : by Sir John Fischer Williams {British Yearbook.of International Law, 1926, p. 24).PERSIA 3 11. I have accordingly the honour to request you to take the enclosed papers into your consideration, and to advise, in the light of the facts stated in the historical memorandum (Paper A), the various arguments which have been employed on either side in the course of the discussion of this question, and of any other considerations which may appear to you to be relevant, whether, in your opinion, Persia possesses any rights in or over Bahrein, and if so what the nature of those rights is. 12. The question of the future policy of His Majesty’s Government in regard to Persia, as to which the Ministerial Middle East Sub-Committee may have to take important decisions at any moment, may be to a considerable extent dependent upon the nature of your opinion on the above point, and Sir John Simon would therefore be grateful if it were possible for you 'to furnish your opinion at a very early date.

Report. The Persian claim to sovereignty over Bahrein appears to be based upon the view that from time immemorial the islands were Persian territory, and that by virtue of the fact that Persia has never expressly recognised their independence, coupled with various assertions of sovereign right on the part of Persia, and of admissions from time to time of the Persian claims on the part of the rulers of Bahrein and of His Majesty’s Government, Persian sovereignty has never been lost. The facts as narrated in the historical memorandum prepared by the India Office do not, in our opinion, support this view. There is no satisfactory evidence of any kind that at any date before 1783 Bahrein was incorporated in Persian territory. The most that can be said is that there was a period of Persian occupation at the beginning of the 17th century, and that for a short period in the 18th century a de facto control was exercised by a Persian Governor. Whether this control ever acquired the character of de jure sovereignty may be doubted, but, in our opinion, the expulsion of the Persian garrison in 1783 never to return makes it impossible to rely upon what had happened before that event. The later history of Persian claims to sovereignty over the islands affords no evidence of any recognition either by His Majesty’s Government or by any other sovereign power of Bahrein as Persian soil. The Bruce Treaty of 1822 cannot be relied on, while the three treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 appear to us to be wholly silent as to Persian rights over Bahrein. The British note of 1869 is the high-water mark of any admission of Persian rights. Even this note, however, falls far short of a recognition of sovereignty, and nothing said or done thereafter gives any support to Persian claims.4 PERSIA / Even if Persia were able as a matter of historical fact to show that Bahrein had been Persian territory prior to 1783, the fact that she has never expressly recognised Bahrein’s independence affords, in our view, no foundation tor her present claim. We agree with the arguments on this point m paragraphs o to o of Sir Austen Chamberlain’s letter of the 18th February, 1929. j n ,^ Upon a review of all the facts as stated in the memorandum and ot the arguments advanced in the course of the correspondence in recent years, we are of opinion that Persia has no rights, either of sovereignty or suzerainty, m or over Bahrein.

The very conflicting evidence available goes to show H i that Bahrein was subject to Persian rule for a period in the Sections early part of the Christian era, and between .A.

It is stated to have been conquered by one Keshan bin Abdul Malik, and to have come under the sway of the Oommiyyad Caliphs, in the latter year, and to have remained para ‘2 ’ under the control of the Caliphs until the close of the W1 Abbaside dynasty in the 11th century, when it again became PersBnGulf subject to chiefs of its own race.

In 1602 the Portuguese were forcibly expelled from the islands by the Persians. Ihe i crsian occupation was of uncertain duration, and in their Note of 2nd Auoust 1928 they refer to 1622 as the date on which Peffa regaled possession of Bahrein. They appear m any event to have had a military dep6t m Bahrein m 1622 Gurzon states that “ the Portuguese • • ■ 111 1G ‘'° concluded a treaty with Shah Abbas, by which they restored to hm all his^ coast possessions, retaining only the pearl banks at Bahrein. ...” 4. In or about 1713 the islands were occupied by the Arabs of Muscat, who, however, appear to have mamtamei their occupation for a short time only. It is not clear whether at the date of this attack the islands were derelict or whether they were held by a Persian garrison. About 1753 the Ruler under the Persian government of the town of Bushire made a descent upon Bahrein, the chief lesiuen tribe in which (the Huwalah Arabs—at the present day still strongly represented in the islands) was seriously divided b/internal feuds, and established Ins authority there. In this manner the islands again became, at least m name, dependent on Persia. In 1782 the Arabs of Zubarah, on the Arabian mainland, efforts to reduce which had been made by the Governor of Bahrein under the Persians m the vears immediately preceding that date, retaliated by a descent on the island of. Bahrein. They defeated the ' Persian Governor, drove him to his tort, plundered and destroyed the town of Manama, and took possession of a Busline vessel, with which they retired to Zubarah. A counter attack was repulsed, and m the following year the Ilttabi Arabs of Zubarah, assisted by contingents from various tribes of Qatar, occupied the Bahrein islands the Persian garrison of the Manama Fort capitulating on 28th Julv 1783, after a siege of about two months duration, and being allowed to return to Bushire. Summary. r n w iH be seen that while the histoiy of Bahrein • nr 1783 is very obscure, it would appear that lersia C ht inconsiderable periods exercised control over the islands The nature of that control is not, however, very clear - 'it seems probable that it was only very rarely of a definite character; and even in more recent periods3 Persian relations with the islands were for a substantial number of years interrupted by Portuguese occupation of or overlordship over them.

In 1811 the islands were freed from Wahabi rule by the Imam of Muscat, when the Uttabis were restored to power, though according to a claim subsequently made by by the Imam, in subordination to Muscat. In 1816 the Uttabis sought the protection of the Wahabi rulers of Central Arabia, and the Imam of Muscat undertook an armed expedition against Bahrein, explaining to the British authori ties that he was compelled so to act by the repudiation by the Attabis of bis suzerainty, which they had admitted in 1811, by their alliance with the Wahabis and bv their piratical practices. The Muscat expedition, to which three Bushire vessels were added by the Persian Government, effected a landing in the summer of 1816, but was signally repulsed and withdrew. Unsuccessful negotiations took place later in the same year between Muscat and the Persian Bo. Sel., Government with a view to a fresh attempt on Bahrein. ^XIV, 372. Subsequently, but apparently in the same year, a Persian emissary, one Sikander Khan, arrived in Bahrein, who this was, of comse, incorrect, turkey does not appear to have held the island since 1559 and then only for a few months.4 Teli. Desp. No. 6 of 16.4.1817. accepted presents from the Sheikhs of Bahrein for tie Prince of Shiraz and conferred on them in return Persian Robes of Honour. 10. In April 1817 His Majesty’s Minister in Persia reported the arrival at Tehran of an agent from the Imam of Muscat, the object of whose mission was credibly stated to be to inform the Shah that His Majesty s Government contemplated the capture of Bahrein, and to ask lor armed assistance for the Imam in order that he might thwart their design by taking possession of the island m the name ol t e Persian Government. His Majesty’s representative stated that an agent of the Sheikh of Bahrein was also at Tehran, bearing a letter which stated that as the inhabitants ot the island were of the same sect as the natives of Persia, they had always looked up to the Persian monarch as their protector and head, and that they therefore hoped for the assistance of His Majesty to cloak them from the oppressions of the Wahabis. Approval for the grant of the military assistance desired was stated to have been given by the bhah to the Imam, but no action appears to have followed. 11. In 1818, on the appearance of the Egyptians inHasa, the Sheikh of Bahrein appears to have offered to assist them Lor. 1,846. with sea transport. In February 1819 the Sheikh enteieo into an agreement with the British Government, with the terms of which he subsequently failed to comply, for preventing the sale of captured British property in his dominions, and in the same year he expressed great indignation at the violation by the British authorities, undei a misapprehension as to the nationality of ceitam vessels, of the neutrality of his port. Teh. Desp. No. 10 of 6.5.1817. Teh. Desp. 12. On the 19th April 1819 His Majesty’s Representative No. 16 of at Tehran reported to the Government of India that the 25.5.1819. I mam of Muscat had complained bitterly against the non- fulfilment of the engagements contracted with him by the Persian Government for the capture of Bahrein. The Minister added that letters received by him showed that the troops of Ibrahim Pasha, the Viceroy of Egypt, had occupied Bahrein (this appears to have been incorrect) and that the Imam had suggested to the Shah that he should send a messenger to the Pasha asking him to evacuate the island. The Imam is stated to have urged upon the Shah the necessity of endeavouring to recover a possession which according to him “ had for ages acknowedged the sovereignty of Persia.” He was, however, unsuccessful, and in June 1819 His Majesty’s Minister reported that the Shah had “ for the present ” dropped all intention of taking any steps in pursuit of his pretensions to the sovereignty of the island. It may be added here that the Government of Bombay in a despatch of 21st J uly 1819 to the Government of India, in which they discussed the desirability of assisting the Imam of Muscat, in return for assistance in connection with the expedition proposed against the Gulf pirates, to establish his claims to Bahrein, referred to an “ arrangement some time since concerted ” between the Shah and the Imam, whereby the former “had agreed to relinquish all claims to the island of Bahrein in favour of the Imam, under the condition of receiving a portion of its revenues.” Bahrein submits to Muscat, 1820. 13. The Persians, at the beginning of 1820, moved apparently by a desire to anticipate any attempt by Muscat to establish 'control over Bahrein with the support of His Majesty’s Government, unsuccessfully requested the Imam to convey their troops to Bahrein. They addressed a similar0 application, equally unsuccessful, to the Commander of the r , c,- fnaot Ex P 1 edltl0 f I1 R “ Persian Gulf. In the earlv part of ’ 847 ' 1820 the rulers of Bahrein made full submission to the Imam of Muscat and agreed to pay him a tribute of 30,000 dollars An instalment (12,000 dollars) of this tribute appears subsequently to have been actually remitted. PP Policy of British Government, 1819-20. • . t0 be adopted by the British Government m regard to Bahrein was examined between the Government oi Bombay and the Government of India in 1819-20 and was ultimately defined as one of complete neutrality. ’ The Govt of ransfei of Bahrein to the Imam of Muscat had been contem- Bombay to plated, but this project, so far as the British Government G - of L &gt; were concerned, whs now abandoned. The Government of 15121 f ^ Bombay suggested that the Sheikh should be informed that ^ 2 ' 3 - so long as he restrained his subjects from piracy he would reap the advantage of a friendly neutrality on the part of Britain, whereas should a piratical spirit manifest itself forcible measures of coercion would be applied to him.

On the 17th January 1820 the Sheikh agreed to surrender certain pirate craft which had taken refuge in his territories, and undertook to the British Government not to. admit any more boats of the same character until authorised to do so by the British authorities. On the 5th February 1820 a preliminary Treaty of Peace was signed between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government, and on the 23rd February 1820 the Sheikhs were admitted to the benefits of the General Treaty of Peace which had been made between His Majesty’s Government and the Arab rulers of the Persian Gulf and under which His Majesty’s Government undertook, in return for abstention by those rulers from piracy and the slave trade, that “if any shall attack them the British Government shall take notice of it” (Article 10). The Sheikh of Bahrein went so far as to claim subsequently that the treaty in question established relations of protection and dependence between the British Government and himself, but it was made clear to him by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf while on a visit to Bahrein in 1823 that this was not the case.

The Shah had replied that he wished that advices should be received from Shiraz before the mediation of the British Government to render Bahrein a tributary to 1 eisia can be accepted.” Sir H. Willock remarked that the great repugnance of the Shah to the formation of any British settlement in the neighbourhood of Bersia was strongly manifested by His Majesty's not immediately accepting the British mediation to obtain a tribute from the island o Bahrein, an object which he so urgently desired and which His Majesty was aware must at a future period be difficult of attainment from the already advanced stage of negotia tions between the Sheikhs of Bahrein and the Imam ot Muscat.’ ? -.,1 .7 r\ » + Si rv n Si ( I /S /'I I i 18 On the 3rd October .1820 the Government of Bombay instructed Sir H. Willock to take the earliest opportunity of informing the Persian Government “ that as our vievvs cue exclusively limited to the extirpation of piracy, it would be contrary to our policy, in the present state of the Gull, to afford the mediation we formerly offered between His Majesty [the Shah] and the Uttabis of Bahrein. Summary, 1783-1820. 19. In 1799 the Sheikhdom, independent since 1783, professed allegiance to Persia and paid a year s tribute, but it was immediately afterwards conquered by the Imam of Muscat, and thereafter fell under the influence and ultimately the control of the Wahabi Amir. Liberated by Muscat in 1811, it appealed to the Wahabis in 1816 against the Imam and defeated him. In 1816 or 1817 a Persian envoy was received at Bahrein and presents exchanged. While no details are available as to what precisely took place on this occasion, the incident had no effective sequel. Persian authority was not asserted in the island between the date of the visit and 1820, and in the latter year the island became temporarily subject and tributary to Muscat. In 1820 Bahrein' entered into its first formal treaty with the British Government, and that Government, on condition that the Sheikhs abstained from piracy, undertook to “ take notice ” “ if any shall attack them.” IV.—1820-30. Capfc. Bruce to Govt, of Bombay, 3.9.1822. Unauthorised Agreement between Captain Bruce and the Prince Governor of Shiraz, 1822. 20. In 1822 Captain Bruce, then Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, acting on his own initiative and without any authority from or prior reference to Government, having proceeded of his own accord to Shiraz there signed an agreement with the Minister of the Prince Governor of Shiraz, on the part of Persia. This agreement alleged, inter alia, in regard to Bahrein, that the islands had always been subordinate to the Governor of Ears, against whose authority the Uttabi Sheikhs had lately become rebellious; that the flag assigned to the Uttabis of Bahrein under the General Treaty of Peace with Britain in 1820 should accordingly, if already granted, be withdrawn, that no assistance should in future he rendered by Britain to the Uttabis of Bahrein, and that on the contrary the British Government should, if requested, assist the Persians against Bahrein with “ one or two ” vessels of war. In other words, the title of Persia to the possession of Bahrein was explicitly admitted. The arguments which carried weight with Captain Bruce in concluding this unauthorised agreement appear to have been7 Stated that ° ft i ° f • Prmce Re g eut °f Fare (which iaiea tiiat it is not the intention of this Governmprn tn of the aD Per P shn e ''uY'T™ °. f the Several P «^r S and States a ^ewa^of ^ 0 ”^“ than be —-ary to prevent the flag [granted to the Uttabis] to give 3 offefce^Peraia 11 as there 1S not the smallest connection between it and on the part “the‘ rvT'p 81 pretolsio11 to superiority Muscat and the She n fp Government”), the Imam of scat, and the Sheikh of Bahrein, and as a mark of dis- refffdTt 1 ! he i WaS r, 0 ™ 1 £rom his appointment.

In August 1822 an attack by Muscat on Bahrein seeming in consequence imminent, the Governor of Bombay, in letters to the Sheikh and to the Imam of Muscat, suggested that if this tribute was of ancient origin it should be regularly paid, but that otherwise it should be dropped. In January 1823 the I olitical .Resident (Lieut. McLeod) visited Bahrein to leassure the Sheikhs in regard to the unratified treaty concluded by Captain Bruce with the Prince Governor of k-hiraz, and to inform them that that treaty was of no effect and that no chang-e of policy was contemplated by Govern- ment. In the spring of 1823, on rumours of a contemplated joint attack on Bahrein by Persia, Muscat and the Arabs of the mainland, the Minister at Tehran was asked at a suitable juncture to dissuade the Persians from disturbing' the tranquillity of the Gulf.

Internal dissension in the ruling family became more marked between 1834 and 1839, and the imsgovernment of the island continued to grow with unfortunate effects on its prosperity. His Majesty’s Government, although m 1831 they had to take forcible measures against the Sheikh to secure reparation for an insult to their Residency Agent in Bahrein, were, however, content to abstain from any interference in the internal affairs of Bahrein so long as the Sheikhs discharged the obligations undertaken by then Treaty of 1820.

In 1835 the British Government renewed the maritime truce which they had imposed in 1820 on the Arab rulers of the Gulf in the interest of the suppression of piracy. The Sheikh of Bahrein was not, however, included in the renewed truce, partly apparently because ne had behaved so well that this was thought unnecessary, partly because he could be easily punished m the event of this- proving desirable, and partly lest in the event of his inclusion he might claim British intervention if attacked by Muscat In March 1836 the Sheikh agreed, however, to the Lor.

Egyptian Invasion of Hasa : Sheikh professes to be a Persian Subject, 1839 . tlle Egyptians conquered Hasa and cap tured the Wahabi Amir. They thereupon demanded the payment of tribute and certain territorial concessions from the Sheikh of Bahrein. The Egyptian Commander about the same time intimated to the British authorities his inten tion to attack and reduce the island. The Sheikh appealed foi assistance to the Government of India, but in the absence of instructions from Her Majesty’s Government the Govern ment of India were at first not prepared to give him any pledge and the Slieikli was instructed to decide for fuinself as to waiting on the Egyptian representative. Much alarmed by the proceedings of the Egyptians, “and perhaps even more so by a rumour, apparently well founded, that the Saiyed of Oman was intriguing with the Egyptians to obtain ^and hold Bahrein as a fief under the Viceroy of Egypt,” the Sheikh thereon professed, in reply to demands made on him in the name of the Egyptians, to be a subject of the Persian Government. Apparently as the result of overtures by the Sheikh designed to substantiate this, the Prince Governor of Shiraz thereupon sent an envoy—one Haji Qasim, formerly supercargo of a trading vessel—to reside in Bahrein as Persian agent, “ and to be the medium of receiving and transmitting the annual tribute which the Persian authorities vainly flattered themselves the Bahrein Chief was^ disposed to pay for their countenance and protection,” and to bear a Robe of Honour and a letter to the Sheikh. The envoy was accompanied by a guard of 10 Persian infantry. No details appear to be available about his mission, which was apparently a failure. 33. On 1st April 1839 Admiral Sir F. Maitland, then commanding the Gulf Squadron, was instructed by the Government of Bombay to give the Sheikh all support agaiust the Egyptians, short of actually entering on hostilities. If the Sheikh asked for a new engagement with Her Majesty’s Government he should offer to transmit his proposals to India. The Resident was simultaneously to send a formal protest to the Egyptians. On the 18th April 2953 c Lor. I, 862. Bombay Selections, XXIV, 388. Precis, 375, Govt, of Bombay to Res.,No. 661, dated 4.1839 Vti iLor. I, 864. Lor. I, 865. Bombay Selections, XXIY, 389. Pol.

Hertslet, 1874, p. 5. the Government of India empowered the Admiral, if the Sheikh claimed British intervention and offered to place his territories under British protection, ^ to assure him of the temporary protection of Her Majesty s squadron in the Gulf,” to inform the Egyptians that this pledge had been given and to urge them to abstain from futher military proceedings until the views of both Governments were known, failing which Bahrein would be defended against intervention by them until the pleasure of Her Majesty’s Government had been communicated to the local authorities. In the same month the Sheikh promised the Assistant Political Resident to take no steps to place himself under the authority or protection of a foreign Power without first consulting the Political Resident. Sheikh submits to Egyptians (July 1839). 34. In July 1839 the Sheikh “suddenly and un expectedly” acknowledged the supremacy of the Egyptians and agreed to pay them a tribute of 2,000 dollars a year, on the understanding that his local authority would be observed and that no representative of the Egyptians would be sent to reside in Bahrein. The Resident protested in writing to both the Sheikh and the Egyptians, and expostulated with the Sheikh on the way in which he was sacrificing his independence.. The Sheikh explained that his action was the result of the refusal of Her Majesty’s Government to give him advice or a specific assurance of support. For a trifling financial payment he had now secured immunity from interference. He offered, however, in return for a written and distinct pledge of protection, to repudiate his agreement with the Pasha and to avow himself a dependent of Her Majesty’s Government; but on being pressed he refused to confirm this in writing and said that in any event it would be necessary for him to justify his change of attitude to the Egyptians on the ground that it was the result of compulsion by Her Majesty’s Government. 1839-40. Views of Her Majesty’s Government on future Policy towards Bahrein. 35. As a consequence of the activities of the Egyptians discussion appears about this time to have taken place as to the desirability of declaring a regular protectorate over Bahrein. On 1st July 1839 the Secret Committee of the East India Company informed the Government of India that if necessary they would “ not disapprove of your entering into an engagement with the Chief of Bahrein to protect him against encroachments from Mehemet Ali, but we concur in the doubt expressed by Captain Hennell [then Political Resident] as to whether it would be expedient for that island to be taken under the protection of the British Government.” On 24th February 1840 the Foreign Office wrote to the India Board (with reference to an enquiry from the Bombay Government) that it was important that the Egyptian troops should not be allowed to take possession of Bahrein and that if the Company’s troops could occupy it, even provisionally, such a measure could not fail to be attended with advantage. On the retirement of the Egyptians from Hasa in 1840 their relations with the Sheikh came to an end. Summary, 1830-40. 36. From 1831-33 Bahrein was subject and tributary to the Wahabi Amirs.

In November 1842 he was given permission by Her Majesty’s Lor. I, 866. Government to attack Sheikh Abdullah. After a civil war which lasted from January to April 1843, Abdullah was expelled by Mohamed, who thereafter held the Sheikhdom, no reply being sent to an appeal to restrain the attackers which was made by Abdullah to the British authorities in February 1843. Intrigues of ex-Sheikii, 1843-49. 40. Between 1843 and 1849 the ex-Sheikh appealed at various times for the assistance of the Wahabis, the Trucial Sheikhs, the Sheikh of Koweit, and the British and Persian authorities to enable him to recover his position. In 1843 Lor. I, 873. Her iVIajesty’s Government dissuaded Muscat from trying to conquer Bahrein—considerations which weighed with them being mter alia the risk of provoking the Wahabis and the danger of giving Persia an excuse to espouse the cause of the ex-Sheikh. In the same year the ex-Sheikh twice visited Bushire, where he failed to find any consolation from the Resident, who, on his stating that if disappointed by Her Majesty’s Government he was ready to throw himself into the arms of Persia, informed him (October 1843) that the adherence of Persia to his cause would not be recognised by Britain unless it was open and declared. 41. In the course of his visits the ex-Sheikh entered into discussions with the nephew r of the Persian Sheikh of Bushire, who, while holding no official position himself,12 Teh. Desp. 86, Oct. 1843. Lor. I, 875. promised him military assistance from Persia. On repre sentations being thereupon made to the Persmn Pr me Mi'niotpr hv Her Maiesty s Minister at Lenran, Me i line Minister “ mformed me that Sheikh Suleiman had acted with Ireat presumpTon in having interfered in politmal affairs without having any authority from the Gpvernmem, amUe ctflirl tint he would reprimand him for his conduct. Excellency added that Bahrein belonged to Persia and that she would 7 take possession of it when more pressing affairs were disposed of. As I looked on this as mere idle boasting which was never likely to be ^fulfilled, I thought it unnecessary to pursue the conversation. 42. It may be recorded that on a second visit of the ex-Sheikh to Bushire from December lb43 to Maicli 18 , he is stated to have been received with distinction by t e Persians, and to have offered, if reinstated to DDb t]ie c&lt; ? s . ’ to remit in future a large annual tribute to the Shah and to leave one son as a hostage in Persia. His proposals were not, however, accepted by the Persian Government. 43. In 1844 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was instructed by the Government of India to resist by force any attempt by Persia to establish troops on the island of F.O.toTeh,, Bahrein. During the same year the ex-Sheikh, having while residing at Naband in South Persia, captured two Bahreini vesselsfthe ruling Sheikh appealed to the Resident, with the result that an injunction was issued by the Central I ersian Government at the instance of the British envoy directing the Governor-General of Ears to compel Sheikh Abdulla to give up the boats he had taken and abstain from distuibmg the peace of the Gulf.

Consequent on indications that Persia intended to- intervene in the succession at Bahrein on behalf of the ex-Sheikh Abdullah the general question of policy was considered by Her Majesty’s Government m the early part of 1844, in the light of an intimation by the Government of India that they would see the strongest objections to any such interference by Persia, which could not but react adversely on British interests. As a result, Her Majesty’s Minister was informed (Foreign Office Despatch to Tehran*. No. 23, dated 1st May 1844) that “ the question of the right of Persia to interfere and of the Indian Government to prevent interference necessarily depends upon the validity of the pretension put forward by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein. Her Majesty’s Government are ignorant of the grounds of such pretension, and, assuming those grounds to be insufficient, they would claim for the British Govern ment the right to prevent, if it accorded with its policy to do so, any direct interposition of Persia in the quarrels of rival claimants to the possession of Bahrein. The British Government in India at present consider that any such disturbance as may be occasioned by military operations on the part of Persia directed against the island of Bahrein would be injurious to British interests, and, therefore, unless Persia can show that she has a clear and indis putable right to the sovereignty of Bahrein; that she has exercised it without interruption under the dynasty of the Kajar family ; that consequently her present policy is directed to the maintenance of her lawful claims and not to the assertion of a pretension not founded on law, she must be13 prepared to encounter in any schemp of tVn'a i * opposition of the British Government in ndh” l T™ circumstances the Minister whs t J , ‘ ' • , tllese Wd wiSgreTthltAlt G Her had' part in the disputes respecting7h“™^ right of Persia to interfere in the matter is It 7^ the any interference on her nart t lh , be / 0Ild d 'V«te, discussions with TTn i ,i mi eht lead to unpleasant discussions w th England.

In February 1845 the Minister at Tehran sent home T w Fn a letter received from the Prime Minister, from which it L i^of’ 0 ' appeared that the I ersian claim was essentially based on the 25.2.1845. Convention of 1822 between Captain Bruce and the Minister of the Prince Governor of Fars. (See paragraphs 20-21 , 4?. In a subsequent despatch the Minister said that he Teh. toF.O had informed the I rime Minister that the Bruce Agreement ^ 0 - of was unauthorised and had been repudiated at the time and 18 - 3 - 1 845. that the Prune Minister had thereupon sent him a fuller statement of the grounds of the Persian claim. The result of enquiries which His Majesty’s Minister had made con sequent on the receipt of this statement “confirmed me in the opinion that this island has not formed part of the dominions of i eisia since the accession of the Fajar dynasty [1795]. It is true that the Chiefs of Bahrein have in all probability from time to time given peeshkesh, offerings, or tribute to this country [Persia] as a mark of superiority, as Kandahar and Herat continue to do, without an acknow ledgment of subjection, 0 and it is also not unlikely that the rulers of that island may have declared themseives to be subjects of the Shah when threatened with subjugation from Bagdad, but I cannot ascertain that Persia has exercised any real control over it within the last 50 or 60 years.” The Minister added that in further support of their claim the Persian Government had sent him a gold coin struck at Bahrein in 1817 in the name of Fateh Ali Shah Kajar, which he believed to be genuine. 48. The fuller statement of claim put forward by the Secret Oom- Persian Government was investigated by the Secret Com- to BT mittee of the East India Company, who, after detailed 31.7.1845°. examination of it, reached the conclusion “that Persia has' no legitimate claim to the sovereignty of Bahrein.” It may be remarked that the Persian claim was largely based on a general claim that the Persian Gulf from the Shatt-el- Arab to Muscat and all the islands in it belonged to * On this point the Secret Committee of the East India Company remarked : “ Presents and complimentary messages do not imply an acknowledgment of sovereignty, arid they have not been confined to Persia.” (Secret Committee to India Board, 31st July 1845.) 2953 D14 Persia; that the employment in En f lis £ of “ Pprsian Gulf ” was itself evidence of this, that trom about 1300 A.

The object and uesire c&gt;f the Persian Government has since always been and is the recovery of that island from its spoilers. 49. Her Majesty’s Government, in view of the unlikeli hood* that Persia had, or could give effect to, any serious designs in Bahrein and the undesirability of engaging m those circumstances in a correspondence which might meie y cause irritation without serving any useful purpose, instructed the Minister at Tehran not to revert to tiie subject unless it was forced upon him by the Persian Prime Minister. In that case he was to employ certain arguments supplied to him (apparently the critical comments of the Secret Committee of the East India Company on the Prime Minister’s memorandum) to show generally the grounds on F.O. to Teh. w hich Her Majesty’s Government were “ unable to recognise *r°- 38 of a8 valid t i ie claims advanced by Persia to the sovereignty of 7.8 1845.

Meanwhile, the ex-Sheikh (who in 1845 had unsuccess- Lor. 1, 877. fully attempted to capture Bahrein with the aid of the Wahabis) bad been invited in June 1846 by the Governor- Lor. I, 877. General of Ears to return to Bushire, where he should be liberally entertained “ until ... the season for action had Lor. I, 880. arrived,” but he declined the invitation. In October 1846 the Wahabi Amir asked the permission of the Resident to call in the Trucial Sheikhs of the Arab littoral against Bahrein. This was refused. A request by the ruling Sheikh of Bahrein to be allowed to call in the assistance of the Sheikh of Debai against the Wahabis was equally refused in November 1846. In August 1847 a Treaty of Peace was concluded between the Wahabi Amir and the ruling Sheikh, under which the ruling Sheikh agreed to pay a tribute of 4,000 dollars a year, while the Wahabi Amir agreed not to encourage the ex-Sheikh.

The Court or Unectors concurred in the Government of Bombay’s recommendation “ that any attempts upon Bahrein ought to be resisted by the British Naval Force” and that the Kesident should be so informed. 55. On 11th October 1847 the Foreign Office, in a letter to the India Board, in which they referred to recent Turkish assurances that the Turkish Government had no intention of using compulsion with regard to Bahrein, added that “ if fhe Indian Government has any further apprehensions on the subject, and if the Bahrein Chief is really an independent ruler, the best course would be to make w r ith him a treaty of alliance which would secure his independence and his friendly connection with England.” The Resident, who deemed it inexpedient that Her Majesty’s Government should involve itself in the embarrassments likely to arise from a closer alliance with Bahrein (letter of 25th January 1848), was, however, opposed to making the existing connection closer, as were the Secret Committee of the East India Company, who expressed the view that the Resident “had exercised a wise discretion in not taking any step for the negotiation of a new treaty with Bahrein.” The Resident was, at the same time, authorised, while avoiding discussion with the Turks, to ascertain whether the Sheikh was inclined to enter into a closer connection with Her Majesty’s Government.

Persian Protest, 1848. 57 During the course of these discussions, the Persian Government protested against British interference in the affairs of Bahrein, whereupon the y '™ re Minister at Tehran m February 1848 that the J&gt;nasn Government were unable to recognise as valid the claims advanced by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein. Designs of Muscat, 1849. 58. In June 1849 the Imam-of Muscat, haying intimated his desire to send an expedition to takepossession of Bahrein, and having asked the opinion of Her Majesty s Government, was strongly dissuaded from doing so by Her Majesty s Government. Summary, 1840-50. 59. The ruling Sheikh was expelled m 1843 and con tinued to intrigue to regain the throne till his death m 18 , appealing for assistance during this period to the \Y alia ms, Persia, Muscat and Great Britain, in all cases unsuccessfully. In' 1847 Turkey asserted a claim to Bahrein, in the same year the islands submitted themselves to the Wahabi Amir and agreed to pay tribute to him. # Claims by Persia were advanced, but rejected, m loM- 45 and 1848. . . Muscat was dissuaded from attacking Bahrein m 1849. Her Majesty’s Government, on consideration of the policy to be adopted m regard to Bahiem, decided against establishing a protectorate and refused a request put for ward in 1849 by the Sheikh to be taken under British protection. They assured him at the same time of then general goodwill, and their deliberations made it clear that they regarded the island as independent, but were reluctant to assume further responsibility in relation 10 it so long as its independence and the performance of the engagements undertaken by the Sheikh could be secured without their doing so. Disputes with Wahabis, 1850-51. 60. In 1850 the Resident found it necessary to take disciplinary action against the ruling Sheikh—an individual of “ irresponsible character.” Consequent on strained relations between the Sheikh and the Wahabi Amir, the Amir, with whom the sons of the ex-Sheikh Abdulla were Lor I, 884. associated, in 1850-51 threatened Bahrein, whereupon the Sheikh “ against his own better judgment . . . tendered a small annual tribute to the Amir,” a circumstance from which it may perhaps be inferred that he had failed to observe the agreement of 1847 referred to in paragraph 50 above. The Amir rejected the offer and made exorbitant demands instead. The Sheikh was about to succumb to a combination of the sons of the ex-Sheikh and the W ahabi Amir “ when a British squadron arriving off Bahrein took the islands under their protection.” Peace was subsequently made with the Wahabis in July 1851.

The Sheikh’s internal government continued to ^o from bad to worse. In September 1858 reparation was secured from him for the ill-treatment of British subjects in Bahrein. In 1859 a Wahabi attack was averted by British intervention. The local Wahabi Governor sued for pardon Lor T 887 to the Senior Naval Officer; the Wahabi ruler, however! L ° r - I ’ 8b7 - made a formal protest, asserted his authority over Bahrein,’ and declared that he was himself a vassal of the Sultan of Turkey. The Resident, in reply, informed him of the determination of Her Majesty’s Government to preserve the independence of Bahrein, and pointed out the inconsistency of his. piratical attacks on Turkish shipping with his professions of dependence on the Ottoman Government.

Views of the Minister at Tehran and the Government of Bombay. 68 The Minister at Tehran regarded the matter as one of relatively small importance. He pointed out to the Persian Government “ that under no circumstances can the British Government be expected to concur in the proposed transfer of the sovereignty of Bahrein to the I Gtot n, since we have contracted engagements with the Arab Sheikhs of the island as independent Chiefs, and since the mainten ance of their independence is indispensable to t ie successful working of those plans of maritime police m the t ersian Gulf which we have been at so much pains and expense to establish ” ; and obtained an assurance from Persia that no military occupation of Bahrein should be attempted unti , the title to the island had been settled through the diplomatic channel. He advised the Resident that, while hostilities against Bahrein were to be repelled by force, a voluntary tender of allegiance by the Sheikh to any other 1 ower might, so long as it was unaccompanied by any military occupation, be ignored as of no particular importance. In the light of the Minister’s views the Government of Bombay instructed the Resident that he should not interfere with the occupation of Bahrein, whether by Persia or Turkey, save by protest and by an intimation that the matter had been referred to Her Majesty’s Government \ but at tlie same time tliat tne agents of both Powers (Turkey and Persia; should be warned that aggression by or m the name of Bahrein on neighbour- ing tribes would not be allowed and would, if necessary, be prevented by force. In representing the matter to the Secretary of State for India they urged that in the interests of the peace of the Gulf it would be better that Bahrein should he regarded as independent and as subject neitner to Turkey nor to Persia, that its independence should be recognised, and the engagements into wfliich in the interests of humanity we had entered with its rulers for the preservation of the peace and good order of the Gulf should be maintained. Her Majesty’s Government decide that Bahrein shall be REGARDED AS INDEPENDENT (1861). I. 0. to F.O., 69. In February 1861 Her Majesty’s Government, after II. 2.61. discussion between the India Office and the loieign Office, k.O. to I.O., approved the recommendation of the Government of 12 ' 2 p 6 q\ c Bombav. The Resident and the Minister at Tehran were so of I. No.°2, informed. During part of the time at any rate that the 18.2.61. question was under consideration in London the 1 Turkish and Persian agents or their representatives appear (though it is not clear how consistently) to have remained in Bahrein, and the flags of both Powers to have been flown19 40 ? simultaneously.

No. x, 234. Une oi the ships seized from him was thereupon returned • the second, the Harnrah, was retained. 71. The Turkish and Persian agents would seem to have Pol Ee , tn disappeared from Bahrein before tlie Resident’s arrival. The Teh No. 20 Persian authorities at Bushire in June 1861 asked the 8.6.i’861. Resident for an explanation of his proceedings. The Resident, however, contented himself with forwarding their enquiry to Hei Majesty s Minister at lehran. The Convention was approved by the Government of India in 1861, and the Turkish and Persian Governments were informed of what had happened. Summary, 1850-61. 72. The Turkish Government were informed in 1851 that Her Majesty’s Government could not recognise any claim on their part to Bahrein. The Sheikhs appear to have continued to pay tribute to the Wahabi Amir in the early part of and possibly through out this period. In 1859 the Sheikh appealed simultaneously to Turkey and to Persia, as the result of apprehensions of a Wahabi attack, and received a Persian envoy, who hoisted the Persian flag. On the arrival immediately afterwards of the Turkish envoy the Persian flag was hauled down. Sub sequently the Sheikh for a time flew both flags side by side. The envoys seem to have left Bahrein in the early part of 1861. No action was taken by the British authorities pending a decision by Her Majesty’s Government as to whether they regarded Bahrein as independent. The Persian Government undertook not to endeavour to occupy the islands until the title to them was settled. Her Majesty’s Government decided in February 1861 to regard the Sheikh as an independent ruler and so hold him responsible for piracies, &amp;c. Punitive action against him by Her Majesty’s Government having proved necessary in May 1861, he entered in that month into a convention with them in which he was described as “ independent ruler of Bahrein,” and secured certain guarantees of protection.Lord Cowley to F.O., No, 15, 7.7.1862.

Persian Protest (1866). 74 Between 1863 and 1865 the Sheikh continued to misbehave, and in the latter year Ins sh.p he Wed under the instructions of the Resident, ihe l ersia Government in 1866 made a complaint m regard to the Dinar proceedings on the ground that Bahrein under the unratified agreement of 1822 was a dependency of Persia. The Government of India, after ascertammg from the Government of Bombay the nature of the agreement of 182-1, communicated the result of their enquines to the Minister at Tehran, and added their own opinion that whatever might have been the pretensions of Persia or the grounds or tlnfsame to the sovereignty of Bahrein in former days, t Shah could not now be regarded as possessing m point of fact any rights in the principality.” This communication was approved by Her Majesty’s Government m the same year, and the matter appears to have dropped. Nature of Relations between Bahrein and Wahabi Amir (1867). 75. In 1866-67 the Resident, on the instructions of the Government of India, investigated the relations of the bheikh of Bahrein and the Wahabi Amir. He reported as a result that the Sheikh claimed to be independent so far as Ins islands were concerned, and that the annual tribute of 4 000 dollars “ which be indubitably paid (ep. paragraph 50 above) to the Amir was on account of the possessions held by him in Qatar on the Arabian mainland, the object of the payment being to secure those possessions against attacks by Arab tribes under Wahabi influence. The Government ol India in the light of the Resident’s investigation, expressed the view in March 1867 that the Sheikh was independent oi all other Powers in respect of his insular possessions and owed fealtv to the Wahabis only in regard to Qatar. Summary, 1861-67. 76 This period is marked by assertions of the Persian claim in 1862 and 1866. Her Majesty’s Government on both occasions made it clear that they could not regard that claim as well founded. /i Q £~\ x Investigation showed that the tribute still paid (Ibb/j py the Sheikh to the Wahabi Amir was ip respect of Bahreini possessions on the mainland of Arabia, and not in respect of Bahrein, which the Sheikh held independently of all other Powers. IX.—Discussions and Incidents, 1868-70. 77. Questions of considerable importance as bearing on the status of Bahrein arose in 1868—/0 consequent on (a) the disciplinary action taken by the Government of India against the ruling Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa, in view of bis breaches of the Maritime Truce of 1820, which resulted in his flight from Bahrein in September 1868 and the succession as sole Sheikh of his brother, Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa; (b) the punitive action taken at Bahrein by the Govern ment of India in November—December 1869, consequent on the invasion of Bahrein by the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa, the murder of Sheikh21 Busliire Desp. 3 of 25.9.1868.

Perslan allegations that over- tures to 1 eisia had been made by the ruling Sheikh, Ali bin hahfa, and by the ex-Sheikh, Md. bin Khalifa, and of the misleading but categorical accusations made against the Resident by the lersian Government, it seems desirable to examine m some detail the correspondence which passed and tne sequence of events. Punitive Expedition of August—September 1868. 7 i 9 i' co ^ se( l ne nt on an attack on Qatar by the bheikli of Bahrein, the Government of India resolved to' take rv? G1 lr na ; l 7 actlon a g ainst Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifa ihe bheikh sent an agent to Bush ire to satisfy the Resident but the agent having no powers from his master, his mission proved fruitless, and he returned to Bahrein in August 1868. An armed expedition was thereupon sent against the Sheikh in August-September of that year. Before it reached Bahrein the Sheikh fled to the Arab mainland, and he was thereafter regarded by the people of Bahrein and by Her Majesty’s Government as having abdicated the Sheikhdom. The expedition found it unnecessary to use any force, a full submission being made on its arrival by Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa, brother of Sheikh Mohamed, who had previously been associated with Sheikh Mohamed to some extent in the Sheikhship. An agreement was reached by the Political Resident with Sheikh Ali, which disposed of the matters in dispute, on 6th September 1868. The agreement was signed by “ Ali bin Khalifah and the inhabitants and subjects of Bahrein.” It declared inter alia that “ Md. bin Khalifah having repeatedly committed acts of piracy and other irregularities at sea, and having now, after his recent piratical acts, fled from Bahrein, has forfeited all claim to his title as principal Sheikh and Chief of Bahrein.” 80. Subsequently to the conclusion of this agreement the Resident, by way of punishment, destroyed the fort of Muharraq by gunfire and burnt certain vessels of war belonging to Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifah. His despatch, which contains a detailed report on the course of events, makes no reference to any flying of the Persian flag by Mohamed bin Khalifah, and the bombardment of Muharraq and the punitive destruction of the warships took place after the submission of Bahrein, and so after Mohamed bin Khalifah had fled from Ihe islands. Persian Protest, November 1868. 81. The facts appear to be as stated in the preceding paragraph. It was some time before a full account of these proceedings reached either India or London. Meanwhile, as will be seen from the correspondence, extracts of which Teh. Desp. are quoted below, the action of the Government of India 28 10 1868 drew a vigorous protest from the Persian Government, flhe protest, after appealing to the treaties concluded between Teh. Desp. England and Persia in 1809, in 1814, in 1822 (unratified) J^ijnses and in 1857, urged that the Resident, instead of respecting the rights of Persia in the Gulf to the extent provided for in those treaties, had, without any prior intimation to the Persian authorities, attacked Bahrein, which island had been and still was the property of Persia ; had bombarded and destroyed the Governor’s fort and house and caused considerable damage ; had appointed the Sheikh’s brother 2953 F Aitch.

Re was informed in reply that “the Sheikh of Bahrein was an independent chief with whom the British Government had treaty engagements and whom they must hold strictly to the performance of those engagements. This contention the Persian representative disputed, and in support of his view he forwarded letters addressed “ from 1858 to 1869 by the Sheikh of Bahrein to His Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Prince The translations of these letters are dated 9th Apnl and 1-th April 1869 respectively. From internal evidence it seems probable that they were, however, written m I860 on the occasion of the visit to Bahrein of the Persian envoy, Mirza Mehdi Khan (paragraph 67 above). They acknowledge the receipt of a Firman from the Mirza (apparently recognising Sheikh Md. as Sheikh and accompanying a Firman and a Sword of Honour for Sheikh Ali). They state emphatically that-Bahrein forms part of Persia, and has always done so They refer to an agreement reached for the future payment of tribute; remark that “the slight neglect which was lately shown on our part towards Your Imperial Majesty s Government was because they had not for a while superin tended and protected us, but as now the Government of W Imperial Majesty has intended by sending over Mirza Mehdy to enquire into and manage the affairs lieie, I, with in} brother and all the inhabitants, feel quite ready to declare at once that we are most willing to render any services required from us towards Your Majesty’s Government, being already aware that Bahrein (Persian Gulf) is part of Persia,” and add “ . . .

The question of the reply to be given to this further protest was carefully considered between the India Office and the Foreign Office.

The text (omitting an introductory paragraph) of the amended letter which is of importance as one of the principal pieces of evidence subsequently adduced by the Persian Government in support of their claim that Her Majesty’s Government have recognised Persian sovereignty over Bahrein, is as follows. The sentences in italics are those which were added m deference to the further representations from breneral Monsin Khan referred to above : — “ The British Government readily admit that the Government of the Shah has protested against the Persian right of sovereignty over Bahrein being ignored by the British Authorities, and they have given due consideration to that protest. But it is the fact, as yourself and the Government of the Shah are un doubtedly aware, that the Sheikhs of Bahrein have at different periods entered directly into engagements with the British Government; and I beg to assure you that the British Government hold the Sheikh to these engagements solely for the purposes of preventing Piracy and Slave Trade, and of maintaining the police of the Gulf. If the Persian Government are prepared to keep a sufficient force in the Gulf for these purposes, this country would be relieved of a troublesome and costly duty; but, if the Shah is uot prepared to undertake these duties, Her Majesty’s Government cannot suppose His Majesty would wish that in those waters disorder and crimes should be encouraged by impunity. “ I need scarce^ assure you of the friendly feelings entertained by Her Majesty’s Government towards Persia, and their desire on all occasions to meet as far as possible the wishes of the Shah ; and, in regard to this question, I have the honour to state to you that, whenever it is practicable to do so, Her Majesty’s Government will cause the Persian Government to be informed beforehand of any measures of coercion against himself which the conduct of the Sheikh of Bahrein may have rendered necessary. “ But the British Government cannot consent to debar its officers, to whom the superintendence of the police of24 Pol.

Her Majesty’s Minister further reported that “ Ali bin Khalifa having forwarded letters to this Couit admitting his allegiance to the Shah and offering his services to the Persian Government, an agent (Muza Mehdi K c who had been Persian Envoy to Bahrein in 1859 (para graph 67 above)) had been despatched with a Royal Firman, recognising Sheikh Ali bin Khalifah as Chief of Bahrein but that on receipt of the news of the murder of he r e^ bv the ex-Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifah, the 1 nman had been recalled and the name of the ex-Sheikh substituted (Hom paragraphs 94-5 below it will be seen that these statements subsequently proved to be incorrect m material particulars,. British Punitive Expedition (November—December 1869). 88 Punitive operations consequent on the murder of Sheikh Ali were undertaken by the British Government m November of the same year. Previous notification was given to the Persian Government of the grounds of this expedition, the object of which was stated to he “ to call the chief now Pol. Res. to in possession of Bahrein to account for his breach of the nvv, foi nf maritime peace and for the attack on Sheikh All . Dm Khalifah, who had been placed in power by the British Government.” . p ^ v &amp; • • , 89. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on receipt of the notification in question stated chat the ex-Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifah, who had, he said been the cause of the recent disturbances, had been killed (this was m fact incorrect); that the Resident’s action would therefore be useless, and that the Persian Government hoped that he would be telegraphically instructed not to proceed to Bahrein. He added that the Persian Government would themselves keep the affairs of Bahrein by land m order and that should anything happen to affect its affairs by sea they would request the British Government to send a naval force to put affairs in order, “ but up till now, the state Ox affairs m Bahrein had not fallen into disorder.” ^ 90 The Persian agent referred to m paragraph 8/ above arriving in the Gulf at this stage addressed letters to Sheikh Teh. tel. of 14.11.1869. 15.11.1869.

Sheikh Isa bin Ah becomes Sheikh. 91. The punitive operations against Bahrein resulted in the complete submission of Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah and the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah in September 1869. It may be remarked that prior to the opening of operations Sheikh Abdullah made overtures to the Resident, which were, how ever, rejected, with a view to securing recognition by His Majesty s Government. He also appealed to the Wahabi Amir for recognition and protection. Sheikh Isa bin Ali, son of the. murdered Sheikh Ali, voluntarily assumed the vacant Chiefship and was recognised by the Resident on behalf of the Government of India (“in no way did Colonel Felly influence the succession ”) and the ex-Sheikh and Mohammed bin Abdullah were deported to India. Shortly after his installation the new Sheikh received a letter from one Hydar Khan, Zabit of the Dashti district on the Persian coast, advising him to place himself under the Shah’s protection, but the incident appears to have been unim portant. Persian Protest, 1869-70. Views of Government of India. 98. I he Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs appears at first to have received news of the removal of the ex-Sheikh with equanimity and is said to have remarked that Persia and Great Britain had an equal interest in the maintenance of peace by sea and that Persia had therefore no reason to object to the punishment of the delinquent. But he protested in strong terms against the Resident’s action in preventing the Persian agent from landing and holding communication with the Sheikh, and a still stronger protest was made by the Persian Minister in London. The Govern ment of India, in the exhaustive reports they submitted on the Resident’s action, urged, after a review of the history of the islands, that the Shah had no legitimate control over the Sheikh of Bahrein ; that his Government had nevertheless encouraged the piratical faction in the Persian Gulf by sending letters of recognition to the piratical leader; that in styling Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah Chief of Bahrein the Persian Government ignored the facts that he had never held sway in Bahrein, belonged to the younger branch of the ruling family, and so had neither by right nor possession claim to this title; and that, so far from the Shah having any just cause of complaint against the Resident, the Persian Government should be called upon to give some explanation of the conduct of its officers in encouraging a piratical expedition which w r as prejudicial to British interests in the Persian Gulf and for the successive appointment by them of Ali bin Khalifa and Md. bin Khalifa to the sovereignty of a district over which they had no legitimate control. The Government of India added that they had no confirmation of the alleged overtures of Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa to Persia (paragraph 87 above), as to which further enquiry was being made of Her Majesty’s Minister 2953 Gr Bushire Desp. 216 of 15.12.1869.

Supplementary Reports hy Her Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, April Jo&lt;0. 94. On 6th April 1870 the Minister at Tehran reported as follows to the Government of India : - “In mv Despatch No. 81 . . . I reported that the Firman of appointment was originally in the name of Ali bin Khalifa, but that, on hearing of his dnath, it was altered in favour of his brother, Md. bin Khalifa This information had reached me from a relation of one of the principal Persian officials in Shiraz, an not . . . from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. When further intelligence reached Shiraz from t e Gulf and it was supposed that . Md. bin Abdulla would retain possession of Bahrein, the Firman was probably again altered in bis favour, as it was to him that it was eventually forwarded. In conversation with the Persian Minister this afternoon His Excellency admitted that this was probably the case. He said that Mirza Mehdi Khan on leaving Tehran had received general instructions for his guidance respecting t e Bahrein question, but that the details were settled at Shiraz and the Firman was issued m the name of the Persian Governor of Ears and not m that of the iffiiah. The name inserted in this document had certainly, he said, been altered once to his knowledge, and it was not unlikely that it had been changed a second time before being forwarded to its destination. “ With regard to the overtures said to have been made by Ali bin Khalifa to the Persian Government, as reported in my Despatch No. 81, I have the honour to state that that information also reached me Irom a private source and not from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. His Excellency has, however, asserted very positively to me to-day that Ali bin Khalifa had repeatedlv written to the Persian Government professing allegiance to the Shah and that a number of letters containing assurances of this kind aie now in bis (the Minister’s) possession. . “ appears to me that on the receipt ol a correspon dence which passed last April between Her Majesty’s Government and the Shahs representative in London, the Persian Ministers, believing that tlie Bahrein Chief was himself w 7 ell disposed to further their designs, resolved to take measures with a view to establishing, if possible, the Shah’s authority in that quarter and make good his claim to exercise sovereign rights over Bahrein. Mirza Mehdi Khan was accordingly dispatched to Shiraz and Bushire and a certain latitude was given to him as to the mode in which he should proceed to carry out the wishes of his Government. The Persian authorities in Shiraz finally determined that arnman should be addressed to Md. bin Abdullah, conferring27 JT''aA^&lt;7 'P- hlm , the f over “ m ent of Bahrein and with this the Khan hoped to be able to come to terms with the Chief then rn possession of the place. But in this matter the sole object of all concerned would seem to men e t oTV I ''f the P olic y° f the Persian Govern- , ' at Bahlein without reference to the interests or Q ~ S .' eS 0 ^ ' :r Majesty s Government in that quarter.” 95 On Sth April 1870 the Minister at Tehran addressed the following despatch to the Government of India • — “ With reference to my despatch of the 6 th instant, m which I stated that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed me that Ali bin Khalifa had repeatedly made overtures to Persia admitting his allegiance to the f'™’/. ha ™ the , honour to report to Your Excellency that Mirza bayed Khan has just sent to inform me that he was mistaken m making this assertion, and that he finds on enquiry that the letters to which he referred were not from that Chief, but from Md. bin Khalifa.” Hews of Government of India, May 1870. 96. The Government of India, commenting on these facts, remarked that Mehdi Khan appeared to have left Tehran with a general discretion as to which of the various Sheikhs should be recognised as ruler. “ At the capital no more definite plan appears to have been resolved on than that measures should be adopted to establish the SlretfekV- assumed right of sovereignty over the island.” 97. The Government of India proceeded that they had already pointed out that any disposition to admit the claims of Persia would probably lead to the revival of similar claims on the part of Turkey, a result which had in fact now been brought about (cp. paragraph 99 below). “ This (i.e. the Turkish) claim rests on no better foundation than that of Persia. It was summarily rejected by Lord Palmerston in 1851 and in our opinion should not again be reopened. With equal reason the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan of Muscat could claim the sovereignty of the island, if the nominal and temporary tender of allegiance, in times of difficulty, and as a security against foreign intervention, be considered sufficient ground on which to base such preten sions. On the same ground indeed we might claim Bahrein as a part of the British dominions. But, as we have repeatedly observed, the real status of the island, and the only one wffiich we have recognised and admitted, or are prepared to recognise and admit, in all our dealings in the Persian Gulf and our negotiations with the Chiefs, is that of an independent State, subject neither to Persia nor to ^ 2g Turkey, neither to the Wahabis nor to Muscat, nor yet to 0/20 5 1870. the British Government.” Review of Discussions of 1868-70. 98. The matter ultimately lapsed. But from the facts and the correspondence summarised above it will be seen, in the first place, that there appears to be no foundation for the alleged overtures to Persia by the ruling Sheikh, Ali bin Khalifa, or for the statement that the Persian flag was flying at the time of the punitive expedition of 1868 ; and that if any overtures were made to Persia in 1868-69 (and there is no confirmatory evidence of any such overtures) they would appear to have been made by the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa, presumably in his anxiety to secure Persian support for his restoration. Secondly, while the statements contained in the Note sent by the Foreign Office on behalf of Her Majesty s Government to the Persian Charge d’Affaires on 29th April 1869 were widely phrased, and afford some justification for the interpretation placed on them by Persia, and while the Persians may have been confirmed in their view by the absence of any protest by Her Majesty’s Minister against the mission of Mirza Mehdi Khan, the terms of that Note do/ 28 [Sheikhs Mel.

X.—1870-80. From the Turkish Occupation of Hasa to the First Exclusive Agreement. I'urkish Protest, 1870. 99. In January 1870 a protest was received from the Turkish Government against the recent actions of the F.O. to I.O., Resident at Bahrein. In reply the Turkish Government 11.1.1870, were informed that Her Majesty’s Government coula not T 31 T 7 cm recognise the Turkish claim to sovereignty over Bahrein; Lor. i, aui. a ^ d were courteoils i y reminded of the intimation made to them in 1851 on Lord Palmerston’s instructions (para graph 61 above). Turkish Occupation of Easa. British Assurances to Bahrein, 1871. 100 In 1871 the Turks occupied Hasa. Protests at Constantinople in April and May 1871 against rumoured Turkish designs on Bahrein resulted in a repudiation by Turkey of any such designs. The assurances received from the Turkish Government were communicated to the Sheikh of Bahrein, who had asked Her Majesty’s Government for their advice and their protection against the Burks m Lor. I, 902. Mav 1871, and he was informed that so long as he observed the provisions of the Convention of 1861 (paragraph 70 above) the reciprocal obligations towards him of Great Britain would be fulfilled. 101. Protests about the same time at Constantinople led to a Turkish repudiation of the designs which the Turkish Lor. I, 919. Government were alleged to have entertained at Bahrein, and the Turkish authorities in Hasa were given instructions by their Government which debarred them from approaching Bahrein. In May 1871 the Shah enquired from Her Majesty’s Representative at Tehran as to the probable effect on Bahrein of the Turkish occupation of Hasa and was informed in reply of the assurances which had been given to Her Majesty’s Government by the Turks. Reply to Persian Legation at Constantinople as to 'meaning of British Note of April 1869. 102. In November 1871 the Secretary of the Persian Legation at Constantinople made enquiries of Her Majesty’s Ambassador in connection with a rumour that a Turkish expedition was to be sent for the reduction of Bahrein, “ which island the Persian Secretary stated had been acknowledged by the British Government as a portion of Hertslet, 28. the Persian dominions and ... in proof of this assertion he had handed to Sir II. Elliott a copy of the note which C P- of L Lord Clarendon addressed to General Haji Mohsin Khan on 15°31372. 28th April 1869. Sir H.

Consequent on the murder of a Turkish messenger m Bahrein m August or September 1871, the Turkish Government demanded reparation direct from the Sheikh ™i Te TT d ^ n? nciliat r° ry re P ly - 0n their demand being p essed the Sheikh, on the advice of the Resident, suggested tha-t the matter be arranged between the British and the Vd F h° 1 ! er m rae 1 nt&amp; i’ Wh0se i oint decisi011 ^e would abide, but the lurkish Government preferred that it should be settled direct by the parties by agents. Her Maiesty’s Government saw no objection to such a procedure so long as no compulsion or show of force by Turkey was involved! Ihe Lurks, however, let the matter drop. The incident is o± some interest as illustrating the view taken bv Her Majesty s Government of the Sheikh as an independent ruler who might deal direct with foreign Powers. In August 1872, a further complaint having been received fiom Turkey of British proceedings in regard to Bahrein and the commission of “acts of sovereignty” on the part of the English, the Ambassador was informed in reply that enquiries would be made into the point raised by him and that his Government might rest assured that it was not the intention of Her Majesty’s Government to interfere in the affairs of the Persian Gulf beyond what was imposed upon them by treaty for the preservation of peace in the waters The Ambassador was finally informed in April 1873, after investigation, that there were no grounds what ever for the statement that the British Government had attempted to exercise acts of sovereignty over Bahrein. 105. _ In 1874, consequent on a Turkish claim to conscript Bahreinis resident in Basra, the Turkish Ambassador in London was referred to the British Notes of 1851 and 1870 (paragraphs 61 and 99 above), which stated that Her Majesty’s Government did not admit the claims of Turkey to consider Bahrein as part of the Ottoman dominions. In the same year, on a piratical attack being made on the island by certain Bahreini exiles who had signed a petition claiming Turkish protection, the Ambassador at Constan tinople handed a memorandum to the Porte in which it was stated that Her Majesty’s Government could not recognise any rights or pretensions of the Porte over Bahrein. In 1875 a rumour that Her Majesty’s Government were forti fying Llahrein led to representations from Turkey. The Lor - h 914- rumour was unfounded and the Turks were so informed. On its becoming known about the same time that the Turks Lor - h 915. themselves contemplated building a lighthouse on the island, the British Government entered a protest at Constantinople (October 1875), with the result that the project was abandoned. 106. In 1876, consequent on steps taken by the Turkish authorities to enforce the claims of Qatar merchants against Bahreinis, a Note was addressed to the Porte reminding them of the determination of Her Majesty’s Government to protect Bahrein against any attack on its independence. 107. In 1879-80 the Turkish Government took up the cause of the rebels of 1869. Her Majesty’s Government, after again disclaiming the exercise of sovereignty over Lor. 1,915.

In the same year the Porte was informed, with reference to a rumoured intention to land Turkish troops, that such action would be opposed by Her Majesty’s ships. Summary, 1880-92. 116. The Turkish claim was again pressed vigorously during this period and was consistently rejected by Her Majesty’s Government.

The views of Her Majesty’s Government on the status of the island were again officially repeated at Constantinople on two occasions in 1896. In 1897 the Constantinople Board of Health proposed to establish a sanitary post in Bahrein. The proposal was abandoned on the objections of the British delegate, who represented that Bahrein was an independent principality under British protection. 118, In 1898 a Turkish request that a British \ 7 ice- Consul alleged to have been appointed at Bahrein should32 Lor.

An official protes was at once made by His Majesty’s Minister to the Permn Government, in the course oi which S 1 ^ A.

The Disorders of 1904-05. 121. In 1904-05, consequent on a series of^ attacks on Persians and on German subjects in Bahrein, the Persians appealed to the Shah. The Persian Government replied that His Majesty’s Government would take action on their Denali. The text of their telegram was as follows : “ To the Merchants and Traders of the High Government living m Bahrein. Your telegram on the subject of the assaults which nave been made upon yon by the Arab roughs of Bahrein has been received. Certainly let your minds be at rest. Con sultations wdth the English Legation have taken place on this subject, and it will shortly be settled in such a way that the oppression will be removed and that the offenders Will receive their proper punishment. 122. The Germans complained to the German Vice- Consul at Bushire, who made a direct request to the Sheikh for reparation, in reply to which he was refeiied by Hi» Excellency to His Majesty’s Government, The Sheikh was ultimately compelled by His Majesty’s Government to give redress. Turkish Protest, 1904-05. 1 v&gt;.‘i On the Turks pressing in 1904-05 for an explanation of the action taken by His Majesty’s Government in connectionwith the ill-treatment of the German subject, the Turkish Ambassador was informed by Lord Lansdowne that it was a mattei of common knowledge and well known to the Turkish Government that His Majesty’s Government had direct relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein; that the island and its natives were under British protection; and that His Majesty s Government were within their rights in taking measures to obtain redress for the outrage committed there. On the Ambassador reverting to the subject later in 1905, he was informed (20th May 1905) that His Majesty’s Government must decline to entertain any further represen tations from the Turkish Government on the subject. Reassertions of Persian Claim, 1905-13. ^ 1 , 24 h I 11 , the Persians a g ain reasserted their claim. On the 19tn February 1906, in reply to a further reiteration which appears to have been based on the treaties of 1809, lbl-1 and 1 b5 1 , tne Minister at Tehran informed the Persian Government that “The Treaties of JS09, of 1814 and of Ibo i on this subject have always been scrupulously observed by His Majesty s Government, but have no bearing on the present question. His Majesty’s Government have never admitted the ownership or sovereignty of Persia over Bahiein. buck, a claim is in their view entirely inadmissible. His Majesty’s Government consider the island of Bahrein and its inhabitants to he under British protection, and must decline to entertain any^ further representations on the subject, I am further to mention that this reply has invariably been made to the Ottoman Government, who have on several occasions advanced a claim to Bahrein.” The Note concluded by a reference to the Persian appeal for our assistance in 1904—05 and quoted in extenso the telegram of reassurance (paragraph 121 above) to the Persian inhabitants of Bahrein then sent on behalf of the Persian Government. 125. On 13th September 1906 the Persian Grand Vizier revived the Persian claim in a letter referring to Captain Bruce’s unauthorised agreement of 1822. He was reminded in reply that that agreement had been expressly disavowed by His Majesty’s Government and that Captain Bruce had been recalled. In a supplementary note the Grand Vizier’s attention was drawn to the fact that the then Shah himself had “ refused to recognise ” the stipulations of the Treaty of 1822. which had never been ratified, and had “expressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz should have entered into any^ engagements with the British Government without his knowledge or instructions.” 126. On the Ala-es-Sultaneh reviving the Persian claim, on the ground of the Agreement of 1822, in August 1907, his attention was drawn in a Note dated 13th August 1907 to the Notes referred to in the preceding paragraph; and to the fact that the Agreement had been disavowed alike by His Majesty’s Government and by the Shah. The Note added that “ since 1822 the Turkish Government have raised claims on Bahrein, and, like the Persian Govern ment, have been informed that Bahrein is under British protection.” 127. In 1908 the Persian Government, in a correspondence regarding the punishment of a Bahrein subject at Lingak, intimated that instructions had been sent to Lingah that reparation should be made, but added that His Majesty’s Minister would admit that “ the proprietary right of the Persian Government over the island is not a matter to be disputed.” The Note was returned as inadmissible to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A modified version was sub sequently accepted by His Majesty’s Government, which was acknowledged by a Note from His Majesty’s Minister, F.O. to Con stantinople, No. 59 of 22.2.1905. 19.2.1906. Teh.

In July of the same yea/ it was reported that internal Persian coastal passes issued to persons proceeding to Bahrein from 1 ersian ports were vis4 by a Persian merchant resit mg in ^ a _ • In 1912 the individual in question was forbidden to take any action in regard to the endorsement of passes held by P.Gr. 13: 67, Persian subjects for travelling m Bahrein. 1 he ©ndorse- § 24 ments in question were, however, henceforth granted by the Political Resident—a practice, as pointed out by the 1 optical Resident nine years later, “ of itself open to objection, as it might be construed into a tacit admission that the I ersian passport authorities are justified in giving passes .or anothei Persian port to persons going to Bahrein. Withdrawal of Turkish Claim to Bahrein in Anglo Turkish Convention of 29th July 1913. 129 On 29th July 1913 His Majesty’s Government signed a convention (which still awaited ratification on the outbreak of the War of 1914-18) with the Ottoman Govern ment. under which that Government renounced all their claims to the islands of Bahrein, the independence of which they recognised. His Majesty’s Government on their part declared that they had no intention of annexing the islands and undertook not to allow the Sheikh of Bahrein to disturb the autonomy of the peninsula of El Katr or to annex it, and to ensure that the Sheikh should not discriminate against Ottoman subjects in the matter of dues levied upon pearl fisheries. The Turkish Government on their side accepted a reservation of the right of the population ol Bahrein to visit Zakhnuniyah Island for fishing, and recognised the rights of subjects of the Sheikh to British consular protection in Turkey. This arrangement, i« ll °wed, as it was bv the disappearance of Turkey from the GuT after the War of 1914-18, disposed of the Turkish claim to Bahrein, which had been reasserted on numerous occasions and with great insistence since 1847. Summary, 1892-1913. 130. The Turkish claim was repeatedly raised during the early part of this period, but consistently opposed by His Majesty’s Government. It was finally abandoned in the (unratified) Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 1913. While that Convention was never ratified, the abandonment of the Turkish claim was confirmed by Article 16 of the Treaty of Lansaune of 1923. The Persian claim was also frequently pressed and was consistently repudiated in strong terms by His Majesty s Government. XIII.—1913-34.

In 1915 His Majesty’s Government, in entering into an Agreement with Ibn Baud, then ruler of Nek? i ltc !l- XT - secured an undertaking from him “ to refrain from all fc 6 - 8 . aggression on, or interference with the territories of -Bahrein. . . Persian Claim reasserted, 1922-23. 134 In 1922 His Majesty’s Consul at Bunder Abbas reported that the Persian passport officials at Lingah had ruled that Bahreinis were Persian subjects and should be given Persian passports. They seized two British certificates of identity granted to Bahrein subjects, but on representa tions being made by the Minister at Tehran instructions were given by the Central Government that there was to be no repetition of this incident. In 1922, also, the Persian delegate at a Postal Conference held at Bushire stated that o«’ while not for the moment pressing for the transfer to Persia ’ S of the Bahrein post office, his action was without prejudice to the Persian claim to Bahrein. 135. In 1923, consequent on a Press campaign and a discussion in the Majliss on the desirability of giving Bahrein the right to return a member to the Persian Parlia ment, which was referred to a Commission for report, His Majesty’s Government decided that it was desirable to address a formal Note to the Persian Government in terms similar to those employed in 1906 (paragraph 124 above). Owing to the difficult internal situation in Persia this proposal was dropped, but in September 1923 the Persian 13 g Government was informed that the island was now a British 9 ’ ^ protectorate, and that His Majesty’s Government did not contemplate any alteration of its status. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that the Government of which he was a member had no intention of laying claim to Bahrein on behalf of Persia. But despite this statement the Minister for Foreign Affairs again reverted to the question in the following month. His Majesty s Government remove Sheikh Isa for Misgovernment (1923). 136. Consequent on the gross misgovernment of Sheikh Isa, who had been ruler of Bahrein since 1869, the Sheikh was deprived by His Majesty’s Government of his control of affairs in Bahrein on 26th May 1923, and was granted an p ^ allowance, his son, Sheikh Hamad (whose right of succession had been recognised by His Majesty’s Government in .1901) §§ 11-14 being appointed to act for him “ as his father’s fully empowered agent.” Oil concession granted by Sheikh, 1925. 137. In 1925 an oil concession was granted by the Sheikh of Bahrein to the Eastern and General Syndicate, a British corporation, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government. ilA itch., XT, No. vii, 227-9. 26.11.1927.

Attitude of Sheikhs to Persian claim (1928). 139. The Sheikhs of Bahrein, on being apprised of the revival of Persia’s claim, gave a letter to the i olitica Resident, requesting His Majesty’s Government m accordance P. 1409/28. with their treaties “ to defend 7* a r l r °“ in 0 ' ferenee ’’ and to act as their agents m rebutting the I eisian chims and intimating that the Sheikhs proposed to send Sheikh Mohamed, brother of Sheikh Hamad, the uepnty ruler and son of the deposed ruler, Isa, as their representative in answering the claim should the case be taken to Geneva. Further Persian Protest, 2nd August 1928. 140. On the 2nd August 1928 the Persian Government pomimmicated a lengthy and reasoned reply to the biitisn Note of 18th January 1928. The Note based its reiteration of the Persian claim on the principle that terntoiy belonging to a sovereign State could definitely be detached ^rom that State only with the consent of the State m question, ^Tich hac not been given in the case of Bahrein ; and alleged that the terms O? the Foreign Office Note of 29th April 1869 were con- elusive evidence of the view then held of the rights 01 Persia by His Majesty’s Government; that Banrem had consistently recognised Persian sovereignty, as could be proved by documentarv evidence, up to the date when the Sheik is weie instigated to rebellion by a foreign government; that no valid argument could be founded on the direct relations into which the Sheikhs had entered with His Majesty s Govern ment since their action had been without the approval ot their’suzerain; that the relations of Bahrein with 1 ersia were more highly developed than with any othci independent civilised country; that the Persian claim had been con sistently and uninterruptedly pressed ; and finally that even if the Treaty of 1822 was disavowed by Hip Majesty s Government, it was material evidence of the view held by a British officer of great experience at the time of its con clusion, and that its disavowal by the then Shah of 1 ersia was not because of any doubt on his part as to the true status of Bahrein. . j ^ -wh 141.

Discussions between His Majesty’s Government and Persia 1928-34. 143 Between 1928 and 1934 treaty negotiations, with a view to the conclusion of a general treatv which should dispose of outstanding points of difference, were in progress wutn 1 ersia, the question of Bahrein figuring prominently in those negotiations. The general attitude taken by the 1 ersians was that Bahrein was a point of great importance to them, but that m return for a sufficient quid pro quo they would be prepared to abandon their claims. His Majesty’s Government on their side consistently maintained that the Persian claim was worthless, and that while they would gladly see it finally oisposed of as part of a general settlement, they would not .be prepared to make any specific concession in return for its abandonment. \ aricus formulae w r ere worked out in discussion between His Majesty’s Pepresentatives in 1 ehran and the representatives of the Persian Government wdth a view.to an agreed solution. The negotiations have, however, failed to reach any conclusion and are at the moment suspended without any prospect of early resumption. .144. In 1932 the Persian Government protested to His P Z. 4902/33 Majesty’s Government against the issue of British Indian postage stamps surcharged “ Bahrein,” and repeated their protest to the League. Their protest was rejected by His Majesty’s Government, and the stamps issued in August 1933. On 22nd May 1934 a further protest against the operation of the Bahrein oil concession was addressed by P.Z. 4343/34 the Persian Government to the United States Minister at Tehran, the United States Government and His Majesty’s Government, and copies were circulated at the request of Persia to the League of Nations. His Majesty’s Government propose to reply to this communication in a Note drawing attention to their Notes of January 1928 and February 1929 and to request the League of Nations to circulate this reply to the States Members of the League. XIV.—Conclusion. 145. It may be convenient in concluding this memoran dum on the recent history of Bahrein to summarise very briefly the claims to sovereignty over the island which have been advanced by various countries since 1783 ; the particular basis of those claims in the case of Persia (wdiose claim is alone at the present time of any importance); and the basis and development of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government.

The claims of the Amirs disappeared with the conquest of Hasa by Turkey m 1. f Ji Turkeu —The islands have never in the period subse- 17 J occupied by Turkey or (if the incidents Turkish sovereignty. — 'V 7 1Q - , 107 A iqta «« ik the British Government. The Turkish claim was finally withdrawn in the Anglo-Turk.sh Convention of 1J13. That Convention was never ratified, but the withdrawal of the claim was confirmed by Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923. ^ . (e) Persia —The Persian claim has been consistently uro-ed on F variety of occasions through the period m question. The Sheikhs momentarily submitted themselves to Persia in 1799 and paid tribute In 1810-1 &lt; they received a Persian envoy and apparently appealed lor help to Tehran They aqain momentarily submitted to 1 ersia and received an envoy in 1839. Persian aid was invoked and a Persian emissary received at Bahrein in 18 &gt;0 hi. while in 1869 the deposed ex-Sheikh Mohammed bm Khalifa may have made overtures to Persia (though there is no confirmation of this) to enable him to re-establish ins control over the island. , . , 1 The Persian claim appears, apart from ^is, to have been asserted in 1822, 1825, 184-1, 1848, 1861, 18b2, 1866, 1868, 1869,1886, 1901, 1905, 1906, 1907, 1940, 1927, 1928, 1-930, 1932-33 and 1934, and to have been rejected by ins Maiestv’s Government in 1822 (as part of theii relusal to accept Captain BruceVLreaty), 1825, 1844,1818, 1861,1862 1866-67, 1869, 1901,1906, 1907, 1908-09, 1923, 1928, 1929, 1933 and 1934. B*—Basis of the Persian Claim, 147. Ignoring contentions such as that the use of the term « Persian^Gulf ’’ is a recognition of Persian sovereignty over the various islands of the Gulf, Persia has at one time or other based her claim on the nine grounds examined below (1) History of the Islands prior to 1783. The history of the islands prior to the expulsion of the Persians in 1783 is dealt with in paragraphs 3 to 5 above. It will be seen that at various periods since the beginning of the Christian era, Persia has exercised a degree of control over the islands, and in particular that during the 30 years prior to 1783 her control was of a more definite character. On the other hand, the facts recorded above do not support any claim by Persia to an uninterrupted occupation or control lolcmrlQ39 417 e the ^rly hSorv oTT!' Ul tIle P ast ^PPealed to •f • ? 7 ^oiyo* Bahrein m support of her claim thnt Wr!- illSt0riCa 7 1 ersiau teiTitor y* Since 1930, too certain eisian newspapers, presumably inspired, have dealt at considerable length wUh the history of Bahrein in the more by QuotXn Iro *’ ha 7 e SUpP ° rted their atatements ceo&lt;hhhe s or 1 LI™’• ° 1 ' ’ n ereUCes ^ 0 &gt; Aral) or Persian &amp; eo rapheis 01 historians. Owing to the absence of records and the shortness of time available, it has been impossible o check these statements in detail, or to conduct elaborate from wbhlil ih 6 'O' DgS ° f Arab , geographers and others i i It fa t ! ler mf 9 r . ma fion might be secured. But it is arguable that the position of the islands prior to 1783 is at most only of very indirect importance in the present connection. I he essential weakness in the Persian 1 claim is it is suggested, that there has been no effective exercise of authority m the islands by Persia since her expulsion m li83, and that the Sheikhs, who originally established themselves by conquest, have now acquired a prescriptive title based on an uninterrupted occupation of ibO years by the present ruling family. (2) The Absence of Persian Consent to the Detachment of Bahrein from Persia. I he I eisian G overnment, in paragraph 2 of their Note of 2nd August 1928 (Appendix B), invited attention to ‘tne following international juridical principle. ... A territory belonging to a sovereign State cannot be lawfully detached so long as the right of ownership has not been transferred by this State to another State in virtue of an official act, m this case a treaty, or so long as its annexation by another State or its independence have not been officially recognised by the lawful owner of the territory.” They added (correctly) that Persia has never renounced her sovereignty or ceded it to another State or ever recognised any of the Sheikhs of Bahrein as independent rulers. I he argument put forward by the Persian Government under this head is examined in detail in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Note despatched by the Foreign Office on 18th February 1929 in reply to the Persian Note of 2nd August 1928 (Appendix B). His Majesty’ s G overn- ment expressed their inability to agree that any such principle, if alleged to be of universal application, formed part of international law. The deciding factor in the question of international title in cases in which territory has effectively established its independence of the former sovereign is the effective establishment by that territory of its independence, “and in the case of Bahrein His Majesty’s Government regard as wholly untenable the pro position that effective possession and administration by the present ruling family for 145 years, during which these rulers have been independent of Persia and during which no Persian authority has been exercised in their dominions, can be affected by the mere consideration that the Persian Government have not set their signature to a document formally recognising the fact of their independence.” In paragraph 7 of the same Note His Majesty’s Government cite historical precedents to show that the theory of the necessity for the formal consent of the dispossessed State is not one which has ever obtained international acceptance. (3) The Unratified Treaty of 1^22. The circumstances in which the Treaty of 1822 was concluded b} r Captain Bruce with the representative of the Prince Governor of Shiraz are set out in paragraphs 20-21 above. As will he seen, Captain Bruce concluded it withouttV authority o£ or reference to Government. The treaty Sto which L had entered was immediately official y dis- “ d nnrl the Persian Government so informed, and avowed, and the imsia ^ a . sapproral of his actioni was removed from’his appointment. The Persian Government on their side equally disapproved the action of the I mice Governor of Pars in entering into any treaty discussion, without the prior approval of the fehah [Hie leisia Government were reminded of this m Id-o, 1 c4j, , 1907 1928 and 1929.] It appears impossible in these circum stances to base any legitimate claim to I ersian sovereign y over Bahrein on the provisions of the lieaty ot 18— (4) The Gold Coin alleged to have been struck at Bahrein in 1817. Please see paragraph 47 above. . . , ^ • A Persian Mission appears to have visited baniein in 1816 or 1817 (paragraph 9 above) and it is conceiva he tna a coin might have been struck on that occasion On the other hand, it would probably be extremely difficult to prove that the coin had not in fact been struck el sew mre, though with an indication that it had been minted at Bahrein The incident is in itself of relatively small importance, and it would, it is suggested, be^ impossible for Persia to use such an incident, even, if it could be proved, save in support of arguments of much more sub- cic» nal pliarfi eter. (5) Payment of Peeshkesh, Offerings or Tribute at various Stages by Bahrein to Persia. From paragraph 6 above it will be seen that tribute appears to have been paid by Bahrein to Persia in 1799. The rulers of Bahrein may also have ottered to pay tribute in 1839 (paragraph 32) and appear to have offered to do so in 1860 (paragraph 67), In assessing the importance of the payment of tribute in 1799, or, if it then took place, in 1839 or 1860, It is relevant that such payment or promise of payment was immediately followed by the submission of the rulers of Bahrein, in 1800 to Muscat, in 1839 to the Egyptians, and in I860 t 0 the Turks. In estimating the importance of such payments as evidence of a recognition of 1 ersian snzeiaint}, the arguments advanced by Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran in his Despatch No. 28 of March 1845, in which Colonel Shed remarks that the Chiefs of Bahrein “ had in all probability from time to time given peeshkesh, offerings, or tribute to Persia as a mark of superiority, as Kandahar and Herat still continue to do, without an acknowledgment of subjection and the comment thereon of the Secret Com mittee of the East India Company that “presents and complimentary messages do not imply an acknowledgment of sovereignty, and they have not been confined to Persia ’ are also relevant. (6) Flying of the Persian Flag by the Sheikh of Bahrein. (a) The Persian flag was hoisted by the Sheikh of Bahrein in 1860. But as will he seen from paragraph 67 above, hardly had it been hoisted when, on the arrival of a Turkish emissary, it was lowered and the Turkish flag hoisted in its place. At a later stage in 1860-61 the Persian and Turkish flags were apparently flown side by side by the Sheikh. It appears difficult in these circumstances to base any substantial argument on the incident. * (b) The Notes addressed by the Persian envoy in London to the Foreign Office in February 1869 alleged that the Persian flag had been hoisted by Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah and that the Resident had in September 1868 bombarded thebheikh s palace on which the flan- was flvino- Th*™ to be no foundation for the siwiestionhlt tbo P fPP® ars was flyl n g When the ResidenrSedBltei^or Sh waf the time of e the a R gr, H Pl1 ^ P reviousl y hoisted it had, by (c Tn tbp h ^ t . ld , en , t 8 arr, T al &gt; beel1 hauled down. ( J In the undated letters from Sheikh Md bin Khalifab ApriT h 1 F ° rei ^ P ffice ^ P-sian envoy in Apul 186J, the Sheikh stated that he was hoisting the fW of the Lion and Sun over Bahrein. [f, as seems nrobfh?. from internal evidence, these letters date from the period of the abortive Persian Mission to Bahrein of 1860MU it is le evant in assessing their importance that immediately after the reception of the Persian envoy, a TuS envoy was leceived the Persian Sag hauled down and the Turkish of Pereia and &lt; ^ aa i “ the T' ly part ° f 1861 the fla S s of Persia and mirkey appear to have been flyincr side bv e'ithTflao fl°e' tS , T here is nothin/to show thal either hag flew in Bahrein between the conclusion of tbn Convention of 1861 (paragraph 70) and 1868. (d) In September 1869 the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifab attacked the islands and with the assistance of Sheikh Md bin Abdulla killed the ruling Sheikh Ali. The Persian flao^ may have been hoisted on this occasion. But there 's no reference to this in the detailed reports of the capture of the is ands by Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah and Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah, or of the operations as the result of which those Sheikhs were reduced at the end of 1869. (Enclosure to Government of India’s Despatch No. 7 of 25th January 1870 • Resident s Despatches of 11th September, 25th September' and 5th October 1869.) September, (7) Letters from past Rulers of Bahrein admitting Persian Suzerainty. It is by no means improbable that in 1799, 1816-17 and .1839 the rulers of Bahrein addressed letters to the -Persian Government acknowledging Persian suzerainty over tqLi o' ? n( ^ ltiey a PP ear certainly to have done so in 1860. But the only letters the text of which has ever been communicated to Her Majesty’s Government are the two letters communicated by the Persian envoy in London in 1869 Those _ letters indeed categorically acknowledge Persian suzeiainty ovei Bahrein, and state that it has been uninter ruptedly exercised in the past. But they appear to date from 1860, and the submission of Bahrein to Turkey and the hauling down of the Persian flag in the same year are, it is suggested, material in assessing the weight to be attached to them. (8) Declarations made by tier Majesty’s Government to the Persian Minister in London, April 1869. (a) 'These declarations are examined in paragraph 98 above. The text of the Note addressed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Persian envoy on 29th April 1869, on which the subsequent Persian claims have to a considerable extent been based, is given in paragraph 85 above. The wording of that Note, and the general attitude adopted by Her Majesty’s Government, as evidenced by their acquiescence in the despatch of a mission to Bahrein by Persia, undoubtedly afforded Persia justification for the inferences she appears to have drawn. But, as pointed out in paragraph 10 of the Note addressed to the Persian Minister on 18th February 1929 and reproduced in Appendix B, the Note in question, while very loosely expressed, was 295342 graphs 10- arid n ^ ^ past b y Her Majesty s consideration t ad ^een g ^ u v did ^ot i n an y way ^TS that claim was valid. The Note, indeed con- admit tii ^ ^ + 1 -.^ P»ritish Government to continue no more ll J an f a t ^°' r aesfre'to^pay the 7 fullest possible attention ^any Persian claims. It^iU be observed that the first and apparently the only) communication made to the Pprqian Government m discharge of this unaerstanau g, intimated to that Government the intention rf Her Majesty s Government to proceed at once against the - Met now m nossession of Bahrein ” consequent on his breach of the maritime peace and his attack on the Sheikh who bad been placed in power at Bahrein by the British Government. (9) Closeness of Relations at the present Day between The Sheikhs of Bahrein are strongly °PP° 8e l] to recognition of Persian suzerainty (cp. paragraph ]o9). ihe Persian suggestion that relations are at the present time closer between Persia and Bahrein than between Lahiem and any other independent civilised State is without founda tion. Relations are at least equally close with Saudi A, abia, and the closest relations are maintained m addition with Great Britain and with British India. The Terms of the Treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 between the British Government and Persia. 148. In addition to the nine arguments examined above, Persia has on more than one occasion appealed to the provisions of her treaties of 1809, 1814 and 18o7 mth txie British Government in connection with her claim to Bahrein Her appeal is based substantially on the fact that those treaties provide in certain circumstances for the evacuation of Persian territory occupied by British troops. The relevant passages of the treaties are as follows A itch XIII (i) By the preliminary Treaty of 1809 between His Xo wfs. ’ Maiestv’s Government and Persia, the Persian Government undertook not to “permit any European force whatever to pass through Persia either towards India or towards the ports of that country”; while His Majesty’s Government undertook “ in case any European forces have invaded or shall invade the territories of His Majesty the. King ot Persia” to “ afford to His Majesty the King of Persia a force, or in lieu of it a subsidy, with warlike ammunition . . . Article 5 of the same treaty provided ; “ H a detachment of British troops has arrived from India in the Gulf of Persia and, by the consent of His Persian Majesty, landed on the island of Karak or any of the Persian ports, they shall not in anv manner possess themselves of such places, and from the date of these preliminary articles the said detachment shall43 419 amount of wUcHhalf 5‘setten the dffinftife ^’” tbe treated in a friendly manner by the Governor and arnmJf prices.

British forces at the times envisaged by the treaty provisions to which appeal is made by Persia, there might be some force in the Persian argument, though even then His Majesty’s Government might claim that the fact that their actual relations with Bahrein had in no way been affected by the provisions of those treaties, and that Persia had made no protest at the time against any failure to implement those provisions clearly showed that Persia had accepted in the past the fact that Bahrein fell outside her territorial limits. In fact, neither in 1809, 1814 nor in 1857 was there any British occupation of Bahrein; while His Majesty’s Government, never having admitted Persian sovereignty over Bahrein or regarded Bahrein as an integral part of Persia, have in the past adopted the attitude that the terms of the treaties referred to above are irrelevant for the present purpose. As stated by His Majesty’s Government in 1900 in reply to a Persian Note which based the Persian claim upon the provisions of those treaties, “ the treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 on this subject have always been scrupulously observed by His Majesty’s Government, but have no bearing on the present question.

Persia, in other words was up to 1913 one only of the claimants to Bahrein, and through much of the period 1817 to 1913 if anything a less insistent and some extent a less plausible claimant than lur.cej. 150 These considerations, however, apart, the genera effect of a review of the history of Bahrein over the last IfiO years and of an examination of the specific arguments III forward by Persia and referred to m paragraphs U7-8 above is to suggest that there is no solid basis a p erma claim to suzerainty or sovereignty over the islands, l owiirranhical remoteness of the islands from Persia and fhe'faJt that their population is Arab are admittedly not decisive arguments. The real weakness in the Persian claim appears to be that there has been no effective exercise of Persian authority in the islands since the expulsion of leisia by the ancestors of the present ruling house in 1,83. buch incidents as the momentary hoisting of the 1 ersian flag 1860, its flying side by side with the Turkish flag m ISbCMH, or the temporary tender of allegiance to Leisia m i.' , 1816-17 and 1839 must be considered in relation to the history of the islands as a whole, in the period now under consideration, and in particular to the consistent claim of Turkey between 1847 and 1913 and to the absence oi any sequel to such momentary acknowledgment of 01 appeals to Persian power; and they cannot carry the weight of a long dealing extending over a course oi years _ I he remarks of the Government of India in 1870, quoted m paragraph 9/ above are relevant in this connection, as are the observa tions 'in paragraph 8 of the British hote to _ ersia o 18th February 1929. It may be added, too, that during the period from 1/88 Bahrein has at various dates been m a position to enter into treaty engagements or discussions with neighbouring fetateb such’as Muscat (paragraph 26), Turkey (paragraph 103), the Egyptian Viceroy, Mehemet Ah (paragraph o4) and His Maiesty’s Government on a basis inconsistent w ith hei being at the time subject to_Persian jurisdiction. A further point of some importance is the absence, so far as available records show, of any reference to Persia by the Sheikhs of Bahrein, at any date since the conquest of Bahrein by the ancestors of the present rulers in 1783, on the occasion ol45 their accession, or of any formal acknowledgment by Bahrein on such occasions of sovereignty or suzerainty such as might be expected from a Sheikh who regarded himself as a vassal oi 1 ersia Is or does any protest at the absence of any such ormal acknowledgment appear at any time to have been made by Persia. 151. The correspondence of 1869-70, to which particular attention has been paid by Persia in the past, and which mav be thought the strongest contention that Persia is in a position to put forward, may indeed be quoted as evidence of the view taken by Her Majesty’s Government at that period o± the ielation of Persia to Bahrein. But it cannot be valid as against the Sheikhs, and while it is sufficiently looselv expressed to afford some justification for the construction which has been placed on it by Persia, it is relevant that the construction placed on it by Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, and supported by the Government of India, passed without challenge in 1871 (paragraph 102) ; that, a similar interpretation was placed on it, with a minimum of preliminary discussion, in 1886 (paragraph 110); that at ^ frequent intervals between 1870 and 1880 His Majesty’s Government maintained the independence of Bahrein against Turkey (paragraphs 99-107 above) ; that so early as January 1870 they drew the attention of the Turkish Government to the British Note of 1851 (para graph 61 above); and that His Majesty’s Government have uninterruptedly maintained the independence of Bahrein against Persia and Turkey alike since the date of the correspondence in question. 152. The Sheikhs themselves appear, particularly in the early part of the past century, before their relations with Her Majesty’s Government were placed on a more definite footing by the Agreements of 1880 and 1892, to have been guided by a consideration of their own immediate interests in deciding on the line of policy to be adopted towards the stronger rulers by whom the} 7 were surrounded. But not only is it now almost three-quarters of a centur} 7 since any appeal, however flimsy, appears to have been made to Persia by Bahrein, but the present Sheikh (like his predecessor) is keenly apprehensive of any recognition of the Persian claim, to which he is most strongly opposed. C.—Attitude of British Government, 1820-1934. 153. From 1820 onwards His Majesty’s Government consistently dealt with the Sheikhs as independent rulers. They concluded treaties with them on that basis in 1820, 1847, 1861, 1868, 1880 and 1892, and they have been prepared to maintain their independence by diplomatic, or on occasion by forcible methods against challenge from outside, whether from Persia, Turkey, Fgypt or the Wahabis. They originally entered into relations with the Sheikhs and promised them a measure of protection (para graph 16) in the interests of securing the peace of the Persian Gulf. In the early stages of those relations they appear to have been solely concerned to achieve this object (in 1820 they even offered their mediation, which was, however, not accepted by Persia, to secure the payment of tribute to Persia by the Sheikhs), and they restricted their inter ference with the internal affairs of the Sheikhdom to the minimum required to secure the interests of British subjects. They w r ere consistently reluctant to establish a protectorate over Bahrein in view of the probable local embarrassments in regulating the succession, &amp;c., in which this might 2953 Minvolve them, and in 1849 they formally declined a request l,s- the Sheikh that he and the islands should be daken under British protection. In 1861 (paragraph iO) th ,, gave the Sheikhs more categorical guarantees ol protection in return for more binding undertakings I heir corre spondence with the Persian Minister m London m I 8 W -0 » shows the Home Government, however, st]13 ready at that date to adopt the attitude that if any other lower would discharge the objects which had led Great Britain to undertake certain responsibilities in relation to Bahrein, she would gladly see~ them do so. Closer relations with the Sheikh and closer control over his freedorn ot action were established for the first time by the Exclusive Agree ment of 1880. Relations became closer stijl with the conclusion of the Exclusive Agreement of 189 l. bince that date the position of Bahrein, though His Majesty s Government make no claim to sovereignty, though the Sheikhdom continues to be regarded as independent Rom the international standpoint, and though the Sheikhs enjoy a very large measure of internal autonomy, has tended increasingly to approximate to that of a State under British protection. .

On the conti ary, m whole tenor of the note should'have made it clear that Her Majesty’s Government mMutainfd their ri^ht to enter into direct treaty relations with the Sheikhs of Bahrein as independent rulers; and while at the same time it indicated that Her Maiesty’s Government would gladly transfer to Persia, if she were able and wit fno- to perform them, certain duties in the Persian Gulf towards the performance*of which the treaty relations in question contributed, and offered, v ; ew 0 f the friendly feelings entertained by Her Majesty s Government towards Persia! to cause the Persian Government to be informed beforehand, when practicable, of any measure of coercion which the conduct oi the sheikhs have rendered necessary, it is evident that no recognition ot Jie validity of the Persian protest or of the Persian claim to suzerainty, was thereby intended or implied * The note, in fact, as the Persian Legation at Constantinople was reminded in December 1871 by Sir Henry Elliott, then Her Majesty s Ambassador in Turkey contains nothing more than an acknowledgment that the Persian claim to suzerainty had previously been made. The numerous supplementary agree ments entered into between the British Government and the rulers of Bahrein between 1869 and the present day have equally proceeded on the assumption that a claim to sovereignty in Bahrein on the part either V?, 1 * 1 ® Shah' or of the Turkish Government could not possibly be admitted by His Maiestv’s Government. . . . ,- n 1 r. ‘ The attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards this question was still more clearly defined when in the year 1906 His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, on mv predecessor’s instructions, addressed to the Persian Government a note stating tb* t “ His Maiesty’s Government have never admitted the ownership or sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein, and such a claim is in their view, entirely inadmissible.

From the foregoing remarks you will observe that the Persian Govern ment are not justified in supposing that His Majesty’s Government, either in 1869 or at any other time, intended to recognise that Bahrein was a part of Persia and that, while they have, indeed admitted that a claim on the subject has from’time to time been put forward by the Persian Government, they have never admitted the validity of the claims which either the Turkish or Persian Governments have frequently put forward in the past. Their consistent endeavour in the matter of Bahrein has been to secure that the peaceful development of the islands and the welfare of the Arab inhabitants shall not be disturbed by unjustified attempts on the part of their neighbours to subject them to a foreign domination Thev are not prepared to contemplate any departure from this policy.

G°^_ ein iiient to the islands of Bahrein, that His Majesty’s Government in the l nited Kingdom were not aware of any valid grounds upon which the claim of tne Persian Government to sovereignty over those islands was or could be based, borne months later, on the 2nd August, 1928, the Persian Acting Minister for roreign Affairs addressed to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran a further note explaining in detail the reasons which have led his Government to consider themselves justified in advancing such a claim. I now have the honour to request that you will convey to your Government the following reply :•— 2. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have examined with the greatest care the views set forth in the Persian Government’s note of the 2nd August, and have endeavoured to extract from the many unsupported declarations that Bahrein forms an integral part of Persia (a statement which, as I have already indicated in my note under reference, bears no relation to geographical facts), the essential arguments on which this claim is based. They note that the Persian Government do not in any way base their claim on the alleged recognition of their rights in the past by His Majesty’s Government. So far as can be deduced from their note under reply, their claim is, in fact, founded on three main arguments : Firstly, on uninterrupted possession except for the period of Portuguese occupation between 1507 and 1622; secondly, on an alleged principle of international law that a territory belonging to a sovereign State cannot be lawfully detached so long as its annexation by another State or its independence have not been officially recognised by the lawful owner of the territory • and thirdly, on documents of a date later than the end of the 18th century, in which the sheikhs of the islands are alleged to have declared their submission to the Persian Government, and on the alleged payment by them of tribute to the Persian Government. After full examination of these arguments His Majesty’s Government have reached the conclusion, for the reasons given below, that they entirely fail to substantiate a Persian claim to sovereignty over the islands at the present day. 3. In the first place, the statement that £C Bahrein has always and uninterruptedly formed part of Persia in past centuries, except during the Portuguese occupation from 1507 to 1622 ” is not one which can be allowed to pass unquestioned. I have already drawn attention to the evident fact that geographically this assertion is misleading. Historically it is almost equally misleading. The earlier history of the islands before 1507 is obscure, but it cannot seriously be maintained that they were subject to Persian sovereignty all through the Arab, Mongol and Tartar invasions and the anarchy of the Middle Ages. On the contrary, modern historians have expressed the opinion that from the 11th to,r the beginning of the 16th century the inhabitants of Bahmn S their owl race and among categorically that the Tdrisi writing m the latter half of the l^tn ctnm v, therefore, impossible to island was then governed by an mdependent^chmf■ J^dto Persia before 1507. , accept the view that the 1S !1 | , ' l 2 , islands were occupied by the Portuguese, as Between the years 150/ and 1622 the isla of PergiaI1 ru l e began m the Persian Government th “ nsel y® ,, pf ™ an troo ps we re finally driven out of the 1622 and ended m 1783, when the 1 ck- P f Bahrein hut it is not to be islands by the ancestors of the presentj-tei gggnaancy, Persian rule was supposed 'that even during t,u 'P e ''? &lt; ;’ . brought peace and prosperity to the continuous and unchallenged, or that it , J= ^ ion 0 f the Portuguese was inhabitants. The Persian occupation aft«'the expulsK)^ ^ ^ year l718 a of uncertain duration, but it seems h the Qmani Arabs, who then occupied it descent was made upon the mhu j - century control appears to have for a short period.

AT ifl mdepenaence^ ^ of the histori cal events summarised above that the second ‘ , Pevsian Government must be examined, viz., that pait ot th ^ Xnowuuder reMyln whXry affirm as an alleged principle o international “aw ^e statement that “ a territorv belonging by lawfully detached so long as the right of ownership has J 0 y it ; ;nnexation by another State or its independence have not been officially recfcnised bv the lawful owner of the territory.’ ’ Even if this statement could be accepted as valid, it would still be necessary for Persia to prove that she is. or ever has been the lawful owner of Bahrein, and that such rights as she may have acquired’ in former ages by conquest and the exercise of force outweigh those not only of the Portuguese, but of the Arab inhabitants themselves. _ , v 6 His Maiesty’s Government, however, deny without hesitation that any such principle, if alleged to be of universal application, forms part of inter national law. The assertion that the consent of the dispossessed State n invariably required to validate a change of sovereignty is contradicted both by international practice and the facts of history. Moreover it would, if it existed seriously prejudice the maintenance of peace and international ordei. It wornd be open to any State to advance a claim to territory, of which it has not f centuries been in effective possession, on the ground that its loss of possession m distant ages had not been confirmed by a subsequent treaty. To assert such a leo-al principle would be to assert that on a disputed question of territory the one factor that is decisive is the expressed will of one of the disputants. On me contrary in cases where a territory has effectively established its independence of the former sovereign, a treaty by which the disposed owner recognises its independence is in effect chiefly valuable as conclusive evidence that, m the view of the former sovereign, such independence has been effectively established. In such cases the effective establishment by the territory of its independence is the deciding factor in the question of international title, and in the case of Bahrein His Majesty’s Government regard as wholly untenable the proposition that effective possession and administration by the present ruling family for 145 years, during which these rulers have been independent of Persia, and during which no Persian authority has been exercised in their dominions, can be affected by the mere consideration that the Persian Government have not set their signature to a document formally recognising the fact of their independence.centuiy as independent rulers, it was thus not necessary for His ^ 9 11 y argument advanced by the Persian Government in support of their claim is the statement that the sheikhs of Bahrein at some time later than the end of the 18th century declared in writing; their entire submission and fidelity to the Persian Government, and that they paid tribute to the Persian Government. Although the Persian Government do not give any details in corroboration of this assertion, and although it would probably be difficult at the present day to prove the authenticity of any documents which may be in their possession, Plis Majesty’s Government are perfectly prepared to admit the possibility that such documents may exist. They do not, however, consider that the existence of such documents, or even evidence, were this forthcoming, of payments by the Rulers of Bahrein to the Government of the Shah can be regarded as establishing the validity of Persia’s claim. They have always been well aware that the unfortunate rulers of the islands, surrounded by warlike and more powerful States which menaced their independence, professed on various occasions during the first sixty or seventy years of the 19th century an unwilling allegiance to Muscat, to Persia, to Turkey, to the rulers of the mainland of Arabia, even to Egypt—to any Power, in short, who would agree to offer them protection and seemed at the time in a strong enough position to do so; and that at different times for short periods they paid tribute to Muscat, Egypt, or the Wahabi Arabs of the mainland. Any argument based on payment of tribute would, therefore, be available in support of a claim to sovereignty over Bahrein by any of the States to which tribute was, in fact, paid, and, in any case, it is evident that this timid and vacillating policy pursued on occasion by his predecessors cannot be held to affect the position of the present sheikh, who is firm in his determination to resist the Persian Government’s claims, and has empowered His Majesty’s Government to refute them on his behalf, in virtue of the treaties which give them the right of defending Bahrein from external aggression. 9. In view of the fact that the Persian Government do not base any part of their claim on the alleged recognition of that claim by His Majesty’s Government in the past, it seems unnecessary here to reply in detail to the various arguments by which the Persian Government endeavour to show that their claims have received British recognition in the past. I have already, in my note of the 18th January, 1928, explained that it has never on any occasion been the intention of His Majesty’s Government to admit the validity of Persia’s claims, and I must now ask the Persian Government to believe that a further full and careful examination of the contemporary records confirms that statement in its entirety. Ever since the year 1820, when His Majesty’s Government first entered into special treaty relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein without any reference to the Government of the Shah, they have acted on the assumption that the sheikh is an independent ruler. In 1822, when Captain William Bruce was recalled for having negotiated the terms of an agreement with the Prince Governor of Shiraz without their authority, the main reason recorded for his recall and for the prompt disavowal of this tentative agreement is that “ it acknowledges the King of Persia’s title to Bahrein, of which there is not 425 the least proof.” [10356—3] No clearer statement could possibly have been made of the c10 , . . , „• Maiestv - S Government at that date, more than a century ago; views held by His Maje. , oitpr their opinion. , they have never since seen any reason to - *29th April 1869, to which the ' 10.

Their obiect, as stated by Lord Clarendon in 1869 was the suppression of piracy and the maintenance of peace in the Gulf; they strictly confined themselves to the measures necessary to attain that object, and while it mig have been open to them to establish their dominion over the sheikh, they did not choose to do so, but contented themselves with an arrangement to secure t ie safety of international shipping without imposing on themselves the ourden of administration. They maintained this position not only m 1820 but on other occasions in subsequent years, and notably in 1848, when they declined to accede to the sheikh’s request that his dominions should be incorporated m those o± Her Majesty the Queen. The treaty of 1820, by which the Sheikh of Bahrein hound himself to abstain from plunder and piracy by land and sea, Horn the slave traffic and from inter-tribal war was followed m 1847, m 1856, and Ibbl by further treaties designed to secure the same objects^ the suppression or slavery and the general pacification of the Gulf in the interests of international shipping- The British Government concluded all these treaties with the sheikh as an mdependent ruler, and consistently refused throughout to admit the Turkish Persian and other claims to sovereignty over his dominions. It was not until the treaty of 1861 that Her Majesty’s Government, in return for the sheikh’s undertaking to abstain from maritime aggression, war and piracy, assured him in return of their support against similar aggression, nor till a still later period in 1880 and 1892, that they took upon themselves the unqualified liability for the foreign relations of that ruler, under which he has now invoked their assistance in repelling what he not unnaturally regards as a wholly unprovoked attempt on his independence by a foreign Government,12. In conclusion, His Majesty’s Government cannot refrain from expressing their surprise that the Persian Government should have referred in this correspondence to article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations under which the members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of a members of the League; a,nd that they should seemingly imagine that e teims of this article lay an obligation on members of the League to support Persian pretensmns to an island which is separated from Persia by the whole c -^ ersian Gidfi and over which Persia has exercised no authority tor 145 years. J 13. It will be evident to the Persian Government that His Mai'esty’s Government m the United Kingdom have carefully weighed the arguments advanced m the note now under reply, and that although they have found no reason to modify their previous opinions, their attitude is dictated by their genuine conviction that those arguments are untenable, and is in no way inspired by a policy hostile to Persia s legitimate aspirations. They cannot believe that the true interests of Persia can be served by a continued refusal to recognise the long-standing independence of the State of Bahrein. They are, indeed/hopeful that the Government of the Shah, whose enlightened domestic policy thev have long followed with friendly interest, will acknowledge the desirability of establishing good relations with Persia’s neighbours, and, realising that their present antiquated claim cannot properly be sustained and is an insurmountable obstacle to the establishment of such good relations with the Government and people of Bahrein, will on further consideration desist from its pursuit. 14. A copy of this note has been sent to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. I have, &amp;c. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.§3. (ii). Articles have beer, appearing in the 'Iraq Press reporting an interview given to the Saut-al-Ahrar newspaper of Beyrout by one 'All bin Salim, described as n 'notable of Bahrain', at which *Ali bln Salim is stated to have said 'that some negotiations war© taking pl&amp;e© between the British Political Agent and the Al Khalifah Shaikh® of Bahrain, for entering into a treaty for a period of 2b years*. He concluded his interview by saying 'that some of the Amirs of the M Khalifah will be coming to the Lebanon to spend the summer and that the eldest from among them will go to I* on don to sign the treaty* 1 . Shaikh ♦Abdullah bin ’Ism Al Khalifah, brother of the Ruler, was later approached by a correspondent and contradicted the reported interview given by VAli bin Salim, adding that **I do not know who is ♦All bin Salim on whom you have relied for publishing the information. There is no foundation at all for the information given by him about negotiations and a treaty. Our relations with Britain have been defined and established since a century.* It is believed that the ♦All bin Salim referred to by the Saut-al-Ahrar was none other than * All bln Husain al Khalf&amp;n, who has been on leave to Syria* He ha© now been dismissed from his post as Secretary to the Man am ah Municipality.The memorandum brings out the only appreciable flaw in our Bahrein case - the 1869 note - very lucidly and fairly. It is not the only instance when we have had cause to regret going out of our way to humour Persia with face- saving formulae. She is adept at converting them into weapons against us. But as the memorandum points out our 1869 note to Persia, whatever its proper construction, is not valid as against thexlsheik. It is indeed the essence of our contention throughout that Bahrein is an independent State. Bahrein is not ours to give to Persia, or to withhold. Even if we sent such a note to Persia today when Bahrein ‘ y ^ ^ has entrusted us with the ijumtuel of her foreign affairs, it could not have the effect of transferring sovereignty from Bahrein to Persia. In 1869 we had no vestige of a locus standi at all. It is throughout/« 2 o throughout useful to.remind ourselves that our Bahrein case with Persia is only a subsidiary aspect ol Bahrein f s case against Persia* ALEAGUE OE NATIONS Communicated to the Council and the Members of the League.

The situation » y however be eunraarieed ae follows. E. THe Sheikhdom was for some time prior to 1783 under Persian rule. The Persians were in that year driven out of the islands by \rabs from the mainland of Arabia under the leadership of the direct ancestor of the present ruling house, in whom sovereignty has rested since that date. Claims to sovereignty, or poesibly in some cases suzerainty, over Bahrain have repeatedly been preferred by Persia since 1783, 'I’hey were also preferred by Turkey (suzerain up to the War of the adjoining mainland) with great insistence on a number of occasions between 1847 and 1913, in which latter year the Turkish Government finally recognised the independence of the island; and they have been put forward in the past by Muscat; by gypt; and by the Wahabi Amirs of the Arab mainland. Tribute was last certainly paid to Persia In 1799. it has at one time or other between 1800 and 1870 been paid alro to Muscat, to Kgypt, and to the Wahabi Amirs, although in the case of the last-named, at any rate in the more recent period, poeeibly only in respect of posses ©ions on the mainland of Arabia. Bahrain at least since 1820 has conriste tly been regarded as independent by His Kajerty*8 Government, who have been in special treaty relations with its rulers on that basis f'ince that date. Those treaty relations (which have throughout involved contingent liabilities for protection) were strengthened in 1861, while by engagements contracted in 1880 and 1892 the ruling house have undertaken obligations which place their external relations in the hands of His Majesty 1 ® Government and preclude them from ceding territory save to, or with the consent of, His Majesty’s Government*6 # In 19£7 # 10m and 1929 important notes %ere exchanged between His Haiestjr *s OoverraRerit and the Persian Government in regard to the latter’s alai® to Bahrain* of which copies have been eossmmioated to the escretary General of the League of Hatton© for communication to the States Members of the League* Copies of these notes are attached as Paper B* On five other occasions since 192? the Persian Government have addressed protests to the Seo.rstary General of the League of Hat ion©* or c ommun tea ted to his copies of protests against alleged violations of their sovereignty* which they claim over the Bahrain Islands. Copies of the I%rslan Government # s letters to.’the Secretary General of the League are attached a© Papers G ~ G. In the first four of these latter oases* Hi® Hx^esty’s Goverrusent thought it mnecmmrv to return replies* In the case of the latest Persian protest (Paper G)» His Majesty’s Government have drawn the attention of the secretary General to their notes to the Persian Government of January 1926 and February 1929 (see Paper B) and requested him to circulate this reply to the Members of the League. In January 1953* the International Bureau of the universal Postal Union circulated to the member© of the Union a protest fro® the? Persian postal author!tie® regarding the proposed issue of Indian postage stamp©* surcharged ^Bahrain” and in April the bureau circulated the reply of the Indian postal authorities (Paper H). ?. on political and strategic grounds it Is regarded as of the first Importance to retain the eta.tun pup in Bahrain and to continue to reject the claim© put forward by Berria* Hi© Majesty’s Government* however* are anxious, to enable them to consider how beet to deal with any further assertion ofof the Persian claim, for the advice of the law Officers as to whether Persia possesses any rights in Bahrain* 8. While the Persian claim has hem asserted with great insistence over a very long period of years, the grounds adduced in support of it have varied from time to time and have never 'been stated hy the Persian Government in any very great detail. The fullest expression of the Persian attitude ie that contained in the notes of 26th November 1927 and 2nd August 1928* The various arguments which, from time to time, Persia has advanced in support of her claim are as follows (1) The history of the islands prior to 1785* Persia contends that an appeal to history shows that prior to this date the islands were from a remote period subject, and tributary, to her* (2) The absence of Persian consent to the detachment of Bahrain, admittedly at one stage prior to 1785 a Persian possession, fro® Persia; and the fact that Persia Ms never recognised the islands as independent and has consistently urged a claim to them* (3) Certain provisions of the treaty (unratified and disavowed by both parties) concluded between Captain Bruce, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the Minister of the Prince Governor of Bhiras, in 1892. (4) a gold coin alleged to have been struck at Bahrain In 1817. ( 6 ) Payment by Bahrain at various stages of 'peeshkesh”, offerings, or tribute to Persia. (6) Plying of the Persian flag by the Sheikh of Bahrain. (7) Letters from past rulers of Bahrain admitting Persian suzerainty.(8) A, Note addressed by His Majesty* 8 OoTernaent in April 1869 to the Persian Minister in London, (9) Closeness of relations at the present day between I'erria and Bahrain. 9. The arguments referred to in the preceding paragraph are briefly examined in paragraphs 147-188 of the historical memorandom (Paper a) attached, which suggests the conclusion that they afford no solid basis for a Persian claim to sovereignty or suzerainty over the Island of Bahrain. 10. Apart froHs the arguments based on historical events, the only important legal consideration which Ms been advanced by the Persian Government in support of their claim is that contained in paragraph 2 of the note addressed by the Acting Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty’s Gharg£ d ’Affaires at Tehran on 2nd August, 1928 (page 4, pcAoer B). You will observe that a detailed reply to this argument was made in paragraphs 6-8 of the note addressed by Sir Austen Chamberlain to the Persian Minister in London on 18th February, 1929 (pages 8 and 9, paper B). Reference may also be made in this connexion to the article entitled 'Sovereignty, Seisin and the League' by fir John ^iseher Williams, (British Yearbook of International law, 1926, page 24.) 11. I have accordingly the honour to request you to take the enclosed papers into your consideration, and to advise, in the light of the facts stated in the historical memorandum (Paper A), the various arguments which have been employed on either side in the course of the discussion of this question, and of any other considerations which may appear to you to be relevant, whether in your opinion Persia possessespo^esree any right* in or over Mhrain, and if EQ ,t»t the nature of thopf rights it*. 12.

The Middle East conmittee were anxious that the necessary reference should be made to the Law Officers before the recess, and the Foreign Office agreed that in view of this it would not be practicable to examine in detail the history of Bahrein prior to 1783 - a task which would have meant considerable research. &lt;5* A historical memorandum, an uncorrected proof of which is attached, has now been prepared In the Department, which briefly examines the history of Bahrein prior to 1783 and deals with it in detail subsequently to that date. A draft reference to the Law Officers has been prepared, after discussion with Mr. Waltoni in consultation with the Foreign Office, and is now attached. As the House rises on 31st July the matter is one of great urgency, and the Foreign Office are anxious if possible that the reference should be despatched to the Law Officers not later than Monday next. 4.

List of papers. .on Gentlemen, I have the honour, by directi of Secretary Sir John Simon, to transmit to you the papers noted in the accompanying list, and to request the favour of your opinion on the subject of the rights claimed by Persia in the Archipelago of Bahrein. 2. Bahrein is a small archipelago lying on the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf and almost land-locked by the Arabian province of Hasa in the dominions of Ibn Saud, the ruler of Saudi Arabia, and by the Peninsula of Qatar, which is the territory of the independent urab Sheikh of Qatar. The population of Bahrein is essentially Arab by race, though since the beginning of the present century there has been a considerable influx of Persian nationals. 3. The archipelago is of considerable commercial importance. The pearl banks by which it is surrounded make it the centre of a pearl trade which, in good years is of very considerable dimensions, while oil has recently been discovered there. Its strategic position in the centre of the Persian Gulf, always important, has become still more so of late years with the development of the air route to India and the possibility that it may be desirable to use the island as a British naval station. 4./s r uuu i^xeparea by e India Office, and dealing the history of Bahrein both before and after 1783 is attached (Paper A). The questions ^ t0 WhiCh y ° Ur advi °e 13 desired relate almost entirely to the historical facts there set out, and it has therefore been thought necessary to state those facts in detail. The situation may however be summarised as follows. 5. The Sheikhdom was for some time prior to 1783 unfer Persian rule. The Persians were in that year driven out of the islands by Arabs from the mainland of Arabia under the leadership of the direct ancestor of the present ruling house, in whom sovereignty has rested since that date. Claims to sovereignty, or possibly in some cases suzerainty, over Bahrein have repeatedly been preferred by Persia since 1783. They were also preferred by Turkey (suzerain up to the War of the adjoining mainland) with great insistence on a number of occasions between 1847 and 1913, in which latter year the Turkish Government finally recognised the independence of the island; and they have been put forward in the past by Muscat; by Egypt; and by the Wahabi Amirs of the Arab mainland. Tribute was last certainly paid to Persia in 1799. It has at one time or other between 1800 and 1870 been paid also to Muscat, to E Sypt&gt; and to the Wahabi Amirs, although in the case of the latter, at any rate in the more recent period, possibly only in respect of/ox possessions on the mainland of Arabia, Bahrein at least since 1820 has consistently been regarded as independent by who have been in special treaty relations with its rulers on that basis since that date. Those treaty relations (which have throughout involved contingent liabilities for protectLcn) were strengthened in 1861, while by engagements contracted in 1880 and 1892 the ruling house have undertaken obligations which place their external relations in the hands of H.M.G. and preclude them from ceding territory save to, or with the consent of, H.M.G. 6. The Persian Government have since 1927 on occasions reasserted in notes addressed to H.M.G. or H.M.Representative at Tehran their claim to Bahrein and have communicated copies of the notes in question to the Secretary General of the League of Nations for communication to the States Members of the League. H.M.G. have expressed their inability to accept the Persian claim as well-founded and have given their reasons in detail for this contention in notes to the Persian Government dated 18th January 1928 and 29th February 1929. Copies of these notes also have been communicated to the Secretary General of the League of Nations and have been circulated by him, at the request of H.M.G., to the States Members of the League. Copies of the Notes exchanged with the Persian Government/4. Government in 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930 and 1934 are attached as Paper B. On political and strategic grounds it is regarded as of the first importance to retain the status quo in Bahrein and to continue to reject the claims put forward hy Persia. however, are anxious, to enable them to consider how best to deal with any further assertion of the Persian claim, for the advice of the Law Officers as to whether Persia possesses any rights in Bahrein. 7. While the Persian claim has been asserted with great insistence over a very long period of years, the grounds adduced in support of it have varied from time to time and have never been stated by the Persian Government in any very great detail. The fullest expression of the Persian attitude is that contained in the notes of 26th November 1927 and 2nd August 1928. The various arguments which, from time to time, Persia has advanced in support of her claim are as follows:- (1) The history of the islands prior to 1783. Persia contends that an appeal to history shows that prior to this date the islands were from a remote period subject, and tributary, to her. (2) The absence of Persian consent to the detachment of Bahrein, admittedly at one stage prior to 1783 a Persian possession, from Persia; and the fact that Persia has never recognised the islands as independent and has consistently urged a claim to them. ...5 (3) Certain provisions ofthe treaty (unratified and disavowed by both parties) concluded between Captain Bruce, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the Minister of the Prince Governor of Shiraz, in 189S. (4) A gold coin alleged to have been struck at Bahrein in 1817 . (5) Payment by Bahrein at various stages of 'peeshkesh', offerings, or tribute to Persia. (6) Plying of the Persian flag by the Sheikh of Bahrein. (7) Letters from past rulers of Bahrein admitting Persian suzerainty. (8) A Note addressed by H.M.G. in April 1869 to the Persian Minister in London. (9) Closeness of relations at the present day between Persia and Bahrein. 8. The arguments referred to in the preceding paragraph are briefly examined in paragraphs 147-15^ of the historical memorandum (Paper A) attached, which suggests the conclusion ire-^eaehe-d that they afford no solid basis for a Persian claim to sovereignty or suzerainty over the Island of Bahrein. 9. Apart from the arguments based on historical events, the only important legal consideration which has been advanced by the Persian Government in support of their claim is that contained in paragraph 2 of the note addressed by the Acting Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to H.M.Charge' d T Affaires/^_d'Affaires at Tehran on August 2nd, 1928 (paper ii). You will observe that a detailed reply to this argument was made in paragraphs 5-8 of the note addressed by Sir Austen Chamberlain to the Persian Minister in London on February 18th, 1929 (P a ge paper £ ). Reference may also be made in this connection to the article entitled 'Sovereignty, Seisin and the League” by Sir John Fischer Williams, Yearbook of International Law, 1926, page 24.) 10. I have accordingly the honour to iequest you to take the enclosed papers into your consideration, and to advise, in the light of the facts stated in the historical memorandum (Paper A), the various arguments which have been employed on either side in the course of the discussion of this question, and of any other considerations which may appear to you to be relevant^ whether in your opinion Persia possesses any rights in or over Bahrein, and if so what the nature of those rights is. 11. The question of our future policy in regard to Persia, as to which the Ministerial Middle Bast Sub-Committee may have to take important decisions at any moment, may be to a considerable extent dependent upon the nature of your opinion on the above point, and Sir John Simon would therefore be grateful if it vvere possible for you to furnish your opinion at a very early date.India Office.

T he Principality of Bahrein consists of the archipelago formed b/the islands of Bahrein, Muharraq, Umm Na’asan feitra, and Isabi Salih, and by a number of lesser islets and rocks, laken altogether these form a compact group almost m the middle of the V-shaped gulf on the Arabian littoral Lor ' n ’ 234 ‘ of the Persian Gulf which divides the independent Arab Trucial Sheikhdom of Qatar from the coast of Qatif in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. ^ 2. The term “ Bahrein ” formerly embraced the promon tory of Qatar and the oases of Qatif and Elasa on the Arabian mainland, as well as the islands of the archipelago, and, according to Lorimer, “ some authorities would attribute to it in the past an even more extended application, affirming Lor - n ’ 233 that it once denoted the whole western side of the Persian Gulf from Ruus-al-Jibal to the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab.” II.—Bahrein prior to 1783. 3. The very conflicting evidence available goes to show Bombay that Bahrein w T as subject to Persian rule for a period m the Selections, early part of the Christian era, and between A.D. 615 and xxr V 23. 723. It is stated to have been conquered by one Keshan bin 2s r o is Abdul Malik, and to have come under the sway of the of 22.2 1870 Oommiyyad Caliphs, in the latter year, and to have remained para.’2. under the control of the Caliphs until the close of the Wilson Abbaside dynasty in the 11th century, when it again became PersianGulf, subject to chiefs of its own race. Its mediaeval history is PP- 85 ~ 6 - obscure, but a writer who visited the islands in A.D. 1051 refers to the fact that half of the pearls taken in Bahrein belong to the Chiefs of Flasa on the Arab mainland. Idrisi, Wilson, the Arab geographer, writing about a century later, states 88_9 °- 2953 50 7.34 aWilson, 105. Wilson, 116. Wilson, 121. Wilson, 124. Lor. I, 841. Wilson, 140. Lor. 1, 836.

The Persians have adopted in a recent Note on the subject a statement that it remained under Portuguese oor h r ° from 1507 to 1622. It would appear, however, that theie are at any rate some breaks in the continuity of Portuguese control. An agreement of 1515 between the Portuguese and the Persians, under which the King of Hormuz was to be ruler of Hormuz in the name of King Dom Manuel, his Lora provided inter alia that Portuguese shipping should be available to enable the Persians to invade Bahrein and Qatit. In 1522 a revolt stimulated by the King of Hormuz broke out against the Portuguese at Bahrein among other places, but was quelled, and in 1528 endeavours by the Portuguese to quell a subsequent rebellion in Bahrein against the King were beaten off. In 1559 it was temporarily occupied by the Turks, who were, however, driven out by the Portuguese in the same year. In 1602 the Portuguese were forcibly expelled from the islands by the Persians. Ihe 1 ersian occupation was of uncertain duration, and in their Koto of 2nd August 1928 they refer to 1622 as the date on which Persia regained possession of Bahrein. They appear in any event to have had a military depot in Bahrein in 1622. Curzon states that '‘the Portuguese ... in 1625 concluded a treaty with Shah Abbas, by which they restored to him all his' coast possessions, retaining only the pearl banks at I'v 1 • 5 5 4 . In or about 1718 the islands were occupied by the Arabs of Muscat, who, however, appear to have maintained their occupation for a short time only. It is not clear whether at the date of this attack the islands were derelict or whether they were held by a Persian garrison. About 1753 the Ruler under the Persian Government of the town of Bushire made a descent upon Bahrein, the chief resident tribe in which (the Huwalah Arabs at the present day still strongly represented in the islands) was seriously divided by internal feuds, and established his authority there. In this manner the islands again became, at least in Lor. I, 837. name) dependent on Persia. In 1782 the Arabs of Zubarah, on the Arabian mainland, efforts to reduce which had been made by the Governor of Bahrein under the Persians in the years immediately preceding that date, retaliated by a descent on the island of Bahrein. They defeated the Lor. 1,839- p ers i arL Governor, drove him to his fort, plundered and 4U * destroyed the town of Manama, and took possession of a Bushire vessel, with which they retired to Zubarah. A counter attack was repulsed, and in the following year the Uttabi Arabs of Zubarah, assisted by contingents from various tribes of Qatar, occupied the Bahrein islands, the Persian garrison of the Manama Fort capitulating on 28th July 1783, after a siege of about two months’ duration, and being allowed to return to Bushire. Summary. 5 . It will be seen that while the history of Bahrein prior to 1783 is very obscure, it would appear that Persia for not inconsiderable periods exercised control over the islands. The nature of that control is not, however, very clear; it seems probable that it was only very rarely of a definite character; and even in more recent periods3 * ersian relations with the islands were for a substantial number of years interrupted by Portuguese occupation of or Tpereknrns^T tlem ' w is &gt;. however - clear that Persia Xrfni the 1 • ln effe , ctn ' e control of the islands during the 30 years prior to the expulsion of the Persians by the Arabs of the mainland in 1783; m.— 1783-1820.

Projects by the Persian Government for the re- -estabiishment of its authority in Bahrein between 1783 and 1800 did not materialise. In 1799 the Imam of Muscat declared war on the Uttabis of Bahrein, who, alarmed bv his proceedings, opened a correspondence with the Persian Governor of Busline, in the course of which they stated that the island originally belonged to the Turkish Government but that it was many—about 70—years since the Turks had been in possession of it/' He, on their offering to become -^ or - h tributary^ to Persia, proceeded privately to Bahrein and received from them an instalment of revenue on account of ■the preceding year. Muscat occupies and loses Bahrein, 1800-01. 7. In 1800 Bahrein was occupied by the Imam of Muscat, the occupation lasting until 1801, when the Muscat forces were invested by the Uttabis and compelled to surrender and evacuate Bahrein. In 1802 the Imam of Muscat, having obtained some assistance from Bushire, again landed in Bahrein and attacked the Uttabis. The latter had, however, by now secured the support of the Wahabi rulers of Central Arabia and the Muscat project 'was abandoned. Bahrein under Wahabi influence, 1803-11. 8 . From 1803 to 1809 the Uttabis of Bahrein appear to have been under the influence of the Wahabis, (the Bombay Government declined to take action on an enquiry made by them in 1805 as to whether, if they withdrew from the Arabian mainland and withheld their assistance from the of *• Wahabis, the British Government would give them a ship or 18 two to enable them to remain undisturbed at Bahrein) and para. 5 . ’ they were under strict control by the Wahabi Government Lor.1,842-3. -during 1810-11.

In 1811 the islands were freed from Wahabi rule by the Imam of Muscat, when the Uttabis were restored to power, though according to a claim subsequently made by by the Imam, in subordination to Muscat. In 1816 the Uttabis sought the protection of the Wahabi rulers of Central Arabia, and the Imam of Muscat undertook an armed expedition against Bahrein, explaining to the British authori ties that he was compelled so to act by the repudiation by the Attabis of his suzerainty, which they had admitted in 1811, by their alliance with the Wahabis and by their piratical practices. The Muscat expedition, to which three Bushire vessels were added by the Persian Government, effected a landing in the summer of 1816, but was signally repulsed and withdrew. Unsuccessful negotiations took place later in the same year between Muscat and the Persian Bo. Sel., Government with a view to a fresh attempt on Bahrein. XXIV, 372. Subsequently, but apparently in the same year, a Persian • emissary, one Sikancler Khan, arrived in Bahrein, who * This was, of course, incorrect.

Approval for the grant of the military 6 51817 assistance desired was stated to have been given by the Shah to the Imam, but no action appears to have followed. 11. In 1818, on the appearance of the Egyptians inllasa, the Sheikh of Bahrein appears to have offered to assist them Lor. 1,846. w ith sea transport. In February 1819 the Sheikh entered into an agreement with the British Government, with the terms of which he subsequently failed to comply, for preventing the sale of captured British piopeit) m his dominions, and in the same year he expressed great indignation at the violation by the British authorities, undei a misapprehension as to the nationality of certain vessels, of the neutrality of his port. 12. On the 19th April 1819 His Majesty’s Representative at Tehran reported to the Government of India that the 25.5.1819. Imam of Muscat had complained bitterly against the non- fulfilment of the engagements contracted with him by the Persian Government for the capture of Bahrein. The Minister added that letters received by him showed that the troops of Ibrahim Pasha, the Viceroy of Egypt, had occupied Bahrein (this appears to have been incorrect) and that the Imam had suggested to the Shah that he should send a messenger to the Pasha asking him to evacuate the island. The Imam is stated to have urged upon the Shah the necessity of endeavouring to recover a possession which according to him “ had for ages acknowedged the sovereignty of Persia.” He was, however, unsuccessful, and in June 1819 His Majesty’s Minister reported that the Shah had “ for the present ” dropped all intention of taking any steps in pursuit of his pretensions to the sovereignty of the island. It may be added here that the Government of Bombay in a despatch of 21st July 1819 to the Government of India, in which they discussed the desirability of assisting the Imam of Muscat, in return for assistance in connection with the expedition proposed against the Gulf pirates, to establish his claims to Bahrein, referred to an “ arrangement some time since concerted ” between the Shah and the Imam, whereby the former had agreed to relinquish all claims to the island of Bahrein in favour of the Imam, under the condition of receiving a portion of its revenues.” Bahrein submits to Muscat, 1820. 13. The Persians, at the beginning of 1820, moved apparently by a desire to anticipate any attempt by Muscat to establish control over Bahrein with the support of His Majesty’s Government, unsuccessfully requested the Imam to convey their troops to Bahrein.

On the 1/th January 1820 the Sheikh agreed to surrender certain pirate craft which had taken refuge in his territories, and undertook to the British Government not to. admit any more boats of the same character until authorised to do so by the British authorities. On the 5th February 1820 a preliminary Treaty of Peace was signed between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government, and on the 23rd February 1820 the Sheikhs were admitted to the benefits of the General Treaty of Peace which had been made between His Majesty’s Government and the Arab rulers of the Persian Gulf and under which Plis Majesty’s Government undertook, in return for abstention by those rulers from piracy and the slave trade, that “ if any shall attack them the British Government shall take notice of it ” (Article 10). The Sheikh of Bahrein went so far as to claim subsequently that the treaty in question established relations * of protection and dependence between the British Government and himself, but it was made clear to him by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf while on a visit to Bahrein in 1823 that this was uot the case. Proposal for British Mediation with Bahrein not taken up by Persia, 17.

The Shah had replied that “ he wished that advices should be received from Shiraz before the mediation of the Teh.

Willock remarked that “ the great repugnance of the Shah to the formation of any British settlement in the neighbourhood of Persia was strongly manifested by His Majesty's not immediately accepting the British mediation to obtain a tribute from the island of Bahrein, an object which he so urgently desired and which His Majesty was aware must at a future period be difficult of attainment from the already advanced stage of negotia tions between the Sheikhs of Bahrein and the Imam of Muscat.” and withdrawn (1820). No. 1485 to 1^. On the 3rd October 1820 the Government of Bombay Tehran. instructed Sir H. Willock to take the earliest opportunity of informing the Persian Government “ that as our views are exclusively .limited to the extirpation of piracy, it would be contrary to our policy, in the present state of the Gulf, to afford the mediation we formerly offered between His Majesty [the Shah] and the Uttabis of Bahrein.” Summary, 1783-1820. 19. In 1799 the Sheikhdom, independent since 1783, professed allegiance to Persia and paid a year’s tribute, but it was immediately afterwards conquered by the Imam of Muscat, and thereafter fell under the influence and ultimately the control of the Wahabi Amir. Liberated by Muscat in 1811, it appealed to the Wahabis in 1816 against the Imam and defeated him. In 1816 or 1817 a Persian envoy was received at Bahrein and presents exchanged. While no details are available as to what precisely took place on this occasion, the incident had no effective sequel. Persian authority was not asserted in the island between the date of the visit and 1820, and in the latter year the island became temporarily subject and tributary to Muscat. In 1820 Bahrein entered into its first formal treaty with the British Government, and that Government, on condition that the Sheikhs abstained from piracy, undertook to “ take notice ” “if any shall attack them.” IV.—1820-30. Unauthorised Agreement between Captain Bruce and the Prince Governor of Shiraz, 1822. 20. In 1822 Captain Bruce, then Political Resident in the Pei sian Gulf, acting on his own initiative and without any authority from or prior reference to Government, having proceeded of his own accord to Shiraz there signed an agreement with the Minister of the Prince Governor of Shiraz, on the part of Persia. This agreement alleged, inter aha, m regard to Bahrein, that the islands had always been subordinate to the Governor of Ears, against whose authoritv the Uttabi Sheikhs had lately become rebellious; that the flag assigned to the Uttabis of Bahrein under the General Treaty of Peace with Britain in 1820 should accordingly, if already gianted, be withdrawn, that no assistance should in future be rendered by Britain to the Uttabis of Bahrein, and that on the contrary the British Government should, if requested, assist the Persians against Bahrein with “ one Rmf*o ° r t , W0 ” vesse ! s of war * In other words, the title of Persia to Govt of t0 tlie Possessiou of Bahrein was explicitly admitted.

In October 1828 a last attack by the Imam of Muscat was severely defeated and driven off, ‘‘after several undignified attempts to conclude a peace with the bneikns of Bahrein, and on 2nd December 1829 peace was finally made between the Sheikhs and the Imam. liie main provisions of this agreement were that tribute should not in future be paid by Bahrein to Muscat, and that neither ruler should henceforth interfere in the affairs of the other. By a supplementary verbal agreement the parties bound them selves to aid one another in the event of an attack by a third party. Summary, 1820-30. 26. During the first two years of this period the islands acknowledged the supremacy of and, for a time, paid tribute to Muscat. From 1822 to 1829 they were intermittently at feud with Muscat. In 1829 a treaty was cod eluded by which Muscat withdrew its claims to supremacy and to tribute. The Persian claim was alluded to in 1822 and 1825 but not pressed. V—182(1-40. Bahrein and the Wahabis, 1830-35. 27. In the course of 1830-31 the Sheikhs, Plis Majesty’s Government having refused to intervene in their favour, and fearing a combination between the Amir and Muscat, formally submitted to the Wahabi Amir of the Arab mainland. They agreed to acknowledge the Amir’s supremacy and to pay a tribute to him. He on his part undertook to protect Lor. 1,856-7. Bahrein against external aggression. In 1833, however, the Sheikh felt strong enough to repudiate Wahabi supremacy, and he conducted a not unsuccessful offensive against the Wahabis between 1833 and 1835. Bahrein and the British Government. 28. Sheikh Khalifah-bin-Salman, who had been joint Lor, I, iii, ruler with his uncle Sheikh Abdulla since the death of Table 9. Sheikh Salman in 1825, died in 1834, and was succeeded as joint ruler by his son Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifah. Effective control continued to rest with Sheikh Abdullah. Internal dissension in the ruling family became more marked between 1834 and 1839, and the misgovernment of the island continued to grow with unfortunate effects on its prosperity. His Majesty’s Government, although in 1834 they had to take forcible measures against the Sheikh to secure reparation for an insult to their Residency Agent in Bahrein, were, however, content to abstain from any interference in the internal affairs of Bahrein so long as the Sheikhs discharged the obligations undertaken by their Treaty of 1820. Restrictive Line applied to Bahrein, 1836. 29. In 1835 the British Government renewed the maritime truce which they had imposed in 1820 on the Arab rulers of the Gulf in the interest of the suppression of piracy. The Sheikh of Bahrein was not, however, included in the renewed truce, partly apparently because he had Lor. I, 860 behaved so wmll that this was thought unnecessary, partly Precis, 250. because he could be easily ppnished in the event of this proving desirable, and partly lest in the event of his inclusion he might claim British intervention if attacked by Muscat.

Phe Egyptian Commander about lie same time intimated to the British authorities his inten tion to attack and reduce the island. The Sheikh appealed tor assistance to the Government of India, but in the absence of instructions from Her Majesty’s Government the Govern- mem of India were at first not prepared to give him any pledge and the Sheikh was instructed to decide for himself as to waiting on the Egyptian representative. Much alarmed by the proceedings of the Egyptians, “and perhaps even more so by a rumour, apparently well founded, that the Saiyed of Oman was intriguing with the Egyptians to obtain and hold Bahrein as a fief under the Viceroy of Egypt ,’ 5 the Sheikh thereon professed, in reply to demands made on him in the name of the Egyptians, to be a subject of the Persian Government. Apparently as the result of overtures by the Sheikh designed to substantiate this, the Prince Governor of Shiraz thereupon sent an envoy—one Haji Qasim, formerly supercargo of a trading vessel—to reside in Bahrein as Persian agent, “ and to be the medium of receiving and transmitting the annual tribute which the Persian authorities vainly flattered themselves the Bahrein Chief was^ disposed to pay for their countenance and protection ,’ 5 and to bear a Robe of Honour and a letter to the Sheikh. The envoy was accompanied by a guard of 10 Persian infantry. No details appear to be available about his mission, which was apparently a failure. 33. On 1st April .1839 Admiral Sir F. Maitland, then commanding the Gulf Squadron, was instructed by the Government of Bombay to give the Sheikh all support against the Egyptians, short of actually entering on hostilities. If the Sheikh asked for a new engagement with Her Majesty’s Government he should offer to transmit his proposals to India. The Resident was simultaneously to send a formal protest to the Egyptians.

The Resident protested m writing to both the Sheikh and the Egyptians, and expostulated with the Sheikh on the way in which he was sacrificing ins independence. The Sheikh explained that his action was the result of the refusal of Her Majesty’s Government to give him advice or a specific assurance of support, hoi a trifling financial payment he had now secured immuni y from Interference. He offered, however, in return for a written and distinct pledge of protection, to repudiate his agreement with the Pasha and to avow himself a dependent of Her Maiesty’s Government; but on being pressed fie refused to confirm this in writing and said that m any event it would be necessary for him to justify his change of attitude to the Egyptians on the ground that it was the result o compulsion by Her Majesty’s Government.

Views of Her Majesty’s Government on future Policy towards Bahrein. 35 As a consequence of the activities of the Egyptians discussion appears about this time to have taken place as to the desirability of declaring a regular protectorate over Bahrein. On 1st July 1839 the Secret Committee of the East India Company informed the Government of India that if necessary they would “ not disapprove of your entering into an engagement with the Chief of Bahrein to protect him against encroachments from Mehemet Ali, but we concur m the doubt expressed by Captain Hennell [then Political Resident] as to whether it would be expedient for that island to be taken under the protection of the British Government.” On 24th February 1840 the Foreign Office wrote to the India Board (with reference to an enquiry from the Bombay Government) that it was important that the Egyptian troops should not be allowed to take possession of Bahrein and that if the Company’s troops could occupy it, even provisionally* such a measure could not fail to be attended with advantage. On the retirement of the Egyptians from Hasa in 1840 their relations with the Sheikh came to an end. Summary, 1830-40. 36. From 1831-33 Bahrein was subject and tributary to the Wahabi Amirs.

Expulsion of Sheikh Abdullah. Succession of Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifa (1843-68). 39. Internal dissensions in the Sheikhdom between the ruler, yffeikh Abdullah, and his grand-nephew and co rnier, Sheikh Mohamed, became increasingly bitter, and Sheikh Mohamed was finally expelled from the island. In November 1842 he was given permission by Her Majesty’s Lor I 866 Government to attack Sheikh Abdullah. After a civil war which lasted from January to April 1843, Abdullah was expelled by Mohamed, who thereafter held the Sheikhdom, no reply being sent to an appeal to restrain the attackers w T hich was made by Abdullah to the British authorities in February 1843. Intrigues of ex-Sheikh, 1843-49. 40. Between 1843 and 1849 the ex-Sheikh appealed at various times for the assistance of the Wahabis, the Trficial Sheikhs,_ the Sheikh of Koweit, and the British and Persian authorities to enable him to recover his position. In 1843 Lor. I, 873. Her Majesty’s Government dissuaded Muscat from trying to •conquer Bahrein—considerations which weighed with them being inter alia the risk of provoking the Wahabis and the danger of giving Persia an excuse to espouse the cause of the ex-Sheikh. In the same year the ex-Sheikh twice visited Bushire, where he failed to find any consolation from the Resident, who, on his stating that if disappointed by Her Majesty’s Government he was ready to throw himself into the arms of Persia, informed him (October 1843) that the adherence of Persia to his cause would not be recognised by Britain unless it was open and declared. 41. In the course of his visits the ex-Sheikh entered into discussions wdth the nephew of the Persian Sheikh of Bushire, who, while holding no official position himself,Ceh. Desp. 36, Oot. 1843, jor.

It may be recorded that on a second visit of the ex-Sheikh to Bushire from December 1643 to March 18 , he is stated to have been received with distinction by the Persians, and to have offered, if reinstated to . th « c ° st &gt; to remit in future a large annual tribute to the shah and . leave one son as a hostage in Persia. His proposals were not, however, accepted by the Persian Government. 43 In 1844 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was instructed by the Government of India to resist by f orce any attempt by Persia to establish troops on the island of Bahrein. During the same year the ex-Sheikh, having, w u residing at Naband in South Persia, captured two Bahreini vessels, the ruling Sheikh appealed to the Resident, with the result that an injunction was issued by the Central 1 ersian Government at the instance of the British envoy directing the Governor-General of Ears to compel Sheikh Abdul a to give up the boats he had taken and abstain from disturbing thp, ncaue of the Gulf. Views of His Majesty’s Government on Persian Claim and on future Policy, 1844-45. 44. Cod sequent on indications that Persia intended to intervene in the succession at Bahrein on behalf of the ex-Sheikh Abdullah the general question of policy was considered by Her Majesty’s Government in the early part of 1844, in the light of an intimation by the Government of India that they would see the strongest objections to any such interference by Persia, which could not but react adversely on British interests. As a result, Her Majesty’s Minister was informed (Foreign Office Despatch to Tehran, No. 23, dated 1 st May 1844) that “ the question of the right of Persia to interfere and of the Indian Government to prevent interference necessarily depends upon the validity of the pretension put forward by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein. Her Majesty’s Government are ignorant of the grounds of such pretension, and, assuming those grounds to be insufficient, they would claim for the British Govern ment the right to prevent, if it accorded with its policy to do so, any direct interposition of Persia in the quarrels of rival claimants'to the possession of Bahrein. The British Government in India at present consider that any such disturbance as may be occasioned by military operations on the part of Persia directed against the island of Bahrein would be injurious to British interests, and, therefore, unless Persia can show that she has a clear and indis putable right to the sovereignty of Bahrein ; that she has exercised it without interruption under the dynasty of the Kajar family ; that consequently her present policy is directed to the maintenance of her lawful claims and not to the assertion of a pretension not founded on law, she must be13 472 UUCJ' nitty tiULlii lit.

In February 1845 the Minister at Tehran sent home Tell toF0 a letter ^ received from the Prime Minister, from which it isro. 19 of appeared that the Persian claim was essentially based on the 25.2.1845. Convention of 1822 between Captain Bruce and the Minister of the Prince Governor of Fars. (See paragraphs 20-21 above.) 4 7. In a subsequent despatch the Minister said that he Teh. to F.O., had informed the Prime Minister that the Bruce Agreement ■^°‘ ^ °* was unauthorised and had been repudiated at the time, and 18 - 3 - 1845 - that the Prime Minister had thereupon sent him a fuller statement of the grounds of the Persian claim. The result of enquiries which His Majesty’s Minister had made con sequent on the receipt of this statement “ confirmed me in the opinion that this island has not formed part of the dominions of Persia since the accession of the Kajar dynasty [17951. It is true that the Chiefs of Bahrein have in all probability from time to time given peeshkesh, offerings, or tribute to this country [Persia] as a mark of superiority, as Kandahar and Herat continue to do, without an acknow ledgment of subjection,* and it is also not unlikely that the rulers of that island may have declared themselves to be subjects of the Shah when threatened with subjugation from Bagdad, but I cannot ascertain that Persia has exercised any real control over it within the last 50 or 60 years.” The Minister added that in further support of their claim the Persian Government had sent him a gold coin struck at Bahrein in 1817 in the name of Fateh Ali Shah Kajar, which he believed to be genuine. 48. The fuller statement of claim put forward by the Secret ” om - Persian Government was investigated by the Secret Com- mittee of the East India Company, who, after detailed 31 .7,1845, ’ examination of it, reached the conclusion “ that Persia has no legitimate claim to the sovereignty of Bahrein.” It may be remarked that the Persian claim was largely based on a general claim that the Persian Gulf from the Shatt-el- Arab to Muscat and all the islands in it belonged to * On this point the Secret Committee of the East India Company remarked : “ Presents and complimentary messages do not imply an acknowledgment of sovereignty, and they have not been confined to Persia.” (Secret Committee to India Board, 31st July 1845.) 2953 .

Her Majesty’s Government, in view of the unlikeli hood' that Persia had, or could give effect to, any serious designs in Bahrein and the undesirability of engaging in those circumstances in a correspondence which might merely cause irritation without serving any useful purpose, instructed the Minister at Tehran not to revert to the subject unless it was forced upon him by the Persian 1 rime Minister. In that case he was to employ certain arguments supplied to him (apparently the critical comments of the Secret Committee of the East India Company on the I rime Minister’s memorandum) to show generally the grounds .on F.O. to Teh. which Her Majesty’s Government were “ unable to recognise J'o. 38 of ag va hd the claims advanced by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein, and you may add that they would . . . veiy much disapprove of any attempts on the part of Persia to interfere in the affairs of that island and thus disturb the peace. of the Gulf and to afford an opening to piracy.” The question appears to have dropped for the time being. Treaty of Peace with Wahabis, to whom Bahrein pays Tribute (1847). 50. Meanwhile, the ex-Sheikh (who in 1845 had unsuccess- Lor. 1,877. fully attempted to capture Bahrein with the aid of the Wahabis) had been invited in June 1846 by the Governor- Lor. I, 877. General of Ears to return to Bushire, where he should be liberally entertained “ until ... the season for action had Lor. I, 880. arrived,” but he declined the invitation. In October 1846 the Wahabi Amir asked the permission of the Resident to call in the Trucial Sheikhs of the Arab littoral against Bahrein. This was refused. A request by the ruling Sheikh of Bahrein to be allowed to call in the assistance of the Sheikh of Debai against the Wahabis was equally refused in November 1846. In August 1847 a Treaty of Peace was concluded between the Wahabi Amir and the ruling Sheikh, under which the ruling Sheikh agreed to pay a tribute of 4,000 dollars a year, while the Wahabi Amir agreed not to encourage the ex-Sheikh.

The Court of Directors concurred m the Government of JBombay’s recommendation that Ruy attempts upon Bahrein ought to be resisted by the British Naval Force” and that the Pesident should be so informed. 55. On 11 th October 1847 the Foreign Office, in a letter to the India Board, in which they referred to recent Turkish assurances that the lurkish Government had no intention of using compulsion with regard to Bahrein, added that “ if the Indian Government has any further apprehensions on the subject, and if the Bahrein Chief is really an independent ruler, the best course would be to make with him a treaty of alliance which would secure his independence and his friendly_ connection with England.” The Resident, who deemed it inexpedient that Her Majesty’s Government should involve itself in the embarrassments likely to arise from a closer alliance with Bahrein (letter of 25th January 1848), was, however, opposed to making the existing connection closer, as were the Secret Committee of the East India Company, who expressed the view that the Resident “had exercised a wise discretion in not taking any step for the negotiation of a new treaty with Bahrein.” The Resident was, at the same time, authorised, while avoiding discussion with the Turks, to ascertain whether the Sheikh was inclined to enter into a closer connection with Her Majesty’s Govern ment.

VII.—1850 61. Disputes with Wahabis, 1850-51. 60. In 1850 the Resident found it necessary to take disciplinary action against the ruling Sheikh an individual of irresponsible character.’’ Consequent on^ strained relations between the Sheikh and the Wahabi Amir, the Amir, with whom the sons of the ex-Sheikh Abdulla were associated, in 1850-51 threatened Bahrein, whereupon the Sheikh “ against his own better judgment . . . tendered a small annual tribute to the Amir,” a circumstance from which it may perhaps he inferred that he had failed to observe the agreement of 1847 referred to in paragraph 50 above. The Amir rejected the offer and made exorbitant demands instead. The Sheikh was about to succumb to a combination of the sons of the ex-Sheikh and the A ahabi Amir “ when a British squadron arriving off Bahrein took the islands under their protection.” Peace was subsequently made with the Wahabis in July 1851. Her Majesty’s Government and the Claims of Turkey (1851). 61.

In May 1853 the Joveinment of India authorised the Government of Bombay to offer every obstacle to an attack on Bahrein by the Wahabi Lor. 1,887.

Principle of Non-interference in Internal Affairs laid down by Bombay Government (1854). 64. On 20th November 1854 the Government of Bombay in a letter to the Resident laid down the principle of non interference m the internal affairs of Bahrein, and authorised the Resident simultaneously to inform the Sheikh of Qatif on the Arab mainland that the British Government would not tolerate his further interference with the affairs of Bahrein. Slavery Agreement with Her Majesty’s Government (1856). 65. On the 10th May 1856 an agreement supplementary Aitchison to the Treaty of 1847 (paragraph 51 above) regarding the Vol. slave trade was made with the Sheikh. Its contents were No. ix, 234. identical with that of corresponding engagements entered into at the same time by the Arab rulers of the Trucial Coast. 66. The Sheikh’s internal government continued to go from bad to worse. In September 1858 reparation was secured from him for the ill-treatment of British subjects in Bahrein. In 1859 a Wahabi attack was averted by British intervention. The local Wahabi Governor sued for pardon Lor. 1,887. to the Senior Naval Officer; the Wahabi ruler, however, made a formal protest, asserted his authority over Bahrein, and declared that he was himself a vassal of the Sultan of Turkey. The Resident, in reply, informed him of the determination of Her Majesty’s Government to preserve the independence of Bahrein, and pointed out the inconsistency of his piratical attacks on Turkish shipping with his professions of dependence on the Ottoman Government.

The Turkish answer was delayed. A Persian agent (Mirza Mehdi Khan), bearing a Persian Firman to the Sheikh, arrive • s TVr ;i i860 The Persian flag was hoisted, t ersian sovereignty proclaimed, and the Sheikh’s agreement to pay tribute secured. These ceremonies were, however, scarce y over when a Turkish emissary arrived, ihe lersian flag continued to fly during the Sheikh s negotiations with t le Turks but on the latter withdrawing, and subsequently communicating assurances of a character satisfactory to the Sheikh from the Turkish Government, the Turkish flag was hoisted on the forts m place of the j. ersian flag in May 18 and the Sheikh agreed to pay tribute to Turkey, the Persian emissary, however, refused to leave Bahrein or surrender his imaginary authority m the Sheikhdom. ine Resident reported in July 1860 that “the Ottoman flag has now become the national one.” The Sheikh appears to have endeavoured to play off each, party against the othei. Views oj the Minister at Tehran and the Government of Bombay. 68. The Minister at Tehran regarded the matter as one of relatively small importance. He pointed out to the Persian Government “ that under no circumstances can the British Government be expected to concur in the proposed transfer of the sovereignty of Bahrein to the Persian Crown, since we have contracted engagements with the Arab Sheikhs of the island as independent Chiefs, and since the mainten ance of their independence is indispensable to_ the successful working of those plans of maritime police in the Persian Gulf which we have been at so much pains and expense to establish ” ; and obtained an assurance from Persia that no military occupation of Bahrein should be attempted until the title to the island had been settled through the diplomatic channel. He advised the Resident that, while hostilities against Bahrein were to be repelled by force, a voluntary tender of allegiance by the Sheikh to any other Power might, so long as it was unaccompanied by any military occupation, be ignored as of no particular importance. In the light of the Minister’s views the Government of Bombay instructed the Resident that he should not interfere with the occupation of Bahrein, whether by Persia or Turkey, save by protest and by an intimation that the matter had been referred to Her Majesty’s Government; but at the same time that the agents of both Powers (Turkey and Persia) should be warned that aggression by or in the name of Bahrein on neighbour ing tribes would not be allowed and wouid, if necessary, be prevented by force. In representing the matter to the Secretary of State for India they urged that in the interests of the peace of the Gulf it would be better that Bahrein should be regarded as independent and as subject neither to Turkey nor to Persia, that its independence should be recognised, and the engagements into which in the interests of humanity we had entered with its rulers for the preserva tion of the peace and good order of the Gulf should be maintained.

In February 1861 Her Majesty’s Government, after discussion between the India Office and the Foreign Office, approved the recommendation of the Government of Bombay. The Resident and the Minister at Tehran were so informed.

The Sheikh proved obdurate; he was threatened w ith forcible measures by the Resident and two of his ships were seized. He accordingly submitted, and on dlst May 1861 he signed a Friendly Convention with the Resident, acting on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government, by wjneh he entered into a “perpetual treaty of peace and ii lend ship with Great Britain, and in which, as “ indepen dent ruler of Bahrein,” he acknowledged as valid and in force the earlier conventions entered into between Bahrein and Her Majesty’s Government, and undertook in return ° r . a guarantee of protection against aggressions “ by the Chiefs and Iribes of the Gulf ” to abstain from maritime aggression, piracy, the slave trade, &amp;c., and to agree to Aitchison certain conditions in regard to residence and trade in Vol. XI, ’ Bahrein by British subjects and to jurisdiction over them. No - 234 - One of the ships seized from him was thereupon returned; the second, the Hamrah, was retained. 71. The Turkish and Persian agents would seem to have p 0 i. Res. to disappeared from Bahrein before the Resident’s arrival. The Teh., Xo. 20, Persian authorities at Bushire in June 1861 asked the 8-6.1861. Resident for an explanation of his proceedings. The Resident, however, contented himself with forwarding their enquiry to Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. The Convention was • approved by the Government of India in 1861, and the Turkish and Persian Governments were informed of what had happened. Summary, 1850-61. 72. The Turkish Government were informed in 1851 that Her Majesty’s Government could not recognise any claim on their part to Bahrein. The Sheikhs appear to have continued to pay tribute to the Wahabi Amir in the early part of and possibly through out this period. In 1859 the Sheikh appealed simultaneously to Turkey and to Persia, as the result of apprehensions of a Wahabi attack, and received a Persian envoy, who hoisted the Persian flag. On the arrival immediately afterwards of the Turkish envoy the Persian flag was hauled down. Sub sequently the Sheikh for a time flew both flags side by side. The envoys seem to have left Bahrein in the early part of 1861. No action was taken by the British authorities pending a decision by Her Majesty’s Government as to whether they regarded Bahrein as independent. The Persian Government undertook not to endeavour to occupy the islands until the title to them was settled. Her Majesty’s Government decided in February 1861 to regard the Sheikh as an independent ruler and so hold him responsible for piracies, &amp;c. Punitive action against him by Her Majesty’s Government having proved necessary in May 1861, he entered in that month into a convention with them in which he was described as “ independent ruler of Bahrein,” and secured certain guarantees of protection.7 m 20 Lord Cowley to F.O., No, 15, 7.7.1862.

Nature of Relations between Bahrein and Wahabi Amir (1867). 75 In 1866-67 the Resident, on the instructions of the Government of India, investigated the relations of the bheikh of Bahrein and the Wahabi Amir. He reported as a result that the Sheikh claimed to be independent so far as hm islands were concerned, and that the annual tribute oi 4 000 dollars “ which he indubitably paid (cp. paragraph 50 above) to the Amir was on account of the possessions held by him in Qatar on the Arabian mainland, the object oi the payment being to secure those possessions against attacks by Arab tribes under Wahabi influence. The Government o± India in the light of the Resident’s investigation, expressed the view in March 1867 that the Sheikh was independent of all other Powers in respect of his insular possessions and owed fealty to the Wahabis only in regard to Qatar. Summary, 1861-67. 76 This period is marked by assertions of the Persian claim in 1862 and 1866. Her Majesty’s Government on both occasions made it clear that they could not regaid that claim as well founded. /iop-m Investigation showed that the tribute still paid ( ISCn ) by the Sheikh to the Wahabi Amir was in respect of Bahreini possessions on the mainland of Arabia, and not in respect of Bahrein, which the Sheikh held independently of all other Powers. IX.—Discussions and Incidents, 1868-70. 77. Questions of considerable importance as bearing on the status of Bahrein arose in 1868-70 consequent on— (a) the disciplinary action taken by the Government of India against the ruling Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa, in view of his breaches of the Maritime Truce of 1820, which resulted in his flight from Bahrein in September 1868 and the succession as sole Sheikh of his brother, Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa; (5) the punitive action taken at Bahrein by the Govern ment of India in November—December 1869, consequent on the invasion of Bahrein by the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa, the murder of Sheikh21 Bushire Desp. 3 of 25.9.1868. ^’•rAft e , atte “ pt of Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa and S3 K'££“ “ “““ 3 .i.li.trUt’lS p “' *» indicating the view held by Her Maiestv’q T lscussl0na as Ssix't r**? “ -ib.;' S: examine in IZl f fn ® overnmeilt &gt; ^ seems desirable to “ r . ne 1D some detail the correspondence which nasqed and the sequence of events.

An armed expedition was thereupon sent against the Sheikh m August-September of that year. Before it reached ahrem the bheikh fled to the Arab mainland, and he was thereafter regarded by the people of Bahrein and by Her majesty s Government as having abdicated the Sheikhdom. I he expedition found it unnecessary to use any force a full submission being made on its arrival by Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa, brother of Sheikh Mohamed, who had previously been associated with Sheikh Mohamed to some extent in the bbeikhslnp. An agreement was reached by the Political Kesident with Sheikh Ali, which disposed of the matters in dispute, on 6 th September 1868. The agreement was signed bv Ali ^ bin Khalifah and the inhabitants and subjects of Bahrein.” It declared inter alia that “ Md. bin Khalifah having repeatedly committed acts of piracy and other irregularities at sea, and having now, after his recent piiatical acts, fled fiom Bahrein, has forfeited all claim to his title as principal Sheikh and Chief of Bahrein.” 80. Subsequently to the conclusion of this agreement the Resident, by way of punishment, destroyed the fort of Muharraq by gunfire and burnt certain vessels of war belonging to Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifah. His despatch, which contains a detailed report on the course of events,' makes no reference to any flying of the Persian flag by Mohamed bin Khalifah, and the bombardment of Muharraq and the punitive destruction of the warships took place after the submission of Bahrein, and so after Mohamed bin Khalifah had fled from the islands. Persian Protest, November 1868. 81. The facts appear to be as stated in the preceding paragraph. It was some time before a full account of these proceedings reached either India or London. Meanwhile, as will be seen from the correspondence, extracts of which Teh. Desp. are quoted below, the action of the Government of India os m mes drew a vigorous protest from the Persian Government. The 2 ‘ ' x protest, after appealing to the treaties concluded between Teh. Desp. England and Persia in 1809, in 1814, in 1822 (unratified) 149 of and in 1857, urged that the Resident, instead of respecting 17 - 11 - 1868 - the rights of Persia in the Gulf to the extent provided for in those treaties, had, without any prior intimation to the Persian authorities, attacked Bahrein, which island had been and still was the property of Persia ; had bombarded and destroyed the Governor’s fort and house and caused considerable damage ; had appointed the Sheikh’s brother 2953 F Aitch.

The Foreign Office suggested, how ever thatTtmmht he advisable, in the event of similar roceedmgs again becoming necessary, ^t —ication should be had with that Government. Wblle thl '^ ea ^ was still under consideration f Resident’s action was received (l ith Februaiy 1869) f the Persian Charge d’Affaires m London, who complame inter alia, that the Resident had sunk three ships belonging to the Governor of Bahrein and fired on his palace on which the Persian flag flew, and requested that the British Govern ment would give orders for the repair of the damage causec . He was informed in reply that “ the Sheikh of Bahreinivas an independent chief with whom the British Government had treaty engagements and whom they must hold strictly to the performance of those engagements. n 83 This contention the Persian representative disputed and in support of his view he forwarded letters addressed “ from 1838 to 1869 by the Sheikh of Bahrein to His Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Prince Governor of Shiraz. 1 he translations of these letters are dated 9th Apnl and 12th April 1869 respectively. From internal evidence it seems orobable that they were, however, written in 186U on the occasion of the visit to Bahrein of the Persian envoy Mirza Mehdi Khan (paragraph 67 above). They acknowledge the receipt of a Firman from the Mirza (apparently recognising Sheikh Md. as Sheikh and accompanying a Firman and a Sword of Honour for Sheikh Ali). They state emphatically that Bahrein forms part of Persia, and has always done so. They refer to an agreement reached for the future payment of tribute; remark that “ the slight neglect which was latelv shown on our part towards Your Imperial Majesty s Government was because they had not foi a while superin tended and protected us, but as now the Government of Your Imperial Majesty has intended by sending over Mirza Mehdy to enquire into and manage the affairs here, I, with my brother and all the inhabitants, feel quite ready to declare at once that we are most willing to render any services required from us towards Your Majesty’s Government, being already aware that Bahrein (Persian Gulf) is part of Persia,” and add “ . . .

The question of the reply to be given to this further protest was carefully considered between the India Office and the Foreign Office. The Duke of Argyll, then Secretary of State for India, remarked that although he was of opinion that the line of policy which had hitherto been pursued of regarding the Sheikh of Bahrein as an independent sovereign, and of refusing to recognise the right of sovereignty advanced by Persia, as had been done in 1845, 1848 and 1860, could not now be abandoned without very serious risk of endangering the peace of the Gulf, yet that “ l ie was not blind to the expediency of avoiding all causes of unnecessary irritation at the Court of Tehran and that23 as a^Ue^of’coSy desire i‘. instructions to the Government ^“1 ^ en J me ^’ t0 issue Resident in the PerslT^h^^ at teS Und T 0rderS from Illdia &gt; be about to caU tn?s w th the RnV ^ 0 p a0Cmmt any breach of his engage Britt^tistL ot 0 V ?' m T n y J 0 cotil &gt; *0 fact to the Government 61 ctumt te f^rh ^ 11 ° f Shah ’ S r“5,vtfsr u ' responsibHitv and 1 t0 P 10111 ? 41 ? °n his own not wdl ni M’ d u UC , h CaSeS the 8 e oretai 7 of State was not willing to waive what he considered “as not only a nVht Govemmfnt 4 ” TheF dU - ty i?ffi Umbent U P 0D ’ the ” British Mohs™' and tho Pp ’• T Foieign Office concurred m these views Khan, ana tho Persian representative was informed accordingly. 29 . 4 . 1869 .

The text (oimttmg an introductory paragraph) of the amended letter, which is of importance as one of the principal pieces of evidence subsequently adduced by the Persian Government m support of their claim that Her Majesty’s Government have recognised Persian sovereignty over Bahrein, is as Tbe sentences in italics are those which were added in deference to the further representations from General Mohsin Khan referred to above : — “ The British Government i^eadily admit that the Government of the Shah has protested against the Persian 7'ight of sovereignty over Bahrein being ignored by the British Authorities, and they have given due consideration to that protest. But it is the fact, as yourself and the Government of the Shah are un doubtedly aware, that the Sheikhs of Bahrein have at different periods entered directly into engagements with the British Government; and I beg to assure you that the British Government hold the Sheikh to these engagements solely for the purposes of preventing Piracy and Slave Trade, and of maintaining the police of the Gulf. If the Persian Government are prepared to keep a sufficient force in the Gulf for these purposes, this country would be relieved of a troublesome and costly duty; but, if the Shah is not prepared to undertake these duties, Her Majesty’s Government cannot suppose His Majesty would wish that in those waters disorder and crimes should be encouraged by impunity. “ I need scarcely assure you of the friendly feelings entertained by Her Majesty’s Government towards Persia, and their desire on all occasions to meet as far as possible the wishes of the Shah ; and, in regard to this question, I have the honour to state to you that, whenever it is practicable to do so, Her Majesty’s Government will cause the Persian Government to be informed beforehand of any measures of coercion against himself which the conduct of the Sheikh of Bahrein may have rendered necessary. “But the British Government cannot consent to debar its officers, to whom the superintendence of the police of24 Pol.

Her Majesty’s Minister further reported that “ All bin Kbalifa having forwarded letters to this uo i t admitting his allegiance to the Shah and offermg his services- to the Persian Government, an agent iMuza Mehdi Phan, who had been Persian Envoy to Bahrein in 18o9 (para- cranh 67 above)) bad been despatched with a Royal firman, recognising Sheikh Ali bin Khalifah as Chief of Bahrein but that on receipt of the new T s of the murder of the blu ik by the ex-Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifah, the Turman had been recalled and the name of the ex-Sheikh substituted (from paragraphs 94-5 below it will be seen that these statements subsequently proved to be incorrect in material particulars,.

Punitive operations consequent on the murder of Sheikh Ali were undertaken by the British Government in November of the same year. Previous notification was given to the Persian Government of the grounds of this expedition, the object of which was stated to be &lt;k to call the cbiei now in possession of Bahrein to account for his breach of the maritime peace and for the attack on Sheikh Ali bin Khalifah, who had been placed in power by the British Government.' ^ 89. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on receipt of the notification in question stated that the ex-Sneikh Mohammed bin Kbalifab, who had, he said, been the cause of the recent disturbances, had been killed (this was in fact incorrect); that the Resident’s action would therefore be useless, and that the Persian Government hoped that he would be telegraphically instructed not to proceed to Bahrein. He added that the Persian Government would themselves keep the affairs of Bahrein by land in order and that should anything happen to affect its affairs by sea they would request Idle British Government to send a naval force to put affairs in order, “ but up till now the state of affairs in Bahrein had not fallen into disorder. 90.

Persian Protest, 1869-70. Views of Government of India. 92. 1 he Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs appears at first to have received news of the removal of the ex-Sheikh with equanimity and is said to have remarked that Persia anti Gieat Liitain had an equal interest in the maintenance of peace by sea and that Persia had therefore no reason to object to the punishment of the delinquent. But he protested in strong terms against the Resident’s action in preventing the Persian agent from landing and holding communication with the Sheikh, and a stiil stronger protest was made by the Persian Minister in London. The Govern ment of India, in the exhaustive reports they submitted on the Resident’s action, urged, after a review of the history of the islands, that the Shah had no legitimate control over the Sheikh of Bahrein ; that his Government had nevertheless encouraged the piratical faction in the Persian Gulf by sending letters of recognition to the piratical leader; that in styling Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah Chief of Bahrein the Persian Government ignored the facts that he had never held sway in Bahrein, belonged to the younger branch of the ruling family, and so had neither by right nor possession claim to this title; and that, so far from the Shah having any just cause of complaint against the Resident, the Persian Government should be called upon to give some explanation of the conduct of its officers in encouraging a piratical expedition which was prejudicial to British interests in the Persian Gulf and for the successive appointment by them of Ali bin Khalifa and Md. bin Khalifa to the sovereignty of a district over which they had no legitimate control. The Government of India added that they had no confirmation of the alleged overtures of Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa to Persia (paragraph 87 above), as to which further enquiry was being made of Her Majesty’s Minister 295 ^ G Bushire Desp. 216 of 15.12.1869.

Reply to Persia, March 1870. 93. Her Majesty’s Minister was therefore instructed by the Foreign Office that it appeared possible that_ Her Majesty s Government, instead of furnishing explanations to 1 ersia, might have cause to complain “ of the proceedings oi ^he Persian authorities in endeavouring to communicate with a piratical chief who had been guilty of a breach of the Mari time Truce, and who had attacked the Chief placed in power at Bahrein by the British Government,’ and was informed that no notice would be taken of the complaints against the Resident until the Persian Government gave a full explana- nf ttip. int.prceoted letters. Supplementary Eeports by Her Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, ^ April 1870. 94. On 6 th April 1870 the Minister at Tehran reported as follows to the Government of India : — “ In my Despatch No. 81 ... I reported that the Firman of appointment was originally in the name of Ali bin Khalifa, but that, on hearing of his death, it was altered in favour of his brother, Aid. bin Khalifa. This information had reached me from a relation of one of the principal Persian officials in Shiraz, and not . . . from the Persian Alinister for Foreign Affairs. AYhen further intelligence reached Shiraz from the Gulf and it was supposed that Aid. bin. Abdullah would retain possession of Bahrein, the Firman was probably again altered in his favour, as it was to him that it was eventually forwarded. In conversation with the Persian Alinister this afternoon His Excellency admitted that this was probably the case. He said that Alirza Mehdi Khan on leaving Tehran had received general instructions for his guidance respecting the Bahrein question, but that the details were settled at Shiraz and the Firman was issued in the name of the Persian Governor of Fars and not in that of the Shah. The name inserted in this document had certainly, he said, been altered once to his knowledge, and it was not unlikely that it had been changed a second time before being forwarded to its destination. “ With regard to the overtures said to have been made by Ali bin Khalifa to the Persian Government, as reported in my Despatch No. 81, I have the honour to state that that information also reached me from a private source and not from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. His Excellency has, however, asserted very positively to me to-day that Ali bin Khalifa had repeatedly written to the Persian Government professing allegiance to the Shah and that a number of letters containing assurances of this kind are now in his (the Alinister’s) possession. “ It appears to me that on the receipt of a correspon dence which passed last April between Her Alajesty’s Government and the Shah’s representative in London, the Persian Ministers, believing that the Bahrein Chief was himself well disposed to further their designs, resolved to take measures with a view to establishing, if possible, the Shah’s authority in that quarter and make good his claim to exercise sovereign rights over Bahrein. Alirza Mehdi Khan was accordingly dispatched to Shiraz and Bushire and a certain latitude was given to him as to the mode in which he should proceed to carry out the wishes of his Government. The Persian authorities in Shiraz finally determined that a Firman should be addressed to Aid. bin Abdullah, conferring27 the KhricfrrabTot 0 ' Balirein aud With ‘his Chief then if polselon'^oftrplacV^B^'^ l he matter the sole obiept nf nil 6 ^ ut 111 this have been to carry Out the nolfOT C p ™ ed D would seem to ment at Bahrein without ^ p Persian Govern- 9 r G r~ ^ w or the following despatch to theGo^eraSent of Ma®-' 6886 * 1 in which I^tatedTh^ 0 i? y M eS P atch ° f the 6th instant, m vnicn i stated that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed me that Ali bin Khalifa had fene rtedlv made overtures to Persia nrlmittd^-r- lclu . ie P ecUe my Shah, I have the honour to “ port tr^Yn^T 6 If * he that Mirza Sayed Khan^ InTLtVhfo “tS he was mistaken m making this assertion, and that he hnds on enquiry that the letters to which he referred leie not fiom that Chief, but from Md. bin Khalifa.” oc mPT ^ Government of India, May 1870. remarked thm CH MT7 U in f India ’ co “t“gon these facts, with n d th f i 1 hd • Khan a PP eare( l to have left Tehran with a general discretion as to which of the various Sheikhs should be recognised as ruler. “ At the capital no more definite plan appears to have been resolved on than that measures should be adopted to establish the Sheikh’s assumed right of sovereignty over the island.” 97. The Government of India proceeded that they had already pomted out that any disposition to admit the claims of Persia would probably lead to the revival of similar claims on the part of Turkey, a result which had in fact now been Drought about (cp. paragraph 99 below). “ This (i e the Turkish) claim rests on no better foundation than that • {ersm. It was summarily rejected by Lord Palmerston an ISof and m our opinion should not again be reopened VVitli equal reason the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan of Muscat could claim the sovereignty of the island, if the nominal and temporary tender of allegiance, in times of difficulty, and as a security against foreign intervention, be considered sufficient ground on which to base such preten sions. On the same ground indeed we might claim Bahrein as a part of the British dominions. But, as we have repeatedly observed, the real status of the island, and the only one which we have recognised and admitted, or are prepared to recognise and admit, in all our dealings in the Persian Gulf and our negotiations with the Chiefs, is that of an independent State, subject neither to Persia nor to Turkey, neither to the Wahabis nor to Muscat, nor yet to the British Government.” Gr. of I. Desp. No. 28 of 20.5.1870. Review of Discussions of 1868-70. 98. The matter ultimately lapsed. But from the facts and the correspondence summarised above it will lie seen, in the first place, that there appears to be no foundation for the alleged overtures to Persia by the ruling Sheikh, Ali bin Khalifa, or for the statement that the Persian flag was flying at the time of the punitive expedition of 1868 ; and that if any overtures were made to Persia in 1868-69 (and there is no confirmatory evidence of any such overtures) they would appear to have been made by the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa, presumably in his anxiety to secure Persian support for his restoration. Secondly, while the statements contained in the Note sent by the Foreign Office on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government to the Persian Charge d’Affaires on 29th April 1869 were widely phrased, and afford some justification for the interpretation placed on them by Persia, and while the Persians may have been confirmed in their view by the absence of any protest by Her Majesty’s Minister against the mission of Mirza Mehdi Khan, the terms of that Note do not, in fact, constitute more than a recognition that28 there by the British Government.

British Assurances to Bahrein, 1871. 100 In 1871 the Turks occupied Hasa. Protests at Constantinople'in April and May 1871 against rumoured Turkish designs on Bahrein resulted in a repudiation by Turkey of any such designs. The assurances received from the Turkish Government were communicated to the Sheikh of Bahrein, who had asked Her Majesty’s Government for their advice and their protection against the Turks m Lor.

Protests about the same time at Constantinople led to a Turkish repudiation of the designs which the Turkish Lor. I, 919. Government were alleged to have entertained at Bahrein, and the Turkish authorities in Hasa were given instructions by their Government which debarred them from approaching Bahrein. In May 1871 the Shah enquired from Her Majesty’s Representative at Tehran as.to the probable effect on Bahrein of the Turkish occupation of Hasa and was informed in reply of the assurances which had been given to Her Majesty’s Government by the Turks.

In November 1871 the Secretary of the Persian Legation at Constantinople made enquiries of Her Majesty’s Ambassador in connection with a rumour that a Turkish expedition was to be sent for the reduction of Bahrein, “ which island the Persian Secretary stated had been acknowledged by the British Government as a portion of Hertslet, 28. the Persian dominions and ... in proof of this assertion he had handed to Sir H. Elliott a copy of the note which 1 Lord Clarendon addressed to General Haji Mobsin Khan on 1513.1872. 28th April 1869. Sir H.

Consequent on the murder of a Turkish messenger m Bahrein m August or September 1871, the Turkish krovernment demanded reparation direct from the Sheikh and received a conciliatory reply. On their demand being- pressed the Sheikh, on the advice of the Resident, suggested that me matter be arranged between the British and the lurkish Governments, by whose joint decision he would abide, but the Turkish Government preferred that it should be settled direct by the parties by agents. Her Majesty’s Government saw no objection to such a procedure so long as no compulsion or show of force by Turkey was involved! The Turks, however, let the matter drop, the incident is of some interest as illustrating the view taken by Her Majesty s Government of the bheikh as an independent ruler who might deal direct with foreign Powers. 104. In August 1872, a further complaint having been received from Turkey of British proceedings in regard to Bahrein and the commission of “acts of sovereignty” on F.O. to the part of the English, the Ambassador w r as informed in Turkish reply that enquiries would be made into the point raised by him and that his Government might rest assured that it was HertsGt 30 not the intention of Her Majesty’s Government to interfere * in the affairs of the Persian Gulf beyond what was imposed Io °7 187^°'’ upon them by treaty for the preservation of peace in the waters. The Ambassador,was finally informed in April 1873, after investigation, that there were no grounds what ever for the statement that the British Government had attempted to exercise acts of sovereignty over Bahrein. 105. In 1874, consequent on a Turkish claim to conscript Bahreinis resident in Basra, the Turkish Ambassador in London w r as referred to the British Notes of 1851 and 1870 (paragraphs 61 and 99 above), which stated that Her Majesty’s Government did not admit the claims of Turkey to consider Bahrein as part of the Ottoman dominions. In the same year, on a piratical attack being made on the island by certain Bahreini exiles who had signed a petition claiming Turkish protection, the Ambassador at Constan tinople handed a memorandum to the Porte in which it was stated that Her Majesty’s Government could not recognise any rights or pretensions of the Porte over Bahrein. In 1875 a rumour that Her Majesty’s Government were forti fying Bahrein led to representations from Turkey. The Lor. I, 914 rumour was unfounded and the Turks w r ere so informed. On its becoming known about the same time that the Turks Lor. I, 915. themselves contemplated building a lighthouse on the island, the British Government entered a protest at Constantinople (October 1875), with the result that the project was abandoned. 106. In 1876, consequent on steps taken by the Turkish authorities to enforce the claims of Qatar merchants against Bahreinis, a Note was addressed to the Porte reminding them of the determination of Her Majesty’s Government to protect Bahrein against any attack on its independence. 107. In 1879-80 the Turkish Government took up the cause of the rebels of 1869. Her Majesty’s Government, after again disclaiming the exercise of sovereignty over Lor. 1,915. Bahrein, which they regarded, they said, as independent, promised to make enquiries as to certain acts of which com- plaint was made by petitioners to the Turkish Government. 2953 ‘ H30 Aitchison, Yol. XI, No. xxii, 237. First Exclusive Agreement between Her Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh of Bahrem (1880). 108. In 1880 the Political Resident, finding that the Sheikh was disposed to conclude a special arrangement with the British Government, entered on the 22nd December into what is known as the First Exclusive Agreement with him By this Agreement the Sheikh undertook on heha o himself and his “ successors in the Government of Bahrein to the British Government to abstain from entering into negotiations or making treaties of any sort with any State or Government other than the British without the consent of the said British Government, and to refuse permission to any other Government than the British to ^ establish diplomatic or consular agencies or coaling depots m our territory, unless with the consent of the British Government. This engagement does not apply to or affect the customary friendly correspondence with the local authorities^ of neighbouring States on business of minor impoitance. The agreement was approved by Her Majesty s Government and ratified in 1881. Summary, 1870-80. 109. The claims of the Wahabi Amir disappear with the subjugation of Hasa by the Turks in 1871. I he Turkish claim was repeatedly pressed during this period and was consistently rejected by Her Majesty s Government. The Persian claim appears to have been dormant. Her Majesty’s Government repudiate suggestions that they have committed “ acts of sovereignty ” and continue to express their view that the Sheikh is an independent ruler. In 1880 the Sheikh entered into his first exclusive agreement with Her Majesty’s Government. XI.—1880-92. From the conclusion of the First to the conclusion of the Second Exclusive Agreement with Her Majesty’s Government. Persian Demarche, 1886. 110. In September 1886 the Shah sent a verbal message to Her Majesty’s Government through the Minister at Tehran that he considered the communication made to him in April 1869 as tantamount to an admission of his rights in Bahrein and that he was anxious to establish his authority effectually over the islands either by sending a Governor to Bahrein or possibly by recognising the Sheikh as representative of Persian authority, but that he wished the maritime police to remain in the hands of the British authorities. An answer was prepared by Her Majesty’s Government to the effect that they did not concur in His Majesty’s interpretation of the communication of April 1869. They had treaty engage ments with the Sheikh, whom they considered to be indepen dent, and must hold the Sheikh to his engagements while fulfilling those they had contracted towards him. As, however, the Shah did not return to the subject, the message was not delivered. 111. In the same year presents sent from the Persian Governor of Ear to the Sheikh were returned to the sender. 112. In 1887-88 Persian intrigues took place with a view to the establishment of Persian influence on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf. These were of little importance in the case of Bahrein, but it may be recorded that it appears that in the case of that principality the Persian Government had sanctioned a scheme for the seizure of Bahrein by Sheikh Lor. 1,920 Jasim of Dohah in Qatar, who had seemingly undertaken to put the Persians in possession of the Sheikhdom.

In November 1892 the Ottoman Government were Const. Desp. warned (apropos of the position of Bahreinis at Basra) that No. 348 of Bahiem was under British protection, and that no interference •^•11.1892. with its natives by the Ottoman authorities could be admitted. In the same year the Porte was informed, with reference to a rumoured intention to land Turkish troops, that such action would be opposed by Her Majesty’s ships. Summary, 1880-92. 116. The Turkish claim was again pressed vigorously during this period and was consistently rejected by Her Majesty’s Government. The Shah raised the question of the Persian claim in 1886, but did not press the matter. In 1892 the Sheikh entered into his Second Exclusive Agreement with Her Majesty’s Government. XII.—1892-1913.

The views of Her Majesty’s Government on the status of the island were again officially repeated at Constantinople on two occasions in 1896. In 1897 the Constantinople Board of Health proposed to establish a sanitary post in Bahrein. The proposal was abandoned on the objections of the British delegate, who represented that Bahrein was an independent principality under British protection. 118. In 1898 a Turkish request that a British Vice- Consul alleged to have been appointed at Bahrein should32 6 . Telx. De p.

In 1899 the Minister at Tehran informed the French representative at that capital that since 1880 the Sheikh was precluded by treaty irom holding direct relations with any Power other than Her Majesty’s Government and that his subjects abroad we re now under British protection. 119. A native British Agent had for a long period of years been maintained in Bahrein In 1900 a British Political Agent was appointed at Bahrein 1 he post has been maintained since that date, and has been n ec w an officer of the Indian Political Department since 1904. The Incident of 1901. 120. On 31st August 1901 a Belgian customs official in Lor I 935- the service of the Persian Government visited Bahrein, where he called on the Sheikh and informed him that he had been deputed by the Shall to obtain his consent to place Persian custom officials in Bahrein. An official protest was at once made by His Majesty s Minister to the Peisian Government, in the course oi which Sir A. Haidinge remarked that no intimation had been given to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf “ of this Persian mission to an Arab State under British protection and bound by special treaties, of which the Persian Government . cannot be ignorant, to the Government of India ... It is my duty to place on record in the clearest manner that His Majesty the Emperor of India cannot acquiesce in any foreign interference in the affairs of Bahrein . . . and that any attempt to disturb the relations established by treaties of long standing between those Chiefs and the Government of India will be regarded as an unfriendly act.” The Attabeg- i-Azam, in a note received on the I7th September 1901, replied : “ As I have told you verbally, M. Simais has had no instructions from the Persian Government on this matter, and if there have been any steps on his part it must have been by mistake and he will be reprimanded for it.” The Disokdeks of 1904-05. 121. In 1904-05, consequent on a series of attacks on Persians and on German subjects in Bahrein, the Persians appealed to the Shah. The Persian Government replied that His Majesty’s Government w r ould take action on their behalf. The text of their telegram was as follows : “ To the Merchants and Traders of the High Government living in Bahrein. Your telegram on the subject of the assaults which have been made upon you by the Arab roughs of Bahrein has been received. Certainly let your minds be at rest. Con sultations with the English Legation have taken place on this subject, and it will shortly be settled in such a way that the oppression will be removed and that the offenders will receive their proper punishment.” 122. The Germans complained to the German Vice- Consul at Bushire, who made a direct request to the Sheikh for reparation, in reply to which he was referred by His Excellency to His Majesty’s Government. The Sheikh was ultimately compelled by His Majesty’s Government to give redress. Turkish Protest, 1904-05. 123.

He was reminded jn Plat agreement had been expressly disavowed by His Majesty s Government and that Captain Bruce had been recalled. In a supplementary note the Grand Vizier’s attention was drawn to the fact that the then Shah himself 7ol&gt;o re recognise ” the stipulations of the Treaty of ’.which had never been ratified, and had u expressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz should have entered into any engagements with the British Government without his knowledge or instructions.” H 6 . On the Ala-es-Sultaneh reviving the Persian claim, on the ground of the Agreement of 1822, in August 1907’ his attention was drawn in a Note dated 13th August 1907 to the Notes referred to in the preceding paragraph; and to the fact that the Agreement had been disavowed alike by His Majesty’s Government and by the Shah. The Note added that ‘since 1822 the Turkish Government have raised claims on Bahrein, and, like the Persian Govern ment, have been informed that Bahrein is under British protection.” 127. In 1908 the Persian Government, in a correspondence regarding the punishment of a Bahrein subject at Lingah, intimated that instructions had been sent to Lingah that reparation should be made, but added that His Majesty’s Minister would admit that “ the proprietary right of the Persian Government over the island is not a matter to be disputed.” The Note was returned as inadmissible to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

On 29th July 1913 His Majesty’s Government signed a convention (which still awaited ratification on the outbreak of the War of 1914-18) with the Ottoman Govern ment, under which that Government renounced all their claims to the islands of Bahrein, the independence of which they recognised. His Majesty’s Government on their part declared that they had no intention of annexing the islands and undertook not to allow the Sheikh of Bahrein to disturb the autonomy of the peninsula of El Katr or to annex it, and to ensure that the Sheikh should not discriminate against Ottoman subjects in the matter of dues levied upon pearl fisheries. The Turkish Government on their side accepted a reservation of the right of the population of Bahrein to visit Zakhnuniyah Island for fishing, and recognised the rights of subjects of the Sheikh to British consular protection in Turkey. This arrangement, followed, as it was, by the disappearance of Turkey from the Gulf after the War of 1914-18, disposed of the Turkish claim to Bahrein, which had been reasserted on numerous occasions and with great insistence since 1847. Summary, 189^-1913. 130. The Turkish claim was repeatedly raised during the early part of this period, but consistently opposed by His Majesty’s Government. It was finally abandoned in the (unratified) Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 1913. While that Convention was never ratified, the abandonment of the Turkish claim was confirmed by Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausaune of 1923. The Persian claim was also frequently pressed and was consistently repudiated in strong terms by His Majesty’s Government. Xin.—1913-34. Exercise of Jurisdiction over Eoreigners by British Agent in Bahrein. 131. In virtue of the Convention of 1861 (paragraph 70 P.G.13, §8,p. 62. above) and of subsequent delegations by the Sheikhs, the § 10 , p. 63. British Representative in Bahrein has for over 70 years35 exercised important judicial powers in the islands. The Sheikh in l.)09-l^ formally requested His Majesty’s guers in -- ills Government to exercise jurisdiction over forei Bahrein other than the subjects of Arab potentates. An Order m Conned conferring such jurisdiction on the Political Agent was made in 1913. It was supplemented by a further Order m 1922. Since 1920 jurisdiction over all foreign subjects has rested with the British authorities within the limits of the Orders in Council. lo-,. dhe Sheikh, on I4th May 1914, undertook not to entertain. any overtures for an oil concession save after consultation with the Political Agent and with the approval of His Majesty’s Government. Undertakings secured from Ibn Saud, December 1915. 133. In 1915 His Majesty’s Government, in entering into an Agreement with Ibn Saud, then ruler of Nejd, secured an undertaking from him “to refrain from all aggression on, or interference with the territories of . . . Bahrein. ...” Persian Claim reasserted, 1922-23. 134. In 1922 His Majesty’s Consul at Bunder Abbas reported that the Persian passport officials at Lingah had ruled that Bahreinis were Persian subjects and should be given Persian passports. They seized two British certificates of identity granted to Bahrein subjects, but on representa tions being made by the Minister at Tehran instructions were given by the Central Government that there was to be no repetition of this incident. In 1922, also, the Persian delegate at a Postal Conference held at Bushire stated that while not for the moment pressing for the transfer to Persia of the Bahrein post office, his action was without prejudice to the Persian claim to Bahrein. 135. In 1923, consequent on a Press campaign and a discussion in the Majliss on the desirability of giving Bahrein the right to return a member to the Persian Parlia ment, which was referred to a Commission for report, His Majesty’s Government decided that it was desirable to address a formal Note to the Persian Government in terms similar to those employed in 1906 (paragraph 124 above). Owing to the difficult internal situation in Persia this proposal was dropped, but in September 1923 the Persian Government was informed that the island was now a British protectorate, and that His Majesty’s Government did not contemplate any alteration of its status. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that the Government of which he was a member had no intention of laying claim to Bahrein on behalf of Persia. But despite this statement the Minister for Foreign Affairs again reverted to the question in the following month. His Majesty’s Government remove Sheikh Isa for Misgovermnent (1923). 136. Consequent on the gross misgovernment of Sheikh Isa, who had been ruler of Bahrein since 1869, the Sheikh was deprived by His Majesty’s Government of his control of affairs in Bahrein on 26th May 1923, and was granted an allowance, his son, Sheikh Hamad (whose right of succession had been recognised by His Majesty’s Government in 1901) being appointed to act for him “as his father’s fully empowered agent.” Oil concession granted by Sheikh, 1925. 137. In 1925 an oil concession was granted by the -Sheikh of Bahrein to the Eastern and General Syndicate, a British corporation, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government. 483 ' Aitch., XI, Xo. xvi, 239.

Consequent thereon, a strong protest was received on 26th November 1927 from the Persian Government, copies of which were despatched to the League of .Nations, lie Persian protest was based essentially on the recognition stated to have been accorded to Persian sovereignty over Bahrein in Lord Clarendons Lote ol 29th April 1869 (paragraph 85 above). A reasoned reply to the 1 ersian Note was despatched by His Majesty’s Government on 18th January 1928, and circulated to the League. _ While avoiding any definite statement as to theii ov r n position in Bahrein or its basis, His Majesty’s Government m their Note repudiated the Persian claim in the strongest terms, and intimated that no argument such as was suggested could be based on the communication of 29th April 1869. Attitude of Sheikhs to Persian claim (1928). 139. The Sheikhs of Bahrein, on being apprised of the revival of Persia’s claim, gave a letter to the Political Resident, requesting His Majesty’s Government in accordance P 1409/28. with their treaties “ to defend Bahrein from outside inter ference ” and to act as their agents in rebutting the Persian claims, and intimating that the Sheikhs proposed to send Sheikh Mohamed, brother of Sheikh Hamad, the deputy ruler, and son of the deposed ruler, Isa, as their representative in answering the claim should the case be taken to Geneva. Further Persian Protest, 2nd August 1928. 140. On the 2nd August 1928 the Persian Government P. 4184/28. communicated a lengthy and reasoned reply to the British Note of 18th January 1928. The Note based its reiteration of the Persian claim on the principle that territory belonging to a sovereign State could definitely be detached from that State only with the consent of the State in question, which had not been given in the case of Bahrein ; and alleged that the terms of the Foreign Office Note of 29th April 1869 were con clusive evidence of the view then held of the rights of Persia by His Majesty’s Government; that Bahrein had consistently recognised Persian sovereignty, as could be proved by documentary evidence, up to the date when the Sheikhs were instigated to rebellion by a foreign government; that no valid argument could be founded on the direct relations into which the Sheikhs had entered with His Majesty’s Govern ment, since their action had been without the approval of their suzerain ; that the relations of Bahrein with Persia were more highly developed than with any other independent civilised country; that the Persian claim had been con sistently and uninterruptedly pressed ; and finally that even if the Treaty of 1822 was disavowed by His Majesty’s- Government, it was material evidence of the view held by a British officer of great experience at the time of its con clusion, and that its disavowal by the then Shah of Persia was not because of any doubt on his part as to the true status of Bahrein. P. 1640/29. 141. A reasoned reply, which examined in detail the arguments put forward by the Persian Government and reached the conclusion that they w r ere without substance, was despatched and circulated to the League at the request, of His Majesty’s Government on 18th February 1929.■37 pf 484 Persian claim was worthless, and that while they would gladly see it finally disposed of as part of a general settlement, they would not be prepared to make any specific concession in return for its abandonment. Various formulae were worked out m discussion between His Majesty’s Representatives in 1 eiiran and tne Tepresentatives of the Persian Government witn a view to an agreed solution. The negotiations have, however, failed^ to reach any conclusion and are at the moment suspended without any prospect of early resumption. 144. In 1932 the Persian Government protested to His P.Z. 4902/33 Majesty’s Government against the issue of British Indian postage stamps surcharged “ Bahrein,” and repeated their protest to the League. Their protest was rejected by His Majesty’s Government, and the stamps issued in August 1933. On 22nd May 1934 a further protest against the operation of the Bahrein oil concession was addressed by P.Z. 4343/34 the Persian Government to the United States Minister at Tehran, the United States Government and His Majesty’s Government, and copies were circulated at the request of Persia to the League of Nations. His Majesty’s Government propose to reply to this communication in a Note drawing attention to their Notes of January 1928 and February 1929 and to request the League of Nations to circulate this reply to the States Members of the League. XIV.—Conclusion. 145. It may be convenient in concluding this memoran dum on the recent history of Bahrein to summarise very briefly the claims to sovereignty over the island which, have been advanced by various countries since 1783 ; the particular basis of those claims in the case of Persia (whose claim is alone at the present time of any importance); and the basis and development of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government.

The Turkish claim was finally withdrawn in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. lhat Convention was never ratified, but the withdrawal of the claim was confirmed by Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923. (e) Persia. —The Persian claim lias been consistently urged on a variety of occasions through the period m question. The Sheikhs momentarily submitted themselves to Persia in 1799 and paid tribute. In 1816-17 they received a Persian envoy and apparently appealed tor help to Tehran. They again momentarily submitted to Persia and received an envoy in 1839. Persian aid was invoked and a Persian emissary received at Bahrein in 1860-61, while in 1869 the deposed ex-Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa may have made overtures to Persia (though there is no confirmation of this) to enable him to re-establish his control over the island. The Persian claim appears, apart from this, to have been asserted in 1822, 1825, 1844, 1848, 1861, 1862, 1866, 1868, 1869,1886, 1901, 1905, 1906, 1907, 1910, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1932-33 and 1934, and to have been rejected by His Majesty’s Goyeminent in 1822 (as part of their refusal to accept Captain Bruce’s Treaty), 1825, 1844,1848, 1861,1862, 1866-67,1869, 1901,1906, 1907, 1908-09, 1923, 1928, 1929, 1933 and 1934. B.—Basis of the Persian Claim. 147. Ignoring contentions such as that the use of the term “ Persian Gulf ” is a recognition of Persian sovereignty over the various islands of the Gulf, Persia has at one time or other based her claim on the nine grounds examined below :— (1) History of the Islands 'prior to 1783. The history of the islands prior to the expulsion of the Persians in 1783 is dealt with in paragraphs 3 to 5 above. It will be seen that at various periods since the beginning of the Christian era, Persia has exercised a degree of control over the islands, and in particular that during the 30 years prior to 1783 her control was of a more definite character. On the other hand, the facts recorded above do not support any claim by Persia to an uninterrupted occupation or control of the islands.the^arlyhSorv ^rT ° CCa - sions in the Past appealed to cne early History o± Bahrein in support of her claim tW p 18 - lllstoricall y Persian territory. Since 1930, too, certain Pei sian newspapers, presumably inspired have dpilf- of consKlerable length with the history of Bahrein in the more 01 less iemote past, and have supported their statement by quotations from, or references to, Arab or Persian geographers or historians. Owing to the absence of records and the shortness of time available, it has been impossible researches iSo thTr n v tS m f d A eta ! 1 ’ or to conduct elaborate researcnes into the writings of Arab geographers and others from which further information might be secured But it is arguable that the position of the islands prior to U83 s at most only of very indirect importance in the presen? connection. I he essential weakness in the Persian claim is it is suggested, that there has been no effecBve exerc s^ in islands by Persia since her expulsion m In So, and that the Sneikhs, who originally established emselves by conquest, have now acquired a prescriptive title based on an uninterrupted occupation of 150 vears by the present ruling family. J (2) The Absence of Persian Consent to the Detachment of Bahrein from Persia. lA Persian Government, in paragraph 2 of their Note . ~ ri ' 11 A ' 1 - 1 st 19-8 (Appendix B), invited attention to tne lollowing^ international juridical principle. ... A territory belonging to a sovereign State cannot be lawfully detached so long as the right of ownership has not been transferred by this State to another State in virtue of an official act, in this case a treaty, or so long as its annexation by another State or its independence have not been officially recognised by the lawful owner of the territory.” They added (correctly) that Persia has never renounced her sovereignty or ceded it to another State or ever recognised any of the Sheikhs of Bahrein as independent rulers. I he argument put forward by the Persian Government undei this head is examined in detail in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Note despatched by the Foreign Office on 18th February 1929 in reply to the Persian Note of 2nd August 1928 (Appendix B). His Majesty’s Govern ment ^ expressed their inability to agree that any such principle^ if alleged to be of universal application, formed part of international law. The deciding factor in the question of international title in cases in which territory has effectively established its independence of the former sovereign is the effective establishment by that territory of its independence, “and in the case of Bahrein His Majesty’s Government regard as wholly untenable the pro position that effective possession and administration by the present ruling family for 145 years, during which these rulers have been independent of Persia and during which no Persian authority has been exercised in their dominions, can be affected by the mere consideration that the Persian Government have not set their signature to a document formally recognising the fact of their independence.” In paragraph 7 of the same Note His Majesty’s Government cite historical precedents to show that the theory of the necessity for the formal consent of the dispossessed State is not one which has ever obtained international acceptance. (3) The Unratified Treaty of 1822. The circumstances in which the Treaty of 1822 was concluded by Captain Bruce with the representative of the Prince Governor of Shiraz are set out in paragraphs 20-21 above. As will be seen, Captain Bruce concluded it without40 ■f the ;mthority o£ or reference to Government. The treaty Sto which he had entered was immediately official y dm- into , Pprsian Government so intormed, and P Tin Bruce ae aTgn of disapproval of his action, was removed from ’his appointment. Persian Government on their side equally disapproved the action of the tim . Governor of Fare in entering /“‘“^^^frhrPeSan without the prior approval of the &amp;hah. L - _ (Government were reminded of this m lo^o, lo.c,^ , 1907 1928 and 1929.] It appears impossible m these circum- stanc’es^to base any hgitimfte claim to Pe-an b e lg nty over Bahrein on the provisions of the -Treaty o. /.p, The Gold Coin alleged to have been struck at Please see paragraph 4 ( above. p , • ■ . A Persian Mission appears to have visited Baumin i 1816 or 1817 (paragraph 9 above) and it is conceivable that a coin might have been struck on that occasion. On the other hand, it would probably be extremely difficult to prove that the coin had not in fact been struck elsewhere thounh with an indication that it had been minted at Bahrein The incident is in itself of relatively small importance, and it would, it is suggested, be impossible for Persia to use such an incident, even it it could be proved, save in support of arguments of much more suh- at q n f 1 ^.1 r*h RTftOter. (5) Payment of Peeshkesh, Offerings or Tribute at various ‘ Stages by Bahrein to Persia. From, paragraph 6 above it will be seen that trio ate appears to have been paid by Bahrein to Persia in 1799. The rulers of Bahrein may also have offered to pay tribute in 1839 (paragraph 32) and appear to have offered to do so in 1860 (paragraph 67). In assessing the importance of the payment of tribute in 1799, or, if it then took place, in 1839 or 1860, it is relevant that such payment or promise of payment u as immediately followed by the submission of the ruleis ox Bahiem, in 1800 to Muscat, in 1839 to the Egyptians, and in I860 to the Turks. In estimating the importance of such payments as evidence of a recognition of Persian suzerainty, the arguments advanced by Her Majesty’s Minister at Pehran in his Despatch No. 28 of March 1845, in which Colonel Shell remarks that the Chiefs of Bahrein “ had in all probability from time to time given peeshkesh, offerings, or tribute to Persia as a mark of superiority, as Kandahar and Herat still continue to do, idthout an acknowledgment of subjection and the comment thereon of the Secret Com mittee of the East India Company that “ presents and complimentary messages do not imply an acknowledgment of sovereignty, and they have not been confined, to Persia” are also relevant. ( 6 ) Flying of the Persian Flag by the Sheikh of Bahrein. (a) The Persian flag was hoisted by the Sheikh of Bahrein in 1860. But as will be seen from paragraph 67 above, hardly had it been hoisted when, on live arrival of a Turkish emissary, it was lowered, and the Turkish flag- hoisted in its place. At a later stage in 1860-61 the Persian and Turkish flags were apparently flown side by side by the Sheikh. It appears difficult in these circumstances to base any substantial argument on the incident. ' (b) The Notes addressed by the Persian envoy in London to the Foreign Office in February 1869 alleged that the Persian flag had been hoisted by Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah and that the Resident had in September 1868 bombarded the41 Sheikh’s palace on which the flag was flying. There annears to be no foundation for the suggestion that the Persian flaS was flymg when the Resident reached Bahrein or t“ wS fired on (see paragraph 80). If previously hok?ed it had bv the time of the Resident’s arrival, been hauled down. ’ 7 (c) In the undated letters from Sheikh Aid. bin Khalifah f o, 1 mi F ° reig f ? iEce by the Persian envoy in p il 186.), die Sheikh stated that he was hoisting the flao- of the Lion and Sun over Bahrein. If, as seems nrnhfht from internal evidence, these letters date from the period of the abortive I ersian Mission to Bahrein of ISGOHil it is nfter a th aSS , esSlng f ‘i leir TJ importance that immediately citter the reception of the Persian envoy, a Turkish envov was received the Persian flag hauled down and the Turkish flag substituted and that m the early part of 1861 the flags of ersia and , urkey appear to have been flyino- side bv side on the forts at Bahrein. There is nothing to show that either flag flew m Bahrein between the conclusion of the Oonvennon of 1861 (paragraph 70) and 1868. ^ (d) In September 1869 the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah attacKed the islands and with the assistance of Sheikh Md bin Abdul a killed the ruling Sheikh Ali. The Persian flao- may have been hoisted on this occasion. But there is no reference to this in the detailed reports of the capture of the is ands by Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah and Sheikh Md. bin Abdubah, or of the operations as the result of which those Sheikhs were reduced at the end of 1869. (Enclosure to Government of India s Despatch No. 7 of 25th January 1870 - Resident s Despatches of 11th September, 25th September’ and 5tli October 1869.) (7) Letters from past Eulers of Bahrein admitting Persian Suzerainty. It is by no means improbable that in 1799, 1816-17, and .1839 the rulers of Bahrein addressed letters to the Persian uovernment acknowledging Persian suzerainty over the island, and they appear certainly to have done so in 1860. But the only letters the text of which has ever been communicated to Her Majesty’s Government are the two letters communicated by the Persian envoy in London in 1869. Those letters indeed categorically acknowledge Persian suzerainty over Bahrein, and state that it has been uninter ruptedly exercised in the past. But they appear to date from 1860, and the submission of Bahrein to Turkey and the hauling down of the Persian flag in the same year are, it is suggested, material in assessing the weight to be attached to them. (8) Declarations made hy Her Majesty’s Government to the Persian Minister in London, April 1869. (a) These declarations are examined in paragraph 98 above. The text of the Note addressed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Persian envoy on 29th April 1869, on which the subsequent Persian claims have to a considerable extent been based, is given in paragraph 85 above. The wording of that Note, and the general attitude adopted by Her Majesty’s Government, as evidenced by their acquiescence in the despatch of a mission to Bahrein by Persia, undoubtedly afforded Persia justification for the inferences she appears to have drawn. But, as pointed out in paragraph 10 of the Note addressed to the Persian Minister on 18th February 1929 and reproduced in Appendix B, the Note in question, while very loosely expressed, wasH % 42 Aitch.|XIII, Xo. v, 53. never intended to bear the interpretation now placed upon it by the Persian Government (cp. in thts connection para- oranhs 102 and 110 above), and m stating that due consideration had been given in the past by Her Majesty s (rDveniment to the Persian claim it did not m any y admit that that claim was valid. The Note indeed con firmed the intention of the British Government to continue to hold the Sheikhs to the treaty engagements which had been entered into with them as independent rulers. (b) The undertaking given by Her Majesty’s Government in the same correspondence to communicate m future wit Persia before undertaking punitive action against the rulers of Bahrein is prima facie consistent with a recognition by Her Majesty’s Government of Persian claims to that island. But it appears, however, in fact to have been no more than a courteous indication by His Majesty s Government of their desire to pay the fullest possible attention to any Persian claims. It will be observed that the first (and apparently the only) communication made to the Persian Government in discharge of this understanding, intimated to that Government the intention of^ Her Majesty s Government to proceed at once against the “Chief n o w i 11 possession of Bahrein” consequent on his breach of the maritime peace and his attack on the Sheikh who had been placed in power at Bahrein by the British Government. (9) Closeness of Relations at the present Day between Persia and Bahrein. The Sheikhs of Bahrein are strongly opposed to any recognition of Persian suzerainty (cp. paragraph 139). The Persian suggestion that relations are at the present time closer between Persia and Bahrein than between Bahrein and any other independent civilised State is without found.a- tion. Relations are at least equally close with Saudi Arabia, and the closest relations are maintained in addition with Great Britain and with British India. The Terms of the Treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 between the British Government and Persia. 148. In addition to the nine arguments examined above, Persia has on more than one occasion appealed to the provisions of |her treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 with the British Government in connection with her claim to Bahrein. Her appeal is based substantially on the fact that those treaties provide in certain circumstances for the evacuation of Persian territory occupied by British troops. The relevant passages of the treaties are as follows:— (i) By the preliminary Treaty of 1809 between His Majesty’s Government and Persia, the Persian Government undertook not to “ permit any European force whatever to pass through Persia either towards India or towards the ports of that country ” ; while His Majesty’s Government undertook “ in case any European forces have invaded or shall invade the territories of His Majesty the King of Persia ” to “ afford to His Majesty the King of Persia a force, or in lieu of it a subsidy, with warlike ammunition . . . and officers. ...” Article 5 of the same treaty provided ; “ If a detachment of British troops has arrived from India in the Gulf of Persia and, by the consent of His Persian Majesty, landed on the island of Karak or any of the Persian ports, they shall not in any manner possess themselves of such places, and from the date of these preliminary articles the said detachment shall43 amount'of wh1ch S sLlJ ‘settled f/A 6 d K fi“ ?PerSia ’ the Article 6 provided tLr “ rTrV defimtive treaty.” the desire of His Maiestv thp Ki ^ ? roo P s remain by or at any other port in thp p °f ?f rsi . a eit her at Karak treated in a frieoTy ^nner by tm Gor^ the J Sha11 be ments made for the sunnlv to H r0ver ? or an d arrange- .prices.

Majesty s Government might claim that the fact that their actual relations with Bahrein had in no way been affected by the provisions of those treaties, and that 1 ersia had made no protest at the time against any failure to implement those provisions clearly showed that Persia had accepted in the past the fact that Bahrein fell outside her territorial limits. In fact, neither in 1809, 1814 nor in 1857 was there any British occupation of Bahrein; while His Majesty’s Government, never having admitted Persian sovereignty over Bahrein or regarded Bahrein as an integral part of Persia, have in the past adopted the attitude that the terms of the treaties referred to above are irrelevant for the present purpose. As stated by His Majestv’s Government m 1906 in reply to a Persian Note which based the Persian claim upon the provisions of those treaties “ the treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 on this subject have always been scrupulously observed by His Majesty’s Government but have no bearing on the present question. His Majesty’s44 ssras: srvtr &amp;TS5U= view entirely inadmissible. Review of the Persian Claim. H 9 It is relevant in the first place that from 184, to 1Q1 ftw Tur vi s h claim to Bahrein was pressed with at least 1.)l.o the 1 f ( tW , Persian claim, and that through much of equal vigour to the Pe^ ha(J a stronger practical ;-aE» .b S T s”2 :'sr »,ih .Md. m«.? «ir p ; » ?&lt; ;»• 19 th centurv on more than one occasion established a temnorarv control over Bahrein and dren tribute liom i , was 1 deterred from urging its claims by force from I 8 -. onwards only by the attitude of His Majesty’s Government whUe the Wahlbi Amir, brought effective pressure to bea on Bahrein and drew tribute from it, though Jatterij probably in respect only of Bahreini possessions on the mainland, at frequent intervals through the early part of the 19 th’century, and desisted only with their subjugatio by Turkey in 1870. Persia, m other words, was up to 19lq one only of the claimants to Bahrein, and through much of the period 1847 to 1913 if anything a less insistent and to some extent a less plausible claimant than luihey. 150. These considerations, however, apart, the geu-ral effect of a review of the history ol Bahrein over the last 150 years and of an examination of the specific arguments nut, “forward bv Persia and referred to in paragraphs 14, 8 above is to suggest that there is no solid basis for a t ersian claim to suzerainty or sovereignty over the islands. Ihe geographical remoteness of the islands from lorsia an the fact that their population is Arab are admittedly not decisive arguments. The real weakness in the Persian claim appears to be that there has been no effective. exercise ot Persian authority in the islands since the expulsion of Persia by the ancestors of tbe present ruling house m 1/83. buclr incidents as the momentary hoisting of the Persian flag m I860, its flying side by side with the Turkish flag m 1860-61, or the temporary tender of allegiance to 1 ersia m 1 /JJ, ^g] 0 _] 7 and 1839 must be considered in relation to the history of the islands as a whole, in the period now under consideration, and in particular to the consistent claim of Turkey between 1847 and 1913 and to the absence of any sequel to such momentary acknowledgment of pr appeals to Persian power; and they cannot carry the weight of a long dealing extending over a course of years. The remarks of the Government of India in 1870, quoted m paragraph 9/ above, are relevant in this connection, as are the observa tions in paragraph 8 of the British iNote to leisia. oi 18th February 1929. It may be added, too, that during the period from 1 /bo Bahrein has at various dates been m a position to entei into treaty engagements or discussions with neighbouring Bcates such as Muscat (paragraph 26), Turkey (paragraph 103), the Egyptian Viceroy, Mehemet Ah (paragraph 34) and His Majesty’s Government on a basis inconsistent with her being at the time subject to Persian jurisdiction. A further point of some importance is the absence, so far as available records show, of any reference to Persia by the Sheikhs of Bahrein, at any date since the conquest of Bahrein by the ancestors of the present rulers in 1783, on the occasion ofi- - ~ 45 'W 488 KJVy WLCIO. Clk? tJ V1U t311L t3 01 eview taken by Her Majesty’s Government at that period o± the relation of Persia to Bahrein. But it cannot be valid as against the Sheikhs, and while it is sufficiently looselv expressed to afford some justification for the construction which has been placed on it by Persia, it is relevant that the construction placed on it by Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, and supported by the Government of India, passed without challenge m 1871 (paragraph 102); that_ a similar interpretation was placed on it, with a minimum of preliminary discussion, iu 1886 (paragraph 110); that at ^frequent intervals between 1870 and 1880 His Majesty’s Government maintained the independence of Bahrein against Turkey (paragraphs 99-107 above); that so early as January 1870 they drew the attention of the Turkish Government to the British Note of 1851 (para graph 61 above); and that His Majesty’s Government have uninterruptedly maintained the independence of Bahrein against Persia and Turkey alike since the date of the correspondence in question. 152. The Sheikhs themselves appear, particularly in the early part of the past century, before their relations with Her. Majesty’s Government were placed on a more definite footing by the Agreements of 1880 and 1892, to have been guided by a consideration of their own immediate interests in deciding on the line of policy to be adopted towards the stronger rulers by whom they were surrounded. But not only is it now almost three-quarters of a century since any appeal, however flimsy, appears to have been made to Persia by Bahrein, but the present Sheikh (like his predecessor) is keenly apprehensive of any recognition of the Persian claim, to which he is most strongly opposed. C.—Attitude of British Government, 1820-1934. 153. From 1820 onwards His Majesty’s Government consistently dealt with the Sheikhs as independent rulers. They concluded treaties with them on that basis in 1820, 1847, 1861, 1868, 1880 and 1892, and they have been prepared to maintain their independence by diplomatic, or on occasion by forcible methods against challenge from outside, whether from Persia, Turkey, Egypt or the Wahabis. They originally entered into relations with the Sheikhs and promised them a measure of protection (para graph 16) in the interests of securing the peace of the Persian Gulf. In the early stages of those relations they appear to have been solely concerned to achieve this object (in 1820 they even offered their mediation, which was, however, not accepted by Persia, to secure the payment of tribute to Persia by the Sheikhs), and they restricted their inter ference with the internal affairs of the Sheikhdom to the minimum required to secure the interests of British subjects. They were consistently reluctant to establish a protectorate over Bahrein in view of the probable local embarrassments in regulating the succession, &amp;c., in which this might 2953 Mn SECRET.

Your Excellency, ^^NovembTr’w 1927 I HAVE the honour to state that the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs has recently addressed a note to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran of which the following is a translation :— 1. According to information received by the Persian Government a treaty was concluded between His Britannic'Majesty and Ibn Sand and signed at Jeddah on the 20th May last, of which article 6 is as follows :— His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its dependencies undertakes to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of Kuwait and Bahrain, and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast, who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty’s Government.’ 2. The sovereignty of Persia over the Island of Bahrain being well founded, the Imperial Persian Government, at the time a special treaty was concluded between the British Government and the Sheikh of Bahrain, right- fully protested, and Lord Clarendon, in a letter dated the 29th April, 1869, addressed to the then Persian Minister in London, formally acknowledged the justice of that protest. “ 3. You will realise that the insertion of article 6 in the above- mentioned treaty, in so far as it relates to Bahrain, is averse to the territorial integrity of Persia, and, consequently, incompatible with the friendly relations subsisting between two neighbouring countries. “ 4. I therefore earnestly protest against the insertion of the above article in the treaty, and shall look forward to suitable measures being taken, as soon as practicable, by His Britannic Majesty’s Government, with a view to its elimination. c ‘ 5. I have to add further that, Persia being a member of the League of Nations, the Imperial Persian Government, conformably to article 10 of the Covenant, which guarantees the territorial integrity of its members, have forwarded a copy of their note to the League of Nations, with the request that their protest may receive due consideration.” I beg leave to bring this matter to the notice of your Excellency for your kind consideration.

Foreign Office, January 18, 1928. ’ I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 26th November, containing the formal protest which the Persian Government have seen fit to make against the terms of article 6 of the Treaty of Jeddah, concluded on the 20th May, 1927, between His Britannic Majesty and His Majesty the King2 if.a ‘s ts&amp;tiz&amp;itt fas'ss claim of the Persian Government to sovereignty over these islands ^ or can t ?8th century ^Bahrein 4 was overrun SfoTpied byPers^tj^-. ^ followers of certain chiefs from the eastern shores of the Persian ^lf but n appears to be established that in or about the year 178 V“t^°^ e . “funder the Shah were dispossessed of the islands by an invasion ^ r ^ ^ leadership of the direct lineal ancestor of the present sheikh and that smceUi date the islands have never at any time been under ed that their o Persian Government have on various occasions alleged tnat meir claim to sovereignty 11 over Bahrein has been recognised, by His Majesty s Govern ment While hisLt evident that, even if this assertion were justified, it would confer on Persia the right of ownership which on other grounds appeals so difhoi t to establifh His Majesty’s Government feel that they must once and for all declare this statement to be entirely inadmissible. , , ,, 4 The special treaty relations between His Majesty s Government and the successive Sheikhs of Bahrein, to which reference is made m the Treaty of Jeddah, have now been in existence for more than a century, the first m the senes of under takings by which those relations are regulated having been signed m the year 1820. The agreements have throughout been concluded on the basis mat me Sheikh of Bahrein is an independent ruler. His Majesty’s Government no not deny that the claim to independence of the sheikh is one which has from time to time been contested by the Government of the Shah, and m particular m the discussions which took place in 1869, to which reference is made m your note, j desire however, to point out that your Government are under a complete misunderstanding in inferring from the terms of the communication made by the late Earl of Clarendon to the Persian Minister on the 29th April, 1869, that any recognition of the validity of the Persian claims to sovereignty in Bahiein was at that time intended. Iii that note it was stated that Her Majesty’s Government had given due consideration to the protest of the Persian Government ct against the Persian right of sovereignty over Bahrein being ignored by the British authorities,” but it in no way admitted any such right. On the contrary, the whole tenor of the note should have made it clear that Her Majesty’s Government maintained their right to enter into direct treaty relations with the Sheikhs of Bahrein as independent rulers; and while at the same time it indicated that Her Majesty’s Government would gladly transfer to Persia, if she were able and willing' to perform them, certain duties in the Persian Gulf towards the performance of which the treaty relations in question contributed, and ofiered, in view of the friendly feelings entertained by Her Majesty's Government towards Persia, to cause the Persian Government to be informed beforehand, when practicable, of any measure of coercion which the conduct of the sheikhs might have rendered necessary, it is evident that no recognition of the validity of the Persian protest, or of the Persian claim to suzerainty, was thereby intended or implied. The note, in fact, as the Persian Legation at Constantinople was reminded in December 1871 by Sir Henry Elliott, then Her Majesty’s Ambassador in Turkey, contains nothing more than an acknowledgment that the Persian claim to suzerainty had previously been made. The numerous supplementary agree ments entered into between the British Government and the rulers of Bahrein between 1869 and the present day have equally proceeded on the assumption that a claim to sovereignty in Bahrein on the part either of the Government of the Shah or of the Turkish Government could not possibly be admitted by His Majesty’s Government, 5. The attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards this question was still more clearly defined when in the year 1906 His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, on mv predecessor’s instructions, addressed to the Persian Government a note stating that “ His Majesty’s Government have never admitted the ownership or sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein, and such a claim is, in their view, entirely inadmissible. His Majesty’s Government consider the Island of Bahrein and itsinhabitants to be under British protection, and must decline to entertain any further representations on the subject.” The note added that this renly had invariably been made to the Ottoman Government, which had on several occasions advanced a claim to Bahrein. In reply to this note, a formal protest was received from the Persian Government, in which their claim to sovereignty over Bahrein was based on an agreement, dated the 30th August, 1822 &amp; between aptain Whlliam Bruce, the special commissioner of the British Government,” and the Prince Governor of Shiraz. This agreement, however, as was pointed out in a reply from His Majesty’s Minister on the 2nd January, 1907, and again on the 23rd February, 1907, was promptly disavowed at the time by the proper representatives of His Britannic Majesty, as having been entered' into without authority, and His Majesty Path Ali Shah also refused to recognise its stipulations, and expressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz should have entered into any engagements with the British Government without his knowledge or instructions. In these circumstances, having regard to international law and custom, the agreement cannot be regarded as ever having possessed any binding force. 6. From the foregoing remarks you will observe that the Persian Govern ment are not justified in supposing that His Majesty’s Government, either in 1869 or at any other time, intended to recognise that Bahrein was a part of Persia, and that, while they have, indeed, admitted that a claim on the subject has from time to time been put forward by the Persian Government, they have never admitted the validity of the claims which either the Turkish or Persian Governments have frequently put forward in the past. Their consistent endeavour in the matter of Bahrein has been to secure that the peaceful development of the islands and the welfare of the Arab inhabitants shall not be disturbed by unjustified attempts on the part of their neighbours to subject them to a foreign domination. They are not prepared to contemplate any departure from this policy. I have, &amp;c.

Sir, IN a note dated the 18th January, 1928, I had the honour to inform you, in reply to your note of the 26th November, 1927, respecting the claim advanced by your Government to the islands of Bahrein, that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were not aware of any valid grounds upon which the claim of the Persian Government to sovereignty over those islands was or could be based. Some months later, on the 2nd August, 1928, the Persian Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran a further note explaining in detail the reasons which have led his Government to consider themselves justified in advancing such a claim. I now have the honour to request that you will convey to your Government the following reply :— 2. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have examined with the greatest care the views set forth in the Persian Government’s note of the 2nd August, and have endeavoured to extract from the many unsupported declarations that Bahrein forms an integral part of Persia (a statement which, as I have already indicated in my note under reference, bears no relation to geographical facts), the essential arguments on which this claim is based. They note that the Persian Government do not in any way base their claim on the alleged recognition of their rights in the past by His Majesty’s Government. So far as can be deduced from their note under reply, their claim is, in fact, founded on three main arguments : Firstly, on uninterrupted possession except for the period of Portuguese occupation between 1507 and 1622; secondly, on an alleged principle of international law that a territory belonging to a sovereign State cannot be lawfully detached so long as its annexation by another State or its independence have not been officially recognised by the lawful owner of the territory; and thirdly, on documents of a date later than the end of the 18th century, in which the sheikhs of the islands are alleged to have declared their submission to the Persian Government, and on the alleged payment by them of tribute to the Persian Government. After full examination of these arguments His Majesty’s Government have reached the conclusion, for the reasons given below, that they entirely fail to substantiate a Persian claim to sovereignty ovei the islands at the present day. 3. In the first place, the statement that “Bahrein has always and uninterruptedly formed part of Persia in past centuries, except during the Portuguese occupation from 1507 to 1622 ” is not one which can be allowed to pass unquestioned. I have already drawn attention to the evident tact that geographically this, assertion is misleading. Historically it is almost equa } misleading. The earlier history of the islands before 1507 is obscure, but it cannot seriously be maintained that they were subject to Persian sovereignty all thioug the Arab, Mongol and Tartar invasions and the anarchy of the Middle Ages _ Un the contrary, modern historians have expressed the opinion that ±rom the oisland was then governed by c^rf. ^ pmia be ? ore i 50 7. accept the view th ^*®'^g^'the islands were occupied by the Portuguese, a Between the years 1507 and Ibid ttit * : n( j 0 f Persian rule began m the Persian Government themselves a dm ih Thepeiiod out s of the 1622 and ended in 1783, when the ersi-^ _ p p a j ire j ni but it is not to be islands by the ancestors of the V ve ^ ‘ 'p ersian ascendancy, Persian rule was asas. asrs=9 «f!5 «£ ; dav are strongly represented there, though in 1753 Persia was again able to asse . her ascenSy by conquest. In 1783, however, the troops of His Majesty the Shah were finally driven out by the Utubi Arabs, and the authority o erma ceaseA, n ^e^to be from t b e brief historical summary contained m the preceding paragraph that such historical evidence as can be adduced in favour of the Persian claim must rest mainly upon intermittent occupation between the years 1622 and 1783, a period which comprises at least two periods of Arab _• On the other hand, a period of approximately equal length between 1783 and the present day has elapsed during which no dominion has been exercised m islands by Persia, and x\rab rule has been uninterrupted. In these circumstances His Majesty’s Government cannot but regard the claim ot Bahrein to independence from Persia as abundantly established. 5 It is in the light of the historical events summarised above that the second argument of the Persian Government must be examined, viz., that part of their note now under reply in which they affirm as an alleged principle of international law the statement that “a territory belonging to a sovereign State cannot be lawfully detached so long as the right of ownership has not been transferred by this State to another State in virtue of an official act, in this case a treaty^ or so Iona as its annexation by another State or its independence have not been officially recognised by the lawful owner of the territory.” Even if this statement could be accepted as valid, it would still be necessary for Persia to prove that she is, or ever has been, the lawful owner of Bahrein, and that such rights as she may have acquired in former ages by conquest and the exercise of force outweigh those not only of the Portuguese, but of the Arab inhabitants themselves. 6. His Majesty’s Government, however, deny without hesitation that any r such principle, if alleged to be of universal application, forms part of inter national law. The assertion that the consent of the dispossessed State is invariably required to validate a change of sovereignty is contradicted both by international practice and the facts of history. Moreover, it would, if it existed, seriously prejudice the maintenance of peace and international order. It would be open to any State to advance a claim to territory, of which it has not for centuries been in effective possession, on the ground that its loss of possession in distant ages had not been confirmed by a subsequent treaty. To assert such a legal principle would be to assert that on a disputed question of territory the one factor that is decisive is the expressed will of one of the disputants. On the contrary, in cases where a territory has effectively established its independence of the former sovereign, a treaty by which the disposed owner recognises its independence is in effect chiefly valuable as conclusive evidence that, in the view r of the former sovereign, such independence has been effectively established. In such cases the effective establishment by the territory of its independence is the deciding factor in the question of international title, and in the case of Bahrein His Majesty’s Government regard as wholly untenable the proposition that effective possession and administration by the present ruling family for 145 years, during which these rulers have been independent of Persia, and during which no Persian authority has been exercised in their dominions, can be affected by the mere consideration that the Persian Government have not set their signature to a document formally recognising the fact of their independence.&amp; which has colonies tates f i, is ’ more ^ ve J’ abundantly clear from historical precedents that the theory of tne necessity for the formal consent of the dispossessed State is not one has ever obtained international acceptance. The revolted Spanish k VL v America were diplomatically recognised as independent the United States Government in 1822 and by the British Government “ man 7 years before their independence was formally admitted by Spain The independence of , exas m 1837 and that of Panama in 1903 were recognised by the United States and subsequently by Great Britain and other European I oweis, loitg befoie Alexico and Colombia had ceased to look upon those territoi les as revolted provinces. In these instances, to which others could if necessary, be added, the effective establishment of independence was clearly regarded by the Powers as the ruling factor in the situation, and the consent ot the dispossessed btate was not held to be a condition sine qua non of a valid transfer or acquisition of territory. In the case of Bahrein, whose sheikhs have now been in treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government for more than a century as independent rulers, it was thus not necessary for His Majesty’s Government to await the consent of Persia before such recognition could be accorded. 8. 1 he only other argument advanced by the Persian Government in support of their claim is the statement that the sheikhs of Bahrein at some time later than the end of the 18th century declared in writing their entire submission and fidelity to the Persian Government, and that they paid tribute to the Persian Government. Although the Persian Government do not give any details in corroboration of this assertion, and although it would probably be difficult at the present day to prove the authenticity of any documents which may be in their possession, His Majesty’s Government are perfectly prepared to admit the possibility that such documents may exist. They do not, however, consider that the existence of such documents, or even evidence, were this forthcoming, of payments by the Rulers of Bahrein to the Government of the Shah can be regarded as establishing the validity of Persia’s claim. They have always been well aware that the unfortunate rulers of the islands, surrounded by warlike and more powerful States which menaced their independence, professed on various occasions during the first sixty or seventy years of the 19th century an unwilling allegiance to Muscat, to Persia, to Turkey, to the rulers of the mainland of Arabia, even to Egypt—to any Power, in short, who would agree to offer them protection and seemed at the time in a strong enough position to do so; and that at different times for short periods they paid tribute to Muscat, Egypt, or the Wahabi Arabs of the mainland. Any argument based on payment of tribute would, therefore, be available in support of a claim to sovereignty over Bahrein by any of the States to which tribute was, in fact, paid, and, in any case, it is evident that this timid and vacillating policy pursued on occasion by his predecessors cannot be held to affect the position of the present sheikh, who is firm in his determination to resist the Persian Government’s claims, and has empowered His Majesty’s Government to refute them on his behalf, in virtue of the treaties which give them the right of defending Bahrein from external aggression. 9. In view of the fact that the Persian Government do not base any part of their claim on the alleged recognition of that claim by His Majesty s Government in the past, it seems unnecessary here to reply in detail to the various arguments by which the Persian Government endeavour to show that their claims have received British recognition in the past. I have already, in my note of the 18th January, 1928, explained that it has never on any occasion been the intention of His Majesty’s Government to admit the validity of Persia s claims, and I must now ask the Persian Government to believe that a further full and careful examination of the contemporary records confirms that statement in its entirety. Ever since the year 1820, when His Majesty s Government hist entered into special treaty relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein without any reference to the Government of the Shah, they have acted on Ike assumption that the sheikh is an independent ruler. In 1822, when Captain William Bruce was recalled for having negotiated the terms of an agreement with the Prince Governor of Shiraz without their authority, the main reason recorder for his recall and for the prompt disavowal of tills tentative agreement is that “ it acknowledges the King of Persia’s title to Bahrein, of which there io not the least proof.” No clearer statement could possibly have been made of the [10151] cviews held by His Majesty’s GoTO1 '“f “^f^itopimon 6 ^ a they have never smee seen ^^8 note Qf ^ April) 1869 to which the Persian Got^ent devote ^ “tar was fcurs ^“.s: Government are entirely unable to admit that an implicit acknowledgment of the validity of the Persian claims is constituted by the reference m that note to the considerations which led to the establishment and the maintenance of those treaty relations; nor can they agree that the dependence or otherwise of Bahrein on Persia can in any way be affected by the fact that m entering upon and maintaining their treaties with the sheikhs they were principally moved by a desire to suppress piracy and the slave trade and to maintain the police of the Gulf duties which the Persian Government themselves were not m a position effectively to perform. It is true that at that time Her Majesty s Government were mainly influenced by the consideration that they, like Persia, were interested in the safety of the Persian Gulf for commerce, and that they would gladly have accepted Persia’s co-operation in maintaining order had her naval position admitted of it; but, although they did not consider Persia’s claims to ownership to be valid, they were not at that Gme directly concerned in refuting them. The special treaties by which they eventually agreed to accept the control of the sheikh’s foreign relations were concluded at a later date. 11. I must in this connexion invite the Persian Government to take note of the fact that there is no conceivable ground for the suggestion in the last paragraph of the second section of your Government’s note under reply that the independent status enjoyed by the rulers of Bahrein can in any sense be represented as the result of &lt;c rebellion at a foreign State’s instigation.” This suggestion is one which His Majesty’s Government repudiate as entirely unjustifiable. When in 1820, consequent on their suppression of the piratical activities of the independent rulers of the trucial coast of Oman, they found it necessary to consider the position in regard to Bahrein, nearly forty years had elapsed since the conquest of this island by the ancestor of the present sheikh, and during those years Persia had exercised no dominion in the islands and appeared to have taken no measures to re-establish her position. They had accordingly no hesitation in entering into negotiations and concluding a treaty with the independent ruler without prior reference to the Government of the Shah. Their object, as stated by Lord Clarendon in 1869, was the suppression of piracy and the maintenance of peace. in the Gulf; they strictly confined themselves to the measures necessary to attain that object, and while it might have been open to them to establish their dominion over the sheikh, they did not choose to do so, but contented themselves with an arrangement to secure the safety of international shipping without imposing on themselves the burden of administration. They maintained this position not only in 1820 but on other occasions in subsequent years, and notably in 1848, when they declined to accede to the sheikh s request that his dominions should be incorporated in those of Her Majesty the Queen, The treaty of 1820, by which the Sheikh of Bahrein bound himself to abstain from plunder and piracy by land and sea, from the slave traffic and from inter-tribal war was followed in 1847, in 1856, and 1861 by further treaties designed to secure the same objects—the suppression of slavery, and the general pacification of the Gulf in the interests of international shipping. The British Government concluded all these treaties with the sheikh as an independent ruler, and consistently refused throughout to admit the lurkish, Persian and other claims to sovereignty over his dominions. It was not until the tieaty of 1861 that Her Majesty’s Government, in return for the sheikh s undei taking to abstain from maritime aggression, war and piracy, assme im m °f their support against similar aggression, nor till a still ater period m 1880 and 1892, that they took upon themselves the unqualified ia i i y oi the foreign relations of that ruler, under which he has now invoked eir assisance m lepelling what he not unnaturally regards as a wholly unprovoked attempt on his independence by a foreign Government.12. In conclusion, His Majesty’s Government cannot refrain from expressing their surprise that the Persian Government should have referred in this correspondence to article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations under which the members of the League undertake to respect anS preserve as against ixternal aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all members of the League; and that they should seemingly imagine that the terms of this article lay an obligation on members of the League to support Persian pretensions to an island which is separated from Persia bv the whole width of the Persian Gulf, and over which Persia has exercised no authority for 14o years. - 7 13. It will be evident to the Persian Government that His Maiesty’s Government m the Lnited Kingdom have carefully weighed the arguments advanced m the note now under reply, and that although they have found no reason to modify their previous opinions, their attitude is dictated bv their genuine conviction that those arguments are untenable, and is in no wav inspired by a policy hostile to Persia s legitimate aspirations. They cannot believe that the true interests of Persia can be served by a continued lefusal to recognise the long-standing independence of the State of Bahrein. They are, indeed, hopeful that the Government of the Shah, whose enlightened domestic policy they have long followed with friendly interest, will acknowledge the desirability of establishing good relations with Persia’s neighbours, and, realising that -their present antiquated claim cannot properly be sustained and is an insurmountable obstacle to the establishment of such good relations with the Government and people of Bahrein, will on further consideration desist from its pursuit. 14.

My dear Laithwaite, You will remember that when the decision was taken to refer the Bahrein issue to the Law Officers I promised to have a word with our Legal Advisers on the question whether, in assembling the facts for submission, it would be necessary to go back before 1783, the date on which the Persians were finally driven out of the islands. 2. Beckett’s view is that if it were a practical possibility to deal in detail with the historical material available for the period before 1783, it would be definitely ifiore satisfactory to do so. As, however, that is apparently out of the question, owing to the fact that the documents are for the most part in Arabic and are anyhow not all available in London, he thinks that we shall have to content ourselves with a prefatory note in which the period before 1783 is dealt with as fully as the material at our disposal.. J,G. Laithwaite, Esq., India Office.disposal here permits* An expanded version of paragraph 3 of our note of the 18th February, 1929, to the then Persian Minister, quoting the authorities there referred to, is, I suppose, all that will he possible in the circumstances. We should explain in this prefatory note that Persian newspapers, presumably inspired, have dealt at considerable length with the history of Bahrein in the more or less remote past, but that it has been impossible, owing to the time factor, to check their statements in detail.

I have the honour, etc. (signed) B. KAZEMI Minister for Foreign Affairs. P.T.O.2 Annex Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Teheran, May 28 1934 {Tr anslation ) Your Excellency, Some four years ago, my Government heard for the first time through the foreign press that a British syndicate; had obtained a concession to exploit the Bahrein oil fielas amd had begun work in that region. As the Bahrein Islands form an integral part of Persian territory and as the Imperial Government possesses incontestable rights of sovereignty over them, my Government protested energetically to His Britannic Majesty’s Legation at Teheran against the proceedings of the said syndicate, which had unlawiully obtained this concession and had begun to exploit^ the wealth of that territory, thereby violating Persia’s rights of sovereignty. A copy of this letter of protest was forwarded to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations who, at the Persian Government’s request, communicated it to all the States Members. According to information recently received by the Imperial Government, a concession to exploit Bahrein oil has iust been obtained by the Standard Gil Company of California, which has begun operations and has already extracted large quantities of oil. I have the honour to draw your serious attention to the above and to inform you that the concession in question or any other concession acquired by the Standard Oil Company or any other company whatsoever - having been obtained not fmm the Persian Govern:.ent whose rights of sovereignty over the Bahrein Islands are incontestable, but from legally incompetent authorities who have no right to grant such concessions - is regarded as null and void. My Government strongly protests against this concession and considers itself at liberty to claim and demand the restitution of any profit that may accrue from such concessions, as well as compensation for any damage that may result therefrom. I should therefore be glad if your Excellency would be good enough to communicate this letter to the Government of the Republic of the United States of America and would request it to communicate the contents to the Standard Oil Company of California. I have the honour, etc. (Signed) B. KAZEMI Ministry of Foreign Affairs. To His Excellency, Mr. William H. Hornibrook, United States Minister, Teheran.P.z. 4203/34. r.-xJ . S ' Record oi' an interview with m-« t g-^evvjith Mr. Loomi g, Foreie-n Adviser t Stand^d_0ii Qompaav of 50? •. - ^ Mr. Loomis came this morning by appointment made through the United States Embassy. As X did not know what subject Mr.Loomis was going to raise, and as the questions in which the Company are interested and which concern this department, are all dealt with jointly with the India Office, I had asked Mr. Walton of that Department to be present. Mr. Loomis asked what was the position in regard to the recent Persian note to the United States Legation in Tehran protesting against the grant by the Sheikh to the Bahrein Oil Company (a subsidiary of Standard Oil of California! of the Bahrein oil,concession. He said that the Persian Legation in Washington had also sent a communication to the Company on the same point. When he left Washington recently he understood from the State Department that they had not yet decided whether to reply to the Persian note or not; in the former case, he understood the reply would be a bare acknowledgment. I told Mr. Loomis that the Persian Government had reiterated this claim from time to time, notably in the two communications of which copies had been sent to the League of Hations, to whom our replies declining to admit that there was any basis for the claim had also been communicated. He told me that he had three years ago been given by Mr. Eendel a copy of Sir Austen Chamberlain^ note of February 18th, 1929. It seemed to him a very complete answer to the Persian claim. He asked whether he could have a copy of the note of January 18th, 1928, and I said I would either send him one through Mr. Millard at the United States Embassy or give him a reference to the League document containing/containing it. Mr. Loomis then, in the course of further conversation on his Company’s various oil interests in the Persian Gulf area, asked what the relations were between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Qatar. Mr. Walton and I explained that there were no special relations between them, except that under the Treaty of Jedda Ibn Saud agreed to keep on fiendly terms with the sheikh of Qatar and other local potentates who were in special treaty relations with Sis Majesty’s Government. Mr. Loomis said that Ibn Saud had rather implied to his Company that he had some kind of overlordship over the Sheikh of Qatar, and quoted the Foreign Office Peace Handbook of Arabia, 1920, as saying that Ibn Saud's dominion at that time extended over Qatar. We told Mr.Loomis that the statement in the Handbook was certainly a mistake, and Mr. Loomis said that he was glad to know, as his Company did not wish to be misled by Ibn Saud in the matter. At a later stage of the conversation we were looking at the map and X indicated to Mr. Loomis the Blue Line. Mr. Loomis at once said ”0h, yes. The line laid down by the Anglo- Turkish Conventions”. He evidently knew of the explanations regarding the blue line which we gave the U.S. Embassy here. Mr. Loomis also enquired whether any oil concession had yet been given to the Gulf Oil Company and the Anglo- Persian Oil Company in Koweit, and Mr. Walton replied tnat the negotiations were not yet concluded. Mr. Loomis then referred to the Koweit Neutral Zone and remarked that his Company had, under the provisions of their concession over the Rasa, an arrangement in respect of Ibn Saud’s right to/to grant an oil concession in the Neutral Zone. I asked him what this amounted to, and he said that the provision was not very definite hut was to the effect that the Standard Oil Company had the right of first refusal. (This confirms our previous information). In the course of the conversation Mr. Loomis also said that the reports of his Company’s geologists working in the Hasa promised favourably, and that his Company were not interested in any other area of Ibn Saud’s dominion. .

His l£ajesty*s Government have been at pains to make it clear in the past that inter ference with these regions cannot be suffered. Their pr0teCti ° n against *^&lt;*8 is to the British Empire a measure of self-defence. It must he clearly understood that His Majesty 1 s CfoTernment in Great Britain accept the new treaty upon the distinct understanding that it does not prejudice their freedom of action in this respect. The Government of the United States have comparable interests, any disregard of which by a foreign Power they have declared that they would regard as an unfriendly act. His Majesty’s Government believe therefore that in defending their position they are expressing the intention and meaning of the United States Government.* 3. In the United States* reply to this note no mention was made of this reservation and the whole question was therefore examined in a Poreign Office Uemoi'andum dated the 29th June 1928, in which the conclusion was reached thatthat any unilateral declaration of this kind at the time of signature of the Kellogg Pact relating to our position in Egypt and the Persian Oulf would provoke considerable opposition in the United States and might well create difficulties in the United States senate® It is presumed that no such declaration was therefore actually made at the time of signature&gt; but it appears that the text of paragraph 10 quoted above was subse quently communicated to the Secretary General, League of nations, Geneva, with the request that copies might be circulated to all Members of the League {vide Foreign Office letter No. 5360/1/45 dated the 4th August 1928, addressed to the Secretary General, League of Nations, Geneva). It occurs to us that it might be possible now for some such unilateral declaration to be made by His MaJesty^s Government with regard to the Arab Shaikhdoms in the Persian Gulf in the hope that such a declaration would make it clear both to Persia and to the Members of the League that His Majesty^ Government were not prepared to acquiesce in any interference with the existing status of those principalities by the inter vention of International Tribunals. It is true that at the time of signature of the Kellogg Pact the matter for consideration was not one of reference of a dispute relating... • •.

Could you please refer to my demi-oi ficial letter Ho• 1201-s| dated the 26tlx December 1934, on the subject of arbitration with the « ersian covemnient over Bahrain.

The article enumerated the questions at issue as i ollows; 1* The refusal of Persia to organise her political relations with Iraq. 2* The desire of Persia to occupy a portion of the Iraqi Jhatt al ,rab and the interference on the part of her officials there with the Iraqi officials from time to time • The hon'ble fr.H.A. .Metcalfe, €#S*I* ,C *1 •B* ,M* V*v-., Foreign Secretary to the Goveniiaent ox luaia, New Delhi3. The desire of fersla to taka possession of the Islands of Bahrain• 4* The desire of ersia to extend her influence over the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf. 4. After dwelling at some length on these points the article went on to says ” prom the above it will appear that the A irsians wish to link up tiie two questions (i.e. Iraq and Bahrain) and make them the subject of a bargain, so that they may extract something from Iraq or from England or from Bahrain. It is hardly necessary for us to say that the Iraqis will certainly not give in to the ersiana, any more than will the people of Bahrain.'

In reaching the conclusion that the island formed a part of Netherlands territory, the arbitrator considered that there should be taken into consideration **all the evidence which tends to show that there were 'unchallenged acts of peaceful display of Netherlands 'sovereignty in the period from 1700 to 1906 ... '‘which . . . may be regarded as sufficiently proving the 'existence of Netherlands sovereignty.' 4. The answer to Loch's question seems to be that the Netherlands had exercised sovereignty for a long period before the United States (or Spain as the predecessor in title of the United States) took exception to their doing so.pr 30 Extract from p. and p. letter to Mr. Metcalfe, dated 21st January, 1935. xxx I see that Fowle has sent in a demi-official letter on the subject of arbitration over Bahrein. Though there is a great deal of substance in some of Fowle's points, vie are afraid'that there is no use m trying to dispute the proposition that, since His Majesty’s Government are in charge of Bahrein's :oreign relations, they must take responsibility m any international dispute. That cock will not fight. Ii Persia raised her claim to Bahrein in the Council of the League we should have to answer. On the other ham, ..e at the India Office would agree that His Majesty’s Government should certkinly refuse to submit the case m arbitration or to the Permanent Court, and that they would have good grounds for explaining this refusal by referring to the facts that the S heikh is an independent ruler, that we are in a fiduciary position towards him, that he refuses to submit the puescion of his own existence to the Court or to an arbitral body, and that consequently we cannot, on his behalf, agree ro do sc. Fowle also refers to the bad effect which a commission ol investigation ‘’on the spot” would have on Arao opinion. I should hope that the Council would not propose any saci, step. — toCONFIDENTIAL.

(ii) In paragraph 12 of the roreign Office letter referred to above it eeema to be aseuaeu t-fat because the shaikh has entrusted his foreign relations to His Majesty's dovernraeat ^‘ i8 Adltt facm coaraiits him to aU iaternaUoual obligations entered into by Iti* lajesty's Soverwwnt - in this case the latter's obligation# to to# heague.

This is, nosovar, tar iron being the oaae, Bahrain being “en independent arab State, under the protection of Ids majesty's Government, but not a British i-rotectorats” (?»a»13 page SI paragraph 2). (ill) In this connectism It may be emphaetsec that I is Majesty's uovemoent's policy nowadays is to strsss the international independence of the .rao Shaihho ae swch possible (vide lor instance the Air Agreement) since it is only by so doing that we can, outs ids mat sra deilnitsly provided for in our treaties, continue to preserve our influence on the Arab coast by working through the Ar*b r&amp;ply w#re in tfc# nouXci inform to swction arbitration t and take the opportunity of point- ittg /pointing out that Ud« rexueaX was remaQXi&amp;buU enough eincei (a) The jhalkh is an indspendsnt sovereign.

The question is not now argent, as the Persian Govt, have not r aised tne Bahrein case at Geneva, and have shown no further indication of any intention of doing so. The F.O. letter, though controversial in tone, goes a good way in reality to meeting our views in substance. It is conceivable, as suggested m para. 4 of their letter, that the Persian claim might be submitted as a result of a concrete case in.which Persia attempted some act of aggression and we resisted it. In that case the issues would be clearly defined. If, however, we supposed Persia to submit her claim in the abstract (without any preliminary concrete incident), it is more difficult to foresee m detail what would be the best procedure for the British representative to adopt m dealing with it at the outset of the proceedings before the Council. But m any case it would probably be desirable at an early stage m the proceedings to give prominence to the facts regarding the status of Bahrein, and to point out that, since it is at any rate de facto independent of Persia, a situation endangering peace (Art. 11) or a rupture (Art. 15) could hardly be brought about except by Persian aggression. We have never suggested, however, that it would be nossible or desirable to prevent the Council being seized of the master. The present F.O. letter goes far to clear out of the way the chief point of difference which emerged from the previous correspondence, v^z.., the question of a voluntary submission to the jurisdiction of the International Court. Our objection to this is, of course, that we ought not to put ourselves in a position in which there/there is any risk (however small) of our being faced Wxti: the dilemma of -e-itter having to break our obligations under the Covenant (by submitting; a case to the Court and then declining to implement its decision) or our engagements to ; the Sheikh. Para. 7 of the present r.O. letter explains that there are two other courses besides a voluntary ' agreement to submit to the Court’s jurisdiction* ^hese aie for the Council (1) to ask the Court for an advisory opinion, and (2) to seek the advice of aiM 'mi committee o jurists. Para. 11 of the F.O. letter further admits that a request by the Council for an advisory opinion may be preferableibo an agreement between the parties to submit to the Court’s jurisdiction. This is a step towards the elimination of what we found most objectionable in the F.O.’s previous proposal. The effect of a request by the Council to the Court for an advisory opinion is, of course, quite different from an agreement between two parties to submit a dispute between them to the Court’s jurisdiction. The Council, as the F.O. admit, would still have to deal with the case after it had received the advisory opinion of the Court, the F.O. say that if the opinion were in favour of Persia’s claim (of coarse a very unlikely hypothesis), it seems probable that the members of the Council would unanimously agree. This,I should have thought, is a conjecture of very doubtful validity. The Council is a political body which can take account of political considerations. Prima f§£i£ a unanimous report by such a body against H.M.G. hardly seems likely. But even if it should materialise, it would be a lesser evil than a judicial decision by the Court against us. A draft letter to the ?.Q. submitted, which touches//I . Minute Paper.

Sir Samuel Hoare to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 6th November, E 5669/139/34, relative to the contingency of the Persian Govt, referring its claims to Bahrein, Tamb or Aba Musa to the League of Nations. A. Sir Samuel Hoare notes that the matter is now regarded as less urgent, since the Persian Govt, have shown no desire to bring these claims before the Council of the League for decision, lie doubts whether any good purpose would be served at this stage by discussing in any great detail the instructions which should be given to the’British representative if the Persian Govt, should take such a step at some future time. Much would evidently depend on the circumstances in which the hypothetical case arose, and the general political situation at the time. If Persia committed an act of aggression and then complained of the measures taken to resist it, there would be a clear issue on a concrete case. If, on the other hand, i - Persia sought to bring her claims m the abstract before the Council, Sir Samuel Hoare has not suggested that, even m this event, it would be possible or desirable to prevent the Council being seized of the question, but he considers that it would be important at an early stage of the proceedings/4./ proceedings to explain the independent status of Bahrein, or the Arab State concerned, and to point oat that there is no reason why | its independence of Persia should lead to a rupture or endanger peace unless Persia coinmitted an act of aggression. 3. As regards the nature of the proceedings before the Council, Sir Samuel Hoare notes the three possible courses described in para. 7 of your letter. For | the reasons indicated in para. 4 oi the I.Q. letter of 8th November, he considers that |t would be impossible for H.M.G. to agree to the first course, namely, a special agreement between the parties to submit the ease to the jurisdiction of the International Court. He is aware that H.M.G. are bound to ^ MV) carry out in cases voluntarily submitted to the Court. But they are also precluded by long standing engagements to the Sheikh of Bahrein, and by their own interests and regard for their reputation | for good faith, from carrying out a decision that Bahrein should be surrendered to Persia. It seems clear, therefore, that H.M.G. ought to avoid taking any risk (however negligible it may appear) of placing themselves in a position m which they would be laced by an insoluble conflict of obligations. For this reason he suggests that the first alternative must in any event be ruled out.3164 5000 10.34 Draft Paper. t Department. 4. In either of the other -i &gt; , . .. shy h.A*s* (c alternatives the Council would arrive at A its own conclusion after either asking the Court for an advisory opinion or seeking the advice of a committee of jurists. It seems highly improbable that the Council, which would naturally take account of political as well as other considerations, would arrive at a unanimous conclusion in favour of Persia. Even in this most unlikely event, however, it appears that the consequences under the relevant articles of the Covenant would be far less serious than that of an actual judicial, and undoubtedly binding, decision by the International Court in favour of Persia on a case voluntarily submitted to its jurisdiction.
