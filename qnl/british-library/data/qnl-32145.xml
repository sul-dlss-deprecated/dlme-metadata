Baghdad is a city of at present about 160,GuQ inhabitants, of which about three quarters live on the left bank and one quarter on tile right bank of the river. xne average daily sick nay be esti aft ted at not less than • 7aOO of whom much less than one tenth can be dealt with by the few private medical practitioners now here. A—e n'dict^ice is left to be c. eaIt with so long as the war lasts by official and institutional methods, or not den It with at all. Assuming that out of the 7500 daily sick, only 4GCu are of * tne classes who will avail themselves of d/pensary or hospital treatment (^ 10 derate estimate) and assuming al 0 that there are enough private practitioners to deal with the other 3500 (which is not the case as most of the civil medical practitioners were removod by the Turks) the requirements for dealing with such [ number of sick would be Inpatient accommodation (at the lowest computation) 600 bee Outpatient departments staffed to deal with over 3000 patients daily. The acco modation actually available at present is 1. Civil hospital (on right bank) (including poor house in- 150 beds w 0 200 daily 2. Civil dispensary [left bank) for out pat 1 ents with (for u. u &lt; fi rm&amp;ry) Inpati ent outpatients department capable of dealing with 6 beds 200 daily IoO .beds, luu beas. 20 beds observation) and capable of dealing with 3e The venereal Hospital for ,/omen. 4. Civil Isolation Hospital. 5. Jail dispensary with The Staff available to deal with all this is 1. One over worked Civil Surgeon (Bt. hajor Carey hvans, k.O) kno^vn as the hedical Officer, Baghdad, whose duties include :,a) the ad' dni strati on of the Civil hospital. v_ /c) the actual professional care of all'the patients therein k cj the actual surgical work of the whole of the hospital. In all the above Ms riost reliable assistant is an unquali lied Armenian, who talks no Ihglish. The nursing is done by ior&gt;r French Moeurs 1 ', only one of yhom has received tecimical training. (d) Detailed supervision of the work of the Venereal hosoital ior women. - ^ (e) The male jail medical charge. Female jail medical charge. g) care of lunatics. n) The supervision^of the Civil dispensary, iy the maning of all arrangements for the recruitment and /.• training of pharmacists, nurses and dressers. (jj i^ecacal charge of the Internment Camp. i»ll this is quite beyond the capacity of one man to deal aim, exiiciently, ihe Civil hospital alone is far more than one man f s work. Another Civil burgeon is urgently required to assist bfc. Major Carey Evans but the dlitary authorities liave not Mther- to seen their way to appoint one. 3. The Medical Officer of health (Capt. Heggs, ft.^.m.C) is responsible for the administration of sanitary services of the • city as a whole, prevention of epidemics; vaccination; visiting and inspection of all cases of infectious diseases reported in the town and contacts; exa dilation of all vessels arriving from up and down stream: proposals affecting the improvement of the health of the city population, conditions of food supply. It is out of the question for him to take executive charge of the civil Isolation hospital, and for tMs the D.M.b., hes: Ex: Force has lent tne part time services of a military M.C. from the. Military Isolation hospital. 3.11 is for tMs Officer that the charge allowance has been requested (vide my telegram 6957 August 33rd). 4. The 0.0. ganitary section (Capt. Bonham B.A.M.C.) is con cerned with all the routine, cleaning and conservancy of the town by the personnel of his Oanitary section, asvsisted by locally employed labour. T.ds includes military occupied areas as well as the whole civil town. It also includes special anti-plague work, anti-rat campai b ncampaign etc. • his Officer an allowance has also been proposed. It vail I trust be clear from the foregoing that for the work actually in hand the existing staff is xkxlx wholly in sufficient; our civil medical organisation, or rather the lack of one, is in my opinion the weakest point in our present Civil Administration. Its early improvement is a matter of urgent political importance. Quite apart from this however the whole provision for the medical needs of the city, is inadequate. I hope before long to he in a position to submit specific proposals for its improvement, and for the institution ot a civil medical organization in these territories.ironi - The Secretary to the Government of India in the foreign and rolitical department, io - The Civil Condssioner, Baghdad.

Reference your A/1507/58 July 2nd, 1917. 1, It has recently been ruled that the salaries of the D.A.A. and Q.M.G., and Staff Captain to the M.G. Baghdad are debitable to the Civil Rinds, and as a consequence, the two appointments require the sanction of the Govern ment of India. I am not entirely satisfied however that these appointments are now necessary and eonsequently before requesting the sanction of the Government of India to their continuance I think it my duty to ascertain the wishes of the G.O.C.-in-Chief on the subject and to lay before him the following observations, 2 , I attach below a statement comparing the superior establishment of the Military Governorat^^feit Baghdad and Basrah respectively. It will be observed that the superior establishment at Baghdad costs almost three times as much as the corresponding establishment atBasrah, and consists of two officers more. Again, in Basrah, the assessing of rents of billets and the administration and control of a Civil Refugee camp of some 2000 souls isfperforraed by the M.G* himself in the normal course of his duties, whereas in Baghdad rents are assessed by a standing committee consisting of three officers outside the M*G f s establish ment and an additional officer i* is detailed as 0 /C. Civil Internment Camp. The population of Basrah is smaller but the area covered (Magil to Sarraji both inclusive, and both banks of the ritfer) is very much larger as also is the number of troops within the area and the amount of work in connection therewith (e*g. compensation claims), 3, The offices of the A,M.G, Basrah and D,M.G. Ashar correspond generally to the offices of the D.M.G.E fiD.M.G«E* &amp; W* in Baghdad hut there is in Basrah no separate office for the M.G* In Baghdad however the M*G* has a separate office consisting of seven soldier clerks, four military interpreters, four civil clerks and a civil interpreter. I incline to the opinion that duties of the office could be carried out, as in Basrah by the ordinary establishment of the Municipal Office (i*e. in Baghdad, D.M*G. E«at and West), if somewhat strengthened and consider the present superior establishment of the M*G« Baghdad excessive and difficult to justify to the Government of India without further^ explanation or a specific ruling from G.H.Q. as to the establishment to bfc maintained. 4 # I believe that a very substantial reduction of Subordinate as well as superior establishment would be possible, without any loss of efficiency if an amalgamation of offices could be arranged such as that proposed in ray 11018 December 23rd. If however these proposals do not at present meet with approval I reQuest instructions as to whether the present War Establishment of the M.G. Baghdad is to be maintained now that it has to be paid from Civil FundsStatement comparing the superior establishment of the Military Governorates of Baghdad and Basrah respectively.

If they were members of the Political Department they would be on an incremental scale of pay and had they remained in military duty they would in all probability have been drawing more than they now are. They both have Assistant Political Officers working under their orders and I consider that there are strong grounds for granting them the small addition to their emoluments now proposed. I would remind the Government of India that officers of the Civil Administration do not ordinarily enjoy the prospects of temporary military promotion, and consequent increase of pay that fall to the lot of their brethren in military employ.

Government of India deprecate increasing fixed deputation (duty) allowance of R300 per mensem in indivi dual cases and on personal grounds, save in most exceptional circumstances, which do not appear to exist in cases of Captains Dickson and Wilson More over the precedent so created would inevitably prove embarrassing.

It is now understood that you consider that a deputation allowance of Rs. 300 a month should not be granted to every officer serving under your orders, as a matter of course, and that you piopose m each case in future to consider the propriety of granting a lesser sum. On this understanding the Government of India would be prepared to consider proposals for increasing the deputation allowance beyond Rs. 300 per mensem but in the following cases only :— (a) when the duties performed are of such a nature that the remuneration granted for them should not ordinarily fall below a ceitain minimum — which minimum is not reached with the deputation allow 1 ance of Rs. 300. Cb) when the officer concerned has been employed for a considerable period, and to your satisfaction without any increase m his emoluments, and has, from the fact of his employment, sacrificed chances of specia promotion. 3. If it can be shown that the case of Captain M ilson or that of Captain Dickson fall under either of these categories, the Government of India would be piepaied toNo. 1006-Est. A., dated Simla, the 14th May 1918. From— Major W. G. Neale, Assistant Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, To Captain A. T. VvIlson, C.l(l.G., C.I.E., D.S.O., Officitaing Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. The Government of India have had under consideration the question of intro ducing a uniform system for regulating the salaries of superior officers serving under the Civil Administration of the occupied territories in Mesopotamia. 2. Such officers may be divided into the following main classes :— (1) military officers who held no substantive civil appointment at the time of their transfer to employment under the Civil Administration ; (2) military officers who, at the time of their transfer, held substantive civil appointments in other Departments, e.g., the Political Depart ment of the Government of India, the Bombay Political Department, etc., but who at the time of their transfer were temporarily serving in the Army or in a Military Department ; (3) military officers who. held substantive civil appointments at the time of their transfer, and who were then actually in civil employ; (4) civil officers holding substantive civil appointments, but who, at the time of their transfer, were serving in the Indian Army Reserve of Officers ; and (5) civil officers actually holding their civil appointments at the time of their transfer to Mesopotamia. Under present arrangements, officers belonging to classes (1), (3) and (5) enu merated above continue to draw the pay and allowances which they would have drawn but for their transfer to employment under the Civil Administration, and in addition, draw the sanctioned “ Mesopotamia ” allowances. As regards cases falling under classes (2) and (4), the present practice is not uniform : some officers in addition to the “ Mesopotamia ” allo wance draw the pay and all owances to which they would have been entitled/but for their transfer to jSTesopotamia, whileX'' others draw the pay and allowances oi their military rank. 3. The Government of India have now decided that with effect from the 1st May 1918 officers belonging to classes (2) and (4) above referred to shall ordinarily draw the pay and allowances which they would have drawn in civil employ in India, but for their transfer to employment under the Civil Administration, together with such Mesopotamia ' allowance as may be sanctioned in each case. It is recog nised that the application of this rule will cause hardship to certain officers and you are therefore authorised to refer such cases, with your recommendations thereon, to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. 4. As regards future procedure, you should report, in the monthly statements prescribed under the orders* cited on the margin, all appointments! to, and reversions from, employment under the Civil Ad ministration in order to enable the Gov ernment of India to notify the formal trans fers of service of the officers affected from military to civil employ and vice versa. In cases in which you consider that the ordinary rule will operate harshly, you should add such recommendations as you may have to make regarding salary. ♦Foreign and Political Department Memo- No. 1930-Est.A., dated the 10th November 1917. flncluding appointments of Military Gov ernors and Deputy Military Governors.■ ’ 1 * &lt; ■* : f fill /7 No. 276.

I have the honour to address you on the subject of the Superintendence of the Civil Jail, Baghdad. The Army Commander sanctioned the provision of a Superintendent for the Jail in the Y/ar Establishment of the Military Governor, Baghdad, I understand that application was made to the Government of India for the services of a special officer for this purpose, hut without success. The Military Governor has accordingly been obliged to call upon the Deputy Military Governor, Baghdad East, to perform the executive functions involved, in addition to his already onerous duties as Deputy Military Governor. He is of opinion that the Deputy Military Governor cannot properly be called upon thus to hold executive charge of the Jail without remuneration, and asks me to obtain sanction for an allowance of Rs.150/- per mensem for the Superintendence of the Jail. I am of opinion that there is good reason for the grant; and request that the Government of India will be pleased to sanction it, and also to approve, in the special circumstances of the case, of its being drawn by the Deputy Military Governor, in addition to his existing emoluments. 13 o ....Copy of a memorandum No.l616-ist.A., dated the 27th September 1917, from the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla, to the Chief Political Officer, Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force, Baghdad• Your letter No.4048/166-1, dated 14th August 1917.

Nith reference to your memorandum No.l616-Est .A. , dated the 27th September 1917, I have the honour to inform you that the daily average population of the Baghdad Civil Jail during the last four months has been as follows :~ July 173. August 190. September 316. October 283. The convicts are employed as far as possible on out-door work; during the past week twenty skilled convicts have been employed by the Ordnance Department in the armourers shop, thirty two in moving ammunition and stores/, and forty in the Clothing Department. In addition eighty convicts have been employed in road making and repairs, and in road watering. Prom the above it v/ill be seen that the efficient organization of the labour resources of the Jail requires the constant attention of the Superintendent, especially as all guards have to be provided from the Warder establish ment, and the proposed allowance of Es.150/- per mensem appears to be iudtified.f Copy of a memorandum Eo.^27-5st.A., dated the 24th January 1918, from the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign &amp; Political Department, Delhi, to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. lour memorandum 7868/166-4, dated the 31st October 1917 Deputy Military Governor, Baghdad East, may, in addition to his other employments, draw duty allowance of Rs.150 a month for Superintendence of the Civil Jail, Baghdad, in addition to his own duties.Copy.

At that time these were considered as 'local Fund Accounts' and consequently the allowance was not submitted for the sanction of Government. At the conference held at Simla in June and July 1916, it was decided that the general rules proposed for the control of expenditure chargeable to the general revenues of the Occupied Territories should also be applicable to expenditure charged against funds in the hands of the Controller Hostile Trading Concerns.

I would ask that the General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, may be informed that the proposals contained in the above telegram are cancelled so far as concerns the officers serving under my orders, and that he may be authorised to lend me ten more officers for duty under me, the demand(s) on this Force for officers from India being proportionately reduced.Draft Paper.

T. Wilson, Captain, Deputy Chief Political Officer.Ike Blockad e pX er j_e.my territory . Prom the moment occupied Basrah a blockade was enforced as strictly as circumstances permitted, and maintained until the capture of Nasiriyah* Amarah and Kut made it, for the time being superfluous* It was re-established in Februery of the present year on a strict basis, the following being the lines on which it is worked (D In Irad c A Blockade Officer, working under the orders of the C*P.G. prevents by means of armed posts, any goods leaving Basrah by water unless furnished with a pass signed by him. A copy of this pass is sent to the A.P.Go of the town of destination if there is one, end cash security is taken for the safe delivery of the goods to the town in question. This security is not released uhtil the A.P.G. telegraphs that goods have been duly f received. Goods are very sparingly issued for places ^ where there is no A.P.G. and the Sheikh’s signature has to be accepted in Jieu of the A.P.G’s. Amounts of goods which are allowed to be sent to each place are calculated on local requirements and the A.P.O. concerned fixes these amounts at his discretion. At each place where there are troops, such as All Gharbi, Amarah, Qilat Saleh and Qurnah a strict watch is kept on all goods leaving and exporters have to produce proofs of friendly desoina- tion. The system involves considerable labour, but it has been proved demonstrably successful in preventing goods from reaching the enemy from the occupied territories. (2) Restrictio n of i mports into, jmsm. tHrm° r y from Arab side . The assistance of the Sheikhs of Zubeir, Koweit, Bahrein, Qatar and the Trucial Coast has been enlisted, and the co-operation of the Political Agents at Zubair, Koweit and Bahrein and of the Residency Agent at Sargah obtained, to prevent goods leaving for other than friendly destination, end to impose such?§&gt;( / » i estrictions on goods, even Tor friendly destinations as will guarantee that no considerable quantity is likely ! reach the enemy. Ibn Sa'oud has likewise offered every assistance in encompassing this end, and there is no reason to think any appreciable quantity of goods finds its way into enemy territory on this side. (3) Restriction of import s into enemy territory through hersip . This is the weakest part of the blockade. Without blockading Persia as a whole it is not possible to prevent the import of goods into Baghdad from Persia, and, untilZ the occupation of Kerman shah it seems certain that considerable quantities of piece goods matches oil sugar etc. reached Baghdad in this way; and even after the capture of Kermanshah it seem^coubtful whether the steps (if any) taken by the rtrsians to blockade enemy territory were successful.. Since the advance on Qasr-i- Shir in and Ifendali, however, the position is probably improved. Another aspect of the problem which has caused trouble is the difficulty of preventing imports from points in Persian territory, such as Bizful, through PUsht-i-Kuh to Bedrai; or from Hawizeh, through the marshes, across the Tigris below Amarah, in3° marshes, and thus to the ! T ai« Amounts so transported, however, are undoubtedly quite small. ( 4 ) Local restr ictions on sale of oil and Patr ol. Only two firms stock Kerosine oil and only one stocks petrol. They are only allowed to sell to approved buyers and they provide weekly returns of sales to the Military Governor. * * * * * * A proposal was made in February last to enforce a partial blockade of Persian territory with a view to bringing pressure to bear on districts then in enemy’s hands. The advance of the Pu-sians Ramadan, and Ispahan in Ranch,end the collapse of the German intrigues at Shiraz in the fallowing m °nth # rendered it unnecessary to pursue the matter which has now 'been dropped.Prom - The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign &amp; Polltleal Department * # To - The Chief Politieal Cffieer, Basra. 1 i 44 Memorandum V*o •; £) £ 3 E»t .A, ^ Octoher &lt; Dated Simla, the ^eqrbapheor 1917.

To The Deputy Secretary 6^ Foreign and 17 AUG 1917 to the Government of Indi Political Department, Rjl-I JiJU a &gt; 21 SEP 1917 Sir, I am directed by the Chief Political Officer to submit on his behalf for the consideration of the Government of India the following request that officers serving in these territories as Assistant Commissioners of Police may, with effect from 1st April next, be paid a remunerative allowance at the rate of Rs. 300/- snd not Rs. 200/- per mensem, as at present. I am to urge in support of this application the following considerations i (1) That with one exception, all Assistant Commissioners of Police in these territories are Lieutenants or 2nd Lieutenants in the I.A.R. who, by taking up posts under this office, forfeit, under existing rules, their prospects ofof promotion to the rank of temporary Captain and of the increase of pay that such temporary promotion carries. (2) That the work they do is not less responsible or exacting than that of many other officers serving under this office who draw an allowance of Rs. 300A a month. (3) The Chief Political Officer considers it undesirable that there should be two rates of allowance for officers of the Army serving under this office. 2. I am to add that considerable difficulty is being experienced in obtaining officers for duty as Assistant Commissioners of Police as suitable candidates are unwilling to accept these posts in which their Kgjcttz work is more exacting and often less attractive and their prospects less favourable than in their own units.

General Officer Commanding, Force “ D,” telegraphs LG. 2857, 22nd May You are, 1 think, aware that Captain Lawrence was recently deputed here temporarily from Lgypt in connection with certain projects of which the Arab Bureau was one. From conversations held with him it would appear that the fact that the conduct of it has been retained in hands of Director of Military Intelligence has given us a somewhat erroneous impression oJ the status and objects of the Bureau which we had regarded as mainly a war measure. In view of modified aspec f in which institution is presented to us by Lawrence, I propose that Miss Gertrude Bell and not Major Blaker should act as corresponding officer for Mesopotamia. To this end I contemplate if there is no objection giving her definite official status by Force Routine Order and placing her services at Oox’s disposal granting her a fixed allowance a month for them. Cox and Lawrence who discussed the suggestion are of opinion that Miss Bell is well qualified for the task and her assumption of duties would be agreeable to Cairo and ourselves. She herself is quite prepared primd facie to fall in with the arrangement in which I trust the Government of India will concur.” \Ye agree. High Commissioner has been informed.
