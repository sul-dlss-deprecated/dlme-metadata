Wen the army disintegrated, as it did nearly everywhere, thousands of men sold their rifles or kept them for private use. In Kermanshah area the process was observed by our forces who recovered some rifles. Bushire reports men deserting with rifles and even a machine gun. Shiraz telegraphs that Qashgais have plundered many villages, and I have no doubt they have arms. The insecurity round Heshed has been reported already. 2. Military Attache has several times urged the Minister for Jar to ls^P* unde.] with the disintegration of the army, but the Minister does not even admit it has disintegrated. To deal with the disorder which is now occurring on a large scale, some.armed force, additional to the gendarmerie, will be required. To try to restore the huge ill-paid conscript army under ^corrupt officers is impossible, even if it. was: desirable. One of the first reforms to be announced should be, I consider, the abolition of conscription, which has been [grp. unde.] of tyranny and corruption. What is wanted is much smaller but far better paid force than before, recruitment on a voluntary basis. Many Persians are of this opinion, and I shall support it unless I receive instructions to the contrary. The Military Attache agrees, but adds that unless the Shah is going to run it the force would have to have foreign assistance. The-Shah is not running anything at present, and has done nothing whatever to try to arrest the disintegration which has occurred. On the other hand, he has just ordered some useless building operations for himself to be continued and is asking whether he cannot send someone to the north to see how his estates are getting on.i 4./ OUTWARD TELEGRAM [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be kept under Lock and Key.] [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should he retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on] E.5611/3326/34.

While'I note from your telegram No. 729 [of 13th September], that Persians are showing ostensible good will the fact remains that only 80 Germans left on first trains and that no arrangements at all appear to be in progress for the closing and removal of the German or other Legations. In fact the Persian Government seem to be allowing the German Minister to conduct diplomatic business as usual. 2. It is obviously impossible for us to let matters drag on like this. Since good will is not enough if accompanied by extreme inefficiency, we proposed to the Soviet Government yesterday evening that a joint advance should be made on Tehran forthwith and that the local commanders should arrange for the simultaneous arrival of equal forces. 3. The above is for your personal information and guidance only and you should not at this stage make any communication to the Persian Government. I realise that there is a risk that the action now proposed may result in the Government's resignation, but we should aim at getting rid of the Shah and retaining present government. Men the advance takes place you should therefore do all you can to persuade the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary to remain in office. You can point out to them that we appreciate the good will that they have shown and realise that their efforts have been nullified by the present ruler and Grown Prince. You can add that our action in no way alters^uF desire to^conclude a treaty of alliance; indeed we hope that the speedy removal of the Axis Legations and communities will clear the way for such negotiations.'—————— lAAmttMY OHAWTUO i biuoria bii£ ^fldmrnsYoO a'^aaUM olisa^liS aiH 1 c arii ^ 2 Air if* Pending arrival of Allied forces you should keep up pressure hy every means for removal of maximum number of Axis communities and for closing and removal of Axis Legations# You have full authority to make clear to Persian Government our extreme dissatisfaction at the present rate of progress, which we cannot tolerate## FILE COPY allotted xo Sx tornal Popart mentJ o' 4 1 Co-pies C.ii»cu latgTr ? -— E T y r i o SECRET, &amp; ,y 6S - r J n h ytto 1471 DK CY PH KH OF f j?

I ASKED the Soviet Ambassador to come to see me this afternoon, when I said that we had just received information from Tehran which showed that the Persian Government had accepted our terms, i.e., the closing of the foreign legations and the handing over of the German colony to us. I said that this must cause us to reconsider the plan of action we had agreed this morning. The Ambassador concurred and added that his telegram had not yet been despatched. After further examination of the position his Excellency agreed to the line of policy proposed in the attached draft telegram as an intermediate step. He would advise his Government in this sense. 2. M. Maisky then asked me what our attitude now was towards the occupation of Tehran. I said that two possibilities were open to us. Either the Persians would fail, despite their undertaking, to hand over the Germans within the time specified and to close the legations, in which event our march to Tehran would continue, or, alternatively, they would fulfil their part of the bargain, in which event we should, if we wished to continue our advance to Tehran, be compelled to find some fresh reason for so doing. It seemed possible that the Persian Government’s improved attitude was due to the hopes we were now holding out in our propaganda of constitutional reform. This had appeared to give the politicians some courage as against the Shah. Perhaps the best solution of all would be if the Persian politicians were to invite us into Tehran in order to carry through a coup d'Etat to get rid of the Shah. The Ambassador admitted that this would be good. 3. I told his Excellency that the whole situation was to be further reviewed at the Defence Committee to-night and that I would report our conclusions to him to-morrow morning. I am, &amp;c.

I ASKED the Soviet Ambassador to come to see me this morning, when we examined the situation in Persia. After some discussion we agreed on the despatch of the attached telegram. The Ambassador undertook to ask his Government to concert their action with ours. 2. I then told his Excellency that we had been considering the necessity of continuing the advance of the Allied forces to Tehran. The action proposed in this telegram could be taken meanwhile by our representatives. In order to save time we agreed, however, that in the event of his Government approving the course of action proposed, including the advance to Tehran, the Soviet authorities should instruct their commander in Persia to get into touch with ours and concert plans and agree dates for action. 3. I told his Excellency that I thought it desirable, if the move to Tehran took place, that our entry into the capital should be joint, and that our forces should be of approximate equal size. The Ambassador agreed, and said that he would report in this sense to his Government. I am, &amp;c. ANTHONY EDEN. Enclosure. Mr. Eden to Sir R. Bullard (Tehran). (No. 650. Secret. Most Immediate.)

Following are instructions for your next communication to Persian Govern ment, to be made as soon as your Soviet colleague receives his instructions :— Proposed redraft about administrative arrangements in occupied territory is acceptable. 2. His Majesty’s Government take note of statement that Minister for Foreign Affairs sees no difficulty in breaking off relations with the four Powers named, i.e., Germany, Italy, Hungary and Roumania. Action on this point should be taken at once, and at latest within forty-eight hours of delivery of your note. 3. If Soviet Government agree, His Majesty’s Government are willing to accept internment in Persia of non-official German community, subject to proper safeguards. So far as His Majesty’s Government are concerned, they agree to Ahwaz as place of internment. Germans must in fact be guarded 'by Allied authorities, although a few Persian guards might be nominally attached to the internment camps. 4. We should have to make the following further conditions : — (a) Arrangement will apply to German and Italian (repeat and Italian) communities, and to any other European resident in Persia whom the British or Soviet authorities may wish to intern. It will not apply to the refugees from Palestine, Syria and Iraq, who should be handed over unconditionally to British authorities for disposal. (b) All arrangements for guarding the internment camp will be made by the British and Soviet military authorities, and the Persian guards will lie under the orders of the British milit ary iqpbnrii-if^ -,- [22- ENCLOSE IN WEEKLY LETTL R No. 42 18 OCT 1941 FROM SECRETARY, EXTERNAL DEPT,, INDIA OFFICE2 mam (c) Nothing in the proposed arrangement shall prevent the British military authorities from releasing any interned persons at any time, or from transporting such persons out of Persia with their own consent. His Majesty’s Government would probably not wish to retain in intern ment men past military age or women and children, who would in suitable cases be returned to Germany. ^ (d) The British military authorities shall be at liberty to remove the internees in question from Persia for further internment elsewhere if at any time developments in the situation should make this necessary. 5. The rounding up of the Germans in Tehran and elsewhere must be complete within forty-eight hours of your communication to the Persian Government. In addition, the handing over of the Germans at the internment centres selected must be in effective process of execution within that period. 6. Since His Majesty’s Government are prepared to meet the Persian Government’s wishes on this point, they must make it plain that they do so on the assumption that suitable reforms should at once be introduced into the Persian Administration. His Majesty’s Government have no wish to intervene unnecessarily in Persian internal affairs, but it is clearly difficult for them to co-operate fully with an Administration which has long ceased to represent the wishes and the true interests of the people of Persia. They must therefore ask that steps should at once be taken to abolish the system of arbitratory exactions which has deprived the Persian people of their freedom and has in practice nullified the Persian Constitution. You should concert with your Soviet colleague and act on the above instruc tions as soon as he has received corresponding instructions.

Foreign Office, September 8, 1941. ’ THE Soviet Ambassador asked to see me this afternoon when he said that ,n Sir A. Cadogan had recently enquired of him what the Soviet Governme considered to be the time-limit for the handing over of the Germans m Tehian a*&gt; Jof to us. His Excellency said that he had consulted his Government. They had replied that originally we had given a time-limit of a week from the 30th Augr for the Germans to be expelled. His Government considered that this time-limit should now apply to the handing over of the Germans, and since the time-limi had now expired the Soviet Government held that our attitude 110W a the Germans should be handed over at once. The Ambassador added that he had seen the Persian reply suggesting the internment of the Germans under joint Soviet-British-Persian control. His Government did not agree with this compromise. . . . w ^ ^ r&gt; 2. I told his Excellency that I had been giving some thought to this Persian problem over the week-end. It was difficult to escape the conviction that the Persians were now playing with us in the pretexts they were raising and the delavs they were creating in dealing with the Germans. Or it might be, of se ’ that the Persians were too terrified of the Germans to take any action them selves against them in Tehran. In any event, I had no confidence that, whatever thev said, the Persians would, in fact, now act effectively against the Germans in their midst. In these conditions we had been examining this morning possible alternative courses, and, though I was not at present in a position to commit His Majesty’s Government, I would like to tell him at once my own view, which the Prime Minister had just told me that he shared, that the matter could only be effectively dealt with by a temporary Anglo-Soviet entry into Tehran. We could then assume control of the Germans ourselves. If such an occupation of Tehran were thought necessary by our two Governments. I hoped that the Soviet Government would agree that it should be joint and that our forces should be of equal size. 3. The Ambassador said that, while he had no instructions from his Govern ment, his own view was that they would agree with the conclusion to which I had come. , Indeed, in one of the telegrams which he had recently received from them, he had the impression that the mind of his Government was moving that way. We agreed that M. Maisky should inform his Government of what I had said, and that I would telephone to him after the Cabinet to tell him whether the view I had expressed was to be regarded as the accepted policy of His Majesty’s Government. His Excellency continued that, if a joint entry were decided upon, the policy would have the added advantage of dealing with the foreign missions there. His Government agreed that the Bulgarian Legation should be closed, but they would be glad if we would take such action, since Soviet Russia had not broken off relations with Bulgaria. The Soviet Government also asked that the Finnish Consulate at Tehran' should be closed. Soviet Russia was at war with Finland, and the presence of that consulate in Tehran was undesirable. I said that we would agree to this. 4. M. Maisky continued that the Soviet Ambassador at Tehran had reported that, in his conversation with the Political Director of the Persian Foreign Office, the latter had urged the Soviet Government to accept a com promise in respect of the Germans in Tehran on the grounds that, if we pressed our demands beyond a certain point, the Government would collapse. What did I think of this argument? I replied that the position might well be as the Political Director had said, but, if so, this was really another argument for a joint entry into Tehran. Once there, it should not be impossible for us to set up [21—59] RECo-POUDCPr. ENCLOSE IN WEEKLY LETTER ^ / S£H 941 No. 39 2 7 SEP 1941 INDIA OFFICE FROM SECRETARY, EXTERNAL DEPT., - i. INDIA OFFICEa form of government which should be friendly. We could hardly hope to do so from outside the capital. M. Maisky agreed. 5. The Ambassador than mentioned that, in conversation with the Soviet Ambassador at Tehran, Sir R. Bullard had suggested that he favoured the choice of the Shah’s third son as a possible candidate for the throne in the event of the Shah having to be disposed of. Did I, his Excellency asked, share this view? I replied that this was the first I had heard of this particular candidate, though there was a number of possibilities. If our troops had to enter Tehran, it was* my hope that the Sh^h would flee, after the style of our James II, and disembarrass us accordingly. If this happened, our two Governments could consult together about a ? successor, but in the meanwhile it should be possible' for a Government to be formed. For my part, I hoped that the present Prime Minister would continue to serve, since he was almost the only Persian politician who enjoyed a measure of public support. M. Maisky agreed that it was desirable that M. Faroughi should continue as the head of a Government, if this were at all possible. I am, &amp;c.

Cb) We should noi get a better Cabinet if any. Prime Minister s name carries great weight. Minister for Foreign Aflairs has shown great desire to meet our wishes in practical t matters P for example whenever granting facilities in connexion with consignment of jute in transit from India to roissia,, both seem anxious to co-operate loyally in order tc give no excuse for extension or prolongation of foreign occupation^ 5 6 „ ,[ c ) Allied occupation of Tehran is to be avoided not • lor the sake of mie^Persians but because it would involve heavy responsibilities for our Governments. Many mdispensabi.es would flee and administration already weak would probably break down* Allies would have to intervene to keep Government going and the difference of outlook would make condominium very difficult to run. „„ t, Minister for Foreign Affairs raised a minor point. He found your reply on first paragraph (b) about civil administration unnecessarily severe and indeed it is stronger than Soviet wording. My immediately following telegram contains alternative draft for your approval. 5. Minister for Foreign Affairs said that if his suggestion for internment of Germans in Persia was accepted, he believed our proposals would go through. He would not say positively that otherwise the Cabinet would resign but we believe that it would. We have considered his suggestion as possibly containing German trap but if we can choose places oi internment for example Meshed and Ahwaz for dangerous Germans, risk of escape even in case of German invasion of Persia would be^slight* As it is a quite new suggestion ^ so much depends on it I hope [group omitted ? to be] excused for putting it forward*TO Bl kept under lock and key.

THE COMMITTEE discussed, in the light^of the Persian offer to intern all the Germans in Persia, what our next step should be# There was general agreement that sooner or later we should have to occupy the main points on the railwayacross Persia, including Tehran# SIR JOHN DILL considered, and SIR ARCHIBALD WAVSLL agreed, that we could occupy Tehran at once with a small force of about two brigades, one of which would be semi-armoured# It would probably take this brigade about two days to reach the capital# If, however, we had to occupy the greater part of the country it would be a serious military commitment. It was thought that the Persian offer of internment might only be further procrastination, and reference was made to the dangerous effects of delay in clearing up the position in Persia on the Turks. MR. AMERY suggested that we might use the threat of the military occupation of Tehran to make the Persians comply with our wishes, but there was general agreement that preparations should be put in hand forthwith for a joint advance by ourselves and the Russians on Tehran# MR. EDM drew attention to the desirability of removing the Shah, and it v/as agreed that h..s removal would facilitate much needed reforms in Persia. THE PRIME MINISTER, in summing up, said that we should accept the Persian offer to intern the Germans in Persia, 'orovided that definite action to this end was instituted within 48 hours. We should be willing to consider further questions of exchange, and means of allowing non-military personnel to be sent to Germany# In addition to this we should say to the Persians that there were other issues^ connected with the wellbeing of the Government a.nd to this end there must be reform* At the same time, now ever, orders should be given to our troops to advance to Tehran,^ and arrangements should be made with the Russians xor tnem to move forward simultaneously a force of the same size to the capital, the detailed arrangements being made by the local Miiitary Commanders. THE COMMITTEE (a) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to send the necessary instructions to our Minister at Tehran to carry out the policy as outlined by the Prime Minister at ’X’; (b) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to inform the Soviet Government of the action we proposed to take, and to invite their co-operation;(c) Invited the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to send the necessary instructions for our troops to advance to Tehran in conjunction with the Russians at the earliest opportunity; (d) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to arrange for propagand to he begun forthwith on the necessity for reforms in the Persian Government.

I should like your views on the following points and on others which will no doubt occur to you. (1) Would the. disappearance of the Shah increase the present disintegration of Persian administration ? (2) If he goes, what form of government do you think would be possible ? Could there be a Council of Regency, and if so, do you see any reasonably satisfactory candidates ? ^ (3) If a change of this kind took place, would the present Prime Minister or a similar administration carry on ?

Please repeat to Moscow as my telegram No. 197* Instructions reached Soviet Ambassador only this morning. To save time we made representations to Minister for Foreign Affairs orally an hour or two later. To explain and justify our demand for the removal of the five legations, which Minister for Foreign Affairs naturally found inconsistent with our exhortations to neutrality, we made a statement on the lines suggested in paragraph 1 of my telegram No. 655. Soviet Ambassador left me to request removal of Bulgarian Legation as his Government, while approving its removal, does not wish to be concerned in request that it should be removed. 2. Minister for Foreign Affairs said that in his opinion it would be quite easy to get rid of the three minor legations by Persian Government s own methods, that Italian Minister had recently told him that if the road was open he would send away all his community and follow them, and that even the German Legation could be got rid of if the German community wore allowed to go ho^^&lt; YTe pointed out that our instructions about handing over of &amp; [? grps pmit.] Soviet authorities were now quite definite (Soviet instructions on this point reached the Anbassador only yesterday) and that the legations must go very soon end not as part of a bargain but because the two Governments were determined that they should go. which not only has to contend with difficulties resulting from the occupation but also with criticisms of the public who accuso them of having sold their country. I have no doubt that their difficulties are great but we did not encourage the Minister for Foreign Affairs to think that there could be any modification of terms. We are both inclined to think that the Government will resign on the ground that they are not able to carry out such conditions. At any rate the Prime Minister, who is really ill, could hardly carry a cabinet through such a difficult task.

Your telegrams Nos. 648 and 649 [of 2nd September. . • Persian Government's reply to Anglo-Soviet terms]. It is essential that the Persian Government should talce immediate steps to fulfil our requirements as regards handing over the German community, the Axis Legations, the Mufti and other Palestinian, Iraqi and Syrian refugees. We must not allow procrastination on these essential points while the Persian Government send us diplomatic documents dealing with many other less urgent matters. 2. Subject to the foregoing consideration and to the instructions which may eventually reach your Soviet colleague, you may take the following line with regard to the matters raised in the Persian Note of 1st September# 3# Paragraph 1. (a). While His Majesty's Government are not prepared to exclude any specific towns from the areas of occupation already conveyed to Persian Government, they would see no objection in principle to a local arrangement between the British military authorities and the Persian authorities concerned whereby a certain number of Persian troops or gendarmerie would be stationed at Dizful, Khorramabad and Kermanshah for the purpose of maintaining order# This arrangement would however be subject to revision if necessitated by British military requirements, (b). In the occupied areas, it will be necessary for the Persian administrative authorities to carry on their functions in close co-operationwith the British military authorities, who will on their side endeavour to meet the reasonable wishes of the Persian administrative authorities so far as this may be compatible with British military requirements* (c). The British military authorities have no desire to be a charge on the Persian Government for food, accommodation or other needs, and arrangements will be made by them, in close co-operation v/ith the Persian administrative authorities, for procuring these commodities, if this is essential for British military requirements, in such a way as to obviate hardship to the country. (d). Every possible step will be taken to avoid regrettable incidents between the British occupying forces and the local, inhabitants. Paragraph 2. See instructions in my telegrams Nos. 612 and 615 [of 2nd September]. 5. Paragraph 3. We agree that restriction on future entry of Germans into Persia applies only to the duration of hostilities v/ith Germany. 6. Paragraph The facilities required for the transit of goods and v/ar material will be determined by military requirements, but the Persian Government may be assured that steps will be taken to supplement and improve the means of communication now available and every endeavour v/ill be made not to cause hardship to the Persian Government and people. 7. Paragraph 5. V/e agree. 8. Paragraph 6. We sympathise with the Persian Government’s request that our economic help should include the purchase of Persian exports an&amp; we shall do what we can to meet this request. As regards the further request for the-release of goods belonging to Persia which are now on British territory, it will be necessary to consider individual cases on their merits, but we will endeavour to release such goods wherever possible. 9. Paragraph 9. His Majesty's Government will be prepared to consider the return in due course of captured arms and muntions of war, and will also be prepared to examine, when the British occupying forces are withdrawn from Persia, any reasonable claims v/hich the Persian Government may wish to put forward for compensation on account of damage suffered by Persian nationals during the occupation.DIRECT(m) ^^[This telegram is of particular secrecy and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on.] [CYPHER] WAR CiiBINET DISTRIBUTION.

Our original demand was that Germans should be sent away from Persia within a week. Owing to later developments, this was changed to a demand that they should be handed over to British or Russian forces. The week’s notice expires on 6th September. It is realised that in present conditions it is physically impossible for so many Germans to be moved within the period stated but you should insist in concert with your Russian colleague that we must have by 7th September an acceptance of our revised demand and that steps must at once be taken to carry out that demand. For instance a list of Germans should be given to us at once and a start should be made in removing for handing over to us those Germans who are in Tehran, whether they are in German Legation or not.OUTWARD TELEGRAM [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be kept under Lock and Key.] [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should be retained By the authorised recipient and not passed on] 3 /G.

You are aware that we have long been held responsible for. the Shah ; s misdeeds. This universal belief has been strengthened by the fact that the Shah after being severely f, a ^^° rl f S . and ° n the ^P cint of abdicating or running away is again firmly m power. It was believed that we could not come to this country with troops and dictate an agreement and nf t] ? e P e °P^ e under, tneir greedy tyrant. Their conception of constitutional Government is vague but they feel that it meanq S S m L forril G °ntrol so as to prevent diversion of the resources of the country into the pockets of one man and to.protect the life and property of the individual and unless we give some encourage ment to this idea we shall be suspected of usin^ our mi 1 itary power to support the Shah.

Our friends among the Persians are in. despair because, whereas in spite of our invasion, our popularity had increased (party because we behaved so much better than the Russians and partly because the rule of the Shah seemed shaken) the tide has turned strongly against us because the Shah is behaving as before. Cannot we broadcast from London and Delhi some such statement as this? Begins. Recently Tehran radio for the first time for ^ a very long while referred to the constitutional Government of Persia. This reference to the constitution seems to have aroused the greatest interest throughout Persia where it is proposed^that great changes of administrative control of public finances etc. may be contemplated. Ends. This would be sufficient to encourage the Cabinet and the people and to make the Shah hesitate. Some expert might for example give historical talk about the brighter side of the Constitutional Government in Persia or something of the kind. 3. Except for one or two minor members, the present. Cabinet ^■ s l- 6 r ?. undec. ?quarrelsome ], One has been at loggerheads and degraded, three have sent me an emissary to tell me that the Shan is impossible and the Prime Minister who is ill with worry says the Shah is incorrigible. These people are expected to turn out the Germans while the whole population is hostile to us as supporters of the Shah. .L. We really must show some sympathy with popular opinion in Persia or the weight of hostility to us will clog all our efforts. This is not [grp. undec.] opinion of one man: it is the opinion of all our Persian allied, and neutral friends and of my staff without exception - Counsellor, Diplomatic [grp. undec. ?adviser] and Commercial Secretaries, Military Attaches and Press AttachSs. Indeed my staff and I have now got to the.point when we believe the Shah is in fact incorrigible but to-begin with, some sign of sympathy for the population might be made.

It was at first difficult to assess local reaction to our action in Persia but it is now clear that great majority of* influential persons in this country are reacting favourably. I have it on good authority that Amir Faisal expressed his complete approval as soon as he learned the news and he would not have taken such a definite line unless he was sure that Ton Saud would approve, 2. This favourable reaction is I think largely due to fact that Wahabis and other orthodox Moslems have long disapproved of Shah for restrictions placed by him in Persia on what they consider to be proper practice of Islam.

Policy now proposed is perfectly justified in the circumstances. Unfortunately it is at variance with what was said to the Persian Government in writing on basis of your telegram No. 575, and your paragraph 3 does not help since our written communication proposed occupation zones which did not . include.Tehran yet suggested no restriction on Axis Missions here except for members of the German Legation v/ho were not bona fide. To explain our change of policy we could make the following true statement: Whereas the Allies have tried to embarrass the Persian Government as little as possible and have therefore left Tehran outside the zones of occupation, German and Italian Legations taking advantage of this generosity are doing all they can to har/ass and weaken the Persian Government, by propaganda both here and from Germany and Italy, by intrigues with refugees from Iraq, by maintaining wireless transmitting sets in the Legations etc. 2. As soon as my Soviet colleague receives his instructions we will make new demands using (provided he agrees) [grp.omitted ?argument] and explanation suggested above. 3. It would not be surprising if the Cabinet resigned rather than try to carry out our new policy though they seem to be anxious to do their best for their country and want above all things to avoid Russian occupation of Tehran. They need support however and we can best afford that in the manner suggested in ray telegram No. 650. If we give [?grp.omitted] and Cabinet and population some hope that the greed and tyranny of the Shah are to be restrained they will worry less about having to get rid of German and other enemy Legations. Coincidence between restrictions on the Shah and departure of our enemies should have excellent effect on our reputation here.

(He had evidently given the impression ^that he was prepared to agree to German request. You will remember that he told me that he had agreed in principle: see second paragraph of same telegram) ^ , 2. After our conversation reported in my telegram No.2124^ he had informed the German Embassy m writing that he could hot accent their request and he had sent instructions accordingly to Chargd d‘Affaires Tehran. 5, A secretary of the German Embassy had subsequently called on him and urged that he should allow Germans m Tehran to take refuge in Turkish Embassy. He had replied that this was impossible. I had informed him that His Male sty s Government were entirely opposed to anything of the kind and in doing so I had expressed the view that there was little danger of an occupation of Tehran. I had also assured him that His Majesty's Government v/ould not allow a massacre of Germans in Tehran and that in general there was no danger such as to justify Turkish Government in allowing Germans to take refuge in TurKish Embassy. German secretary appeared to be satisfied. 4. Minister for Foreign Affairs assured me that there were no Germans in Turkish Embassy in Tehran. He was no doubt speaking from such information as is in his possession and this may not tally closely with second paragraph of Tehran telegram No. qfh i.

Many hundreds of rifles have thus fallen into the hands of the riffraff or tribesmen, and fears that there may be attacks and looting have been aroused among large percentage of the population of Kermanshah and the surrounding district. G.O.C. British forces ordered curfew as from 9 p.m. on September 1st, and this has done much to restore confidence. Steps to collect Persian rifles are also being taken, but hundreds of rifles may easily elude the authorities' search. i The attitude of most officers and of a still considerable percentage of the.town population continues to be hostile, and efforts are likely to be made increasingly to hinder rhe ^ task of the British military authorities and of the Persians who may attempt to co-operate with them. As [grp. undec. ? Governor*sj authority here, never great under noimal conditions, is now reduced almost to nil by passive resistance and by defection of gendarmerie and troops, the British authorities may be obliged to intervene in order to prevent outbreaks of disorder, which might easily result from a break-down of the Persian administrative machinery here.Ill 1 1 ' [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on].

War Offic-e telegram to Military Mtachd Tehran No. 87294., I find it difficult to reconcile this telegram with instructions contained in your telegrams Nos. 575 and 587. It suggests return to the policy during the last war when we had large forces in various parts of Persia and spent many millions a ^year on them. I had supposed that the policy was to limit our* military commitments to the minimum, and to rely (at least until our reliance should be proved to be unjustified) on a 'stable and friendly Government' for co-operation. I admit paragraph 2 (d) of your telegram No. 575 about transit trade indicates some latitude, but there is nothing in the instructions on which I am now negotiating (my telegram No. 634-) to justify paragraph (3) of above-mentioned telegram from the 'War Office. 2 . I submit that policy indicated in that paragraph ( 3 ) is one which the Russians would be only too willing to adopt. They would fill the north with troops and send out advance guards all over the place, and as it is unlikely that the Persian civil administration will be able to function freely within the Russian line, the whole of the north, including eventually Tehran, would come under direct or indirect Russian rule. In these circumstances no Persian Government which was friendly could be strong. 3 3 I had drafted to this point when I received telegram No. 4-639 from Government of India to Secretary of State for India. Paragraph 2 (a) expresses my views exactly. The administration is already shaken by the nearness of the Russians to Tehran on both sides and needs all the support we can give it. 4-.

Persian Government agrees to the request that they should hand Germans over to His Majesty's Government or the Soviet Governmentr On humanitarian grounds and because they know the Germans would much prefer it, they would rather hand them over to us. I have arranged provisionally that they should be sent bv rail to Ahwaz. They could perhaps be housed on enemy ships while awaiting shipment to India. 2. The Germans are terrified lest they should be handed over to the Russians. My Soviet colleague is delighted to be used to scare them and with the fear of Siberia in the back ground, I have some hope that the Germans will agree to hand themselves over to us in a body. This, however, may be optimistic, and I have warned the Persian Government that they are responsible and in the meantime committee consisting of British and Soviet Counsellors and Director-General of Ministry of Foreign Affairs begin September 1st the work of preparing lists. 3.

Prime Minister promised reply by 1st September or at the latest 2nd September. It will agree to our proposals in principle and it is dear none of the points which it will raise will be allowed to prevent settlement. The reply will ask whether the Persian Government's interpretation of certain clauses is correct and [grp. unde.] appear to me so reasonable that I shall not telegraph them until the reply is received. The reply will also ask (1) whether British and Soviet Governments undertake to return any arms and munitions captured from or handed over by the Persian forces and ( 2 ) whether certain modifications in the limits of occupied areas cannot be made. 2. The Persian Government particularly want the Soviet troops to be kept further away from Tehran. They suggest that the West of the line should run from Zinjan to Resht and then eastward along the shore of the Caspian and straight to Aliabad leaving Kazvin, Semnan and Shahrud unoccupied. I agree that it is bad for the Persian Government to have the Soviet troops so near Tehran but I took of course no part in the discussion on this point. As to our area, the Persian Government ask whether it is essential that we should hold Khorramabad, Dizful and Shustar. I pointed out the difficulty of protecting Hasjed-i-Suleiman otherwise, but the Prime Minister spoke of tribal complications. Hy impression is however that although the Shah is undoubtedly sensitive about the tribes, the Persian Government are asking us for this concession mainly because it would be invidious to seek concessions from the Soviet Government alone. 3. In a three hour discussion with the Soviet Ambassador and myself, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs showed imagination, good sense and goodwill.

The Persian Government and people, I am confident, understood in their hearts the motive of our action.

They are not extravagant and they are of course only temporary. Meanwhile let me make plain once again our general attitude. We have no territorial claims against Persia, We covet no square inch of Persian territory* We have no design nor have our Russian allies any design to annex any part of the areas which our forces have now occupied. His Majesty’s Government and the Soviet Government have repeatedly assured the Persian Government of their determination ^bo respect the oolitical independence and the territorial integrity of'Persia.

We shall, as soon as military conditions Hermit, withdraw our forces from Persian territory. Neither' we nor the Soviet Government wish to seize any part of Persia.

They have been forced to take military measures by fact that the Persian Government have paid no heed to their friendly representations, but these measures are not directed against Persia herself., only against the menace arising from the potential activities of the Germans established in key posts throughout the country. If now the Persian Government are prepared to co-operate, there is no reason why hostilities should continue. 2.

These requirements are as follows RECd. POL.

In the north the Persians should withdraw from the area Bazargan-Maku-Khoi-Sherif Khaneh, thence to Maragheh-luanelv to mouth of river Safid-Rud, all inclusive., The places specified above will be occupied temporarily by British and Russian forces. „ (b) the Persian Government should send av/ay from Persia within one week all the German ~'\ community except the bona fide staff of the vd- German Legation, and a few technicians not ’ ^ employed on coramunications-; and should furnish lists of the Germans in question to be agreed with the British and Soviet: Missions at Tehran.

(d) The Persian Government should under take to place no obstacle in the way of the despatch of supplies, including war material, across Persian territory between the British and Russian forces; ...and should undertake to facilitate the despatch of such supplies by road, railway or air. 3* In return the British and Soviet Govern ments will agree (a) to continue payments due to Persia on account of oil royalties etc., as in the past: (b) to continue zo facilitate the supply to Persia of her economic requirements, and (c) to halt their fur T ier advance and as soon as the military situation permits to with draw their forces from Persian territory, L.

The result is that the Government of India have a legitimate cause for protest on this occasion though it is not clear from their telegram whether they have any particular complaint against the terms that have been given to the Persians or v/hether their protest is solely on the ground that they had no opportunity to comment before the decision was taken. As regards the Shah I understand that the decision that we must continue at present to deal with him was laid down by the Prime Minister personally before the Government of India 1 s telegram No. 4623 was received. In any case a copy of their telegram was sent over immediately to Mr. Sden by the Secretary of State and there was nothing further that we could do about it. The Government of India do not perhaps realise that copies of all their telegrams on Persia are circulated at once to the Foreign Office and the War Cabinet and if decisions are taken which are contrary to the Government of Indian vievjSjthat does not mean that their views are ignored.

At the same time tee regard it as important at this stage that there should Be wide realisation of fact that the Britjsh Empire when challenged RECd.POL.DEPt. - 1 SEP *941 INDIA OFFICEr A. i 5341 19 41 challenged is sufficiently forraid&amp;ble and that Persia could scarcely expect not to ©e hurt if they made the challenge« 3* The possibility of 3ecur( ing,Omitted) an east to west line of communication to facilitate movements by land across Persia between India (?and) Iraq should not be overlooked,, 4« Before making our final recommendations we should wish to be apprised of Bullard 1 s views on the whole problem* 5. This telegram was drafted before receipt of Poreign Office telegram 5^5 to Tehran#secret 29th August 194i. prime Minister I enclose a telegram from the Viceroy which he thinks you might like to see. as a matter of fact, I think most of the points in it are already being covered. I gather the idea is that neither the Russians nor we should actually occupy Tehran. I quite agree as to the disadvantage of letting any of the Germans go, with the prospect of their finding their way back later. Indeed, I would object less to a very small number of them, who may be bona fide technicians, continuing at their work under strict surveillance. L, S.A,Secret 29th August 1941. My dear Anthony, I think you are already covering all the points in ^e enclosed telegram from the Viceroy. I would certainly not let the Hermans go if they haven’t already escaped. On the other hand, it might be possible to keep a few of the bona fide technicians carrying on their jobs under strict surveillance. I gather that we wish to avoid a joint occupation of Tehran or anything like a partition of the country except from the point of view of where our two lines of communication meet. If indeed it is necessary to use the / railway as far as KazVin we may be compelled to have an Allied railway transport office at Tehran station, and in that case I suppose the Russians will want to keep troops fairly near Tehran in case of a rising in the city and on attempt to Interfere with the traffic. All these things rather confirm me in my notion that it would be a useful thing to have a definitely Allied Government in that city. Yours ever, 4. S/h The Rt.Hon. Anthony Eden, 1C., V ?.r J Telegram from Viceroy dated 28th AUgUbt 1941. 2073-3 * .personal. Waveil has shown rae prime rlnister's telegram to him 86438 of August 26th and you may care to have rny personal comments on Persian oosltion. There are two aspects (a) tnrough communications with Kussia, (b) vital importance for defence of fi iddle •last and India of keeping Germans out of Persia. I do not oropose here to say more about (a) than that military operations must evidently be pressed far enough to-secure control and defence of essential railway system: (b) German forces in Persia would threaten .India, our essential oil supplies,- our command and use of Gulf and our whole position in the Mediterranean. I hope ivar Cabinet will decide with Russia to control the whole of Persia till the end of ^ the war. v,e are short of troops and could not immed iately occupy in strengtn, but I think we could find forces required to hold essential points aauaerodromes over what is likely to (groups omitted) reinforcing and perhaps extending our grip as more troops become available. How much better to forestall in this way German entry whether by ground or air than 'Co wait until the enemy has established himself. ' 2. What are we to do with Germans now in Persia if we catch them? ihey are trainee men, s^eak Persian, with their contact established and an intimate knowled^ of the country. I hope we ipay hold them, if we*let them out they will certaimy TlnG their way back later on if the Germans mean to strike southwards. 3. could you (4 groups omitted) quite muii, about their intentions and Kussians will no doubt claim to remain during occupation in as much as Persia as they can over run before they bump against us. ihey may well make haste to be first in fehran. May they not press for ' 1 Joint occupation of oil areas? Joint occupation isevidently a matter for negotiation with.Kuesians. Perhaps the general line ol agio-Russian Convention r of 1907 woulci be. a useful precedent, nut tnere/is important question of joint occupation xonran, and we should haveto extend tne British line under.the Convention further to.tne north ana to the.west so as to include the oil fields in it and ‘aiso to curtail or eliminate the-neutral zone (it goes witnout spying that the less public reference to.the Anglo-Rtfselan Convention the better), ue ought to ao our utiuosti to keep Perso-Afghan frontier in our own sphere• we ought I think to know our own minds on ail these * questions, perhaps prime minister. would bo interested if you care to enow him this.. . \ rHi:y dear Anthony, vm) 29th August 1941• Please see the enclosed telegram from Linlithgow. on will see that, acting presumably on his Indian &lt;pnnation, and not'on any instigation of mine, he l^ommends serious consideration of the restoration of the ^alars. remember that they are not merely a family, but a large tribe, numbering I believe hundreds of thousands, mostly in Northern Persia, ana presumably they would support a restoration anyhow. I certainly don't suggest an immediate decision-and you may have lo think over the possibility of Hussian suspicions of any restoration under our auspices - but I do strongly urge that you should at any rate have the Qajar canaluates sized up. Oliphant of course knew Prince Md. Hassan well and had a very high opinion of him, as I believe Havard had also. Loraine, who only came just at the end of his time, probably knows less of him. T only know him as a charming, courteous gentleman, quite a philosopher about his reduced circumstances, and generally pretty shrewd. As to his sons, they are quite remarkable specimens of fine, virile young Englishmen (in ail except complexion). The elder has become a British subject, is felling timber in British Columbia and, I imagine, does not want to be considered. The younger is an extraordinar ily vigorous, handsome yo.ung man, who went to sea for three years under the name of David Drummond and is longing now, to be allowed to serve in the Navy. At this moment Prince Hassan is at 'Oakwoou', Husseli Hoad, Rhyl, North Wales, telephone Khyl 390, and I believe Prince Hamid has just gone down to join him there for a few days. Otherwise he can be found at the headquarters of the Shell Company under the name of Drummond. Yours ever, JL.S.A . The fit.Hon.
