For some tine, the Air Council have had under consideration the advisahility of locating in Bahrain a detachment of No. 203 Squadron which is normally stationed at Basrah, hut which in the present emergency has heen temporarily transferred to Aden. The responsioilities of the Royal Air Force in the Persian Gulf are increasing and a detachment at Bahrain would he much more centrally situated and enable the duties of the Royal Air rorce in that area to he carried out in a more economical manner. At present the U-OO miles' flight from Basrah '.o Bahrcti^i leads to delay in the arrival of the aircraft in the event of any emergency arising along the Trucial Coast, and involves in any event considerable waste of valuable flying time. The recent Agreement concluded witn the Sheikh of Qatar renders it particularly desirable that the Royal Air Force should be in a position to visit Qatar at frequent intervals and be suitably disposed to come immediately to his assistance in an emergency. The Under-Secretary of State, Political Department, India Office, S.W.I.Before proceeding further v/ith their investigation of this question the Council 'would he grateful for an assurance that there vrauld he no political objection to the location of a detachment of the Royal Air Force in Bahrain, should it he decided that it is desirable on operational grounds to do so.

I have looked Into this matter and I am afraid there Is little hope of preparing the way privately for a later official approach In regard to exemption of customs on Royal Air Force stores. 3. K'y files show 9 and Belgrave confirms lt f that when the Navy came across here the exemption question lead to a great deal of rather Ill-tempered bickering| and In fact the Shaikh only gave way to what he regarded as force majeure. Unfortu nately he regards It as a matter of principle and I am afr Id that a fresh approach at this stage on behalf of the Hoyal Air # Force may serve only to revive rather bitter memories. 4. Purely as a personal suggestion I think the matter might well be simplified If an approach on the subject of customs ex emption were made Incidental to a definite undertaking to locate a pennanent Royal Air Force unit here. The Shaikh Is concerned at the state of world politics} and a proposal that Royal Air Force aircraft should be stationed In Bahrain within a specific period on condition that he w ould grant customs exemption on all Government scores for the operation of those aircraft might well be successful. I realise the difficulty of making such a propo sal at the present Juncture, but I gather It is Intended In due course to locate at least a flight here and I would advise delay- Ing the customs question until the main matter becomes a more Im mediate prospect. 5.

TiiC R.A• F. buildings cannot be located either to the north or south of their presenc land, since the prevailing wind here is north/ * The Honourable I»leut.-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, ^ Political Hesident j BUSHIRi. C.B.E., the Persian Gulf;- 2 - 3^ north and if the buildings were at either end of the aerodrome it would mean that either l&amp;ndings or take-offs would be across the buildings; and tnis they must try to avoid. There remains then the west side. There is not quite enough space between the present western boundary of the R.A.F. aerodrome and the Busaitin Gardens but enough could be obtained by tae following plan; take an extension of 60 yards to the east, bringing the aerodrome up to the dotted blue line on my sketch, this small addition being thrown into the aerodrome; then take roughly 170 yards the west of the aerodrome up to the red dotted line (i.e. the area marked B)j then for the balance a portion of the area marked C along the sea-shore. The only difficulty here is that it clashes with one of the sites for the proposed ne\* Hesidency, and that is the reason for the present letter. 4. Would it not be as well now lo abancon finally any idea of loccting the netv Residency at Busaitin ? I have given , various arguments in the corresponcen.ce regarding the new Residency for preferring Essex Point to Busaitin (see in parti cular my demi-official letter No. C/v23 dated tne 21st December 1937) and I think now there are two additional reasons for selecting the Essext Point finally. The first is that by doing so we aid the R.A.F. to establish their detachment in Bahrain without treading on anyone^s toes; and the seconc is more selfish but not less potent, namely that to live on the edge of a R.A.F. aerodrome will be the purest misery. I did not stress this point vex^y strongly ueiore, but having had ex perience in the last summer of the distractions caused by R.A.F. flying-boats flying close to the Agency when they were down here for exercise, I can assure you that the daily/take- off from Maharraq aerodrome, when the flight is established there, with the normal left-hand circuit practically past the suggested Residency windows, would drive the Political Resident to insanltyt dawn 5/-Jonf idential GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Department.

The Air Ministry have made a suggestion that the work of constructing the accommodation for one Flight for the R.A.F. at Muharraq Island should be carried out by either an Indian or Iraqi contractor, and I am to enquire whether any objection to this method of constructing the accommodation would be raised by the Bahrein Grovernment. 2. As an alternative to putting this work out to contract, we should carry it out by Direct Labour, and only obtain such materials as stone, sand, gravel and juss locally in Bahrein. We should, however, use local labour as far as possible, but anticipate that it would be necessary to import certain classes of skilled labour as insufficient numbers exist now in Bahrein for such a large project to be carried out expeditiously. It is considered that any contractor that we might employ to carry out this project would be in a very similar position to this Department so far as labour and materials is concerned, and in con sequence I trust that no objection will be raised to employing either an Indian or Iraqi contractor. 3. As it is hoped to commence the preparation of drawings and contract documents in the near future, an early reply is requested.

For your information the following is a brief summary of the methods used in Iraq: - 1. Goods consigned direct to the R.A.F. are admitted through the customs free of duty. 2. A monthly return of purchases from local contract ors of imported goods showing all relevant customs particulars, is made to the Collector of Customs, who after verification, refunds the amount of duty paid. 3.

I am directed to refer to your Command Accountant's memorandum No. S.10688/CA dated the 4th April 1939, on the subject of refund of customs duty on imported goods purchased from local contractors, and to say that the basis on which the request for customs exemption for the ^oyal Air Force was made to and accepted by His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain was that the Royal Air Force should be treated on the same lines as the Royal Navy. The Royal Navy (like the Political Agency itself) have never sought more than exemption on goods con signed direct to them, ^nd it was expected that the loyal Air Force would fall into line with this system. It is, in fact, not possible to extend the concession to transactions with local contractors; and the Political Agent does not understand why the Command Accountant should see any necessity for It.

D.O.No. 7^^- -5/ Dated May 18, 1939 Dear Weightman, I have today discussed the purcjise of land for the Royal Air Force at Busateen with Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa, who has just returned from the mainland. He is willing to sell his two plots, T.No.3/47 and T.No,432/57 and a portion of ToNo,433/57 which would give the R.A,F, the original area which they required• Ee wishes however to retain a passage to the sea and he asks that the plots T/124 and the land of Abdul Latif should be left to their owners. He thinks it undesirable that the R.A,F, area should extend to near the house of the late Abdul Latif Mishari, Shaikh Abdulla purchased the two smaller plots on the shore quite recently, for plot No.432/57 he paid at a rate of over 200^ more than the original rate charged by Bahrain Government to R.A,F. I have told him that we will pay him his pur chase price for all plots which he bought. Regarding the strip on the Deir side of the aerodrome, he asks that the strip should not extend to close to his house on the shore, that it should start, say, 200^feet inland from the shore thus giving his house a surround of 200X180, He also asks that the drain from his garden,T. No,359/51, which runs to the shore, should not be blocked as it is the only means he has for carrying off used water and draining his cultivation. He is not standing out in any way for financial profit but is considering the effect of the R,A,F, expansion on his property. He says that of course if the British Govern ment must have the whole area he will agree to what is wished, but he asks me to let you know his views on the matter. Yours sincerely.

After some discussion Shaikh Abdullah agreed to with draw his objections to the purchase of the additional strip of land attached to the north west corner of the land now to be acquired by the Royal Air Force. This strip measures 250 feet in a westerly direction from the north west corner of Shaikh Abdullah's garden (T.No.359/1351), and its western boundary is parallel to the western boundary of the area previously intended to be acquired. It includes practically the whole of Tapu No. 1/1347 and part of the land belonging to the heirs of Abdul Latif. 2. Shaikh Abdullah raised the question of the ditch carry ing water from his garden northwards to the sea and was inform ed that the loyal Air Force would almost certainly make a concrete channel along the same alignment in order to carry off this water. 3. Shaikh Abdullah asked that on the eastern side the new strip of land to be acquired by the Royal Air Force should start 200 feet inland from the shore. He undertook that if this were accepted no buildings would be erected on the ex cluded piece of land. The Political Agent said that he would recommend that this proposal should be accepted.■ I D .O.

The Bahrain GoveriMent is prepared to sell the whole area required by the Royal Air Force for the sum of Rs.20,000/-. The Bahrain Government will purchase all privately owned plots from their owners and will then issue a Government Title Deed for the entire area. It will take approximately five weeks to complete registration of the sale, but the Banrain Government do not anticipate any land claims in the area and therefore if this offer is accepted the Royal Air Force may commence work on the site as soon as they wish to start operations.

Subiect i- Purchase of land on Muharraq Island for the Royal Air Force. An Your Express letter No. C/17S dated the 19th May 1939 on the above subject. 2. After negotiations with the Bahrain Government and with Shaikh Abdullah bin •Isa, the owner of the greater part of the private lands involved, it has been agreed that the whole of the land required for the Royal Air Force will be sold to them for a sum of Kg. 20,000/-. The area includes a small additional area in the north-west corner which the Royal Air Force now require for a barrack building. It excludes, however, a small parcel running 200 feet Inland from the shore along the strip which the Royal Air Force wish to acquire on the eastern boundary of the present aerodrome. This is in deference to an urgent request from Shaikh Abdullah, the owner of that particular piece of land, who on his part undertakes that no building would be erected on this strip. I undertook to urge this exclusion in return for the withdrawal /- !sinnnJurfi \ S. 44. MFP~825S&amp;P—(M-1070)—14-9 34-10,000.— 2- 1 withdrawal of objections previously raised by Shaikh Abdullah to the transfer of the small additional area in the north-west corner. I understand f^om the Air Liaison Officer that it is unlikely to cause inconvenience to the Royal Air Force. 3* The Bahrain Government will themselves purchase all privately owned plots from their owners at the prices which those owners themselves originally paid f and will then issue a Government title deed for the entire area direct to the Royal Air Force. The price is within the limit set by Air Headquarters. 4. The Bahrain Government inform me that it will take approximately five weeks to complete registration of the sale, but that if the Royal Air Force wish to occupy the land and commence work they may do so at once. 5* There is one minor point to be mentioned* As shown in the plan of the western area to be acquired, a narrow ditch or drain runs through it from Shaikh Abdullah bin , Isa , s garden outside the area, leading towards the sea. This ditch is essential to prevent water-logging of the Busaitin Gardens in general (and hence mosquito breeding) it is requested that the Royal Air Force will allow it to remain, lining it if they choose with concrete. 6. In accordance with the instructions at the end of your Express letter under reference I shall now leave the Bahrain Government and the Air Liaison Offlcey, Bahrain, to conclude the purchase.

Reference para 2 of p&gt;u«c &gt; File 7/1-i contains correspondence in connection with the purchase of land by the R.A.F. on Muharraq. The question of a detachment of R.A.F. coming to Bahrain was a new idea suggested in 1936, and I take it that the land referred to was bought by H.M.Q. for the use of Imperial Airways, but that a portion was set aside for the R.A.F., since, according to their telegram at page 1 of 7/1-i, they wished to have a separate aerodrome from that of Imperial Airways. The land is the property of H.M.U., and as Imperial JjOJ- Airways no longer use it, presumably the R.A.i*, have access to the whole area. It would appear however (fj^m para 2 of your letter at p.17) that this land is insuffic ient for R.A .F, needs hence Col Clark's remark about the 2!/ ? acquisition of land. • Mvi —„Issued letter No. C/5C9 dated 3-8-38 to Council of Regency, Bahrain.

However, he has made one stipulation about the payment of local taxes (paragraph 5 of the p.u.c.), and before replying to P.R's memorandum at page 23, perhaps you might like to discuss the point with the Adviser, as suggested in para 2 of the p.u.c.

The correspondence discusses: plans to expand the existing aerodrome at Muharraq; questions over whether customs should be paid by the RAF in Bahrain, as charged by the Bahrain Government; the proximity of property owned by Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah to the site proposed for acquisition; the cost of the acquisition of land; and arrangements for the construction of the RAF base.
