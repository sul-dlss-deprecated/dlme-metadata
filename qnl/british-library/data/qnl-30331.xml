Proposals have recently been under discussion here at high level regarding development of oil supplies in Kiddle East. Plans have already been formulated in America for development of oilfields there to highest capacity and it has now become matter of urgent necessity given change in war situation to consider as complementary measure opening up more crude oil production in Iraq, Persia and Persian Gulf. Factors con cerned are gr° w i n g needs of Pacific and Indian Qceqn areas, requirements of occupied areas of Europe as these are freed , and easier movement of oil from Middle East through Mediterra nean . 2. ' Following schemes have now been approved in principle here for joint consideration at Washington in regard to the supply and priority of equipment in following order of priority; (1) Drilling of Agha Jari field in Persia and linking with Abadan Refinery which will represent additional supply of four million tons of crude oil per annum. /(2) 1 | ■(2) Laying of second pipeline from Kirkuk to Haifa with capacity of' three million tons. (3) Resumption of field development at Qatar . 3. As regards (3) P.C*L. have put forward proposal for resuming development operations. Original drilling rig no/7 stored at Karachi canpot be satisfactorily record itfoned in the absence of workshop facilities at Qatar and Company wishes to order three new drilling rigs in U.S. to enable them to run continuous two rig programme at Qatar . Sheikh will no doubt welcome proposal but he should not be inf ormed cf it at present stage. 4. Instructions have been approved for issue through Mideast and F.A.I.C. permitting relaxation where necessary of denial measures including permission to Bahrein Petroleum Company to prepare well sites to facilitate installation of drilling equipment and general preparations to minimise delay once sanction received to return wells to production.

I cannot help hoping also that tnere is now a somewhat lesser degree bf urgency for such questions, but we want, of course, to get them fully tied up and also to be sure tnat'yousr American friends are happy about the position. In the first place, I note from the penultimate paragraph on the first page of your letter that our latest programme, as dealt with in my letter of October 16th, has in the meantime been communicated by you to your Company, although probably not by telegram as we have seen no trace of such a message. On the other hand, the telegram quoted in your letter of Noveruber 9th still refers to the old basis, namely the reduction of producing wells from 55 to 18,'whereas the present figure is 12. To turn now to the last message received from your New York Office, the statement tha^t 'tie Companies must reserve right to reduce or stop reduction as judgment dictates' calls for some comment. As soon as the first stage of the denial schemes is put into operation } the whole position will rest upon force majeure and in all subsequent phases the Companies must accept, if desired under protest, any conditions which current R. Ballantyne, Esq., The Bahrein Petroleum Co., Clifford’s Inn, Fleet Street, E. C. 4# Ltd. exigencies/- 2 - may require. In actual practice, we have no doubt that there will he full co-operation between your Company ana the authorities concerned and that the latter will have reasonable regard to the best interests of the oiliiela in formulating their programme. The final decision /* such matters must however, you will agree, rest with the authorities and we cannot tnerefore accept the reservation mentioned aoove. You may think: it desirable to draw T the attention of your New York Office to our views as set out above. I am sending a copy of this letter to Peel at the India Office and Cowan at the War Office.

E.B.Wakefield Esq., His Britannic Majesty 1 s Political Agent, The Agency, Bahrain. Dear Sir, The Company has to report that the present programme of well plugging has been completed. There are 33 open wells left. This number is slightly more than the figure of 29 wells used in Major Boaden*s report (MGRE/23059 of June 6, 1942) which was based on a preliminary estimate. It is my understanding from conversations with you that the plan for denial of Bahrain oil wells, as formulated and approved by the British Army officials, consists in brief of the following stages. 1st Stage Plug all wells not required for a daily production of 20,000 barrels per day by a method consisting of placing a bridge of c ement in the casing iionediately above the perforations with the tubing suspended above this cement bridge. (This programme has been completed as noted above). 2nd Stage Junk the wells included in Stage No.l by a method by which the wells are rendered permanently useless and non-productive. Junk the remaining producing wells by a permanent method. It is my understanding from you that His Majesty’s Government has officially approved this programme. The Company would appreciate your confirmation that tills is so since Major Boaden f s report does not clearly outline the three stages of denial and demolition as set forth above.

L-^-i • Last evening I visited the Petroleum Division and discussed the Bahrein oil denial programme with Hr* Berthoud and Dr* L- e3 of the Division, llr* Singleton of Galt ex and Hr. Ball an g.me. Hr. B^l-oud expounded in some detail the evolut?„on r-nd iSWfeitions of the prograr.ie• He emphasised tna.t it would not come into operation until the C„ in G., Middle East, eonsiaerea that the situation had deteriorated sufficiently to warrant its introduction. He explained that the figure 01 12 wells had been chosen because oil experts attached to the Middle -^ast Command h&lt; cb* re orted that this number, of wells at ahrain couIj. eav.co 20,000 barrels a da^^ for six months. It might be possible to leave more wells open, though this would mean prolonging the demolition stage, which the military authorities wpuld clearly oe reluctant to do. Hr. Ballantyne said that it Y/ould be remerabered that the proposals made by the Company themselves an July for txie plnggin^ of a, number of additional v/ells would have — ef o more tnan 12 still oTjen. Ae had, however, recently received a cable from New York to' the effect that if these proposals were carried out the field might be unable to fulfil the understanding that it would go on producing up to 18,000 barrels a day. He therefore doubted whether Hew York would accept the estimate of the military authorities as to the producing capacity of 12 wells. (Dr. Lees afterwards explained that though this estimate would probably oe capable of fulfulment it would impose a strain upon the field^ Hr. Berthoud is apprehensive les£ the Company, oath their well- known predilection for supplying the refinery irom one mainland, will first urge that more wells should be plugged earlier than the programme contemplates, and then say that they cannot oe expected to produce so much oil from so few wells^. Mr* Ballantyne suggested that, subject to Jae agreement o„ the India Office, he should tell Newark, when_communicating to them the details of the programme,they wished,the India Office was willing to send them a letter to one following eixecu. ^cM-'ys, U&lt; C*r^' c t f If, as a result of the operation of the pix&gt;gramrae, the Company were left with only 12 wells open, ana ai—in—tkiwiy opinion they v/ere unable to produce 18,000 barrels a day from these tC fiffl Y/ells/wells, they would not be expected to go on producing up to this figure* . I said that the India Office had been kept fully infomed while the programme was being worked out, and that we fully concurred in it, since its intention is to enable the Company to. • go on producing at their present level right up to the demolition stage. I thought we would be prepared to send Hr. Ballantyne a letter such as he had suggested, if his Directors should so desire. Mr. Ballantyne is preparing cable to New York on the -lines suggested. It will be submitted for our concurrence before despatch. Meanwhile he agrees that -we need send no reply to his letter of September 23rd. f . I gather that the intention of the last sentence of the second paragraph of his letter is somewhat as follows 'It should be understood that when the programme is brought into operation, the Company may find itself compelled, as a matter of force majeure, to reduce production or even to cease producing altogether”•COPY SAB PS 148/15 SSCRET ■i-'ear Singleton, MINISTRY OF FUEL AND POWER * (Petroleum Department), 7 Millbank, Lon oo n, o . m M- 4 Hi 21st September, 19|42.

As in the case of other areas, three stages are involved - 1) Stand by . Plug but not junk as many wells except 12 as dura tion of period allows.

Plug and junk remaining wells. Junk wells plugged during stage 1) above. Destroy installations. As you will notefrom the foregoing, the Military Authorities have decided to cut down from 18 to 12 the number of wells to remain open until the bitter end. The remaining changes are devised to ensure the greatest efficiency and par ticularly not to prejudice the necessary production from the Bahrein field until the last possible moment.

I am pleased to inform you that the Company is prepared to bear the expense of carrying out its proposed program of well plugging for which approval was requested in our letter to you CON-993 of 31st March 1942. This program, in brief, consists of plugging wells which can be spared and still maintain a production of 20,000 barrels per day by a method consisting of placing a 100 foot plug of cement above the perfor a tions. If the Company is requested to carry the pro gram further than now proposed or to use a different method of plugging e.g. permanent junking of wells, the company may expect compensation for such work.

So far as demolition is concerned the Bahrain Petroleum Company have apparently been told that this mill if necessary be carried out by the military themselves anu they have apparently ceased to worry about the matter. I should be glad to kno,* however for my own purposes what decision is finally reached regarding the responsibility of deciding when demolition should take place, and I still think that the Bahrain Petroleum Company should be informed of the position in writing. Prior promised Lipp in Cairo that such information would be authoritatively conveyed to the Company, Would you kindly therefore let me know in due course either direct or through the Tenth Army what I may say to them on the subject. Yours sincerely, Sd. W.R. Hay.Copy of cable received through Official channels, 12th Lay, 1942. 8th llay, 1942. Following for Hamilton Ballantyne, Cliffords Inn, Fleet Street, London from Donald Hanna (Begins) ixanner of, and responsibility for, demolition of Bahrein properties, if and when necessary, of great concern to us. Refer to our letter of January 16th. Lipp, when in Cairo late March, discussed matters with Berthoud, who advised that matter confiden tial, and would be discussed only with the Manager at Bahrein. Berthoud advised Mission would visit Bahrein in April and confer with Anderson. Anderson^ cable 373 received April 30th reads 'refer Byrne’s personal memorandum to Crow dated July 24th. Bagdad authorities state they are not interested in these methods. If situation justifies action, they will send experts here to formulate plan and arrange for supply of necessary equipment to perform the work. Understand these plans wall receive prior approval of poli tical authorities. Work will not be done until 24 hours before ceparture, and will be done by them. Methods used are complete in nature. Suggest you verify these arrangements with London.” Byrne’s memorandum contains suggestions for method of demolition. Anderson appointed member of Petrol Committee Bagdad about April 21st. This Committee handles protection and demolition. Anderson’s cable 373 advises that Middle East Army Command are solely responsible for plan of demolition and execution thereof, if necessary. Suggest you dis cuss London authorities and also contact Berthoud who, we understand now in London, for details and have Anderson’s cable confirmed, ad vising us soonest.( \SicJlxxy^) . Copy of cable sent through Official channels, 18th May, 1942. IMPORTANT. Following for Donald Hanna 130 East 43rd Street from Hamilton Ballantyne. Singleton ana I have had full discussion with Petroleum Department on Bapco and Gasoc denial plans. 2. as explained to Lipp in Cairo Bagdad Petroleum Committee offshoot Cairo Committee acting in advisory administrative and other capacities concerning all oil matters connected with Hiddle East Command but with no executive capacity and within joint jurisdiction of Minister of State Cairo and kiddie East Commander. 3. So far as Bahrain is concerned the policy is to make such preparations as will ensure that nothing likely to be of use to the enemy shall fall into his hands: this involves the following operations. (i) Effectively shut off flow and pressure all wells surplus to requirements This operation now being undertaken on forty outside wells by Bapco. I understand this work is regarded as protection of Bapcos own property and the cost is there fore being borne by Bapco. (ii) If it appears to the military authorities that situation justifies carry* ing demolition operations a stage further then the surplus wells will be permanently blocked with cement and steel fillings on instructions from responsible military authority in such a way that ultimately it would probably be easier and cheaper bore new wells than unstop old ones. Such orders would be given if danger became probable although not necessarily imminent having regard to the time factor and the staff available. (iii) Remaining eighteen wells to be destroyed immediately in like manner if and when danger became actually imminent. (ivj Bapco not to be concerned with reason or necessity for orders given for denial operations. , ( v ) Expense of labour and materials supplied by or on responsibility Bapco incurred secondly and thirdly are not to be borne by Bapco who would render accounts U in due course to Petroleum Department such accounts to be subject to audit. v’ (vij Authorities here have asked that Bapco should co-operate at all times fullest possible extent in men and materials in carrying out denial. (vii) You should instruct local manager to insist upon orders for demolition being given to him in writing by the responsible local political officer or the responsible local military officer. (viii)No compensation claims could be dealt with now nor can it be said by whom such claims would ultimately be dealt with nor in what manner and for whose account they would be liquidated nor in what fashion.4. Bahrain Go-vermrient is being kept informed. 5. India Office feel no doubt that all operations discussed above would in fact constitute force majeure within meaning Article Eight Nineteen forty Deed. 6. The position of the Mainland being treated similarly from the physical aspect of denial but will depend upon arrangements to be made between the several Governments concerned. 7. I assume neither Canada nor United States directly concerned with Bahrain or Bapco. 8. Have assured Petroleum Department that everyone concerned can rely at all times upon the fullest possible co-operation and assistance from Bapco^and Casoc but Authorities concerned must appreciate that Directors primary concern is to ensure that responsibility for loss and damage sustained does not fall upon Companies. 9.

Due to present situation in the Near East I cabled Anderson June 30th ask ing him how many more wells he could secure without damage to the proposed one assuring 15,000 barrels daily production. Anderson replied July 5th telegram No.322 'Your confidential 30th present programme will be completed about 15th leaving 33 wells open. Can cement 15 more guaranteeing 15,000 daily or 22 more guaranteeing 10,000 daily. Can complete at the rate of 6 wells weekly. Doubt if Government will approve proposal since army contemplate first stage of pres ent programme and second stage permanently junk wells previously plugged and third stage permanently junk [grp. undec.: ? remaining] 33 wells. Have not agreed army proposal pending advice from you. Can permanently junk well rapidly by pumping well full of cement leav [? grp. omtd.: ?ing] tubing in place. If this method to be eventually used we should not previously plug in order to prevent interzonal migration, advise soonest.' I replied to Anderson July 9th 'Your 322 meeting held New York July 8th with Davies Skinner Sealey Ohliger con cluded following: (l) If additional wells are secured as per our cable June 30th recommend starting with edge wells complicating either 15 as maintaining 15,000 barrels production or22 in case of maintaining 10,000 barrels production but no work to be started until advised by this office. (2) We all at loss to under stand why Government hesitate to approve this programme as it is our firm opin ion that if wells secured at this time final junking all wells greatly simpli fied and speeded. We feel that 33 wells open in Bahrein are too many to quickly secure and feel military people will agree with our contention if conditions understood. In other words wells that have been plugged with cement can be junked with steel at the rate of 2 or 3 daily or faster while original plugging rate only one daily. Believe political and military people fail to understand this great advantage. After reviewing [grp. undec.: ? again] with military, advise if they agree securing additional wells. (3) You are not authorised to agree to paragraph 3 of programme until you have received written orders from proper authorities as per my telegram of July 8th. Because of geographical location of Bahrein we doubt if junking called for but if and when military authorities insist you are to obtain written orders as outlined. (4) We here are not greatly concerned on the question of intermigration. (5) Suggest plugging gas [grp. undec.: ? meantime] well No. 1 unless you feel necessary to leave open.' Present production of Bahrein 15,000 barrels daily with no immediate increase in sight.

The fact that the question had been discussed would inevitably become known through Ibn Saud's advisers and might well spread alarm and despondency. The best course in my opinion is for the plan for demolition to be perfected with aDsolute secrecy ana for Ibn Saud to bo informed only if and when the need for destruction can bo clearly seen iramodiately ahead. When Ibn Saud himself saw the immediate military necessity, he would I am confident understand and there would be no time for counsellors to advise him to start bargaining about compensation. 2c The United States Charge d 1 Affaires agrees. 3. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company are concerned about their concession, for not only nave they sunk considerable sums in equipment and operation, but the Saudi Arabian G-overnment are in their debt for about 12 million dollars, a sum which they can only recover from future royalties. They are of opinion that it would be a mistake to discuss the matter with Saudi Arabian authorities and Ibn Saud; the manager assures me that he has had no hint from them of possible demolition.

DEPt. - 9 JliL 942 INDIA OFFICEThe note flagged , A’ summarises the denial measures which are being brought into operation in the Persian Gulf oilfields. The measures to be taken at Koweit, and their effect upon the Koweit Oil Company's concession, have now been discussed by us with the Petroleum Deparimient, the War Office, and a representative of the Company. The position at Koweit is similar to that at Qatar in that a number of wells have been drilled and sealed by the Company, no oil having yet been won. At the beginning of the war it was agreed between the Company, H.M.G. , and the Sheikh, that there should be no production while the war lasted. On this basis the payments for which the Company are liable under their concession were s one what r evis ed. The C.in C.Middle East recommended in a telegram dated May fTth* that the Koweit Oil Company should suspend their drilling operations, plug all their 9 wells ; and have in readiness material for their permanent junking. This programme has been approved, but permanent junking will only take place in the last resort. Tne Political Kesident has already heard something of the measures contemplated {see his telegram ho.1249 of June 30th). It is now proposed to send him a telegram broadly on the lines of our telegram No.10901 of June 18th about Qatar, summarising the concessionary position and instructing the Political Kesident to inform the Sheikh of what has been decided. A draft for this purpose, which has been agreed with the Petroleum Department and the War Office, follows. It will be seen that no difficulty with the Sheikh need be anticipated at the present stage. The Company's representative has told us that his Board have not yet formally decided to continue their payments to the Sheikh at the present rate, but he thinks it most probable /thaty/ill do so. The drs.f't s.sks 'Lhs.’t the Poli'iCci-L Agent, should emphasise to the Sheikh that tne measuies which the Company have been instructed to take (viz* the plugging of the wells) are designed to safeguard his oilfield; and that no mention should be made to the Sheikh of the possibility that the wells will have to be junked in the last resort. ^If this were done the Company would have to drill new wells after the war and the date when they would be able to start paying royalties to the Sheikh would thus be postponed) . The second draft telegram below forwards a message from the Company to their local Manager, instructing him to comply with the orders of the appropriate authorities. Two letters from the Company to the Petroleum Department, which will be found below, raise the following subsidiary points Whether, the Company should be allowed to communicate the broad outline of the proposed measures. to.JIajor Holmes,, the Sheikh’s London renrecentative. Our knowledge of Major Holmes suggests that, though his business methods may not always be entirely satisfactory, there is no reason to suppose that he would make improper use of any information of this sort. Moreover, as the Sheikh himself is to be told about these measures, it does not seem possible to object to his London representative being told likewise. It is therefore proposed to authorise the Company to make to Major Holmes a communication similar to that which is to be made to the Sheikh; this will be timed so as to obviate any danger of the Sheikh’s receiving the news from Major Holmes before he has it from the Political Agent. Channel for issuinp; orders to the Company. The general rule^is that t ids is to be done through the ridiL S($ ttUvx. Political Agent, except where emergency makes/faS impossible, when it i|is to be done by the responsible military authorities. i (X\£oA P C -. R&amp;Al'dU*\Cy - Whether H.M.G. take full responsibility; for an; action which they order . This is a question for the War Office and the /Petroleum- 2 - Petroleum Department, -who will deal with it. Whether the C ompany should continue their water drilling operations. The actual or potential value of the i 3£fewells at Koweit is, of course, very great; and we stand to gain considerable political advantage owing to the fact that they are oeing drilled by a British Company. This point of view has been put orally to the Petroleum Department and the War Office. The latter are about to consult the C.in C.,Middle East on the question whether the potential value of these wells to an invading enemy 'would justify their being included in the plu ggry operations. Whether the Company will wish^p^ontinue their water drilling programme, or whether they will^retain in Koweit sufficient staff for this purpose, are, of course, separate though relevant questions. 7 . vil.fi..jV mXFT TEIEQRAIvl . “f- '-f- -f- From Secretary of State To political Resident in the Persian Gulf, repeated to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, Minister of State, Cairo, and Political Agent, Koweit.

He, p also asks whether 'K.M. Government will take full responsibility for any action which may be so ordered.' I will defer speaking to the India Office until 1 have heard from you, and we might arrange a joint meeting with them. I will also not reply to Kemp -until such a discussion has taken place.

Dear Berthoud, Further to my letter and to our telephone conversation of todays I should be glad if you would let me know if I can give an outli..^, but not details, of the action which is to be taken in Kuwait to Ma^or Frank Holmes* Article 6(c) of our Concession from the Shaikh of Kuwait contains the following provision:- 'The Shaikh shall have the right to appoint - from the effective date of this Agreement - a Representative in London to represent the Shaikh In all matters relating to this Agreement with the Company in its London Office and such Representative shall have full access to the production records of the Company including the agenda of the Board meetings and shall be entitled to attend the Board’s meetings at which the Shaikh’s interests are discussed* Llajor Holmes is the representative appointed under the above Article. It would be unfortunate if at some later date &gt; it were suggested that because M&amp;jor Holmes v/as not informed of present developments the Co, .pany in any way failed to comply with the spirit of Article 6(C)* Our relations with Major Holmes are very good and I do not thin!: there is any Ij^plihood of his abusing a confidence in a matter such as that novf process. Yours sincerely, (3gd.) A.T.rJltP 3, A. Berthoud, !sq., Petroleum Department, Dean Stanley Street, uillbanm, S. • i*I )ear Berthoud, 3^ am sorry that my absence from the office owin^ to ill healt . caused some delay in dealing with Bridgeman*s letter of 30th lay regarding the suspension of operations in Kuwait. With regard to the instructions to be sent to the Political Resident, we should like it to be stressed that the present decision has been made solely for military reasons and that the Company has no option but to comply with it. (The ohaikh knows that arrangements had been ade with A.I.Q.C. Iran for the supply of a limited amount of drilling equipment etc. during the current year. Bhortage of material and shipping difficulties were not, therefore, so serious a factor in our case as in those of other companies in the same region.) Our main obligation under the Concession is to drill certain footages by certain times but as we are well in hand on this obligation there is no need, I think, to mention it in the instructions to the Political Resident. V/e are of course liable to make certain payments under the Concession and ancillary documents and it is possible that the Shaikh may raise other Concessionary points. These, however, could be dealt with if and when they arise. I presume from Bridgemanfs letter that all orders concerning the plugging of wells and suspension of operations will be issued by military authorities to the Company’s General Superintendent in Kuwait, who is in charge, and that H.H. Government take full responsibility for any action which may be so ordered. It would perhajs assist locally if you would have the enclosed telegram send confidentially to the General Superinten dent.

Heap.The note flagged 'A” summarises the denial measures which are being brought into operation in the Persian Gulf oilfields. Questions relating to these measures have since arisen in regard both to Koweit and Bahrein. KOWEIT. Here the position is similar to that of Qatar , in that a number of wells have been drilled and sealed by the Company, no oil having been won At the beginning of the war it was agreed between the Company, H.M.G. and the Sheikh that there would be no production while tne war lasted. The Political Resident stated in a letter dated March 5th last (Ext.2003/42) that even if the Company were compelled to close down their work their payments to the Sheikh would continue, and that the only result locally would be the throwing out of work of about 300 Koweitis. In the same letter, however, he remarked that the cessation of operations would undoubtedly produce a bad effect politically. It is not clear from the papers enclosed with the Petroleum Department’s letter below, nor from the Political Resident’s telegram No. 1249 ox June 50th, whether it is proposed to. ttUfaws d'Xi.v, tae wells 'by method (a) or by method (b): 'bj hr but Mr# Berthoud tells me that he thinks u tooi&lt;s as 7 K«iy#\ permanent plugging is intended.

The Company should be able to invoke if necessary Article 16 of their concession, which protects them in case of failure to fulfil their obligations on account of force majeure. With regard to the specific points raised in the two letters from the Company below:- Major Holmes was connected with negotiations for various oil concessions in the Gulf in the immediate pre-war years, and our papers of that period show that he made himself very unpopular with the political authorities there. I have consulted Mr. Gibson, who says that although Holmes is an intriguer and his business methods are not always above suspicion, there is no reason to suppose that he would make improper use of any information about the proposed denial measures. Moreover, if the Sheikh himself is to be told about these measures, it does not seem possible to object to his London representative being told likev/ise. I therefore suggest that I should tell the Petroleum Department that we agree to Major Holmes being informed in broad outline, i.e., in the same sense as it is agreed to instruct the Political Resident to inform the Sheikh. Issue of Orders. This should be done, as in the case of Qatar, by the Political authorities acting on instructions from the C.-in-C., Middle East. \&amp;l Otv ^'CM0\6 Responsibility of H.M.G. Presumably this can \ be accepted, though it is really a question for the \ War Office. r&lt;; Water Drilling. I should not have thought there v/as any necessity to plug the water wells. As their value to Koweit, actually or potentially, - and their consequential political value to us - is very great, we might suggest to the Petroleum Department * /and3 and the War Office that the Company should urged not to suspend their water drilling operations. Mr. Berthoud has provisionally fixed 12 o’clock this morning for a discussion on these points. BAHREIN. Us ftUy\ayr\ ‘X vtcC *** At the same time I might mention to Mr. Berthoujd the recent correspondence Between the War Office and the C.-in-C., Middle East, about further denial measures at Bahrein in the event of an emergency. Our telegram No. 9496 (flagged at Ext.2647/42) summarisegC the stages by which denial measures in that oil field were to be carried out. It will be seen that the”permanent junking of the remaining producing wells” was relegated to stage 3. The C.-in-C., Middle East, in a telegram dated June 2nd, recommended that this should be done at the second stage; and in his note of June 19th Mr. Peel expressed alarm at this prospect, and his preference for the compromise proposal put forward by the authorities here. In replying to this proposal the C.-in-C., Middle East^ gave reasons for adhering to his original suggestion. On receiving a copy of this telegram I rang up Mr. Berthoud, and my note on that telegram gives my impression of what he said. The reply which has now been sent to the C.-in-C. is much more forthcoming than he led me to expect. In particular, it is difficult to believe, in view of the terms of paragraph (b) of our telegram No. 9496, that it was not realised that the intention was that these further measures were to be brought into operation only when the situation deteriorated. There is still time to protest if we v/ish to ,do so. Our interest is, of course, to ensure that /now. i SECRET XX Allotted to External Dept* //* L d E CYPHER OP Y a L EUR AM* Prom Political Resident in tha Persian Oulf to Secretary of State for India* • Copy.

Under the direction of the 0.-in-G. Middle East (whose area includes the Arab States of the Persian Gulf), measures are being taken in each Middle Eastern oilfield to block some of the wells and to make preparations for the rapid blocking of the others, with the object of ensuring that an invading enemy would be unable either to make use of or to destroy the resources of the field. There are two ways of blocking the ‘-A wells:- (a) Insertion of a cement for 100 ft. above the oil level; it would take three weeks to reopen a well thus treated. (b) The blocking of the whole well solid with cement; wells thus treated would not in practice be reopened, since it would be quicker and cheaper to drill new wells. At Bahrein the Bahrein Petroleum Company are blocking by method (a) 40 wells, but in such a way as not to diminish the total production of the oilfield.and consequently the royalties which they pay to the Sheikh. Blocking by method (b) will not be undertaken unless and until the military situation deteriorates. So far as Bahrein is concerned,therefore, no important question of policy of direct concern to this Office appears toarise. The question of denial measures at Koweit is still being discussed between the Petroleum Department and the representatives of the Company. At Qatar, the C.—in—G. Middle East recommended in telegram dated May 27th (flagged) that Messrs. Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd., should suspend their drilling operations, plug all their wells by method (a) and make preparations for their permanent plugging by method (b). a result,however, of discussions between the War Office, the Petroleum Department and the Company, it has been decided that.owing to the isolated position of Qatar and the difficulty of maintaining on the spot an adequate staff to ensure tne permanent destruction of the wells at short notice, all the wells should be permanently plugged forthwith. The draft telegram below, which has been prepared in consultation with the Petroleum -uepartment, sets out the relevant considerations arising from the £bmpani£s conce^ie^ku'^’ Although, as the draft explains, the Company will continue to fulfil all their financial obligations to the Sheikh, the permanent plugging of all their existing wells will oblige them to start afresh and drill new wells after the war. This in turn may well put off the date £bhe*\ the Company starts to win oil and therefore to pay the Sheikh royalties in addition to the annual payments for which it is liable throughout the Concession period. If however, as appears to be the case, the ( Var Office and Petroleum Department are convinced that this drastic measure is necessary, we are hardly in a position to object; and it would seem that we can only do what we can to forestall any trouble with the Sheikh. It is accordingly proposed to instruct the Political Resident to approach the sheikh, as in paragraph 5 the draft, and to obtain if possible his written acquiescence in the suspension of the Company , s operations. It is also proposed to inform the Petroleum Department that we concur c/Lcmjl in their draft letter to the Company (flagged). /Wc'Ut.

We have since received from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf No.T/250 of April 11th (as ante two telegrams, of which I enclose copies, which show that these measures are designed No.T/275 of April 14th. to block the wells so that enemy forces in temporary occupation of Bahrein could neither make use of nor destroy for ever the resources of the oil field. You will see that the local management and their Directors in New York are not in complete agreement as to the/programme to be adopted; /andand that the former have therefore asked that Government approval to their proposals should • he given in general terms so that they ean adopt whichever programme is finally decided with the Directors. Would you please let us know whether your Department considers that this approval may he given; we should also he glad of your comments on the proposals as a whole. We for our part would see no objection to the broad lines of the Company f s programme, when it has been agreed among themselves and approved by ***u Government, being communicated confidentially to the Sheikh. You will see that the Political Resident asks for a reply as soon as possible. Yours sincerely. &lt;S«?€5.V R.D B C Y P H E HOF T E b E G R A M From p ol i t:i cal Re s ide nt i n the Persian Gulf to Secretary of State for India« Dated Bahrain 14*00 hours?

PETROLEUM DEPARTMEI 7, Millbank, Quoting Reference: 68/5 l/l • London, S.W. 1. Your Reference: 10th April, 1942 Dear Lumby, Thank you for your letter of 8th April to Bridgeman, enclosing a copy of a letter from Ballantyne about protective measures at the oil wells in Bahrein. We were a little puzzled by the telegram from New York, as we have recently been in touch with Singleton of the Texas Oil Company, who are part controllers of, the Bahrein Petroleum Company, regarding an extensive scheme of passive defence measures in the Island, and this work at the wells appears to be a quite separate scheme of which we have heard nothing. We accordingly got into touch with Singleton, and he has discussed the position with Ballantyne; as a result, Singleton has undertaken to obtain further particulars of the protective work at the wells from New York, and I hope when we receive this that we shall be able to clear the matter up. There is, therefore, no need to bother you to approach Ballantyne again. Yours sincerely E. V. R. Lumby, Esq., India Office, WHITEnALL, S.W. 1. JSLC/^CMinute Paper.

SI 2 t / Des.r Peel, The following is a copy of a cable I have received this afternoon from New York:- 'Kave instructed field to carry out further pro tective measures on wells. Ward Anderson to advise both Political Agent and Local G-ovemmoit. Suggest you advise India Office and if details re quired advise. tT I am not quite certain that I fully understand the cable excepting that sane sort of protection is being given to the wells against enemy action. This mi^it result in the demolition of the rigs and the erection of steel and con crete covers over the well-heads. As you probably know, those Eiffel-tower looking structures which one sees pic tured at times as oil wells, are really the rigs which have been erected in the first place for drilling and are left in situ to obviate the re-erection if deeper drilling is to be embarked upon. The structure itself is not, I believe, worth very much intrinsically; it is the labour and risk oj. erection which have to be taken into account. Further more, they would, I should imagine, in the flat sandy areas, prove excellent target marks. However, if you would like to have precise details of what is being done, you have only to let me know by letter or telephone and I will cable for them. Yours sincerely, R.T.Peel Esq., C.B.E., M.C., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000207_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3949</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000207</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3949</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/209 'Oil: Protection &amp; destruction of oil installations in the Middle East.
