After Compliments, I have been honoured by the receipt of your letter No 404 datea the 2nd inst regarding making some arrangements for the stopping of the water that flows outside the pipe of tne artesian well. I have the honour to inform you that I have made tne necessary inspection on the said well ana find that tne best way to eliminate the flowing of the water is to aig a pit- around the pipe to a depth of 6 .feet ana then to fill it up with cement and stones to the surface of the ground. This will reduce the flowihg of the water . I have tried this method on certain wells which were of the same condition. This work can be done by a mason, please let me know whether you want me to do this or you will arrange for it to be done. In the latter case please let me know so that I may send some one to show the mason how to do it.
