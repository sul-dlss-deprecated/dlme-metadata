In this battle scene, armor-clad mounted warriors charge full speed ahead their adrenaline dynamically expressed through diagonally drawn bows, galloping horses, and the spiraling clouds of dust that frame them and rise up between the opposing forces. Along with the red and yellow ochre palette, the warriors' long torsos and the shallow background represent a style unique to painting in Shiraz under the lnjuids, governors of Fars province and vassals to the Ilkhanid Mongol rulers of Iran in the fourteenth century.</p><p>This folio belongs to a manuscript commissioned by Qavam al-Din Hasan, minister to the Injuid governor of Fars province, Abu lshaq (ruled 1335&ndash;1353), in <span style=\"font-size: smaller;\">A.H.</span> 741/1341 <span style=\"font-size: smaller;\">A.D.</span>, as stated in its colophon.
