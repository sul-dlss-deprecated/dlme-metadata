Customs exemption for Consular Officers in Iran. I have the honour to refer to Tehran printed letter No. 311 of 26th June 1934 with enclosure to the Foreign Office, of which a copy No. 134 was sent to you, which states that customs exemption is granted to Acting Consular Officers de carriere, who arrive from abroad, on conditions of reciprocity. 2. Customs exemption is granted 'by the x ranian Government to Consular Officers for their first nine months in Iran. 3. Lieut-Colonel G # Loch has acted as Consul-General for periods of 2-3 months during my absence in 1933, 1934 and 1935• 4. In 193o he was granted no exemption and in con sequence the negotiations leading up to the ruling in the letter under reference were started. 5. In 1934 exemption was granted to Colonel Loch, 'but orders were issued to the local customs authorities so late that the privilege proved of no value. 6. J-'his year Colonel Loch has had no occasion to make use of the privilege as he has been using the stores imported too late for consumption last year. 7. As the privilege of exemption is 'based on reci procity, I have the honour to request that I may 'be informed whether, in the case of Acting Iranian Consular officers in ■'■ndia, la) exemption is granted on each occasion that an officer takes up an acting consular appointment from abroad, or (b) the short periods of acting in consular appointment over several years-2- p are added together until the nine months are completed, or {. c} whether the first acting period, although possibly less than nine months, is the only period of exemption. Oolonel Loch 's case is unusual, as in my absence on leave he acts in the same post for a few months every year# 1 am sending a copy of this letter to His Majesty* Minister, Tehran, and to the India Office who 1 suggest might enquire from the foreign v ffice what customs privileges are accorded to acting Consular officers in Great Britain.No. 36/89.Ill f I The Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the presents his compliments to Gulf The Political Agent, E A H R A I &gt; !&gt;• o JJlK. -3 and is directed to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned documents.
