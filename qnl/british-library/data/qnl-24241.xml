VTranslation o:T a letter --o* 375 da'oed IGtli October 1^36 a.roni the He si den cy Agent Oharjah 9 to the Political Agent Bahrain. After Compliments. I beg to submit for your information as follows On Tuesday evening Oth October 1936 T’hiratdas Bamanrnal agent of the firm of Dananmal isardas bought a quantity of pearls from a young pearl merchant called A dullah bin --anad of Ajman and appointed on his behalf a young Bunnia called dokaldas Dholdas to weigh them, dokaldas Dholdas asked that the weighing should take place in his pot and Abdullah bin Hamad insisted that it should be done in his pot and on account of this difference some words exchanged between them. Ookaldas alleges that Abdullah bin Hamad told him :! you are .-afoori” (Opium SmokerJ and the former said in reply to the latter :j ycu are hhanitlv' (Sodomite). The boy got excited and gave Gokal 2 strokes with his stici: (cane) one on his head and the other on his shoulder. Gokal went to the Buler of Dubai and complained against him. Abdullah l bin Hamad was arrested at once and put to jail. Gokal neither informed me of what Y/as happened to him nor did he complained to me. But when I came to know about this I asked the Huler of Dubai to inflict a punishment on the offender as deserved by him because he transgressed on a British subject, resides this is a transgression on the authority of the local Government, dn Thursday Gth October 1936 a party of Arab merchant notables of Dubai went to Gokaldas bin Dholdas and other Bunnias and requested them to forgive Abdullah so that he may be released from the prison. Out of regard to the Arabs the Bunnias acceded to their request and forgave Abdullah bin H a mad for what he did, but they stipulated that Abdullah bin Hamad should submit an apology in writing so that he may be released. The Arabs got frightened and thought that this was a trick played on the part of the Bunnias in order to establish their case agains u the boy ano. did not ar*ree to write • They boy remainedin jail. The Haler of A.'man wrote to the Haler of uibai asking him to release the boy and refer the parties to the dhara. Hat the Haler of Dubai excused himself from doing so because the complainant was a British subject and it was impossible for him to send him to the Shara. -he Baler of Ajman wrote to me to send the parties to the Shara, but I also in my turn did not agree to do so because firstly the case v/as criminal, secondly the complainant was a Sritish subject and non-mi slim and thirdly in case of sending such cases to the ohara and a crime is committed by some British subjects in which the Shara is applicable then we shall be bound to send it to the Shara. I beg to state that some of the ^&gt;hara decisions do not suit the present time as it is impossible to apply them in these days hence 1 could accede to his request, xhe Hater ox Dubai therefore finec. him Hs.lCO/- and released him. fhere is no doubt that the Bunnia made a mistake by calling Abdullah oin Hamad a sodomite which word naturally excites every man and I believe that Gokal was the cause of all this trouble, xhe occurrence of such incidents against any of Oman people does not necessitate pressure and punishment to sucn extent. But as this was aginst one of H.B.iPs subjects others will be encouraged to commit such deeds and insult the authority of local Governors who have weak will and cannot do anything against their subjects especially those who are wealthy, if this case had been ignored and no action taken against the offender.

A.G •, I beg to state tnat my sister Asmaii bint Abdul Aziz al Wazzan went to Dubai l£ months ago to join her husband Gharib bin Mahmud. She sent me a letter complaining bitterly against the gross illtreatment of her husband who was beating her as a result of whicn she is now lying sick in bed. She requested me to go at once and save her from this oppression. As I had some doubt regarding the truth of her statement, I wrote to some friends of giine to enlighten me with tne facts. Yesterday I received a letter from one of them saying that she is in a worse condition than she has stated and that her husband confined her in a room without windows in this hot weather. He has also kept one of his sons to watch her so that she may not get in touch with any of the neighbours who may report about her condition He further stated that she has become slightly insane. As the steamer does not call this week at Dubai, I am submitting this complaint to you with the request that you may kindly save her from her present condition till I go to Dubai myself as I fear that in the meantime her insanity may increase. I am sure that you do not agree to sucn treatment. I request you also to give me a letter to the Residency Agent.No. 233-B/7. \a) 12?

On asking her about her final opinion with regard to her husband, she said that she likes him and prefers to remain with him provided that he treats her and his second wife in one and the same manner. There is no truth in her complaint that he had detained her. He has been living in his house since qp.ong time and before her arrival from Bahrain. ni s financial position does not allow him to live in a better house, l advised the husband to give good treatment to his wife as required by the Bhara' Law of Islam and that he should treat her and his second wife equally. 1 also advised the wife to behave well with her husband in the foreign country.

After compliments, I am eager to come to pay my respects to you but I could not do so as I am sick and undergoing treatment at the American Hospital. I beg to state that my brother Shaikh Maktoom bin Rashid has arrived in Bahrain with a Saudi passport and has been admitted to the Bahrain Government Hospital and is now doing well. We hope that after a few days we will be able to come to pay our respects to you. I beg to inform you that Sayid Abdul Razaq and Shaikh Sa'id bin Maktoom always intrigue against us before the doctor at Dubai and before every one else connected with the British Government with the object of doing harm to us in life and property. The Dubai doctors* report about the hopelessness of my brother Maktoom*s sickness proves this because his sickness is not so serious as reported by that doctor and Inshallah you will see him when we come to pay our respects. I pray that you and the Honourable the Political Resident may be pleased to free us from the intrigues 6f Sayid Abdul Razaq because you stand for justice, may Allah keep you as a last resort for us and every oppressed person, and may the Almighty grant victory to the High British Government, the champion of universal freedom and the spreader of justice. I request you kindly to consider my requests which have been taken note of by Abdulla Boodai. U.E .9KB Requests made by Shaikh Man*a bin Rashid to the Political Agent, Bahrain. 1. As it is possible for Shaikh Sa’id through the instigation of Sayid ASdul Razaq to send his men to the steamer and to arrest any of my relatyTes and followers, and Sayid^Abdul Razaq might later defend and justify such action, I request^jsuch action may kindly be ensured against. 2. The Residency Agent has created in the minds of the Trucial Coast Chiefs the impression that if I or any of my relatives or followers go to stay in their territory we would be the cause of harm to them. Because of this / none of the T.C. chiefs accepts any of us to live in his territory. It is therefore requested that the Residency Agent may kindly be forbidden from doing such intrigues against us. 3. As we desire to pursue our usual business of pearl trading at sea and as it is possible for Shaikh Sa^d through the instigatio* of the R.A. to send a launch with armed men to get us, we request that Shaikh Sa’id may be forbidden from fighting with us at sea. 4. Some of those who left Dubai with us and whose business is trading with Bahrain and other Gulf ports may kindly be granted travel documents. 5. Heera, where we took up residence, is not far away from Dubai, and Shaikh Sa^d is always intrigueing against our lives. Therefore it is requested that we may be granted a permit to import from Bombay two rifles with six hundred rounds of ammunition for self defence for me and for my son, Rashid. 6. It is requested that I may be granted a letter of good offices to serve as a letter of introduction for me before the Political Officer and others. . . 7. I have published(a map of the Gulf pearl fishing banks which I had printed in Bombay and which was detained by the Bombay Customs authorities pending grant of permission. It is requested that permission may be granted to me to import the same into Bahrain. 8. It is requested that Rashid bin Buti and two relatives may be granted travel documents to come from Trucial Coast and to go with me to Saudi Arabia and other places.
