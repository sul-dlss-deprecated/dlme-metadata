An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 20-302; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled. A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains papers relating to the negotiations on oil exploration and extraction agreements between the ruler of Kuwait and the British Political Agency in Kuwait. The majority of the papers discuss the controversy surrounding the competition between the Anglo Persian Oil Company and the Eastern and General Syndicate for oil contracts in the territory of Kuwait. Arabic documents are either correspondence between the Political Agent in Kuwait and the Ruler of Kuwait or translations of agreements relating to oil concessions in Kuwait.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Contract law</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eastern and General Syndicate Limited, oil company</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000f4#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000f4#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000f4#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000f4#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
