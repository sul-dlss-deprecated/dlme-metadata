( INDIA. ) MOST RESPECTED SIR, May I respectfully sub nit herewith a prospectus of the most important work called^ PRIN CE V ON BULOW MEMOIRS” which I pray to your Honour will be graciously pleased to kindly read attentively and favour me with your valued commands for the same, which will, it is asserted with confidence, prove of unrivalled importance. ♦ In the year 1920 Prince Von Bulow informed the German publisher, Ullestein through an intermadiary, that he intended to write his Memoirs, which he wished to entrust to them. An agreement was drawn up with Ullestein on January l5th, 1921 The agreement included a clause to the effect that the work s hould n ot be published until some time after the author’s death. The Prince wished with all his heart that the world should believe in the sincerity and fide- lit y of what he had written. And posthumous publication seemed to him the surest guarantee of this. The manuscript was dictated by the Prince in the year 1921-1926. He had been used to dictating all his life. As he walked up and down his study, his sentences were formed just as easily and surely as the brilliant periods that he was wont to unroll in three parliaments. But in spite of this easy dexterity, the dicta tion took him five yea rs And then followed three further years of care ful laborio us revision. He made continual corrections and emendations in his own hand. He registered these changes by means of numbers written on separate sheets, and he confirmed the autheticity of these sheets by sigiing each one with his own hands The Bismarckian school in which the young attache had grown up revealed itself tenaciously and effectively in his old age. Every date, every name, every quotation was verified repeatedly by the use of reference books. Every sentence was carefully weighed and pondered again and again. Three copies of the manuscript were made and these were preserved in the safe of a bank under a sextuple seal. When the Prince died on October 28 th 1929, they were taken from the safe, the location of which was known only to a few of the initiated, and handed to Ullestein, the publisher The work of editing and publishing began at once, superntended by the Prince’s literary executor and editor. Ministerial Director Franz von Stockhammern, whose preface was written was still alive. Thanking your Honour in advancec^tad trusting to be favoured with an early reply. I remain.

Eiis country has been re-named after him, Sa'udi Arabia; and he himself has been well styled ‘the greatest Arab since Mohammed.’ A ruler in the mould of Kemal or Mussolini, he has built up his realm on the twofold basis of his own extraordinary personality and the puritanical form of Islam known as Wahhabism — a significant and formidable combination. Mr. Kenneth Williams offers the first portrait of this great King, written with the knowledge and sense of background which fifteen years of close contact with Middle Eastern affairs have given him. The story, from the King’s exile in an obscure port, through an astonish ing series of triumphs to the capture of the Hejaz from the late King Hussein, is an exciting, important, and unfamiliar chapter in contemporary history. 290 pages Illustrated large crown 8vo. 8s. 6d. netNo ./3?r X The Political Agency, Bahrain,dated the 15th Hovember lt'b3« To Messrs Be.rtiioiomew &amp; Son Ltd., 12 l-uncan Street, Edinburgh,9. i Lear Sirs, I enclose a British Postal Order for 10.sh.

PEARL-FISHING IN PERSIAN GULF SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR SHAIKHS BRITISH PATROL OF LAWLESS SEABOARD The British Government has decided that the recent peaceful “ demonstration ” of our naval strength in the Persian Gulf is to be repeated every year with a view to main taining British prestige among the Arabs. These Arab towns on the Persian Gulf were old when Solomon was dallying with the Queen of Sheba, old when Abraham set out from Dr of the Chaldees on his journey across *the desert to the west. They have changed in nothing, except that they now have the telegraph, motor cars, and news papers, and are regularly visited by aero planes and warships. Come with me on a journey down that ancient poast, where the Arab shaikhs are our allies, where the desert joins the sea, where time has all but stood still. The Walled Town of Kuwait Six days by air from London, we drop down on the ancient walled town of Kuwait. Until the war this strange old walled town ship, with its negro slaves and its pearling fleet, could be reached only via Bombay, nearly two weeks distant. Kow you leave London on Saturday and are in KuWait-OU Thursday. Shaikh Ahmed of Kuwait, a staunch ally of the British raj, is known as an enlightened, progressive ruler. His walled township is clean and well-conducted, his palace on the sea-front is a centre of hos pitality to strangers. The bazaars are quaint and quite unspoiled. The old Maria Theresa dollar of 1780 is current, and the .303 cartridge is accepted and given in change, its present value ikL The desert trade of Kuwait was consideraiv until King Ibn Saud established “blockade” controlling the trade route-, about 100 miles to the west. The sea-borne trade is valuable. Indeed, much of Kuwait’s money comes from the sea. The boatbuilding yards are one of the most interesting features of the town. The sea front is like the Fife fishing coast. You can see going on the building of the great yellow dhow-s—for all the world, as they lie beached, like old-time Spanish galleons— which ply up and down the eastern seas. A heavy smell lies over all, for the teak wood of which they are built is seasoned and re- seasoned with fish oil until the whole place reeks of it. The Slump in Pearls Pearling, too, is a major “ industry ” of the town, and the Kuwait fleet goes yearly to the Bahrain banks. For the past four years, however, the pearling has been a failure. The world slump has hit the luxury-purchasers in America and Europe, and though good pearls are still being got, they are virtually unsaleable except at absurd prices. In this way the slump has affected even the simple-life towns on the Persian Gulf. There have always been wealthy men in Kuwait, but to-day they are neither so numerous nor so rich. Many are doing well ip the smuggling business. As Kuwait has a lower tariff than Iraq on certain commodities in general demand, a lucrative smuggling “ industry ” has grown rip in the south of Iraq, involving the Iraq Customs Department in much trouble and expense. _ The camels and motor cars go up by night into Iraq from Jahrah, in Kuwait territory, where the Royal Air Force were in action three or four years ago, and slip across the frontier. They then lie “ doggo,” plant their loads at agreed places, and return. Sometimes they are caught by the fast armed cars of the Iraqi Customs; if not, their confederates make for the spot where the goods are hidden, and, if they get them away safely, distribute them throughout the bazaars of Southern Iraq. Naturally this smuggling hits honest traders very hard and most un- famly. But the Arab is born dishonest! The Great Fishing After Kuwait comes Bahrain, whose shaik has been Britain’s ally for many years. Hie island shaikdom depends largely on the pearling industry. Bahrain is already pre paring for the great fishing; within a short time the pearling banks will present the spectacle of 150,000 naked men diving in shark-infested waters for pearls—gems that will be sold in Paris, London, and New York—that ie, if the West has any money. The great pearling fleets are now prepar ing. As im Kuwait, the big, high-pooped dhows axe drawn up for caulking and riveting; sails, spars, and masts are being repaired. About half a million men are engaged yearly in the pearl fishery. All have depend' its, and it is safe to say that the livelihood of nearly 2,000,000 people depends directly on the prices offered by Paris and New Y • merchants for the pearls. Apart from .these direct dependants, the general prosperity of the Gulf town depends very largely upon the success of the fishing; everyone hopes that 1934 will be better than the last three years, when even good pearls could not be (Sold. Each dhow carries from 24 to 35 divers. They go o-^pr the side naked, with a basket slung round their necks. The sharks nor mally do not molest them. Down they go, and wnen their breath ie exhausted they are pulled, up, with 'baskets full of pearl oysters, by the- rope-men, some 30 or 45 in number. These are the same men who null at the ca T s when diving is not in, progress. The sailing crew, who normally take no part in the fishing, number about a dozen. Profits and Prayers In all about 5000 dhows are to be seen on the banks at the height of the season. The running costs of each are from £375 to £750 per season. Most of the men, encumbered by old debts to the dhow-owners, make little or nothing out of their work; but it is a lucrative trade for those who are in it, and for the ruling shaikhs on the coast it is an important source of incqme. Each shaikh- dom sends its quota of’ ships, each fleet, under an '* admiral ” in the biggest dhow, setting sail when the season starts after a ceremony of prayers and drum-beating. These. Gulf pearl markets remind one rather of Hatton Garden in that the dealings a’-” so inconspicuous. The merchants, who look anything but wealthy, carry their (pearls in i Utile, knotted pieces of rag, which they pro duce from the voluminous folds of their flow ing garments. All transactions take place in little coffee-shops, or in secluded rooms in the thick walled Arab houses. These transac tions involve thousands of pounds. It is hoped that this year M. Rosenthal, the king of pearl-dealers, will resume his annual visits, which would be taken as an earnest of a revival in the trade. A great British bank maintains a branch, with a British manager, in Bahrain solely for the pearl trade. It is certainly unusual to find a big bank established in a small town where only a few hundred of the people are able to read or write. The fact that it pays the bank to maintain such a branch is an indi cation of the amount of money that pasees.. The Pirate Coast The next important shaikhdoms south of Bahrain are Dubai and Sharja. They are on the Pirate Coast, as it used to be called; the Trucial Coast as it is now known, from the truces concluded by Britain with each C ite chief from time to time during the century. These towns are far more fanatical than Kuwait and Bahrain, where the people are kindly. On the Pirate Coast the Arabe are stark and uncouth souls, dwell ing in misery and hedged about by the iron Muslim law. Much more civilised in Muscat, at the entrance to the Gulf, our last port of call. Muscat knew Nelson as a midshipman and other admirals before him. It knew the pearl trade and the spice trade and the slave trade, and has its own history of murders and dark crimes. But, unlike the Pirate Coast, it^ has for generations been in full commercial contact with the world, and directly in touch with India and Zanzibar. There is a great rock at Muscat on which is inscribed the name of every ship that has touched there. The bazaars sell all kinds of Western commodities; you can buy French eau de cologne there cheaper than you can in Paris or London. This, than, is the coast and these are the towns where the British Navy and the Royal Air Force flying-boats maintain a ceaseless patrol. They settle disputes, manumit slaves, and keep order on the high seas. For the Gulf otherwise is a lawless place. Thus they maintain the all-red route to India. Vagaries of Climate In winter the temperature may drop to freezing point, though normally it is pleasant like Egypt’s climate. In the summer it can soar to 120 or 125 degrees Fahrenheit in the shade—a variation which no other place in the world can match. To spend a summer at the southern end of the Gulf is like spending months in a continuous escape of steam—hot, humid, and impene trable. Summer in the Gulf is no picnic, but the work of the British sea and air patrols goes on unceasingly, maintaining •&gt;* nreltisr* .of tie fli^i tv E. JSCOTT] I ✓ - • '■ Educa Cht POLITICAL National Liberal Suggestion The Executive of the Educational Institute of Scotland will meet shortly to consider the selection of a candidate for the by-election in the Scottish Universities Parliamentary Division caused by the death of Dr D. M. ; Cowan. ' . If . the Institute favour a - candidate - unsympathetic to the National Government, the political parties, it is understood, will challenge the nomination. In the existing circumstances it is felt that a ’ contest is. almost inevitable. . . The National Liberal and Unionist Parties will hold executive meetings within the.next .few days to review^ the situation. ' 1 * u - ray, University College, Exeter, is' oeral nominee, and will be - submitted sity- Liberal Association. T BE AVOIDED? \Omiuated, and the choice of the . three \iembers is made under .the Proportional Representation system. That. procedure, of course, will bo modified in a case like the present of a by-election in which only tne one member has to be returned. If rival candidates from two or more of'the political parties compete for- the seat the’ electorate will be invited to cast ’ their votes supply for their political favourite among the : candidates. . 1 ' \ : , Under the Act of 1918, in which the Scot tish Universities were, combined in a single . constituency returning three members oi 5 Parliament—previously.the arrangement wa; 5 .that Glasgow and Aberdeen united in return mg one member and Edinburgh and Si , Andrews in electing the other of tire two which completed tire University representa tiorr of that time—the position of returninf officer was vested hr the’Vice-Chancellor o the University of Bdirrburgh, and it there lore falls in effect to Sir Thomas Hollanc to prescribe the dates for .the ensuing by election. The method of jwbing follower is that of the submission of a written vot by the graduate to the Registrar of hi University, who forwards tire communica tions after collection to the returning office in Edinburgh for the purposes of tin enumeration. THE ELECTORATE. Tire Registrar of each of the' four Uni versities sends a circular letter and voting paper to all the members of. the General Council who are resrdent at the time of the election within the-United ■ Kingdom and the Channel Islands. Tire graduates . who are abroad are not included, but there is a provision that should nny graduate not resident in the United Kingdom happen to be in the country at the time-he can claim a -vote on application to the University Registrar. The replies from the electors must be sent to the Registrars of their respective Universities for the purpose of checking the eligibility of the vote before it is' submitted to tire- returning officer for the enumeration. . The, vote has to be accom panied by the, signature of a witness as wgll as that of the graduate. &gt;. - . pile by-election has arisen at a very, in convenient time for tbe : Uhiversity authori ties, as the new register -is made up at the beginning of each year and will thus be in course of preparation at the moment. The four registers .will require a good deal of revision,, as the hew graduates of the year will have to be added, file names of those who have died .removed, and' corrections made in the case of those who have changed their addresses during the twelve months. The electorate 1 has been enlarged,«too, by the enfranchisement'of ail the women graduates at the age of 21. * The numbers of graduates oil the registers at January 1, 1933, 'were' a?' follows St Andrews, 3111; Glasgow,. 19.577;. Aberdeen, 7668; Edinburgh, 19,484—total, 50,140. . / TWO NEW METROPOLITAN MAGISTRATES BY-ELECTION AT LOWESTOFT The King has been pleased to approve a recommendation of the Homo Secretary that Sir Gervais Rentoul, K.C., H.P.,, and Mr Geoffrey Keith Rose be appointed Metro politan Folice Magistrates to $11 the vacancies caused by,the death of Mr J.

STUDENTS of Islam have long waited for someone to make available in English a comprehensive study of Shi’ite Islam. There is a good deal of detailed information available in German, particularly in the writings of Ignaz Goldziher, but English has seen no more than partial and fragmentary studies on the subject up to the present. Even Professor Browne in 1924 wrote that “we still possess no comprehensive and authoritative statement of Shi’a doctrine in any European language.” While the author of the pre sent volume modestly disclaims any such “inclusive ambition” for this effort, yet the reader will discover that he has admirably succeeded in laying the foundation for the important objective suggested by the late Professor Browne of Cambridge. Dr. Donaldson is a missionary of the American Presbyterian Mission in Meshed. The origin of the Shi’at Ah, or party of Ali, is well known to all stu dents of Islam. This party maintained “that Muhammed had definitely ‘designated’ Ali his son-in-law to be the Imam or ‘leader’ of the people.” Further, it is held by the “orthodox” Shi’ites that the Imamate is based on the “expressed intention of God, and the command of the Prophet . . . . . there have been twelve of these Imams Muhammad designated the first one, and after that each one designated his successor. The ‘ historic imamate ’ or period of Twelve Imams, lasted through two hundred and Tventy-eight years following the death of Muhammad.” mmu IS pointed out that one of the fundamental beliefs of the Shi’as the sinlessness and infallibility of the Imams. Added to this is the belief m the Imams as mediators, so that pilgrimages to their graves are undertaken with greater enthusiasm than the pilgrimage to Mecca. But the most char acteristic article of faith centres around the last of the twelve Imams. Dr Donaldson refers to this as follows: ' rne behel that the last Imam did not die, but that he disappear'd miraculously over a thousand years ago, and that he is expected to return in order to bring about the complete victory of the Muslim theocratic state throughout the world, is a doctrine that has had most important influence in Persian history. Frequently this expectation has been regarded as poli tically dangerous, and there have been periods when those who cherished the Sai ite faith were subjected to severe tests and persecutions. The hope of the return of the twelfth Imam persisted, however, and was reasserted in desperation when the lands of the Shi’ites suffered from the ravages of the Mongols, the Tartars, the Turks, and the Afghans; and when the shrines of their sainted Imams were repeatedly desecrated, and those who refused to take refuge in the doctrine of tahiyya (dissimulation) were ruthlesslv massacred.” It is further interesting to note that “in the beginning of the sixteenth century, this belief in the authority of the hidden Imam made such headway that under the Safavid dynasty Shi’ite Islam became the official religion of Persia.” The belief that “the hidden Imam is the one in ultimate author ity ” was even given “tacit recognition ” when the Persian constitution was adopted, and “as this Shi’ite clergy are his recognised representatives, this accounts for the number of clergy who were members of the Parliament during the period of the Kajar dynasty.” further it is pointed out that “this continued waiting for the Imam to reappear has given rise to heretical sects, for in addition to the various schools of Shi’ites that arose from the factions that occurred at the death of an Imam, always over the question of succession, there have been other sects, such as the Shaikhis, Babis, and Bahais, that owe their origin rather to the recurring centuries of disappointment that the hidden Imam does not return.” Dr. Donaldson devotes the first twenty-three chapters of his book to a discussion of the causes that led to the origin of the Shi’ites, and the im portant but more or less monotonous vicissitudes which attended the lives of the Imams. By far the most interesting, and in some ways the most valuable part of the book is contained in the last eight chapters. These deal with the important part the Buwaihids played in bringing about the development of Islam as the religion of Persia; Shi’ite Traditions; Shi’ite Scholars and Theologians; four chapters discuss articles of Shi’ite faith: the Imamate. Sinlessness of the Prophets and Imams; and the Prophets and Imams js^^liators. The last chapter is devoted to an account of the “ Rise of Re lated Sects in Modern Times,” notably the Babis and Bahais. The book is well furnished with a detailed Table of Contents, a Classified Bibliography, and a good Index. Besides there are six full-page illustra tions. It would have been better had more consistency been observed in the matter of spelling, for alternate spellings are found for the following: Klshhad and Meshed: Safavid and Safawid; Shi’ite and Shi’a (as an ad jective). Proof reading has been very well done, and there are only a few minor slips such as on page 231, where the word Ashari is found for Askari. Having made such a good start, it is now hoped that Dr. Donaldson will go on with his investigations, and later on give to the English-speaking world that more “comprehensive and authoritative statement of Shi’a doctrine” to which he has made reference in his Preface. In the meantime all stu dents of Islam are deeply indebted to Dr. Donaldson for the excellent con tribution to the literature on the Shi’ites which is to be found in this volume. —Murray M. Titus in “The Indian Witness,” September, 1933. “ Hitherto there has been no clear and comprehensive account of the history and beliefs of the Shi’a in the English language, but now Dr. Dwight M. Donaldson, an American Christian missionary, ‘after sixteen years’ resi dence in Mashhad ’—we quote the preface—has found it possible to study at close range the largest pilgrimage cities and therefore to undertake to de scribe them by giving an outline of their history, and by showing in a concrete way ‘the hope and faith of the thousands of Muhammadans in India, Persia, Mesopotamia, Syria and Egypt who make these long journeys for the forgive ness of their sins.’ The result comes very near being that ‘comprehensive and authoritative statement of Shi’a doctrine,’ the lack of which in any European language the late Professor E. G. Browne deplored in his Persian Literature.” “Islamic Culture,” Hyderabad, India, Vol. VII, No. 3 * * * * “It is comprehensive, and it is accurate; it is critical, but it is sym pathetic. . . . Dr. Donaldson has written the history of the Shi’ite religion : he has refrained from writing its epitaph, nor has he allowed his own convic tions anywhere to appear. He wears throughout the mantle of the historian, but it never hangs heavily on his shoulders.” “ International Review' of Missions,” October, 1933. * * * *It is, as far as we know, the most scholarly and complete work on subject in the English language, and one which no students of Islam cai* afford to neglect.” “The Near East and India,” June 15, 1933. The greater part of the book is thus historical, and here the author working over ground that is familiar and often treated in larger works, but it has this 'value that the interests of the Shi’ites are here disentangled from the wider history of Islam as a whole, and thus one is enabled to get a sharper picture of the main trend of Shi’ite history. The author, however, is at his best when he leaves history in order to give us the chapters on the Shi’ite shrines at Najaf, Kerbela, Mashhad (his own city), Samarrah, and the graves oi the Imamzadehs and local saints. Here he is drav/ing on his own experi ence and personal knowledge, and makes a real contribution. There are rela tively few students of Islam vvho have the opportunity to visit these shrines and first-hand information such as is given here as to the state of the shrines and the details taken from pilgrim handbooks on the ritual of the pilgrim ages, is extremely valuable.” “The Egyptian Gazette,” Thursday, June 22, 1933. “Dr. Donaldson has had exceptional opportunities for present-day ob servation and his studies have given him access to much historical material to w hich he refers in copious footnotes. M bile the early struggle between the ri'v al C aliphs is given in detail, perhaps the most important chapters are those giving the history of the Twelve Imams and their place in the framework of Shi’ite faith and practice. The description of the great Shrine Cities and their importance as places of pilgrimage is embellished by several fine photo- giaphs. The chapters on Shi ite tradition and the sinlessness of the prophets are especially valuable A detailed table of contents for each of the thirty- three chapters and the full index materially increase the value as a book of reference as does the classified bibliography.” “ The Missionary Review of the World,” October, 1933.

Just as every writer on the Balkans is pro-Serb, pro-Greek, pro-Bulgar, pro- Albanian, or pro-Turk, so our Arabian and Syrian authorities are often almost fana tical supporters of the Hashimite princes of the Hejaz, of Ibn Sa‘ud, their con queror, or of the Imam of Sana‘a, whose stout Yemeni hillmen even Ibn Sa‘ud has not yet ventured to tackle. These authorities generally pour scorn upon each other’s princes. Writing in 1934, Mr. Armstrong is in a position to mock his rivals; for his man is undoubtedly the man of the day. Ibn Sa‘ud now controls the whole of Arabia except the Asir-Yemen- Hadramant-Oman fringe to the south and the “ fertile crescent ” to the north. Three- fourths of the Red Sea littoral on the west are in his hands, and on the east he touches the Persian Gulf. Rule by Personality That is not to say that Mr. Armstrong has any justification for his somewhat arrogant condemnation of British Arab policy during the Great War, and espe cially of the advice given by “ Colonel T. E. Lawrence.” Still less is it to say that the Sa‘ud dynasty is even now firmly established. The King’s rule is largely a personal one; his youth is past; and his sons have not yet fully proved themselves. That his achievement has been an extra ordinary one and that he himself is the greatest personality Arabia has produced for a long time is none the less undeniable. Mr. Armstrong’s book is exciting and high-coloured—perhaps too high-coloured. One reads, not without pleasure, but always with the impression that the writer is setting himself to make phrases, to “ put the stuff across ”» for the benefit of a public whose taste has been vitiated. Yet the* story is one of epic quality, and it must be said that it is clearly and effectively presented. Thfe great struggle of Ibn Sa'ud’s life, as it was of that of his father, was against another chiral Arabian Emirate, the Rashid dynasty of Hail. All through his youth the Rashid had the better of it, and Ibn Sa‘ud grew to manhood as an exile, either with the Beduin on the fringes of the Great Desert or in the malodorous port of Koweit on the Persian Gulf. His first great feat, which set him upon the road to fortune, was the recapture in 1902 of his father’s old capital of Riyedh with the merest handful of men. His greatest politi- cal achievement was the settlement of colonies of Beduin upon the land. Under the title of “ Ikhwan ” (Brethren) they became the spearhead of his armies instead of the curse of his administration How It Was Done Until a few years ago his life had been one long struggle. Now he was backed by the Turks, now opposed to them; at one moment he saw his gains of years torn away by a single battle, the next, he was in luck again; at times he was in receipt of British subsidies, at others British aero planes bombed his' villagers. Infinite patience, boldness, personal bravery, cunning, and honesty by Arab standards have brought him to his present great position. Mr. Armstrong shows clearly that he owes his success not merely to doing but also to realising what could not Ue done.••• I V % : / ar he m :ts ie le 3d iy in hold its ground.

AT ADEN AND BASRA THE R.A. t I T is several years since the Imam of Zeid gave serious trouble to the Aden Protectorate by invading and occupying our protected territories. He and his troops were driven out by the Fairey 3F. bombers of No. 8 (Bomber) Squadron in an almost bloodless war, which so shook the prestige of the Imam that the tribes men of the protected territories took heart of grace, rose, and hustled the Imam’s troops out of their country. Since then there has been no serious trouble, but even now “ incidents ” occur at intervals. Last July a party of tribesmen from the Imam’s country made a raid on two villages near tlm foot of the Thirra Pass, some 100 miles N.E. of Aden. The villagers are stout men and they put up a lively resistance. Whilst a merry little fight was in progress, it so happened that a formation of No. 8 B.S., returning from Mukalla to Aden, flew over the scene of the fray. The Zeidi leader, muttering “ May Shaitan fly away with the R.A.F. ! How on earth did they hear about this little private tea party of mine ” ! or words to that effect, immediately ordered a retreat, while all the villagers in the neighbourhood, confirmed in their belief that the friends of the British were always sure of help (poor be nighted Asiatics!), immediately mustered in force and saw the raiders to the door. None the less, in August it was reported that 30 Zeidi troops with 400 Yemeni tribesmen had raided another part of the Protectorate and had carried off some prisoners and livestock. What is more, a British subject was pre vented from anchoring his dhow and landing on Protec torate territory. The district where this occurred was remote, and some time elapsed before a report reached the Resident at Aden. When it did, he was very properly wrathful, and sent a strong demand for full restitution to the Imam’s representative at Taiz. No notice was taken, and another small raid was made in September to collect taxes which were certainly not legally due to the Imam. Then evasive replies were sent to the Resident, coupled with promises of restitution, which were not carried out. Some prisoners were released, but the more important ones were kept as hostages, while, as a great concession, the owners of the camels, etc., were allowed to pay a ransom to get their property back. Then the Resident sent a Fairey 3F. to the official at Taiz and to the Imam, with a message which said in the most urbane Arabic, “ Any more of your lip, and I’ll let No. 8 B.S. loose at you.’’ Full restitution was then made. Suppose we had had no aeroplanes at Aden, how could we possibly have protected our subjects and feudatory tribesmen? The answer would appear to be what the dic tionary calls a syncarpous, polycarpellary fruit of the citrus medica limon. The R.A.F. Commands of Aden and Iraq are mutually interested in developing a coastal route between Basra and Aden. That part of the coast which lies between the Gulf of Oman, where the “ Atalantas ” of Imperial Airways pass on their way to India, and the Hadramaut coast just to the east of Aden, is very imperfectly explored and mapped, and when the aircraft from both sides have set out to look for suitable landing grounds, flying-boat bases and anchorages, they have found the tribesmen on the coast far from anxious to assist them. However, the air craft persisted, and the first stage of success was marked when “ Rangoon ” boats of No. 203 (F.B.) Squadron at Basra met Faireys of No. 8 B.S. at Murbat in December, 1931. Last November a further success was registered, when two “ Rangoons ” flew all the way from Basra right through to Aden, a distance of 4,000' miles. The time may come (who knows?) when it may be very important to be able to fly right round the coast from Suez to Basra via Aden. Apart from the exploration flights, which must be of intense interest, the squadrons at Basra have occasional little excitements of their own. Last July information was) received that Beduin tribes round Sharjah, which is af station near the Gulf of Oman, where passengers by Im perial Airways spend a night, were in a state of unrest 5 because the Sheikh of Sharjah had not paid them their' usual allowances, and the rumours went so far as to state, that the tribes meant to mark their displeasure by makingff an attack on the resthouse. It was at once decided toll make an air demonstration over those tribes, and No. 84 • (Bomber) Squadron at Shaibah, near Basra, fitted four 3 Wapitis ” with tanks for a long-range flight. Meanwhile I the Residency Agent at Sharjah reported that the situation I had been much exaggerated, but it was thought that none I the less it would do no harm for the “ Wapitis ” to carry fi out their programme. It would be a good practice flight if f nothing else. So the flight was made, and it took the machines 7J hours only to arrive at Sharjah non-stop from Shaibah. For the next two days they carried out demon stration flights over the tribal area, and as the situation was then normal, they flew home again. Quite a good performance!_ -«.c»a _/0 dlCcL, 17.25 sq. ft. (1,603 m. 2 ) ; tailplane area, 31.7 sq. ft. rudder are carried centralb r above them. At present an .

Such was the a m using experi- :ence of Lady B o w y er-Smyth, who has just re turned from a visit to her hus band, Commander Sir Philip Bowyer- Smyth, on the Per sian Gulf. “ The She ika was a strikingly beautiful woman in her richly coloured burnous,” Lady Bowyer- Smyth told me when I met her at a luncheon party, “ and her lovely hands were exqui sitely ‘ made up ’ for the occasion, with vivid scarlet nails and carefully henna’“'d palms. “ W drank tea and ate a bewilder ing variety of dates and sweetmeats. Then we were offered a bitter-tasting coffee—and it was not until my cup had been filled up three times by a slave that I became alive to the only polite way of refusing more—to shake my cup from side to side! ” YEOMEN in purdah are not so narrow in their outlook as many people here seem to think. It app ’ rs that the Sheika discussed European affairs far more intelligently than many women who rejoice in their “ freedom.” Lady Bowyer-Smyth flew to the East by way of Basra, a journey of just over three days.

It involves a climb to over 6000ft. to clear the mountains. I have been in a machine which has easily covered this “ hop ” non-stop on a 1000-miles range. Jask is roughly 558 miles from Bushire, leaving the Jask-Karachi “‘hop” at about 600 miles. Here are the approximate distances between checking-in points: ^ TV *Sv VV* From WILLIAM COURTENAY Our Air Correspondent Royal Aero Club has now been able to arrange an extra checking point on the London-Melbourne Air Race, which is to be flown from London on October 20. This aerodrome will be at Jask in Persia and this new arrangement which the Royal Aero Club has made with the Persian Government is of great importance. The conditions governing the race issued by the Club on behalf of the Centenary Council of Victoria provided that author ised checking places would be established along the route of the speed race approxi mately every 500 miles. The chain of control points has now been arranged and through the courtesy of the Aviation Section of the Automobile Asso ciation I am able to give the exact miles by air between the various aerodromes at which competitors must report. The longest “ hop ” was between Bagh dad and Bushire, Persian Gulf. The distance direct by air is 1035 miles. The prize money in the Handicap Race is to be awarded on a formula which will take into account the total elapsed time of each ’ Milos I Alor Star 536 Singapore 405 Batavia 572 Rambang 725 Koepang 5C6 Darwin (Aust.) ... 518 Newcastle Waters 370 Cloncurry 525 Charleville 535 Narromine 430 Melbourne 435 Approx, mileage 12,453 to be covered by Miles London Marseilles 602 Rome 388 Athens 658 Aleppo 762 Baghdad 456 Bushire 493 Jask 558 Karachi 600 Jodhpur 380 Allahabad 548 Calcutta 466 Rangoon 630 Bangkok 300 The total miles entrants in the handicap race is greater than in the speed race. The former pilots will be flying in giant “ hops ” by great circle courses. As regards the cost of competing, a pilot machine from the time of leaving London | a single-engmed light airplane to arrival at Melbourne. | cruising at about 100 m.p.h. will find that From this will be deducted the time' j cos ^ ^ . n e n ^ ro ^ throughout _ the route c pent at the authorised checking places I avera § es 10d. per gaJon. * from the moment pilots report to the offi cial until the moment the latter signs them off. The handicap allowance time will also be deducted at Melbourne before winners are known. LONG RANGE Whereas in the past long distance flyers have been enabled to overload their machines for record-breaking flights in order to take sufficient petrol and oil for very long range, such wflll not be the case in this race. ^ Every machine must carry a Certificate of Airworthiness, and will only be allowed to carry a load within its category. This will limit range in the case of the average light airplane cruising at about 100 m.p.h. to about 1000 miles. Such types on previous long-distance flights have been loaded with enough fuel for 2000 miles or more. When Mr. J. A. Mollison flew the North Atlantic in 1932, for instance, from Ireland in a Puss Moth, his range was raised to 3400 miles and he carried a load in a three- seater machine equivalent to the weight of nine men. The only compulsory stops in the London- Melbourne air race, both for those taking part in the speed and the handicap contests, are: London— Bagdad Allahabad Singapore ... Darwin Charleville .. Melbourne .., Total .. This is by Great Circle Course. BETTER CHANCE Obviously the machines in the Handicap Race will give their best perfomance on the formula if pilots stop as little as pos sible. Hence range will play an important part. Competitors who are entering light air planes where the range to keep within the Certificate of Airworthiness regulations will not exceed about 1000 miles will now have a much better chance through the facility of the extra checking point at Jask which the Royal Aero Club has arranged. Without this it would have been neces sary to land at Jask or elsewhere in the Persian Gulf at an unauthorised aerodrome m order to refuel. The time spent in this way would be counted against the pilot as flying time and would materially retard his chances in the Handicap Contest. It will be seen from the figures given below that the longest “hop” in this con test is now from Athens to Aleppo. This is a flight of 762 miles over the lower Cicilian Mountains. By making it non-stop a halt in Turkey is avoided. So far no official checking-in stations have been arranged in Turkey, and, in view of the rumoured tightening of regulations concerning the flight of foreign civil air craft over Turkish territory, competitors will be well advised to give Turkey a wide berth. However, assuming every competitor has a minimum range of 1000 miles, even this NO HEAD WINDS Assuming approximately 12,000 miles are covered at 100 m.p.h., and that about six gallons are consumed per hour, the flight would take 120 hours and would consume 720 gallons of petrol. This takes no head winds or tail winds into account. They may on the average cancel each other out or may raise or lower consumption. The cost of 720 gallons would be £102. To this should be added the cost of oil at 9s. per gallon. About 5 per cent, of oil to petrol is the average consumption. Oil would thus cost only about £16, as about 36 gallons only would be used. This brings the fuel costs to approxi mately £118. To this must be added costs of passport, visas, maps and entry fee. The sum of £50 would cover these items. The entry fee of £10 for the Handicap Race is returnable if the competitor starts, and provided he does not take more than 16 days to reach Bagdad. DEPOSIT OF £20 The Air Ministry generally requires % deposit of £20 to cover costs of cabling various countries for permits to fly over or land in their territories. But if about two months’ notice is given it can be done by correspondence, and only a £5 deposit is required. Much of this is then returned. Assuming, therefore, that the competitor already has his machine with special tanks for a minimum range of 1000 miles, the total cost of flying to Australia in the Han dicap Race would be about £150 to £200. A similar sum, of course, would have to be allowed for the return flight. All competitors in both races are allowed 16 days in which to reach Essendon Aero- drome, Melbourne, and all who fulfil the conditions of the race and arrive within 16 days will receive the Gold Medallion. In order to achieve this the pilot of the light airplane cruising at only 100 miles per hour would only have to fly abou &gt;eight hours a day. Most of this could he done within hours of daylight, and night flying could be confined to the take-off, so as to make landfall in daylight. Competitors speeding up this programme ought to reach Melbourne in about 12 days, assuming they do not meet with excep tionally bad weather or prolonged adverse winds. The “speed merchants,” of course, cruis ing''at perhaps 200 m.p.h. and with a range of 2000 to 3000 miles, are expected to cover the course in about four days, and even some of those in the Handicap Race will have cruising speeds of 140 m.p.h. and range of 1500 miles or more. Those in the Speed Race are also enter ing for the Handicap Race, as should they fail to be placed for either of the three prize awards in the former contest they can still be judged on their performance for the Handicap .prizes. The Royal Aero Club is allowing com petitors an extra month in which to submit details of their machines, but all entries as to type of machine to be used have to be lodged with the club by noon on June 1.Tuesday, May 15, He Was i And Wa SOMETHING, had upset E&lt; body could see that. He made his way glooi^ Lambeth dock. He shook hia beard sadly at Mr. McKenna, the magis trate. He leaned heavily on his thick walking-stick. He grunted with disapproval of the world. Had he been drunk? Yes, he had. They turned up his record. Now, the curiou hing about Edward was that he had not oeen convicted for drunkenness for two years until three days ago. Then, in the last three days, he had been convicted twice. “That is a bit quick, isn't is?” said Mr. McKenna. “ It is a bit quick.” agreed Edward surlily. Last Thursday ... I had a bath. “ Too quick. A few days in prison’ll do me good, make me well again.” “ Are you ill? ” asked Mr. McKenna. “ What is the matter with you? ” ^ ^ Now that is a question that no man can resist. To ask a man about his ailments is a sure opening for a long conversation. Even taciturn Edward was obviously moved, and at last he rid himself of his surliness, and told the magistrate all about it. “ Last Thursday,” he said impressively, “ I had a bath.” He paused to enjoy the effect of this announcement. “Yes,” he reflected, “last Thursday it was. I went down to the Lambeth baths, and I had a bath.” He shook his head sadly. That bath was a mistake. He had not been the same man since. That bath had upset him, and caused these two lapses which landed him so quickly in the dock. “ Gave me a chill,” he said briefly. “Too much washing, eh?” chuckled Mr. McKenna. “Mind you,” said Edward suddenly, “I won’t go to the workhouse. I’d sooner go * well, I’d sooner go to the seaside.” After all, you do not have to bathe at the seaside. “You want to go to the seaside, do you? ” commented the magistrate. “ Well, I don’t want to; but I’d sooner go there than the workhouse. What’d do me most good, though, is a few days in prison.” “Five shillings,” decided Mr. McKenna. “Five days?” suggested Edward hope fully. Clive Brook, Film Star, tm Holiday in England HOLLYWOOD, Tuesday. Mr. Clive Brook, the English film star, is coming back to England directly his present Hollywood film, “ Sour Grapes,” is finished. He will be accompanied by his wife and their two children. Clive Brook has only had one short holiday in England during the past ten years; now he is looking forward to a long rest. He will return with his wife to Hollywood in December, but the children will be left at a private school in Switzerland.— Reuter. VOYAGE TO PALESTINE BY HOME-MADE BOAT PRAGUE, Tuesday.

And he wagged his beard contentedly, picked up his stick, and hobbled off to do his five days. But by to-night, Edward will be a dis illusioned man. An awful lot of bathing goes on in these modern prisons. * # # # Charles is a headstrong lad. When Charles is crossed, things are liable to be said, and there is even quite a good chance that something will get broken. Charles was asking his mother for a little extra pocket-money Perhaps he asked toe abruptly, or perhaps his mother was a bit short this week. Anyway, she refused him the money. “I warn you,” said Charles, “that if you don’t give it to me, it will cost you more in the end.” Charles’s mother was adamant, “Very well,” said Charles. And with that, he smashed a couple of windows. Charles’s mother, however, was a woman of character, and not to be intimidated by these gangster-like methods. She soon put a stop to Charles’s little racket. He was toe big a boy to whip, so she called in the police. A very penitent Charles faced Mr. McKenna the next morning. What had he to say for himself? “Well,” said Charles, “I can repair the windows myself.” “ But why did you break them? ” asked Mr. McKenna. “ Lost my head, sir,” confessed Charles. “ If you threaten your mother again, you will get into real trouble,” the magistrate warned him. “This time you will pay a fine of one shilling and five shillings costs for the windows. And I shall bind you over for twelve months.” DUDLEY BARKER.MAY 9, 1934 769 The Aeroplane ABOUT THE MacROBERTSON TROPHY COURSE R EADERS of the newspapers probably know by now that Mr. Bernard Rubin and Mr. Kenneth Waller have flown back from Australia in record time in a Leopard Moth Gipsy Major. They did not intend to do so, and they are rather apologetic about it, because their real interest is the Mac- Robertson Trophy Race. But they did such good time in the first two days that they decided to hurry the rest of the way and try for the record. They left Darwin on April 23 and arrived in England on May 1. And the time between start and finish was 8 days 12 hours. Mr. Mollison’s time for the journey in 1931 was 8 days 22 hours. The Rubin-Waller flight was not officially timed, but plenty of evidence exists for the time of departure and the time of arrival. They crossed the Channel in fog and reached the English coast at Pevensey at 18.15 hours, because they wanted to make sure of their position. Thence they flew to Lympne where they landed at 18.50 hours. Mr. Rubin left England in March to study the course for the MacRobertson Race. His family have large sheep stations in Queensland and other Australian interests, so that his taking part in the race is particularly apposite. With the exception of Mr. C. W. S. Scott and Mr. Mollison, he and his co-pilot, Mr. Waller, will probably be the only competitors who will have flown over the course and have actual knowledge of the conditions and know the aerodromes by sight. Naturally Mr. Rubin is not going to give away to possible competitors knowledge which he has acquired, but, in a talk on the subject the other day, we found his views on the course and the contest very interesting. That question of knowing the aerodromes by sight is of first-class importance. If you are flying a machine doing over 200 m.p.h., as will be done by the D.H. Comet which Mr. Rubin and Mr. Waller will be flying, one has no time to sit around and look at the green fields. If one does not know the landmarks well on either side of the course nearing even a big city, one finds oneself over-shooting the place and saying, “ That’s Baghdad, that was,” and losing at least a few precious minutes getting round and back again— which may mean all the difference between pocketing £ 10,000 or not. Accurate course-keeping is vital and the pilot of a speed machine who loses five minutes at each of the six compulsory stops may easily lose the race by 29 minutes instead of winning it by a minute. In our talk something was said about the danger of the race. Mr. Rubin’s view is that it is really no more dangerous than motor-racing. If your engine seizes up or flies to pieces in a car when you are within a few inches of the top of the banking at Brooklands or careering along the open road, you may go over the top in the one instance or into a telegraph pole in the other. There are no telegraph poles in the Timor Sea, but there are sharks, and a competitor may unhappily be caught by one in spite of the Naval sloops, pearling boats and other marine craft which the Australian Government pro poses to string out across that 400-mile channel. Also a competitor who has the misfortune to land in the tall timber along the Charleville-Melbourne stage, or who has to come down among the trees in the Dutch East Indies may be just as dead as if he had gone over the banking at Brook- lands into the jungle behind it. On the whole, the danger seems to be just about as great as that of high-speed motor racing, but not much greater. From the competitors’ point of view the founder of Mel bourne, or at any rate he who fixed on the date for the Centenary Celebrations, is highly to be commended, because the date just happens, by pure joss, to coincide with the best weather all along the course. The weather at the start is the most doubtful factor. We may have fogs or any sort of bad weather in October, or a patch of Indian Summer. But when jp^gAnce the competitors are well past the latitude of Istanbul they are pretty sure of good weather the rest of the way. Mr. Rubin says that Baghdad West is a good aerodrome at any time, and in October there is not likely to be either rain or sandstorms. In India the monsoon generally ends towards the end of September. Allahabad aerodrome is pretty good anyway, and even Dum Dum (Calcutta), which should only interest the competitors in the Handicap Race, will prob ably be dry by then. The weather down through the Nether lands East Indies should be at about its best. The rains in Queensland, or such parts as get any, ought to be over, and Melbourne should be rejoicing in its best Spring weather. The official landing places for the speed race are all big enough for the fastest possible aeroplanes, except Darwin, which at present only gives a 500-yard run. But the people there told Mr. Rubin that they are doing their best to level out some of the rough stuff outside the present aerodrome to give a run of 1,000 yards—which may be needed by some of the fast machines when loaded up for the Charleville stage. The courses which the various competitors will fly are likely to be interesting. The Grand Circle course from Eflgland to Baghdad passes over Central Europe, South Russia, a coiner of the Caspian Sea and the Eastern end of Turkey—much of it distinctly inhospitable territory. But there is a chance that the Russian and Turkish Governments,- who are keenly in terested in Aviation, may become hospitable for the occasion. Some years ago when we in this country were interested in the long distance record, General Baranoff, since deceased, offered to light up all the stations along the Trans-Siberian railway if our record-breakers chose to take that route. And conceivably a somewhat similar sporting offer may be made for this race. But the probability is that most com petitors will make for the South of France, and cut across the North Mediterranean and along the South Coast of Asia Minor to Syria. From Baghdad the direct course to Allahabad runs across the middle of Persia which, as was shown by Col. Burchall’s lecture on the Imperial Airways Routes, includes some hundreds of miles of desert, a couple of mountain ranges up to 10,000 ft., and a few hundred miles of swampy jungle, un expectedly in Eastern Persia. Probably, therefore, most competitors will at any rate stick to the coast of the Persian Gulf. And here again we hope that the Persian Government will be sportsmen about permits not only to land in Persia but to get out of the country. From the South of the Persian Gulf or from Karachi to Allahabad is fairly plain sailing, except that in crossing the Sind Desert, if one cuts a little too far North, one may lose the railway, which is the only landmark, and so pass by Allah abad—which, by Allah, would be bad. After that the aerodromes are good and the people are all full out to do everything they can to make the race a success. The sad thing is that our very good friends in the Netherlands East Indies will be unable to take an active part in the Speed Race, unless some of the speed machines are forced to land on the East Indian aerodromes. If they do, they may be assured of everything being done for them by those excellent sportsmen the Dutch pilots and aerodrome people. Our own fear is that competitors in the speed race may be but few in number. The first prize is big, but it is not likely to do much more than cover expenses for the winner, and the lack of good second and third prizes will keep out all except those who have 'the support of Governments or wealthy backers. THE GLOBE-TROTTERS. —Mr. Kenneth Waller (left) and Mr. Bernard Rubin, on their return to Lympne.The Aeroplane 770 May 9, 1934 WITH THE O.U.A.S. Once upon a time the social gatherings of the University Air Squadrons were comparatively simple and homely affairs. Now their annual dinners come near to being State Banquets, so do the top tables glitter with orders and decorations, and so do makers of history gaze benignly on those below the salt. All that is lacking is the presence of Royalty. The Oxford University Air Squadron at its dinner on May 7 presented almost a complete Air Council, and the University itself was represented by its highest lights. Wing-Commander K. R. Park, M.C., D.F.C. (Chief In structor), proposing “The Guests,’’ referred to the air experi ence of the Secretary of State, who in six weeks had travelled 16,000 miles by air and visited seven countries. Lord London derry had passed for his “ A ” licence and owned his private aeroplane, so he must have mastered the mysteries of aileron drag—that question which seemed to puzzle so many members of the Squadron. The Vice-Chancellor, the Rev. F. J. Lys, M.A., was the first Chancellor of the University to fly, he had led the Squadron from Heyford to Abingdon when they moved a year ago. Also among the guests were two members of the Air Council besides the Secretary of State, namely, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir E. L. Ellington, whose generous treatment the Squadron appreciated greatly, and Air Vice-Marshal F. W. Bowhill, Air Member for Personnel, who as Director of Training had formerly been the official godfather of the Squadron and might now be called its great godfather. Air Marshal Sir Robert Brooke- Popham, Commanding-in-Chief, Air Defence of Great Britain, was also with us. Another guest was Sir John Siddeley, who worthily represented the British Aircraft Industry. He had more extensive interests in the Aircraft Trade than any other man. And the Armstrong Whitworth Tutor which was now used by the Squadron was cer tainly more docile and easier to control than the academic kind. The Squadron was also honoured by the presence of distinguished members of the University,—Heads, Deans, Tutors and Dons of Colleges. From the R.A.F. Central Area Headquarters at Abingdon they had Air Commodore Nicholl, and Wing Cdr. Robarts. From the Air Ministry came Group Capt. Tedder, who, when he commanded at Eastchurch, had helped the Squadron so much -when in camp. Now as Director of Training he had become the official godfather to the Squadron The Cambridge Squadron was represented by Wing Cdr. Barring ton, lately appointed Instructor. Referring to the Squadron itself, Wing Commander Park expressed the debt of gratitude he felt to his predecessors. Wing Cdr. Hill and Wing Cdr. Garrod. He expressed his pleasure at the number of past members who were present. Among them he indicated Lord George Douglas-Hamilton, who had recently taken over command of No. 603 City of Edinburgh (Bomber) Squadron, and Mr. Rawnsley had flown from Australia to England in his own aeroplane, apparently because it could not be sold in Australia. That night 90 out of 95 active members of the Squadron were present. He, Wing Cdr. Park, wished to express their thanks to Sq. Ldr. Dalzell, and the Instructors, and the Airmen at Abingdon for all they did for the Squadron, and he also expressed their thanks to their own small permanent staff at the Manor Road Headquarters. He referred particularly to Mr. Aust, who was engaged as a storekeeper, but acted as transport-driver, corre spondence-clerk, and in the evening, immaculately clad, as wine- waiter. Lord Londonderry’s Speech. The Marquess of Londonderry, Secretary of State for Air, responding, said that all the guests of the Squadron- hoped to receive the same hospitality next year. Speaking of his coadjutors and fellow-guests from the Air Ministry, he assured us that they did all the work and wrote his speeches for him and produced his answers in the House of Lords, but that in the privacy of his room they were most outspoken in their criticism. He referred amiably to the fact that the Editor of The Aeroplane, one of his most severe critics, was also' present, and he rather wondered why some of those who attacked him srill more virulently had not been invited, so that he might be duly denounced for our lack of Air Power. He regretted that he himself was one of those savages who had never been to a University. But, he said, he had consulted his late father-in-law, Mr. Chaplin, about what Oxford was like in his day, some sixty years ago. Mr. Chaplin had told him that of course, when he came to the University he had to hunt and that the Dean of his College had, after a period, reminded him that he would shortly have to take his degree. Whereupon Mr. Chaplin had told the Dean that if only he had been duly warned he might have taken the necessary steps, but that now he was too late. So Mr. Chaplin departed for the United States without a degree. Lord Londonderry congratulated the Squadron on possessing eminently that quality which could only be expressed by “ the tiresome word airmindedness.” That the development of the air had coincided with the outbreak of war ( 1914 - 18 ) was a misfortune, for the country felt that air transport was synonymous with destruction. He advised us to consider its benevolent objects. All nations should use air travel to their mutual advantage. He found himself between Scylla and Charybdis, or, in more modem language, between the Devil and the deep sea. On the one hand was his pride in the Air Force, and on the other hand was his interest in Civil Aviation. Every self-respecting country must rely on air power for its security. People said that air forces must be abolished and bomb ing must be stopped. From the beginning of history every country, when pressed by enemies, resorted to whatever weapon was best for its security. We in this country desired peace and were determined to ensue it. The Oxford University Squadron had the Service spirit, although its mem leers flew for enjoyment. And this was a most difficult country n which to develop aviation, because the distances were short and other conveyances good. Thereafter, he told us that he had that morning opened an air post exhibition and had been asked to launch a carrier pigeon with a message to the Postmaster-General. The estimable bird first perched on his head and then lay down at his feet, but when flicked by its owner consented to take off. The distance from the launching place in Vincent Square to its pigeon-cote and thence to the General Post Office was considerably greater than the distance from Vincent Square to the G.P.O., and after he returned to the Air Ministry he waited for a considerable time for an answer from the P.M.G. Just before he was starting for Oxford one of his staff announced to him that the adjectival pigeon had still not arrived. Oxford’s Orator. The Dean of Worcester College, Colonel C. H. Wilkinson, M.C., M.A., proposed “ The Squadron ” in a speech which was a pure literary joy to his hearers. Unhappily it has to be condensed. He refexed to himself as a civilian amid these pseudo-military surroundings. People drank some toasts with enthusiasm because the poor things who were being toasted needed all the help they could get,—Governments, for example. But the University Squad ron contained the pick of all those undergraduates who wanted to fly and Wing Cdr. Park would certainly wangle something for the Squadron out of somebody in authority that evening. The Squadron had always been healthy, but healthy brats were often a trouble to their nurses, and often wore them out. Wing Cdr. Gamd, for example, went to the wars in ‘Iraq for peace, after commanding the Squadron. Wing Cdr. Roderick Hill sought solace in Art, of which he had left examples at their headquarters. Flight Lieut. Barlow, their last Adjutant, powerful in will and speech, had also departed. He reminded the Dean of the saying of Menander, that not even the power of God could make a polite military man. Their late Adjutant had now gone to India to travel on strange vehicles, and he believed that no man would better become an elephant. Referring to the importance of the Air Squadron, the Dean said that when the Officers Training Corps moved to its new headquarters by the CLerwel! it marched through the streets guarding a little handcart in which were its records. But when the Air Squadron moved from Upper Heyford to Abingdon a Secretary of State flew fiom the South-East to meet it, and a Marshal of the Royal Air Force flew from the South-West. From the North flew the Squadron itself headed by the Vice-Chancellor, piloted by the Chief Instructor, like Dr. Faustus piloted by Mephistopheles. This seemed to be the only occasion on which anybody had been accused of low flying over Oxford. This proximity to the ground seemed to influence the Squadron, for quite lately at a race meeting which had been held by one of the few clubs which was still unsuppressed in Oxford there had been a race for the Air Squadron. Eight horses started and eight horses passed the post, but to only two of them did riders still adhere. Thereafter the Dean referred to the unsuitability of flying as military training in that it offered no opportunities for old soldiering. No doubt sixty years on present members of the Squadron would boast to their bored grandchildren that they had done the State some service. He coupled with the tcast the name of Mr. Heath- coat-Amery, who, whether in an aeroplane or on a horse, seemed to land either in comparative safety in impossible circumstances. Mr. E. G. Heathcoat-Amery, of Christ Church, said that he enjoyed the process of exaggerated praise to which the Squadron and he himself had been subjected. It made them feel as if they were being put up for auction. On behalf of the Squadron he acknowledged the unstinted sup port which they had received from the Air Ministry and from the University. As a speaker he felt like a motorcar tail-light after thr®^ constellatioLs which had appeared before him. * He referred to an assistant-secretary, unpaid, to a Parliamentary Under-Secretary to a certain Minister who had promised to come and speak at Oxford, but at the last moment telegraphed that the state of the country prevented him from attending. The Squadron was honoured that the state of the country allowed so many eminent personages to come to this dinner. Becoming serious, he said that the University Squadrons enjoyed unique prhileges. Privileges themselves implied responsibility. And he stated emphatically that all who served in the University Squadrons were ■ ready- to—serve the State in any emergency. This statement was greeted with sudden and loud cheers, which indicated that Young Oxford has the right idea, in spite of its parti-coloured foreign population and its yellow-infected or red-tinted British-born. Continuing, Mr. Heathcoat-Amery remarked that many members of the Squadron joined non-regular units of the Air Force after leaving the University, and he suggested that still more shouldPOST CARD RARE BOOKS We have a Special Research Department in London and can usually quote very reason able prices for old Indian and other books that are “Out of Print” and unobtainable new.

Twentyeight of these new books, by reputed authors, on important subjects of everybody reference, have been published only this year, 1933—1934. Last year, owing to the budget cuts, your new books indents were comparatively small, hence the majority of these new books could not have been added to your Court Library so far. May we therefore request the favour of your checking your library now with the enclosed list and indenting on us for some of these up-to-date important law books out of the grant at your disposal for the current financial year ? Being the only firm in India dealing exclusively in Law Books, we have a better claim on your patronage than any other general bookselling firm, and being publishers of 70% of the law books that are daily used in Courts, we can certainly guarantee supply of law books on decidedly better terms, and with the utmost expedition. Four important new books we have announced in page 8 of the list— these we promise to supply within January at the latest. For as many copies as you are likely to require of these new 1935 editions, it will be better if you place your advance orders with us now, so that we can supply these to your office immediately on publication— within January 1935.

Eastern’s Newest Books The Great White Book in Indian Law THE RT. HON. SIR D. F. MULLA’S CIVIL PROCEDURE (Amended) CODE “Sir Mulla’s Masterpiece” 10th (Enlarged) Ed. 1934 This TENTH Edition has a particular importance to the legal world as it is the LAST Edition of the Code which the illustrious Privy Councillor was spared to revise and re-write himself. For all time this TENTH Edition will stand pre-eminent, a monument to the great author’s legal acumen and juristic eminence. The extent of the revision and re-writing ejected by the author in this edition can well be imagined from the one fact, viz., that 2,000 (TWO THOUSAND) NEW CASES HAVE BEEN ADDED, and this has been done not in a ponderous Addenda ^ but a// into the text, which has necessitated a complete re-writing of at least one-third of the book. The High Court Rules have been brought minutely up-to-date, and this inimitable commentary is now also the most dependable repertory of case-law, with no misleading references. It is not a conglomeration of case-laws mechanically gathered from old and new digests by twenty individuals but the only scholarly Commentary, minutely up-to-date, and though still issued in one compact volume it contains much more relevant matter than all the other editions put together. 10th Enlarged Ed.
