Political Agent, Kuwait, To The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf, Bus hire. Sir, I have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter No . 4183 dated 17th April 1930 which I have received from S H .S. the High Commissioner's office Baghdad, and which speaks for itself. As I do not quite know how to answer it, I an, writing to ask if you could kindly give me instructions in the matter, E, It has, I understand, been the practice here in the past to serve summonses and other documents such as judgement notices etc emanating from the 'Iraq Courts, and received through the office of H.E. the High Commis sioner on individuals residing in Kuwait (whether 'Iraq subjects, or Kuwaitis having property in 'Iraq). . Sueh documents according to their nature have either been served by this office or through the Shaikh, 3. During my time here two such documents only were served, the second of them, being on a relative of the Ruler residing in Zubair who was on a visit to Kuwait t . and Es 5/- was remitted to me in each case. 4. While not wishing in any way to appear discourteou to 'Iraq, my point in referring the matter is to obtain a ruling, as to whether 'Iraq has any actual right to ask this office to serve such documents, seeing that Kuwait for all intents and purposes is an Independant i -. « ■ State,'. 'A 5. While the Shaikh has not raised the question in anyway, I happen to know that he did not like my passing on the summon ses to his relative recently. I 'squared'matters however by saying it was only kindness to let his relative know, lest an adverse decision be given against him by the 'Iraq Courts in his absence. lies in the fact that many Kuwaitis own property in and round about Basrah, while similarly several of the leading families of Basrah own houses in Kuwait and like to 'summer' here. the question and the fact that the 'Iraq Nationalist party I appears bent on slowly but sur&amp;ly working for the gradual incorporation of Kuwait into 'Iraq, or at least bringing Kuwait under 'Iraq's influence, by, on the other hand. skilful propaganda against Bin Saud which takes the form of showing 'Iraq up in the light of the obvious and natural friend of Kuwait whose interests are bound together, and on the other hand by more , 'machiavellian ,, methods such as at times flattering the Shaikh and his subjects and giving them advantages in Basrah, and at other times bringing official pressure to bear, such as the threat against the Shaikh's Fao property, which latter according to well informed Kuwait opinion merely means, 'If you acknowledge 'Iraq as suzerain your property will be safe and you need never pay taxes, if you don't, then you property will be taxed, and eventually will probably be taken from you'. The propagandists and wire-pullers are, as far as one can see, partly 'Iraqis residing in Kuwait who act on instructions from Baghdad friends and partly 'Iraq officials \ ' • in Basrah who have ways and means of bringing influence to bear on Kuwait subjects who have mercantile and landed interests in Basrah, 6 The difficulty of course.and it is a real one 7 Behind everything also is the political aspect of I have the honour to be.

Dear Agency, 1 \ We iiave received an enquiry from the 'Iraq Ministry of Justice as to whether a service fee of Rs 5/- is payable in respect of 'Iraq judicial documents served in Kuwait. The practice in the past has never / A been uniform. Sometimes a fee for service is sent to us by the Ministry which we forward to you; sometimes it is not and you have kindly arranged service in Kuwait witnout fee notwithstanding. Could you let us know whether in future you would like a fee of Rs 5/- sent to you in all cases to cover charges which may be incurred in connection with the service? Yours ever, SECRETARIAT. To THE POLITICAL AGENCY J WAIT.Mo. £16-^ c f 1930. British Keeidency and ConBulate-Oeneral, Bu&amp;hlre, the 5tii nay 1950. Sir, 5 I am directed to solicit a reference to your Secretariat letter no. 4185 of x7th April 1950 to tii© Political Agent at Kuwait, regarding service of Iraq ~ judicial documents in Kuwait. The Political Agent at Kuwait has referred the matter for the orders of the Honourable the jrolitical ■Resident and has enquired whether the Iraq authorities have any right to ask him to serve such documents in Kuwait which is an independent iitate, and has mentioned that the ShaiKh of Kuwait does not like such documents being served in his territory. As far as the Honourable the roiitical neaj-dent is aware there is no legal authority for the service of suraiaonses find other docuuents issued by the Iraq couUts in Kuwait territory. the practice seems to imve come into vogue during the war and to iiave been mintained ever since although no authority for it existed. In view of the fact however that the question has now been definitely raised Iraq authorities and V that the Shaikh is opposed to it, the Honoui'able the . , Political The Secretary to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq. SftGHUAD.-vfG No ■- s-^rr Secretariat of H.E. the High Commissioner for 'Iraq.

Accordingly, no question of the effectiwiess in Kuwait of the former classes of judicial documents can arise. These are not meant to be effective in Kuwait but in 'Iraq. 3 As regards the services of such documents on Kuwait subjects', if the Shaikh is opposed to it, His Excellency has no observations to make except to state that such an attitude is bound to have an adverse effect on the interests of the Shaikh's subjects who are parti'-s to civil proceedings in tne 'Iraq Courts, as it will mean that such proceeding ■ .ili oe carried on without the cognizance of the Kuwaiti defendant who will have no opportunity of a nt v '] v 'i o* The Secretary to i-xi-^Hon'ble the Political Resident m uh-.- Persian Gulf, Bushire„entering an appearance or defence. 4. With regard to 'Iraqi subjects however His Excellency can hardly 'believe that the Shaikh % of Kuwait could persist in a refusal to allow service of documents, nor is it clear to His Excellency why the Political Agent should be reluctant to facilitate service, which is a function performed by His Majesty 1 r is sJ is- Consular Officers the world over in places where there is.no direct 'Iraqi representative. His Excellency further feels sure that, should the 'Iraq Government f 'be addressed as envisaged in your letter under • &gt; discussion, it would strengthen their desire to appoint an 'Iraqi Consular representative in Kuwait. In His Excellency's opinion it would be difficult to resist such a demand if the 'Iraq Government in a position to show that the Political Agent, Kuwait, was not prepared to carry out on behalf of the 'Iraq Government the usual functions of an 'Iraqi Consular Officer. ■ • 1 would add that it is recognised that i. - i J Ox- uical Agent, Kuwait, is under no obligation to serve such documents himself. The object of tnis Secretariat letter ljo.4183^dated the 17th April, 1^50, was not indeed to introduce any modification of the normal procedure, but merely to make clear that the 'Iraq Government were prepared, if so desired, to forward- a fee in every case to cover the expenses of service incurred by the employment of a process server or solicitor. ' J . In view of the above observations. His Excellencyas — tJ — His Excellency hopes that the Political Resident may be able to see his way to reconsider this * matter and to give Instructions to the Political Agent, Kuwait, that the procedure at present in operation shall be continued. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Legal Secretary to H.E. the High Commissioner for 'Iraq. D .H.^23.

Sir, I am directed by His Excellency the Acting High Commissioner to acknowledge the receipt of your confi dential letter Ho.556-S dated the 9th July, 1930, regard- irJv the service of 'Iraq judicial documents in Kuwait. 2, It is regretted that the terras of this Secretariat letter Ho.5358 dated the 24th May, 1930, should have laid themselves open to misunderstanding. It was intended in paragraph 4 of that communication to emphasize that in many places British Consular Officers are in fact facili tating the service of 'Iraq judicial documents, and in t this connection, I enclose a list of countries in which service has been, and is beings effected through their | agency from time to tiineIt is true that in the c&amp;se of some of the States which appear in this li^t, tions exist between them and Great Britain regulating (inter alia) the sei'vice of summonses, but except in the case of Persia, no agreement oi any kind exists between them and the 'Iraq Government. 3. Whilst His Excellency remains somewhat doubtful as to The Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSriBEas to the necessity of a convention between 'Iraq and Kuwait to regulate the service of summonses addressed to their own nationals only, he can see no objection to the suggestion made 'by the Hon'ble the Political Resident ' in the concluding paragraph of your letter under reference. It is assumed that, on a basis of reciprocity, the Shaikh of Kuwait would be willing to undertake service not only of summonses and other judicial documents addressed to 'Iraq nationals but those directed to his own subjects as well. On the part of the 'Iraq judicial authorities His Excellency has no reason to suppose that difficulties would be raised. These authorities are not unmindful of the courtesy extended to them by the Political Agent in the past, and it is believed that the 'Iraq Government would be quite willing to confirm the existing practice by a formal arrangement if the Shaikh of Kuwait so desires.

It is interesting to note that the original sale of this Fadaghiyeh Estate to Shaikh Mubarak, formed the subject of voluminous correspondence between this Agency, the Residency and the Government of India in Sir Percy Cox's time, all of which should be on record at BusMre. incidentally Shaikh Mubarak was supposed to be-2- be making the purchase with British gold, and to counter the so called intrigue, the 'Turks tried to insist that Mubarak should register his name as a Turkish subject on the deeds of purchase.

His Excellency, with whom I have fully dis cussed the conditions in question, is anxious that the ^raq Government should realize flm the commencement that while he agrees to the reciprocal service of documents, there must be mutual respect for ths Courts of either country and their decisions. He has, he says, had instances in the past of ^raq failing to recognize Kuwait's rights in this respect, especially one glaring one in 1928, when the 'Iraq Courts in Basrah took up a case between two Kuwait subjects, which had I been settled in Kuwait.and he is anxious to make it impossible li( r s I n impossible for this to happen in future. Hence Ms condition (b). The matter is really one of common law and is dealt wilh in sections 11 and 12 of our Code of Civil Procedure. But as the Shaikh explained to me, he desired to look ahead to the days when 'Iraq, is granted her independence, 4. The reasons given in paragraph 2 above apply ' ' , v V also to condition (c) which I gather also follows normal legal practice, vide section 16 of the Civil Procedure Code. r » 1 B&amp;l The Shaikh however pointed out that the clause was to pre- triable vent one or both parties to a case obviously or tried in Kuwait, from attempting to get their suit heard in 'Iraq on the plea that they could not get justice in Kuwait, In this connection it should not be forgotton that there are always a certain number of 'Iraqis in Kuwait domiciled or otherwise, also Kuwaities in Basrah. 5. His Excellency attaches considerable importance &lt; s to condition (d). His point is that the settlement of tribal questions by tribal law, has always been understood and practiced in Nejd and Kuwait, but was quite contrary to all Turkish ideas of dealing with the tribes. When the British occupied 'Iraq, they immediately reversed the Turkish methods I and adopted the practice in vogue in Nejd and Kuwait as far as the Bedouins were concerned; this British practice still holds good. The Shaikh does not however feel at all con- fident that the present Arab Government in 'Iraq will con tinue to follow British methods in dealing with Desert Tribes \ after 1932. In fact he thinks the exect reverse will be the case. Hence his paragraph (d). 6, After examining the Shaikhls views from all angles, I think His Excellency is justified in making the condition^he has, though some may read in them unnecessary suspicion. In any case, he feels happy now that he has placed them on record. 7, It may not be amis$here to add that His Ex cellency is already deeply suspicious of 'Iraq, and is I I ♦ 1 IP fear^ convinced in his own mind that he will live to see the intke day when for all practical purposes 'the old Turkish. Regime' will once more function in ^raq, tliough under a new name. In other words His Excellency would appear to be convinced that the clock is 'going to be put back' as soon as ^raq. gets her independence# He is especially, I fear, firm in his belief that her officials who nearly all have been brought up under the Turkish system, will be unable to change their mentality or methods where Kuwait, which many of them still think should rightly belong to ' Iraq., is concerned. The present unfortunate activities of the - \ 'Iraq. Government over the question of the Kuwait estates on the Shatt al-Arab are especially to be regretted, as they have added to the Shaikh* s suspicions. The Shaikh only remarked yesterday that 'History appeared to be about to repeat itself, as the present attack on his Shatt al-Arab property reminded him * exactly of the days when the Turkish authorities in Basrah started their campaign of intrigue and strife, which dark- i ■ ^ -V v : . Ill '|P||y i| ened Ihe closing days of Mubarak and hastened his end, I naturally never cease from counselling patience, and putting forward the other side of the picture, such as the fact that there will always be a High Commissioner in Baghdad, that it is lucky that the garden question has come up now and not after and that His Majesty's Govern ment is not accustomed to let her allies down especially her small ones, but the rather pessimistic Shaikh is none too easy a subject to convince.

I did this in the first palce verlmlly, as I anticipated the Shaikh would raise certain objections. \ 3 # His Excellency expressed satisfaction that the Iraq.

He hinted that he would rather have no 'agreement' at all with Iraq, than \ countenance the suggestion that the High Commissioner t s office oe left out as the medium through which communications, whether % » judicial or otherwise should pass. 8* As I have had occasion to remark before, the Shaikh \ is distrustful of Iraq and I think not unreasonably so, if we may judge from past events. In the present case I gathered that, he S leu^ sees in the move an attempt to -feve direct dealings with himself, a course he has always objected to, where his foreigh relations are concerned. r » 9. I myself cannot but sympathize with the Shaikh's attitude, and suggest that the Iraq Governments proposal be tactfully ' turned down' if for no other reason than that Communication coming through the High Commissioner's office will always tend to emphasize Kuwait's independence. It is possibly knowledge of this fact that is at the bottom of the Iraq CovernmeniS suggestion. m I have the honour to be.

Vhile the Shaikh's apprehensions may appear somewhat •xag^erated / recent actions on the part of the 'Iraq authorities Tis -a -vis Kuwait have done much to strengthen and Justify them# 4, In the circumstances the Hon'ble the Political Resident trusts that it will be possible to arrange for all judicial documents to be forwarded as hitherto through the High Commissioner# 5. The Shaikh also asks for a copy to be sent him of the 'Iraq Government's letter recording their agreement to judicial documents emanating from Kuwait courts being served in 'Iraq and, if His Excellency sees no objection, the Political Resident would be glad if this request could be granted.

The file relates to the custom of serving summonses and other legal documents emanating from the Iraq courts on individuals residing in Kuwait (whether Iraqi subjects or Kuwaitis having property in Iraq). The papers are mainly in the form of correspondence between the Political Agent, Kuwait [Lieutenant Colonel Harold Richard Patrick Dickson], who reports the views of the Sheikh of Kuwait [Sheikh Ahmad al-Jabir Al Sabah], the Secretariat of the High Commissioner for Iraq, which reports the views of the Government of Iraq, and the office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The file also includes discussion of a request by the Sheikh of Kuwait for the creation of a reciprocal arrangement for the service of judicial documents between the two states, and the issue of the charging by Kuwait of a fee of five rupees for the service of such documents. Dickson states in a letter, which raises the whole issue, to the Political Resident dated 25 April 1930 that the 'Iraq Nationalist party appears bent on slowly but surely working for the gradual incorporation of Kuwait into Iraq, or at least bringing Kuwait under Iraq's influence'. Includes two letters in Arabic from the Sheikh of Kuwait.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretariat of the High Commissioner, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>James Orton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Francis Warden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Būshehr</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Legal documents</topic></subject><subject><topic>Legislation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00011a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
