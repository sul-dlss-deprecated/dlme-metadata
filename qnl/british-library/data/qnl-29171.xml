Secretary of State for India, No. c/29 of 1939, and to enquire if any reply has yet been received in relation to the confirmation of your opinion expressed therein. 2. It has been suggested that it was possibly overlooked in the first instance that this was a Boyal Air Porce consign ment, and that The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company were charged the taxes as ordinary traders importing goods for resale. 3. I should be glad if you would inform me whether you can help to secure the refund of the tax imposed in May 1938, and as regards paragraph 7 of your letter, if identical ar rangements are expected to apply to H.M.

There can be little doubt that Municipal Tax was levied in error on the consignment of R.A.F. fuel delivered in Muscat in or about May 193 8. At that time tne Civil Air Agreement was in force under the provisions of which fuel and stores for the R.A.F. were exempt from customs duty. As Municipal Tax was only to be levied on f, each package which is liable to customs duty’ 1 it was no doubt due to some oversight that that tax was imposed upon the consignment in question. 3. I would however suggest that it would be impolitic to demand a refund from the Muscat Government for the f&amp;Lowing reasons (a) Customs duty not being leviable on R.A.F stores and fuel under the provisions of Article 5(4)(c) of the Treaty. *# V. © 2. of 1939, municipal tax is also not IsviaDle thereon under the wording of the Muscat Government Notification introducing this form of taxation. There is however nothing to prevent the-Sultan should he feel aggrieved on being presented with a demand for a refund, from altering the wording of the Notification to embrace even articles not liable to customs duty, which would involve the R.A. Ih in heavy expenditure in the future. (b).buch demand would in all probability draw the Sultan’s attention to the fact that customs duty, to which he was fully entitled, was not levied on imports for the R . A. R • during the period between the expiry of the Civil Air Agreement on the 24tn October 1938 and the ratification of the New Treaty on the lOtfr February 1939. jbq Figures are not available in this Office but it is not improbable that a demand by the oultan, which could not be contested, for customs duty on imports during this interim pe ri od, would be highe r tha n the re f und now claimed. 4. In the circumstances, I would suggest that the claim be droppec and should you so desire it the Sultan can be approached with a view specifically to exempting for the future from the municipal tax all fuel and stores for the R.A»F sr His Majesty’s Ships. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, (Sd.) H.D.RUSHTON Secretary to the Folitical Resident in the Persian Gulf. (in absence of political Resident on tour) “COPYAP.Z. 1107/39.

Gp.685 LETTBR. 14 KPR1959 / Would you please refer to your express letter of the 11th February 1939, No.C/29, about the exemption of R.A.F. fuel from the Muscat municipal tax ? We can find nothing on record here to show what the position was before 1934, though R.A.F. planes had certainly visited Muscat for three or four years before that date, but it is clear that from the 25th October 1934 to the 24th October 1938,while the Civil Air Agreement was in force, R.A.F. fuel was explicitly exempted from customs duty under Article 15. It would appear unlikely, however, that this somewhat incidental reference to the exemption of R.A.F. fuel in the Civil $ir Agreement can have been the only basis for immunity from customs duty, and one would judge from the fact that the Sultan did not apparently impose customs duty on R.A.F.fuel from the date of the expiry of the Civil Air Agreement that he regarded his verbal promise of exemption, reported in para.3 of your express letter of the 2nd September 1934, No.842 S, as holding good quite independently of the Civil Air Agreement. In any case the interval/interval between the expiry of the Civil Air Agreement and the coming into force of the new treaty from the 11th February 1939 is a matter of a few months only and from that date the Sultan is debarred under Art. 5 (4) (c) from imposing customs duties on r.A.F. fuel. 2. It appears therefore that it is the case that at any rate from October 1934 R.A.F. fuel has always been exempted from customs duty and though it is true that there is no treaty or other provision which would enable objection to be taken in principle to the levy of municipal taxes on R.A.F. stores, the fact that the present tax is levied 'on each package which is liable to customs duty' would appear to afford adequate justification for objecting to the imposition of the tax on R.A.F.stores. There would seem to be little risk that as a result of raising objection to the municipal tax on this ground the Sultan would seek to impose customs duties on R.A.F. fuel etc. for the period before 1934 or for the few months between October 1938 and February 1939 for which, as stated above^we have only the Sultan’s verbal promise to rely upon. If you see no objection would you please ask the Political Agent to take the matter up with the Sultan accordingly.r&gt; f\ri4 L, Cm i»AIR oi ^IR MINISTRY, ing Charles Street, Tel. No. Abbey 3411.

With reference to Air Officer Commanding's letter Ho.11009/ Air.O., of the 29th August 1938, a copy of which I enclose. 2, I have discussed the matter with the Political Agent, Muscat, and the position is as follows. Under theold Treaty no Municipal tax could be imposed on British subjects. The Sultan however wished to start a Municipality for the improvement, sanitary and otherwise, of Muscat and Muttrah. It was impossible for him to do this unless he could tax British subjects, of whom there are a considerable number at Muscat, as well as his own. In order to enablethe Sultan to carry out his purpose His Majesty's Government sanctioned a King's Regulation authorising the imposition of Municipal taxes on British subjects provided these taxes were approved of by me as Political Resident. 3° As an initial and only tax the Muscat Goverrjnent proposed imposing a tax of one^ nna on every package liable to customs duty / import ed 2(1 FEB 1939 INDIA OFF1C1 S. 44.

Further, up to date the Muscat customs authorities have not levied any duty on Royal Air Force fuel* In these c ire instances, therefore, I am of the opinion that Royal Air Force fuel is not liable to Customs duty up to the date of the expiry of the Civil Air Agreement,i*e* 24th October 1938* If this view is correct the Royal Air Force, up to that date, are not liable to the Munici pal tax which applies only to goods liable to Customs duty* I would be grateful if this opinion could be confirmed or other wise* 5. Frcm the expiry of the Muscat Civil Air Agreement up to the 10th February 1939, the fuel in question would appear to be liable to customs duty* The only argument against this view would be that, in point of fact, the Customs authorities have not levied any customs dues* As however this period is only some three months, it would be difficult to argue exemption from Customs duty on this ground. 6* By the new Treaty which cones into force on the 11th February 1939, an entirely new situation is created. The Sultan from that date can impose any taxes, Municipal or other wise, on any British subject or property, provided there is no discrimination* The King*s Regulation alluded to above becomes a dead letter. ^circumstances, I am of the opinion that the best course to pursue would be for the Royal Air Force as from / the3 the 24th October 1938 to pay the Municipal tax through their agents the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company from whom it has been demanded by the Muscat authorities* It is not certain that J the Sultan will continue the present form of municipal taxa- tion, but as it is a simple means of collecting the necessary | funds, I think that it is probable that he will do s o. It is 1 S*JL /W', also not certain that he will charge Cub toms duties on e \ ft** lu+ty &gt; Royal Air Force fuel, but here again it is quite possible that he will# Perhaps he is slightly less likely to do this if the Municipal tax is paid, since any argument which we might produce for the non-payment of the Municipal tax, would merely draw attention to the fact that Customs duties had not been levied on the Royal Air Force fuel up to now* sd* T.C.Fowle* Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

Z. 2072/35 of the 29th March about the draft Muscat Municipal Regulations. Our views on the three points raised in your letter in regard to the amended version of the draft Regulations are as follows;- (1) We are prepared to leave to you the decision whether Muscat or Bushire should he mentioned as the place of issue of the Regulations. We believe that the political Resident already signs numerous public documents, e.g. appeal decisions, at Bushire, and although these may not be quite so conspicious as the Regulations now in contemplation, the difference is one of degree and not of principle, in viev/ of the general Persian dislike of the presence of the Political/ G. E. Crombie, EsqPolitical Resident on Persian soil, they are certain to find an excuse somewhere if they want m to bring the question to a head; but unless they had already decided to make trouble they would probably take no notice of the signature of the Regulations at Bushire. This means that there is a slight risk of these Regulations being the occasion (though probably not the cause) of trouble, but if you are prepared to take it, we have no objection on our part. (2) We entirely agree with your suggestion for substituting ’’the Political Agent at Muscat” for ’’the Political Resident” at the end of Article 2 of the Regulations. (3) we agree with your view that the provisions of Part V of the Order in Council must be held to apply in the case of proceedings taken under the Municipal Regulations against the persons specified in Article 8 (ii) of the Order. The King’s Regulations are made under the authority of the Order/Order in Council, and they can only be made in respect of persons to whom the Order itself applies. Proceedings against the class of persons defined in Article 8 (ii) of the Order must clearly be against those persons as so defined, i.e. with the proviso attached at the end of the sub-Article. Although Part V of the Order would probably automatically apply to such proceeding 0 , even if no specific reference to the proviso were made in The King’s Regulations, vie think it would be better to make the matter quite clear by amending the draft in the sense you suggest. T fe should be grateful to learn your decision oc in regard to point (1) (i.e. ’’Bushire” ’’Muscat’ 1 ). When this has been settled we will go ahead with the arrangements for ’'allowing' the draft Regulations, as amended by the suggestions in your letter of the 29th March.

Subject to the three following suggestions we see no objection to the amendments made by the Foreign Office in the draft Regulations:- (1) The Regulations will presumably be signed by the Resident at Bushire. j,We therefore suggest that 'Bushire” might be substituted for M Muscat M before the date at the end of the preamble to the Regulations. (2) Since the persons to whom the rules and taxes are to be applied under the new Regulations are resident at Muscat, we suggest/that the Regulations might be exhibited at the office of the Political Agent and that 'the Politicel Agent at Muscat” might therefore be substituted for “the Political Resident” the second time the phrase occurs in the last sentence of Article 2. (3) The Regulations are to apply to the persons referred to in Article 8(1),(2), (3) of the Muscat Order in Council, 1915. On the other hand under Article 8(2) of the Order in Council the Order only applies to the persons referred to in that sub-Article (i.e. Musca.t subjects registered in the Political Agency as being/being in the regular service of British subjects) with the proviso that all cases wherein such Muscat subjects are concerned shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Part V of the Order. Under Part V of the Order mixed cases between persons not subject to the Order (Muscat subjects, etc.) and persons c*Xt-fy subject to the Order can^/be referred by the Political Agent to the Muscat Courts for decision. We presume that there is no objection to the application of the proviso in Article 8(2) of the Order in Council to proceedings under the new Regulations, but we should be glad to^ know what the Foreign Office think on this po-iftt. If the proviso is to apply to proceedings under the Regulations, this might be made clear by redrafting the second sentence of Article 4 of tne Regulations as follows: 'Subject to the proviso contained in Article 8(2) of the Muscat Order in Council, 1915, the Court may make such orders as may be necessary for such enforcement and may in addition Your® tlnoerely, (Sd.) a.

Z. 800/35 of the 15th March to us regarding the Muscat Municipal Regulations, 1935, I send you herewith a revised draft of those regulations containing certain amendments which have been suggested by Beckett and certain formal additions which have been made by Miss Bigby to bring the draft into the correct form for printing. 2. Beckett's amendments, I think, for the most part explain themselves; the following comments may however be of use to you:- Article _ 2 . There will clearly have to be some means by which the approval of the Political Agent to the rules and taxes is publicly signified, since this approval has the effect of making them binding on persons within his jurisdiction. Secondly, the/ G. E. Crombie, Esq.the expression 'to whom the Muscat Order in Council 'applies' is not one which is defined in that Order (see Article 8 ), Beckett thinks that it would he right to include in that expression the persons referred to in Article 8 (1), (2) and (3) of the Order in Council, hut no others. Article 4 appears to need some addition of the kind suggested hy Beckett in order to complete it. If the India Office concur in these amendments, we will take the necessary steps in regard to the allowing of the Regulations.COPY (E 822/822/SI) The following Regulations, made by His Britannic Majesty's Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and allowed by one of His Majesty’s Principal Secretaries of State, are published for general information.

' fT- ^ Sir, I am directed to forward a copy of letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No.2488 of 1934, dated the 7th November 1934, together with a copy of the draft King’s Regulations to be called 'The Muscat Municipal Regulations,1935 w , and to say that the Government of India recommend that they be allowed. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, for Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.No.2488 of 1934. British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, the 7th November,1934. From -The Hon’ble Lieutenant Colonel T.C.Fowle,C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To - The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi. Sir, I have the honour to state that with a view to improving the sanitation of the towns of Muscat and Mattrah which are at present in a very insanitary condition*, His Highness the Sultan of Muscat wishes to form a Municipality to undertake this very necessary duty. When 1 was last in Muscat His Highness represented to me firstly, that under Article 13 of the Muscat Commercial V(- Treaty of 1891 he possessed no jurisdiction to compel British residents, of whom there are a large number at Muscat - practically all British Indian, to conform to such local Municipal rules which may be framed, and secondly, that except under a general agreement of the nature described in Article 19 of the same Treaty he could not recover from British residents the taxes required to be imposed for the financing of the Municipality and that in these circumstances he could scarcely tax his own subjects. 2. His Highness referred to the King’s Regulation of 1911 (see paragraph 3 below). I explained tactfully that it had never been put into force, and that it was in ray opinion unsuitable. 3. Under King’s Regulation No.2 of 1911, framed under the Muscat Order in Council, 1867, British subjects and British protected persons residing at Muscat and Mattrah are requiredrequired to conform to the rules issued by the Muscat Government to its own subjects for the proper conservancy and sanitation of the towns. This Regulation, however, is, I consider unsuitable in that (a) it is too loosely worded and does not provide for the prior approval of the Political Resident to any measures which may be applied by the Muscat Government, a precaution which I consider essential and (b) it does not provide for the payment of municipal taxes by British subjects, who in my opinion, should not escape such taxation. 4. The question has been discussed between the Political Agent and myself and I enclose herewith a draft King’s Regulation which has been drawn up as a result of our discussions. The following notes are in explanation of the various Articles. Article 1 repeals the defective Regulation of 1911, Artic le 2 . This, while permitting the application of local rules and taxes to British subjects, enables the Political Resident, who would normally act through the Political Agent, to prevent the application of any oojectionable measures to British subjects. ■Articl e This is necessary since the houses of owners, absent in India, may be in a condition dangerous to the public and may need demolition. If they are insanitary the tenants can be proceeded against under Article 2, but if in a dangerous condition powers must be given to the Political Agent to deal with the property itself.&amp;rkLsl£-4. The provision of a specific punishment follows the precedent of the Order in Council, e.g. Article 27. 4. I would be glad if the draft King’s Regulation could be examined to see if it adequately covers the objects for which it is intended. I have, etc., Sd.T.C.Fowle, Lieut.-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.4 . ILx&amp;JLi- MUSQ.il.
