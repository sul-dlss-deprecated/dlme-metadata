Born in Sofia. For a period Governor of Kirkuk. (2) Was an active member of the Young Turk Party and is believed to have served a term of imprisonment for certain political intrigues in Turkey. (3) During the war he was engaged in espionage as the following particulars will show. (4) In 1913 Sami Bey as a naval officer, together with Ahmad Najib another naval officer (who was on the Goben during the war and was appointed to take over one of the Turkish cruisers being constructed in England in 1914) proceeded to England and became attached to the British Fleet for instruction. While on this special duty Sami Bey and Ahmad Najib contrived to secure some of our naval secrets. Their scheme was, however, M. S-46-C. G. S.discovered and they were recalled to Turkey as the result of a complaint by His Majesty’s Government. Instead of returning to Turkey both men fled to America. (5) On the outbreak of war Sami Bey acting on instructions from Turkey proceeded to Tripoli (African coast) and there conducted espionage directed against the British and French. At Tripoli he was in touch with Turkish or German submarines and arranged for the landing of arms to be used against the Italians. He seems to have moved freely along the African coast. At Tunis he was arrested on suspicion by the French but effected his escape by drugging his guard, a French officer. (6) Being a perfect Arab scholar he found no difficulty in passing himself off as an Arab and after his escape . from Tunis he proceeded to Yemen where he endeavour ed to collect Arabs to attack British communica tions in Egypt. In this he was not entirely unsuccess ful as he appears to have taken part in several attacks on British communications and against Fiesul’s army. In one of the operations he was wounded in the head. (7) During the latter stages of the war he was in Nejef—still posing as an Arab—and there conducted awri-British and emri-French propaganda. (8) Sami Bey was appointed Consul-General for Khorasan and arrived in Meshed on March 17th 1923. His appoint ment was astonishing because there are no Turkish subjects in Khorasan. The real object of his being appointed to Meshed has been definitely established. His instructions were to con duct openly and vigorously an on/i-British campaign with a view to destroying any prestige the British might have in Khorasan: Widen the breach between the Russians and the British and to use the Russians as an additional lever to damage British prestige. (9) He commenced his work immediately after his arrival in Meshed and freely denounced the British as the greatest enemy of Islam. He lost no opportunity to speak against the British, for at every public function whe ther Persian, Afghan, Turkish or Russian he attackedthe British openly and unmercifully. Examples of his utterances can be found in H. B. M. Consul-Gene ral’s Diaries from March 1923—November 1923. (10) Those who know him personally are inclined to like him for his jovial appearance and genial manner. ^The Persians in Meshed were, at first, enthusiastic about him but during the latter period of his stay in Meshed appeared to have become rather tired of his blusterings and blow hard style. * (11) He is unquestionably a very clever individual, well edu cated, widely travelled and has literary tendencies. He has travelled practically all over the world and is now engaged in the work of writing a book on his travels and experiences both before and during the war. It is understood 10 chapters of the book have already been completed. An informant who has read these chapters states that the book is absorbingly interesting and will be of wonderful interest to all classes but more especially to the Services and those interested in Politics. 12. Sami Bey speaks French, English, Persian and Arabic. SAMI BEY’S STAFF. (1) Tahsin Beg 1st assistant to Sami Bey. Aged 30. Born near Samsun. Father was a land-owner. At the outbreak of war Tahsin Beg was at school in Berlin but returned to Constantinople a few months after the war commenced. During the war he was sent to Moscow and later was an extra assistant at the Turkish Legation there. Taking after his father he is a Royalist and had no sympathy with the Turkish nationalists. Has a distinct disregard if not contempt for the Bolshevils. Is regarded as a clever individual, honest, straightforward and sensible. Tahsin Beg is a man with whom it is possible to discuss any matter fairly and squarely and is prepared to admit that he admires the British.”8 He speaks French, Russian, German, Arabic and Persian, ^2) Farridun Bey. Turk. Secretary. Aged 26. An inexperienced youth who simply followed the policy of his master Sami Bey. His father was a prominent member of the Young Turk harbour ^ ^ n ° W 811 accounlant at Constantinople During the war Farridun Bey was with Fakhri Pasha (now in Kabul) in Medina with the Red Crescent. In Meshed he married the daughter of Majid Beg Effendioff a Caucasian Turk who till recently was employed in the Russian Consulate. Farridun Bey is a well educated youth but easy going and indifferent regarding political matters.
