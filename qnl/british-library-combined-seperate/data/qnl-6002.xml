The discussion in the volume relates specifically to the view of the Government of India on Sir Henry Arthur McMahon's correspondence and negotiations with Ḥusayn bin ‘Alī al-Hāshimī, Grand Sharif of Mecca. The volume is divided into two parts. The first part (IOR/L/PS/10/525/1) is particularly focussed on discussion of negotiations with Jemal Pasha.Further discussion surrounds the advance on Baghdad, the protection of Muslim shrines and the deferment of any public pronouncement on the caliphate until Baghdad has been captured by British forces.The principal correspondents in the volume include: the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Sir Edward Grey); the Secretary of State for India; the Viceroy (Charles Hardinge); and the Sherif of Mecca (Ḥusayn bin ‘Alī al-Hāshimī).The volume comprises parts 3-4 of 6 parts. Both parts include a divider which gives the subject and part numbers, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in that part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Insurrections</topic></subject><subject><topic>First World War campaigns</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Grand Sharif of Mecca</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Permanent Under-Secretary of State for India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Egypt</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Syria</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baghdad</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Middle East</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Arabian Peninsula</geographic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Rebellions</topic></subject><subject><topic>Muslims</topic></subject><subject><topic>International conflicts</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001a4#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001a4#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001a4#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
