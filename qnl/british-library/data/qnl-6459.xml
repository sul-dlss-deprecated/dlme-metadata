Memorandum by Mr. Baring. Sir Henry RawKnson, in his Memorandum of 23rd June last, ^ives it as ms opinion that the difficulties which beset the opening up of the Karun llvei * ai outweigh the advantages to be gained. He further considers that it would lie infinitely better to urge the Persian Government to construct a waggon road from Bushire to Shiraz, and so on to Ispahan and Tehran, than to attempt to utilize either the Bakhtyari or Luristan routes. No one is more thoroughly qualified than Sir Henry Rawlinson to give an opinion on anything connected with Persia, and no one has more attentively studied the history, geography, and resources of that country. It is, therc- with much diffidence that I venture even in a very slight degree to diner from opinions issuing from so great an authority. First, as regards the Karun itself, I freely admit that the difficulties offered by the “Bund’ at Ahwaz have been vastly underrated. When I visited the locality I had read Mr. Mackenzie’s report, and arrived there with the impression that the obstructions to navigation might be removed by a few charges of dynamite. Instead of slight obstructions I found three formidable barriers of rock stretching right across the stream, and which I describe in my report (page 17), and a fall of about seven feet. I quite agree with Sir Henry Bawlinson that the idea of a canal must be set aside. It would be a costly undertaking, for which neither the Persian Government nor a private company would be likely to find the funds. I see, however, fewer objections to a tramway. Its construction would not, I imagine, entail great expense. Starting from a point a little below the lower island, it would pass to the east of the village of Alrwaz, striking the river just above the “ Kale.” I do not think the distance would be more than If miles. There are many objections to transshipment; it is troublesome, risky, and expensive, but the difficulties attending it do not appear to me to be such as would warrant the entire rejection of the whole Karun navigation scheme. Transshipment would, of course, require a double set of vessels, i.e., steamers to convey goods to Ahwaz, and then others to continue the voyage above the “ Bund.” It is a question, however, whether for the latter part of the journey tugs and lighters would not be better and cheaper. I entirely agree with Sir Henry Rawlinson as to the impracticability of the Bakhtyari route, and I think I have said enough in my report to prove that, in my opinion, the difficulties cannot be overcome. One argument in its favour was that Hussein Kuli Khan, the Eelkhani, had established order in the country, and would protect caravans. I hear, however, now that he has been put to death. Moreover, from what the Eelkani said to me himself, it was quite clear that, though he would protect travellers and caravans, he had no wish to see a good road made through his mountain fastnesses. I now come to the third part of the question, viz., the road from Dizful to Khoremabad, Burujird, &amp;c. I have never travelled over any portion of the country north of Dizful, whereas Sir Henry Rawlinson has been to Khoremabad by two roads. Neither do I know the road from Shiraz to Bushire, except from the accounts of the numerous travellers who pass that way, so that I cannot draw any comparison between the two. The last European who has travelled between Khoremabad and Dizful is Mr. Schindler, who wrote a description of his journey in the Journal of the2 Berlin Geographical Society. In April last I drew up a memorandum, con densing the information supplied by Mr. Schindler, and which was forwarded to Earl Granville by Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. Mr. Schindler gives five routes from Khoremabad to Dizful, of which two may be at once dismissed as impracticable. He says the longest road by Taidar is practicable for artillery, and this information is borne out by what I heard at Dizful. Sir Henry Rawlinson, however, states that the road is not less difficult than the one between Bushire and Shiraz. Mr. Schindler then describes two other roads, one 156 miles in length, through the Chimishk Pass to Dehliz, and then by Badamek and Yelmian; the other, 133 miles in length, the same as the above as far as Dehliz, and then by Moukhbir-abad and Pirinjzar to Rizze. The first route, though longer, appears to be rather the better of the two. I have spoken with Mr. Schindler on the subject of communication between Dizful and Khoremabad, and he has assured me most positively that, without any very great expenditure, the roads he travelled over might be put into good order. I quite admit the objection raised with regard to the insecurity of the country. The Lur tribes are lawless to a degree, and not in the least anxious to see their country opened up. But have not other parts of Persia been at times notorious for insecurity, and has not the Persian Government been able to render them pretty secure ? It is not so very long ago that robberies were of frequent occurrence between Shiraz and Bushire, and Shiraz and Ispahan; but Ferhad Mirza, when Prince Governor of Ears, by the exercise of unsparing severity, managed to restore order. The country between Behbehan and Shiraz, inhabited by the Kohgelu and Mamasseni tribes, was at one time so unsafe that travelling was well nigh impossible. When I passed through these districts, however, there was comparatively little danger, owing to the strong measures that had been taken by Eerhad Mirza and his son the Ihtisham-ed-Dowleh. The Zel-es-Sultan, under whose authority Luristan is, is an energetic ruler, and one who is not likely to shrink from the strongest repressive measures, and I cannot but think that he both could and would render the road from Dizful to Khoremabad as safe as many other provinces of Persia. Were a metalled road made from Bushire to Shiraz, I presume it would pass by Eirozabad, as the gradients on that line are easier. This route has, however, always been very insecure. I am most unwilling to set up my opinion against that of Sir II. Rawlinson, but I confess I should somewhat regret the complete abandonment of the Karun scheme, as I still cling to the idea that we should derive commercial as w ell as political advantages, v r ere it thrown open to our ships. I have not, unfortunately, yet received from Persia my maps, notes, and certain books of reference, which would be useful to me in treating of this subject, but as far as I remember the distance from Shuster to Tehran, by w r ay of Dizful, Khoremabad, Burujird, and Kom, is about 480 miles, a gain of 320 miles land carriage on the Bushire route. My theory is that w e could place our goods in the Tehran market by the Karun route at a cheaper rate than it is possible for us to do now, and that we should also open up for our trade provinces in which we, at present, cannot compete with Russia. Ispahan w r ould, I fear, suffer, and this, no doubt, is a matter for consideration, as the market is an important one. There is one objection to the scheme of which I w as not aware wdien I wrote my report in January last. Enclosure No. 5 in Colonel Ross’s Despatch to the Government of India, of 12th January last, contains Messrs. Gray Paul’s view's as to what terms they would require to make it w orth their while to run steamers on the Karun. They demand exclusive rights of navigation for 50 years. Now, Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, in bringing the question before the Shah’s Government, has alw r ays pointed to the fact that w r e w-ere not seeking for a monopoly. We opposed Dr. Tholozan’s scheme, which was a monopoly of the most complete description, on the grounds that it was an infringement of Baron Reuter’s concession. Could we now apply for the exclusive rights without which Messrs. Gray Paul declare they could not entertain the project ? What is necessary for our interests is that, w r ere the Karun openedto all comers, we should be the first in the field. If British merchants in the Gulf held back, their place would probably soon be taken by the French, who have shown considerable signs of wishing to gain a footing in Southern Persia, and who, once established, could not easily be dislodged. Whether the Karun scheme be dropped or not, there is another route from the Persian Gulf which I think is worthy of attention. I allude to the one from Bushire to Ispahan by way of l)ilam, Behbehan, and Komesheh. The country between the two latter places has never been travelled over by a European, and it would be interesting were it properly surveyed by a com petent person. Natives assert that the road is not difficult, and I fancy there can be no obstacles between Bushire and Bchbehan, except perhaps streams which would have to be bridged. A bridge would have to be made over the Terahi before the route could be used for wheeled traffic. Lisbon, 20th September 1882.

It argues that the Karun River scheme should not be completely abandoned, and that the transhipment of goods could bypass the natural obstruction to steam vessels at Ahwaz [Ahvāz]. It also includes some discussion of some of the overland routes into Persia.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Walter Baring</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Karun River</geographic></subject><subject><topic>River navigation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000073#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
