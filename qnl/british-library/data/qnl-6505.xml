Mr. Ellis to Vis count Palmerston, 15th January 1836. Page 7, Corre spondence, Persia and Affghanistan. Sir J. Mc.Neill to Lord Palmerston, 11th April 1838. 1851-57. At the beginning of the eighteenth century Seistan, Herat, and Candahar were more or less subject to Persia. The sovereignty over these places was strengthened by Nadir Shah, who, moreover, ruled Cabul, Balkh, Bokhara, and, in a lesser degree, the Punjaub. On the assassination of Nadir Shah in 1747, a short period of anarchy ensued, but ultimately Ahmed Shah was, in 1752, crowned at Candahar, as head of the Affghan nation; he wrested the Punjab, Cabul, Seistan, and Herat from Persia, and founded the Affghan monarchy. Ahmed Shah died in 1773, when Seistan and other outlying provinces asserted their claims to independence. Seistan in particular, from not having taken part in the dissensions of that period, was ignored for a long period by both Persia and Affghanistan. Dost Mahomed, on his accession to the throne of Affghanistan in 1826, desired to bring Seistan more directly under his rule, but was too fully occupied elsewhere. Meanwhile Persia bestirred herself to extend her empire to the limits that existed under Nadir Shah. The British Government resisted her extended schemes of conquest, which are said to have included Herat, Seistan, Candahar, to a limit as far as Ghiznee. The remonstrances of successive British Ministers at Teheran were frequent, and in the same sense as written in 1836, viz., “ I feel quite assured that the “ British Government cannot permit the extension “ of the Persian Monarchy in the direction of Aff- “ ghanistan, with a due regard to the tranquillity of “ India; that extension will at once bring Russian “ influence to the threshhold of our empire.” This policy was studiously followed, and involved the British Government in hostile relations with Persia, who strenuously endeavoured to unite Herat and Candahar (to which last Seistan proper was considered tributary) under a Chief who was to be “ nominally subject to Persia but actually under the “ protection of Russia.” The failures of Persia before Herat induced her to limit her attention to Seistan, and from 1838 to 1851 the Persian Minister lost no opportunity of establishing an influence over that Province, a policy which was still opposed by the British Government. In 1857 Ali Khan, the chief ruler of Seistan, was induced to go to Teheran, forced to marry a Persian Princess, and to acknowledge allegiance to the Shah. His proceedings, however, were unpopular with his brother Chiefs and his own people, and on his re turn the following year to his capital, he was, in consequence, cruelly murdered. 16583. A•2 Seeing the aggressive spirit by which Persia was actuated in regard to Herat and Seistan, Lord Malmesbury wrote in the following language,— “ Her Majesty’s Government most “ distinctly declare that they will not “ allow any systematic attempt on “ the part of Persia to effect a change “ in the state of possession in the “ countries lying between the Persian “ frontier and the British territories “ in India.” Matters at last came to an open rupture between Great Britain and Persia, followed by the siege of Herat by the Persians, the war of 1856, and the Treaty of 1857. Lord Cowley, in his conversations with the Persian Ambassador during the nego tiations, held the same language as before, viz., that Her Majesty’s Go vernment were “ determined that “ Persia should not disturb the “ existing state of the tribes on her “ eastern frontier.” The general sense of this language was embodied in Articles V., VI., and VII. of the Treaty* of 4th March 1857. Lord Canning, then Governor Ge neral of India, in a letter to Dost dated 23rd April 1857, promised to send His Highness a copy of an autho rized Persian version of this Treaty, and further, on 6th June 1858, His Excellency forwarded f an English version, promising again to transmit at a later date the formal authorized version in Persian. On every occasion on which Persia put forward claims to Seistan, the British Government steadily con tended that the Shah had no right in that province, and the British Minister at Teheran stated even that its oc cupation by Persian troops would be considered a direct and open infringe ment J of the Treaty of Paris. But in 1859, Mr. Eastwick (then Assistant Secre tary, Political Department, India Office) drew up a memorandum,§ tending to show that Persia was not so entirely in the wrong as had been hitherto held in the assertion of her claim to Seistan. This led to a less decided || tone on the part of the British Government in regard to controversies with the Persian Government respecting the sove reignty of Seistan. So matters remained till 1862, when Dost Ma homed prepared to march against Herat, and threatened an occupation of Seistan. The Shah of Persia claimed the intervention of the British Go vernment^ under the terms of the Treaty of Paris. The India Office,** to whom the matter was re- Minister for Foreign Affairs to Teheran Mission, 27th Oct. 1852. * “ Article 5. “ His Majesty the Shah of Persia engages further to take immediate “ measures for withdrawing from the territory and city of Herat, and “ from every other part of Affghanistan, the Persian troops and autho- £ ‘ rities now stationed therein; such withdrawal to be effected within “ three months from the date of the exchange of the ratifications of this “ Treaty. “ Article 6. “ His Majesty the Shah of Persia agrees to relinquish all claims to ‘ sovereignty over the territory and city of Herat and the countries of £ Affghanistan, and never to demand from the Chiefs of Herat, or of the ‘ countries of Affghanistan, any marks of obedience, such as the coinage, ' or ‘khootbeh,’ or tribute. “ His Majesty further engages to abstain hereafter from all inter ference with the internal affairs of Afighanistan. His Majesty ‘ promises to recognize the independence of Herat and of the whole of &lt;£ Affghanistan, and never to attempt to interfere with the independence £ of those States. ££ In case of differences arising between the Government of Persia and £ the countries of Herat and Affghanistan, the Persian Government £ engages to refer them for adjustment to the friendly offices of the £ British Government, and not to take up arms unless these friendly £ offices fail of effect. ££ The British Government, on their part, engage at all times to exert £ their influence with the States of Affghanistan, to prevent any cause £ of umbrage being given by them, or by any of them, to the Persian £ Government; and the British Government, when appealed to by the £ Persian Government, in the event of difficulties arising, will use their £ best endeavours to compose such differences in a manner just and £ honourable to Persia. “Article 7. “In case of any violation of the Persian frontier by any of the States “ referred to above, the Persian Government shall have the right, if due “ satisfaction is not given, to undertake military operations for the “ repression and punishment of the aggressors ; but it is distinctly “ understood and agreed to that any military force of the Shah which “ may cross the frontier for the above-mentioned purpose shall retire “ within its own territory as soon as its object is accomplished, and that “ the exercise of the above-mentioned right is not to be made a pretext “ for the permanent occupation by Persia, or for the annexation to the “ Persian dominions, of any town or portion of the said States.” f Enclosure to Secret Letters from India. 23rd July 1858, p. 634.

During all this period, however, the Persian Government had been disbursing large subsidies to the Seistan Chiefs, and otherwise taking initiatory steps for the annexation of the province. Dost Mahomed died before Herat, 9th June 1863, and Affghanistan was plunged into a general civil war. Meanwhile the Persian Government continued to make references about Seistan. In November 1863f Lord Russel], then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, again referred the matter to the India Office, consequent on a further appeal from the Persian Minister that Her Majesty’s Government should prevent any invasion by the Affghans of' the territory of Seistan. Lord Russell proposed to state, in reply, that “ Her Majesty’s Government, “ being informed that the title to the territory of “ Seistan is disputed between Persia and Aff- “ ghanistan, must decline to interfere in the matter, “ and must leave it to both parties to make good “ their possession by force of arms.” Sir C. Wood, then Secretary of State for India, approved of the tenor of the proposed reply, which was subsequently signed by Lord Russell, on 5th November 1863. This correspondence was not, however, commu nicated to the Government of India till 1870, so that neither they nor the Amir of Cabul were aware of so important a decision on the part of Her Majesty’s Government. The Persian Government were not long in taking advantage of the permission implied in Lord Russell’s Despatch. The Shah, indeed, occupied the province with Persian troops during the most distracted period of anarchy in Affghanistan, when the ruler of that country was utterly powerless to resist encroachment. But when Shere Ali subsequently consolidated his power in Affghanistan in 1868-69, matters began to assume a different aspect, and the Amir began indirectly to hint to the British Government that, if allowed to do so, he was quite able to take his own part in the matter of recovering the Pro vince of Seistan. So much, indeed, were the Government of India impressed with the urgency of the case, that they not only invited the attention of Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran to the matter, but they also addressed a letter to the Secretary of State for India, bringing to the notice of Her Majesty’s Go vernment the repeated encroachments of Persia in the direction of the frontiers of Affghanistan, Seistan, Khelat, and Mekran, with the view, ifpossible, to the commencement of negotiations, through Her Majesty’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, to place matters on a more sound and satisfactory footing than heretofore, and to put an end to the irritating contentions and the possibility of war arising from the uncertain and ill-defined boundaries. The papers were duly forwarded to the Foreign Office, who proposed to defer any action in the matter till the arrival in this country of Mr. Alison, Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran, who was shortly expected. This was agreed to by the India Office. The above letter from the Government of India was written shortly before the meeting of Lord Mayo and Shere Ali at Umballa, on 27th March 1869, when it was anticipated that allusion would be made by the Amir to the encroachments of Persia eastwards. It is believed that the Amir, through his confidential ministers, spoke strongly on this subject in private conferences, though the official report received from the Government of India in connexion with the meeting made no reference thereto; and it was stated in the Enclosures of a subsequent Despatch that “no communications were received “ from or made to the Amir of Cabul during the “ conferences at Umballa with regard to His High- “ ness’s relations with the Persian Empire.” How ever, subsequently there are repeated allusions in the Cabul Diaries to the wish of Shere Ali to take his own part respecting Seistan, if allowed so to do by the British Government. Nor, on the other hand, was Persia at all at ease respecting the security of her recently acquired possessions in Seistan. So serious did events seem that the Government of India, in June 1869, brought the matter to the notice of Her Majesty’s Government, stating that difficulties might at any time arise, owing to the claims assumed by Persia in respect to her eastern frontier. It must be remembered that the Amir had often expressed his desire to retake Seistan, and had been only restrained by the personal advice and influence of the Governor General of India. On receiving this Despatch of June 1869, the Duke of Argyll suggested to the Foreign Office that, as Mr. Alison was in England, no delay should occur in coming to a definite conclusion, on the part of Her Majesty’s Government, as to the policy which it was desirable to pursue with respect to the deter mination of the boundaries in question. The Foreign Office, in reply, forwarded copy of a letter from Mr. Alison, raising objection to any diplomatic action on the part of Her Majesty’s Go vernment. This correspondence was in due course forwarded to the Government of India, who thereupon com bated the objections put forward by Mr. Alison, and again urged the necessity of some action on the part of Her Majesty’s Government relative to the eastern frontier of Persia, more especially as regards Khelat, against whose territories in Mekran Persia was then actively carrying on aggression, in addition to esta blishing her supremacy in Seistan.

Copy of this Despatch, and of three others on the same subject, was forwarded to the Foreign Office on 23rd December 1869, with an expression of opinion, on the part of the Duke of Argyll, that the time had arrived when Her Majesty’s Govern ment could no longer delay adopting a definite line of policy in respect to the pretensions of Persia eastwards. Meanwhile two intermediate Despatches had been received from the Government of India reiterating the necessity for the delineation of the eastern frontier of Persia, in order to avoid the inevitable complications that would otherwise arise. These were duly forwarded to the Foreign Office on the 5th and 8th of October respectively, with an intimation that the Duke of Argyll, while concurring with the Government of India, would be glad to have an exposition of Lord Clarendon’s views on the course to be pursued. To these several communications the Foreign Office did not send any formal reply. They ap pear, however, with the consent of the India Office, to have informed their representative at Teheran that the British Government would be always ready, in a friendly spirit, to assist in the arrangement of difficulties which might have arisen in regard to Mekran between the Shah and the Khan of Khelat. Such was the position of affairs at the commence ment of 1870, when the question of Seistan again came up. Lord Clarendon, then Secretary of State for Foreign Aftairs, caused a letter to be sent to the India Office, stating that the Persian Minister at this Court had informed him that in structions had been received from the Shah’s Govern ment to represent their apprehension that Shere Ali, of Cabul, was about to re-assert Affghan claims over Seistan, whereas a Persian Government was already established in that province. The Minister accord ingly requested that the Indian Government might be desired to use its influence with Shere Ali to prevent him carrying his supposed intentions into effect. The Foreign Office letter proceeds thus,— “ The Duke of Argyll will judge what should be “ said to the Indian Government with reference to “ Mohsin Khan’s communication, and Lord Claren- “ don would be glad to receive any observations “ that may occur to His Grace to make upon it.” The Duke of Argyll replied, under date 21st February 1870, expressing his opinion as follows,— “ If the Government of the Shah of Persia is “ willing to submit the question referred to the “ arbitration of the British Government, in accord- “ ance with the terms of Article VI. of the Treaty “ of Paris, March 1857,* his Grace will place him- “ self in communication with Lord Mayo, with “ reference to the expediency of obtaining from the “ Amir Shere Ali Khan his acquiesence in the “ proposed arrangement.” On receipt of this letter, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs instructed Mr. Thompson, Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Teheran, to submit the proposal for arbitration to the Persian Govern- 16583. B6 ment, and to recommend their concurrence in the same. This concurrence was given in the following words,—“ They (the Persian Government) are “ willing to make Her Majesty’s Ministers arbiters “ in the matter of sovereignty and boundaries, &amp;c., &amp;.c ” Whilst this correspondence as to Seistan was being carried on, affairs in Mekran became very unsettled, so much so, that Mr. Thompson, Her Majesty’s Charg6 d’Affaires at Teheran, reported to Lord Clarendon, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that he believed that the Government of Persia would “ not be induced to adopt sufficiently “ stringent measures for restraining their agents “ on the frontier from all interference with the “ Khelat territory, unless a further representation “ be made to them by Her Majesty’s Government, “ giving them clearly to understand that, beyond “ certain limits, Persia must abstain altogether “ from military operations in Mekran, and that her “ officers must be prevented from attempting any “ encroachment upon the territory now in pos- “ session of the Khan of Khelat, pending a formal “ investigation of her claims in that quarter.” Upon this the Duke of Argyll caused a letter to be addressed to the Foreign Office, inquiring “ whether any and what notice was to be taken “ by Lord Clarendon of the suggestion contained “ therein.” The letter of instructions sent by the Foreign Office in reply to Mr. Thomson’s communication, while touching upon the general question of frontier encroachments on the part of Persia, makes no allusion to the concluding portion of that Officer’s above-mentioned letter. In the following month Lord Clarendon caused a telegram from Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Teheran to be trans mitted to this Office, the purport of which was a proposal of the Shah respecting the settlement of the Mekran boundary. His Majesty’s exact words were,— “ Respecting Khelat, the demarcation of boundaries “ between Persia, Beluchistan, and Khelat has not “ yet been clearly defined. If the British Govern- “ ment is desirous that the said line of frontier be “ traced, let Commissioners be sent by the three “ parties to the frontier, that is to say, by England, “ Persia, and Khelat, and let them settle the “ boundary line, otherwise, if the frontier be not “ defined, these difficulties will be daily recurring.” Mr. Thomson at this time wrote to Mirza Saeed Khan, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, that His Excellency might feel assured that Her Majesty’s Government would be prepared, in a friendly spirit, to assist in the arrangement of any difficulties which might have arisen between His Majesty the Shah and the Khan of Khelat. The Foreign Office forwarded, for the considera tion of the Secretary of State for India, the above- mentioned proposal made by the Shah for submitting the case to arbitration. The Duke of Argyll re plied that, if Lord Clarendon concurred in the Basis of Seistaip Arbitration. Letter from Foreign Office, 21st April 1870. Letter from Foreign Office, 7th March 1870.

Lord Clarendon assented. On 3rd May the Foreign Office forwarded copy of a letter from Mr. Thomson, at Teheran, de tailing a conversation which had taken place between himself and the Shah of Persia, when the latter “ appealed to Her Majesty’s Government to “ interfere, and use their influence to restrain the “ Affghan Chief from invading or interfering with “ Seistan.” Whereupon the Duke of Argyll caused a letter to be addressed to the Foreign Office, stating *# * « that, in His Grace’s opinion, it would “ be desirable to lose no time in making the neces- “ sary arrangements for the proposed Seistan arbi- “ tration, the more especially as it appears, from “ the enclosures to your letter of 3rd May, and “ from Mr. Thomson’s, No. 23, of March 8th, that “ incursions across the Perso-Affghan border have “ been made from both sides, and it would seem “ that further hostilities are threatening. It ap- “ pears to the Duke of Argyll that it would be “ advisable to despatch an officer of rank and ex- “ perience from this country, with instructions from “ Her Majesty’s Government; and, with the con- “ currence of Lord Clarendon, His Grace would “ request Colonel Goldsmid, who has a large ex- “ perience on both sides of the frontier, and “ possesses a thorough knowledge of the Persian “ language, and a personal acquaintance with the “ local authorities of both countries, to under- “ take this important mission.” * * * Lord Clarendon, on the part of the Foreign Office, con curred in these views, but, while approving the selection of Colonel Goldsmid, presumed that he would be instructed to communicate unreservedly with Her Majesty’s Minister in Persia on all matters connected with the arbitration. This was done, and Colonel Goldsmid was directed, while considering himself under the orders of Her Majesty’s Government, and addressing his commu nications to the Duke of Argyll, to keep Mr. Alison acquainted with the progress and proceedings of the mission. As a matter of fact, the negotiations were carried on under the joint direction of the Govern ment of India and the British Minister at Teheran, the settlement of the various points from time to time raised during the discussions at tbat capital being in great measure in the hands of the latter officer, who was for the most part the medium of com munication between Colonel Goldsmid and the Persian Government, and who, after the departure of the Mission from Teheran, had the entire con duct of all subsequent diplomatic negotiations. Turning again to Mekran, we find that, on 31st of the same month (May), the Foreign Office in quired “ what answer His Grace would wish to be 16583. C8 “ returned to the proposal of the Shah, for the “ settlement by a mixed Commission of the Mekran “ frontier question.” Whereupon the Duke of Argyll replied that he “ entirely approved of the “ suggestion, and that he was of opinion that “ Colonel Goldsmid, either before or after the “ Seistan arbitration, as might be determined by “ Her Majesty’s Government, might advantageously “ be employed on this duty as British Commis- “ sioner.” Lord Clarendon agreed, and instructed Mr. Alison to inform the Persian Government that “ Her Ma- “ jesty’s Government, being desirous of meeting the' “ wishes of the Shah, are willing to agree to His “ Majesty’s proposal, and Colonel Goldsmid, who tf has been selected to act as Commissioner on the “ part of Great Britain, will be directed to proceed “ to the Mekran frontier either before or after the “ settlement of the Seistan Arbitration.” It was originally intended that Colonel Goldsmid should commence his investigation in Seistan, and his instructions, signed by the Duke of Argyll, with the concurrence of the Earl Granville, were framed with that idea; in consequence, however, of dis turbances in Affghanistan, whereby it was rendered impracticable for the Amir to send his Commissioner, the plan was changed, and in 1870 he commenced the Mekran Arbitration. * The British Commissioner was employed upon this duty for some months, and returned to Teheran in July 1871, to discuss the results of his work and to effect, if possible, a settlement through the medium of Her Majesty’s Minister. After a pro longed negotiation, in which the Shah himself took an active part, a decisive note,J defining the boun daries of the litigating States, was given in by Mr. Alison, and accepted by the Persian Govern ment. Mr. Alison took this step under the autho rity of the Foreign Office; at the same time, the India Office concurred. Subsequently, when the modification of the Mekran Frontier was under consideration, Mr. Alison, the representative of the Imperial Government, himself designated the decision in the Arbitration as being that of Her Majesty’s Minister for Foreign Affairs. On the termination of the Mekran inquiry in August 1871, Colonel Goldsmid held himself in readiness to commence the Seistan negotiations. At this time a long correspondence took place between Mr. Alison, Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran, and the Persian Government, as to the exact terms on which the latter would finally agree to refer the case to arbitration, the general principles having been arranged in April 1870. The precise words used by Mr. Alison in reporting the conclusion of these preliminary negotiations were as follows,— “ After a lengthened discussion the King has accepted our arbitration in the following terms,— ‘ When the British, Persian, and Affghan Commis- ‘ sioners are all assembled together in Seistan, the * Persian and the Affghan Commissioners respec- Letter to Foreign Office, 3rd June 1870.

The history of the Seistan arbitration need not here be recapitulated. It is sufficient to state that, as in the Mekran, so in the Seistan arbitration, the final decision was given by Lord Granville, Secre tary of State for Foreign Affairs. Meanwhile Sir F. Goldsmid finished his labours and presented his accounts. These were duly ex amined by the Auditor, after which the following letter was addressed to the Foreign Office, asking them to pay half the expenses of Sir F. Goldsmid’s mission 44 With reference to the recent mission in charge of Sir F. Goldsmid, under the orders of the Foreign and India Offices, for the settlement of the Perso- Seistan and Mekran boundaries, I am directed by the Marquis of Salisbury to state that the accounts, so far as at present adjusted, show an expenditure on the above behalf of 39,880/. 17.?. 2d. I have accordingly to request that you will cause the half of that sum to be paid into the Treasury of this Office. I am to add, that there will probably be a fur ther sum of about 10,000/. to be paid by the Impe rial Treasury, being half the amount advanced in India on the same account. As, however, full par ticulars of the expenditure have not yet reached this Office, the adjustment of this latter sum must, for the present, be deferrred.” The reply from the Foreign Office is quoted in full as follows:— 44 Lord Derby has been in communication with the Lords of the Treasury with regard to the claim put forward in your letter of 22nd June, to be repaid from the Imperial Exchequer, a moiety ofm 10 the expenses incurred by Sir Frederic Goldsmid, under the orders of the Imperial Government, in the settlement of the Perso-Seistan and Mekran boundaries; and I am directed by his Lordship to state to you, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, that, as the Foreign Office has not incurred any obligation to defray any portion of the expenses of this Commission, which, as more directly concerning India, was ori ginated by and continued under the directions of the India Office, Lord Derby regrets that he would not feel justified in consenting to charge any part of the expenditure in question to Imperial revenues.” O.
