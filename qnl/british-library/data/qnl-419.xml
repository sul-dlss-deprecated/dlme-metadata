You will notice that the whole of the Persian Gulf, including even Basrah, is included by them in “ British India,” and the American subject promises not to transgress the laws of British India while residing in Muscat, a State with which the American Government itself has a treaty. I should he inclined to attribute the extra activity shown by the missionaries at the moment to the personal energy of Dr. Harrison, and any anti-British bias to the strong Dutch sentiments of the Rev. Dykstra. I hazard a conjecture that if the latter were to take his departure, there would be little further ground for this complaint. In support of this is the attitude of the mission at Koweit, which I have always understood to be definitely friendly to British influence. However, the propaganda work undertaken to win over the Islamic conservative could equally well servo to conciliate all classes. One caution; the most conservative Arab on the whole island used to be Shaikh Isa himself ; he certainly seems to have modified his attitude lately, but I am not sure that he would quite swallow the new municipality. In any case, his susceptibilites would have to be very carefully considered. Shaikh Abdulla’s visit to Europe should certainly yield very valuable results in this direction, if his mind is not too crowded with impressions, and if he can avoid exciting the jealousy of his brothers on his return. It is little use saying anything about Nejd and Hasa under present circumstances. As far as I understand the situation, the fact is now well in the fire, and we can only wait for the results. However it would do no harm at all for Biay to go deeply into the question of machine pumps, and bring out pots of good literature on the subject. If the present crisis gives birth to anything like a really stable government in Persia, I have plenty of projects of the kind. As regards the steam tug I am writing to you separately. The above covers the ground as regards Bahrein, I think. The net result is that assuming the new policy, all that is necessary is money for propaganda work, with a view to the establishment, as soon as possible, of a good school and a strong municipality. Bray’s other desiderata are points of detail. Next to Bahrein, we have Qatar and the Trucial Coast. I should be in clined to deal with them together, as they are in the same stage of primitiveness and the Political Agent, Bahrein, will have his hands full with Bray’s programme. The first condition of any advance in those regions is the establishment of a Political Agency, at suggested by Sir Percy at intervals from 1911 to the out break of war. You doubtless remember the Zora correspondence ; Zora was event ually abandoned, but every year on the approach of the cold weather Sir Percy asked whether the post and telegraph scheme for Debai could be proceeded with, and every year some reason was found which prevented action till the approach of the hot weather. Government never, as far as I can discover, agreed to the establishment of an Agency, but in his despatch No. 1112 of 30th April 1911, Sir Percy said “once our telegraph station was installed the rest would gradually follow, automatically ” ; and it is difficult to imagine anything as “ the aest ” except the establishment of a regular Agency. The idea at the time was that New might run over occasionally from,Lingah; but I regard this as a very unsatisfactory compromise. There would be no practical difficulty that I can see, if the nettle were grasped firmly enough ; the Shaikhs in general, and the Shaikh of Debai in particular, would be reminded of the old correspondence about posts and telegraphs, and their obligations under the agreement, and notified that we were about to open up a post and telegraph office at Debai, as the most central spot. This communication would be conveyed by the Resident or Deputy in the “ Lawrence, *’ and the ship bringing the staff and guard would arrive the same day. There w ould he a temporary fuss, but I don’t for a moment think things would go up to boiling point. Of course, the local situalion would have to be studied beforehand more carefully than I have done this year.Of course, the Tmcial Coast and Qatar Agency would have to go slow the matter of schools, etc., for some years, but if Bahrein is to be the model Arab Principality, the Political Agent, Trucial Coast, could work slowly up to the model. Mascat. —I need hardly mention ; there are enough schemes on foot for its development. Persian Mekran is a source of continual anxiety to me. ' There can be no doubt that the whole province is in a thoroughly unsatisfactory state, and unless we assert ourselves in some forcible way, it will not be possible to carry out the annual repairs of the land line next cold weather. I only propose at the moment a repetition of Keyes’ Mission, with a commission to report on the best political arrangements for the future. But something of the kind abso lutely must be done, unless Government prefers the obvious alternative of abandoning the land line (we could not pull it up, without an armed party), and laying an additional cable Here again I think we shall find ourselves obliged to spend rather more money, and have permanent political representation. This would be better justified, in that I am sure the solid and responsible elements among the Baluchis would welcome it, as a good excuse for dropping their wearisome and expensive feuds. Finally, of course, if we are going in for a general' civilising mission in these waters, the coast al tract from Lin gab to Bushire offers an excellent, and absolutely vergin, field. But I think the above sketch provides enough for the time being ; and the susceptibilities of the Tehran Government would doubt less be outraged by our attempting to do any good for their nominal subjects. y Memorandum No. 6 -Cf, dated Bahrein, the 5th January 1920. {Secret.) Fr.&gt;m— Major H. K. V. Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrein, r ,. J The Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. 0 FTbe Deputy Political .Resident, Bushire. The attached note on the existing political situation in Bahrein is for warded for information. The note is compiled from close personal study and observation of the people of Bahrein during the last two months, also for valuable material left behind by my predecessor Captain N. N. E. Bray, M.C. Note on the political situation in Bahrein as existing at the end of J919, icith suggestions and proposals for improving the situation. 1. I arrived in Bahrein on November 6 th, 1919, and since my arrival I have taken pains to try and get at the bottom of the curious atmosphere of hosti lity which seems to exist everywhere in Bahrein for the foreigner and more especially towards the Agency. To accomplish my purpose I have spent much time interviewing persons, great and small, and have taken special care to get at the confidence of people by frequent visits and dinner parties at the houses of residents of all shades of opinion, both neutral, Sunni and Shiah. I have also been largely helped in my investigations by riding round among the many hamlets of the Island and chatting over a cup of coffee with the local head man surrounded by his villagers in the local guest chamber. The general conclusions that I have arrived at are enumerated below. 2. In my opinion— v (a) The political atmosphere of Bahrein while not in any way dangerous is wholly unsatisfactory. (ft) There is a strong anti-British sentiment which is long standing and deepseated. (c) British prestige rests on entirely false standards, namely on fear and not on respect. I consider our task therefore both extremely difficult, yet imperative.3. It would be quite useless were I to make the bold statements above, had not strong proofs to substantiate them and suggested remedies in different directions to rectify them. The character and methods of Shaikh ’Isa bin ’Ali al Khalifah, K.C.S.I., C.S.I., the Ruler of Bahrein, are so well known as hardly to bear repetition, yet I must perforce give a rousdi sketch of the man so as to convey the true atmosphere prevailing. Shaikh *Isa is a timid ruler, at the same time I believe he is a very loyal friend to ourselves and means extremely well by us. Friendly letter that he writes to myself either personal or for transmission to His Majesty’s Government give him almost childish pleasure, and he has been heard on several occasions to tell others of them and boast about the said friendliness. In opposition to this he is continually attempting to assert his supposed rights in an illadvised way and to cause small embarrass ments by puerile methods and easily discernable intentions. The explanation of such contrary virtues and vices is easy of explanation. His own personal feelings are undoubtedly of the friendliest nature to ourselves, those of his advisers by no means unanimous in this respect. Their reasons for their hostile attitude may be divided into two degrees:— A ” An honest one, that w r e may ourselves appreciate ; “ B ” A dishonest one ; both call for special consideration and different methods of handling. “ A *’ The honest opposition is based partly on-fear, partly on pride, partly on suspicion, inherent in Arab minds, and partly on ignorance appalling in its completeness. {i) Fear of a great power who has them so completely in its control makes them anxious to grasp and hold on to what actual freedom and liberty of action remains to them, with the constant dread that their freedom may be still further curtailed. (n) Fride, which is equally part of the Arab character, encourages them to acts that'will gain them renown, however small, in the eyes of their com patriots, and makes them equally averse to surrender an action once committed, or an attitude once assumed. Bride of comparison bears a real part in their line of thought, that is to say, their own power compared to that exercised by other Arab rulers, and the fear of loss of prestige in any curtailment of their powers in the eyes of other rulers. {Hi) Suspicion, which, as I said above, is an inherent vice or virtue, depending on the standpoint of regard in the constitution of Arab minds, and which always exists in the minds of a more or less primitive people, its degree depending on .the extent of their backwardness, as a wild animal de pends on suspicion, whilst a domesticated depends on its confidence, for its'com- fort and well being. (iv) Ignorance of anything outside their own environment is so astonishing as to merit a special paragraph to itself, and I will treat this question further on in this note. But it is a'real and distressing factor with which we have to deal. All the above are what w’e might call honest drawbacks, which we may appreciate, sympathize with and gradually remove by personal intercourse, sympathy, example and tact. The pity of it is that these characteristics are taken advantage of by those ill-disposed towards and I attribute eighty per cent, of our difficulties in our relationship with the ruler, and the present low standard of prestige, as due to them. B—Dishonest opposition. This we may take for granted comes in no inconsiderable extent from those in opposition to Shaikh Isa himself; mainly from his cousins Ali Ibrahim Rashid the sons of Mahomed al Khalifah who was formerly deposed by us, and to a certain extent from the heir presumptive. Quite apart from the natural hostility of the former family to ourselves for ousting their clan (hamoula) from the succession and their natural rights, it may be easily understood how they would be only too ready to advise Shaikh ’Isa to take a line of action that will bring him in opposition to ourselves. For they aim at nothing less than the deposition of the Shaikh himself, and clumsy diplomats as they are, they hope and never cease from attempting to accomplish this by trying tomake us lose patience with the present ruler, through his apparent obstinacy and maladministration, both of which they encourage and excite. They may therefore be said to be playing a two-handed game, one incited by.their own hopes and ambitions and the other fostered by their real hostility to ourselves, for supposed wrongs committed and natural dislike of the white foreigner, the more so as he has behind him the mighty strength of a great nation. Thus then may we sum up the character of Shaikh Tsa bin ’ Ali al Khalifah with its resultant effects on his dealings with ourselves : “ ^ Ter y old and weak man, imbued with sincere feelings of friendship and regard for His Majesty’s Government, swayed and confused in his weakness by virile and astute minds and delicate intriguers, dictated for the most part by evil intentions to himself, to us and to both—helped in this by the characteristics of Arab mentality mentioned above.” 4i. We must now turn our attention from the “Entourage” of* the RuleV to the “ Mass,” and in this direction are causes of hostility and lack of prestige no less interesting and no less delicate. For here we have the “ pawns” in the game and the material for thejedifice of hostility. We will divide them into two classes :— A—The Government officials ; B—The notables of the Islands. ^—Like all Government officials of an oriental State, we may expect to find abuse of authority and extortion, but unlike most oriental States in such close relationship to a European Power, we may be justly grieved to find th^t these exceed all bonds of propriety and sense of justice, so much so as to call forth the odium of the Arabs themselves. The Amirs or Governors of the towns of Muharraq and Manama are officials entirely unsuited for control, and the power they wield is oppressive and immoral. The Amir of Manama encourages and receives an income from prostitutes and gamblers, impresses boat and donkey transport in a shameless manner and generally extorts money from householders, shopkeepers and the peopje as a whole. The Amirs of Muharraq is little better, and would be equally as bad, were he not more or less under the supervision of the Shaikh who resides there for the greater part of the year. The Amirs being men of this stamp, it is not surprising that the “Zidawis ” (police) and officials under them follow their lead. This being so, it is obvious that any measure of reform is at once opposed by these gentlemen, and intrigues set on foot to prevent them being carried out. B—The Notables of the Island. —Of these 25 per cent, are friendly to a greater or less degree, while 75 per cent, are definitely hostile. I will attempt to describe the more important of them further on in this note, but for the present I will confine myself to anticipating the causes of our unpopularity in a general way before coming to details. These causes we may study under three headings ;— ' (i) War, {it) Normal, {Hi) Individual. (i) War. (a) Economical. —The necessary restrictions due to the war have hit the Island hard as in most other places. The prohibition of the export of silver and restrictions as to the export of rice from India during 1919 especially have caused acute hardship and discontent, but except where these have been taken advantage of by ill-disposed persons they should be speedily corrected or erradicated by the return of normal conditions, when present prohibition prices will fall an^ normal trade be resumed. Our efforts then must be directed to the removal as soon afe possible of trade restrictions made necessary by the war.(b) Propaganda .—This has left its scars, and is still existent. Th&amp; present uncertainty of future status, active pro-Turk feeling and Khilafat propaganda from India, are exercising men’s minds and providing material for hostile endeavour. This can he erradi- cated or partly reduced by measures proposed [see paragraph ??].. (ii) Normal. {q) Hanatical hostility, due to ultra-religious feeling among the Arabs; this is to be expected in a place like Bahrein, which has always taken its cue from Najd, but it can be reduced by intercourse and closer touch. (The “ Akhwan ” movement of the mainland has undoubtedly increased this feeling of hostility.) (J) Persians, due in the first place to a rather unfriendly and fanatical Shiah Persian community, but also due to recent political events in Persia, and the natural leaning of the Persian towards intrigue. (c) Ignorance .—It is difficult to credit the hopeless ignorance that exists in Bahrein, even among the best families. Those who have travelled and seen something of the world are a class apart,. But the Shaikhs (ruling house) and people generally are the most ignorant people IhaVe ever met. No story, however, impos sible is too extravagant for their credulity. Isolated to a deplor able extent, they are callous and indifferent to outside matters of any kind. I refer not to the humble and poor, but to the rich and influential. Very few can write. Geographical know ledge is appalling, politics of most amazing conception, they cannot understand the simplest measure of administration or reform, incapable of clear statement and sound reasoning, intellectually dull and naturally stupid. It is for this reason that I specially advocate at homes, weekly durbars, evening visits and a newspaper to help broaden their minds and help their judgment. (Hi) Individual. I attach a black and white list of important Bahrein individuals with a short description against each. The list is by no means complete, but is inter esting as an index to the various causes and effects it is necessary to study.

To meet and defeat these various difficulties, an energetic and open handed policy is imme&amp;mteXy imperative^ For in my opinion with so much cheap sentimentality at large in the world to-day, sue to catch phrases used for political purposes both during the world war and throughout the period of the Armistice, men’s minds, especially those of orientals, are apt to fasten on unrealities rather than on /oc^ of the outcome of the world conflagration. These ephemeral ideas are greedily fastened on to by the astute Arab mind and especially by those unfriendly to us, and if British prestige is not to suffer, I submit a change of manner in dealing with these people is essential. And the primary duty of a Political Officer in these serious times is to break away from the fetters of the past and enter a wider and freer sphere of political thought'lest British domina tion or control appear weak-kneed and sentimental. Added to this the general upset due to the war, the doubts and uncertainties, propaganda and dislocation of trade with its necessary hardship necessitates infusing energy and wideness of vision into our work in order to lead minds unbalanced by recent events into same channels. {b) A closer touch with individuals who have the least influence in educating public opinion, with the closest possible study of their individuality and especially, if hostile, their reasons for hostility. The Political Officer must be the doctor of his charge and know accurately the medicine required for each of his patients. It is impossible for the senior political officers to have leisure to do this except in the case of men of real importance, but so well should they be sured by their junior lieutenants that the exact tune and mentality of any particular place can be clearly and accurately sounded. I must be pardoned if I appear to generalize, I am writing a note on Bahrein and the mainland under it, (in a junior sense) and I purposely write at length so that one’s superior officers may themselves feel the atmosphere as I feel it, and as I am about to ask for support, to give my fullest reasoning. I have started, there fore, a list of every important and fairly important personage in the place, I intend to meet them frequently to study them individually. A short visit of a few hours may easily change an enemy into a friend. I need not emphasise this aspect of political dealing that gained an Empire a hundred years ago, but has greatly fallen into disuse to our disavantage, mainly through pressure of office work. To the above end I have set apart four days in each week for calling purposes. The hours selected are from 5-30 p m. to 7 p m. between sunset prayer and the Arab’s dinner hour.(&lt;?) Entertainment and open handedness is an essential, and I intend ta hold at homes to the gentry of the place, where rumours may be corrected, and minds enlarged by social intercourse The Political Officer must be the school master of public opinion and thought. Our opponents in the past have robbed us of many things by these means, in future we must deny this to them. The King’s birthday, New Year’s day, etc., etc., must be celebrated in good style and made an occasion of entertainment on a suitable scale. {d) The public. The small shopkeeper, the man earning a small liveli hood, must be equally studied and considered, especially our own subjects and protected persons, he must feel his position not only in law suits and public matters, but also in his private life, and- small hurts and pleasures, so that his citizenship becomes something to him. I have, therefore, instituted a weekly (Monday) Darbar or Majlis at which all, or any of the above, are free to come and will be served with light refreshment to take away shyness and reserve. They will be enconraged to speak their minds, and if immediate action can be taken, it will be taken before them. Through this channel T hope firstly to gain confidence and information, and secondly to set an example to the Euler and his people. {e) Education.—The Political Officer cannot hope to educate in its literal sense, yet education on sound lines is essential if the present ignorance is to be rectified. I hope to carry through my predecessor’s proposal to have a school for British subjects and protected persons. But it must be under the supervision of the Political Officer. {h) Health .—The political importance of this subject cannot be overesti mated, or its means for progress denied. Much prejudice will have to be ridden down, the Euler in particular will have to be gradually weaned to the idea that a clean tidy city is in every way preferable to a dirty one. This, duty I have taken upon myself and hope to be able to report results before long. (g) Eeioardyfor services rendered either to ourselves or to the community, should receive frequent recognition and I can not emphasize too strongly the- enormous influence these have on the Arab mind. While not cheapening the higher decorations and distinctions, we may by a generous distribution of tire less imposing ones gain many friends and encourage honest endeavour. Often have I heard the Arab cry that he has served faithfully 10 or 20 years, but has received nothing, while his less deserving but intriguing brother has been rewarded in some incomprehensible manner. (h) Presents have their great value and are fully appreciated by Arabs,, and are a sine qua non among themselves. I do not deny that we have and do give presents, but a judicious increase in this respect will help us greatly. Foreign firms were very generous in this respect, with excellent results to themselves, and we as a Government should be no less generous. (i) Letters of appreciation or thanks are treasured and have their weight, and occasional letters from the Senior Political Officer go a very long way to cementing a friendship. An instance of this I saw only last week when in public Darbar Sheikh Abdul Latif al Dosari of Budaiyeh pulled out a black edged letter written him by Sir Percy Cox, G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., on the occasion of the late King Edward’s death. He paraded this letter with a great show and obviously placed a very high value on it. He insisted on reading it over twice to his audience. (j) Intelligence .—Even in time of peace is of the utmost importance both as a means of forestalling troubles and difficulties and guaging the trend of events. The information thus gained might be centralized in Baghdad and would yield important results. I propose in future supplying the Civil Com missioner, Baghdad, and to the Deputy Political Eesident, Bushire, with a short weekly report that will, I hope, give information that gradually may be of use, under the headings Military trade, localities, individuals, public opinion. For secret service work J require Es. 2,000 per annum. As my allotment here is fixed and I have no funds to meet such a charge, I trust Civil Com missioner, Baghdad, will grant me this sum from funds at his disposal for 1920.\ 17 Summary of matter* to be taken in hand for improving general tone. {a) Electric light {b) School (c) Water supply (d) Pearl Button Plant (e) Bank (/) Darbar f^) Visit to gentry • (k) Information (») Honours and Rewards ij) Letters of thanks (£) Newspaper .

Shaikh Isa has imported a car and also Shaikh Abdullah, his son, roads are being improved in consequence, and with a car at one’s disposal one will now be able to go over the whole island.- 20 The above being the state of mind of the Shaikh of Bahrein and his advisers, I do not think one may be surprised at the three requests made by Shaikh Abdullah in London. To turn to the three points in question. Point l —The Civil Commissioner states in his Ts T o. 12988, dated 30th October 1919. to “ Zinneremo,” London, that the matter was for all practical purposes settled when the Order-in-Council was brought into force. There are still points, however, over which a ruling is required. As 1 understand it, the term Cf neighbouring Arab Rulers” refers to the inhabitants of Qatar Peninsula and Nej l. Is it intended to refer to the inhabitants of Oman, Kuwait, Zanzibar, Hadramant, Yemen, etc., the inhabitants of all which places are to lie found here trading at all times ? In other words are local resident subjects of the Rulers of Oman, Kuwait, Zanzibar, Hejaz and inhabitants of Hadramant and Yemen to be considered under the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Bahrein or under that of the Political Agent? A ruling is required on this point as Shaikh ’Isa certainly thinks he should control them. Point 2 .—[ have nothing to say except that up to the day of his depar ture, my predecessot was carrying on a correspondence with the Shaikh of Bahrein over this very subject. The Shaikh had dismissed a member of the “Majlis-al Urfi” and had appointed another member without the knowledge or approval of the Political Agent. The circumstances suggested an attempt to make a test case to see how far the Political Agent would be supported. The Political Agent contended that under the Order-in-Council he had every right to be consulted in the matter and refused to recognise “ Majlis- al-Urfi” until Shaikh Tsa withdrew his nomination. My predecessor went away at this stage of the crises and it has been left for me to settle the tangle. I certainly consider the Order-in-Council is clear on the subject and should be insisted on. In the meantime the Majlis-aLUrfi s sittings have been sus pended pending settlement ot this vexed question. v 4 Point 3. The question of Zuhara .—I have been through a great many files on the subject and have consulted confidentially various local people of prominence, without, of course, divulging the reasons for my questions. The conclusions I have arrived at are that it would be distinctly unwise to allow Shikh Isa to occupy Zubara. On the following grounds : — • (a) Shaikh Abdullah bin Jassim of Qatar would strongly* resent the Shaikh of Bahrein again getting a footing on the Qatar peninsula. He is a weaker man and Zubara in the hands of Shaikh Isa would be a pistol at his head always. Shaikh Abdullah bin Jassim would certainly object to the develop ment of a new port on the peninsula of Qatar since it would at once divert all trade from Hohad (Bida) to Zubara and he would not only lose a large amount of revenue at present accruing from the Customs House A1 Dohali, but w ould stand every chance of seeing Dohah entirely disappear as the seaport of Qatar. Ibn Sand similarly would take offence at a revival of the port of Zubara under Shaikh Isa’s jurisdiction for like reasons to ( 6 ) above, as such a port would mean the killing of his new trade centre of O’Jair. It should he noted that the harbour of Zubara is naturaliv much better than that of either Dohah or O’ Jair, and with the Shaikh of Bahrein actually compelling all Bahrein trade to go to the mainland through his port of Zubara, the end of both Abdullah bin Jassim’s and ibn Sand’s ports w r ould be certain and quick. As matters stand a good deal of coolness already exists between Ibn Sand and Shaikh Isa owing to the latter having recently instituted a 5 per cent, tax on goods passing through Bahrain for O’Jair even though such goods never leave the Bahrein Customs House. Ibn Sand contends that Shaikh Isa should only take demurrage charges (or Artkiyeh). In my opinion the suggestion of Shaikh Isa’s that he be allowed to revive a ten'year-old controversy should be nipped in the hud. The new move i&amp; -4 \r 21 obviously an attempt to extend his power territorially and financially at the expense of Ibn Saud and Abdullah bin Jassim and will only end in trouble I urther I consider it is the thin edge of the wedge to Shaikh Isa layino afresh Insclaim to be ruler of the whole peninsula of Qatar, which claim was uennitely I gather quashed some fifteen years ago. I attach a small sketch map to illustrate my remarks regarding Zubara. Regarding point 4. I have no remarks to make.

Wilson, C.S.I., C.M.G., C.I.E., D.S.O., Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. ***** I find the following matters at Bahrein very unsatisfactory and consider we should attempt to rectify them. 1 . I find a considerable feeling of hostility to ourselves due to religious, economical, personal and war reasons, assisted in a negative way by the missionaries. Also there is a considerable party hostile to the Shaikh and consequently to ourselves. In contrast to this I find no British party and a general lack of touch especially with those hostile to ourselves. Proposed remedy ( 1 ) Half-monthly majlis to explain any matter of importance, to act as a vent for public opinion, to hear grievances and to bring the Agent into closer touch with British subjects and Foreigners. 2. More entertaining especially of those hostile or supposedly so ; up to the present these have been excluded from association with the Agency. This I hold to he w r rong policy, as an odd word may give warning of trouble, or a sentence enable an action to be anticipated. 3. The definite formation of a British party by indirect methods, such as rewards, which you have kindly agreed to, by closer association, and by visits, by letters of appreciation from yourself or Mr. Bill, in really deserved instances, through schools, presents and literature. ( 6 ) The extraordinary backwardness of the place considering its long association with ourselves. I propose to improve the water supply’) r. m. i i j • j To get electrical plant. j Ca P ltal alread y P rom;K ' (L . Start the municipality on sound lines ; at present it is only a pretence. Import fruit trees suitable to climate and soil and trees. (c) The ignorance of even the highest classes. School immediately imperative and strong support offered, but must he under control of Political Agent. ' (d) Local industries practically non-existent. I propose to enquire seriously into pearl button machinery, and, if, practicable, to introduce. Also to start small industrial school. As regards ( 6 ), (u) and (d) any amount of capital is available and at present lying idle. (e) The American missionaries. I am not at all satisfied that the American Government is not behind their activities. I will give full details as far as I have gone in report.i i &gt; I view with suspicion their activities at Hasa, especially this latest move for buying dates and starting a date factory there. I would like further enquiries made as to the visit of Tomlinson on 14th-15th April. He came to buy dates for Hill and Company. I have extremely reliable information that he brought comparatively small quantities, but visited important merchants at Najd and received orders for 3 lakhs of cotton cloths. Further the missionaries have entirely ceased to convert, are entertaining largely, are giving presents in great numbers, holding Majlis and are particularly friendly to all those whom I know to be hostile to ourselves. They at the best are neutral in opinions asked by Arabs of rumour in our disfavour. Remedy, If they entertain, I propose to double it; if they hold a Majlis, I propose to do the same. ***** I propose to place an Agent in Hasa for this and other reasons and pos-s sibly in Qatif. Once again the above is only very briefly put, (f) Shaikh Abdulla’s visit will, I hope, be the remedy to many evils in administration and result in peace and progress, and I hope tp make tus visit more one for educational purposes than pleasure, and I hope you will approve my considering this to be the main object of the visit, the education of course being made as pleasant as possible, but that I should constantly bear in mind local requirements rather than sight-seeing as such. (g) The Ikhwan movement .—That through the above progressive proposal^ we should use Bahrein as the place from which wp ipay hope to influence central Arabia and educate it. That the Agent should pay frequent visits to Hasa, Qatif, etc,, and invite the Amirs and some of their officials to Bahrein. That agriculture should be encouraged on the mainland in order to employ these fanatics more profitably. I understand that there are large areas capable of irrigation with the aid of machinery. If this could be accomplished large numbers of Ikhwan might be settled. Bin Saud has constantly broached the subject, and I might make it one of my duties tp get estimates and see types of pumps, etc., at home. We could illustrate their utility and introduce them * at Hasa. I know ho'vy hard up you are for cars, but I would be grateful for a Ford if you can spare one at any time. I think that the Agent should know every village in the Island, every Shaikh and every Amir and cpnstan tly visit them. It is more likely that in the small villages people will talk and give me a fair idea of what is going on in there. In Manama a Ford could go anywhere on the Island and further could be taken to the mainland and possible motor routes explored as far as Hasa on toward Riadh and Koweit. * * * * f Demi-official, dated Bushire, the 17th June 19f9. From—G. H. Bill, Esq., Deputy Political Resident, Bushire, ^ To— 'Lieutenant-Colonel A. T. Wilson, C.I.E., D.S.O., C.M.G., Officiating Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Baghdad. Bray’s demi-official of May 27th raises a large question of principle, which applies not only to Bahrein, or even to Nejd, but to the whole of the territories bordering on the Persian Gulf. It is a question to which I have given much thought, and the issue may be fairly stated as follows:— Hitherto the historic role of the British Government in these waters has been that of keeper of the Maritime Truce. Until very recent times our claims to predominance in the Persian Gulf, though well enough founded on our performances in the role mentioned above, were not really much supported by any exertions of ours in the direction of lighting and buoying, although British statesmen were in the habit of assuming this for public consumption. That has, however, now been remedied ; but the fact remains that Great Britain has 1 been the maritime policeman of the Gulf, and very little more. Is it, or is it not, desirable that we should take a pronou need step further, and assume the responsibility for a gradual education of the Gulf populations on the lines of Western civilisation ?On the Persian Coast We are no doubt slightly handicapped by the claims of the Persian Government to a consideration which is given it by none of its own subjects, and indeed by practically no one but ourselves; but on the Arab side, with the disappearance of the Turks, we have an absolutely free hand, and the time has certainly come for a definite decision on policy. There can be no doubt at all that if we can exclude any future political competitor (there is none in sight at present), and if we simply pursue our present policy of abstention, the coastal Arab of 2019 will be exactly the same as his forefather of to-day, except that he may spend his earnings from pearl- diving in a slightly different way ; he will not move suo motu. It is a very arguable position, which is by no means without attraction to my mind, that he is, though an animal, a fairly happy animal, and that the heady wine of Western civilisation may merely turn him into a discontented decadent. On the other hand, such a policy accords very ill with the present trend of policy in India, and in particular with the sentiments of the Montagu- Chelrnsford Report, and would stand little chance of deliberate adoption, I should think, by the Powers that be, if they were brought face to face with it. In any case, it is desirable to do this; to bring them face to face with it, and make it clear that we can either let the Arab continue to dream out his low life, or we can set ourselves to create in him a divine discontent. In any case, let us know what we are doing. A sordid, hut weighty detail, in favour of the former policy is that the latter is bound to cost a good deal of money, and there is not the remotest chance that anything in the nature of schools or hospitals will be self-supporting in these tracts. It is much mere likely, except, I think, in Bahrein, that any such efforts will be met with a stolid, and solid, opposition, as tending to interfere with cherished institutions, such as the sectarianism of the Wahabi and Omani, and the possession of diving slaves. So much for the question of principle; if we are to let things alone, the enthusiastic local officer, like Bray, must be discouraged, and informed that if devout American citizens like to spend their dollars enlightening the Bahreini, it is no concern of ours, and in any case we are not going to enter into competition with them at Government expense. In the same way we should leave Shaikh Abdul la Bin Jasim of Qatar, and all the petty Shaikhs of the trucial coast, and their subjects, as much alone as we do at present. Assuming, however, that the alternative policy is deliberately accepted with its necessary financial consequences, I sketch below what I conceive might be the lines of development in each sphere. I take Bahrain first, an actually and potentially the most important, and as the subject of Bray’s letter. Setting aside for the moment his projects 'for an active competition with the American missionaries, his proposals for permanent institutions are— \(a) A municipality run “ on sound lines,” i.e., in the present state pf Bahrein, on lines approved by the Agency, the running of the machine being also carefully, if at the same time quietly and tactfully, supervised by the Political Agent. ( 6 ) A school, obviously on the same lines. Prom the standpoint now adopted, these proposals are obviously sound; I would ^o further and say they are indispensable, if the Bahrein is to be raised in the scale of Western civilisation. It is also true that though there will be more people in Bahreini who will welcome these developments than anywhere else, still there will be an actively hostile party, or, if Bray’s estimate of the American activities is correct, even two hostile parties ; that of Islamic conservatism, and that of American propogandism. To mqet these, and create an atmosphere favourable to the new ventures, a good deal of propaganda work will unquestionably be required. I do not at present regard the case against the American Mission as proved ; that is, I do not consider it certain that their attitude, which was first noted and reported by Loch, is not due to local idiosyncracies rather than to the delibe rate policy of their headquarters Poreign’s endorsement No. 543-W., dated 2nd© r&lt; British Residency a Consulate-General, ITo: /Z6 of 1^03.

Sir I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter ITo: 655 dated 3th December 1^07 re garding Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed of Bahrein, now in exile. your communication. Sheikh Mubarek insisted that Sheikh Usa was asserting that he himself was anxious to have his nephew back, but was not allowed to do so by Government or by me. In reply I told Sheikh Mubarek that the question of Sheikh Ali’s return had as a matter of fact been specifically gone into but that it appeared on investigation that Sheikh Usa was un able to offer satisfactory assurances of his ability to keep Sheikh Ali in proper subjection, or adequate guarantees for the latter’s good behaviour. I added that knowing as we did the past antecedents of the uncle and nephew inter se it was more than doubtful whether Sheikh Usa did really desire Sheikh Ali’s return. This was said to him in strict confidence. You may now tell him from me, also in confidence, that the Political Agent has lately been approached 2. On the occasion referred to in paragraph 5 of on f/« ^L{ on the subject by Sheihh Esa and that if such practical proposals are put forward as make it possible to ask Government to reconsider the position, it will be done. You might add that I am always glad to know his (Sheikh Mubarek's ) wishes and feelings on subjects in which we are both interested, and that in the present case, if it proves possible to shape matters in the direction which he advocates, I shall count on his co-operation, if I need it, in exacting such effective guarantees both from uncle and nehpew as will make it quite sure that Sheikh All cannot again give trouble either to Sheikh Isa or our selves.

To The Political Agent, K 0 W E I T. Sir, \ With reference to your letter No. 1-C dated 8th Febru ary 1908 recounting your meeting with one of the Nasir Mubarak branch of the Bahrein family, I have the honour to acquaint you that Nasir Mubarak has repeatedly made overtures for our assistance which has always been refused. I attach copies of the from which you will see that the Government of India do not propose to intervene. I suggest your replying in the sense of paragraph^of ray letter No. 30 dated 21st January 1906 and going on to inform your visitor that by harbouring the outlaw Ahmed bin Selman his family are not going the right way to gain favour with the British Government, and that if their feelings are friendly, the bfest way of showing it is by effecting the arrest and delivery of the pirate.

From—MAJOR P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to Foreign Department letter No. 904-E., dated 7fch May 1903, I have the honour to forward, for the consideration of the Government No. 456, dated 28 rd December 1905 , with of India, copy of a communication Bahrein, which gives cover to a representation from Sheikh Esa’s outlawed received from the Political Agent at i- N/ ‘3^% cousin Nasir bin Mubarak, begging that the British Government will intervene in order to effect a reconciliation between himself and the Ruler of Bahrein. For convenience of perusal I have interpolated among the enclosures of Captain Prideaux’s report copies of Nasir bin Mubarak’s letter to me of 8th &lt;'•' May last and of my letter No. 802, dated 13th June, communicating my instructions to the Political Agent in regard thereto. 2. With such an ensanguined basis as it has, I am inclined to think that the hatred which Sheikh Esa bears towards his cousin is too natural and bitter to admit of reasonable hope that any bond fide reconciliation is possible between the families during the lifetime of the present Ruler; and that it would save us trouble rather to let matters remain as they are than to take action, which if it had the effect of making way for Nasir’s return to Bahrein, would introduce into the principality a probable element of unrest or difficulty which does not now exist. I have little doubt that any overtures from us in this direction would be unpalatable to Sheikh Esa; still more so would be the necessity for suitable pecuniary allowances which would be an inevitable corollary of such intervention. 3. Primarily, therefore, I would be inclined to suggest that we continue to stand aloof, and inform Nasir bin Mubarak that in view of the past, the Government of India do not consider that they have sufficient grounds for intervening in order to press a reconciliation upon Sheikh Esa, but that in saying this they wish in no way to discourage him from making such friendly efforts on his own Jghalf to arrive at a reconciliation with his cousin as may seem good to him. v, ‘ ^ 4. If, however, in view of Nasir’s friendly meeting and peaceable overtures to Captain Prideaux, the Government of India would prefer to adopt a some what more benevolent attitude towards him, I see no great objection to our asking Sheikh Esa if he would be prepared to entertain proposals for reconci liation if made through us. On the whole, however, I am inclined to doubt the practical wisdom of such a course.

The Turkish Government approached me, years ago, with the request that I should sell to them my rights in Bahrein, but that could not be arranged. Afterwards I is the right of Sovereignty in Bahrein. But now since lam assured that Bahrein has come under British protec tion, and I respect British Authority. I have said truce to all thoughts of assailing Bahrein. Sheikh Esa has all this time been appropriating to himself reply:— thought that I should assail Bahrein, and decide by force of arms as to whoseJw 1 V t the revenues of the Island. I submit that he has no right, and especially to usurp my right over half of Bahrein. I now beg to say that since your Government is a Government of Justice, and since I am an injured person, you should do me justice and have me restored to my rights and privileges. Bailing to achieve my object I shall sell all my rights to the Turkish Government. I hope you will kindly favour me with an early reply. No. 802, dated the 13th June 1905. From— Major P. Z.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 189 of 1st June, enclosing translation of a letter from Nasir bin Mubarak.to my address. 2. We can only regard Nasir bin Mubarak as a subject of Sheikh Esa in rebellion, and I think the proper course is to ignore the letter and refuse to hold any communication with the writer except through Sheikh Esa. In fact, I think it would be worth while your telling Sheikh Esa now that you have had a letter from Nasir expressing a desire to communicate with you, and are ignoring it, and adding that you mention the fact to him in case he can suggest any reason for the rebel writing to you now. Presumably Sheikh Esa knows his movements. No. 456, dated Bahrein, the 23rd December 1905. From— Captain F. B.

With reference to correspondence ending with your letter No. 802, dated the 13th of June 1905, on the subject of Nasir bin Mubarak, I have the honour to enclose a copy of the letter * which I at No. 202, dated the 22nd June 1905. a( J^ resse( J Sheikh Esa in aCCOrd- ance with your instructions, and a translation of the Chief’s reply thereto. 2. In the circumstances, I was much embarrassed last month at un expectedly meeting Sheikh Nasir in his father-in-law Sheikh Jasim bin Thani’s camp at Bu Hasa, as my refusal to listen to him would have certainly annoyed my host. I decided therefore to give Sheikh Nasir some good advice, and I am 'lad to be able now to forward a translation of a letter, dated the 6th Shawwal 1323 (the 3rd of December 1905), which the refugee has sent to me on the lines I suggested to him. I told Nasir distinctly that there was little chance of Government’s pressing Sheikh Esa to allow him to return to Bahrein, but that they would undoubtedly be glad to hear of the reconciliation, if it could be effected, and that submission on his part would at any rate perhaps benefit bis descendants after Sheikh Esa’s decease. Sheikh Nasir met Sheikh Hamad in Doha a few weeks previous to this conversation, though I am not certain whether the interview was pre-arranged. 3. Sheikh Nasir is exactly the same age as Sheikh Esa, but looks much stronger and younger. It has‘been our policy always to support Sheikh Esa against Sheikh Nasir after the people had chosen the former for their Chief- Sheikh Esa himself, as well as others, has related to me the story that the Government actually offered Nasir to the people of Bahrein as ruler—but according to his lights Sheikh Nasir seems to honourable life, and I do not think that he is altogether sympathy, At the commencement of our interview the Sheikh told me that he only . asked the British Government to stand neutral, and he would soon capture the islands: he would guarrantee at the same time that no pillaging of private property would occur. I told him that the Goverment had guaranteed the Huler of Bahrein against all external enemies and that they would not consent ever again to see the Government of the islands divided into two. I then an alternative have lived an undeserving ofasked him why he had never taken to pearl-dealing after the example of his father-in-law. On this Sheikh Jasim interposed with the remark that it would not be fitting for a prince to engage in^ commerce ! I have heard the slame remark from lesser lights of the family in Bahrein. 5. On my return to Bahrein I explained to Sheikh Esa the awkward circumstances in which I had been placed and told him that I had not in any way sought the interview. I have said nothing about the receipt of the letter since from Sheikh Nasir as there are so many other more pressing matters under discussion with the Chief.

It is quite the right thing that you propose to do, namely to hold no correspondence with the said person, who is a notorious rebel, and who was the cause of the murder of my father, Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa, in 1286 H. Since that time he has declared himself in open rebellion against us, and has been an outlaw from Bahrein, I have never had any good feeling for him.

I have abandoned all hopes of recovering the heritage of my grandfather, and I submit to tbe decision of the British Government and of the people of Bahrein that there should be only one of the Al Khalifa as ruler of Bahrein. I wish only to reside in Bahrein as a subject of the Chief like the other members of the Al Khalifa. If the British Government will mediate and effect a reconciliation between me and my cousin Sheikh Esa bin AU and will persuade the latter to bestow suitable allowances upon me and my brethren of the Al Abdallah section, I strictly bind myself to abandon all such ways as mav result in mischief. I am not responsible for the events which under God’s will occurred in the past, as I was young and ignorant and a follower of Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdallah. I hope to God that a reconciliation will he effected* between the Al Abdallah and the Al Selman, and that this may he achieved through the efforts of the British Government.

I have the honour to solicit a refer ence to your letter No.955, dated the 24th March 1908 on the subject of the Nasir Mobarafc branch of the family of the Sheikhs of Bahrein. 2. Hearing that Nasir bin Mobarak was in Koureit,I thought it a favourable opportunity to acquaint the family with the reply which you were good enough to authorise me to give to their appli cation. 3 # I accordingly instructed Moolla Abdulla bin Abdul Ilahi to inform Nasir bin Mobarak that, as he was no doubt aware,Ali bin Hauiad had visit ed me a month or two ago and requested me to write to the Resident on behalf of the family, that I had received a reply and would be glad to inform him of it,if he would visit me. 4. On the 12th May, Sheikh Nasir bin Lioba- rak came to see me and, in the course of conver sation showed me a letter that he had received from Captain Prideaux couched in precisely the terms that I had been instructed to convey.I told the Sheikh that this letter simplified matters for me a good deal, as it was exactly the answer which I was instructed to give him. Sir,S.S K I further infomed him that it had come r.n nvv knowlflilffe durinK the visit of Ali bin Hamad and I had. reported to iiovemment that there ./as good reason to believe that the notorious outlaw, Ahmed bin Sulaiman, was living in the tenns of tne Sheikh and that I had been instructed to tell him that he could not give a better proof of the sincerity of his professions of loyalty and attach ment to the British Government than by handing over to them this well mown offender. Sheikh Nasir bin Mobarak made no attempt to deny that he was in touch with Ahmed bin Sulaiman but declared that, situated as he was, he had no power whatever to do such a thing.He stated that,owing to his negotiations with tne Brinish authorities, the allowances that he ana his family had been receiving for some years from tne Turms had been cut oft.,that it wno nitn the greatest difficulty That he was able to keep bac*. his own more immediate adherents from making an effort to get bacK their own or perish in the attempt,as he had nothing to induce them to stay with him, that,however,he felt confident that, if the British Government would sten in between him self and Sheikh Isa and give him something even a small portion of the revenues out of which ne had been kent for 3P years,he was confident that he could control them end others and keep them oirt of mischeif • 7# As regards the possibility of a re conciliation with Sheikh Isa, he said that ne had tried to get both Sheikh Kobaram of Kov/eit and Sheikh Jasim bin Thani of Katar to intervene but both had replied that they could do no thing. He said that he did not want to live in Bahrein but would livo wherever he was directed to do so.I The conversation at the visit of 8 . Sheikh Khazal and Sheikh Liobarok to the -t^ericy on the 13th turned on the affairs of Nasir bin Mobarak and I asked them if it was not possible for i hem to persuade Shaikh Isa to put an end to the scandal of his coutins practically begging from door to door.They.replied that while the^ regretted his behaviour, Shei} h Mobarak indeed expressed himself very strongly^ on the subject, thej saw no w y of intervening effectively as, if Rheikh Isa did not listen to them,they never, for a moment, expected that he would,they would according to Arab ideas of honour havs no option but to enforce his compliance with the Sv.ord, a course of action which was impracticable in every way 7 .At the same time, Rheijdi Kobarak warned me that Nasir bin 1'obarak Iiad asked him 'Lo tell me that he had wandered from Consul to Consul getting no satisfaction from them,that the affairs of the Xl Abdulla were in a desperate state, that he would wait a oounle of months to see if any thing came of his present written application which I have the honour to enclose herewith, and then make a desp/erate attempt to recover what he considers his o.m ty force or lie.I replied that then of course he would die and Sheikh Khazal who appears to nave a more correct notion of relative strengths than Sheikh Mobarak,echoed my words. 9 # Sheikn liobarak than abruptly changed the conversation and, as I considered that I had already rather overstepped the limits of friendly a ivice in a matter that had little or no concern with my office,! made no effort to return to the subject.I have *bhe honour “bo be # Sir, Your c&gt;ke iien’L servant-.

Sir V/ith reference to correspondence ending with your ( letter No*237, dated the 13th hay 1908, regarding Naser bin Mubarek, I have the honour to inform you that the Resident directs that if you have an opportunity you should tell Naser that Sheikh Isa is not willing to be reconciled to him and that the Resident regrets he does not see his way to move further in the matter: Major Cox's advice to him is to live quietly for the rest of his life and he would be very ill-advised to embark on rebellious or piratical course, the evil consequences of which would inevitably recoil on his own head and that of his family. As long as they continue to conduct themselves circumspectly his followers of the A1 Abdulla branch can continue to apply to the Political Agent, Bah rein for his good offices in promoting a reconciliation with Sheikh Isa.

Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to give you the following summary of reports received from various reliable quarters, regarding opinions and counsels emitted by Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait during his recent visit to Bahrain. He is said to have in general preached from the text that &lt;f unity is strength.” The Arabs should be alive to the needs of the day and should combine in working together towards definite aims. At the moment it behoved all Arabs to give their effective support to the new Arab Steamship Company. It is further stated that he strongly counselled Shaikh Esa to resist foreign interference. He should be very careful in the future not to relinquish or com promise any of his rights or powers. He congratulated him on the rising Amara building, and adjured him to keep the landing arrangements in his own hands. He should try to build the pier himself, if necessary, taking a loan from the merchants. Shaikh Esa should take up a strong attitude. The people of Debai had set an example which ought to be imitated. The spirit of Patriotism (watamyya) was a thing worthy of all praise and on it depended the life and death of the Arabs. When in doubt or difficulty, Shaikh Esa could always look to him for sincere and wise advice. Shaikh Mubarak is said to have taken his host to task for not having pro vided himself, on advice previously given, with a Steam Launch. He had, however, I think to content himself with the answer to which Political Agents are so well accustomed “ I shall think over it.” 2 . All this does not call for much comment. The hostility of tone towards British supremacy is unmistakeable ; but it is difficult as yet to predict exactly what practical effect such advice, if acted on, would have. In the questions of the pier and the landing arrangements, it might stimu late Shaikh Esa to make some genuine effort to put his house in order and so to remove justification for foreign interference. On the whole he is more likely to keep to the old path which has been worn by his feet for the last 40 odd years than to break out into activity and expense. As regards his mention of Debai, there is no doubt that the real or imagin ed state of affairs at Debai has for long been much occupying the minds of the Arabs here, who are fain to see in it an augury for the realisation of all their day dreams of independence and dominion.

I have the honour to en close, for the information of the Government of India, copies of the corre spondence noted in the margin. Note on History of Zubara and Claims of Shaikh of Bahrein to Zubara. From the old Residency files I have extracted and precised the follow ing:— In 1766 A1 Khalifa Section of the tribe of Utah emigrants from Nejd migrated from Koweit and settled in Zubara. By 1782 the A1 Khalifa has succeeded in establishing their supremacy over the whole of the Qatar peninsula and in this year attacked the Persian Governor of Bahrein and captured the island. From this year to 1842 there was continued fighting and confusion. In 1842 Shaikh Abdullah of Bahrein quarrelled with his grand nephew, one Mohammad bin Khalifa, and drove him out of Bahrein. Mohammed bin Khalifa went to Qatar and rebuilt the town of Zubara which had been deserted since 1811. In 1847 Shaikh Abdullah, at the invitation of Shaikh ’Isa bin Tarif of the A1 bin Ali, made an abortive attempt to reduce Shaikh Mohamed bin Khalifa and died the following year. Apparently one Shaikh Mohamed bin Thani succeeded Shaikh ’Isa bin Tarif as head of the A1 bin Ali tribe during the next decade, and rose to power in the Qatar peninsula. In 1867 and 1868 a series of raids and counter-raids between Bahrein and El Qatar ensued in which the Resident interfered and deposed the Shaikh of Bah rein Shaikh Mohamed and fined others heavily and Shaikh Ali, his brother, who had commanded the forces of the Shaikh of Bahrein, was installed. Shaikh Mohamed bin Thani in 18b9 signed an agreement with the Resident promising to pay Shaikh of Bahrein 9,000 Krans “ Zakat ” a year, to refer all disputes to the Resident and to maintain with Shaikh Ali bin Khalifa the same relations . which had existed between himself and the former Shaikh of Bahrain. This money was paid for the next two or three years and then discontinued when the Turks established themselves in El Bida. Colonel Pelly decided on the occasion of this settlement that while the Bahrein Chief was acknowledged to possess certain rights of pasturage, etc., on the Qatar coast, he should not be empowered to put to sea to coerce any Qatar port. In 1869 Shaikh Ali was killed and after a short interregnum Shaikh Tsa his eldest son, was made Chief of Bahrein by the British Government. From this date on, the Turks attempted to extend their influence in this part of the Arab Coast.Id 1872 Shaikh ’Isa expressed a wish to re-establish a garrison in Zubara and check the intrigues .of his relative Nasir-bin-Mubarak. Colonel Boss re ported to Government that in his opinion the Chief had not the power to pro tect the tribes residing in Qatar and ha&lt;.i advised him to remain neutral. In 1875 the Government of India definitely warned the Shaikh of Bahrein that the consequences would be upon himself if he became involved in the mainland. To this the Shaikh replied that he submitted to the orders of Government, hut did not consider his lights to Qatar invalid or extinct in consequerce. In 1879 Shaikh Mohamed bin Thani died and Shaikh Jasim bin lhani succeeded. In 1890 Shaikh Jasim intrigued to get a Turkish garrison in Zubara and El Qatar and from then onward for several years negotiations passed between His Majesty’s Government and the Porte to evacuate these Turkish ports. In 1895 a division of the A1 bin Ali under Shaikh Sultan bin Salama fled from Shaikh *lsa to Zubara where they v ere encouraged to settle by Shaikh Jasim under the Turkish flag. A naval expedition went to Zuhaia and a por tion of the A1 bin Ali w ere persuaded to return to Bahrein, the others w ent to Bida. In 190' Shaikh Ahmad bin Thani, w r ho had succeeded Shaikh Jasim, washed to come under the protection of the British Government, but, owing to pressure from the Foreign Oflice and the Ambassador at the Porte, the project of making the arrangement fell through. from— Major H. R. P. Dickson, C.I.E., Politaal Agent, Bahrein, To—The Deputy Political Resident, Bushire. Beference the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad’s So. dated 31st October 19J 9, copy to me * I fear I am not in a very good position to offer criticisms on the three points raised by Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah, as I have only recently taken over charge of political affairs at Bahrein. What view’s I do, therefore, put forward must of necessity be those of one lacking experience in the affairs of the Islands and I trust due allowance will be made for discrepan cies, and possibly false conclusions. Before making any remarks on the three points raised, I should like to make some general observations on the attitude in general of Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali al Khalifah and his sons as they have struck me newly arrived as I have in Bahrein. Prom conversations I have had with both Shaikh ’Isa and his sons on different occasions, I gather that they are rather unnecessarily filled with ideas of their own imporlance. The recent wo? hi talk of the “ Rights of small nations” and President Wilson’s utterances regarding the policy of self-determination, etc., w r ould seem to have had its effect on the mentality of the ruling house in Bahrein. I have since my arrival been frequently reminded by Shaikh Isa that “ Great Britain never interferes in our affairs’*—such pointed phrases as the “ Hakumat al Bahrein’'—the “ Malika of Bahrein ” (the Shaikh’s w r ife) “ Kul Dowdah fi huriatiba,” etc., have become rather common of late. There wmuld appear to be an idea abroad that the hand of His Majesty’s Government in future is going to he much more lightly felt, and that a much larger measure of in dependence than heretofore is to be granted to the Euler of Bahrein and other Arab Eulers. This feeling has been fostered than otherwise I think by the recent amendments to the Order-in-Council regarding the Shaikh’s control! over subjects of neighbouring Arab Slates. I). M.
