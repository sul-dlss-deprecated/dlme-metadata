(E 1797/159/34) No. 35. (158/5/39) 'uary, 1939. My Lord, vVith reference to my telegram No. 15 of the 13th January in which I reported that a call for tenders for three cargo ships of modern construction had been issued hy the Ministry of Finance, I have the honour to inform Your Lordship that according to this notice, persons who wish to obtain a copy of the specifications or other particulars in connexion with this tender are invited to apply, either to the Ministry of Finance or to the financial secretary attached to the Iranian Legation in Berlin. 2. During the past fortnight the Commercial Secretary to this Legation has repeatedly asked the Ministry of Finance for a copy of the specifications in question, without sucess. Yesterday it was pointed out to Mr. Cumberbatch that as no date had been fixed for the presentation of tenders, similarly no date had been fixed for the issue of specifications* reliable source that no effort had as yet been made to prepare a cahier des charges. It appears that there are no expert naval engineers available and that none of the officials in the Ministry of Finance are competent to carry out this v-ork. It was alleged that the call for tenders was published in the press in the hope that a number of foreign naval constructors would submit an offer and specifications on their own initiative. Such offers and specifications received would subsequently serve as models and a guide to the Ministry in drafting what would be referred to as T their own cahier des charges*. -’he Right Honourable / 4 . The Viscount Halifax 3. This morning Mr. Cumberbatch heard from a faiily[1765 ! 4. In view of the enquiry which the Minister for Foreign Affairs had made of me as to the possibilit^^pC^ ^ _iuiu ■mn ■wifiin i r ii w buying suitable ships in England I have asked His Excellency whether this call for tenders cancelled his ■previous enquiry or not. Monsieur A^am was very vague and, I think, had not heard of the call for tenders. He said he thought it might be worth while for British firms to offer ships, if they had anything really suitable. In the meantime, however, he has made no reply to t-he enquirie based on your telegram No. 84 of December 50th, which I addressed to him on the olst December, and it does not look as if the Iranian Government meant serious business. 5 . A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade. I have, etc., (Sd. ) H. J.
