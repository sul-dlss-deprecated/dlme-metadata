The carving of the panel showing a lion attacking an antelope appears to be ancient, although the surface has certainly been cleaned of any traces of paint. The same appears to be true of the scroll design enclosing birds and grapes. The other two scroll designs, however, must have been damaged in antiquity. They have been &ldquo;restored&rdquo; in the twentieth century: one with a clumsily posed human figure and an unconvincing lion&rsquo;s head, the other with a pair of snakes and bird heads. Snakes and partial representations of animals very seldom appeared in Late Antique Egyptian sculpture. However, such &ldquo;renewals&rdquo; as these may have given more adventurous carvers the idea of creating the entirely new sculptures seen elsewhere in this exhibition.<br />", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2009-05-06", "date_added": "2009-05-06 10:07:15", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [{"id": 190, "prefix": "", "name": "Coptic", "suffix": "", "nationality": "", "role": "Culture", "dates": "", "start_year": null, "end_year": null, "date_added": "2009-03-25", "rank": 1}], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [], "related_items": [{"accession_number": "67.176.2", "object_id": 92726}, {"accession_number": "68.3", "object_id": 93584}, {"accession_number": "86.226.27", "object_id": 124816}], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 6863634, "name": "Egypt", "type": "Place made"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "40.302_PS1.jpg", "id": 28775, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/40.302_PS1.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/40.302_PS1.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 96, "height": 60}, {"size": "1", "width": 192, "height": 121}, {"size": "2", "width": 384, "height": 242}, {"size": "3", "width": 768, "height": 485}, {"size": "4", "width": 1536, "height": 971}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/40.302_PS1.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": "Coptic. <em>Lion Attacking an Antelope</em>, 6th century C.E.; modern reworking.
