Briw-ah Consulate-Gene ral y ANTANANARIVO. 28 August, 1946. No. 64 . ( Copy to H.M.Ambassador. Paris) . WEEKLY APPRECIATION (POLITICAL). Sir, I have the honour to send an appreciation of the general political situation for the week ending 26th August, 1946. As already reported in my telegram No. 98, no events other than purely local affrays Between native soldiers, have punctuated the period,superficially calm perhaps, since my arrival and taking-over on August 12th. In one of these affrays, a Body of newly repatriated Malgache conscripts just disemBarked at Tamatave, went Berserk inside a Mosquee causing casualties among Comorlan devotees. In another, local and Senegalese soldiers in the Tananarive garni son, dashed in quarrelsome intoxication, and casualties ensued. 2 # During the week, I paid my first official call on M. de Coppet, High Commissioner and Governor General. The meeting was marked By an atmosphere of extreme cordiality, and indeed friendliness, no douBt partly due to having already met His Excellency during a function at Government House in Dar-es Salaam, and my good fortune in securing two seats on the special 'plane which Brought him Back to Madagascar. Austere and aristocratic, M. de Coppet, descended from one of the oldest French families, is reputed to Be a communist. However he strikes me as an 'Bonnets hornne”, and well disposed towards the British. 3 # The local press gives prominence to the forth coming visit of Monsieur Moutet, French Minister for Colonies, which they interpret as a desire on his part 'to study at first hand the critical situation for which one cannot deny he has some responsibility. ' 4. Special attention is given to the Indian Community, convenient scapegoats for the Administration's failure to remedy shortage of manufactured goods. Capitalising a recent incident in which a party of 'Black Market' Indians were caught in 'flagrante delicto' the Conmunist paper 'En Action' asks'if it is not time that Madagascar were rid of these 'Bandits', who Before long will Be the cause^of troubles similar to those experienced in South Africa. Another paper evidences interest in South Africa's problems with the Indian, and there are signs that the Administration here are concerned with the rapid growth of their communities. , 5 This review cannot pretend to Be either profound or exhaustive. During these first 2 weeks, my activities have Been confined to routine and courtesy calls. While it remains true that on the surface the situation has remained quiet, it is also necessary to recognise that no steps have Been taken By the Administration in recent weeks to improve local conditions or remove an£ grievances. A state of tenaion nay Be said to continue. I have the honour to Be, With the highest respect. Sir, 'v. Your most obedient, humble Servant, / T 5 * 7 H. M.Principal Secretary of State (Sgd.)
