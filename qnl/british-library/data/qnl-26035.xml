Sir Arthur arrived at the 'beginning of December but he is now resigning after holding the post for three months. I enclose copies of his letter of resignation, and of my reply. He has had many difficulties to contend .with, some inherent in the character of the Persian or the existence of a state of war, some resulting from his seniority. It is true that at least one matter of major importance which might have been considered within the province of the Board was settled over the Board’s head. The Soviet High Command withdrew from the Soviet army in Persia a thousand lorries for use with the army in Russia and to enable Iransovtrans to hire local transport to replace them the American Lease/Lend representative, Mr. Kidd, in collaboration with our military authorities, issued a considerable number of tyres to Iransovtrans, without waiting for a decision of the Board. Mr. Kidd’s argument w r as that Iransovtrans h^d to carry Aid-to-Russia which had formerly been carried by Russian military vehicles, that this was a military question, and that therefore whatever the Road Transport Board said, the tyres must be given. On this point I have a good deal of sympathy wdth Sir A. Parsons. As to the organisation of the Board: while the British and American members have to suffer delay and waste of time owing to the fact that the President and the Secretary ere Persians, I believe that efficiency could have been increased without making a frontal attack on the Persian Government. In practice the business of the Board is carried on in English, the moving spirits of the Board being the tw r o American members - Mr. Kidd and a Secretary of the American Legation - and thf British member. I offered to supply an English archivist with a knowledge of French and Russian (the Russian member never turns up, but he might) and so to have records kept in English and the Persian secretary bye-passed for urgent correspondence. To secure official Persian recognition for any such arrangement would not have been possible, but I believed, and believe, that if the Board wished to have an alternative to the present Persian lack of system, this was worth trying. Sir A. Parsons, however, did not agree: he may have been right. Sir A. Parson’s suggestion that he should be replaced by someone from the commercial (or MESC) side, is sound. Any such officer would have a background of local knowledge which Sir A. Parsons could only have acquired through working in one of those offices. Gumberbatch will probably take on the job himself. The Americans want him to do so. I am sorry that the arrangement has not been found satisfactory. A man of Sir A. Parson’s position and experience was bound to chafe a good deal at the inefficiency of the Persians and the difficulty of working with Americans and Russians as well. On the other hand he showed great dignity and good humour when the Americans first proposed that he should be Vice-President of the Board and then withdrew/ C.W. Baxter, Esq., G.M.G., M.G THE FOREIGN OFFICE. ’■ -dj ^ 11943 9 ] )FF1CEwithdrew the proposal rather as though he had heen trying to shove himself forward. This was some time ago and has nothing to do with the resignation. I am sending copies of this letter to Garoe in New Delhi and to the Minister of State. * ~~ Yours sincerely, (signed) R. Bullard.Copy. (E 1367/36/54). No.600/2/43 . PERSONAL. I am sorry to receive your resignation, but not surprised, as it had become quite ^ clear that the Transport Board, given the limitations imposed upon it by its composition, gave no scope for a man of your talents and record. When the formation of the Board was first contemplated, it was impossible to foresee what form it would take and what work it would involve, but in the belief that it might be a full-time job for the British member, we eagerly grasped at the offer of your services which the Government of India made us at that moment. I am sorry that the expectation was not fulfilled, and particularly sorry if the experience has been unsatisfactory for you. I am personally very grateful to you for taking on the job and for keeping at it so long, and I hope that when you get back to India you will find something to do which will give you greater satisfaction.

As you know, I have made proposals on more than one occasion for changes in the constitution and procedure of the Board that I thought would make for efficiency, hut for one reason or another they did not meet with favour, and the Board proceeds on the old lines. Apart from that there appears to me a tendency to ignore the Board, and in more than one matter of major importance directly affecting its responsibilities, decisions have been taken without its consultation. I so find myself with work of no great importance that does not on the average exceed half an hour a day, and I am unv/illing to continue to serve in such conditions. If, however, one of the officers of the Gomnercial Secretariat were appointed in my place, it clearly w r ould not add appreciably to his work, and, as I am fully conscious, his greater acquaintance with local conditions and methods and his closer touch with the whole of the Legation would be likely to lead to more satisfactory results. I presume that His Majesty’s Government will bear the cost of the return journey of myself and driver to Delhi. It would have been some convenience to me to use my car all the way, but I realise that you will w f ish to retain it in this country and I only ask that I may use it up to railhead at Zahidan, and there hand it over to the Consul. And, if you will permit me, before I go I should like to make a short tour in Mazanderan, paying the runningexpenses myself.

As this car Is to remain government property, I assume that maintenance charges will be paid by His Majesty’s Government. In this connection Sir Arthur Parsons brought with him. from India'spare parts, including 5 tyres and tubas, to the total value of Rupees 722/7A (equivalent in sterling to £55.11*4). These items, if bought locally in Persia, would have cost many tines as much, so these purchases will save His Majesty’s Government money in the long run. I have accordingly refunded to Sir Arthur Parsons the above sum, and I request your sanction for this Daymen t . 3. Similarly, the car, being government property, should have a chauffeur to ensure proper care and maintenance. An Indian chauffeur has been brought from India by &gt;ir Arthur Parsons and I propose, subject to your covering sanction, to pay him at the rate of Rials 1200 per month, which is an average end adequate remuneration.
