Bait a3 Falaj m i- 1 7tB August 3 914. Dear Col.Bemij Re yesterday’s at'fair,! think I had Better first give you an account of what actually occurred of which 1 think I can how he fairly certain: at the time yesterday, when we were chasing about,I was under different impression, as we had to act very quickly and I had not time to examine into everything: this is what happened:- About 11 a.m. the N.0.0.in charge No.l piquet saw a dhow come to shore on the beach half right i.e.N.l/V. ,of his piquet, close to the hills 11.of Kurram village: the proper order for the piquet is to report anything they may see hap- -pening connected with boats,not to send men down to the boats to see who they are: however this N.0.0.had had the order ^when he took over the piquet to send men down: I may say that before this,about 10 a.m, the dhobi’s chokra had gone down to this same beach to get shells by himself.He told the piquet commander so when he passed:the lance naik put 2 men on a hill at what must have been 1600 or 1700 yards from the dhow and went on by himself .He found the dhow to be engaged in the peaceful pursuit of carting stone from a quarry there is about xx&amp;h mile E. of Kurram and started back with the chokra ,whom he had met on the beach: now to shift the scene a bit: the head man of Wataya whose name I have forgotten,was out with 4 of his men grazing camels: they were close under the hills E.of Kurram the far side of the plain which is to the right front of Ho.l piquet,which latter is on Akabat Wataiya: he,the head man,had seen 3 Arabs,of what he considered suspicious appearance going W along the shore,on foot: as camels have been stolen from Wataiya before now (since we have been here this has happened to my knowledge)ke kept an eye on them: they presently turned inland a bit and stjjjod or sat about: by this time the lance naik and the chokra were also returning and were about in line with the two parties i.e.the Wataiya people ana theg suspicious Arabs,much. Closer bo the latter than the for- -mer: the ^ataiya man had not,he says,se0n any sepoys: to drive off the ’3 men he started shooting at them or towards them,I don’t suppose with much aim:the 3 men then also started firing at the nearest thing they saw,which happened to be the chokra and lance naik: these two latter,when the firing started,had begun running towards tkEss the piquet and incidentally the hill on which the 2 sepoys wexe • the chokra was hit almost at once in the back of the leg and his femoral artery cut: bvatsoh says he was probably dead in 2 minutes: the lance naik was a bit ahead when bhej^ boy was hit and when the latter called out burned back and went to him and was at once hit himself in the right wrist ^ a slight wound,before he had time to lie down beside the chokra: he lay down and got off one round and then his magazine got full of blood and his bolt jammed and he couln’t work it: the bullets from both parties Wataiya and badmashes were falling all round: the chokra was apparently dead: he accordingly retired: one of the sepoys on the hill was firing at both parties,Wataiya and the other,naturally thinking the former also: he got of 10 rounds but I am sorry he didn’t hit anything: the other man was too low down apparently to see and didn’t fire: the nfhso? lance naik got up to them and they went back to the piquet: the 3 badmashes were making off towards the Kurram hills and got into them: this is coxroborated by both the Wataiya head man and the piquet: they apparently did not go on. the Kurram road but K of it into the hills,which seems to me important as showing that they were not Kurram men,but of course they might be: the Wataiya people were too far off to recognise anyone: they,the Wataiya people,who had been reinforced by some 2 or 3 more men from their village, collected their camels and were also making for home,our piquet/ still naturally thinking they were hut too far tobire: the ‘lance naik and 2 privates S°t backt/O the piquet and we got a report in here about 11.45 that 6 or 8 dushiaan ha/1 wounded a lance naih and the chokr a &gt; .having ii rst disembarked from a boat .and were now making off’: I didn f t know what this might portend,so turned out my double company and the machine guns and we got going towards Ho.1piquet by about 12 noon:: Coates V * « * * -*- -* - • V - had gone on first and when I got up to him the. last of the ‘Wataiya men was just disappearing behind a hihl going towards TA/ataiya: so we sent off to get in the chokr4/ s body and sent a party round to exit off any retreat from Wataiya S by the Wadi Adai,and shoved another party up on the hill mile due E of Wataiya,while the rest of us shoved on in the hopes of finding our friends in Wataiya and surrounding it: Coates took about 5 sections round to band retreat H and W and I stopped to give him time to get well on then intending to go straight on x&amp;fe into the village : I also sent the Munshi in to bring out the headman or find out from him anything he could: we had very little hope that we should catch any one,as they had a good start and the going is frightfully heavy and hot: the Munshi soon came back with the- head man and I soon saw we were after the wrong people,so I sent to Coates to go through Wataiya back by Ho.2 piquet,in case he might find any one suspicious and I and Liston with 3 sections decided to be at the plain H of where we were ( i.e.the plain where the affair had started)in the faint hope that we might put up one or more of the 'badmash' lot,who might be taking cover: we accordingly did so, covering about 500 yards of front and with orders to shoot at any one armed who ran away or seemed suspicious: we started H and got close up to a place marked Masaih in the big map about J mile E of Kurram when we thought we had got Bom one,an individual who looked as if he had a rifle and was going along the path towards' Kurram: we took steps to round him up and he turned out a harm! ess _ individual with a stick,but there was nearly a regrefable &lt;incident lieneitlie left section topped a, nise and. sstw a lot of men in front t or 4 hundred Ifyards away who na— -turally started running about on seeing the sepoys: they were as a matter of fact,the worhers at the stone quarry before mentioned: a naik and a sepoy were out for blood and didn f t^i^. notice they weren’t ar$jed and started shooting at them,got off 5 rounds before I could stop them: hit no one: they say they shot in front ( of them to turn them back from running aw ay, but I 1 : anyway the quarry men soon calmed down but could give us no useful information:at this time I was still asking for men who had got out of a boat and done the shooting: if I had known what I found out afterwards I might have gone on to Kurram to have a look round there: from here we beat back E along the plain with ho result: I sent one party back by Darsait in mm case I could get any news from there,which I didn’t and the rest of us went back by ilo.l piquet,the men very cooked* When I fntervemed interviewed the Wataiya head man in the middle of the operations,! understood him to saj^ that his people had not fired at all,but when I enquired further at the piquet on the way back,! found that they undoubtedly had fired,so sent for him this morning to enquire into the reason: he said at once,this morning, that his people started the firing at the 3' badmashes by his order: I don’t suppose he had seen the lance naik as khaki blends very well with the sand and he was a long way off: ! think undoubtedly if he had not fired the chokra would be alive now.It is interesting to note that both the chokra and the 1 ance naik were hit by small bore bullets: there is no doubt of this: the Wataiya man says all his people have Martini Henrys and ho # 303s etc. he did not know ktexpsiapdsxtexs why I asked him: I think the Sultan might order in the head man of Kurram to find out if he knows anything,or I could go % in a day or two and round him up myself: it might bea, good thing to dolay a hit in case any one who may have hhagoed from the village might come hack: the Wataiya man sticks to it that they were after his camels and were pro- -hahly from a long ,way off: the names of the men concerned are:- Naik Nanu Singh a.l.naik Daula Ram private Jiwan Ram ,, Tekchand Ram all of A company. I tell you this in case the 0.0.knows any of them and it would interest him to know their names: the lance naik had a narrow squeak of having 2 arteries cut, and apparently no nerves or tendons are injured. Yours sincerely(9 ^ ar P.A.' In addition t/O 'the t&lt;wo or three 'things which I conveyed 'to you verbally at 8.30 p.m. yesterday H.H.also desired me to mention that the Yvali of Matrah saw H.H.the other day and said that the out- -going Arabs who pass through Bait al Pal aj and Rui are now-a-days not being well examined.People are let go by the ordinary and even other unusual routes without being challenged or stopped and examined contrary to what was done in the time of Col .Edwardes. H.H.said you might like to mention this to the present G.C.with a view to the men on the out-posts or piquets being warned to be more careful(strict). It may be mentioned that I said that the little relaxation,if any,is probably due to Lyud Nadir’s clearly expressed wishes that out-going people may not be subjected to a very strict scrutiny. You will remember that this was conveyed to Captain May some time bach. (sd) S.H. 39-8-34. O.C.Bait al Palaj warned.

Benn, C.I.E., Political Agent and Hi 8 Britannic Majesty J s Consul, Maskat, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of my letter No. 199, dated the 22 nd August 1914, which I have addressed to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. From— Lieutenant-Colonel R. A. E. Benn, C.I.E., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat, To— Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to report the following incident for your information. 2. On the morning of the 16th August, the Officer Commanding Bait al Falaj reported by telegram that the regimental dhobi's son had been shot dead and a Lance Naik of the regiment wounded by a party of “ budmashes ” in the hills to the north-west of one of the outlying picquets at Bait al Palaj. As soon as the news reached Headquarters, the troops were turned out to scour the hills with, however, no result. 3. The following is an abreviated account of the affair as given by the Officer Commanding Troops :— The non-commissioned officer of No. 1 Picquet had seen a boat land some men on the beach within sight of their post. He despatched a Lance Naik and two men to ascertain who they were. They proved to be harmless people, who had come to get stone from a quarry hard by. The dhobi’s son had preceded the party to the beach for the purpose of collecting shells. He returned with the Lance Naik. Elsewhere in the vicinity the headman of the Wathaiya village (3 miles from Bait al Palaj) was out grazing his camels. He saw in the distance what he considered to be a party of “ budmashes ” and as the neighbourhood is a favourite haunt of thieves and several instances of camel stealing having occurred, the headman proceeded to fire on the “ budmashes ” at long range. The “ budmashes ” not seeing where the firing had come from, promptly returned it aiming at the nearest object they could see moving in their vicinity. This happened to be the Lance Naik and the dhobi’s son who were about 400 yards distant. The dhobi’s son was hit in the thio-h and his femoral artery was severed. He died almost at once. The Lance Naik was wounded in the wrist, but was able to let off one round after which his magazine jammed with his blood. The “budmashes” are said to have disappeared into the hills in the direction of the Kurram village. No trace of them was found in the neighbourhood, though a search was made for several hours by the troops. The Officer Commanding attaches no blame to the Watbaiya people. 4. This incident occurring at a moment wffien strong rumours are current locally of the rebels’ intention to renew their hostilities on Maskat and Matrah after the Id at once gave colour to the above reports and some local excite ment resulted in the town. 5. As a result of enquiries which His Highness has made, it seems that the “ budmashes ” were a portion of a gang of Bani Battash who h tve recently been harassing the neighbourhood of Karyat. They direct their operations from the village of Hail to the south-west of Karyat and have already killed four Baluchis of the Karyat village. Their practice is to snipe at any one they see on the outskirts ot the village. British subjects have been refused permission to return to Karyat which place they vacated before the bombard ment of the town by H. M. S. “ Dartmouth” in April last. Enclosure, No. 199, dated Maskat, the 22nd August 1914.2 His Highness has informed me that his information shows that a party of Bani Battash recently left Hail for the Wadi Hatat. From there they detached a smaller party to the hills round Wathaiya with instructions to loot camels and snipe at any “friends of the Sultan His Highness thinks that the '* budmashes } * who fired on the Lance Naik and killed the dhobi’s son were members of this gang. He also informs me that he has heard that it is the intention of Bani Battash to harass the Bait al Falaj post after the Id and that their attention will then be specially directed to the Ruwi post. The Officer Commanding at Bait al Falaj has been warned and has made his arrangements accordingly. 6. A copy of this report is being posted to the Hon’ble the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. )hat a party i there they ions to loot ;s thinks that bi’s son were ion of Bani 3ir attention d has made Secretary to &amp; (f Mascat^ 21&amp;t August /l4 My deer fay, Fros? informiMmi vdiieh the SuXt.xa has been abjfee to coll ect it pretty certain chat ohe badmashes who were out on the 16th.were men of the Beni Battash tribe.

The remainder/ of the picket including the H.C.O.in command, who,contrary to all orders,were sleeping outside the morcha and between the latter and the wire entanglement above described, all fled in a panic,abandoning 4 rifles and all their accoutre- Jients f and some ammunition* On© sepoy appears to have fired on© round MM 2MgM* at the raiders without effect. He then lifted the wounded sepoy and carried him into safety. The ; • ; ; ' ' w \\ •* Interpreter was left for dead where he fell* The enemy after firing one volley rushed right through the post and hid themselves close fcy. Then,finding the post had been abandoned, they returned and took off the rifles and other booty in the presence of the Interpreter who feigned death. Almost simultaneously with the attack on the Examining Post,3 shots were fired at Mo* 3 Picket a short distance away* This fire was returned by the Picket and the enemy decamped. It is estimated that the gang consisted of 8 men,of whom 5 attacked the Buwi Post and three the He.3 Picket.
