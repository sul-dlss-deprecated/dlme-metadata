THE PERSIAN SITUATION ] . 1 he Indian aspect of the Persian question can he very briefly stated. Persia lies across the most vulnerable flank of our Indian position, and the defence of India must always be the governing consideration in our Persian policy. So long as we hold India, we cannot afford to disinterest ourselves in the affairs oi her western neighbour. II Persia were a well-organised State under a stable administration, we might be content to take a merely passive interest in her affairs. Unfortunately, the reverse is the case. Persia, as a body ^politic, is in the last stages of decay and decomposition. The Government at i.ehrun is hopelessly weak and ineflieient. ( abinets succeed one another in rapid succession, but little serious attempt is ever made to remedy the confusion in public affairs. The Shah’s writ scarcely runs beyond the capital itself, and even there the Government has little real authority over the faction of irresponsible “ democrats,” who control what passes for public opinion, and resort, when necessary, to assassination as a means of achieving their purpose. It was only by foreign assistance that even a semblance of tranquillity was maintained in the interior before the war. No practical means existed of protecting the external frontiers of the country against hostile attack. -• I be presence of such a neighbour, inconvenient at all times, lias since the outbreak of Avar constituted a grave menace to our interests. Of the nature of German designs against India it is unnecessary to speak in detail. Their general character and wide ramifications are matters, not of surmise, but of ascertained fact. \\ ith headquarters at Berlin, where Avell- known Indian seditionists were pressed into the service, the organisation extended to the United States'; Mexico, China, Japan, and the Dutch East Indies. Persia, from her geographical position, offered a promising held for enemy activities, and has in fact figured prominently in the campaign. We have detailed information, derived from captured diaries, &lt;kc., of the various enemy parties that have used the country as a base for anti-British agitation in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Some of these parties, as is well known, succeeded in reaching Kabul, where, (luring a prolonged stay, they pressed the Amir with all the arts of persuasion to take his stand as a ‘ l King of Islam ’ and join in the Holy War against the infidel. Turkish agents even penetrated into the independent tribal country on the North-West frontier of India. Fortunately for us the Amir, despite strong pressure from influential sections of his own people, relused to be drawn from the path of neutrality. As time went on. the situation in Persia improved. The routes leading into Afghanistan Avere blocked by British and Russian troops; and the Germans at Kabul, finding themselves isolated and discredited, and realising the failure of their mission, Avere reduced to seeking means of escape. The British occupation of Baghdad in March 1917 appeared to have finally redressed the balance in the Fast in our favour. 3. But the Russian revolution has upset all calculations. Russia, on whom avc relied to control the situation in North and North A Vest Persia in our joint interests, has not only ceased io he an effective ally, but has become a potential enemy of a particularly dangerous kind. Not only have her troops melted away, leaving north Persia open to the enemy, but she herself has developed internal disorders that may well prove more dangei'ous to us, if the contagion, is allowed to spread, than the most actWe propaganda of the Germans and Turks. 'There can be no illusions about the policy of the Russian Bolshevists in relation to India. 'The British Charge d’Affaires at Petrograd has recently Avarned us that they mean mischief there; and we have further direct evidence in the proclamation, issued at Petrograd some weeks ago, which called upon the people of India to eject the British as a necessary preliminary to “self-determination” on Bolshevist lines. Germany may lie trusted to avail herself of this new weapon for striking at British interests; and Persia, Avitli, her northern frontiers open, again S 1 W 3 INoffers a favourable line of attack. The confusion raging in the a Ijoinin-.- Russian districts cannot but aid the enemy in his designs. We know tint German and Austrian agents arc already at work in the Caucasus whiG Turkish (and perhaps German) officers have arrived at Resht am’ are co-operating with the rebel Jangali tribesmen in the Persian province of Gilan. General Dunstervilie’s recent experiences show how desperate ihe conditions in North-West Persia have become. 1. The dangers of the situation will be readily appreciated. It mav be quite true, as is understood to be the opinion of the General Staff, that no organised military attack is to be apprehended. But, so long as the frontier remains open, there is nothing to prevent the influx into Persia of hostile emissaries of every description—Pan-Turanian agents, missionaries of Jihad apostles of Bolshevism, or enemy prisoners of war (of whom there must be large numbers, under very inadequate restraint, in Asiatic Russia) prepared to organise bands of local brigands and to throw the whole of Northern Persia into a ferment which cannot fail to react upon the sitmition in Afghanistan and beyond. One consequence of these activities, if tinware allowed to proceed unchecked, may be that our Legation will be compelled to withdraw from ‘Tehran just as our Consulates had to withdraw from &lt;Central Persia (Kerman, Ispahan and Shiraz) in 1915. Such an event wmuld be a severe blow to our prestige throughout the East, and its effect at Kabul might well be disastrous. Hostile influences, never more than dormant in Afghanistan, would be revived and strengthened, and the Amir with such an object lesson of our impotence before his eyes, might find his present position no longer tenable and definitely throw in his lot with the enemy. 5. For all these reasons it appears to the India Office that our military cordon along the Eastern borders of Persia will not prove sufficient to safeguard the interests of India; and that, despite the difficulties involved, some attempt should be made to close the door in the North west, which the defection oi Russia has left open. It is not pretended that, even if this object were achieved, our defensive system would be com plete. Ihe 1 rans-Caspian provinces of Russia would still afford the eneinv access to the northern frontiers of Persia and Afghanistan by routes which no British cordon whether in Eastern or North-Western Persia, could control, hi bybarrmgthe main avenue of approach, and restricting hostile intrusion to difficult and circuitous bye-paths, we shall have gone far towards rendering our position secure. ^ ■ , V- the , T lditions 0f l ’ ersia co^'espotided iu fact to her position in CUr C0urse ' vo ] u ! d a sim P le &lt;&gt;ue.

In return for their acceptance of our assistance, and for the establishment of an effective cordon between the Caspian and the right flank of our position in Mesopo tamia, we should be ready to withdraw all our regular troops (other than Consular guards) from the interior of Persia. The question of attaching British omcers to the J ersian Cossack Brigade might he raised in the same connection, bir G. Marling, it is true, lias stated that such a proposal would never be entertained by the Persian Government. But until it has actually been put to them, it seems premature to abandon the suggestion in advance, or to assume that there is no hope of its acceptance if urged tactfully upou the Persian Government as part of a scheme of tranquillisation framed in a large measure in the interests of Persia itself. If further inducements are needed they might take the familiar form of increased financial assistance. 8. In conclusion, it should be clearly understood that the measures in contemplation do not include anything in the nature of elaborate military operations in North-West Persia. Apart altogether from political objections, it is recognised that the troops required lor such a purpose are not available. \\ hat is suggested is that a fleet of armoured motor-cars, under the charge of British ofiicers and non-commissioned officers of General Dunsterville’s party, should be established at the southern end of the Kasr-i-Shirin- Kermanshah-Hamadan road, and should gradually extend its operations northwards in the direction'of the Caspian as circumstances permit. The British officers in charge would have authority to organise local levies, Ac., as opportunity offered, or to take over existing organisations (e.g., the Cossack Brigade) to assist them in their work. It is believed that, given the right quality of officer and the necessary financial support, the objects in view could be achieved without further assistance from regular troops. The General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, would not be required to do more than extend his right flank up to the Eastern end of the passes leading from Irak into Persia. These passes, it may be observed, will be clear of snow and open to traffic*in about a month’s time. Political Department, India Office, 24th February 1918. J. E.

The report, written by John Evelyn Shuckburgh, Secretary to the Political Department, India Office, begins by stressing the importance of Britain taking an active interest in affairs in Persia, since events there may have an impact on Britain's position in India.Shuckburgh opines that Persia, as a body politic, is in the last stages of decay and decomposition, and he describes how the country has been used as a base for anti-British agitation in Afghanistan and elsewhere.Whilst noting that the British occupation of Baghdad in March 1917 appeared to redress the balance of power in the East in Britain's favour, Shuckburgh argues that the Russian revolution has upset all calculations; he remarks that Russia has ceased to be an effective ally against German and Turkish threats to Britain's presence in Persia and may in fact become a potential enemy.Shuckburgh suggests that Britain requests that the Persian Government takes steps to protect the North-West frontier of Persia (with an offer of British military assistance), whilst making it clear that if prompt and effective action does not appear to be forthcoming then Britain will take certain measures in accordance with its own interests in the East.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Secretary to the Political and Secret Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Military strategy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00016a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
