Moorthy had to proceed on leave at short notice. I had actually earmarked Mohammed Ashroff II, who^you knew in Muscat, to relieve Moorthy subject to his stenography having improved sufficiently. I cannot yet say that Mohammed Ashroff II is really a good stenographer 'but he tells me he has improved since he was in Muscat. He is, however, a more experienced clerk than Brinilfe.san. 3. I should 'be grateful if you would kindly let me know whether you would prefer to have Mohammed Ashroff II in place of briniVasan. If you would, he will 'be posted to Bahrain and SriniVasan will return to'Bushire. In order to avoid delay you might telegraph your reply. 4. I am anxious to put noorthy into the Treasury at Bushire so that he can gain some practical experience in \ accounts works at the earliest possible date. He now has seven years service all of which has 'been spent as a copyist or stenographer. 2 Srinitflasan was sent to Bahrain as a stop-gap when J. Pelly, Esquire, O.BJS., Political Agent, Bahrain. .
