Dear Sir, With a view to safeguarding our aircraft against sudden storms, a protected shelter on the lines of the drawing enclosed herewith, has been suggested by our Head Office. Being composed of mud you will readily appreciate that it would be of an enormous weight and one would have to consider whether the ground would be suitable to withstand this. I wonder if it would be possible for you to give us some idea of what such a structure would cost at Kuwait, where it would only be necessary for one half of this to be erected as that shown on the drawing is for two aircraft. .Yours faithfully, p.p. IMPERIAL AIRWAYS LIMITED. Manager, No.2. Operating Division. Lieut. Colonel H. R. Dickson Political Agent, KUWAIT.Specification of Sun-dried Brick Hangar It is intended that this should be built of local Smutty 1 , and as this is an entirely new departure it is considered that the walls, to carry a height of 30 ft., should have a base of 12 ft # tapering to 3 ft. at the top. It is intended that the aircraft shall taxi as near to the enclosure as possible, turning with the tail to the enclosure, and that a hand-winch capable of towing the machine shall be fitted behind the rear wall of the shelter in order to permit the aircraft to be dragged in on its own wheels. A form of pulleys can be devised so that the winch can operate a machine in the enclosure at right- angles to it. It will thus be seen that it will be necessary to have a small apperture passing through the back wall of each enclosure. The following are roughly assessed figures of the quantities for two of these shelters. Eleven 53 ft. walls; 30 ft. high; base 12 ft. tapering to 3 ft. at the top:- Total length of walling 679 ft. This estimated to require 2,843 tons of mud.

I regret that I was unable to write to you earlier owing to my absence in Shiraz on recess. My Office, has, however, been actively pursuing the matter during my absence and now reports that no suitable quotation has come forth, the lowest so far received being Ks. 5,460 for a total length of 318’ walling of a thickness of Q 1 at the base. The length of 318* feet, as you will see covers only one 'Shed'. The above figure is no doubt excessive, but it is hoped that the contractors will be in a position to quote suitable figures after about 10 days time, when due to the return of divers from the pearling banks, the cost of labour will go down considerably.

My dear Fowle , I am writing to ask whether you could do anything for us, by means of a private or unofficial communication to those who manage things in London, in the matter of the very irregular calls which Imperial airways are more anc more inclined to treat Kuwait tfith nowadays. 2. i*e are supposed to get two air mails a week in westward, and two in eastward direction, thougt the Company reserve themselves the right to fly over Kuwait should they be running late, or should tley be doing a night flight, or if fog or other natural phenomena made it dangerous for them to land. 3. These reservations are quite legitimate, and we do not complain at all, if they are every now and then enforced. 4 # hat we find bard to stomach, is the practice pilots make of flying over Kuwait (growing more and more frequent of late) when they are right up to time, and when the weather con ditions are absolutely perfect. 5 . Not only does this failure to stop greatly disappoint ^ those who expect air mail letters from England and America (not to mention Baghdad and Basra) but it has compelled most of air us Europeans in Kuwait to give up trying to post our/mail letters in Kuwait. Instead we send our letters 2 days before thf air mail is due by ordinary post to Basra ana arrange for them to be put in the Air Mail Bag there. This naturally loses us any advantage that we could get from our air mail service. Q m The worst feature of these continued failures to call on the part of pilots is the fact that, telegrams informing us that they intend flying over are nearly always received after the machine has passed Kuwait. This is most disheartening The Hon’ble Lt.-Colonel T.C.Fowle,C.B.S., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIRK.disheartening for the Agent, the quarantine Officer, and the refuelling staff, who over and over again go to the aerodrom lay out all their petrol tins, fire extinguishers, pumps etc. (in the case of refuelling staff) sit for a couple of hours or so and then have the mortification of seeing the aircraft high over and getting the telegram that it intended doint so all along• 7. bimilarly if the aircraft is arriving say three hours after schedule and intends to land, the staff which meeti the machine get no proper warning of this late running. Thus they are kept waiting for as much as 4 hours on the aerodrome not knowing if the machine is coming, is going to land, or is going to fly over, a belated telegram is usually delivered when the machine arrives. q # The whole thing resolves itself in one of ’’staff work' as far as I can see, ani 1 would make the following suggestions for bettering the state of affairs, which I trust you will see your way to pass on to London;- (a) The Company should give Kuwait definitely one Sastbound and one Westbound service a week, however late it is running, and fix the days on which these may be to be expected. One such regular air mail in either direction per week will be far more satisfactory from our point of view than two uncertain mails, both of which we may fail to catch under present circumstances. The second weekly service can either be withdrawn, or left in its present uncertain st a t e. (b) If aircraft are running late, say from India, it should be a comparatively easy matter for the pilot to send intimation of the fact from KARACHI. At least he could wire the day he was due to arrive, or whether he was going to make a night flight over Kuwait. At present if he intends ilying over, for3 - for instance, he sends his telegram from Bahra: which invariably gets to Kuwait, after the macl has passed, and after the staff have waited on ground for several hours, expecting her to land. (c)Similar messages could easily be sent from Eaghc by the pilot on arrival at the airport there . and not as he now does from Ehaiba, a point only 75 miles away. The Company’s pilots must always, X realize, hav the last word, but what one would like to see from them is a little more thought for their frieno s on the ground. Ve here do a lot for them, which they know nothing of, and I do not think it is asking too much, that a little consideration be shown us in return. Too often does one get the impression especially when the weather is perfect and the aircraft has flown over, even vtiien up to time, that the-pilot makes his decision purely according to the whim of the moment or the state of mind he happens to be in. This should not be. 10. ?or your information, I attach a statement with dates of Sast and rVestbound planes which were due to land and which landed , also those due to land, which did not land , covering a period from 1st April Bj 35 to 30th Kovember 1935 (i.e. ei^it months). From this it will be seen that the Westbound ser/ice landed on an average 5 times per month and failed to land 3.75 times, while Jastbound service landed 5.12 times p.m. and failed to land 3062 times. 11. I trust you will do your best to represent our case to the authorities concerned.

Dickson, ns you will see from his paragraph 3, quite realises th*t the discretion for landing must be left in the hnnda of the pilot but /ould it not be possible, however, for thie discretion to be exercised more frequently in favour of Kuwait ? 3. Dickson’s complaint in paragraphs 6 and 7 seems to me on the facts before me to be fully justified, and 1 trust th»t arran ements for remedying the present state of affairs regarding inadequate notice will be m e ao soon as possible. It is most important, as you will realise, to mRintaic the populrrity which Imperial Airways at present deservedly enjoy along the Arab Coast and to avoid giving the impression to the Arab 'ulers and their subjects that - once the Company have obtained their facilities - they no longer consider local convenience. I am sending e copy of this leV er and its enclosure to Dickson to whom I *ould be grateful if you would send a copy of your reply to me. Yours sinceiely, sd. T.C.Fowle.

When stating in your paragra.ph 4 that, o n every occasion in the past when you have investigated cases of delay in the receipt of telegrams, this has been due to the short hours that the Telegraph Office works at Kuwait, have you not overlooked the case reported in my letter of 13th May 1934 addressed to your Head Office in London with a copy to Imperial Airways at Cairo, Besrah, Bahrain and Karachi ?

I sm still of opinion that the responsibility for the remedying of the present considerable inconveniences caused to ell concerned at Kuwait, vide paragraph 3 of my letter No.927^8 of 4th December 1935, lies with Imperial Airways, and I trust that the latter will now take active steps / B.C.H.Cross Esq Manager, Imperial Airways Ltd., Ne®r East Area, Cairo.steps towards that end* 4. You ask, in paragraph 4 of your letter under reference, v/hether Colonel Dickson could do something to improve telegraphic communications. Colonel Dickson has, however, nothing to do with these communications. A he Post Office in Kuwait is under the Iraq Government and surely it is the business of Imperial Airways to arrange with the Iraq Telegraph Authorities that their messages are not delayed. I do not knocw whether Colonel Dickson’s suggestion in para graph 8 (a) of his letter is feasible or not, but personally I do not see why his suggestion in paragraph 8 (b) and lc) of his letter, as to Imperial Airways telegraphing from Karachi onthe one side and Bagdad on the other, should not be put immediately into effect. 5. I hope I shall receive an early reply that the present unsatisfactory fctate of affairs at Kuwait is being amended. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to Imperial Airways Head Office in London and to Colonel Dickson at Kuwait.

Perhapsmight have worded my letter BCHC/lG.2d6d of the 13th. December 1935 to Colonel Powle, a little more carefully. I might have said that Koweit ! s telegraph office was open for comparatively short hours. The position is that at Basra, Bahrein, Sharjah, Karachi and Baghdad, we have a 24 hour system available, and, therefore, you will readily appreciate that your 8 hour system is comparatively short. You will notice that a telegram despatched, shall vie say from Bagfthd to Koweit at approximately 6.30 to 7 p.m. will probably not be delivered until 8 a.m. the follow r ing morning or even later. The same applies to anything sent from Bahrein, Sharjah or Karachi. Is it really impossible to arrange that Basra has a Switch system such as I know can readily be introduced so that when the telegraph is not operating, the system can be used as a telephoned This would not be perfect but it would at least give a service during the 12-| hours when your telegraphic service closes down.
