Resident in Persian Gulf on the subject of facilities at Fas *11 Khaimah. 2. It will be seen that the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah has asked for an alteration in the existing arrangements under which he provides refuelling facilities and the Political Agent, Bahrein suggests an alternative arrangement which would not involve any extra expenditure. At the same time the Political Agent raises the question whether continued expenditure on the provision oat. such facilities is in fact justified by the requirements of the flying boat services. 3. I am to enquire whether in the light of the enclosed correspondence the Secretary of State for Air desires that revised arrangements should be made on behalf of His Majesty’s Government with the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah on the lines indicated by the Political Agent, Bahrein.

Shortly before this the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah had aentloned to Captain Howes that he was dissatisfied with the payment he was receiving for air facilities. (He receives Ra.lOOA per mensem under the terns of his unsigned agreement and he is also paid Hs.l20A monthly for the hire of a dhow in which petrol is stored? Shortly afterwards the Baghdad Area Manager of the British Cverseas *lrw*ys Comorotion Informed me that the oyal Air Force had decided f to^reniove* the petrol dhow from Has al Fhaimah f or in other words to cease payment for it; and he added that his Company would like to send there a more satisfactory craft in which a 750 gallon tank had been Installed.

Subsequently it b^aiae clear that the haikh ©till expected to receive the full total of Ha. 220/- per mens era even if he did not provide the dhow. 3. On the 18th February last I met the Sheikh of Haa al Khaimah and he raised thie question. I pointed out that ii we (in we * i included the Airways Corporation) sent our own dhow he could scarcely expect ua to pay him hire for it. To thia hie reply was that he was dissatisfied with the ^ wfita h# was making out of the whole arranrement. He then proceeded v in response to an enquiry 9 to au&amp;jest that he should build a petrol store on the Chore for which he should receive the same hire as he now obtains for the dhow. He unj^rtook to build this at hla own expanse and it was explained to him that if the idea were approved he would have to build according to fixed specifications. It was also pointed out to him that there would have to be some means of ferrying the petrol from the store on the shore to flying boats in the creek. This he admitted though he did not wish the boat to be anchored in the fairway of the creek. 4# The oyal Air Force decision to cease payment for the dhow has been confirmed to me by the Air Liaison (ffleer| though I have asked tfuit it be continued until some alternative arrangement is made. As shown above e simple alternative la available! and one which I under* stand from the Company’s Superintendent at Sharjah and also from a representative of the Hafi^ian Oil Company whom I met at Sharjah would b# a cons id ora ble improvement on the present system. It would of course involve keeping a oo t with a 600 or 760 gallon tank in it tied up close to the petrol store! but this would involve little expense t and otherwise facilities at Has al xhaimah would cost exactly the amount that they have coat hitherto. There would /-would be lees wastage of petrol t whic* very considerable, and the mere fact « )bsiae' at the motnent u •shorejwould facilitate the extension tt any further facilities such as the erection of wireless masts 9 which might concelv* ably becocie necessary In the future. It is moreover apparent that without a shore store the provision of e boat with a 500 or 750 gallon tank as suggested by the Area Manager t Baghdad, would be quite uselees as the normal petrol lift of an Empire flying boat is 400 or 450 gallons. If therefore it Is desired to raeint^ln facilities at 3ae al Khali ah I suggest that 1 be authorised to come to an agree ment with the Shaikh on the above lines, 4, Before a decision la taken however I would suggest that consideration be given to the question whether alter native facilities at Haa al Khalmoh are really necessary, &amp;a can be more or less certain that any interruption at Dubai would not last more than three days and it is a question whether an outlay of £ 200/- a year is justifiable to re move the posaifcHity of so brief an interruption of the flying boat services, which should occur only very Infrequently, Vi# have recently experienced delays In these services extending to 11 days, i nd Inconvenient as this may be It scarcely seems to be a matter of vital Importance, particularly since the interruption of the flying boat services do^s not necessarily Involve a simultaneous interruption of the land plane services 3d/- H, Weightman.

You will see that while the Admiralty were prepared to agree on certain conditions, that the proposed discretion should be given, the Foreign Office share the reluctance of the Air Ministry and of ourselves to agree to the delegation of so wide a discretion. As the Foreign Office point out, the Resident like other superior officials far from their home Government must necessarily have a certain residuary discretion to act on his own responsibility if a crisis were so grave and imminent that he could await orders. But His Majesty*s Government are responsible for defending the Resident’s actions before Parliament and public opinion; and therefore, although, we are quite prepared to agree that in the circumstances contemplated immediate punitive measures against a recalcitrant Sheikh might well be necessary in certain cases, it is obviously desirable that, where the situation/ The Hon’ble Lt.Col.C.G.Prior, C.I.E.?

Sir Kingsley^ood, who is grateful for /tHe exhaustive review made by the Political Resident, has given careful 4 consideration to the determination of suitable ^alternatives .to Dabai and Sharjah in consultation with Imperial Airways. He shares the Company’s view that from an operational point. .• of view, a combined marine and land airport at Ras-el-Khaimah would be the best alternative, and in normal circumstances he would suggest that the Political Resident should negotiate with the Sheikh of Ras-el-Khaimah to enable the desired facilities to be provided. In view, hoover, of the War and the need for rigid economy. Sir Kingsley Wood now feels that the expenditure on providing the necessary ground organisation and on obtaining the necessary permission from the Sheikh would not be justified, especially as the Empire services are now reduced in number and are not under the same obligation as previously to adhere to a strict schedule. Imperial Airways have, therefore, agreed with his suggestion that until such time as it is possible to provide a combined airport at Ras-el-Khaimah Kalba should be regarded as the alternative land aerodrome to Sharjah, and Ras-el-Khaimah as the alternative alighting area to Dabai, with their existing facilities. Imperial Airways have, however, stated that it would be of great assistance if permission could be-granted to them to transfer, during the period of an emergency, the control launch (which is equipped with wireless) from Dabai to Ras-el-Khaimah provided that such procedure would not involve negotiating a fresh agreement with the Sheikh. In a telsrgram dated l 6 th June, 1999 (India Office reference ,P.Z. 57^9/99/ the Political Resident expressed the view that measures to render Ras-el-Khaimah a regular emergency stop, i.e. stationing of a re-fuelling launch and the right to erect, temporarily on the shore, a wireless set when required^ needed the Sheikh’s permission. Sir Kingsley Wood will, however, be grateful if the Political Resident will consider whether a temporary visit by the control launch to Ras-el-Khaimah would be contrary to the terms of the agreement with the Sheikh^and if so, whether the Sheikh might be induced to make such a'* concession without the negotiation of a new agreement.

Dear Peel, A-^ z In your letter P.Z. 4857/39 of the 23rd August you asked for our comments on the suggestion made by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in his Express Letter No. C 240 of the 28th June that he be given discretion to request the Air Officer Commanding and Senior Naval Officer to use punitive measures against any Sheikh whose action is imperilling the safety of aerodromes. 2. We agree with you that there seems to be considerable objection to giving the Political Resident the specific discretion for which he asks, but in order that there may be no misunderstanding I should like to explain our reasons for holding this view. 3. Leaving aside the question of the precise relationship between His Majesty’s Government and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, and taking, at the same time, full account of the policy of His Majesty’s Government to ossible in the internal affairs and interfere as^ little*, COPY SENT ASSCMAU of ji | (.{«£&gt; yO 4 R.T. Peel, Esq, C.B.E. , M.C. enclosure m air mail letter No. 2V : -9 JAN 1940 FROM SECRETARY, POUTfCAL DEPT. ^ 1NOIA OFFICEand administration of the Sheikhdoms, it is nevertheless probably true to say that their relations with the Sheikhdoms are of such a kind as to place upon His Majesty*s Government the ultimate responsibility for the maintenance of order and good government in the territories concernecU At any rate His Majesty’s Government are responsible for order and good government where the interests of third powers are concerned, I know that juridically speaking the Trucial Sheikhdoms are not in the position of Indian States, but what I have in mind is something akin to the admitted right of the Paramount Power to interfere in the internal affairs of the Indian States when their administration fails to produce a certain minimum level of good government or acts in a manner seriously prejudicial to the interests of the Paramount Power, 4, To carry the argument a step forward, it seems to us that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is in some respects at any rate in the position of an Indian or Colonial Governor or High Commissioner. In nomal cases a Governor or High Commissioner refers, I presume, to some higher authority (it may be His Majesty's Government or it may6, ' may be the Government of India) before taking drastic action. On the other hand, there must be times when any delay would be dangerous; he has to act on his own responsibility and the fact that he may so have to act is accepted and recognised. The Political Resident is, we suggest, in the same position and must be deemed to possess discretion in the last resort to take whatever steps he may think necessary to secure the vital interests of His Majesty*s Government in the States (with the possible exception of Muscat) for which he is responsible. If he can refer home before taking these steps he ought to do so, but if not he must act on his own responsibility. 5. But the degree of urgency cannot be laid down in advance and if the Political Resident finds it necessary to act in an emergency without reference to Kis Majesty*s Government, all that can be said is that His Majesty*s Government will examine as sympathetically as possible the explanations which he subsequently gives for his conduct. This, it seems to me, would apply to urgent action needed to secure the safety of Royal Air Force machines passing through the Trucial Sheikhdoms as well as to all other matters.6 . But it is quite a different thing to say that the Political Resident may have authority to act without reference home for one specific purpose and not for others. If the line of reasoning set out above is correct, he has this authority anyhow, subject to subsequent justification of the urgency of the peril, but if there is time to refer home there is no reason why he should not do so in connexion with the defence of Royal Air Force machines any more than in connexion with any other question. 7. The question also arises how far the local naval and air commanders could or should take action at the request of the Political Resident, and in the absence of specific instructions. But I suppose the same problem arises elsewhere, and they, too, presumably have a residuary discretion to act on their own responsibility in an emergency. 8 . We do not feel that this is a question which closely concerns the Foreign Office, since it does not seem likely that the interests of any third power would be involved, and it is the India Office who are responsible for1 for the administration of the Arab coast of the Gulf. But I thought that it would be as well to let you know fairly fully how we look at the problem.

My Lords entirely agree that the direction requested should he granted on the undertaking (a) that it is limited, as suggested hy the Resident, to those cases in which local trouble coincides with a major crisis; (h) that all possible precautions should be taken to ensure that bombardment would only cause damage to the forces, forts or personal establishments of the Sheikh concerned, and that danger to innocent civilian life would be avoided. In this connection My Lords assume that the Resident would be guided by the advice of the Senior Naval Officer as to the practicability of the various possible objections having the foregoing considerations in mind; (c) that the Resident should report home immediately when he is making, or about to make, requests for bombing or bombardment to be carried out. also My Lords/observe that in paragraph 6 of his letter the Resident suggests that Khor Kuwai could be used as an alternative alighting place for sea-craft. In view of the importance of this base to the Navy, My Lords are anxious to be kept informed of any action taken on this suggestion. The Under Secretary of State, In/ INDIA OFFICE, S.W.l. MAN RECd.

It is true that H.M. Ships may in war have to use his ports and waters whatever his attitude may be, but it is convenient also to have at Khor Kuwai in peace certain facilities which could be quickly expanded in time of war, and My Lords consider that it is most desirable to avoid any action which might result in the Sultan withdrawing them.

This telegram from the Political Resident refers to his Express Letter of the 28th June and flagged 3. This Letter contains various proposals for improving the air services in the Gulf and on the Trucial coast in particular during times of crisis, such as the recent Dehai-Sharjah disturbances. It is at present under consideration by the Air Ministry, who have explained in their interim reply of the 31st July that they have had to take the whole question of alternative A landing grounds and marine alighting areas with Imperial Airways/who promise their considered opinion at the earliest possible moment. This is the answer to (b) of the Resident’s telegram. But paragraph 4 of his letter also contained a suggestion which we saw no reason to deal with separately from the rest of the letter, that the Resident should be given discretion in time of emergency to request the Air Officer Commanding and the Senior Naval Officer to use punitive measures, i.e. bombing and bombardment^in order to bring pressure to bear on any Sheikh whose actions were rendering the use of any aerodrome unsafe for the use of aircraft. Before punitive measures are put into operation the Sheikh would receive due warning and Sir Trenchard Powle thinks it is probable that the mere threat would be a sufficient deterrent. I do not consider that it would be desirable to give the Resident such discretion in times of peace and I should imagine that the Air Ministry may be inclined to take the same view. We might also consult the Foreign Office and Admiralty on this particular point before we get the Air Ministry’s reply, as Sir Trenchard/ (6610) Wt.25956/235 10,000 9/38 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd.

S.14-6932/C.O. 1. fS' Dear GiDson, 31st July, 1939« Ch,/ lo ^ COPY SENT BY AIR'-MAIE^ \2L With reference to previous correspondence about disturbances in the Persian Gulf we had reached the conclusion that the only thing to do was to ask the Political Resident to negotiate a fresh agreement witn tne Sheikh of Ras-el-Khaimah which would allow Imperial Airways to provide ground facilities on a somewhat more liberal scale than is possible at present. The Dispatch dated 28th June from the Political Resident, which reached us under cover of your official letter 01 20th July PZ 4l4f 39 has raised wider issues and it is therefore necessary us to consider in consultation with Imperial Airv/ays whether any of the other alternative marine alighting areas and landing grounds mentioned by the Political Resident could be used on the Empire Services in emergency. With re ard to land aerodromes the position is made more difficult by the fact that the Company are prooosing to operate the landplane service with the large Ensign type of aircraft as from the middle ox September. We shall let you know our considered opinion at the earliest possible moment. Yours sincerely, J. P. Gibson, Esq., India Office, King Charles Street S.W.l. aoidjo vioni I 6 C ‘Adscnod * a 03dwhich opinion appears to differ somewhat from that held by the Air Officer Commanding, I submit that it can only render the Resident’s task in a crisis more difficult if he receives what seem to be conflicting points of view on the use of aerodromes by aircraft* This is a technical point on which he must rely on the opinion of some one authority. It appears to me that the competent authority in this case is the xiir Officer Commanding who is the representative of the nir Ministry for the Persian Gulf, and that it is on the opinion of tnis official that the Resident must rely* (b) With regard to the re-arrangement of their time-tables mentioned by Imperial airways. Doubtless this may cause minor difficulties, but it seems to me essential only that safety should come before schedule. It was^he land- plane service which would have been affected, and the land- planes could have night-stopped at either Jiunri or Bahrain without much dislocation of time-tables. (c) With regard to Imperial Airways suggestion in the last sentence of your paragraph 2 * The responsibility for deciding whether such technical action is necessary lies, it seems to me, with the ^ir Officer Commanding. At the same time such technical action has to be considered from the political point of view. Further, it is essential in case of urgency that both the xtir Officer Commanding and the Resident should be informed as speedily as possible of the technical requirements of the Company. I suggest therefore that such requests should be addressee to the ~ir Officer Commanaing as well as tne Resident - your telegram under reference was not repeated to tne Air Officer Commanding. 3e Reference your paragraph 3 . / (a)(a) I had telegraphed the Air Officer Commanding and the Government of India to warn Imperial Airwaya that their machines might have to uae Kalba. The Political Agent, Bahrain, who will he the political officer on the apot.has my authority to divert services of the Company if necessary. In the firs* Instance he warns the Station Superintendent, Sharjah, that such diversions may have to he made, and isauM tha final instructions to that official if and when necessary. It is for the Utter to keep his Area Managers at Bagdad and Karachi informed of the warning and of the final instructions. (h) The Air Uinistry‘s assunption re non-abandonment of the fort aerodrome equipment and wireless station is correct. The fort would still have been held by the *“ P erial Airways personnel and the Shaikh's guards even though the aerodrome would not be in use. Political Agent, Bahrain, is of the opinion that these guards can be trusted as they have *ee» recruited from the Batineh and are therefore not interest ed in local quarrels. Further, if it had been necessary, a party could have been landed from the sloop off Sharjah the defence of the Fort* (c) Might accommodation for passengers from Debai. It is out of the question that if a state of affairs existed which necessitated the closing of the aerodrome local conditions would permit of passengers taking the 8 mile drive from Debai to the Sharjah fort and back in srfety. especially as this drive would probably have to be made at night. i Hr Officer Commanding tele- 4 During the crisis the Air uinoo. «b.« *u. / AirwaysAirways and Royal Air Force Valencia aircraft he doubted whether it would be safe for Blenheims, and that it was essential that Sharjah aerodrome should be available by the 16th July when Blenheims were due to refuel en route to India* there are circumstances, e*g. a major crisis in the Far 2ast or in the Horth West Frontier of India, in which it might be essential for Blenheims, or similar craft, to refuel at Sharjah without any delay and their passage mi#it coincide with a local ci-isis similar to that which has just occurred* The present crisis has been successfully dealt with by peaceful means, but this has naturally taken time, and in case of urgency time might not permit for this method of procedure# To meet this eventuality therefore I suggest that the Resident should be given discretion to request the Air Officer Commanding and the Senior flaval Officer to use punitive measures,i.e. bombing and bombardment* These measures would be directed agains any Shaikh otiose action rendered the use of any aerodrome unsafe for the use of aircraft# It is needless to say that before such measures would actually be put into force the Shaikh in question would receive due warning# It is also very probable that the mere threat of such punitive action would be a sufficient deterrent, but it is In sor opinion essential that the Resident should have the powers at his disposal# 5 * It is only too obvious that the strength of an air route, like that of a chain, is that of its weakest link. It seems to me essential therefore that the Trucial Coast link should be strengthened as soon as passible by the provision of alternative alighting areas suitable for every type of / aircraft-5- aircraf t, Royal Air Jorce and ciTil, land and sea» have to use the route* Thus, when and if there is trouble in one of the States in which an alighting area is situated air craft can be diverted to another, in which peaceful conditions prevail. The present facilities on the Trucial Coast section are (a) Debai alighting area, suitable, I assume, for all types of seacraft* (b) Sharjah landing ground, suitable, I assume, for all types of landcraft* (c) Has &amp;1 Khaimah (i) A creek on which Imperial Airways and Royal Air Force flying boats have alighted, the former only in an emergency* There are fuelling facilities for Royal Air Force craft, but these can only be used at some inconvenience by Imperial Airways* There are no W^E facilities* (ii) A piece of ground on which Royal Air Force land machines have alighted* (d) Kalba (i) Sxposed seaplane anchorage* (ii) Bmergency landing ground opinions as to which for use by Imperial Airways machines seem to differ (see paragraph 2 (a) above and which is unsuitable for Blenheims (seeparagraph 4 above). 6 .

The area on ^iich Royal Air iorce machinea have alighted could perhapa be made into land ing ground auitable for all typea of landcraft. (3) Kalba. This landing ground could if practicable be improved to make it without queation auitable for all typea of landcraft. Thia, I suggest, should be the first possibility to be investigated. (4) Any other area between Debai and Kalba technically suitable. From the political point of view (1) Bebai aa an alternative landing ground is too close to Sharjah aerodrome since trouble in th» latter State would probably be connected with similar trouble m the former. (2) Has al Khaimah aa an alternative alighting area for land and air craft is sufficiently removed from Sharjah and Bebai to form a auitable alternative, but an approach would have to be made to a rather difficult Shaikh to obtain the necessary facilities. (3) Khor Khawi aa an alternative alighting area for aeaoraft. There is very little danger of local disturbances in this Bi te and I do not anticipate that the Sultan of Kuacat, in whose territory it is. will raise difficulties aa to giving permissionfor its use by Royal Air Force and Imperial Airways craft. It ia already used, with the / permission© •7 permission of the Sultan, as a fcase by the Persian Gulf Division of the Havy. (4) Kalha* Vhat is required here is an extension 0 ^ the present facilities vfeich should not be difficult to arrange from the political point of view. Prom the point of view of security it is well removed from the other States of the Trucial Coast. 8. It is now for the Air Ministry, I suggest, to decide what alternative alighting areas are required and to specify details of the facilities required at the areas selected. sd. T.C.Jowle.

As a result of these discussions it was agreed that Khor Ouwai is quite suitable as an alighting area for modern flying boats of types similar to the Imperial Airways Empire flying boats. Under certain circumstances this alighting area might be difficult for old type flying boats such as the R.A.F* 'Singapore* ty$e. This would occur when there was a swell and no wind, but Commander Ellison did not consider, that these conditions would prevail very frequently. 4. Mr. Marais, Local Manager of Imperial Airways has been informed verbally of the above and he states he will go into the question and report whether he agrees that Khor q,uwai ie» suitable* I have the honour to be.

No. 2 7 30 JUN 1939 Dear Gibson, FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL DEPT. INDIA OFFICER With rei*erbnce to our telephone conversation this morning in Which you mentioned that the word ’’Kalat' in the telegram from the Political Resident, No.336 of 17th June, should have read ’’Kalba 1 ’, I have consulted Imperial Airways and the Service side of the Air Ministry with regard to the possibility of using Kalba. The Company do not feel disposed to use it as a regular emergency stop since they regard it as suitable only for forced landings. The aerodrome is completely devoid of facilities. Moreover, Sharjah is scheduled as a night stop on the landplane services and if it is omitted there is no place between Bahrein and Karachi where there is night stop accommodation. The distance between Bahrein and Karachi is over 1,000 miles and a complete rearrangement of timetables would be necessary even if Kalba, from the operational point of view, were adequate. We assume that even if Sharjah aerodrome has to be closed to traffic the fort and the aerodrome with its equip ment and the wireless station would not be abandoned. The passengers on any flying-boat services which nightstop at Dubai travel overland by car to Sharjah where they spend the night. Although, under present timetables, Dubai is not scheduled a night stop, there is always the possibility that an occasional service might have to remain there overnight. Finally, the Company suggest that, if in the last^ resort it is necessary to use Kalba, the A.O.C. might be asked to station there and operate with R.A.F. personnel a pack wireless set. J.P.

Air Ministry state that omission of stop at Sharjah would require unbroken flight from Bahrein to Kalat which is beyond range of land machines used by Imperial Airways. Suggestion of Air Officer Commanding must have been made under misapprehension. Closure of Sharjah aerodrome would in fact mean complete interruption of land machine service, and Air Ministry urge that everything possible should be done with the naval and air force resources available to you to avoid the necessity for so extreme a step. 3. Your telegram of the 14th June, 330. Your action is approved.

The majority of the file is devoted to proposals made by Sir Trenchard Craven William Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in his letter dated 28 June 1939: see folios 44-50. His proposals can be summarised as follows:Alternative landing facilities should be established for use in the event of civil disturbances at Sharjah and Dibai [Dubai].The Political Resident should be given the discretion – in the event he is unable to consult the home government – to use force against ‘troublesome Shaikhs’ that threaten the continued operation of the Air Route.There is also a small amount of discussion in the file around the possibility of negotiating a fresh agreement with the Shaikh of Ra's al-Khaymah for the provision of air facilities.The main correspondents in the file are as follows: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Charles Geoffrey Prior), officials of the Air Ministry, officials of the Foreign Office, and officials of the India Office (J P Gibson and Roland Tennyson Peel). The Admiralty is also consulted over the Resident's proposals.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
