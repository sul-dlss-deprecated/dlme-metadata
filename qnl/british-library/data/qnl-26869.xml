I have the honour to refer to my telegram No.l dated the 2nd January, 1930, regarding the appointment of Iraqi Consular Officers in Persia. 2. The Secretaryof State for the Colonies has telegraphed in reply that no objection is taken to the procedure adopted by the Iraq Government. 3. I learn, however, that the Iraq Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in notifying the appointments to the Persian Minister here, requested him to ascertain whetherthey had the approval of the Persian Government. They did not furnish him with King Faisal’s Commissions of Appointment for the nominees. Nevertheless it appears that the Persian Minister, in conmunieating their request to his Government, has suggested the issue of exequaturs by His Majesty the Shah. So far there lias been no reply from Tehran to this request. 4. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not consulted me as to the suitability or otherwise of Kamil Beg al Gilani to be Iraqi Consul at Kermanshah or of Ahmad Zaki Beg al Khaiyat to be Vice Consul at Huhamraerah; but I see no grounds for objection to either SIR ROBERT H.CLIVE, K.C.M.G., HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S MINISTER, TEHRAN.(3 &lt;o either appointment. Kamil Beg has held the post of Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the past two years. Ahmad Aaki is a young Shiah of Baghdad who has been employed in the administration since 1920. He became qaimnaqam at Tuwairij in 1928 and was transferred to Qurna last year. He appears to be energetic and capable. He is a protege of Yasin Pasha, the Minister of Finance. 5.

Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 40050/27 of December 22nd, on the subject of the possible attachment of Iraqis to His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran or Consulates in Persia, 2. As regards Sir R. Clive’s letter of February 5th last to Sir H. Dobbs, to which reference is made in paragraph 2 of your letter, the Secretary of State observes that Sir Robert considered it feasible to employ an Iraqi in the Vice-Consulate only, and not in the Chancery of His Majesty's Legation. Since that date, moreover, the whole question of attaching Iraqis to British consulates in Persia or elsewhere has been under the consideration of Sir Austen Chamberlain, who feels himself unable to depart from the view set forth in h('2f&gt; V' Foreign Office letter No.E 10217/15 6 6/25 0 of August 16 that the proposal is impracticable. In his opinion this decision must apply equally to the attachment of Iraqis to His Majesty's Diplomatic Missions. 3. In these circumstances I am to suggest that Sir H. Dobbs be instructed to explain to the Iraqi Government that there are insuperable technical objections to the attachment of Iraqis to any of His Majesty’s Diplomatic/ The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office-Diplomatic Missions or Consulates abroad. 4. The Secretary of State shares the hope express ed in paragraph 2 of Sir E. Ellington’s letter of November 5th to the Acting President of the Iraqi Council of Ministers, that the problem of arranging for Iraqis to be trained in diplomatic and consular work may now in point of fact be simplified, seeing that Iraq is about to establish diplomatic and consular missions at Angora and Cairo respectively, which should serve as training centres for Iraqi diplomatic and consular officers. I am etc., (Signed) LANCELOT OLIPHAHT.3982/27 (Vt) 36 Minute Paper. Political Department. Tne original proposal of the T Irac Government, that 'I rac is should be attached to British Consulates for training ourooses in Persia and elsewhere in the Near Hast, was negatived by the Foreign Office, after consult~ -ing Sir R.Clive and British Consular Representatives in Damascus, Beyrout and Bushire ( se,i F.O. letter of 1 Bth ? 4028/27 August to Colonial Office). In the course of the corr- -espondence the views of this Office were consulted, and it was stated in our letter of 11th March to the Foreign ? 949/21 Office that the Secretary of State for India could not agree to the attachment of f -Iraqis to any British Consul- -ate maintained by the Government of India or in any area in which Indian interests are cpnsideraole. Sir R.Clive, while recognising that the objections seen from the point of view of India to the proposal could not De fully ap- fim/il -oreciated in Tehran, seemed not indisposed to have ’Iraqi attaches in British Consulates in Western Persia, assuming that there were no valid le^al grounds for ?er- -sia to urge against the nominations. Thi aspect of t ne matter was not further discussed at the time. It seems however somewhat anomalous, if Iraq is shortly to be sep arately reoresented at Angora and Constantinople by persons presumably accredited by the King of ’Iraq, that at the same time she should have representation in Brit- 2280 5000 9/27 -ish Consulates in ’ersia. outBut the Colonial Office are now inviting reconsiuerat i -ion of a separate cuestion raised in Sir K.Clive s letter of 3th February 1927 to Sir H. Dodos, namely whether pend- -ing :ersia s recognition of 'Irac^ an ’ I rapi might be attached to H.M.Legation, Tehran, to help in looking after ’Iraci interests. Sir R.Clive made it clear that he did not want an T Iraci in the Chancery of the Legation , but *as prepared to consider the appointment of an 'iraci as an Assistant Probationer Vice-Consul in the Vice-Consulate. The Foreign Office said at the time that they could not consider this cuestion till they had had the comments of Sir R.Clive and others on the general cuestion of train- -ing ’Iraqis. It had until now been assume^ that the F.O. letter of 1*th August disposed of this suggestion as well as the question of training, and the Colonial Office ap- -pear to have taken the same view ' see para.7 of their letter of 12th September co Sir H.Dobbs). As the High Commissioner is apparently reluctant to tell the ’Iraq Government that His Majesty’s Government cannot accede to their proposals the Colonial Office have raised that as regards Tehran again, relying on Sir R.Clive’s luke- -warm supoort of it, and have asked the views of the Sec- -retary of State for India again on the general question as well as that of the attachment of an ’Iraqi at Tehran. There seems no redtfon why the view enpressed in India Of- -fice letter of 1 1th March as regards the attachment of ’Iraqis for training should not still oe maintained. As regards the attachment of an Iraqi at Tehran for assist- -anceMinute Paper.

While therefore the proposal is oo 0 ectionaole as opening the door for further pressure to have 'Iraqis in the 3ulf and other Indian Consulates, it seems aifficult to oopose it if Sir R.Clive is found to be still prepared to support it.

If dir austen Chamberlain is unable to modify his previous view in regard to the proposed attachment of Iraqis to British Consulates in Persia, it is hoped that he will not feel the same oujaction to the proposal that an Iraqi should be attached to His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, particularly in view of the terras of dir u.Clive’s letter of the oth of February last (a copy of which accompanied Poroi/oi Office latter No. £.1262/302/65 of the 12th of April), from which it appears that, in his opinion, so far from being an embarrassment, an Iraqi attache miHit have a certain sphere of usefulness.

I enclose a copy of a letter which I subsequently addressed to him in reply. 3. This proposal, as you are aware, is distinct iron the more general proposal that Iraqis should be attached to British consulates for training to which your confidential despatch dated the 12th of September, 1927, referred and I am not aware whether the views expressed in that despatch may be regarded as applying also to the former proposal.

Indeed Sir Austen Chamberlain feels that it would be impossible for a consular officer to arrange for an Iraqi cadet attached to his office to receive any training which would be of real benefit to him and which would further the object enviaaged by the Iraq Government without grave inconvenience to the normal work of his cost. 3. Apart from these objections the Secretary of State considers that neither the British interests which His Majesty’s Consular The Under-Secretary of state, Colonial Office.Mi 61 W ^ Consular Officers exist to serve nor the foreignexs »ith whom they have to deal would appreciate the presence of an Iraqi and in all circumstances he regrets that he cannot agree to the proposal suggested in your letter under reply being made to the Iraq Government. 4. A copy of this letter is being sent to the India Office. I am.

The alternative suggestion made in paragraph ? of your letter under reoly that the Iran aovernsent should beoffered the cervices of a Senior Pritish Consular Officer for the purpose of supervising the formation and training of an Irani Consular Service is not, in the Secretary of State’s opinion, one which would commend itself to the irac Government. It is to be feared that they would regsrd such a suggestion merely as s further ntteapt - which t ey would feel bound to resist - to increase t e number of highly-©aid Pritish Officers whom they are reouired to e- ploy. Moreover, THE SSCBPTAKr OF STiTB, FOKBIOH OFFICE.® Gf Moreover, the expenditure involved in the &lt;u&gt;pointment of auch * n Officer would not be justified unless he were_on^s^ed in trnjnin»T: e nucber of Irooi cadets. The Iraq government hove hitherto shown no desire to multicly t te ntjmher o^ Irani Consuletes ebroed, nor, in the Seerete.ry o r State's opinion, is it desirable thnt they ehould be given any eneourai.-eirent to do so. It seeros orobeble that f e Iraq Government would he content were Ffis Ksjosty's Uovernrent to consent to the attachment of iraois to one or two of His Majesty’s Coamlates in the (fear or kiddle East. i:he Secretary of State fully Rnnreciatee the objections to the selection /or this ouroose of Consulates in hersia or Syria.where British Consuls are called upon to deal with a number of political ouestiona of importance and secrecy a n d where it would he difficult to prevent Irani Attaches frc * h,?vin ^ access to secret documents. But. he under stands that these objections are not of general applica tion, and he would suggest for Sir Austen C smberlein's consideration that it mirrht he practicable, as a purely temporary measure, and pending the establishment of Irani Consulates in Egypt and elsewhere, to which Iranis could in future be attached for training, to attach an Iraqi CfidetC*Het to His majesty’s Consulate General in Constantinoole and oossitly another to His ^aieety*s Consulate in Athens. This latter post would have the additional advantage that the present incumbent, Mr. Bullard, has served for a number of years in Iran and is familiar with the local language and customs. 4. The Secretary of State trusts that Sir Austen Chamberlain will see his way to concur in a proposal on these lines being made to the ir^n Govern ment. Hie moment appears particularly oooortune, since as Sir Austen Chamberlain is aware, it has been necessary during t^e last few months to onnose the wishes of the Irapr Government and to reouire H&gt;em to accept advice which is unpalatable to them on so many ioccasions that the harmonious relations hitherto existing between the two Government have been somewhat strained. The Secretary of State would be most reluctant, unless important Imperial interests are held to be involved, to reject a reaueet by the Iren Government for assistance which, on the face of it, is wholly reasonable and is in consonance with thewr AWAY with @ Register No. 372.7 Minute Paper. 2113 Secret.

A copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Consul at Damascus on the same question was transmitted to you in Mr.Gye's private letter Bo.X 4 674/1566/250 of April EUt to Mr.Hall. 2. In view of the various considerations urged in these despatches, and more especially of the objections put forward in paragraphs 2 and «5 of Colonel Haworth s iesT.- tc i of April 18th, as well as on general political grounds, the Secretary of State considers the proposal that Iraqis should be attached to British Consulates for training to be open to serious objection and impracticable. 3 . He realises, however, the desirability of offering the Iraq Government any assistance which may be possible to enable them to create an efficient antf capable consular service of their own, and he would therefore be prepared, should Hr.Secretary Amery concur, and should it be found practicable The Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office.&lt; ■%L mm ^Tp) &amp; practicabl* for th« Iraq Government to make the necessary financial arrangements, to offer the Iraq Government the services of a senior British consular officer for the purpose of helping to form and train an Iraqi consular service on the general lines of His Majesty’s Consular Service. 4.

I venture to agree with Mr. Secretary ornery in thinJdlng that, Binoe ’Iraqis will in no oase be destined for His Majesty's Consular Service, the training facilities thus afforded the mm will not be particularly invidious from the Indian point of view* 2 . X realise however that this aspect of the question may assume an Importance in ifelhi which it does not seem to possess in fehran; and should it be decided that It provides a sound reason for not attaching 'Iraqis to Consular Kstablishments controlled by the Government of India I do not consider that ’Iraqi interests would be very materially affected, provided that it were found possible to attaoh 'Iraqis to some of His Majesty's Consulates in western ~%rsia, including ^hwas which is now mainly under the control of the foreign Office.

Sir, With reference to your despatch No.34 (K 2634/1566/250) of March 2nd relative to the proposed training of Iraqis in His Majesty’s Consulates, I have the honour to report that, so far as I am concerned, I should have no objection to an Iraqi being attached to this post for instruction provided that it was clearly understood that he was a member of my staff for general duties and in no way specially designated to watch over Iraqis and their interests. Otherwise I might be inundated with petty complaints from Iraqi students and others which would normally settle themselves. Further, complete abstention from interference in local politics would have to be guaranteed. 2. Although the terms of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of October 10th, 1922 and what they imply must be perfectly well known both to the French and to those natives of this country who are interested, I thought well privately to ask the French Acting High Commissioner whether the presence of an Iraqi on my staff or on the staff at His Majesty’s Consul \ at Damascus would be likely to prove embarassing to the French authorities. After some little delay Monsieur De Reffye has written to say that, while he does not see any real obj ections His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, etc., etc., etc.,objections to the proposal, he would, for reasons which are obvious, prefer that any Iraqi gentleman selected for training should commence his consular education at Beyrout rather than at Damascus.

In reply to paragraph 2 df your letter, I have the honour to say that I think it would be undesirable to have Irakis in so intimate a relationship at Bushire. An Irak subject, unless he were pro British in temperament, might find his opinions in opposition to our interests. Indeed, it does not follow that because he were pro British that he Y/ould continue so in the future. 3. The present time has many important questions, such as the oil fields and measures for their protection, the air route by Arabia and the British position in the Persian Gulf, in which an Iraki might not see eye to eye with us. He would instantly get to know what was being suggested or being done, he would follow the itineraries of the Political Resident and his Political Agents, and would in general get to know too much. 4. I am of opinion that such ah official could learn his work in Palestine or elsewhere with less possible danger to us, 5. As Persia has not recognised Irak, the attachment of an officer would presumably be difficult at present, and this would perhaps form a convenient answer to the request. 6.

Although the plan is in the 'best spirit of the mandate, I cannot view with equanimity its applica tion in Syria. . The first effect would 'be to cheapen the position of a Consul in the eyes of the local population; to accept an Iraqi on the footing of a Student Inter preter is to admit the equality of the native, and a dangerous error in a country like Syria. 4. Moreover the presence of an Iraqi probationer in this Consulate could not fail to give umbrage to the French Delegation, who cannot be expected to see in it anything but a further insidious attack on their own positions. If I may invite a reference to the concluding paragraph of your despatch No..108 (Secret) of the 1st November last (S 5933/52/89) you will recollect that you furnished me with the most precise instructions M not merely to maintain a negative attitude of aloofness, but by evincing a sympathetic understanding of His Majesty*s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, &amp;c ., 8cc ., &amp;c ., Foreign Office, LOITFQN, S.W.l.

Hie My dear Dobba, I have been pondering your confidential letter of January 20th relating to the suggestion of your Prime Minister that pending Persian reeognition of ’Ira* aaj Iraqi representative should be attached to this Legation in order to help us in looicing after ’Iraqi interests and to keep us acquainted at first hand with the views and needs of ’Iraq. assuming that it is eventually decided to attach an ’Iraqi representative to the Legation, he would appear to have two possible spheres of usefulness, (a) to assist the Vice Consul (b) to assist the Chancery in dealing with our numerous Perso**Iraq cases. As regards (a) the Vice Consul tells me that an ’Iraqi might b© very useful in dealing with applications for ’Iraq nationality f passports etcetera which have to be transmitted to Baghdad* He would require to have a really good knowledge of English and Persian and his usefulness would of course very much depend on his ability and character. As regards (b) there are obvious objections to his working in the Chancery as we obviously cannot let him loose in our archives* If on the other hand a separate room could be found for him - a somewhat difficult matter with our limited accommodation * he oould be sfrown certain files relating to claims and other frontier matters, while he could interview the camel drivers who constantly worry us iSxcellency * * 3ir Henry K.C* hobbs, K.C.3.I., K.C.M.G., K.O.BJfi., His Majesty’s High Commissioner for ’Iraq, Baghdad./ u» about their olaima again at the Alimentation Department. But on the whole it would rather be a oase of our teaching him than of hia being much help to ua. I think therefore that if an f Iraqi is to be sent here he had better be attached to the Vice-Consulate where he could work in the same room as the probationer. His work would be Consular but we should always be free to consult him on relevant politioal questions • and to show him such of the politioal files as are not open to objection. The extent of our confidence would of course depend on his character. I imagine, subject to the views of the foreign Office that he would be attached to the Legation as Assistant Probationer Vice Consul and that we should notify his appointment in that capacity to the Persian Government. I am sending copies of this correspondence privately to Gliphant at the Foreign Office. (Signed) H.H. dive.Mr Barrett I have had a conversation with Mr Gye of the foreign Office about the question of attaching Iraqis Mr Gye tells me that the original Colonial Office proposal was communicated to Tehran and to various Consular authorities for their views, but replies are not yet to hand.

An • 0 .(S) ^ / Under Secretary of State The attached demi-official letter from the Colonial Office is submitted for consideration and for instructions. It explains clearly the difficulties in which the Colonial Office have been placed by the attitude of this Office, and makes suggestions which the Colonial Office hope may lead to a modification of that attitude. The first suggestion - that Iraqi Consular Officers should be expressly excluded from having official dealings with Indians - rather misses the point. It might be possible, though awkward, to arrange this; but it would be more difficult - or probably impossible in areas where Indian interests are considerable - to arrange that Iraqis should not deal with Indian interests . The second suggestion, for camouflaging the Iraqis as special assistants to deal with temporary accession of Iraq work, might help a little; butbut it will probably not be considered that the suggestions T dispose of 1 the objections raised by this Office. I venture to suggest^however,that some relaxation might without serious objection be made to meet the difficulties of the Colonial Office. The wording of our first letter (9th February) appears to leave the Colonial Office free to send Iraqis to any of the Consulates not maintained by India - i.e. to Tehran, Ramadan, Resht, Ispahan, Sultanabad, Yezd, Kermanshah, Shiraz, Tabriz, or possibly Ahwaz (where the Foreign Office maintains the Consul, but India the Vice-Consul). Our letter of the 11th March definitely extends the embargo to all areas in which Indian interests are considerable. This would no doubt cut Ahwaz out of the foregoing test, and perhaps Tehran; I am not sure whether it was intended to cut out ary other area. There seem&lt;S) % 3. seem therefore to be a number of possible Consulates left to the Colonial Office. But the Colonial Office have explained orally that the Gulf area seems to them the only approoriate place to which to send Iraqis, - partly because the further they are from Tehran the better (they think there might be difficulties with the Persian (Government, with which Iraqis are not popular). The Colonial Office have also stated orally that if they could avoid announcing to the Iraq (Government an absolute embargo on the (Gulf area, they could in practice probably arrange to meet the views of this Office to the extent of sending only a very small number of Iraqis to these parts at a time. fke largest single concession to the Colonial Office would no doubt be to allow one or uiVo Iraqis at Bushire; and this seems to me nou open to serious objection from our point of4. of view. There is a largish staff already at Bushire. One or two Iraqis would probably not be noticed much, and thesuggested Camouflage 1 would be fairly plausible. Assuming that the Colonial Office arguments are not considered to justify a more extensive departure from previous standpoint, I would suggest that if it is thought proper to make some concession a reply might be sent to the Colonial Office saying that our letters may be interpreted as leaving them free to send Iraqis to all the places in the above list except Ahwaz and Tehran; and that in order to meet their difficulties we would also be willing (provided the Government of India do not object) to allow one or two Iraqis at Bushire, subject to the conditions proposed in Mr.Hall 1 s letter. The Colonial Office could then write to us officially with a view to settling the matter on these lines. 2v.5 It L.D.WAKELY,ESQ,., C.M.G. / S&gt; i ■&gt;-&gt; Ho.40132/27. Downing Street, XI ** March, 1927. M ttp hi hukiA* / . J A /i**r ao^jf Afo I spoke to you ecuaoout the proposal to attach Iraqis to certain British Consulates for training in Consular work. As I then explained, your official letter of the 11th of March (P.949/27) has placed us in rather a difficult position. On the one hand, we naturally do not wish to do anything which would in any way embarrass you in India but, on the other hand, by the terms of Article 5 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922, we are definitely committed to the principle that Iraqi Consulates should be established abroad. Indeed, we have recently authorised the High Commission to tell the Iraq Government that we have no objection to the appointment of Iraqi represent atives to Turkey and Persia, and, in view of our Mandatory responsibility we clearly cannot decline to assist the Iraq Government in training a Consular Service., It is unlikely that for some years to come the ♦ * Iraq Government will wish to set up Consulates outside the neighbouring countries (except perhaps in a few of the European capitals). Consequently, to be of real value the instruction of Iraqi Consular Officers should be carried out somewhere in the Middle East, where they will be made familiar with the actual conditions under t which they will ultimately be required to work. For this purpose, the Middle East may, I think, be limited to Syria, Egypt, Turkey and Persia. Syria obviously cannot be selected as the principal training ground. A sudden influx of Iraqi Consular Officers would only serve * to increase the present French distrust of Faisal and his Government founded on the belief that the Syrian rebels have drawn considerable moral and material support from t Iraq. Egypt in view of the Anglophobe sentiment which would be encountered there and with which unsophisticated Iraqis would probably become infected, would be almost equally unsuitable. As you know, Iraqis are far from welcome in Turkey where the chronic unrest among the Kurds is generally attributed to British and Iraqi machinations, and, in any case, the southern Vilayets of Turkey are at present closed toy^T) to all foreigners. P^J- , This leaves only Persia and the Persian Gulf and here you have placed an embargo. As I understand it, your objections to the attachment of Iraqis to British Consulates in Persia are twofold. Firstly, it is felt r undesirable that Iraqis should hold any official position in a British Consulate which would bring them into contact with Indians, because, owing to thefact that Indian and Iraqi interests are not infrequently conflicting, there might be some danger that Indians would not receive fair treatment at their hands. Secondly, there is the reason explained in your official letter of the 9th of February, namely that the attachment of Iraqi Consular Officers to British Consulates and the subsequent establishment of Iraqi Consulates would add fuel to the present grievance of British Indians that they are not eligible for admission to the British Diplomatic and Consular Services. Clearly these objections are formidable ones, but it seems possible that to some extent at least they might be overcome. Surely, the first objection could be met by the issue of circular instructions to British Consular Officers in Persia and the Persian Gulf to the effecteffect that no Iraqi Consular Officers attached to them should he allowed to come into official contact with or to have any official dealings with British Indians. As regards the second objection, it seems possible that a little permissible 'camouflage 1 might meet the case. As you probably know, circular instructions in regard to the acquisition of Iraq nationality and the issue of Iraqi passports have just been * &lt; issued. This will throw a considerable amount of extra work upon our Consulates in the Middle East. In the circumstances, it would not seem unreasonable that the staff of those * Consulates should be temporarily increased and that the increased staff should be furnished by the Iraq Government who have created the extra labour. This would, I think, afford a reasonable explanation of the temporary presence of Iraqi Officers in British Consulates in Persia andoneto which British Indians could hardly take exception. Of course, dealing with applications for Iraq Nationality papers would not provide a whole-time job for an Iraqi at any British Consulate, but it would occupy a fair amount of his time and in the remainder he could gain an insight into the general work o- a ConsulatemmMatHmmmmmmmmmmtK 1685a 5000 1/27 io&lt; Draft Paper. v&gt;UT V\MTH •j*-l p 94^/27 ?oiitioai Department Confidential E.B*Ho*veli Esq G*S.

The Colonial Office would seem to have deiioerate- -ly misunderstood this Office letter of 9th February which said that the Secretary of State ' cannot regard with favour a proposal which in effect gives to sub 0 ects of T Iraq an advantage which is denied to British Indians, who, as Mr Secretary Amery is doubtless aware, are not eligible for admission to the Diplomatic and Consular Services. This aspect of the proposal would be partioul- -arly marked if ’Iraqis were attached to British Consulate in Persia ...” It is of course understood that 'Ixaqis would not be attached to British Consulates with a view to entry into the British Consular Service. But it was felt here that their employment for purposes of training in British Consulates,where employment, for purposes of training or otherwise, is not offered to Indians,would stress in a manner particularly disagreeaoie to Indian susceptibilities the difference in status of the ’Iraqi under mandate ,leading up to indepenaenoe in foreign reiat- -ions,and of the Indian under the Government of Incia Act. Employment of 'Iraqis in our Consulates in Persia would oe all the more objectionable to Indian feeling seeing that they are partly paid for from Indian revenues. This if not specifically stated could at any rate have oeen inferred with average intelligence from the passage of our letter quoted above. It. does not seom desiraole to reply to the ColonialOffice^ho arf» not in a mood to be convinced, oei'ore con- -sulting the Government of India, who may be expected to dislike this proposal and to wish to express their views. Copy of Colonial Office letter of 26th January and of our reply of 9th ^eoruary have by now reached India. Copy of the latter was however sent personally to Mr Howell, the Indian Foreign Secretary, in accordance with the instruct- -ions of the Under-Secretary of State, and it would not be appropriate to refer to it in official correspondence with India on account of the channel of transmission. It seems that the easiest way out of the difficulty will be to send a private telegram to the Viceroy reierrin to the enclosure sent privately to Mr Howell and request- _ing that the subsequent message asking for the views of the Government of India, which would otherwise have been sent officially, may be made official. A draft private telegram is submitted accordingly. 26th February 1927* ! m Communications on this subject should be addressed to— &lt;3&gt; The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l.

I think this is a very objectionable proposal so far as consulates in the Indian sphere of interest are concerned. Not only will it have the effect - as Sir M. Seton points out - of stimulating the Indian demand for admission to the Diplomatic Service: but there is also the practical objection that in the Indian sphere (e.g. Bushire, where Iraq wants to begin its experiment) the interests which the Consul has to look after are very largely Indian, and Indian and Iraqi interests do not always or even often coincide, and Indians and Arabs hate one another. It seems to me most impolitic to put an Iraqi in a position in which Indian interests may pass through his hands. I have altered the draft with Sir M.Seton’s concurrence.

The ’Iraq Government, looKin^ forward to the not distant future when 'Iraq will assume responsibility foi the conduct of its own external relations, have prefeireo what Sir Henry Doobs and the Colonial 01fice consiaer a reasonable request, namely that some 'Iraqhi oificials should oe attached for training to British Consulates * ^ ' r '^o ^ ^ ^ /f- L -it A' /. a in the Near East.. Sir Henr&gt; Dobbs suggests Kermanshah, 7C Beyrout and Damascus, the ’Iraq Government having ment- -ioned that it will shortly be necessary for them to establish consulates In the countries connected with 'Iraq geographically or oy trade. InoiGer.taily it appears preferable that Persia should recognise the 'Iraq Oovern- -ment before an 'Ira^/ official is sent to Persia, Lux it would appear that recognition is likely co come soon. It is not very clear why the Colonial Office have ^ TLy r-v ^ ^ ^ no. thought it necessary to consult the Inaia Office before T- addressing the foreign Office on this request. The quest- _ion of the propriety of training officials of mandated territory to assume the responsioilities which wixl dev.- -cive on them after the expiry of the mandate is one for v 'frC, the Colonial Office^to consider, ana it seems obvious that the mandatory power should assist in the training of officials for external as well as internal administration. The attachment of ' I raq\ji officials to consulates in D ersia staffed from India might raise inconvenient cuest-j -ions, out this need not prevent agreement with the pio--posal The foreign Office may see objections to the employment of other than British sub 0 ects in the con- -sulates, but that is a matter primarily for Foreign Office consideration. This however orings up the obvious objection to the Colonial Office proposals. The foreign Office recently approved ( P 2646/25) the attitude of Sir Percy Loraine in objecting to an Indian being left in charge of a Persian Consulate. They have sinb (D 3929/26) definitely ruled that Indians are not eligiole for appointment to the British Diplomatic Service. These &lt; criticisms and decisions were not well received by Indian | officials of the Government of India, and it may be antic-| -ipated that, however il logically, objection would be seen; • | in India to facilities being accordea to ’Ira^/l* officials-: to enable them to Qualify for staffing independent ’Ira^t consulates. In this connection reference may be made to the proposals in a note given by Mr Ba.ipai to Sir K.Hankey; a ter the Washington Conference in 1921. Mr Ba f) pai suggest- -ed tha 4 Indians should be attached to the Washington, Pari Tokio and 'erlin Embassies for training at the expense of Indian revenues with a view to ultimate appointment to the British, diplomatic service if the experiment were a success (F &amp; 0 1030/22). This suggestion was not pursued and Mr M.Seton commented at the time that'we should have to indian-- ~ize the Political Department first.” Sir Arthur Hirtzel also said ”If Sir M.Hankey makes a move there will be no difficulty in showing that the idea is impiaoticaole on the diplomatic side. 1 Since then it has been decided to recruitI(fo6 (3 Minute Paper.

Dear -ir Henry, It is well known that the mutual object of the i-raq and British Governments is to endeavour to enable Iraq to assume ^gradually the control of her internal affairs and the protection of her external interests, so that she may be able to dispense with the assistance of her Ally at the time of the termination of the AngLo-Iraq Treaty, tne of the matters which the Iraq Government has under consideration to this end is the creation of consulates in countries with which Iraq has important commercial relations or which are connected with Iraq by neighbourly relations. As Iraq has not many men well acquainted with the work of Consulates and their administration the Iraq Government wishes to employ Iraqi officials in British Consulates for training until her own Consulates are established in neighbouring countries. I beg Your Excellency to examine this proposal and to inform me of your opinion in.regard thereto. After agreement in principle has been reached we can then examine the necessary details. U.E.
