The technically qualified youths in the State have all been absorbed into employment by the Kuwait Oil Company and if Kuwaitis are to talie advantage oi the opportunities likely to occur in the future with the develop ment of the Company and with perhaps other companies there is no time to be lost» The Shaikh, the notables and merchants of the Town are well aware of this and the. merchants, with the blessing of the Shaikh, recently drew up a petition requesting that an additional tax be placed on the importation of goods other than those imported by British subjects,^nd al lotted to education# 4 # This has be ea approved by His Excellency and the sum so derived is to be accumulated until it reaches a useful figure which is calculated to be in six months time. A sub-commit tee of the Municipal Council, to whom the problem of improvement in education is entrusted is to raake recoromendations for the Shaikh* s approval for the use of the sum available# The present intention is to employ a number of foreign masters, perhaps five or six, at the existing AHMADXYA School founded in 19 31#__ p _ n Opinion varies as to frcm i/^iere the masters should ccme* Some merchants and perhaps the majority are of the opinion that they should be Iraqis, The Shaikh favours Syrians because they are less likely to be 'politicians' and because Syria has a longer history of modern education^ Any idea which once obtained, of sending off abroad an educational f, mission fT , that is a sroup of students, has been abandoned on grounds of expense. I thought from what His Excellency told me that the problem before Kuwait had not been clearly understood. 5 # The situation is that in Kuwait there are about 50 Bloraaic schools which form preparatory schools, and two more advanced schools in both of which English is taught and taught well, the iihmadiya and the American Mission Schools 7, it cannot be gainsaid that Kuwait would do well to increase and quickly the amount and quality of instruction at the Ahmadiya school* Syrian masters, for political and educational reasons, would be, I agree with the shaikh, more suitable than Iraqis to undertake this. They could not hope however to give any technical or craft instruction, nor could Kuwait's finances stand the establishment of a technical school. 3 # I told the Shaikh, speaking in a personal and .friendly way and not committing myself officially, that I would sound the Hon f ble the Political Resident and make enquiries as to the possibility of obtaining vacancies at a technical school abroad at fees which Kuwaitis would find within their means. 9 # i had in mind the technical schools of Palestine where the Hi^a Goramissioner might find it possible to arrange for vacancies at the lowest ratei? consonant ?fith expenses incurred in their trainirig and where any sudents sent would have the benefit of Briti di superintendence and assistance. 10/-10, In view of tlie probable future derelopment of Kuwait and its position on the Imperial Air Houte the problem v/ould seem to be worth attention from a political point of view, leaving aside the benefit to Kuwaitis which exercises my mind less. 11. Furthermore, companies developing here must have trained men and failing Kuwaitis will have to be allowed to import foreigners which will have an adverse effect on their relations here and tend to accentuate the feeling of inferiority and consequently the xenophobia ?7hich is never far below the surface in a country such as this coming for the first time in contact with a foreign and superior technique. lZ m I therefore feel that these are matters worth bringing to your attention; firstly the apparent urgent need for facilities for Kuwaitis to be trained at technical schools abroad after they have passed out of the iUmadlya or American Mission School and secondly that failing your instructions to the contrary some Syrian or Iraqi schoolmasters are likely to arrive here within the year. I attach in an appendix a list of the tradesmen #iich the Kuwait Oil Company has difficulty in finding or finds it impossible to obtain locally. I have added to this some other trades or professions in ?jhich Kuwaitis are or will be needed soon and against all I have placed a figure which represents the number which could be absorbed by the end of their training period. It is within the number which the State is likely to be able to send abroad and within the number of boys who would be qualified to go, that is having a knowledge of English, where it is necessary for their training, and who would benefit by training. The list is intended to be indicative only of the requirement srequirements and lias of course not been furnished by the Shaikh, irho would not feel it worth going into closely unless sorae nev/ proposition were made;, his former idea of sending boys abroad having been abandoned on the grounds of expense® I have the honour to be Your most obedient servant ;ain, \ Pol iti cal Agen t, Kuwai t ♦a p p xl xi D 1 .

Bushire, the 30th May 1956. Please refer to your interesting letter ^o.C-141 dated the 23rd April 1956 on the subject of Educational pioblems of Kuwait♦ g. My views are as follows and are based on my experience at Aden, where in addition to other duties I was for some time in charge of the schools, and where the educational problems are not unlike those of Kuwait, and also on a general interest in the subject of education. 3, There is more confused thinking about, more money wasted on, and more harm done by, f education 1 so-called than by almost any other form of human activity. What happens, for instance, in a 1 backward 1 State like Kuwait is that after centuries of practically no education at all, suddenly education is let go at full blast. There is a pathetic belief that book knowledge, especially book knowledge of some European language such as English, will cure all local ills, and the result often is that a large number of students are turned out for whom there are no suitable Jobs, These students not unnaturally become discontented and the foci of general unrest. 4. One advantage that Kuwait has is that the Shaikh can now start with an almost clean slate, and being a dictator can shape education as he likes. On how he shapes it in the next few years will depend largely ssaa the future of his State. Stage A. / aptain G.S.de Gaury, mc., Political Agent, Kuwait.5. / 7 Stage To begin at the bottom with the Koranic schools which you refer to in your paragraph 6« As far as I know pupils at these schools learn little beyond sayling the Koran or rather parts of it by heart# However, this is all to the good in so far as it teaches them their own religion at an impressionable age, and these schools Bight be kept on, though perhaps reduced in numbers, as, kindergarten schools for children up to 5 years of age ■ i 1 v; i or so. Stage B , The next stage should be to provide free for all , in Arabic.. young Kuwaitis simple instructions in tne tnree n* 1 In whatever way the boy will have to earn his daily bread when he grows up this knowledge will be of use to him e.g. a diver will be able to check his accounts and so be less in the hands of his employer. These schools might be presided over by the best of the present teachers in the Koranic schools, and the age of the pupils might be from 5 to 8 or 10 years. Stage C . The next stage might be for boys from about 10 years upwards who intend to learn English. Such boys should continue their instruction^ in Arabic and begin to learn simple English. From this stage upwards it is arguable that education should not be free but paid for. I do not think it is much use for boys who will ordinarily earn their living as divers etc. being given a knowledge of English, Stage D . This would improve the further education for boys \ under Stage C. In order to provide for la carriere ouverte aux talent s the Shaikh might give a few free scholar ships to specially promising students from Stage B to C and upwards.5, So much for ay general ideas on Kuwait education. With regard to the specific points raised in your letter I agree with you and the Bhaikh that Syrian masters would be preferable to Iraai ones, Wnat about Palestinian ones ? Whoever they are they will have to be carefully chosen end should ropresent quality rather then quantity, i.e. as a beginning it would be better to have a few well paid and good ones rather than many and indifferently paid, 6« With regard to technical education I quite agree in its importance, and think the idea of sending Kuwaitis to the ^ Z. technical school in Palestine is a good one - vide paragraph 9 of your letter* Will you please write to the scholastic authorities there, sending me a copyjof your letter, stating that I have asked you to make necessary enquiries* When their reply has been received the Shaikh will be able to decide how many students can be sent there* ?• It is 6'f course for the Shaikh to decide on what lines general education in Kuwait should follow, but you might inform him, verbally and informally, of my views as given at ve and let me Know what he thinks* f'c f / F*S * I find on reading through the above that I have missed out a most imp rtant item in my educational programme* In addition to purely *educaticmal* knowledge the young Kuwaiti should be given some sort of 1 moral 1 trainingi he should grow up a good citizen as #ell as an educated one*goiy?id2:;'i^.

As the matter has now become rather pressing we do not wish to delay longer, 2, lluwait is facing the problem of 'Sducation' and for various reasons is inclined to turn to Palestine. 5, There are two distinct problems: (a) technical train ing of boys abroad, (b) Schoolmasters for the simpler type of school in Kuwait. At present tbere are 42 Koranic Schools and two preliminary schools and it is hoped to open something a little more advanced and wtiich would include the teaching of liinglish to some boys# 4, v /ith regard to (a), we want to find vacancies for somewhere about the number shown in the appendix to this letter The State is still poor although hoping for an income from Oil; our first bore well having reached 3000 feet already. Is it possible that His I&amp;ccellency would permit students of this State (which is under British protection) to be taken in any Palestine technical training establishment which may have suitable vacancies and at the lowest possible charges consonant with expenses?

The climate here for some months in the year is far from good and quite young men are more suitable than older for that reason and as being more adaptable and likely to fit in with other local conditions different to those in Palestine. 12.

Dated the 11th October^S. Edueation is raore and more a matter of first interest to the people of this ^tate. Preliminary edueation of a limited number of boys having been much improved by the Palestinian masters, who have been employed for the last three years, there now arises the problem of higher education leading up to University work. 2, Iraq has offered five free vacancies in her schools, which have just been accepted for five poor scholars, but vacancies for some of the sons of notables, able to afford moderate fees, and for other poor scholars are required. 3, From what I have seen of the results of Iraqi education I deplore the idea that any more Kuwait boys should go to Bagdad. There is inculcated, not a healthy patriotism, but what I can only call a 'half-baked', anti-British, and virulent, nati onali sm # 4# I believe that the matter of the higher education of Kuwait boys - and probably those from other Gulf States, is not only important to them, but to us for Political reasons, and I therefore suggest that consideration should be given to bespeaking vacancies at Victoria College, Alexandria, and/or the Beirut American University, to be at your disposal for a small number of boys whom you would nominate, the number being say five at one time. The expenses might I think be covered by a comparatively low sum, well worth the results which would be achieved. Jo^ble Lt-Golonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.l. ,C.B.S. , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Gamp at Ku*f4lT. ^ r2- 5. Certainly the cost of eduoating a boy at the American School in Beirut is extremely little, I hear about £.4S/- a year only and it would be suitable for the poorer scholars. Victoria college, a Queen Victoria Memorial School, with a British Board, one of whom is I think the British Consul General in Alexandria, and with a British Headmaster, is probably more expensive. On the other hand, being what it is, and with a number of English boys in the School, it would be preferable to the American school for the sons of notables. The Board of Victoria College might I suppose consider reducing fees to meet the wishes of Government, provided that they could be assured of a definite number of boys for some time, although I do not propose this as an indefinite scheme# The great thing is to start the right fashion, which might be done for Kuwait, in ten years by sending two boys to Victoria college, and three to Beirut, and maintaining that number in both Schools for that period. It would in any case be less costly than establish ing a British Arabic School at Cyprus as, I understand, has been suggested, or sending boys to England; as Italy sends Arab youths for free education in Italy.70 b'V Confidential , BUSH1RE RESIDENCY. . - Prom Date..-- ' ''cONnOO^TlAL RECORDS Political Agent, Kuwait # To Political Resident,.Buskire.

I wrote in the first 'As education goes in the Arabian Peninsula , the standard is quite high. At least every boy and nearly every girl, goes to school, if only a Koranic school, and those with aptitude, can go on to one of the three higher grade schools. In one of these there are employed four Palestinian school masters (approved as suitable by the Secretariat of the High Commissioner in Palestine, before being appointed in 1937.) who teach English and more advanced work than the local The Honourable Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.2., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E.-2- local school masters^ In addition a number of paid teachers of English, Indians and others, spread the knowledge of that language. n Since writing the above the number of Palestinian masters in the three Kuwait Government schools has been doubled, and they have under them over 375 boys, while two Palestinian school mistresses teach in the new Government girl school. The number of Koranic schools, for very small boys, S5, remains the same, while the number of private preparatory schools is three. As the number of boys has considerably increases this year, the Education Department is contempleltiug the employment of a qualified Headmaster to deal with all the four schools, in place of the present acting one, who has been found to be below the standard requiredo 2. The curriculum in the Kuwait Grovernment schools is intended to give a 'Secondary** education, as that term is understood in the Middle East, but in fact the standard is rather lower than that elsewhere, because the schools have only recently started up, and the students are rather less well grounded before they enter the school. It is particularly weak on the English side because the Palestinian masters, while they do speak English, are not really good at it. The books in use are those used in Iraqi schools, except that the English books are from the 'Oxford University Press tt ; having been brought by the Palestinian masters from Palestine. All the books are paid for by the students with the exception of some very poor boys who are supplied with books free of charge by the Department.No fees are charged for boys, but girls have to pay Rs»2/- monthly. From next year the girls also will be given free education. The total income of the Education Department is Rs.49,000/- per annum, half being contributed by the Landing Department, and the other half being a special tax for this purpose of t 1° on incoming goods. All of this sum is needed for the existing Educational programme. 3. The general aptitude of the boys is most encouragingly and surprisingly high. In spite of few opportunities in the past Kuwaitis have educated themselves in a remarkable way® Many of the younger merchants conduct business with India and England in English, while the Residency Agent at Sharja, and I think the majority of your vernacular staff in the G-ulf are Kuwaitis. Good manners and absence of crime in Kuwait are most noticeable. It therefore seems fertile educational ground, 4o The present situation is that about 18 boys have passed out of the G-over-nment schools and are ready now for further education, which cannot be provided in Kuwait, leading up to lower standard University, or technical edcuation, and more, and better trained boys, will be coming on every year. Five of these have already been sent to the Baghdad Training Gollege; the Iraq Government having volunteered to take them there free. Other Kuwaiti boys being educated abroad, at the expense of their parents, are as follows;~ 8 Beirut. 10 Iraq. 1 al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia. 8 India (children of parents living in India).BC&gt; -4~ 5. As you will see Iraq is already taking a dominant part in the education of the most intelligent Kuwait youths. In 1926 the British iSmbassy evinced an interest in the education of Kuwaiti youths, and in addition, the Ambassador made verbal enquiries from the Shaikh, and from the Agency, about the 'lack of education in Kuwait' of which he had been informed, no doubt by Qovernment circles, in Baghdad® 6. I pointed out the danger of Iraqi 'culture' in ^ p-lg my letter No.0-325 of 11th October# Only recently there has been a violent demonstration in the Iraqi Capital by uncontrolled schoolboys, which, in any case, cannot be called a suitable retreat for studbixub. The crime Statistics of Baghdad, if truthfully recorded, must be some of the highest in the world. It has toeen a Press which violently attacks authority, occasional coup# d^tat, and is unusually noisy and dusty. I would therefore emphasize my recommendation, to which I shall revert below, that the question of higher 'secondary' education i.e. intermediate between the Kuwait advanced schools and (a) lower standard University or (b) technical schools, should be given our consideration and at least Governments benevolent assistance, if not some slight financial support, which I believe it merits; and that the initiative should not be left by us to the Iraq G-ovemment# 7. ^or intelligent poor boys the education should of course be technical, not merely 'liberal'. With regard to the actual number of boys requiring technical education i.e. who can readily31 readily be absorbed by the Kxrwait Oil Company and local enterprises, please see para 4 of my letter No.352 of 1st November, 1938, which I quote below for ready reference• The most needed workmen at present are (a) Motor Mechanics. (b) Electrical Mechanics. (c) Master Masons# (d) Master Carpenters. (e) Wireless Operators. About three vacancies are required in each category. Trained Stenographers and Typists will also be needed. As I have said, there is need for all of these, to have further secondary education, before they can enter a technical school. Even when this additional work has been done, where are the boys to go for their technical training? - i.e. to be carried out in the English, or/and Arabic languages. 8. India, from this, the educational, point of view, has, I regret, less appeal to Kuwaiti Arabs than hitherto and their eyes are naturally turned, in these days of what is called ^the Arab Renaissance', to the West, to Arabia and the Middle East 'Arab' Countries. The ideal would be to have higher standard local schools, and a minor University and Technical College in the Persian Gulf, but there is, I presume, little hope of that, and in any case some time would be required to start such establishments^ so, for the immediate future, it must be to the Middle Eastern Countries that we must look. 9. I take them in turn. (a)(a) Palestine can be of no help to us© I attach a copy of the Palestine Secretariat letter on the subject No©OF/?52/36 of 17th December, 1936^ (b) Iraq has Secondary Schools, Training Colleges | and a Technical Training school, and would probably be pleased to offer vacancies, but is it desirable that we should encourage Kuwaitis to take them up? As I have indicated above Baghdad has distinct disadvantages as an educational centre^ (c) Then there is Sgypt, I think perhaps that the British Embassy in Cairo could help us to find suitabU 4 secondary coaching establishments, and Technical Schools of not too high a standard, at not too high, a cost for Kuwait boys, although a disadvantage is the distance from Kuwait. The fact that the Shaikh has an Agent there, who could keep an eye on the boys might be an offset to this disadvantage in the eyes of some parents. 10, It is little use to ^drive' the Kuwait educatior. Department into making enquiries, and producing the money. They have little 'drive', are almost quite ignorant of the outside world, except that of Iraq, which occasionally thrusts itself upon them, and have so far few resources. There is, however, I understand increasing interest being shown in British-foreign cultural relations, and an organization known as the British Council, under, I believe, the direction of Lord Lloyd and Mr. Harold Nicholson, provides English masters in Iraq, about £ 1,000 annually for Iraqi students in England, etc. The staff of that organization may also be able to help us if we consult them. 11 # Apart from technical education there also remains the easier question of the higher education52&gt; ~7~ eduoation of boys for non-technical employment, mostly the sons of the Ruling family destined for administra tive posts, and no doubt, in one way and another, contact with foreigners. IE. My recommendations for the future are therefore as follows. NQN-TECHNICAL EDUCATION . I think we should (a) if possible, secure reduced ; fees for the sons of some of the less well off members . of the Ruling family, at Victoria College, Alexandria, and (b) encourage the Shaikh himself to send his sons there. If we fail in (a) and the parents agreed, we could fall back on the American University, Beirut, but Victoria College is a British establishment, from I which we can make preliminary confidential enquiries, without necessarily consulting beforehand the Shaikh, or the prospective parents# The number of boys under this heading (a) above, would be approximately 4 at one time. (c) TECHNICAL EDUCATION . The number now requiring further education prior to a Technical training, the most difficult problem, is as has been said above, approximately 18. | We should, I think secure immediately, with the Shaikh* s agreement, a (British) English master to undertake education of this class of boys in English up to a standard which will enable them to enter a Technical school. A man of the right character would I have no doubt soon be consulted by the Kuwaitis, and the Agency, on all local educational problems, but his first task should be the English and advanced class. We should in this, I suggest,-8- 3t|^ I suggest, seek the financial aid and the advice of the British Council, and subsequently obtain their aid in the selection of a Technical College as soon as the first boys are ready for it. If part of the cost of such an appointment were borne by the British Council the Kuwait aovernment could I think be persuaded to pay part, up to the amount which they would have to pay for say an Egyptian or other educated oriental master^ FUTURE POLICY, 13. Apart from the immediate and pressing problems, we should, in ray opinion, also have a long term policy for Kuwait, in this matter of education. It is not necessary to be an over-liberal Fairy Gk)d-mother, but we should at least be a calculating parent, and my personal view is that a well-found British-guided Minor University and Technical College, with low fees, established here (because of the climate , its intelligent inhabitants, and its particularly fertile educational ground),' or in Bahrain (where Kuwaitis could go) will have in the long run a powerful effect for future good in the Persian G-ulf, and in Eastern and Saudi Arabia. Even some of the better class Iraqis, who find Victoria College too far away, might in time send their sons to such a College® A British master, such as I have suggested above in para 12, could no doubt put up a detailed proposition on this subject, when he had had time to study the position on the spot.Copy of letter No .CJ/752/36, dated 19th December, 1936, from the Palestine Secretariat, Jerusalem to the Political Agency, Kuwait. vu&gt;4' Please refer to my letter CB , /752/36 of 30th October, 1936 regarding inter alia the technical training of boys from Kuwait in Palestine* 2, It does not appear after examination of the question that we can be very helpful to you in this matter# There are three institutions which come under consideration for this prupose: (i) the Trade School of the Moslem Orphanage at tTerusalenu This institution offers only carpentry cabinet making and shoema&amp;ing# (ii) Schneller's Orphanage at Jerusalem, This institution trains motor mechanics and fitters but as a Christian missionary ,institution it may be considered unsuitable by the Kuwait authoMMes. (iii) the G-overnment Trade School at Haifa* It is not yet known when this will be opened. It will probably provide training in the first year after opening for carpentry and fitters only. During the first two years there will not be a full complement of Palestinian students Thereafter the entire accommodation will be required for Palestinians. The f&amp;Ll course is three years and it follows that foreigners admitted for the first two years cannot complete a full course. If this difficulty can be overcome we should require evidence that the proposed students from Kuwait have:3^7 . (a) a complete elementary education comparable with that provided in Palestine; (b) an adequate knowledge of Inglisho No pupil, Palestinian or foreign, can be admitted who does not satisfy these conditions and it seems unlikely that boys from Kuwait will prove eligible for entry#fs/ff 3-| Confident ial, D. O.HO*231-3, The Residency, Bu3hire # the 21at March, 1959. f lc [..vl I enclose herewith an interesting and most informatiTe letter, 10.0-34, dated the 16th January 1939, on Kuwait education from de Gaury. I have been meaning to forward it with my comments before now, but while Kuwait remained in a disturbed condition I had other and more urgent Cuwait i problems to deal with, low that Kuwait has, I hope, settled down, #e can consider the subject of its education. 2. I need hardly emphasise the importance of education at Kuwait (as well as at the other Arab States of the Oulf) from our point of view as well as that of the States. On the type and quality of the education will largely depend whether the young Kuwaiti of the future will beccfcae a good citizen, or a discontented agitator, a thorn in the fleah of the Shaikh and of ourselves. Youth Movements, and the like, as you are aware, have already begun to show themselves in Kuwait, fanned by Iraqi propaganda# On the other hand as de Gaury points out - vide paragraph 3 of his letter - Cuwaiti youths can compare favour ably with the youths of the neighbouring States, especially Iraq, and afford fertile educational ground. 3. I agree with de Gaury • vide his paragraph 1 • that, as education goes in the Arabian Peninsula, the standard at i &amp;wait is quite high. In considering its Improvement the first essential is to try and avoid in Kuwait an educational system, such as exists elsewhere, which will turn out students for whom / there .T.Peel Esquire, If.C., The India Office, Xondon,3? m there are no auitable openinge. Having worked in order to acquire an education auch youths are naturally diagrantled when they find that this education is apparently of little use to them, while haTine been educated they are disinclined to earn their living by manual labour. I a® afraid that it will be imposBible to avoid turning out some such disgruntled young men, but at any rate we can try and reduce this number to a minimum by encouraging technical education* 4. the difficulty is that there are no facilities for this technical education in Kuwait, and even if these were provided cojld only be on a very small scale, facilities exist next door in Iraq both for technical as well as for other education, but I entirely agree with de Gaury - vide paragraph 6 of his letter - that it is distinctly undesirable that Kuwaiti boys and young men should acquire their education in the subversive and anti-British atmosphere of Iraq* On the other hand as Iraq has the great advantage of being so near to Kuwait» it is only 4 hours by car from Kuwait to Basra, I am afraid that it will be impossible to prevent Kuwaiti youths going there, at all events to finish off their education, more especially as the Iraqis are fully alive to the advantage of getting Kuwaiti youths educated in Iraq and have offered them - as pointed out by de Gaury in his paragraph 4 - five free vacancies in the Bagdad Training college. 5^ Although we may have to resign ourselves to a certain number of Xuwaiti youths finishing their education in Iraq, there is no reason why we should not attempt to make education in Kuwait itself as useful as possible and to try and innoculate the boys with pro-British ideas against Iraqi influence# I agree with de Gaury - vide his paragraph 12 { c) - that we might try and / secure3 secure a Britiah achoolmaater to undertake the education of the boys in sngliah up to a standard which will enaoie them to enter a technical school. Jailing a British schoolmaster, «ho it may be difficult to obtain, a good ^rab schoolmaster with a tharough knowledge of mglish might be secured. In either case this master could, in addition to his teaching worK, also undertake the important functions of a local director of Jdueation. 6. As far aa higher eduoation outaide Kuwait is concerned I am strongly of opinion that we should not leave the field entirely open to the Iraqis, and I agree with de Oaury - Tide his paragraphs 10 and 12 (c) - that we might ask the British Council whether they would be prepared to give financial assist ance to a number of boys to be educated, perhaps at the Victoria College, Alexandria# which seems a suitable Institution# 7. I am visiting 'Cuwait it the end of next month and all discuss the matter further with de Ga *ry and the 3ha* ch« In the meantime I would be grateful if the India Office could make enquiries as to met her the British Council could see their way to assisting Kuwait in the manner suggested. It would certainly have an excellent effect on the Hhaikh and in Kuwait generally if I could inform the Shaikh during my visit that the reply is in the affirmative, or at all events that the Council are giving the matter their sympathetic consideration# «• I am sending a copy of this letter with enclosure to Metcalfe and, without, to de (Jaury, r * sent under Printed letter No.232-3 of the 21st March, 1939.B y Air Mail.

A matter which seems to me to need consideration in this connection is the Shiah education of Kuwait. There is, as you know, a Shiah school with some 200 hoys attending. The 'boys are all sons of the Persian element of the Town, and as such are likely to make better artisans than Arah 'boys do. The school receives no income from the Kuwait State, and, 'beyond having given an initial donation, the Government do not seem to take any interest in the school. The running of it is left to the Shiah Mullahs. I think the school should he left outside our scheme of improvements for we can only concern ourselves with State schools. It is a pity, for the most likely material as regards eventual efficiency in labour will come from the Persian section. By leaving out the Shiahs, what we are setting out to do is to change the leopards spots, when we already have leopards with the right coloured spots. However, I don f t see how we can help it. There is a possibi lity that the school may close down soon from lack of funds, when if the boys are taken into the State school so much the better. Though there is not much likelihood of that for reasons of religious antipathy. 7. Vallance's visit caused a flutter in the Kuwait dove cote and was, I hear, viewed with apprehension from some quarters. I must say Yallance put his back into his work while/ para 7 ,t&gt;'T paras 8 and 9,-5' while lie was here, yet conducted himself tactfully. The result was a successful visit. The question of what remunera' tion to ask from the Shaikh remains. Would £ 35/- he consi dered a reasonable sum? £ 50/- were suggested for Bahrain, vide Houstoun-Boswall's letter Ho. 309/12/3$' of 'the 25th Hay, 1939. &lt;1°**'A' Kuwait, 28th 1939 Dear Major Galloway, I have now insoeeted the four Government schools of Kuwait - the Mubarakiya School in more detail than the others - and I 'beg to submit a 'brief report of what I have found, 2. I can 'begin 'by saying that my general impression of the schools of Kuwait is a very pleasant one. There was a happy atmosphere ahout them all, which is always a good sign. 3. The 'buildings in which the schools are housed are fairly satisfactory. They are clean, and in fairly good repair, j The quality of the teaching which is given inside the buildings is of course much more important than the quality of the 'buil dings themselves. 4. Much of the school equipment, chiefly the desks used 'by the 'boys, was in need of renewal or repair, and I was told that this work would be done during the holidays. 5. As regards the staff, I think the Government has 'been wise to engage Palestinian teachers, rather than Egyptians, Syrians, or Iraqis, and in my opinion great credit is due to the Palestinian Headmaster for the improvements which he has effected in Education in Kuwait during the past three years. Most of the assistant masters seemed to he competent men, anri i was parti cularly impressed hy the efficiency and enthusiasm of the young Palestinian master who is in charge of the Boy Scouts. 6. The hoys appeared to he well-disciplined, and, on the whole, well-taught. They were bright and intelligent, especially those in the lower classes. They were certainly more healthy than the 'boys of the Government schools in Bahrain. Their clothes, however, were not so clean. | 7. The higher and middle classes of the schools were of about the right sizes, but the babies* classes were too large, and I shall refer to these lower classes later on in this reDort.8. The standard of education reached at Kuwait is not as high as that reached 'by some of the other Arah States. There are, in my opinion, a number of ways in which it could 'be improved, and these I will enumerate. 9. The first and most important thing to rememb er when we are trying to Educate children is that there can 'be no sound education without sound physical health. What is most urgently needed in the schools is a School Doctor. By this I do not near a doctor who would attend to the health of the schools in addition to some other work: I mean one who would work solely among the children. If the Government cannot afford such a doctor, then they should offer a reasonable salary to some doctor who has very little other work to do. it should he the duty of the appointed doctor to visit all the schools every day, and to visit those children who are absent from school owing to illness. He should keep individual records of the health and development of every school child, and make himself personally responsible for their physical health throughout the whole of their school life. The doctor appointed should he a man specially qualified to treat the diseases of the eye. He should personally lecture to all the children in all the schools on matter of health, and about the necessity of having disease of all kinds treated in its earliest stage, and not left until it is too late; and the children should be taught tha t, this advice refers especially to eye-diseases. The doctor appointed should be the kind of man who^ is able to win the confidence of children, so that instead of trying to evade him they will come to him of their own freewill to see his help, if we wish child ren to make the proper use of doctors we must educate them in these matters, just as in any other matters, and we must provide them with doctors of whom they will not be frightened. It was pitiful to see in the schools of Kuwait many little boys who have lost or who are losing their eyesight, simply because there was nobody to attend to the trouble in its early stages, or to warn them of the danger of neglecting disease. Blinft and half--3- 'blind people are of little value to any State, and I suggest tiiat any money spent now on providing a school doctor in Kuwait would 'be repaid many times over, in the form of healthierjl men and women, in the coming years. I consider the provision of a school doctor to 'be the most pressing of all the necessary school reforms. \ / j 10. The next thing I ought to mention is the necessity of cultivsating in the school-children a proper feeling of patrio- j tism, and 'by this I mean a patriotic feeling for Kuwait, rather than for the Arah world as a whole. I was sorry to find many j of the 'boys, at all the four schools, using exercise hooks which 'bore on their covers the portrait of a foreign ruler and the name oi a foreign State. This should he absolutely forbidde)! and if any portrait is to he placed on the school exercise hooks' it should he that of the Shaikh of Kuwait. I was glad to find that there is a National Song, composed hy a Kuwaiti, anri learnt and sung in the schools: hut there is no History of Kuwait in us e there, and this defect ought to he remedied at once. A commission should he given to some competent person to I write, for an^greed fee, aschool history-hook, dealing only with! th e htsto ry of Kuwait, and the smallest hoys should he taught the history of Kuwait before they hegin to learn any other history; for this reason the hook should he written in an ^ extremely simple style, suitable for the lowest classes in the schools/' we cannot expect to find the full measure of patrio- ) tism in our subjects unless we have taken some steps to foster j patriotism in them while they are still children at school.K U. While we are speaking of patriotism I should like to touch upon the Question of school clothes. The Headmaster of the four ' . _ | schools tells me that little by little he is trying to persuade the boys to wear Buropean clothes/ rather than Arab clothes, and that when he occasionally gives out free clothes to poor boys at the school he gives them European clothes. I am sure this is a Very sreat mistake. Arab clothes are beautim and dignified.-4« they have 'been worn unchanged for many centuries, and they have 'been found 'by long experience to 'be the most suitable clothes for the climates in which the Ara'bs have to live. The hoys of Kuwait should Ijet 'be taught to despise the costume of their ancestors. On the contrary, they should 'be taught to respect them, to keep them clean, and to wear them with grace and pride. They need not 'be afraid that not much will 'be thought of them unless they dress themselves like Europeans: the English especailly admire peoples who retain their national costumes and remain proud of them. 12. My next recommendation refers to the education of the Atfal, or infants. In all Eastern countries it seems to 'be the practice to allot all the 'best teachers to the oldest 'boys and the worst teachers to the 'beginners. This is the worst mistake that could 'be made, for the first few years of a child's education are far more important than any others. It is during these years that he learns neatness, method, correct ways of thinking, application, and so on; and we invariably find that we cannot teach 'boys successfully in the middle and upper class^ es of a school, or lead them to higher educational levels, unless they possess the sound foundation which is the only 'basis upon which the higher teaching can 'be 'built. In any school the 'best teachers should always 'be given to the youngest hoys. But I want to recommend in the case of Kuwait something even further than this: I want to recommend that no 'bahies • classes should any longer 'be carried on in any of the existing schools (which contain 'boys of 18 and even 20 years of age), 'but that a special Preparatory School should 'be created, and that all children who are receiving their first three years of education should 'be sent to this school and to no other. And it is of the utmost importance that only the 'best- qualified and hest and imsst patient of the teachers should 'be allowed to teach in this school, which should 'be the 'best-equip ped, and which should 'be considered the most important, of all the schools in the State. If this suggestion is carried out,' the result will 'be, in a few years* time, a very marked improve ment in the educational standards of all the classes in the other schools; and if the Kuwait Government really wishes to improve the standard of education in the State, it will hest and most quickly he ahle to do so 'by starting at the 'bottom of the educational system, and not at the top. 13. The next two suggestions refer to the teaching of Arith metic and of English, and they are made in view of the fact that j 'before very long the Oil Company is likely to have a number of well-paid posts to offer to hoys and young men who are of sufficient educational standard to fill them. The standard of Arithmetic possessed hy the Kuwait school hoys is not high enouglj to make them of much value to the Oil Company, or as Government 1 or business clerks. If the standard is not improved in the near future, we shall see all the better-paid posts going to foreign ers, instead of to local men, and this will lead to dissatisfac tion and grievances on the part of the State's subjects, as it has done in the past in Bahrain and other places. The Govern ment would be wise to obtain immediately the services of a realljl good teacher of Mathematics, and to put him in charge of all the mathematical teaching at all the schools - that is to say, to put all the other Arithmetic teachers under his orders, and to give him definite instructions to raise the whole standard of Arithmetic in the schools by introducing modem methods of teaching, and by personally supervising the work. This teacher should as soon as he arrives get into touch with Major Galloway, with a view to finding out from him exactly what is required by the Company in the way of Mathematics. 14. The teaching of English in the Mubarakiyah school is good and sound as far as it goes, but it does not go very far. The boys have a good knowledge of the language within the narrow | limits of the simple tezt-books which they are using, but nothing more; and this is not enough for an Oil Company's requirements. The best thing to do would be to employ a competent Englishman to teach the top classes; but if this cannot be afforded the-yv the existing masters should he urged to take their hoys to much higher levels than those at which they are now studying. 15. I must draw the attention of the Governnent to the question of* the handwriting of the 'boys in the Government schools. The handwriting, 'both in Arabic and in English, 'but especially in English, is 'bad; and this is a pity, 'because for centuries it has 'been an Arabic tradition to write 'beautifully, and 'by English people had handwriting is considered to he a sign of low culture and low education. This means that an Arah 'boy who writes 'badly will never he ahle to fill a post as a Government, Bank, or 'business clerk, which is the object of many of the hoys in the Kuwait schools. The reason for the had hand writing is that in teaching writing the schools do not make use of copy hooks; the hoys learn to write 'by the method of copying what their teachers have written on the hlackhoard, or 'by imitating the letters in printed hooks. This is all wrong. I recommend that all the lower classes in all the schools should learn to write Arabic from proper copy-hooks, and that all the English classes should have regular practice in handwriting from jj English copy-hooks. I have already told the Headmaster which are the hest English copy hooks to use, and as for the Arabic ones, as there are now many different styles of Arabic hand writing represented in the available copy-books, I suggest that a number of specimens be shewn to the Shaikh, and that he should decide which style of Arabic handwriting is traditional in Luwait, or best suited to the needs of the Kuwait boys. The teachers who are selected by the Headmaster to teach handwriting ' to the infants should be specially and very carefully selected from men who are themselves good at handwriting and at freehand drawing. 16. There is another cause of the bad handwriting in the | schools. This is the use of pencils instead of ink. I recommendf that all the boys should be accustomed to the use of ink from an early age, and that after they leave the lower classes they ,73 7- they should never 'be allowed to use pencils at all. Writing with pencils is unknown in English schools. 17. I should like to mention the question of regular attendance on the part of the hoys at the schools. We cannot properly educate 'boys if their attendance is spasmodic or irregular. I recommend that each of the schools should employ a special farash who would act as an attendance officer, and who would make it his duty each day to know the true cause of absence of every 'boy who has 'been marked absent on the atten dance roll. I do not think that the average parent would reseii &gt; the visits of such a man to their houses for this purpose, for j it very often happens that the parent is quite unaware that his son is absenting himself from school, and is grateful for 'being j told about it. In any case, we should always consider the efficiency of the schools before the feelings of the parents. 18. A few words ahout the Mubarakiya school. There is a tendency to look upon this school as 'being much more important I thali the others, simply because the Mubarakiya has a few classes of higher standard than are provided at the other schools. The result of this view of the Mubarakiya is that the 1 other schools are to some extent neglected. lor example, there is not a single Palestinian teacher in any of the schools except the Mubarakiya , and every one of the 100 Boy Scouts which have been enrolled is a Mubarakiya boy. This discrimi nation between the schools is a great mistake, arnj if it is allowed to continue it will destroy the corporate feeling which | ought to exist between all the Government schools. The three smaller schools should be regarded as the feeders of the larger one, and therexore as being equally important; and the teaching at the smaller schools should most certainly be just as good as that provided in the Mubarakiya. 19. I feel that there is much the same kind of discrimina tion between the Palestinian and the Kuwaiti teachers, in the matter of salaries. In my opinion the salaries of the Kuwaitis'8- n- are too far 'below those of the Palestinians, even if we remem- 'ber that the Palestinians have their travelling expenses to provide for, and that their cost of living (at Kuwait) is higher than that of the local men. I think it would 'be fair to j make some small increase in salary for the benefit of the local teachers. 20. I also feel that the salary of the Headmaster is too low,i when we consider that he is responsible for all the activities of all the four schools, and that he has in three years effected a tremendous improvement in the educational affairs of Kuwait. Perhaps the Government might see their way towards recognising financially the Headmaster's past services. 21. I think it would 'be wise on the part of the Government, when engaging new teachers, to engage men who have received all their education in Palestine, at Government schools, and who have not served as teachers in any countries outside of Pales tine. The Government schools of Palestine are well conducted, on English lines, and we should try in Kuwait to get the 'benefit of this, 'by engaging masters who have known no other systems of education. 22# gilialI y&gt; a s regards political activities in the schools. Education has nothing to do with politics, and it is not desira ble that either schoolboys or schoolmasters should concern them selves with political matters. Warnings should be given from time to time in the schools that any political activities on the part of either masters of boys will lead to expulsion from the school, and this rule should be rigidly enforced. 23. The above are my recoiiinendations for the well-being, improvement, and future success of Government education in Kuwait: but I ought to add that while visiting the schools I noticed many minor deficiencies which the Headmaster told me had formed the subject of repeated applications by himself to the authorities, without result. These minor deficiencies, though not sufficiently important in themselves for inclusion in fin this report, wlien added together form a sum-total whioh seriously interferes with the full efficiency of the schools; and I therefore think that it would 'be wise to ask the Shaikh to issue his personal order to those responsible for the upkeep of the school buildings and property that reasonable applica tions by the Headmaster concerning school matters should receive prompt attention. 24. Having now finished my description of the things which I have seen in Kuwait, I may perhaps be excused if I say a few words about something which I have not seen, but which will shortly have to be provided if Kuwait is to become one of the centres of the oil industry. I mean Technical Education. There is at present nothing of the kind at Kuwait, and those boys who wish eventually to obtain technical posts with the Oil company ought to be beginning their technical training now. I do not know what are the intentions of the Government in this i matter, but the building and equipment of even a small technical 1 school is an expensive matter, and I do not know whether it can be afforded at Kuwait or not. If not, I suggest that the Bahrain Government be approac hed, very soon, for permission to send a small number of carefully selected Kuwaiti boys to the Bahrain Government Technical school. Application might also be successfully made to the Oil Company for financial help in this matter. I have seen the Bahrain Technical school at work, and was very favourably impressed by it. It Is under the control of an Englishman, and has an atmosphere of work and efficiency which would provide an excellent preliminary training for young Kuwaitis who wish later on to enter the Oil Company's employ. You will remember that in the discussion which we had with Scott about employment with the Company he stressed the absolute! necessity of a high standard of working discipline amongst the youthful employees. But the most important t hing to remember is that technical education takes time, and that therefore we should make a start with the training of the boys now, and not wait until after ihe Company has begun to produce oil, when it-10' it will 'be too late, 25, I think I have now said all that I can usefully say alxmt the education here, and it only remains for me to thank the P.S, through yourself, for having asked me to undertake the work, to say what a pleasure it has 'been to do it, and to thank 'both him and yourself for the great hospitality you have shewn me throughout my stay in Kuwait, Believe me. Yours sincerely, Sd. O.B.L. Adrian- Vallance.r*B»» Copy of a private letter dated E9th June 1939 from Mr.C.R.L. Adrian-Tallance, to Major A.C.Galloway f Political Agent,Kuwait. We agreed tjbat I should write, for private use, a supplementary note to the Import on Education which I have just submitted, the purpose of the Hote being to enable me to give you any useful information which it would not be tactful to convey to the Shaikh, for fear of damping his genuine enthusiasm for education, or too harshly disappointing his belief that the standard here is a high one # 2. Most fortunately, all the nice things nhich 1 have saic in the Report I have been able to say quite honestly® These people really are trying to put up a good show in education, and they really do believe that their standrad is high» This of course is an illusion* The Arab simply does not realise how low his educational standards are, and it is only when those standards come up against an acid test (in this case the very modest mathematical requirements of the oil company) that the real truth is suspected. 5. Perhaps I could best sum up the educational situation in Kuwait by saying that while the existing state of affairs is very creditable to the present Palestinian management, it would be highly discreditable to any Englishman who might be occupying the same position^ 4. The Final Examinations just held here are a good example of what is going on» I saw some of the question-papers, and they were set on the usual childish Eastern method, which ensures that the candidates will pass, even if they know next to nothing. The marking of the papers done by the boys was on the same plan. 5. What is really wanted here, of course, is a British director or inspector of education who really knows his job # Under such a man the present staff, plus one or two replacements or/-7« or newcomers, would be good enough, and the standard could be raised considerably. The only thing wanted is a bit of British drive, to counteract Arab inertia. In view of the wealth that is coming, and the changes which that wealth will bring, I should advise you to get an Englishman if you can; for there is bound to be a great increase in the number of schoolchildren as soon as the money-flow begins, and then there will be a greater muddle than ever in the schools. As far as one can reasonably calculate, only about one child in six is being educated at present. 7 # Another thing which you ought to try to do fairly soon is to make an arrangement, or gentleman's agreement, with the Oil Company, under the terms of which they would refuse to employ any young Kuwaiti of school a05 unless he could produce either a Grovernment certificate of sufficient education, or a certificate that he could never reach any higher standard than his existing one, and could therefore be employed immediately. Belgrave and I tried this at Bahrain, and a little to my surprise the oil company agreed at oace. The oniy ^snag' to such an arrangement, unless you have a British director of education, is that the certificates of sufficient education will be given (under pressure, influence, etc) to boys who doft 1 1 deserve them. 8 # Things would not be too bad here, really, if it wefe not for the fact that the oil is coming. That will raise many new problems, amongst which eduaction is sure to figure prominently. 9 # I think this is all I can usefully add to the Report, which is of course composed in a very simple style, with a view to its translation into Arabic.Confidential .

I must admit that 'before I had discussed with Scott and Yallance Technical Education, I had iDut a very hazy idea of what the term meant when reduced to hard facts. It appears that the term Technical Education includes three separate degrees of training. I hope I am not 'being redundant, hut it is necessary to 'be clear. The first is (a) the academic meaning of Technical Educa tion, i.e. the combination of theory and practice, then (h) can he conveniently classed as the preparation of Artisans and (c) the preparation of skilled labour. 3. Neither Scott as the potential employer, nor Vallance as the educational expert thinks that there would he any value to Kuwait in pursuing (a) yet. The Shaikh told me that there were four 'boys whom he would like to send to a Technical College in Egypt to 'be trained as teachers. He promised to write to me on the subject 'but has not done so, and, as Yallance told me that any movement in that direction would 'be abortive owing to the low standard of education here, I have not reopened the subject, 4. The pursuit of (h) we think is probably most likely/ ion f ble Sir Trenchard S'owle, KCIS., OBE., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.-2- 1/ likely to produce permanent tangible results in Kuwait, 'but Scott thinks that to act in that cLirection at the moment is early. To set up an estahlishment to teach artisan apprentices is a costly affair, am a scheme could not he settled on before the Kuwait Oil prospects are more definite. Vallance is of the opinion that the standard of education of the hoys in the Kuwaiti Schools is too low at the age required - the hoys have to he caught young, ahout 14 - to warrant a start on (h), though with efficient supervision, the material, 'both in masters and pupils, is present. I suggest, therefore, that (h) cannot he started upon until the educational standard has heen raised, hy which time the || Kuwait Oil Company will perhaps he ready to cooperate. 5. The instruction that Scott was considering comes under category (c), and it is in that category that preli minary steps might he taken now. I conveyed your message lib 1 * (paragraph 3 of your demi-official letter under reply) to Scott, and he was glad that you saw eye to eye with him in this matter. It is possible that his principals in London may hedge a little, hut it is early days yet. Vallance suggested that Kuwaiti hoys should he sent to the Technical School at Bahrain, and trained there. The Bahrain School is actually an apprentice training shop. Yallance was very keen on this, and Scott seemed quite to like the idea too as a temporary measure. The hoys who would enter such a shop must perforce he poor, and to send them to Bahrain would prove a heavy liability in the way of travel, living, pocket money expenses etc., and I do not think that the Kuwait State would he willing to shoulder this liability, though it is possible that the Kuwait Oil Company might. 7. So that something practical will emerge quickly,-3- I suggest that I 'be allowed to write to Scott proposing that the Kuwait Oil Company contribute two scholarships for Kuwait Arah artisan 'boys at the Bahrain Technical School this autumn. The 'boys should 'be selected 'by the Oompany in consultation with me. If you agree, while I am putting out a feeler to Scott, perhaps the views of the Bahrain Government could 'be obtained. I do not know how the Shaikh would react to such a proposal, 'but I think not too unfavourably. If made, it should he an incentive to him to speed up educational improvements.telegram From Political Resident, Bushire, at iihlraz* To His Maje8ty t s Jtebaaaador, iiagdad.

From enquiries, which we have made in London, it does not appear certain that Major Galloway will be in Koweit and Mr. Dundas feels that it would be useless for him to pay his visit unless Major Galloway were there. I am therefore sending a copy of this letter to Kov/eit, addressed to the Resident, in the hope that Major Galloway will arrive in time to see it. As you are more likely to be cognisant of the position than we are in London would you be so very kina as to send a message to Mr. Dundas, c/o The British Embassy in Bagdad, letting him know whether Major Galloway will be in Kov/eit.

I had a hrief talk with the Shaikh on the subject of education, 'but the time did not seem suitable for saying much. I shall return to the charge later. 3. With regard to paragraph 3, Sir Trenchard seems to have got the idea that I suggested the dropping of the idea of a technical class in Kuwait in favour of sending two hoys to Bahrain. I did not suggest this at all. What I suggested was, briefly, (c.f. paragraph 5 of my D.O.No. 0/274 of the 10th July, 1939), that preliminary steps might he taken now in regard to the preparation of skilled labour, and, so that something tangible and progressive might be done this autumn, (to obtain sanction and put up buildings, collect tools, plants, instructor etc. requires time), I suggested that we might sound the Kuwait Oil Oonrpany as to whether they would finance two scholarships to Bahrain. Please forgive me this repetition, but it seems necessary in the circumstances. 4. Scott put his original idea to his Board of Direc tors. It was for the formation of successive classes to train skilled labour and the lower grades of artizans. m'tjle Major O.G. Prior, CIE.. ^ '' BUSHIHS. at Bahrain-2- jpo The course of training suggested was to 'be of three months duration, after that the men were to 'be put on to produc tive work under close supervision so that in time they would 'become reasonably skilled at their trade. Glasses were to 'be run for two or three years after which time, if they proved successful and the need for them rore still felt, they could 'be developed into a permanent training centre. Scott's Board of Directors are not in agreement with the scheme, and have asked Scott for revised proposals. He is thinking the matter out. 5. Mo?/ that we are at war the case takes on a new aspect, much dependent on whether the Kuwait Oil Company are to drive ahead and produce, or to close down to a maintenance 'basis or to carry on steadily as at present. Those matters are far from my province, hut pending a decision t still think that if we can get two scholarships out of the Kuwait Oil Company no harm will 'be done. We should at least have made a start. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to the India Office direct as requested.COmUEMTIAL . ^ Political Agency, ^ ' nn Wrt «/«« BUSHIRE RESIDENC Y. Kuwait, D.O.

M q It seems to me that there is a field for propaganda in the G-ulf which has hitherto 'been neglected. This is the unconscious power of the Aral) sailor to represent us in a favourable light over a very wide area, from Basra in the north to Madagascar in the south, and from Cape Gomorin in the east to the Eed Sea in the west. 2. There are more than a hundred ocean going Kuwaiti dhows, all of which leave Kuwait in the autumn and return in the early summer. The sailor population amounts to 'between five to six thousand men, together with ahout three hundred carpenters and five hundred men of the n akhuda class. Though not every sailor goes to sea each year, yet a high percentage do so, and dhow sailings are, if anything, on the increase. In addition to the sailors, these dhows carry a large number of passengers, in some cases as many as one hundred and fifty, so that a large 'body of men and a very wide measure of contacts with the outside world are involved. 3. During their voyages, these men have ample time to talk with their passengers and the people they meet during their prolonged halts in the various ports they visit. They may talk of their homes and their 'business, hut they will also certainly discuss politics, a topic on which the coffee/ Hon^ble Lieut-Colonel G.G-. Prior, CIE., Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, at Kuwait.2 coffee-shop radios will provide them with plenty of material for gossip, if these men start out on their travels with a strong predilection for the British they will naturally espouse our cause, and will exert a strong Influence upon those with whom they come into contact, it is not suggested that they should spread propaganda, hut that they should unconsciously and naturally see things from our point of view. This could, I helieve, he brought atout hy benefits hemg conferred on the sailors and their families in Kuwait. These men are mostly married, and they are steady men. But they are poor men, and while they are away their wives and children are left almost uncared for. indeed some sailors are so poor that their youngsters have to sail with them as they cannot afford to keep them at home. 5. Of the possible ways in which His Majesty's Government could develop this source of propaganda through attention to the sailor class of Kuwait, the two most ohvious aire medical and educational. As regards medical, some grant could he given or personnel loaned to the Kuwait Government to assist in developing medical facilities, hut I would not recommend medical assistance except in conjunction with educational J improvements. Ihat I suggest is the provision of a school- doctor for Kuwait and also the establishment of a sufficient number of preparatory schools, (c.f. paragraphs 9 and 12 of Vallance # s report forwarded to you under cover of my letter No. 0/273 bf the 10th July, 1939). It seems to me that the merits of this proposal are that to carry it out would not he expensive, and the 'benefits would 'be lasting. Again, 'by assis ting in preliminary education only we should not 'be attempting to educate the 'boys 'beyond a station to which they could not hope to attain in later years. Should there 'be any doubt in your/1 (lk&gt; •3- your mind of the ability of the Arah sailor to broadcast hy word of mouth, I would remind you of the story that the sha-iifh related to you recently during your call upon him of the brutal action of a German officer towards a Muazzln in Dar-as-Salaam.

At the end of six months, if satisfactory, he will be given permanent employment with the Company. Other students will go to the Bahrain Petroleum Company'3 workshoDS for similar training after the expiration of their term of eighteen months in the Government workshops. Several carpentry students, who have completed their two years course, have been given employment in various Government departments and are doing well. The school is under my direct supervision, and I personally examine the boys during, and at the termination of their instruction period.IV0 -2- School Staff The staff consists of : One working instructor mechanic Two working instructor carpenters ihese instructors were obtained from Syria. English is also taught by a local Arab teacher for one hour each day. School Equipment The school equipment consists of One shearing machine One sawing machine One drilling machine One wood lathe Two grind stones Two emery wheels A complete blacksmith 1 s outfit Bench tools etc for six students. One electric welding plant One pipe screwing machine One G 11 (Power) Lathe and the usual other small equipment of a mechanical workshop. The school premises are at present being enlarged, after which four more engineering students can be taken. This scheme of technical education is still in its very early stages and, as time goes on, it is hoped that a larger and more comprehensive syllabus of training will be adopted. Students who show good progress could, possibly, be sent to such institutions as the City and Guilds College in London, where they could qualify for more highly paid executive posts, in this state or abroad. This may sound somewhat ambitious, but I see no reason why (although the process would be necessarily slow) such an aim should not be obtained. One important point, however, is that the standard preliminary e ducation in the ordinary State schools should be improvfiri /_ , r-3- improved, particularly in the later stages of the boy school life. They should leave school with a good working knowledge of Snglish, and practical mathematics, and perhaps, even be given some elementary science etc. This would prepare them for their training as constructive members of the community. I should like to emphasize the necessity of learning English, as most of the students who qualify will find emp loyment in the local Oil Company, or in one or another of the other companies in the Persian Gulf, where English would be a necessity, Sd/- W, B.

The training of local boys in engineering and carpentry continued during 1357, and during the year, four boys completed their carpentry course and were given work in Government Depart ments. The Muharraq section (one instructor and six students) h has been amalgamated with the Manama section, and an extension i; ! | will be built in the school to accommodate them. A temporary matting annexe has been added to house the extra boys, until the new extension is built. The engineering section is now doing useful work in carrying out new and repair work for other Government Depart ments. During their two years course, the boys serve three months in the Government motor repair Bhop, and same period in the Government Power House, whereby they gain useful general-1 engineering knowledge. The last six months of their course will be spent (if the boys develop satisfactorily) in jzihe Engineering Workshops of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. The following subjects are taught at present Mechanics and practical bench work Welding Blacksmithing Elementary Science and Applied Mechanics English Simple Arithmetic A technical library has been started, and text books and books of reference are supplied to the students in English and Arabic.' • I Confidential t Office of the Political Reeident In the Persian Gulf, Camp, Kuwait# D«0♦No#0/723 of 1959# Bated the i4th November, 1939 « fjol tic With referexi reup4 to correspondence ending with your dexol^officlal letter Mo#a/359, dated the and October 1939, I enclose a copy of a demi-official letter Ho#a/697-4/l5, dated the 3let Ootober 1939, froo ^eightman, and of its enclosure©, intimating that the Bahrain Government are prepared to admit two Arab pupils from Kuwait to their technical School at Bahrain# 2# It will be seen that the fee per headt exclusive of board and lodging, which v ^ill have to be arranged separately, is He.330/* per annum and that the course for mechanics lasts for two years# A similar sum will presumably be required for board arid lodging and aome ^s.l40/~ per annum for passages, making a total of iis#800/- per annum# 3# Will you please now take up the matter with Scott and ascertain whether the Company are prepared to grant two scholarships of the value of xie#80C/~ per annum, each tenable 3 for two years, and the conditions^ if any, they wish to ? attach to the grant • 4# If for any reason, the Kuwait Oil Company are unwilling to provide the scholarships, is there any reason why the Kuwait Government, in view of their increased income from oil, should not pay for them themselves^ iiaj or A»G # Galloway, IA#, Political Agent, Kuwait X' t-Confidential. n/er D.O.

I arrived in Kuweit on the morning of October T'th and was .aked by the Political Agent, Major Galloway, to stay in his house, was fortunate in that the Political Resident, Major Pryor, was in uweit at the time, so that I was able to discuss not only possibilities f British Council assistance for Kuweit, but for Bahrein as well. ; f 1 ine ot Educatio nal activitie s in Kuweit . • the data included in this section I am indebted to Mr. Scott of Kuweit Oil Company- I did not have an opportunity of checking i the statements made about the syllabus or standards reached in he various schools, but I have no reason to doubt their accuracy.) The comer stone of the educational pyramid is the Mabaraiciyah chool, which has about 350 boys ranging in age from eight to twenty, ■ere is a Palestinian headmaster and last year there were eight psistant Palestinian masters, but I believe five of these are not eturning. These Palestinian masters have been trained in Palestinian phools, and, in most cases, have degrees from the American University I Beirut. The school id divided into eleven primary classes of about lirty each and one 'secondary' class of about twenty-five boys ranging j age from thirteen to twenty. The English in the secondary section s very poor. The syllabus of both primary and secondary sections -tcludes Koran and religious Arabic reading, writing and grammar, pgiish (including some writing), geography, simple arithmetic and eometry with some elementary science. The output of the school is bout twenty per year. There are three 'preparatory' schools, of which the best is the tiadiyah, which has 170 boys aged seven to sixteen; the other two, le Kibliya and Sharkiya, have about 2M) boys between them, and a landard of literacy is not inasted upon. The masters in these schools fee all Kuweitis with no kind of teaching training. With the exception of the schools I have mentioned there is bthing except a number of Koranic schools where instruction is given iy Mullahs in the Koran and religion.

KUWEIT fcnp rliRh Master ^ In consequence of de Gaury f s educational report of January, • !lJ 'm939, and subsequent correspondence, the British Council offered m |to pay part (^500 per annum) of the salary of a teacher of English ^ Ifor Kuweit, Both Major Pryor and Major Ghalloway consider that the Rinie is not yet ripe for an English master to he offered to the Sheilch of Kuweit and Major Pryor is of the opinion that the British pouncil 1 s offer would be much more valuable if the Englishman ^Appointed vieve to be centred in Bahrein whe3?e he would be the senior Knglish master of the Bahrein High School, and itiere he would j . jtorobably be consulted on educational matters. If this were done, iiOjiJfiajor Pryor suggests that the Sheikii of Bahrein might be asked to ... iellow this Englishman to visit Kuweit occasionally in order to '■Mvise upon the teaching of English in the Mabarakiyah School* ' ct major Pryor considers that if this offer were made to the Sheikh 'of Kuweit he would be guite ready to accept and probably would be '''feather flattered at being able to get something for nothing from [Bahrein, In another year or two Kuweit might be ready for an - pnglish teacher of its own. I would therefore recommend that the grant already allocated lbj the Council to Kuweit be cancelled and a similar grant made in [the same terms to Bahrein, Major Pryor suggests that the money tehould be paid quarterly to Mr, Belgrave, the financial advisor to Mfthe Sheikh of Bahrein. Major Pryor has already written to Mr, Vallance asking him whether he would accept the suggested appointment. The contract will be arranged as soon as Major Pryor learns whether the Council ' agree to cancel the £500 allocation for Kuweit and to allocate, in lilts place, c €500 for Bahrein. .. ..'..f' '' '' til ^ ife J m i nl HHe j ff. C.A.F. Pandas's Report o n his Tour from Reot. K UWEIT Hand -crafts and Techftlcal Bducatlon . Mr. 3cott (Kuweit Oil OonTOanjr) some months apo mt up a scheme to his Company for running a technical class'in order to train Kuweiti youths as artisans and skilled labourers for the Oil Goirrpanv ' His scheme, however, was turned down on the grounds of expense and ' he gave me to understand that it was unlikely that much financial : assistance would he forthcoming until the Oil Company had started production, as it was almost impossible at this stage to estimate the probable output of oil or the length of time it would last, has put up an alternative suggestion for employing a of some twelve Kuweiti boys aged about fourteen under an Indian or other local stone-mason and putting them almost at once on to production work. At the end of three or four years those that remain would be of considerable value to the Oil Company. If this exnerlment were Bufficient he would start other gangs for training in other tyoes of skilled labour. Both Major Pryor and Major Galloway considered that a trained handwork instructor for the Mabarakiyah School would probably be acceptable to the Sheiich and would be of immense value in f xvIn'/ the older boys some kind of further training than they are at present getting from the School. Many or them are staying until the age of twenty learning nothing new, siraply because they are unfitted for any job in Kuweit. If a suitable man could be found to ibrganise sea scouts as a side line he would be still more valuable. A T)roT3erly run see scout troop would help to teach the Kuweiti boys that there was nothing legrading in getting their hands dirty. In addition it would tend to attract the children of Auweiti sailors. According to Major Oalloway these represent a very far reaching medium for -Dronaganda. There are something like 120 dhows in commission that travel for six or eight konths in the year all over the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and the EaSt coasts of -Africa, and sailors in these boats make Innumerable contacts Dn their voyages. He has already encountered several instances of Doth anti-German gossip and pro-English gossip widely spread by this Mans, and I consider that anything done by Great Britain for the Children of these sailors would have an amazingly wide publicity, I have no idea whether there is any possibility of finding a suitable man for such work. He should be experienced in teachinc: of ffood and metal work. If lie is an Englislman he should have some Knowledge of Arabic or at least be ready to pick it uo. as many of the Boys he would be teaching would have practically no English. If it IS not possible to find an Englishman there might be a'chance of jetting an Arab on loan from either the Palestine or Sudan Government, put it is toMkely that a sea scout could be found from either of taese sources. 1 l| f if I if iii : IMr. O .A .g.

While agreeing with you that it is essential for the Shaikh to spend some of the money he has recently received from the Kuwait Oil Company on the people of Kuwait, yet, before writing to Weightman, I should like to 'be sure that the position is correctly understood. From paragraph 2 of your letter I gather that you think that His Highness makes some contribution towards defray ing the expenses of educational and medical facilities. This is erroneous, for the fact is that he spends none of his oil receipts on the people, they are all paid into his 'banking accounts abroad. Both of the above are paid for from Customs receipts. It is, therefore, questionable whether the sending of four boys to Bahrain is an adequate share of the money for the people of Kuwait, or not. Were His Highness to do even this little, I am sure that the people would welcome it though I do not suppose that he would much appreciate spending money in Bahrain: however, that is no great consideration. 3. I very much doubt if His Highness has a scheme in view whereby the Kuwaitis will receive benefits from the recent addition to his funds, and, as you point out, unless he does do something, he is only storing up trouble/ •ble Lieut-Colonel C.G. Prior, CIE., itical Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.-2- troulDle for himself and his family. It seems to me that he should spend alxmt one-third of his oil income on Kuwait, or make it available for use in Kuwait, and he might perhaps he induced to do so. It is possible that a good start could 'be made as you suggest, 'but an alternative, of which I am in favour, is to put the 'broad picture to him now, and see if he will not consider utilizing some of the money 'by starting, say, his own Technical School here, or providing a better hospital, or putting the money into a proper Bank in Kuwait so that merchants can have the use of it.

I have no?/ spoken to His Highness and, I am glad to say, found him quite willing to discuss the matter 2 - To my suggestion that royalties should he divided into three parts. His Highness replied that the money remaining after he had made payments to the Subah family was put to State revenues. I said that I was glad to hear that, hut pointed out that perhaps the public might not he aware of it. To this he rejoined that revenue matters were discussed in the Majlis . I said that despite this it would he 'better if a 'budget were prepared to stave off possible criticism, and that I should like a copy. His Highness promised to do this on the return of Abdulla Sallm, that is to say in ahout three weeks' time. This is not, of course, a promise to dispose of his royalties in | the way suggested, hut I consider it to he a step in the right direction. He at least accepts the warning. 3. I then asked His Highness If he could not consi der instituting some work which would demonstrate openly his interest in the public welfare. He was averse to helping the Mission Hospital, and definitely said he would not do so. As for starting a technical school, he said he would consider that, and regarding better medical facilltle! he pointed out that he had already taken steps. I did not ,1 Lieut-Colonel O.G.Prior, CIS., • oiitical Besident in the Persian Gulf, Bushlre. press/ S/Co1. -2- press the point for we shall 'be in a more advantageous position to advise concerning a specific work when we have seen the promised budget. ID 4. The question of placing money to a Eeserve imnd led to a general discussion on money matters and I pointed out the difficulties in looking after money these days. His Highness agreed and said that he was a rich man out that his riches were sometimes a trouble to him. I therefore suggested that he should seek advice, and His Highness replied that he felt he would qmte soon have to get a British subject to advise him financially. His Highness made no definite request, but from what I know of him h^ would not make such a statement lightly, / and would expect me to take it up in the right quarters. It would suit lis if His Highness would accept a financial adviser nominally, as this person would, in fact, perform the functions of an adviser. An appointment of this sort is what we have 'beerl wanting for some time- c.f. your letter Ho.G/egs'of the'9th November, 1939, to Hay - and would meet with approval from the great majority of the merchant class. 5. It may seem premature to discuss personages to fill a post not yet created, hut as the case was dropped for want of a suitable person and as a name/has suggested itself to me I will mention it now. This person is Hogg who was until recently financial adviser to the Iraqi Government. His services were dispensed with in connection with the Ward - Iraqi railway dispute, and he had no jo'b when I last heard of him, i.e. x'mas last year. I have never met him, but I know his family which is approaching something like Legion, and this might possibly induce him to accept an appointment here, despite the fact that it would he inferior in status to his last post. Hogg is, of course, fully conversant with Arabic. v* 6. Beyond His Highness' mentioning the matter, I think now is/'7, U is a good time to take up the question again of an adviser, for, from His Highness downwards, Kuwait is pretty 'bewildered 'by current events.

'uwait students to Iraq,, vv \ S&gt;\Ih Translation of a leading article published in the vernacular paper 'INHAS' No»913 dated August 15th, 1940, Basrah, under the heading: THE PRINCIPALITIES OF THE ARABIM GULF AND ARE TEST INDEPfflBSNT OR COLONIZED? Arab problems have become complicated inspite of the awakening of the nation^ No sooner has one Arab problem been solved in Syria or Palestine than another requiring treatment arises and it is not pleasant to see such a state of affairs which disappoints every Arab and Moslem# We say this in order to draw our reader^ attention to the abbreviated news which we published in the local news column regarding a problem which concerned the sending of Kuwaiti students to Iraq. We and every Arab residing in the Gulf, or in any other country know that the Arab Princi palities in the Gulf have internal independence and that the treaties which were made between the English and the Chiefs of the Gulf Principalities do not refer to any interference in internal administration by the former&lt;, What the treaties do clearly express does not go beyond the enjoyment of some substantial and military benefits, and some other affairs relating to foreign policy. But with regard to the internal administration it has been left to the sons of the countries concerned particularly in the treaty between the British and Kuwaiti If this is a fact, then how did the Political Agent, Kuwait, interfere in a matter which does not concern him, but which concerns the local people themselves? The Kuwait Govern ment had decided to send some students to Iraq to be educated at the expense of the Iraq Government. Iraq had welcomed them in the same way as it did all the others, having done this through the impulse of its national duty but the Political Agent/s Agent requested the Emir of Kusrait to abstain from sending the students. Although this act is reckoned as a breach of the treaty existing between Kuwait and Great Britain, it is also reckoned as a disgrace to an Allied Power with Britain which represents the Arabs in all their countries. This act was received by every Arab with pain and sighs particularly by those lucky sons of Kuwait who count Iraq as a source of the Arab rising, and to be their extreme object of hope. No doubt this incident is attributed to the weakness shown more than once by the Shaikh of Kuwait. His submission and his action in abolishing the Legislative Council which included the best elements of the sons of Kuwait t made this authority to interfere, (although he has no right to do so), in an internal affair. This is not the first occasion on which Iraq has opened the doors of its educational institutions to admit students to be educated there, but this was its own idea since it brought itself into existence and since it took over the reins of self Government. Iraq considers itself responsible for all the problems of the Arabs for it was elected the Arab leader in view of its vigilance over the interests of the Arabs which are of first rate importance to it. If a part of a nation is attacked or the rights of that part are transgressed the whole of that nation suffers through its relations and Interests, i (jjM; - { 14 ^ J0]j| 1 null il ssil PP What danger could the Political Agent imagine there could be in sending Kuwait students to Iraq to be educated in Iraq schools. Moreover how did he dare to do so? He trespassed on a clear treaty and disgraced a nation in ajtime like the present when clean hearts, cordiality and fraternity are required. Do they expect the Arabs after this to trust in promises and to believe all that is said to them? The Arabs whether they were in Kuwait or in other countries did not love Iraq so deeply and so sympathetically antil they had tested its position in serving the interests of the Arab/~3- i.rab nation of which Iraq is naturally proud, and Iraq friends should boast of them also* Iraq nowadays is proceeding with firm and sure steps towards the stabilisation of its interests and those of the Arabs and its wise Grovernment (or Rashid Gorernment) is doing all in its power for the whole interests of the Arabs, so that the Arab nation may be able to take its position in this world and to occupy a rank of which it is worthy. Its right to be free and independent is more than that of other nations and it is hard for it to bear any disgrace or whatever may effect its leadership* We write this and our hearts are full of grief, for this is an act that is not in agreement with the interests of the Allied Powers in such critical circumstances when goodwill is required and there should be no negligence of the rights of friends and allies* We request our labouring Government which represents the desires of the Arabs, and request the states of the Arab Covenant which are responsible for the problems of the Arabs to be on their guard against this fearful act for we fear it may become worse and the countries of the Arabian Gulf will be subdued under foreign influence even in their internal policy* This of course will never be tolerated by the Arabs who are very covetous of their own interests* If we were and still are demanding our rights in Palestine and Syria how do we agree to any aggression taking place in any Arab country or area? Right does not agree to partition and the nation does not tolerate any aggression committed against her interests whatever it may be. We ought to be respected for this faith of ours if the causes of this war are as it has been said for the preservation of the freedom of the people*■ qo Confidential* Office of the Political Resident in the Pereian Gulf, ^ Qaispf SHIHAZ • I}#0#Ho«v/345# Dated the 14th September, 1940# od ' c My dear Galloway, j)' ' Will you please refer to the oorre&amp;pondenoe ending with Kuwait Printed Letter Ko»C/395, dated the 38th August 1,940 r i I return the cutting in original, eo that you may show it to the sh&amp;ikfe if he has not already iseen it, and would be glad to have it b&amp;ak when done with* Would you pleaee arrange for Yallanae'e visit and ask the shaikh to let us know at a very early date what he intends to do for Education in Kuwait t As X suggested in my letter Ho•467-^, dated the 2nd July 1940, his best arrangement will probably be to send some more boys to the Bahrain Technical School and he will probably also be well advised to send the boys originally destined for Iraq {if they cannot be persuaded to take technical training) to the higher classes that are being formed in Bahrain# By this means he will avoid importing a number of tiresome and truculent schoolmasters, nor, since it is so late in the scholastic year, is it likely that he will be able to find suitable ones, more especially now that Syria is in a disturbed condition* The accent should be on technical education, for Kuwait cannot possibly support more than a small number of •white collar 1 workers* 3# When he has done this, you should arrange for a suitable article to appear in the 41 Al Bahrain* (Metcalfe can fix this) alluding to the campaign in the Iraqi press, and pointing out that the Gulf States have excellent educational facilities of their own, and that in view of the venomous attacks on them from Iraq it is not surprising / that A.0.Galloway, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait.nl that they should prefer to make use of them# 3# These raeaeures in thenjgelv®© will not be enough to divert the Justifiable oritioiem which ie being made of the Shaikh 1 © administration# He iu receiving very large auiae of money and spend® next to nothing on beneficial objects# He could easily inoreaee the scope of hie medical work, and there are probably other measuree yfhich would be well receivod locally# Until he prepares a budget and lets people know where, at any rate, ioiae of the money goe&amp;, he ie bound to incur justifiable criticism* Yours sincerely, /V17V Confidential Office of the political Resident in the Pereian Gulf, Oarap, uhiraz.

This class has started to function and is perhaps to take the place of the 'higher' education the Shaikh mentioned to Daubeny vide paragraph 2 of his D.O.ITo.428 of the 14th Septem- ber. 5. The Shaikh seems to me to be in a complete muddle over this education business and to say what first comes into his head. I am not taking any action until I have thrashed the matter out with Yallance. 6 . I am reminding the Shaikh of his promise to let me have a 'budget and hope to -be aMe to send it to you soon.

I enclose two copies of a report submitted by Yallance during his visit here in September and October this year. 3. 1 did not know that an education committee was in existence. ^ This resembles Boards of Governors in our educational system, and may serve some usefuX purpose here. However we need not concern our selves with it I suggest. The number of schools is the same as last year. 4. We were already aware of the sum available and cannot, when considering education as a whole in Kuwait, think in terms of good and bad years. 5 and 6. Ko comment. 7 and 7j tooling was not free in Kuwait until two years ago, when between one and two rupees a month were paid, a ridiculously low figure. Yallance suggests (not in the report) that fees per term per boy attending the top three classes of the Bibarakiyah should be ils.6, half that figure for the next three classes, and the remainder one rupee. There is a good deal to be said for the suggestion in that it would prevent a number of parents sending their children to school to keep them out of harms way, and would prevent educating hoys just for the sake of education. On the other hand to revert to payment now would be bad for prestige, as it would be looked upon as a retrogressive step, and, at the present time, I am against any suggestion to raise money from the people for State Institutions. I think that this point had best be left alone for the time being. 8. Fo comment. 9 and 10. The number of boys and girls attending school is a very small percentage per head of the population but I think that we had better concentrate on suggestions for the improvement of what is already in existence rather than suggest expansions. 11 and 12. Ho comment. 13 and 14. I might bring the main points to the Shaikh's notice. 15,16 and 17. Ho comment. 2 My comments are as follows: ion^ble leut.-Gol. C.G.

I assume it is too early for us to suggest a complete separation from the Iraqi method of education, and as I think some modification of the present ambitious system is necessary, my proposals, which I have discussed with Tallance, are made on the a'bove assumption. The syllabus can stand for the top three classes of the MUbarakiyah, and the remainder should omit geometry, 'biology, civics; chemistry and physics to 'be omitted from all classes unless proper equipment is forthcoming. The commercial class is an excellent idea. But so far it is not much more than that, and I think I should point out to the Shaikh that his statement to me that instead of sending 'boys to iraa he has opened a commercial class here can only 'be accepted as empty until an instructor and equipment such as typewriters 'books etc. are provided. Classes 1,2 and 3 should only study the three Es, plus singing, Physical 'Training and manual labour. 20.The principle is correct, and with the small control we have we need not concern ourselves with detailed operation. If we make Tallance's suggestion to the Shaikh it may be regarded as a damper. 21.1 will write to Palestine for the list. 22 and 24. ¥e cannot suggest improvements in the staff unless an increased income is assured. I have collected the various expenditures mentioned by Yallance in the report and they total about Es. 4200 a month. This excludes the cost of books and incidentals, and eats up all the income approximately. To restaff the schools with a dozen or so efficient teachers from Palestine would cost about 30,000 rupees a year, and before any mention can be made of a suggestion of improvement in the staff to the Shaikh, it must be decided what proposals we have to make for increased funds. 23.My offer of help in this matter was declined. 25.Improvement again is a question of funds. I venture to disagree, so far as Kuwait is concerned, with Tallance regarding the employment of the weakest masters in the lower classes, for as so small a proportion of the boys reach the top classes to allot the best instructors to the lowest classes would be uneconomical and futile. 26.Fo comment. 28 and 29. This is unsatisfactory but we need not concern ourselves now I suggest. 30.Fo comment. 31. If it is decided to put a proposition for increased funds to the Shaikh then I think that mention might be made of the need of two new buildings. 32,33 and 34. These points might be brought to the Shaikh^ notice. Vallance says that he thinks that some 400 desks are needed. As regards the national anthem I will address you separately.I SI .-3-. 35. This might 'be further impressed on the Shaikh* Personally I do not agree that we can expect the Kuwait Government to insist on free house to house treatment for siok hoys. 36,37,38,39 and 40. I think that we need not concern ourselves with female education at this stage, 'but I suggest that the folly of refusing to send the hoys to Iraa, and at the same time employing Iraqi teachers for the girls might 'be pointed out to the Shaikh. 43,46 and 48. That something is 'being done is satisfactory. 47. This can only 'be put right 'by the opening of dispensaries which need not 'be considered in this letter. 49. This aspect is receiving our attention. 50 and 51. The inadequacy of the educational grant, 'based on improvements recommended 'by Yallance, excluding female education, amounts in round figures to Hs. 30,000 for instructors (recurring expenditure) and Bs. 15,000 for 'buildings, and Bs. 5000 for equipment (non recurring expenditure). The following ways of raising these funis occur to me. a) Taxation. This is out of the question I think. 'b) School fees. I think inadvisable see notes on paragraphs 7 and 7A. (c) Profits from such sources as the Landing Company and the Electricity Company. These are semi-state concerns 'but without knowing more of their composition I would not recommend making any suggestions in this connection. (d) Allotting a proportion of the Oil and Sulphur annual receipts. This is the ohvious source to 'be tapped now, 'but to what extent it is not so easy to determine. The Shaikh is now drawing some Bs. 500,000 from these sources. A suggestion from us might take the form of the Shaikh f s making a contribution to Educational ITunds on a percentage 'basis in the same way as present funds are obtained. I have no guide as to what to suggest, 'but think that b% would he reasonable and if acted upon would provide sufficient money on which to make a start. Without very considerable pressure the Shaikh would not part with this amount but he might be induced to part with 1-^ % fairly easily. (e) Provision of the British Council of a teacher for English. While it is no part of His Majesty^ Governments obligations to provide a teacher for Kuwait the spreading of cultural propaganda is one of their interests. In fact, only last year it was decided to send Yallance to Kuwait on behalf of the British Council, though later it was agreed that Kuwait was not ready for such a step. How, however, I think the matter might be reconsidered if we are to co-operate with the State in the improvement of education. It will be seen from Yallance S report that the study of English is considered of great importance and now I hear that the Shaikh is sending his two youngest sons to study English in the evenings under an Arab Christian. It is, therefore, possible that from the next school year the State might be willing to accept an English Master, not a Director of Education (Yallance had something of this in view of his paragraph 51), and if things go on much as at present I think Kuwait would stand an Englishman by that time. If this step /were: 2 --4-. were agreed upon, and the Shaikh could 'be induced to part with some of his royalties, education in Kuwait would have taken a great step forward. This man might in addition run an evening Institute as teaching English would only occupy his mornings. I have not fully considered such a proposition, hut I think there can he no harm in submitting it tentatively now. There is also a possiMlity that his services might heiutilised in connection with Technical Education, and I will submit a separate letter on that point. If we are to resist Iraqi penetration something must he provided In return, and I do not 'believe that Bahrain will ever supply that something in the eyes of Kuwaitis. If there are no facilities at home, then they will look westwards, however sound Bahrain institutions may 'be. In any case there is nothing free ahout the facilities growing up in Bahrain. 3. While the question of provision of funds and possible help from the British Council is under consideration, I suggest that I address a letter to the Shaikh on the lines of my comments ahove./ w ttu Agenoy* KUWAIf, 1 Cototwr 1940.

A natural hlstosy- toak will dsscribe the Halted fauna of the desert i smd so on. It is quite a oownon thing for •Iraqi sohoolboys to compile and publish text -books, soas of which actually find their way into the schools. (teod tsxt-books in the Arable language, and Arablo text-books sfaioh teal «ith aatters outsids ths Arab world, are notoriously few, and tot auch can be dene about this at prssent.

Of the thirty-sewen meters, fifteen toeluding all the Palestinians) can be considered useful employees, Bd six others are good Julias for ^ur'an and Religion* The remaining JUteen are of very little value, and really should not be in the Hhools at all. In the view of the Director of Studies* eight good new &gt; MShers frosi Palestine are needed at once j but I should describe this U a very consermtife estimate. p. Palestinian teaohers are recruited privately* by advertisomeet in be Palestine newspapers, and not through the Palestine Mucation De- irtaent. The six now working at Kuwait are useful second or third- hte teachers. Only one of them, the headmaster of the Mubaraklyah, hi- been trained as a teacher (and that only in Baghdad;, and not one it tho has had a regular sohool career as a boy, or has attended a diversity. They are, however, superior to the local men. 24- Apart from the few teachers obtained from Palestine, new aasters ire enlisted by the method of promoting @th or 9th Class Atbarakiyah jMuclboys - a vicious circle which can remit in little success until Mtttu education has been established at the iubarakiyah Sohool itself, four new masters were created in this way at the beginning cf the pres et school year s they are little acre than boys, and have had no Itaining as teachers whatsoever.1 - 10 .

The Direotor of Studies is aware of the extreme mvi edom of this polioy, but is forced to adopt it if he is not to ^ deprive the top olasses of the few able masters wUich Gxe schools poss- ^ eee. It need hardly be added that the amount of education iaparted to the younger pupils of the Kuwait schools is extremely saallt or that the boys thus acquire no sound foundation upon shich more advano* Id work might be built later on. All the work of the boys in the higher classes at Kuwait shews this clearly. ^6. xhe salaries paid to easters at the four schools sore as follows i | fo deal first with the Palestinians* the headaaster of the ilubara- liyah, sho acts also as Director of Studies for all the schools, in.

There are no allowances* of any kind, and the saasters find their own accomodation. Their trav- tllling expenses between Palestine and Kuwait are paid at the beginn ing and end of their service. B7. The above salaries for Palestinians, though reasonable, are out •f all proportion to those paid to Kitwaitis, the most fortunate of ' tooa receives Just over £3a month, and the woret&gt;paid less than These figures compare badly with those now in force for local-bora | aasters at town schools in Bahrain.

I understMJd that tore is only one other house in Kuwait suitable for conversion into a Ifcowl, but this is at present occupied by a doctor. She cost of build- lug two new schools would bo about 15,000 rupees each. M. The state of repair of the present school buildings is between fair «4 poor. A good deal of work could usefully be done on all of thea. 53. mo sohool equipment is meagre, and in poor condition. The school jItts are all badly designed, and they bear little relation to the sises F the boys *ho have to sit in thea.

Last year* the girls* schools of Kuwait contained one Kuwaiti leaoher, two 'Iraqis* and three Palestinians. The Palestinians were ftjreo sisters* who had arrived in Kuwait under the chaperonage of a Irother* mo was later taken on as a mater at one of the boys' schools. U1 four were efficient teachers. Very shortly before the end of the Mhool year, a story was spread in the town to the effect that the listers were taking some of their young pupils, for teaoral purpose a, to the brother 5 and a good deal of excitement ensued. Those Who be- Ueve the story were probably unaware that an exactly similar aooasa- tton had* only a fortnight earlier* been sprsad against five Syrian taaale teachers in Baghdad. Both in Baghdad and in Kuwait the accusa tions were followed by dismissals* and in Kuwait the brother imaediate- ly sent in his own resignation as well. Where this little plot* if Plot it was* originated* it is impossible to say } but what followed U possibly significant. The Director of Studies at once asked leave to set about the engagement of fresh Palestinian teachers in place of those dismissed t but sh. Yusif bin 'Issa vetoed this* saying that he vishad personally to obtain the new teachers $ and in due course he produced no less than five new woman teachers* shorn he had recruited la 'Iraq, One of these had previously taught at a governtaent schoole 14 II* at AiaaiBh or Diwaniyahi and the otbar four wore sohoolgirXe who had reached only Olaee 3 at the goTerniaent eeooadary school at Baerah^ fbe net result of the exchange, therefore, is not only that the girle' eohools of Kuwait hare heen saddled with a nu-aber of alisoet useless teachers, hut also that 'Iraq, has obtained in them a greatly inoreased yepreseatation* Of the ten featale teachers now eaployed, seven are 'Iraqis, two are Palestinians, and only one is a Kuwaiti. It aaay be s&amp;ded. In oonolusion, that the Education ttee now olaiats that the reason for the dieaissal of the three Palestinian woaen was that they refused to remain in Kuwait, as they had been asiced to do, during the three sronths of their auamer holidays i but I do not believe there is s word of truth in this. 40. hjs standard of education at tbe girls* schools falls far below that of toe boys' schools, and the cause is the inadequacy of the teaching. A glance at the qualifications of the atembers of me female •taff of the %'aaita, the -sost important of the girls' schools, *111 sake this clear. At the head of it is the new 'Iraqi teacher&gt;found V/ Sh. YUsif, t &amp; io had previously taught at Aaarah or Diwaniyah i then some the four half-educated schoolgirls from Class 3 at Basrah | and at the end a Palestinian woman who is not a teacher by profession at all. There is a bad habit in Kuwait of engaging woaen as teachers, and even of maJclng them headsaistreeses, simply because they happen, as wives or sisters of sale foreign teachers, to be resident in the town. The Palestinian woraan in question oa»e to Kuwait to look after her brother, and was promptly taken on as a teacher at the Wasita t and this is typical of the haphasard way in which female education la Kuwait is oonddotsd. 4 1. the salaries paid to the woasn teachers are as follows ip .is- 42.Tha headmistress of the %Mlt» School is paid £10 per aoath, tbe two other headalstresees* with five assiataat aletresaest each re- lelte M. The Palestinian alstreee eho is not really a teacher seta £4, and the single Kuwaiti Jala trees has to he content with 40 rupees. The travelling expenses of waen teachers from outside Kuwait are paid in the Mm waff as those of the men. i 43. Finallyi there are the six *Mulla schools' situated at oonoider- ible distances froa the town. One of these Is estahlished in the Tillage of Jahrah, due west of Kuwait* about half-an-hour toy car, on tbe road to Basrah. It contains about 30 ooys, taught toy a single Ibllat eiio is paid 35 rupees per month« Another stands on the island itJteilaka, ehiOh is atoout an hour oy aotor-tooat from Kuwait. Ear# tiers are about 70 tooyst under two Mullas* who receiTO 30 rupees and 25 rupees respeetirely. Tne other four are all situated on the sea- wast, south of the Bay of Kuwait, and are between half-aa-hour and one hour toy oar from the town. They are j Oiamah (35 boys, 1 .iulla, 20 rupees) | fontas (33 boys, 1 Malla, 20 rupees) { Abu Hilaifa (17 toys, 1 i £ulla, 15 rupees) t and faihil (11 boys, 1 Jtulla, 13 rupees). L44. I hare yieited five of these six Tillage sohools, but i^ailaka. .mm to transport difficulties, 1 have not yet been able to see. Ihey •re fairly typical of the 'Julia sohoole' to toe found in this part of | . tbe world. Where the bullae confine themselTes to the teaching of the tytr*an and Religion, with a little reading, writing, addition,and nbtraction, and at these subjects usually do their limited beet. The ireeence in the Tillages of 'ilulla schools• is certainly better than ^ no sohools at all, and with a little care, encouragement, and support they can toe turned Into really serTlceable Tillage eohools. Bit in Bntait, after a little preliminary fostering, they are utterly neglec ted, by all concerned. The policy of the Bduoation Goaralttee seems to be as follows « Hawing discoTered a Mull* and his little ragged circleb so it oornar of a village aosque, it prooeedo to build in the desert little mud.room, measuring thirty feet ^ fifteen, end to put round it # ur wry high walls, eaoh sixty feet in length, one of them containing ttny wioket-gate for entrance. When this is done, it informs the ast- l*ed ulla that in future it will pay him eaoh month the few rupees l«h in the past he has been forced to extract from the parents of his ■lis* It then invites the whole party to quit the precincts of the wue and to enter the new 'school' j and taere the aovernment stops M. All that it does, in reality, is to give to these little ooasauni- •s 'a local habitation and a name' i the schooling wiiioh the children I |&lt;1 tc remains exactly the same as it was before the MOTe, except that b^Mdllas are now less dependent, for their livelihood, upon their s&amp;tll '»teachers « they are in safe Jobs, where their pay no longer bears any ttation to the numbers of their pupils. ' MfoT9 1 visited the village schools of Kuwait, tbe Director of Itiies bad assured aa that be inspected eaoh of them regularly once wy year, and that they were all supplied free with books and station- j3 but wben 1 took him with me on ay visit he was unable to locate ' sites of the more distant schools, and was unable to find, in any toe schools, any trace of books or stationery, fhe Direotor said lit they had certainly been supplied last year, and that if they had \ reached the villages this time, it was because the school year was, • fer, only three weeks old. I The {ullas at Jahrah, Dimnah, fantae, and Abu Hilaifa seemed to be Htfit and painstaking men, whose boys did credit to the limited teach- II thich they had received } Hut at Faihil, the most distant school, ftund an enormously fat aulla asleep in bed, inside the school, which to contained his kitchen-fire, his cooking utensils, and his food. P place was filthy, and the few copies of the %ur , an which the school '•essed had been thrown carelessly into a comer (a thing which I have * W- 3.7 - L j seen tooioroi in any -juslix school). Qunn was no sign of any ipile, or of their rooont preeanoe in the oohooX. mo blocKboardt as a pieoe of bedroom furniture, had heen put outaide in the Ltoeol-yard. Adjoiaiag the sobool preatisee was the Holla's own house&gt; kloh oontained his eife and fsally t out he Massif preferred the jiaae and quietness of the aowroaent school. ^«fe is no asdiosl oare soever of Tillage sohoolhoys. There tno Tillage doctors, or oedioal facilities, me Syrian doctor re- rod to ahoTe has mrely informed the Director of Studies that side #ye j oa these Tsry poor Tillages (shich are twenty miles or acre away lis Kuwait) met w»Ws in to the town to see him i he did not enter into hquestion of ways or msaas* and mere the aatter has been left. At Hie school at fiimnah, the Whole of the 13 boys present (it was itastadhan) nre suffering from curable eye-disease. 4s Z reported last year# the Mical position in Kuwait as regards the care of children would be a preach to any self-respecting State. It is to bs hoped that before long toe education authorities of it will see the wisdom of supplying sach of these distant schools Ith at least one capable teacher to work side-by-side with the Atllae, are excellent men for religious instruction alone. The Tillage ols will also haTs to be brought under seme form of proper super- lien, if they are to achieTe any success worth mentioning j and proper *Ueal oare is a crying necessity. In conclusion, it must not 'sat supposed that all Kuwaiti boys who teeiTe education reoeire it la Kuwait. Parents are still sending their N to 'Iraq or to Beyrouth,and their declared reason so doing is M Kuwait eaucation is at prsssnt unable to proTide their offspring adequate equipment for the future, those itoo send their boys sway FWg mostly to ths Merchant and business section of the public, andIB - (htre are to m twenty-four ICuwadtl boys at present being educated abroad, moet of them In 'Iraq.

(2) Interference by the educationally Ignorant education Con;ilttee, both collectively and individually. (3) Absence of constant icnowledgeable advice.

SSo. c/501 • Kuwait, 28tii October, 1940 Will you please refer to paragraph 2 of your memo- randum No. c/883 of the 14th December, 1959? this year and in that little I must say that I was very dis appointed with the visitiais^ First of all I asked Vallance to write me a brief factual report on education here. This he set about doing after he had been here some five days (he arrived before I returned from recess although I had 'Cold him I could not put him up until later)* That is to say that he started work on the 23rd and submitted the report on the 9th of October (it is dated the 1st). During the oj urse of the preparation I asked him more than once to be brief and speedy, and notto worry too much over dotting Is and crossing Ts, but my expostu lations were of no avail. Had he based this report on last year's he would have saved a lot of time, but he did not even think of referring to it. 3. As to the report itself, it is, in my opinion, tedious. It occupies itself with pett^ scandals, and is particularly remarkable/ I have very little to say concerning Vallance's visit Hon'ble Lieut-Col. C.G.Prior, CIE., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.-2- remarkable for its lack of information on the actual work of the 'boys. The report is nicely typed. 4. I also wanted Vallance to hold some sort of class him self &gt; and I suggested anjevening class to instruct the masters who teach English, The matter was 'broached to the Headmaster who demurred, but although I decided to disregard that the length of time taken over the report (it works out at about two pages a day) prevented anything in this direction. During the few days after the submission of the report Vallance held an examination in the Mubarakiyah School to select four boys for Technical Education in Bahrain, and otherwise was helpful. 5. Vallance was more cordially received by the Educational Authorities than last year, and hias visit was beneficial as showing to the Kuwaitis that we take an interest in educational affairs. The inspection also helps to keep all concerned up to scratch. This right to inspect education in Kuwait which we are gradually building up is very valuable indeed, and next year I hope to be able to submit a more favourable report. /rConfidential* —~~ Office of the Political Heeident in the Persian Gulf, Oamp t Baliraln* D#0*Ho«C/465» Dated the i2th Bovember i940» My dear Oalloway, KUaae refer to your desni-official letter Sfo«C/496* 4 /15, dated the 29th October 1940, regarding Education in Kuwait• 2« 1 agree generally with your views, and see no objection to your addressing the Shaikh as proposed In your paragraph 3. 3, Since, however, I shall be in Kuwait myself in about a fortnights time, 1 would prefer that the matter should be left in abeyance till then if possible There is no question but that the Shaikh will have to stump up for the improvements in education, but the question of how much he is to pay will require careful consideration# I very asuoh doubt if we could get another Bngliahman out of the British Council, but it might be possible to get them to pay for a good Palestinian Direator of Education who would see that some of Vallance f s recaoioendations were carried out# Perhaps you would consider this and let me have your views when 1 arri ve ?

The new advanced school, which will open in a few days, after the entrance examination which takes place tomorrow, is not free. Boys will pay a fee of 'tis 6/- per month. There will '1 -I be 40 - 50 boys in this school. There are numerous local mullah schools and one or two private schools. The custom at mullah schools varies, in some cases parents pay a sum to the mullah when their children finish reading the Quran or they make a monthly payment, the amount depending on the financial position of the parent varying from a few annas to a rupee.
