British Residency BAHRAIN . iitWoG^kiiribcjPxKJt. Bmauce. Reference to previous correspondence : Description of Enclosure \ Name and Pate. j Subject. Letter from Residency Surgeon, Bahrain. Re: BOAC aeroplane accident. iFrom The Residency Surgeon, Bahrain, To The Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to forward the following report in connection with the British Overseas Airways Corporation air plane accident of the 23rd August, I received information of the accident from the British Overseas Airways Corporation at about 5-20 a.m. and proceeded to the jetty immediately. On arrival sixteen injured persons and one dead had just been landed. They were sent on to the Government Hospital in transport supplied by British Overseas Airways Corporation, ^-he Station Superintendent informed me that there were still nine passengers in the submerged plane; but there was no hope of any of them being alive. 3. Of the sixteen injured five were detained in the hospital, Mr. Fitzgerald, a passenger was in a state of nervous shock and had fractured ribs, the Pilot and Steward had bad scalp wounds and two Chinese passengers with severe sprains and contusions, all the remainder sustained only minor injuries and were sent back to the British Overseas Airways Corporation Rest House after being dressed. 4. The Station Superintendent asked us to make preparations to rescue nine dead bodies which he thought would be rescued from the submerged plane during the course of the day. Under instructions from the Political Agent, I together with the inspector and a sergeant of the police went to the jetty at 2 p.m. for identification and Medical examination of the Dead still to be recovered from the plane, by 6 p.m, only four bodies were recovered making a total of five bodies for the day. The remaining five bodies wererecovered at odd times during the next five days. All were accounted for the the 28th ultimo. r 5. The Government Hospital Mortuary can accommodate only three bodies, which is ample for its legitimate purpose. Five bodies however in an advanced state of putrification had to be kept on in the Mortuary all night and prepared for burial. This caused great inconvenience to the Hospital Staff and in patients, as can well be imagined. It was indeed fortunate that the remaining fatilities were not recovered the same day. I am of the opinion that a police morgue if opened and equipped to deal with fatalities .from accidents etc. is a real necessity. The matron of the Hospital with help from the nursing staff had to prepare putrifying corpses kept in the Hospital Mortuary for burial, which is not part of their duties for obvious reasons. After the experience of the nigh^of the 23rd with five corpses in the Mortuary, the remainder were examined at the jetty and sent direct to the cemetery. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sgd. W. Steele. Residency SurgeonD.O. No. C/1021. The 15th of October, 1947. Dear Sir Rupert, \ Please refer to Residency printed Letter Ko. 1991-81/16, dated the 19th September, 1947. 2. While X appreciate the force and truth of the Residency Surgeon’s remarks about the inadequacy of the Bahrain Governraent’s facilities for dealing with accidents indeed, there is no event which brings one into personal contact with the working of the Bahrain Government’s Departments that does not bring home to one their in adequacy -, I feel it is for us to advise the Bahrain Government that their facilities are inadequate, and to leave it to them to decide how best to remedy the defi ciencies. 3. The Bahrain Government received £1604.16.2 this year from the British overseas Airways Corporation for the rent of the aerodrome for 1947 and for aircraft ser vices, additional to the first, that used it during 1946 - vide correspondence forwarded with Residency endorsement No. 1035-S, dated the 30th May, 1947. In addition, Bahrain benefited from the trade brought to the Island by the British Overseas Airways Corporation, and from customs duties paid on the Corporation’s local purchases. 4. All the services pertaining specifically to their aircraft are provided by the British Overseas Airways Corporation; so I feel that the British Overseas Airways Corporation, which does not have sufficient hospital cases to justify its having its own hospital, has a right to expect, in return for its contribution to the Bahrain Government’s revenues and to general prosperity here, reasonable standards of general administration in Bahrain. In this general administration, I incluae adequate facili ties for attending to casualties from accidents. 5. On this occasion it was not only the mortuary that proved inadequate: the Bahrain Government’s Chief Medical Officer was on leave and no full time relief had been pro vided in his place; the air-conditioning apparatus in the European ward broke down; and, when it was working, it was, I understand, so noisy that it seriously disturbed the only patient on the D.I. list. Indeed, it appears to be generally agreed among the doctors who attended him that it *as only his removal to the Bahrain petroleum Company’s hospital in Awali, where he still is, that saved his life. /6. It so, The Ron’ble Lt-Col. air Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.b.I., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.6. I&amp; so happened that this accident happened to a British Overseas Airways corporation aircraft; but, with the industrial development that has taken place in Bahrain in recent years, the possibility of accidents of all kinds occurring cannot be ignored. A serious explosion in the refinery could easily tax the Company’s - medical resources beyond capacity, while a fire or an explosion in a ship, a petrol filling station, or the water distillation plant in Manama could more than fill the existing hospital accommodation here; and X feel that adequate provision for such emergencies is overdue. 7. I have commented separately in ray derai-officiul , - r letter NO. C/992, dated the 3rd October, 1947, on the insufficient number of European medical officers employed by the Bahrain 'aovernfient; and I suggest chat I be authorized to draw the Adviser’s attention to the defi ciencies in the arrangements for dealing with accidents and to suggest that they be rectified and that an additional medical Officer be engaged. Dr. pridie was of the opinion that the Bahrain Government required a Public Health Inspector and a Medical Officer of Health in addition to the present Chief Medical Officer. 8. I consider also that the Adviser should be warned now that it will not again be possible to lend the ser vices of the Agency durgeon to deputize for the Bahrain Government’s Chief Medical Officer, because the Agency Surgeon already has more than enough work of his own. yours sincerely,D*0 •Ko • 1809-S The Residency, Bahrain, the 20 th October 1947. VA Please refer to your demi-official letter No.C/1021 of the 15th October. 2. 1 have discussed the proposal made in para graph 7 with you and do not consider any action necessary at present. 3. Reference paragraph 8 please inform the Bahrain Government that experience has shown that it is not possible for the quarantine Medical Officer to deputise as that Government’s Chief Medical officer and perform his own functions properly at the same time and that we regret therefore that it is unlikely that we shall be able to consent to a similar arrangement being made on any future occasion. BAHRAIN Confidential RHL.2 . 3. Routine , Please see correspondence at p. 65 - 63 of C.O. file 13/2. From this it will be observed that the Bahrain Government have received a sura of £ 500 in respect of rent due for the year ending 31.12.47, and a further amount of £ 1104.16.2 for additional services operated during the year ending 31.12.46; thus making a total of £ 1604.16.2. In addition, they receive landing and housing fees (as amended from time to time), which are collected by the R.A.F. and B.O.A.C. their behalf, vide- p. 3 &amp; 4 of .Civil Air Agreement placed below. v^e are not in a position to say how many additional services will have been operated by the B.O.a.C. this year, nor are we in a position to quote figures of landing and housing fees for the same peridd. Needless to say though, these amounts must be very substantial ones. We do not have on record statements of landing fees collected in the past. I suggest, to strengthen our case, we a3k the Bahrain Government to give us the figures referred to in paragraph 2 above for the last three years. We can then strike at an average.

Following the crash, in which a number of passengers were killed, the Bahraini authorities struggled to cope with the number of dead bodies.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000fc#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
