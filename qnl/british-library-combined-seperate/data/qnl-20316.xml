It also discusses the practicalities of paying the pension promised by the Chief of Bahrein, Muḥammed bin Khalīfah Āl Khalīfah, to Shaikh Mahomed bin Abdullah.The item has three enclosures:1. Translation of a letter from Hajee Jasseim, Agent at Bahrein, to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 31 March 1855.The enclosure is reporting that Shaikh Ali bin Khaleefeh has called off his blockade, citing cost and the improved political situation, and returned to Bahrein. It notes that Ameer Fysul has advised Shaikh Mahomed bin Abdullah to accede to the wishes of the British Government, and that he is expected to call on the Resident to adjudicate between the Al Khuleefeh [Āl Khalīfah] and the Al Abdullah.2. Translation of a letter from Ameer Fysul, Wahabee Chief to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 2 March 1855.The enclosure states that the Chief does not know what has transpired to push the British to call for the removal of the sons of Shaikh Abdullah bin Ahmed [‘Abdullāh bin Aḥmad Āl Khalīfah] from Demaun, but he is sure they have their reasons; it does however caution against giving too much weight to the representations of their opponents. It further reiterates that they did not seek to perpetuate disorder at sea through taking asylum in Wahabee territory.It is noted that Shaikh Mahomed bin Abdullah is himself proceeding to Bushire in order to make his views known to the Resident.3. Translation of a letter from the Resident in the Persian Gulf to Ameer Fysul, Wahabee Chief, dated 3 April 1855.The enclosure expresses the Resident's gratification over the Chief's cooperation in the maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the Persian Gulf. It further explains that after the attack on Bahrein in July 1854 the British were no longer in a position to restrain Shaikh Mahomed bin Khuleefeh [Muḥammed bin Khalīfah Āl Khalīfah] from taking whatever measures he saw fit to secure his position; the position of his exiled kinsmen at Demaun could therefore only serve to perpetuate disorder.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051548.0x00003a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
