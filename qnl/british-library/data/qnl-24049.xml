Dear Agency, Not/' that Bosworth proposes to run scheduled services, arriving at Doha from Bahrain on ,/enesdays and Sundays, and leaving Doha for Bahrain on Thursdays and Sundays, we think that there is a great deal to he said for your despatching our mail hy him. It lifts another burden from the Company, makes a moi’e orderly office routine possible here, and should-in most cases result in a swifter service, as our mail commonly takes 4-5 days by its present route.

We are now receiving and despatching our bag by Mr.Bosworth's aircraft and find his service convenient and extremely regular. 3. As, however, there is the alternative of the weekly R.A.F service, where the bag would be handled by officers and N.C.O.S directly responsible for its safety under Air Force Law, we .would suggest that, strictly speaking, we should use this service instead of Bowworth’s ™ -purity.
