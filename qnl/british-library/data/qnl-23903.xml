I am considering making a proposal to the Government of India for the installation of a dictaphone ’n this Agency, but I must frankly tell you, that I am very doubtful if they will sanction the expenditure. to adjust a machine so that it can be used at /ill with (a) 230 volts A.C.(50 cycles) and (b) 110 volts D.C ? The reason for my question is that here in the Agency the town current of 230 volts A.C. is used and when on tour in one of His Majesty 1 s Ships 110 volts D.C. only would be available. •ould you kindly tell me if it is possible Yours faithfully f]A^ Lieutenant-Colonel Political Agent, Bahrain.CONTRACTORS TO'- THE TREASURY-THE ADMIRALTY • WAR OFFICE • GENERAL POST OFFICE- INLAND REVENUE-ET?

Each of the Dictaphones specified could be FURNISHED TO OPERATE ON 2^0 VOLTS AC $0 CYCLES, AND I 10 volts DC. Actually the motor which operates these INSTRUMENTS WILL OPERATE AS LOW AS ?5 VOLTS DC WITH A CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF *22 AMPERES. A RESISTANCE WITH AN ADJUSTABLE BRIDGE PERMITS OF USING IT ABOVE THESE CURRENTS ON DC UP TO 2b0. WHEN THE MOTOR IS REQUIRED TO BE USED ON AC THEN THE POSITION OF THE BRUSHES IS ALTERED TO SUIT THE PERIODICITY, AND THE RESISTANCE IS ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY. THE INSTRUMENTS COULD HAVE A SUITABLE ENGRAVED MARK TO INDICATE WHICH WAS THE 230 AC POSITION ON THE RESISTANCE, AND THE 110 VOLT DC POSITION WITH IN STRUCTIONS FOR ALTERING THE POSITION OF THE BRUSHES TO SUIT THE AC. From the above explanation it will be evident THAT WHERE YOU DESIRE TO TAKE A DICTATING MACHINE FOR USE WHERE NO ELECTRIC LIGHT IS AVAILABLE, AN ACCUMULATOR OF 30 VOLTS CAN BE PROVIDED, WITH A CAPACITY FOR RUNNING THE Dictaphone for 45 hours before it requires recharging.

Dear Sirs j I am much obliged to you for your letter dated the 18th December 1936 about dictaphones. I have, however, reluctantly come to the conclusion that it is useless for me to proceed in the matter on the grounds of the cost (which I do not think that I could persuade Government to pay) and also of the diffi ulties of using such apparatus (I have much difficulty even over typewriters) in so out of the way and wild a place, where I can get no skilled attention. I am, however, 10 st grateful for the trouble that you have taken in the matter. Yours fait fully, Lieutenant-Colonel Political Agent, Bahrain.D,0. Ho. 370-17/1. The 13th February 1937 T told you that I m s going into the question of asking for a dictaphone for the Bahrain Agency. I fear, however, that the instrument, much as I would like it myself, is hardly suited to conditions ere, firstly, on the score of cost (about £.150 which is high for what would be of the nature of an experiment) and, secondly, on the score of the difficulty of getting skillet attention. At the same time, if the Bahrain Petroleum Company ever instal them and upkeep could be nrrnged with them, J am sure that a dictapnone would be a r&lt; al saving of time to the olitical g nt.
