In all the circwnstances the Marquess of Crewe accepts, though with some reluctance, the view that there would he no advantage in pursuing for the present the question of the fraud committed by M.Menasche in May last; and he is prepared, if the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs concurs, to authorise the proposed further shipment, as recommended by the Government of India, on condition that the goods are sealed by the Warehouse Superintendent and placed by his officials on board the vessel direct from the Ware house, the Political Agent at Maskat being required to satisfy himself that this procedure is duly observed, and that an accur^- ate manifest is drawn up.

Following from Political Agent, Muscat, dated 1st August:— “ Sultan has to-day received letter from French Consul asking leave for Menasche to ship more arms and ammunition from warehouse to Jibuti. No details are given in letter. “ Ordinarily I should propose that His Highness reply that he cannot possibly consider application until a satisfactory reply has been received to his letter of the 9th llajab, or until Menasche produces from his private warehouse one hundred and eight cases of good modern cartridges which will be examined by warehouse superintendent, and shipped under seal with Other arms and ammunition on board steamer by warehouse officials. “ Possibly, however, in view of negotiations re compensation, it may be thought advisable to drop complaint and merely ship goods under proper precautions.” Cox supports the proposal contained in the last paragraph. We agree, and propose to issue instructions accordingly. At present stage of nego tiations little is to be gained by attempting to get satisfaction for Menasche’s misdeeds, while it is to our advantage to reduce stocks.In any further communication on this subject, please quote no. 50645/15. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. f o | J j r,* » ■ ”7 | Foreign Office July 8 th, 1913.

I am to state for the information of the lii-Q, rquess of Gr ewe that Sir E. Grey is disposed to concur in the sugges tions made in the Viceroy’s telegram of July 3rd with regard to the proposed sale to the dheikh of Mohammerah of arms and ammunition shipped to Muscat by Messrs. Kynoch and Me s srs. Laubenburg. While agreeing to the proposals made on this point Sir E. Grey is doubtful whether any useful purpose would now be served by making representations to the French Government respecting the action of the French Consul in connexion with the recent fraud on the part of Menach6.

From Viceroy, 2&amp;th June 1913. Foreign Secret. Please see your telegram dated 11th June regarding Menasche. Sultan of Muscat addressed French Consul and the latter has refused to give a definite reply until the claims between Menasche and Abdur Rahim Jafar, vide correspondence forwarded with Foreign Secretary’s weekly letter No. 12 M., dated 20th March, have been settled. This action appears to afford Sultan fresh justification for forcibly searching Menasche’s premises, and confiscating stocks in question or the equivalent thereof. We consider action of French Consul should be brought to the notice of French Government, in view of the fact that he expressly agreed to conditions which have been broken by Menasche. M e propose to defer recommendations as to what, if any, reply should be made to French Consul by Sultan until we receive instructions from you on our telegram dated 20th June.t From Viceroy, 20th June 1913. Foreign Secret. Your telegram of 11th June. Purchase of arms for Deputy Governor, Bunder Abbas. It is difficult to place order with British firms, as all British stocks in warehouse are consigned to Menasche. Possibly British firms if consulted could suggest a solution, and in any case could they not be informed that it is difficult to assist them until the} 7 change their agent to a British subject, who will deal with the feultan through British Consul ? It appears from this case, and from fact that consignment recently shipped by Menasche to Jibuti contained arms and ammunition of English manufacture, that claims of the French affect British merchandise to con siderable extent. Consequently French claims to compensation would be reduced if British firms withdrew their goods from Menasche.Kxi^-gO 25) In any further communication on this subject, please quote no . 25654/13 • j; Foreign Office and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. 9th* June, 1913 Sir imediate. With reference to your letter P.2179-80 of June 4th. re lating to the Arms Traffic at Muscat, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to inform you that he concurs in the Marquess of Crewe’s suggestion to approve Sir P. Cox’s pro posal that enquiry should be made of the French Consul re garding Monsieur Menasche’s apparent breach of faith; he also concurs in the suggestion that the arms in question should, if possible, be confiscated. Sir E. Grey agrees with His Lordship in thinking that it would be advisable to refuse permission to a local arms dealer to purchase arms and ammunition from French private warehouses for sale to the Deputy Governor, Bunder Abbas; and that it would be better that the latter should be private ly advised to cancel the order, and place it with Messrs. Laubenburg. Sir E. Grey likewise concurs in Lord Crewe’s suggestion le Under Secretary of State India Office. q q p y t o |' 'M / i 13 JUN1913 | SECT. Ml ARY‘S N/JM ■#'**% S* : IH From, Viceroy, 31st May 1913. Foreign Secret. Following telegram lias been received from Political Agent, Maskat, regarding arms. Menasehe was permitted to reship from warehouse for Europe and Jibuti (vide your telegram of 21st January). “ S.S. “ Alumna” sailed yesterday for Karachi, taking for Antwerp 38 cases rifles and 16 cases cartridges and for Jibuti 20 cases of rifles and 300 cartridge boxes. Menasche withdrew 7 from warehouse 48 cases of rifles and 424 cases of ammunition. He has thus, it appears, added 10 cases of rifles and withheld 108 cases of cartridges and apparently never sent them at all, unless he did so by Russian S.S. “ Vesta ” that arrived here yesterday and left the same evening for Aden. Shoik-h directed warehouse superintendent leave the matter of shipment to the Customs Department who seem to have left Menasche free hand. Towell &amp; Co.’s clerk noticed many cases left behind in the boat that took consignment to the “Almeria.” His Highness is much exercised about this non-shipment and told me that he watched French loading a small boat after the “ Almeria ” left but he does not know whether it was sent to the Russian or elsewhere. I do not doubt His Highness’s good faith, though his Customs Department employes cannot be relied upon. I propose that His Highness should address French Consul officially asking for an explanation of discrepancy between number of cases withdrawn from warehouse and numbers shipped. Sultan agrees, but it seems advisable that letter should be sent as soon as possible as it is possible that Menasche has tricked French Consul also.” Though we have hitherto kept French Consul out of transaction, Cox considers it advisable in view of fresh developments to take course suggested by Political Agent. We agree with Sir P. Cox in view of fact that French firm have evaded rules and broken conditions accepted (vide Consul’s letter of 7th March to Sultan forwarded with Foreign Secretary’s weekly letter No. 14 M, dated 3rd April). From subsequent report it appears that fraud committed by Menasche is more extensive than stated by Political Agent. Enquiries are proceeding. We should be glad of early instructions in this case and on points referred to in my telegram of even date. hlfcWL/ X.| 'W: From Viceroy, 31st May 1913. Foreign Secret. Maskat arms. Political Agent at Maskat has made following proposals: (1) That local arms dealer should be permitted to puichase certain arms and ammunition from French private warehouses for sale to Deputy-Crovernor, Bunder Abbas. (2) idiat two Arab merchants should be permitted to purchase from Menasche 750,000 rounds of ammu nition now 7 detained in warehouse. This ammunition, if purchased, would be subject to warehouse rides, and available for requirements of Omanis. Cox telegraphs as follows regarding these proposals :— “ These concessions to expediency and the french dealers go much against the grain to me, but as Government consider that disadvantages involved are more than counterbalanced, they will, I think, wish to adopt present suggestions for further reducing stocks.” Acceptance of first proposal is open to objection that we have consistently refused to allow Sheikhs of Koweit and Mofiammerah to purchase from private stocks, that warehouse rules are being further weakened by each relaxation, and that such action makes it difficult to reply to complaints of inconsistency and differentiation in favour of French, such as that put forward by Messrs. Kynoch, Limited. On the other hand, as we have now a fair measure of control over imports, and as His Majesty’s Government recently decided (vide your telegram of 14th March last) that advantage of reducing stocks in Maskat outweighed objections mentioned above, presume that proposal should be approved, as destination of arms appeai-s unobjectionable. As regards (2) we see no strong objection to the proposal, as ammunition will be disposed of under warehouse rules.I Enclosv &lt;,\J 14 43 ■i-O iVJAi i C\ ft t v vr ,U' p L Telegram, No. 432 A , dated the 25th (received 26th) April 1913.

I should have thought that His Highness the Sultan could have found means through one of his arms-dealing friends to sound Menasche in a way, which need not have let him in for a rebuff, and would have afforded more chance of success than the course followed, but, in the circumstances explained, I presume that His Majesty’s Government will wish Mons. Menasche to be permitted to re-export his arms, without passing them through the ware ouse. I must admit, however, that the proceeding presents itself to me as a sacrifice or principle to expediency, which is weakening to the Sultan’s position and ours, ■ and inconvenient from other points of view.

Your telegram of 14th March. Maskat arms. The suggestions communicated in my telegram of the 12th March were based on following considerations First, arms in question are in open market, having paid customs duty. We have consistently declined to permit Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit from making (? to make) purchases from these arms on ground that they would leave Maskat without the warehouse mark, and that if permission were given to export arms in this way, rules introduced by Sultan with our support would be stultified. Secondly, attitude of French merchants has weakened considerably owing to long delay in settlement, and their desire to realise their money, and it seems possible that they might he tempted to accept Sultan’s terms in respect of arms in private godowns, having accepted them through medium of French Consul in regard to arms in warehouse. 'This view receives support from following telegram, dated 20th March, received from Cox. “ Craufurd’s Arms Traffic diary, dated 15th March, reports that Gognyer’s son has just left Muscat in a very despondent mood. Craufurd further states that Menachi’s stock, which he estimates at 10,000 weapons, is mostly composed of Sniders and similar weapons which he has failed.to find market for locally, and he has apparently no ammunition for the above rifles. Craufurd believes that if he were dealt with directly by the Sultan he would willingly pass arms through the warehouse if the Sultan, on the grounds that they have already paid duty, exempted them from further charges. “ By this pro forma compliance the principles of the rules would be preserved, and no ground afforded to other traders to complain of differential treatment.” In the circumstances we agree with Sir P. Cox, that it would be advisable to try course suggested in our telegram of the 12th March in the first instance, omitting the intervention of French Consul. Inconvenient weakening of rules which would be difficult to explain to other interested parties would thus be avoided. Further suggestion that Rule 1 should be held to apply to arms now intended for sale to public within Sultan s dominions, and not to arms thus reshipped seems inconsistent with attitude which we have adopted regarding application of Rule 4 to arms transhipped m Maskat territorial waters (vide your telegram of 18th March). In event of attempt failing recourse could be had to procedure which you suggest. M e lecognise objections to making a demand which it may be necessary 7 to withdiaw from, but the chances of success appear sufficient to justify experiment.DRAFT TELEGRAM. India F.O.C.C.

Powell &amp; 0o.\-Agents, Hamburg-America line desire to ship by middle of April arms and ammunition belonging to Louis Dieu &amp; Co., at present stowed in private godown, to Djibouti and Antwerp. We agree with Cox that the Sultan should be advised to inform French Consul of the request and to say if the Agent of Louis Dieu will first comply with Rule 1, and that if French Consul will certify that arms so transferred from the private godown to the warehouse are the bond fide property of the firm and represent whole of their stock in Oman, then Suitan will waive penalty under Rule 2 and permit re-shipment as in case, referred to in Maskat letter No. 18, 26th January, copy of which was sent you with Foreign Secretary’s weekly letter, 13th February 1913.

I would invite a reference to the enclosure to letter dated 3rd January 1913 from the French Consul, Maskat, to His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, forwar ded under cover of this office endorsement No. 8-9, dated 6th January 1913.

Of these 8 c/s, 4 were delivered in error by the Customs Superintendent to Ali Moosa, who, His Highness and the Superintendent of Customs assure me, admits his responsibility for these four c/s. M ith regard to the remaining 4, the Superintendent of Customs contends that they were short landed and that the Hamburg-Amerika Company is responsible H is exceed ingly unfortunate that there should he this trifling discrepancy hut I think it well to mention it, though I hope to find it a mere matter or detail, easily adjustable. 3.

Cox, I.A., K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Resident and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to Foreign Department telegram No. 52-C., dated 24th January 1913, I have the honour to submit herewith the translation of a letter which will issue today from His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, to the address of the French Consul, Maskat, on the case between Menasche and Abdul Hahim Jafir. This translation will be found as enclosure 1 to this report. 2. Since my letter No. 5, dated 6th January 1913, was despatched to you, His Highness the Sultan of Maskat has been good enough to show me three more letters from the French Consul, Maskat, of which I have prepared translations which I am submitting to you as enclosure No. 2 to this report. It is not easy to follow the details of these various cases which overlap each other, more specially as I am anxious to avoid arousing the susceptibilities of His Highness in cases which are within his competence where my position is a somewhat delicate one. I would invite special attention to the last letter of the series where at first sight it struck me as somewhat high handed action on the part of the French Consul to support Monsieur Menasche in withholding payment of Customs dues in order to extort somewhat shadowy claims by Monsieur Menasche against His Highness’ Customs and His Highness’ subjects. On fuller enquiry, however, it would seem that, on the “ Beati possidentes ” principle, there is not much to complain of as Abdur Hahim Jafir, His Highness’subject, admittedly holds 24,000 francs’ worth of goods belonging to Monsieur Menasche’s principals, for which he has not paid. Monsieur Menasche further claims against him for about Hs. 5,675 against which Abdul Hahim wishes to write off so much earnest money, while m addition there is a matter of a claim against the arms dealer, Wram, for another Hs. 5,000 approximately. 3. I venture therefore to express the opinion that we can well afford to let matters rest with the despatch to the French Consul of enclosure No. 1 and await.further developments. 4. A copy of this letter, with its accompaniments, is being forwarded to the Hon’ble the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. Sub-Enclosure 1.

As, for my part, I have given him leave that he should pay it to Menasche and he asks from you that you also should give him leave to pay it to him. And your servant Menasche wants to go to Basra and he would be exces sively obliged to Your Highness if you would favour him with a reply about all his claims and particularly about the goods which he wishes to send to Jibuti. And we have informed him that he should pay the duty which the Superintendent of Customs has claimed from him and to-day or to-morrow he will go to pay that sum. Usual ending. A.

And the two were present with me and Menasche said that it lias not been cleared and at the time of his presence for the purpose of the account between him and Abdul Karim it was clear to him that Abdul Karim did not intend to settle the account which referred to Abdul Rahim nor that which referred to YYram and when he ascertained this he refrained from paying the customs account which is for 1,682 dollars, so that Abdul Karim may consent to the payment of the aforesaid sums and Menasche has been delayed from his journey by these hindrances which have been prolonged without result. Now as Your Majesty wishes from us the compulsion of Menasche to pay the aforesaid sum and likewise we ask of your kindness that you should compel Abdul Karim to pay the sums already men tioned and that the payment on both sides should be simultaneous and Menasche says that two boxes of cartridges have been spoilt at the customs which he and Abdul Karim have seen and he desires from him evidence so that the company or someone else should pay for the loss and Abdul Karim does not agree thereto, therefore we ask from your kindness that you should order an enquiry about that and whence this damage came about and be good enough to inform us of the result and may you remain thanked and salaam.

The reply of my colleague contains nothing new and it would seem that « a correspondence of this kind, in which His Highness puts forward one view of the case ^ to which the Prench Consul rejoins with a directly contrary opinion may continue indefinitely without other result than the undesirable one of fur ther embittering the relations between them. If, however, silence may he inter- \ preted as consent to my colleague’s views and a reply is considered necessary, I would suggest that His Highness might say that Ahdur Rahim is ready, and has always been ready, to pay the Pr. 24,000 which he admits are due from him to Monsieur Menasche and that, with regard to the other matters involved, he and the Prench Consul must, for the present at any rate, unfortunately agree to differ. 3.

After compliments. —I have been honoured in the receipt of your honoured letter, dated the 18th: Safar 1331-H., and your friend has understood what you have mentioned and I have been excessively astonished at its contents and firstly the custom, but the custom is not a rule upon anybody unless that it is founded upon rule. And the only rule is the treaty between the two Govern ments the Omani and the Prench, no other than it on our subjects. And what you say in the matter of handing over goods without a hill of lading, Your Majesty said that the Customs Department chooses among the merchants and that in their view the more worthy is he who does not hold the bill of lading and the goods will he delivered into the hand of him who has not the right of enjoy ment therein. And your Honour said further if injury falls on your subjects from that procedure, it does not concern the Omani Government. Then is the Customs Department independent and what Customs Department of the Customs Departments is not responsible for such acts and what post office of the post offices hands over the amount of an order to one who is not the hearer thereof ?MM Secondly I have no knowledge that the question in the matter of the new beconaiy, J. nave &amp; I onlv kn0 w and have clearly informed Your arrangement is u ^ G i orious Government has not consented to the New arrangement. Further the claim which is between Menasche and Ahdur Rahim has no connection with this arrangement. Then as the result of all that s iTn^iWc for me to accept the want of the decision from you on account of this arrangement. Then if Ahdul Karim is a merchant of credit as you say, ihen ™ can Pay his debts and your Honour has full authority over him so that he should pay t^e old debt to the Customs and the Customs should pay it to Menasche P But the new debt since Abdur Rahim has broken the conditions of the promise through breach of faith then the goods and the earnest money belong to Mon“eur Menasche according to the rules of the two Governments.

French Consul has asked Sultan for permission for Menachi, French arms dealer, to ship portion of arms and ammunition now in warehouse to Europe or Jibuti, without prejudice to Menachi’s claim for compensation. We see no objection to reshipment of arms, and Sultan would he glad to be rid of them. But question of customs duty arises. As there _ is nothing in French Treaty to justify exemption, and as warehouse is not bonded warehouse for customs purposes, but storehouse for regulation of arms, trade-duty should he claimed. This will make clear character of warehouse. As regards compensation, Sultan might reply that he has never admitted any claim for compensation, and can say nothing on the subject.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100034923818.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/238/2</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100034923818.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/238/2</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 868/1912 Pt 5 'Arms traffic: Muscat trade.
