Most of the truck’s cab is cropped out of the photograph’s right-hand edge, so that the truck’s make and model is not discernible. The truck is stationary and stands on a flat, bare surface. Lying on the ground alongside the truck is an additional piece of metal piping. A series of black circles to the left-hand side of the photograph may indicate further pipes lying alongside each other on the ground. Above these possible pipes is a faint vertical line; possibly a mast or pylon in the distance.</abstract><typeOfResource>still image</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Photograph</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100071610916.0x000006#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
