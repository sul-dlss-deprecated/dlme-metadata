P art I.— GENERAL SUMMARY. 1—OMAN—MUSCAT COAST. The Report for the year, forming Part II of this compilation, has been prepared by Major J. Hayes Sadler. Political tranquillity has generally prevailed as regards the Sultan's authority, which has not, however, been sufficiently strong to suppress inter-tri bal feuds. These have been active and have led to numerous raids and repri sals, resulting in a good deal of bloodshed. In an attack by the Yal Saad on the Ahl Dhahireh at Mubrah early in the year, the loss in killed and wounded on the two sides amounted to about 160. Hameyd-bin-Salim, a marauder, better known as Kurta, began raiding in the Sharkeyeh in September, and in February advanced towards Kurryat. The force there was strengthened by His Highness, and the tribes having closed the passes, Kurta turned back and subsequently sued for pardon. The definite refusal of Sayyid Abdul Aziz to accept the pension proffered to him was communicated to His Highness the Sultan in October. Sayyid Abdul Aziz has, however, continued to reside in India. Notwithstanding the strenuous efforts made for their recovery, no trace -as been found of the seven slaves mentioned in last year's report for Muscat as having been imported from Africa. Trouble was threatened in the outlying Muscat dependency of Gwadur, whither a large number of slaves of the Binds of Mand in Mekran had fled for refuge from their masters. The presence of these refugees being a source of danger, as likely to incite their former masters to violence for their recovery, their removal to India was in every way encouraged, and a large number were accordingly conveyed there. An attempted breach of the maritime peace was visited with a fine on the offending Shaikh, who had carried an armed party by sea to prosecute a claim to certain property at Shaam ; and in a case of the kidnapping of an African passenger in a native craft, the vessel was confiscated and the nakhoda im- prisoned, the kidnapped man being released.6 administration report on the persian gulf political A very pleasing incident in the annals of Oman was the prompt and effective action taken by His Highness the Sultan for the relief of the victims in the loss by fire of the S.S. Khiva off Marbat, on the South Arabian Coast, in April. His Highness's humane conduct has received the recognition of the Government of India. To it and to the shelter and protection afforded by the local Shaikhs and friendly tribesmen, the safety in life and property of over 1,000 persons was largely due. Excluding specie, an increase appears in the total value of the trade of Muscat. As regards imports and exports, the position of the preceding year has been exactly reversed during the year under review, the imports, especially from India, having decreased, while the exports have largely increased. 2.—OMAN PIRATE COAST. This coast was visited in the end of April by the Resident in H. M. S. Sphinx. Cholera spread from the interior to the coast at the end of the hot season, and though its prevalence was not for very long, there was considerable mortal ity, especially at Eas-el-Khymah, Shargah, Debai, and Abu Dthabi; it had disappeared by the end of October. An interference with the disposal by the Hindus, according to their reli gious rites, of the body of one of their community who had died at Abu Dthabi was brought to notice. The Chief endeavoured to justify the action of his son while in temporary charge of affairs during his absence. This conten tion could not be admitted; and the Chief being required to make restitution of the fee which had been levied, refunded the money to the Hindus. At the instance of the Chief of Abu Dthabi an attack was made on Hair, one of the towns of the Kowasim, by the Shoohooh tribe. After some of the people of the town had been killed, its fort was destroyed. Debai has been at enmity with both Shargah and E-as-el-Khymah. The trouble between the two tribes, in connection with the Marrars, which was re ferred to in last year's reports, continued, and the efforts to arrange matters through the Residency Agent were unavailing, the Shargah Chief being in a laro-e measure responsible for the failure. Other differences arose and resulted in openly declared hostilities in November, into which the people of Ajman were also drawn on the side of Debai. Both parties finally had recourse to the good offices of the Chief of Abu Dthabi, who, in March, effected a reconciliation, arranging for a settlement of their mutual claims, and appointing agents to carry 0 it out. The claims concerning the Marrars were excluded from this settlement, and were left to be dealt with under the authority of the Resident. The Shargah Chief had not evinced a conciliatory attitude with regard to this case with Debai, and appeared disposed to avoid meeting the Resident. An assembly for a full investigation of the claims was, however, insisted on, and at this, under the firm and judiciously exerted influence of Mr. Gaskin, Assistant Resident, a satisfactory adjustment was made. Advantage was also taken of this visit to exact from the Shargah Chief the balance of a fine imposed on one of his subjects for importing a slave in November 1892. The conduct of the Chief, altogether, had not been quite satisfactory, and the complimentary gifts usually bestowed on these visits were withheld. A complaint was made by the Ajman Chief of his boat having been fired upon by the people of Haireh. The charge was denied, and it has not been possible to fully substantiate it. There is, however, reason to believe that some demonstration of the kind was made, and as such an act would be a breach of the maritime truce, a serious warning was given.residency and muscat political agency for the year 1893-94. 7 Ras-el-Khymali territory was liable to raids from Debai in consequence of the hostilities between the latter and Shargah, which have been referred to. It was also threatened with an attack by the Chief of Bokha in the same con nection. No redress has yet been obtained in the complaints by Has-el-Khymah subjects referred to in the last report; the Persian Government has not even furnished a reasonable answer to these charges of outrage at Bunder Abbas and Khargu, which, there is reason to believe, are well founded. 3—BAHRAIN. A new tax on divers and pearl boats, imposed by the Chief of Bahrain, caused much discontent. The result of the year's pearl-fishing showed a great decline, the take being only about one-third of the average. This was mainly due to the outbreak of cholera, which appeared in July and soon became very severe, the mortality rising at one time to 150 daily. The epidemic had ceased by the end of August, when some 7,000 persons in all are said to have fallen victims to the disease. This number is probably exaggerated. In August the Kaim-Makam of El-Katif again caused notices to be posted up at that place asserting Turkish sovereignty over Bahrain ; and the Wali of Busrah, on a protest being made against such pretension, appeared disposed to support the Kaim-Makam's action. The Porte, however, withdrew from this position, claiming only to treat the people of Bahrain as Turkish subjects within Ottoman territories. On this point the right to extend British protection to the subjects of the Shaikh, whenever occasion might demand, was maintained. H. M. S. Lapwing was sent to Bahrain to restore general confidence in November. There were some complaints of the treatment of Bahrain boats visitino 1 El-Katif. Shaikh Salman, son of the Chief of Bahrain, died near Riadh in August while on his return from a pilgrimage to Mecca. In March last heavy rain fell in Bahrain and caused much damage to pro perty and houses, six or seven men being killed by the fall of houses. 4.—EL-HASA AND OJAIR. In consequence of the reports in June of a large tribal gathering of the Beni-Hajar, Al-Murrah, and Mandsir, to attack the Beni-Khalid, it was necessary to provide a guard ot Turkish troops to escort the El-Hasa caravan for Ojair. The projected raid collapsed, the tribesmen returning with little booty. In February 1894 the Bedouins of the Dowasir tribe raided a caravan on the road between El-Hasa and El-Katif, and carried off some goods ; on learn ing, however, that the caravan was escorted by a man of their tribe, the robbers made restitution. 5.—EL-KATIF. Cholera broke out at El-Katif and lasted for over a month in July and August. At the commencement of the outbreak, the death rate was 10 to 15 daily ; it subsequently rose to 50 or 60 daily. The Wali of Busrah visited El-Katif on his way back to his head-quarters from El-Bidaa in May. The people of the place having petitioned against the Kaim-Makam and complained against his malpractices, he was removed from his post in J uly.8 auminls'l'ration repout on the persian gulf political The new Governor, Eaouf Effendi, did not, however, assume charge of the duties of bis post tillJanuary. In January, the Turkisli gun-boat M ujc I g J i -Rasdn airivcd at Ivatif witb 90 military reliefs ; 30 of these were landed at Katif for Ojaii, and the re mainder were conveyed to Katr. In September 1893 a Kowait boat, wliicb was beached at Katif, \\as at tacked by fifteen robbers. In the struggle which ensued the crew were wounded and put to flight, and one of the robbers was killed. The robbers then seized the arms and effects of the crew, together with Rs. 50 belonging to the nakhoda, and decamped. They were pursued by the Customs people of Katif, who, however, failed to overtake them. 6.—EL-KATR. In last year's report, the action fought near Wajbah between the Arabs under Shaikh Jasim and the Turkish troops under the Wall of Busrah, was noticed. According to the information obtained, the Wali marched on the night of the 25th March with the object of surprising Wajbah, where Shaikh Jasim was residing. In this he failed, and the Arabs collecting, attacked and defeated in detail the Turkish troops, who had scattered in pursuit of small bodies of the enemy. The Turks were finally obliged to retreat; and after considerable loss, reached the shelter of the fort at El-Bidaa under the guns of the Merrikh, which afterwards fired on the town. The total Arab loss, including women and children, who, being driven out into the desert, perished from exposure, has been stated'at 420, which is probably an outside estimate. On the Turkish side the loss has been set down at 40 to 100 ; and as both parties may be sup posed, though from different motives, to be inclined to reduce the number, the higher figure is perhaps not very wide of the mark, excluding some of the wounded sent to Busrah. Por the collision the Wali would seem to have been responsible, he having attempted to carry matters with a high-hand, and to have found himself un equal to the crisis he had provoked. After these hostilities the Arabs, abandoning El-Bidaa, dispersed into vari ous villages, and Shaikh Jasim returned to the fort at Wajbah. The Turkish sun-boat Merrikh remained off El-Bidaa, and a punitive expedition on the part of the Ottoman Government was expected. Affairs being in this position, the Resident was instructed to proceed to the spot in view to arranging, if possible, a settlement, and arrived off El-Bidaa in the end of April. Visits were exchanged with the Wali, who, how ever, in the absence of instructions from his Government, declined to discuss affairs or to recognize any intervention. Meantime, the ii. I. M. S. Lawrence, arriving with news of the dismissal of the Wali, Colonel Talbot felt no longer under the necessity of consulting him, and proceeded to Wakrah, where he had an interview w r ith Shaikh Jasim. The attitude of the Shaikh was very temperate ; and while maintaining that he had been forced into hostilities, he undertook to accept any settlement that might be arranged for him, and urged that this might be brought about as early as possible, in order to prevent the loss of the whole pearling season. Eortunately, temperate and pacific counsels prevailed with the Ottoman Government ; the Nakeeb of Busrah, a friend of Shaikh Jasim, was deputed to Katr and being the bearer of very moderate demands, was able to arrange matters satisfactorily. A sense of security was thus restored, the Arabs return ed to El-Bidaa, and pearl-fishing was resumed.fs —v RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY POK THE TEAR 1898-94 The final result of these events has been the replacement of Shaikh Jasim rtTfiMaa Sh T mby t Tmk - Sh 0fflC:aL With re Sard to the garrison at El-Bidaa, Shaikh Jasim has objected that it has been maintained at a strength largely in excess of what had been promised. 7.—PERSIAN ARABISTAN. His Eoyal Highness the Hisam-us-Sultaneh remained throughout the r a '' a , S Governor-General of Arabistan, and was re-appointed in Pebrnary last toi a further period of one year. His administration has been, on the whole, successful, and the country has enjoyed comparative tranquillity owing to his tact and moderation in the treatment of the tribes. Timely concessions to the wishes of the tribes of the district averted hostilities in the early part of the ^ i ^. e P rmci P al Chaab tribes had deposed Shaikh Abdullah Khan, Governor of halahieli, and appointed Shaikh Jafir Khan in his place ; but the Muez-us- Sultaneb, Governor of Mobammerab, who is not well disposed towards them tried to support the deposed Governor; and the Prince Governor, who was un aware of the tribal feeling, re-appointed him. In the face, however of the hostile attitude of the tribes. His Royal Highness cancelled the appointment : and in January last, when be visited Mohammerah, confirmed Shaikh Jafir in the appointment. The crops between Ahwaz and Shuster, and on the Lower Karun, were good but the export of grain was prohibited. ' There were several outbreaks of epidemic disease : cholera, small-pox, and remittent fever prevailed at Mohammerah and on the Upper Karun between June and October 1893, and considerable mortality attended them. Quarantine was maintained at Mohammerah against arrivals from Busrah and^ other places in Turkish territory during the months of June and July Early in 1892 the Turkish authorities at Busrah had proposed to estab lish a quarantine station at Pao, to prevent the evasion by travellers for Busrah of quarantine fees by landing at Mohammerah and proceeding by land or river. The proposal was opposed by the British and Russian Delegates on the Board of Health at Constantinople, and the question was finally suspended until the assembling of the Commission for the revision of the Sanitary tariff. Since October 1893 the Turkish Customs authorities at Pao have con stantly stopped native craft bound for, or sailing from, Mohammerah, claiming duty on their cargoes at the same rate to which goods imported into, or exported from, Turkey are liable. Among the victims of these exactions, which are contrary to the second article of the Treaty of Erzeroum of 1847, were two British Indian boats which were bound for Mohammerah, and which paid the duty under protest. The whole question has been made the subject of re ference, but the 1 urkish authorities still refuse to recognise the anchorage off Mohammerah as under Persian jurisdiction. The question does not appear to have received at Tehran the attention that might have been expected, possibly because the Turkish Customs authorities at Pao have not, apparently, enforced their demands in a regular or systematic manner upon all boats, but upon such only as have submitted to their exactions. In May 1893 the Naseri Company publicly announced that they had opened the river Diz to traffic and had placed their steamer Sma on it. The Sta, however, made only one trip to Kut Bunder, a place about ten hours' distance from Dizful by caravan, On the return voyage the vessel was nearly wrecked, and had to leave behind a barge which she had taken in tow.administration report on the persian gulp political 10 III July 1893 there was a fanatical demonstratioa against Messrs^ Lynch s house at Shuster. The day of this ocoun-ence was the 10th day of Mohu.um ntu1 tihe oouseauenee might have been serious, as about 3,000 people sur rounded the house, threatening the lives of the inmates. The Prince Governor bein' informed took prompt measures by the despatch of an anno oice which quickly dispersed the mob. and a catastrophe was thus averted Some sort of complaint appears to have been made by those responsible oi this riot, but it can only be regarded as an attempt to avert by a^' cipating it with an aecusation. An enquiry, conducted by the Vice-Consul of Mohammerah, ascertained the true tacts, and a written disclaimer of any cause of complaint against Messrs. Lynch's Agent was given by the Deputy Gov- ernor of Slmster. In November 1893 cattle -disease of a mild type prevailed on the Karun from Mohammerah to Ameirah ; it travelled to Falah.eh and the islands of Abadan and Khezr, and to the Turkish side of the Shatt-ul-Arab. In December 1893, a gale, accompanied by heavy rain, passed over t e dis- trict about Ahwaz, where the river rapidly rose 20 feet, overflowing and oo - in' much of the country. The telegraph poles were blown down msev places, and the line interrupted for a week. The river subsided about the early part of January last. , , - The question of accommodation for Messrs. Lynch at Ahwaz, which had been long pending, was decided, and an agreement was drawn up m February between the representatives of the Nizam-es-Sultaneh and Messrs Lynch, and was forwarded to Tehran for ratification. In March last the Resident, accom panied by the Extra Assistant, proceeded on tour up the Karun as ai as Shuster, and at Ahwaz saw the ground marked for the buildings. The traffic on the Karun is slowly increasing; and though steamers seem to have done slightly better than in the previous year, they still work at a loss ; and until the land communications in the interior above Shuster are improved, and more carrying capacity is provided on the upper river, the volume o e trade can hardly be materially increased. 8.— FAUS AND PERSIAN COAST. The Nizam-us -Sultaneh was Governor-General of Pars throughout the year • his brother, Saad-ul-Mulk, was Governor of Bushire and the Gulf ports, but spent but a small part of his time within his jurisdiction, only returning to Bushire in January after a long absence at Shiraz. The year closed with the re-appointment of His Boyal Highness the Rukn -ud-Dowlah as Governor-General of Pars, and of the Kawam-ul-Mulk as Governor of Bushire and the Gulf ports. The arrival of the latter, however, being delayed, Haji Mirza Abdulla Khan was appointed as Deputy Governor, and reached Bushire to take up his duties after a short delay. An embargo on the export of wheat was published in May, and continued nominally in force till the following January, when it was removed. This measure, which is of periodical recurrence, though injuriously affecting the regular operations of the more important merchants, who are Europeans, is very generally recognized as being practically ineffectual. Any real restraint on export from the rich corn-producing sea-board tracts from Bushire towards the mouth of the Euphrates would be most difficult ; and even if seriously intended or attempted, would be hardly practicable, in view of the fact that scarcely any other means than by sea are available for disposing of the pro duce. A thinly veiled and gw^si-surreptitious export is understood to be cai- ried on at Bushire itself during these embargoes.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1893-94 11 In July a scheme forjhe taxation of foreigners engaged in retail trades and industries was annonnced by the Persian Government, and has since come into force. The districts near Bushire were again subject to some trouble and disorder. Khan Ali Khan of Bunder E/ig having farmed Angali and other villages in Dashtistan was resisted by the inhabitants, and Angali holding out after the submission of the others, was attacked with the support of a gun from Bushire. In Tangistan there was a still more serious conflict, and Hyder Khan, though assisted by a detachment of Persian soldiers and a gun, failed against the Tangseri tribe who, armed with Martini-Henry rifles, compelled the soldiers to retreat under their steady fire. Cholera prevailed in various parts and seriously threatened Bushire, It appeared at Basrah in May and later at Mohammerah, and spread on the Arab coast as well as on the Persian side of the Gulf and its islands. Erom the coast it advanced to the places on the route leading from Bushire to Shiraz, and thus Bushire became liable to invasion by the disease both by land and water, its communications by both being very active. Quarantine was established against Busrah in June, and subsequently against arrivals from any infected port, and, though the measures adopted were framed with the utmost consideration for the interests of trade, was eminently successful. In consequence of the spread of the epidemic to the neighbouring dis tricts, quarantine was imposed on arrivals by land in September. Special pre cautions were also taken to secure the purity of the water-supply, the condi tions of which— drinkable water being obtainable only from a limited number of wells at a distance from the town—lent themselves to these efforts. The re sults were remarkably successful, only one case of the disease occurring in the town and a few on board ships or at the quarantine stations, and this not withstanding that a very severe type of the disease prevailed at Ahmedi, only 20 miles distant, and at other places along the Shiraz route. It is noteworthy that the entire responsibility of devising and controlling the measures to protect perhaps the most important port of Persia against a terrible danger, was resigned to a foreign element, for it was solely with Surgeon- Captain Lumsden, Residency Surgeon, and his subordinate, that this burden, in a professional sense, rested, no other medical aid being piovided. The Persian authorities readily accepted the suggestions made, and supported the measures declared to be necessary, and the Kesidency Surgeon s leport has recorded that they ' have given every assistance in carrying out the quaran tine work effectively and without friction.' The highest praise was also given to Haji Ali Dubash, one of the Port officials, for the excellent woik done by him in carrying out quarantine legulations. His Excellency Rear-Admiral W. R. Kennedy visited Bushire en route to Busrah and Baghdad in March, and was received with salutes on arrival by H. I M S. VeJ V oli 8 &gt; and, on landing, by a battery onshore. His Excel- lency was visited by the Saad-ul-Mulk, whose visit was returned. Affairs in Shiraz and the neighbouring districts continued m a very disturbed state. It appeared that at the beginning of the year order had been restored by the newly appointed Beglar-Begi in the city ; but the sup pressed popular excitement broke out sgain in an acute form m the middle of Mav, when the populace tumultuously assembled at the Telegraph Office and insisted on transmitting a petition to His Ma3esty the Shah regarding the high price of bread, the fall in value of copper com, and the presence of the Baharloos and Arab tribes in the town. Feeling also ran^very12 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL high against the Kawam-ul-Mulk; and the people, not satisfied with the as surances they received of his departure, assumed a threatening attitude. Matters quieted a few days later on the departure of the Kawam-ul-Mulk ; but continued high prices soon again caused a ferment, and threats were posted up that the Telegraph Office would be again beseiged. Some fear of a riot was again revived in November. Locusts made their first appearance in spring and were followed by larger flights; the injury they did to the crops about Shiraz is said to liave been verv extensive ; the wheat indeed was reported to have been almost destroyed. Young locusts again appeared in November, and very great damage was done to the crops during the early spring of this year. Much trouble was caused by the turbulence of the Baharloos, who were noted in last year's report as having gone into open revolt, and by other Arab and nomad tribes. The appointment of the Sebam-ul-Mulk to the position with these tribes formerly occupied by the Kawam-ul-Mulk, was very unwel come to them ; but he appears to have dealt with these unruly spirits with a strong hand. He conducted an expedition which surprised the camp of Reza Khan by night, killing several of his followers and capturing others ; Heza Khan himself, who escaped wounded, died the next day. Two robberies of the Persian post were reported. Very great damage was caused by heavy rain and floods in Shiraz and districts. In the middle of December the rain is described as heavier than any remembered in recent years; the houses in Shiraz were much injured and the district of Abadeh to the north suffered terribly. In the Pasa district south-east, the efcfect of the floods was still more severe, some villages bein® almost annihilated. Towards the end of .February, Shiraz and the neighbour hood were visited by an earthquake which caused some injury to life and pro perty. This was followed by a deluge of rain, which destroyed a very large number of houses in the city. At Lar in May a colporteur of the British and Foreign Bible Society was maltreated, and all his books were burned by order of the Mujtabid, against whom the Governor declared himself powerless to obtain redress for the victim. The case of a British Indian subject who was robbed of some 26,000 Krans worth of property, chiefly pearls, at Naband, was noticed in last year's report. Pearls to the value of about 3,388 Krans were recovered, and after much needless delay and complication, were handed over to the owner named Maghu. The result of the dilatory proceedings taken by the authorities is that up to the present, notwithstanding the orders of the Government, the efforts to obtain more complete indemnification for the unfortunate man have been fruitless. A Pathan caravan, some of the leaders being British subjects, was at tacked by the Baharloos and robbed, and four men killed. This occurred before the beginning of the year; but up to the present about half of the camels only have been recovered, no further compensation for the loss of life and pro perty having yet been obtained. iever of a severe type appeared near Bassidore in November, and caused about thirty deaths. Heavy rain at the close of the year did much injury to houses and date groves. Failure attended the boring operation for petroleum of the Mining Rights Corporation, a depth of over 700 feet being reached without a trace of oil being found.residency and musca.t polttica.l agency foe, the year 1893-94, Survey operations in view to connecting the Telegraph at Jask with liuuder Abbas were undertaken in pursuance of the desire of the Persian authorities for telegraphic communication witli Bunder Abbas; the Surveyor, however, encountered some obstruction in the Bashakird country, and it is believed that the work has not been completed. A charge of most oppressive and unwarrantable treatment in the case of a boat from Ras-el-Khymah, on the Arab coast, was made against the then Deputy Governor of Bunder Abbas just before the beginning of the year. Another outrage on a boat from Ejas-el-Khymah was complained of as having been committed at Khargu, where a young slave lad was violently carried off. These eases were alluded to in last year's report, but redress has not yet been given. Cases of this kind are very likely to lead to reprisals on the part of the Arabs, and the delay and difficulty in getting justice is therefore much to be regretted. Other outrages were the plunder or capture of Bahrain boats off Bisatin in April by the Bani-i-Malik tribe, and off Bistano in September by the followers of the Chief of Assalu, both occurring within the jurisdiction of the Governor of Lar. In both these cases, as also in the case of piracy at Bunder Tibbin mentioned in last year's report, no result has yet attended the application for redress. In April the huglah of a British Indian subject, which was wrecked near Minab, was plundered by the local Baluchis; the Persian authorities at Bushire professed to have recovered a portion of the plundered wreckage and paid compensation for the rest, but it is feared that this has not been done. Ihe difficulties connected with the Customs question at Bunder Abbas, in relation to Kerman and other places in the interior, were revived, and there ha^e been constant complaints of demands being repeated on the transit of goods to inland jurisdiction, notwithstanding the payment of the full treaty rate of duty at the port of entry. 9.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN AND MEKRAN. Bampur continued under the Governorship of Sirteep Zain-ul-Abadin Khan during the year. Sirdar Muhammad Ali Khan, who had for many years been Governor of Balm and Gwetter, was removed from his post and replaced by Mowladad Khan; but not long afterwards he intimated to the Native Assistant at G-vvadur that the Persian Governor of Kerman had reinstated him. I he difficulties arising out of the mutual complaints of raids and violence on both sides of the Perso-Baluch frontier were dealt with in the course of the tour in Mekran by the Political Agent, South Eastern Baluchistan, who obtained fiom the liinds an undertaking to refrain from all raids over the border pending an enquiry into, and settlement of, the matter at issue between them and their neighbours. The Persian Government was asked to restrain its subjects from aggression in pursuance of the arrangement that had been arrived at. Shaikh Hassan, Zabit of Minab, took a large force aided by Mir Abdul ISabi, Chief of Jask, against the small Tahirzai tribe inhabiting Khotak in the Biyaban district, which had become very lawless. The tribe was attacked at Surag on 31st August, with trifling loss on both sides, and subsequently secured immunity, and permission to reside at Khotak, on payment of 400 tomans. Later they emigrated to Bashagird. In September an affray occurred at Jask between the fishermen of the place and the Persian troops; and the former being joined by the other inhabitants, beleaguered the fort in which the soldiers took refuge. Further violence was averted by the intervention of the Assistant Superintendent of li •1 %m ju ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL the Telegraph, who induced the fishermen to retire by promising to report the state of affairs; and on his representation, the desirability in the interests of peace, of the removal of the Deputy Governor Ghulam Reza Beg, having been brought to the notice of the authorities at Bushire by the Resident, that official was replaced by a Military Yavar. A most unwarrantable interference by the local Persian authorities of Dizak and Bampur in the affairs of certain British Indian subjects had a de plorable result. A Guru, who is also a trader, having claimed a Hindu girl in marriage, seems to have appealed for aid in securing her, to the Persian autho rities, and Sardar Muhammad Khan of Dizak thereupon caused the girl and her family to be seized and carried to Sib, where the former was made over to the Guru. The unhappy girl died the same night, and the circumstances have a very grave aspect. Sirteep Zain-ul-Abadin of Bampur would seem not to be free from suspicion of concern in the proceedings in this case. Enquiries have been made as far as possible; Lieutenant Sykes, who was travelling in those parts, investigated the matter, and the Guru was summoned to Karachi for examination. The accounts furnished by the Persian authorities have been recklessly contradictory, and it has not been possible to clear up the facts attending the girl's death, which has been attributed to poison given by the girl's mother, to hardships in the course of the forcible abduction to Sib, and to natural causes. There seems little prospect of sufficiently trustworthy evidence being obtained for formal proceedings against the Guru. No result has been reached in the case of the abduction of the mother and sister of a Telegraph line-man at Jask, notwithstanding the orders noted in last year's report as having been issued by the Persian Government. The difficulty of finding Dadullah, who was guilty of the abduction, has constantly been put forward to account for the failure in this case. The women have not been restored. A destructive fire in April 1893 rendered a thousand persons homeless at Gwadur. The loss of property, chiefly belonging to Arab subjects, was esti mated at Rs. 78,000. The position with regard to the escaped slaves who have sought refuge at Gwadur, has continued to be a source of anxiety to His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and his 'Wali at Gwadur. The demands of the Rinds for the resto ration of these refugees have constantly been renewed, and have at times been threatening; but the force at the disposal of the Wali having been strength ened, he has been enabled to resist the demands made upon him, without a resort to violence. At the visit of the Political Agent for South Eastern Baluchistan, the Rinds were required to desist from their violent^claims for the surrender of their slaves, who, as a matter of expediency, and in order to remove all cause of irritation, have been, as far as possible, conveyed to India. 10.—SLAVE TRADE. There were no captures of slave dhows by Her Majesty's Ships during the year under report. There were a few cases in which slaves appealed to the Residency for freedom. Where it was found that importation into Persia had been recent, manumission was granted, and if the freed slaves desired it, and it was possible, they were conveyed to their former homes. 11.—ROYAL NAVY VESSELS.

WILSON, Colonel, Political Resident, Persian Oulf. /P art IL—ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY AND CONSULATE FOR THE YEAR 1893-94, There is but little change to record in the Political history of Oman since Political. iast y ear ' s report was written; no events of political importance occurred during the year under review, and the collisions between the tribes were local and did not affect the general peace of the country. • The policy of the Sultan towards the tribes is not marked by that ener&lt;?v and firmness w^hich they would wish to see their ruler exercise towards the settlement of the feuds and quarrels which so frequently break out between them. Interference in their internal affairs they are very ready to resent, but they have been accustomed to look to the central authority for a decision in the matter of their differences with their neighbours, and in this respect the action of the Sultan is often neither timely nor sufficiently assertive. On the other hand, the Sultan's hold over the tribes is but slight, and aggressive 01 coercive measures might lead to inconvenient reprisals. Oman has enjoyed a period of tranquillity for the last five years which is perhaps without a parallel in the annals of its history, and to this Sayyid Fey sal's mild and little-felt rule has, in a measure, contributed. But other causes have been at work those who have it in their power to cause mischief are either absent or disinclined to move; no new leader has risen, round whom political intrigues could focus, and the Shaikhs remember that in their attempts against Muscat in the reign of Sayyid Toorkee, the Sultan received assistance from the British Government. Inter-tribal raids and feuds between the rival Hinawi and Ghafri factions were rife as usual, but they did not lead to any general rising or coalition of the tribes. Early in April a party of 80 of the Beni Hina under the leadership of Badr, a son of the Tameemah, Hilal-bin-Zahir, raided on the Yal Khamis, who reside at Hail under the protection of the Beni Umar and Beni Kelban; they killed seven of the Yal Khamis and made off with a quantity of camels and goats and some household property, losing four of their number in the encounter. On their return they were pursued by 700 of the Beni Umr and Beni Kelban; 20 of the Beni Hina were killed in the affray that ensued on their refusal to give up the plundered property, and the rest, with the exception of their leader, who managed to make good his escape, were made prisoners. At the request of the Tameemah, Hilal-bin-Zahir, Sayyid Ibrahim-bin-Kais sent his nephew, Sayyid Saood-bin-Azzan, to open negotiations for the redemption of the captives. Later on in the month the Beni Hina were attacked at Ghafat by the Bani Shekeyl, who set fire to the place. Amongst other casualties, Ghusn, the eldest son of the Tameemah of the Beni Hina, with two of his companions, was killed, and Muhammad-bin-Ali, one of the principal Shaikhs of the Beni Shekeyl, was carried wounded off the field. This quarrel owed its origin to the Beni Hina persisting in erecting a fort on a plot of land they had bought from the Beni Shekeyl. Hostilities again broke out between the tribes later on in the year ; in September Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali induced them to come to peace, after the Beni Hina had been credited with the murder of a former Kadhi of Muscat and his wife in retaliation for the death of the son of their Tameemah, the Kadhi having taken an active part in supporting the Beni Shekeyl against the Beni Hina. Shaikh Hilal-bin-Zahir subsequently c 220 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL showing signs of desire to break the peace, a caution from Shaikh Saleh-bin- Ali produced the required result. Hostilities between the Yal Saad of the Batineh and the Ahl Dhahireh were renewed early in the year. On this occasion the Yal Saad were the first to assume the offensive. They attacked Mubrah with a force said to consist of 4,000 men; further reinforcements were expected, but they did not wait for their arrival. The attack was repulsed, the Yal Saad losing 117 in killed and wounded, the defenders, 7 Shaikhs and 42 men. An attempt at mediation made by the Sultan produced no result. After several minor raids on both sides, the Yal Saad prepared in November for a fresh advance on Mubrah. Sayyid Ibra him-bin-Kais then interfered and at once brought about a cessation of hos tilities. A month later the leadiug Shaikhs on both sides met before Sayyid Ibrahim-bin-Kais and settled the terms of peace. An old feud between the Beni Mukeem and the Sulooh of Tewee was renewed in May, the Beni Mukeem being the aggressors. They made an expedition against Tewee and set fire to a large house in which powder was stored; 14 of the Sulooh were killed by the explosion and the fire of the attack, which lost three men. An ineffectual attempt was made by the Sultan's younger brother, Sayyid Fabad, to bring about a reconciliation. Subsequently, Shaikh Saleh put a stop to farther hostilities. In June collisions occurred between the Beni Umar and the Hawasineh of Khaboorah, in consequence of the murder by the Beni Umar of the Shaikh of the Beni Saeed, a tribe being under the protection of Hawasineh. In the same month the Sultan sent a force under Sayyid Badr-bin-Seif to take possession of Mansoor and oust the garrison of the Beni Harras from the fort: the expedition was ill-planned; and a war-cry being raised, the Sultan's party had to beat a- precipitate retreat. His Highness had taken up his quarters at the time in the fort of Nakhl awaiting the arrival of Shaikhs Suleiman-bin-Seif of the Beni Jabir and Khalfan-bin-Humayyan of Nakhl, whom he had summoned to his presence; but hearing that these two Shaikhs were preparing to obey his summons with a force of between 400 and 500 men, he left Nakhl suddenly and returned to Birkah. The Beni Jabir then proceeded to cut down some date trees belonging to two of His Highness's officials in the vicinity of Nakhl. In September Hameyd-bin-Salim, commonly known as Kurta, a well- known marauder, commenced raiding in the Sharkey eh ; in consequence of rumours that he intended proceeding against Kurryat, the Sultan increased his garrison in that town. Apparently Kurta found enough to occupy his atten tion in the Sharkeyeh for some time, for it was not till the end of February that he began to move towards Kurryat. His Highness sent orders to the tribes holding the passes leading to the coast to block his way, and at the same time sent a further reinforcement to Kurryat. Finding his advance checked at the passes, Kurta opened negotiations with the tribes to let him through; failing in this, he returned to his country and sent a humble letter to His High ness, begging for forgiveness. The Beni-Bu-Ali carried on a desultory war with their hereditary foes, the Beni-Bu-Hasan, for some months : no general engagement took place, and the casualties on both sides were few. A truce was effected between them by Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali. Collision also occurred between the Yal Wahibah and the Jenebah. In February 1894 peace was made between the Harth and the Ahl Bashar through the instrumentality of Shaikh Rashid-bin-Uzaiz, the Sultanas TVali in W adi Semmayil, This official was deputed, at the same time, to settle theRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE TEAR 1893-94 21 differences between the Ghafri tribes of tlie Semmayil Valley and the A hi Boshar: but when the Ghafri Shaikhs came to Muscat to receive the indemnity ' * which had been agreed upon, the Sultan declined to pay the full amount. The Shaikhs refused to accept a reduction, and left Muscat feeling much aggrieved. This refusal of the Sultan to abide by the terms of the decision which it was understood he had authorised his Wali to make, led to further trouble and loss of life after the close of the year under report. A peace was concluded between the Harth and the Beni Jabir. In October His Highness the Sultan was informed that His Highness Sayyid Abdul Aziz had definitely refused to accept a pension from the Sultan on the condition that he should quietly reside in India. The attitude assumed by the Rinds of Mekran in the matter of their claims for the restitution of their slaves who had taken refuge at Gwadur, was a standing menace to that out-lying portion of the Sultan's dominions for some months during the year. Several hundreds of these fugitive slaves had col lected in Gwadur, the first arrivals coming in early in the preceding cold weather. In May intimation was received of a threatened attitude on that town in consequence of the refusal of the Wali to return the slaves to their former masters, which the Sultan w r as bound not to do by the terms of the Treaty of 1873. This threat was repeated at intervals, but was not carried into execution. The garrison at Gwadur was reinforced, and correspondence took place between the Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, and the Government of India. It was evi dent that the Sultan was not expected to provide a permanent refuge for these fugitive slaves in Gw T adur, and that they could not be allowed to take up their residence there in such close proximity to their former masters. They were accordingly advised to leave for Karachi and other British Indian ports, which they did, some of them receiving assistance to enable them to reach their port of destination. One case of breach of the maritime peace of the Gulf occurred, in which the Sultan was advised to inflict a fine of Es. 50 on Mehdi-bin-Ali, the Shaikh of the Kamazarah tribe of Khassab, for proceeding with a party of armed men by sea to Shaam with the object of prosecuting a certain claim his wife had against the estate of her deceased father. After some months' delay, the attendance of the Shaikh was enforced at Muscat and the fine was recovered. The Telegraph station at Gwadur was closed in September, the Post Office was maintained, and a telephonic circuit Genera1 ' was established connecting Gwadur with the telegraph line at Ormara and Charbar for the use of the Native Assistant. A fire broke out in Gwadur in April, which caused considerable damage to house and other property. The loss suffered by British subjects was esti mated at Rs. 3,000. Nothing further has been heard of the seven Africans to whose case allusion was made in last year's report. The Slave trade. reputed owners of the party, who have property both in Melindi on the East Coast of Africa and in Oman, were sent for when they arrived in Oman, and were interrogated; they stated that the Africans were not their slaves and denied all knowledge of them. It is understood that further enquiries are in progress by the officials of the Imperial East Africa Company to test the truth of the above statements. A bold case of kidnapping occurred in February 1894i, by which one Muftab, an African freeman, who had taken passage in a buglah at Lingah on his way from Busrah to Zanzibar, was landed by the nakhoda of the22 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GL'LF, ETC., 1893-94 bimlah on the Batineh coast and sold into slavery. Information of the fact was 'iven by the friends of the African on their arrival at Muscat; on a representation being made to the Sultan by this Agency, steps were taken which resulted in the release of the kidnapped man and his restoration to his friends. It is satisfactory to add that the craft was confiscated, and that he is at present undergoing a term of imprisonment in one of the Muscat forts. Twenty-six fugitive slaves were granted freedom during the year under the terms of the Treaty of 1873. H. M.'s Ships Sphinx, Cossack, Brisk, and Lapwing, and H. M.'s E. I. M. S. Lawrence touched at Mim. Xavy ' cat. In March 1894 His Excellency Rear-Admiral Kennedy visited Muscat in the R. I. M. S. Lawrence, and exchanged visits with His Highness the Sultan. In April 1893 the S. S. Khiva, carrying a large number of pilgri ms M „ ine . to Jeddah, was destroyed by fire off Merbat on the south coast of Arabia A full report on the matter was submitted to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the 10th of the following May. The assistance rendered by the Sultan in provisioning and despatching His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar's steam-ship Avoca, which was then the only steamer in harbour, to the relief of the distressed pilgrims and crew, and the subse quent steps taken by His Highness for their comfort and accommodation whilst in his territories, were acknowledged by the Government of India by the presentation to His Highness of a handsome telescope and watch. Presents were also sanctioned for the leading Shaikhs and tribesmen of the friendly Arabs who gave shelter and protection to the pilgrims and crew of the Khiva on their first landing; to their friendly exertions over a thousand persons, barely escaping the most terrible of the perils of the sea, owed the safety of their lives and property.

M:s Political Agent and Consul, Muscat.Paet III—REPORT ON THE TRADE AND COMMERCE OE THE CON SULAR DISTRICT OF BUSHIRE FOR THE YEAR 1893. General remarhs.—V&amp;Q general depression from which trade in Southern Persia suffered so severely during 1892, proved destined unfortunately, despite confident anticipations to the contrary, to be prolonged and even intensified during the past year. Yet it cannot he said that the year 1893 opened under unfavourable auspices : the wheat harvest of the Persian Gulf littoral was most abundant, and the activity which was observed in certain important branches of commerce towards the end of 1892 gave reason for hope that a general revival of trade was about to be inaugurated. Before many months had elapsed, however, it became evident that this hope was not destined to be realised. Exchange, which, it was hoped, had in 1892 reached its lowest limit, pursued its downward course throughout the year, and with its close the Kran had decreased in value by 15 per cent. Early in the year, more over, reports were received of the appearance in the districts about Shiraz of swarms of locusts, which had begun to create havoc among the croj)s; and in June there was added to these misfortunes an outbreak of cholera with its attendant dislocation of all commercial transactions. Under these adverse conditions, it is not a matter for surprise that trade should have suffered severely. The cotton crop, which at the commencement of the year gave promise of an excellent yield, was in part destroyed by the locusts. Nor were their ravages confined to cotton only, but were extended impartially to cultivation in general. Opium, as is well known, has now be come one of Persia's most important exports; and the great injury inflicted on the crop of 1893, by the same agency as that which so adversely affected the cotton yield, was a severe blow to Persian commerce. The wheat crops of the Persian Gulf littoral were so fortunate as to escape the general de struction • but in the grain-growing districts of Ears, the harvests gave lamen table results. The price of grain at once rose, and the difficulties of the situation were aggravated, it is said, by operations aimed at the realisation of a profit by buying up and storing grain in anticipation of a further rise of price. ^ How far these operations were attended with success is not known but prices undoubtedly rose and the evils of widespread scarcity ensued. In May the threatening attitude of the people, more especially in Shiraz where it was feared they would be driven to acts of violence by their un fortunate condition, led to the imposition of an embargo on the exportation of w^heat from Bushire—a measure the advantage or efficacy of which is open to great doubt. Operations in tobacco, moreover, which was formerly exported in considerable quantities to Turkey, have, during 1893, been greatly restricted owing to the monopoly enjoyed by the Turkish Regie or Societe du Tombac, to which now belongs the exclusive right of importino' foreign tobacco into Turkey. Persian tobacco can therefore be only imj)orted in to Turkey through the agents of the Societe, and this trade, which at one time was exceedingly lucrative, has greatly declined. An effort has been made to counteract this loss by a combination under strong religious sup- port, for the purpose of restricting and controlling the production; the prospects of success in this attempt can hardly yet be gauged. It might naturally be supposed that the decline in the value of the Kran, and the distress prevailing in parts of Southern Persia could not fail to have a serious effect on the import trade. Such has not been the case, however, to the extent that might reasonably have been anticipated, and while the import trade of 1893 cannot be described as entirely satisfactory, theADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL imports under certain heads shew a marked increase in volume when compared with those of 1892. _ . One of the chief difficulties with which trade has to contend m Southern Persia, and indeed throughout the country, is the unsatisfactory state of the routes, for it would be impossible to call them roads. There can be no doubt of the vast gain which, in the interests of the development of trade generally, and the consequent diffussionof prosperity throughout the country, would result from an improvement of the means of communication ; but the responsibility in this connection is one which, in practice certainly, if not in theory, appears to be entirely ignored, and such efforts as have been made to lemedy the evil, have been due to the enterprise of European Companies. An instance of this is to be found in the Road Company which has laid down a carriage road be- tween Tehran and Koom, and placed a service of vehicles upon it. The scheme contemplated an extension to Ispahan and Shuster, but without more encourage ment, and better prospects for the security of the profits in the undertaking than the present condition of things affords, the extension seems doubtful. An important event of the year was the withdrawal from Persia of the Agencies of the Ottoman Bank, and banking operations in this country are now practically a monopoly in the hands of the Imperial Bank of Persia. It would be vain to deny that the commercial outlook generally is at present far from encouraging. The decline in the value of silver, which appears still unarrested in curtailing the purchasing power of the country, must injuriously affect the import trade, and the result is perhaps aggravated ; certainly an evil is added to it by the encouragement on the part of certain of the priesthood of a belief among the people that the inevitable rise in prices is due only to an arbitrary enhancement imposed by British traders. IMPORTS. Indigo. Trade in this article continues to increase. Consequent on the rebellion of the Baharloo tribes in 1892, the trade routes between Bunder Abbas, Yezd, and Kerman were regarded as unsafe during the greater part of 1893, and a considerable portion of the indigo ordinarily imported through Bunder Abbas was diverted from its usual channel and sent through Bushire. Glass and China-ware. —Trade in these wares was dull. Arms and Notwithstanding the prohibition against the im portation of arms, which still remains in force, considerable quantities were, it is stated, imported during the year into Bushire, whence they were de- spatched to Persian Arabistan, where a good market is found, or re-shipped with the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf as their destination. Gold lace and gold thread. —There was little demand for this article, and only a small quantity was imported. Cotton #oods.—The year opened auspiciously in this branch of trade, and for some months there was a strong demand for cotton goods, fair prices being realised. As the year advanced, however, the gradual but persistent fall in the exchange value of the Kran began to make itself felt, and adversely affected the market. The appearance of cholera, the destruction by locusts of the crops in many of the grain-growing districts, and the widespread distress that ensued, caused a still further depression of trade. These adverse conditions produced the most disastrous effects in this branch of trade, and the imports for 1893 show a decrease in value of no less than £90,000 on those of the previous year. Candles. —Candles have been imported in large quantities during the year, and good prices have been realised.residency and muscat political agency for the year 1893-94. 25 Sugar. —Marseilles sugar was imported ia large quantities during the year, although it was reported that there was a brisk trade in Russian sugar from the north. The heavy cost of transport between the Gulf ports and the north of Persia constitutes the chief bar to a really successful development of the trade in Marseilles sugar, and it seems probable that the present revival in the Russian sugar trade is but the first step towards a resumption by the latter of its old ascendancy in the northern markets. The imports of Mauritius sugar show a considerable increase on those of the previous year. Tea. —It is gratifying to be able to record that, notwithstanding the difficulties with which trade in general has had to contend during 1893, the imports of tea show a marked increase on those of previous years. The tea which is import ed into Persia from the south comes almost exclusively from India and Java, and there can be no doubt that it finds favour in the Persian markets. Judging by the figures of the last few years, it would certainly seem as if this trade was capable of considerable expansion. Metals. —There has been a marked revival of activity in the trade in copper, and imports have been largely in excess of those for 1892. On the other hand, there has been a great decrease in the demand for iron. Woollen goods. —Trade in woollen goods appears to have been exceedingly brisk during 1893, and imports were heavy. Lamps and lamp-ware. —There has been an increased demand for lamps and lampwnre during the year. Exports. Cereals. —There was an abundant grain harvest in the Bushire districts in 1893, and no inconsiderable portion of the yield, which was largely in excess of local requirements, was, notwithstanding the high cost of transport, attracted to the interior, where, in many localities, owing to the destruction of the crops by locusts, the price of grain was very high. In consequence of the general distress prevailing in Shiraz and the surrounding districts, owing to the high price of grain, an embargo on the exportation of wheat was imposed by the Go vernment in May, and was still in force at the close of the year. The export of cereals previous to the adoption of this measure had been, however, insigni ficant owing to the unremunerative rates ruling in the European markets, which, moreover, remained unfavourable for transactions in wheat throughout the year. Tobacco—The chief market for Persian tobacco is to be found in Turkey, but exports to that country during 1893 were much restricted owing to the mono poly enjoyed by the Turkish Company 'Ea Societe du lombac , which had, in 1891, succeeded in obtaining a concession from the Porte of the exclusive right of importing foreign tobacco into Turkey for a period of 25 years dating fiom April 1892. Persian tobacco can therefore only be imported into Turkey through its agents, and many Persian merchants, who were formerly in the habit of exporting largely to Turkey, have been obliged to suspend operations entirely. Opium. —The partial destruction of the opium crops by locusts was a heavy blow to Persian commerce. The yield for the year was very poor, and the value of the total export shows a decrease of £132,000 when compared with the ex port of 1892. Almond European crops were again large, and exports from Persia to Europe were accordingly inconsiderable. Heavy shipments were, it is stated, made to Bombay by Native merchants with satisfactory results. Shells. Owing to the heavy exports of the inferior description of shells during recent years, the English markets have been overstocked, and prices ruledadministration report on the persian gulf political very low. A fresh outlet lias, however, been found for this branch of trade. Since the introduction of the Mackinley Tariff, an important industiy in button- making has sprung up in the United States, and large quantities of Peisian shells have found their way there. The yield of 1893 was excellent, but the high prices ruling locally left but a small margin of profit to the exporter. Wool. —The wool export of 1893 was not large, and was of inferior quality. Carpets. —There has been a striking development of the carpet industry during the year, and exports have been extensive. Shipments were made chiefly to Europe and Egypt, where good prices were invariably obtained. Cotton, —The swarms of locusts that appeared and ravaged the cotton-fields soon dispelled any hopes that might have been indulged in, early in the year, of a really plentiful crop. The yield was, however, larger than might have been expected under the circumstances, and exports were heavier than in 1S92, It is reported that Ispahan cotton has commenced to find a good market in Russia, and the cotton trade with Russia, it is believed, might be made to assume con siderable proportions. Miscellaneous. Exchange. —There was a steady rise in the rate or exchange throughout the year, the value of the £ sterling varying from E.rans 40 at the commencement of the year to Krans 47 at its close. Freights, —During 1893, freights ruled very low; they varied from 17/6 to 25/ per ton. The unfavourable prices ruling in the European grain-markets at the com mencement of the year, and the subsequent embargo on the export of wheat from Persia, caused a sensible diminution in the demand for tonnage, and the number of steamers entering the port of Bushire during the year shows a de crease of 11 when compared with the figures for 1892. 'Petroleum. —The winding up of the business of the Imperial Bank Mining Rights Corporation was announced early in the year, resulting from the want of success attending their boring operations at Daliki and on the island of Kishm. Mule hire. —The rate at the commencement of the year was 80 Krans per 100 Tabriz maunds from Bushire to Shiraz. In March it fell to 37^ Krans for the same distance, and with some fluctuations rose to 56 Krans, at which figure it stood at the close of the year. ERED. A.

The total trade for the year is returned at $3,775,326 as against $3,387,435 for the preceding year, showing an increase, including import and export of specie, of $387,891, or excluding specie, of $77,891. I must again point out that the statistics as furnished by the Customs farmer, especially those relating to exports, are approximate only and must not be taken for more than tbey are worth. Excluding specie, of which there is an increase of $120,000, the import trade from India shows a total falling-ofi of nearly $60,000 as compared with the preceding year; this decline is most marked in Bengal rice, cotton, and other stuffs, and sweet and cocoanut oil; an increase appears in Turkey red and twist, and a slight increase in joioari and kerosine oil. Out of 88 items of import from British India, 54 show a decrease, the net decrease being nearly $60,000 as noted above. This is attributed to the decline in the value of the dollar in exchange with the rupee, which followed the closing of the Indian mints. The effects are only beginning to be felt. The greater the difference between the rupee and bar silver, the more will the import trade of Oman with British India be liable to decline or to be deflected to other channels. As it is there is a marked decrease in the import of Bengal rice of $64,610 and an in crease in the import of wheat from Persia of $27,000, which point ominously to the direction which the trade in food-cereals may be expected to take. The imports excluding specie from the Persian Gulf and Mekran have fallen off by $42,500, notwithstanding the increase of $27,000 in Persian wheat. Muscat would seem to have left off dealing with the Persian Gulf for mother-of-pearl, as the import in this article has fallen from $50,000 to nil. The imports from South Arabia and Africa show an increase of $22,000 in mother-of-pearl, and $30,000 in pearls, whilst there is a decrease of $12,000 in cotton goods. Imports from the United States, Mauritius and Singapore show a slight in crease under the heading box shocks and sugar. Excluding an increase of $200,000 in specie, the export trade has in creased by $152,000, the principal items being dry dates, fish, large and small, cotton fabrics, fruit, and salt. The unusually heavy imports and exports of specie, which figure in this year's returns, were due to exchange transactions in Bombay, where dollars at one time were procurable at cheaper rates than in Oman. Consequently, the country was drained of rupees for the purchase of dollars; and when the rupees were exhausted, an unprecedented run was made on British copper coinage for remittance to Bombay. This caused much inconvenience and considerable hard ship in the country by appreciating the copper coinage with reference to the dollar, which fell in value at one time from 140 pice to 108 pice. The customs were farmed to Seth Rattansi Purshotam for $115,000. J. HAYES SADLER, Major, H. B.

Wheat. —The export of wheat being prohibited until the end of August, a large portion of the crop was conveyed to Busrah in lighters for sale. Wheat is still coming down for shipment. Dates. —With the exception of dates all cargo shipped by British boats. Dates are shipped by native coasting boats for Persian Gulf, Oman, and Red Sea ports, of which no returns are available. Imports. General decrease in imports due to epidemic. Increase in rice owing to failure of rice crop in Khuzistan. All imports by British vessels, except some of kerosine oil by native vessels, and about ten bales Manchester chintz and about thirty-five bales Syrian cotton goods.

Only returns of British shipping obtainable; many coasting craft from Oman and Red Sea call during date season. Karun trade. The Governor of Mohammerah's steamers ceased running with cargo at end of April, and the carrying trade on Lower Karun is at present carried by British vessels. The Tigris-Euphrates Steam Navigation Company have built a steamer, specially for the Karun, which has been running regulaidy twice a month since Eebruary. Through-shipment from Bombay to Shushtar is now taken advantage of by shippers, and the amount of cargo thus shipped is increasing. A small amount of cargo for Dizful is now sent vid Karun and Shushtar, but the major part still goes by caravan. ^ ; IHI 4* 1 ■10 m m P56 administration report on the persian gulf political X)i Zt —The Naseri (Persian) Company attempted to utilize the Diz river, their steamer running to within about 16 miles of Dizful on several occasions. Special advantages as to customs-dues were offered ; but owing to proper arrangements for passes not having been made, the cargo brought to Mohammerah was delayed and no more was sent. Agriculture. Wheat. —The wheat crop was fair, but slightly below the average, owing to lateness of the rains. Prospects for next harvest are good, there having been exceptionally heavy rains, and there has been a large increase o^er pre vious years in amount sown. Dates. —The date crop was better than in 1892; price per lbl60 was 5 shillings at commencement of season, but dropped to 3 shillings and 6 pence owing to Bombay market becoming overstocked. Population. The population of Mohammerah is now about 3,800. Epidemics. Cholera. —Cholera occurred in Mohammerah from end of May to middle of August, and again from middle of September to end of October; but the number of cases was not large, and only about a hundred and forty deaths occurred.
