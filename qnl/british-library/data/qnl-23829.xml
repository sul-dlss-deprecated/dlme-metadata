Aside from Agency and Residency staff, the file’s other principal correspondent is the Bahrain merchant Abdul Aziz Alqosaibi &amp; Brothers [‘Abd al-‘Azīz al-Quṣaybī], who are charged with looking after the horses while a buyer is found, and regularly send invoices for expenses incurred in keeping the animals.
