These should be asked for. The subscriber should examine the documents and apply the following three tests to judge for himself tha financial stability of the Company : — (1) whether the latest actuarial investigation disclosed a divisible surplus, namely a surplus a portion of which was allocated to policy holders, (2) whether the revenue account shows that the expenses of management, including commission, did not absorb more than a third of the premium income in the last financial year, and (3) whether in the latest balance sheet 'loans on personal security' did not constitute an appreciable portion of the total assets of the Company.

Subjects- Extension of the provisions of the Provident Jftrnds Act, 1925, to the provident funds established ^by public inatittJtions, ....« I am directed to refer to section 8 of the Provident Funds Act of 1925 and to say that applications are received 'by the Government of India from time to time from public institutions for the inclusion of their names in the Schedule tothe Act and for the extension of its provisions to the provident funds established Dy them. Before issuing a direc tion under sub-section 12) of section 8 of the Act, the Government of India insist that the rules of the provident funds established for the benefit of the employees of those institutions should be in substantial conformity with the provisions of the Act* -^n many ca es, however, it has been noticed that the rules forwarded by institutions are v ery much in conflict with the provisions of the Act, with the result that a closer scrutiny is called for involving waste of time and labour, and unnecessary correspondencejfc, some times extending over a number of years, before the necessary declaration under the Provident Funds Act is finally issued. I am to request that, in order to save time and labour, the institutions desirous of applying for the issue of a declaration under section 8(2) of the Provident mnds Act should be asked to model their provident fund Kules, as closely as possible, on the Contributory Provident Fund (India) Bules or the corresponding rules of the Local Go vernment. They may, of course, be allowed to make such variations and adaptations as would suit the requirements of any particular institution, provided that they do not in any respect conflict with the provisions of the Provident funds Act. I am also to request that in such an event a full exolanation, where necessary, of such variations and adaptations should invariably be forwarded.Ho. 1458-H.II/36 Government of Xnala* finance ii©partra6nt« Simla, the 30tfc Juno 1036 The imaQrmentloned papers ar© forwarded to all Departments of ^Ixe Govemment of India except the Defence Department anu the Hallway Bepartiaent (Hallway Board) • By order, etc., 3d • K 0 K 9 Ohettur Assistant Secretary to the Gbvt. of India# • * • • 1- Letter from the Accountant general, central revenues, to the Government of India, finance department, Mo* I) # 8-6-3493 dated the 24th October 1933. 2- Letter from the OorBrmm t of India, Finance Dept., to the Accountant General Central Kevenuest Mo# 37-XXII/S3 dated the 12th DBoemDer 1933.1 Soyy of letter from the Accountant Gamer- 1 # Central levenuea, to the Government of In ia, Finance department, Ho. fiF 3-6-5493 dated th@ 24th October 1933. m* m *mm **** m **** ^ Contriturory Provident Fund Hulas (Infita) Prooadure undor ..ula 26 #. . « • 1 have the honour to Invite a reference to Awie 26(o) of the Oontrit&gt;utory Provident ^una Hules (Infila), which provides that before the amount standing to the credit of a stfbgsc iher is paid out of the Fund, the Governor General in Council may direct the deduction therefrom and payment to Government of any asaount due under a liability Incurred hy the suhscriher to Govern ment, etc. X aas not certain what procedure should toe followed to give effect to this provision, and would inquire whether an Accounts Officer before paying the balance of the fund should report each case of outstanding dues, of which it may have cognisance, to the Government of India for orders before any payment is made* 2.

In such an event, certain/ insurance companies allow an option to the assured to convert the policy into an extended term policy on terms and conditions which are generally laid down at the hack of the policy, ^he features peculiar to such an extended term nolicy are, viz., (i) that the assured is covered for a specified period 'beyond the date from which he ceases to pay premia; (ii) that the company forgoes all future premia on the pollcy; (ill) that the company undertakes to pay the assured the full amount of the policy only in the event of his death within the extended period; (iv) that if the assured survives that period, he is en titled to receive nothing from the Company; in cer tain circumstances, only a very nominal amount.Office of the A.G .G .R, New Delhi, No. DPHM/1531 dated the 3-12-36. -1 Returned with the remarks that the Sanction in question makes 10 mention of the interest payable by the subscriber.

Subjects- Section 5(1) of the Provident Funds Act,1925o o • • • « c o Sir, I am directed to state for your information that the following questions have been raised with.regard to the appli cation of Section 5(1) of the .Provident Funds Act, 1925 to nominations made under rules regulating the various provident Funds s- (1) Whether the provision in rule 26 of the State Railway Provident Fund Rules to the effect that on the marriage or remarriage of a subscriber who is not a Hindu ? Mohemmadan, Budhist or other person exempted from the operation of the Indian Succession Act, any nomination already mad.e by Mm shall forthwith become null end void, is ineffective as contravening Section 5(1) of the Provident Funds Act. (2) Whether a nomination made under one set of rules of a Provident Fund would become invalid under a later* set of rules, if not revised as required by the later set of rules. 2. as it is neoessi-ry that the correct position with regard to nominations made under section 5(1) of the Provident Funds Act should be explained I am directed to say that the position is that Section 5(1) does not itself provide for nominations to be made, and that it does not by itself create- any right in favour of the nominee. It merely gives protection and force to a nomination made in accordance with the rules of a Provident Fund, If, therefore, a rule exists in any Provident From To- Q . - 2 - ' Provident Fund Rules rendering nominations invalid on marriage or remarriage, nominations (even if valid when made) will become ineffective if subscribers marry or remarry and will not be nominations to which the projection of Section 5(1) of the Act could extend. I'here is thus no question of any provision such as that referred to at paragraph 1(1) above being in conflict with the Act. As regards the question in paragraph 1(2) above, a nomination under Section 5(1) of the Act must also not only be in accordance with the rules (as they may .stand when it is made), but it must continue to be in accordance with the rules (as they may stand, amended or altered, from time to time). The words 'duly made in accordance with the rules of the Fund f ' occurring in the section are significant, and in view of these words the position is that a nomination once made in accordance with the rules might lose its validity, if the rules are subsequently altered or amended. A nomination made under one set of rules may thus become invalid under another set of rules if not revised as required by the later set of rules and so loses the benefit of Section 5(1) of the Act.

In the declaration form prescribed, under the new rules no such prevision exists. But such declaration forms in which guardians have been nominated under the old rules remain valid and payments will have to be . paid to such guardians uncfer the new rules in view of sub-rule (8) of rule 8 mentioned above, I would request-to know whether my interpretation is correct,, 2o, On the other hand in the following case the position becomes slightly different,, Under rule 15 of the old General Provident Fund Rules a nomination becomes invalid on the marriage or remarriage of a subscriber even if such nomiation had been made in favour of a member of his family ? while under the new rules the remarriage of a subscriber doesjft nufLlify a previous nomination pra^ xled it has been made in favour of/member of his family, ^ declaration in favourof a moraber qf a subscriber's family made and accepted under ■ '■ V ' ; ' ' .1. CI : . ;■ ■ the old rules would continue to be valid automatically if the subscriber rrcfffiamies after the new rules come into force, In this case the new set of rules legalises a nomination which would have become invalid if the old set of rules had- continued. This presumption also may be confirmed. 3» I may also add incidentally that tiie word 'thereunder' appearing in sub~rule (8) of-Rule (8)'of the General Provident Fund (CentcaPervices) Rules should evidently be replaced by 11 ,hereunder' 5. if my interpretation of Rule 8(2) be correct.Res.

The following are some of the features peculiar to such policies 9 viz.j (1) If the assured dies within the specified period, assurance money becomes payable ? but if he outlives that period no payment is made;' (2) No surrender value is allowed at any time; (3) The policy holder is given the option during the currency of the policy of taking out a fresh policy under any other plan issued by the Company concerned this is restricted to Endowment Assurance policies in certain Companies without being required to pass a medical examination. The premium payable and other conditions attaching to the new policies however are the same as for a fresh entrant at his age at the time of exercising the option, the only tangible benefit obtained being that the Company is bound to issue him a policy irrespective of the state of his health. All these policies therefore partake, in essential ? of the features of the Extended Term Policies referred to in this Department letters No.P.21(i5)-R a 11/36 f dated the 10th July, 1936, and the 27th October 1936 it is undesirable that they should be allowed to be financed from Provident Funds« The Government of India have accordingly decided that such not policies- should/be accepted under the General Provident Fund (Superior Civil Services) and (Central Services) Rules or the Contributory Provident Fund Rules (India).ih 5?

Subject:- Substitution of a new, policy for a policy assigned to the Secretary of State e Sir 5 In continuation of this Department letter No, F.21 (7)-RoII/37 9 dated the 22nd April 1937 9 on the subject stated above 9 I am directed to say that the orders conveyed therein contemplated the surrender of a policy and the substitution of a better policy in another office. It has, however9 been brought to notice that in many cases in which it.is to the advantage of a policy holder to replace his policy by a policy in another,.and better office the policy which is to be replaced may not be entirely surrendered. Insurance companies allow? as an alternative to surrender of the existing policy9 a fully paid-up policy for a reduced a. Sum insured as/ quid £rp quo for premiums paid prior to discontinuance of further premiums. The existing policy thus, remains in force as a paid up policy and constitutes part insurance cover in addition to the sum insured under the new policy v Thus? as a re suit of the replacement transaction 9 the policy holder holds insurance in two offices partly in the. old and partly in the new office. The Government of India have .decided that if the total amount of insurance cover given by the two policies be the same or larger-than the amount of insurance given by the old policy prior to the discontinuance of premiums the reunde r.thereunderj the first of the conditions set out in this Department letter quoted above should be regarded as satisfie d. represented that it would be practically impossible to arrange for the new policy to mature on exactly the same date &lt;as the old policy. The Government of India have, therefore ? decided that this condition should be re placed by the following:- M (3) the new policy should mature within the same year as the old policy;' Copy forwarded to all Departments of the , Government of India (including the Financial Adviser, Military Finance 9 the Reforms Office and the Secretary to the Executive Council of the Governor General); the Political Department; the Crown Finance Officer; the Hi^i Commissioner for India; the Finance Officer?

The amendments have been rrmde to take effect from the 1st april 1937 for the reason that, from that date, the Secrete.ry of State in Council has disappeared as a statutory authority for tne purpose of executing -contracts on behalf of a Government in India and that under section 177 of the Government of India let only an instrument of assignment executed Defore that date can be construed as if the policy were 'assigned to the Governor Gener .l in Council or the Governor of a Province as the case may be. The result is that in the c.se of policies which have already been assigned, on or after the 1st April 1937, to the Secretary of State in Council, the assignment has been ■ - made to a person not in existence and is, therefore, ineffective. The assignment on such policies should, therefore/ f J-2- • therefore, be cancelled over the signature of the assignor or assignors (..s the case may be) s and a fresh assignment made out according to the amended rules and registered with the Company concerned, 2. :1s regards reassignments, if any, executed by vany.

I am directed to state that the general ruling referred to in the first paragraph of this Department letter No.D/6079-R.11/28, dated the 18th January 1929 ( a copy of which was enclosed in this Department endorsement No.D/6079-R* 11/28 of the same date) is not applicable to the case of a Hindu widow with minor children. As their natural guardian she is their legal' guardian, and no order of Court is necessary to entitle her to receive her deceased husband' s provident fund money''on their benalf. The instructions contained in paragraph 2 of the above quoted letter should, therefore, be read as modified to the extent that, where there is no guardian appointed by Court, payments in excess of Es.lOO/- may be made to a Hindu widow on behalf of her minor children. This modification of the instructions \ relates only to the case of a Hindu widow.Copy of letter N o .F^IQ- j OTIII-R.II/33&gt; dated tne • 2nd October 1933 5 from 7/.

The object of this memorandum is to lay down for the assistance of officers called upon to administer the Provident 9 Eund Rules, certain practical principles which may be safely followed in their administration. The memorandum is not exhaustive and exceptional cases may arise which are not covered by these instructions, but it is hoped that it will be found useful in dealing with the generality of cases arising under the various Provident Eund Rules. 2. The memorandum does not cover the Railway Provi dent Eund Rules, and therefore its application to cases arising in connection with the administration of those Rules is limited to such provisions of the Railway Provident Eund Rules as are similar to those on the civil side. 3. It is hoped that the memorandum will be useful also to subscribers and that it will assist them to arrange for the disposition of their policies in a manner which will enable their families to realise provident fund deposits with the minimum of inconvenience and expense.MEMOEANDUM EXPLANATOEY OF GOVEENMENT PEOVIDENT EUND EULES VIS-A-VIS THE LAW ON THE SUBJECT. It may be observed at the outset that the various Provident Fund Eules have been framed under Section 96-B of the Government of India Act, w 1919, and that they have been kept alive under Section 276 of the Govern ment of India Act, 1935, so far as they are consistent with the Act and are to be deemed to be rules made under the appropriate provisions thereof. 2. The rules come into contact with the law as regards— (1) the protection of deposits, (2) the power of disposition of deposits, (3) the repayment of deposits on the death of the subscriber or depositor, and (4) life insurance policies and their assignment and re-assignment. The Provident Fnnd Act itself and the statutorv rules framed under the Government of India Act legislate for (1), (2^ and (3\ and the Indinn Contract Act, the Transfer of Pronertv Act, the Married Women's Pro- pertv Act and the Insnranoe Act, 19^7, govern the a««ioTimpnt ancpre- assisnment of insurance policies. The Insurance Act, 1937, will come into force shortly. 3. Effect of section 3 {T) and ,3 (2)—The -protection of deposits. —The Provident Fund Act protects deposits both during the life time of and after the death of the depositor. Section 3 (1) gives complete protection during the life time of the subscriber against creditors and also against Government save to the extent contemplated in Section 6 in the case of a Contributory Provident Fund. Section 3 (2) deals with the protection of deposits after death and ensures that any sums standing to the credit of any subscriber to any Provident Fund at the time of his death and payable under the rules of the Fund to any dependant shall, subject to any deduc tion authorised by Section 6 (if the Fund is a Contributory Provident Fund), vest absolutelv in the dependant free of anv charge (including even succes sion duty). This protection does not extend to a person who becomes entitled to the Provident Fund money but is not a dependant. The pay ment to the dependants is, however, subject to any assignment or charge made prior to the Act unless the dependant is a child or widow of the subscriber, in which case even an assignment made before the 1st April 1926 will not prevail. ^ 4 Power Of- disposition.—k subscriber after retirement from service * at perfect liberty to withdraw his deposits in a provident fund and deal with them as he pleases. While in service, however, he is entitled to and, as a matter of practice, required to make arrangements to dispose of his deposits by nominating some member or members of his family to receive the money after his death (the word 'family' has heen defined m A. suhseriber who has no family can nominate any one he pleases but sueh a nomination will become yoid when he acquires a family. T nf le a ' position, briefly stated, is that a nomination made m accordance ;lh thet mtmmvov JfnjIBQSvl i'.j VrA i :• :Li £,:\- ' o' ,i i rules of the fund confers on the nominee an absolute right notwithstanding that the personal law of the subscriber might prescribe a different destina tion for the deceased subscriber's estate. The legal effect of a nomination is stated in Section 5 of the Provident Fund Act. That Section requires careful reading. Section 5 (1) by itseit does not provide for any nomination to be made and does not by itseit create any right in favour of the nominee. It merely gives protection and | force to a nomination made in accordance with the rules of the royi en Fund. If, therefore, a rule exists in anv Provident Fund Pules (as m Eule 26 of the State Railway Provident Fund Pules), rendering nomina tions invalid by marriasre or remarriage, nominations, even i va i^ v en made, will become ineffective if a subscriber marries or re-marries and will not be nominations to which the protection of Section 5 (1) of the Act will extend. A nomination made under Section 5 (1) of the Act must be a valid nomination in accordance with the rules in force at the time such nomina tion is made. There is always a risk that such nomination may lose its effect in the light of subsequent amendments or alterations of the rules. Rule 8 (9), of the General Provident Fund (Central Services) Rules only gives protection to nominations made before the rules came into force, in order that there may be no doubt as to the validity of any nomination it is in the interest of subscribers to see that nominations are m accordance with the rules as they may stand amended or altered from time to time. Section 5 (2) merely extends the scope of the Succession Certificate Act of 1889 and Bombay Regulation VIJI of 1827 and enables nominees men- tioned in Section 5 (1) to claim succession certificates under these enact- ments [payment of such claims has also been provided for in Section 4 {o) (1) of the Act]. A subscriber or depositor is permitted in his life time ^ to draw on his deposits or subscriptions for payment of premia on a life insurance PO llc y which is thus financed out of the general provident fund. The subject of life insurance policies is. however, sufficiently important to merit separate treatment in another section. 5 Repayment. —Sections 3 (2) and 4 of the Provident Fund Act regu late repayment of Provident Fund deposits but the latter section should be read in coniunction with the relevant provident fund rules governing the manner of distribution of deposits. Any sum navable under these rules to a member of the family of a deceased subscriber vests m such member under sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Act and is payable to s^h depen dant or, if such person is a minor or a lunatic, to the person authorised by law to receive it on his behalf. The person undoubtedly authorised by law- to receive, on behalf of a minor, the sum payable is a guardian appointed by a court, 6. Under most of the Provident Fund Rules (except the Indian Civil Service and the State Railways Provident Fund Rules) the Provident Fund money must be paid in equal shares to the members of the family if there is no nomination or if the nomination is in favour of a person who is not a member of the family. If there is no family and the subscriber has nominated an outsider, payment is regulated under Section 4 (1) (b), if theZt^-7 C&gt; total amount does not exceed Es. 5.000, and under Section 4 (1) (c) if the sum exceeds Es. 5,000. The following examples illustrate how repayment is made under the General Provident Fund (Central Services) Eules. Example 1. —There is a family and there is a nomination in favour of one member of the family. The money vests in the nominee and payment must be made to the nominee [See Section 3(2) and 4 (1) (a) and the relevant Provident Fund Eules]. Example 2. —There is a family but there is no nomination in favour of any member of the family or the nomination is not valid under the rules. Payment must be made to all the members of the familv in equal shares [see Section 4 (1) (a) and the relevant Provident Pund Eules]. Example 3. —There is no family and there is a nomination in favour of a person who is not a member of the family. Pavment will be made to the nominee if the amounf does not exceed Es. 5,000 [see Section 4 (1) (b) and the relevant Provident Fund Eules] but if the amount exceeds Es. 5,000 payment will be made to such nominee onlv on production of a succession certificate, probate, or letters of administration [see Section 4 (1) (c) (1)]. Example 4.—Where there is no family and no nomination in favour of any person, payment will be made— (a) if the amount does not exceed Es. 5,000 to the person appearing to the Accounts Officer to be entitled to receive it [see Sec- liqn 4 (1) (b)], (h) if the amount exceeds Es. 5,000 to the nerson 'producing letters of administration, probate or succession certificate. An assignment of deposits bv the subscriber ma^e before the 1st April 1926 will be recosrnised to the extent contemplated in Section 8 (2) of the Act even if there is a familv, but this concession gives no relief to the assignee if the subscriber leaves a widow or a child. 7 Life Assurance Policies and their assignment and reassignment. To enable Government servants to make more satisfactory provision for their families, particularly during the early years of their career when their subscription and the total amounts of their deposits cannot be large, Government have agreed to allow subscribers to finance policies from Provident Funds. This decision was largely actuated by the consideration (i) that the maximum amount of the insurance provided under the Posteu i^ne Insurance Scheme itself was not a high figure (Es 20,000) and (u) that Government could not, while permitting policies under their own scheme of life insurance, refuse a right to take out policies The result has been, however, innumerable references with regard to the legal aspects of the assignment and re-assignment of Policies necessitated by the fact that they are financed from the Provident Fund. ■ 8 Necessity for assignment. —A policy of assurance on ^man We means anv instrument by which the payment of money is assured on death fche'jassure^^rson and the assurer under the terms of which Payment o!a certain sum of money is guaranteed on the occurrence of a certain contin gency, namely the death of a subscriber or the maturity of the policy. The assured, if the policy matures during his life time, and the successors of the assured, if the policy matures on his death, have the right of claim ing the proceeds of the policy from the assurance company. These policies, being as a rule actionable claims, are ;capable of being transferred. On a transfer, the transferee becomes entitled to the proceeds of the policy. Government permits the subscriber or depositor to pay assurance premia from the sum standing to his credit in his Provident Fund Account. ( j O v- emment also permits a favourable rate of interest as also certain other concessions for the benefit of the family of the Government servant in question. Money paid out of the Provident Fund to finance policies goes out of the Fund altogether and it is conceived that as regards succession, protection from attachment and like purposes the provisions of the irovi- dent Fund Act do not apply to the policy or the proceeds thereof. With a view to obtaining security for the moneys thus advanced Government insists that these assurance policies should be assigned to them. ^ r0V ®™- ment has also another obiect in view, namely to prevent the subscriber from trafficking in the policy, and to secure the proceeds of the po icy as far as allowed by the law, for the purposes for which the Provident Fund is designed. It has been urged that a formal assimment is unnecessary and leads to legal difficulties and that the same obiect could probably be achieved if the policy were merely kept in deposit by the Accounts Officer. The legal position is that a mere deposit creates no legal riRht and that a title to a policy can only pass by means of a formal assignment as required by Section 130 of the Transfer of Property Act. It has also been argued that assignment is unnecessary^ because Govern ment does not foreclose on the policy at anv time. This does to be a correct statement of the position. Normally, it is true ' does not realise the proceeds of the policy—to do so before ^ be detrimental to the subscriber's interest except where the policv matures before the retirement of a subscriber and where the amount ^ accrued bonuses is less than the whole of the amount withheld or withdrawn with interest. But in such cases it is clear that the policy monev cannot be claimed in the absence of an assignment as^ the insurance company would refuse to pay, and to cover fhese cases assignment is essential. A further criticism that has been levelled is that^ assignments do not secure Government against a covert, assignment, whieh, it is suggested, can be effected bv means of a separate document. There is no force m this criticism because the notice of assignment given to the insurance com pany concerned in every case would take precedence over any other subse quent notice that may be received. It follows that if policies financed from the Provident Fund are not assigned difficulties will arise and the purpose for which Provident -bunds were instituted may be defeated. 9. Married Women's Proverty Act Policies.—The Provident Fund Rules therefore, rightlv require the assignment of all policies excepting only a type of policy 'expressed on the face of it to be for the benefit of the wife of the subscriber or of his wife and children or any of them'. This type of policy is the very type defined in Section 6 (1) of the Married^ E. i Women's Property Act, 1874, which applied originally to all persons othet than those proiessmg the liindu, Mohammedan, liuddiiist, oikh or dam religions, and was extended to Hindus, Mohammedans, bikhs and Jains witn ehect irom the ist December 1918 in Madras and from the 1st April 192b in other parts of British India. It is, therefore, correct to say tnat all policies except those covered by the Married Women's .froperiy Act ^ should be assigned to Government. Ihe reason for making this exception is not far to seek. A policy covered by tne Married Women s l-'roperiy Act 'sliaii mure and be deemed to be a trust for tne benent oi his wne and cmidren or any oi tnem accord ing to tfie interest so expressed and siaall not, as long a,s any ouject oi tne trust remains, be subject to tne control of the nusUand or to nis cieditors or form part of Jus estate '. Ihe policy is at no time tne property of tne subscriber and he can not assign it. It is true that n his wne and cnnuren join, the subscriber can assign tbe policy to Uovernment. Uut as in most cases, tne cfnidren are minors such an assignment is practically imj^ossi^le. An assignment ot a policy covered by tne Married Vv omen s 1'roperty Act being, lor all practical purposes, impossible, bovernment lias to be sausned witn some tiling less tnan an assignment. The rules, tnereiore, reyuue that such policies should be delivered to the Accounts umcer. Deposit of the policy is less satisfactory than assignment. It creates no legal right m lavour oi tne uovernment and tne suUscnuer, his wilt; and ms cmiuren if of lull age can, actmg togeoner, transfer tne poacy to a stranger, immediately sucli a transaction is aisoovered rule of the (aeneral Provident Jtund ^Central bervices) ixuies, or the correspondaig rule in regard to otner tunds, can De emorced. it is cjuite cunoeivauie that a wne, m whose favour tliere is a statutory limit under this Act, may, when the policy matures, insist upon retaining tne proceeds of tfie pokey and refuse to pay it to tlie 1 und. In that case Government, it is appre hended, will be without a remedy. High Courts differ on the question what is a policy 'which on the face oi it is for tlie beneht of tlie subscnDer s wife or of ins whe and children or any of them'. 'Ihe ordinary endowment policy on the Ine ot a subscriber is payable on the subscriber s death or at the age ol o5 and is made payable to the subscriber's wife provided she survives the assured; faihng her, to the assured, his executors, administrators or assigns. One JbLign Court Has held that this is not a policy for the beneht oi the wife, that the wife is merely a contingent beneficiary and that the policy does' not fall within ISection 6 of the Married Women's Property Act. Another High Court, giving a more extended meaning to a 'policy on the ^ face of it payable to a wife etc.' has taken the contrary view. In practice 9 it is safer to accept the restricted meaning and msist upon assignment ot all policies, in which the wife and the children take a contingent interest After all if the Privy Council were to hold that policies of the contingent beneticiary type are covered by tbe Married Women's Property Act and tbat tbe words should be given an extended meanmg, an ass.gmnent wonld merely turn out to be ineffective. The safest principle in dealing with this class oi.cases is: when in doubt take an assignment. It can do no harm..I ■ i mm 5 10. Accevtability of policies.-Though no legal point arises in connec: tion with the acceptability of policies it might be of advantage briefly to mention the conditions which have to be satisfied before a policy is a owe to be financed from a Provident Fund: (i) the policy shall be one effected by the subscriber himself on his own life or on the joint lives of the subscriber and the subscribers wife or husband (there are women subscribers). ^ (ii) The policy must be capable of being legally assigned by the subs-W criber to Government. The only exception are Married Women s Property 4 Act policies, which have been dealt with in the previous paragraph. With- out an assignment, that is a legal transfer of the claim Government has no legal right to the policy as a security against the advance made from ^ the Provident Fund. (iii) The policy must be free from any prior charge or encumbrance, though an exception is, however, made in the case of a policy which has already been assigned to the wife. But in such an event, it is necessary, either that the wile should be divested of her right in the policy by a formal re-assignment to the husband, or that both husband and wife should join in the assignment. A special form of assignment has been devised tor this purpose. In all cases, therefore, the prior assignee must be divested of his rights before the policy can be accepted. The real point is that when a request is made for a policy to be financed from the Fund the interest in the policy which has been taken out must, if it is to be financed from the Fund, belong wholly to the subscriber. An exception is a policy to which the Married Women's Property Act applies. Policies financed from the Indian Civil Service Provident Fund are neither assigned to the Secretary of State nor deposited with the Accounts Officer. (ivy The policy must not be for the benefit of any person other than the subscriber, or his wife, or the husband of the subscriber, or the wiie or husband and children of the subscriber, or any of them. The Provident Fund has been created in order that provision may be made for the support of the family in the event of the untoward death of the subscriber. The object of the fund would be defeated if the policy were so framed as to pass the benefit to an entire stranger. (v) The policy should not be an educational endowment policy which falls due for payment in whole or in part before the subscriber's normal ( age of superannuation. It is the duty of a subscriber to provide for the education of his children before he reaches the age of superannuation. 11. Assignments of policies.—It has already been stated that all policies except those to which the Married Women's Property Act applies must be assigned. Such policies fall into the following classes:—- 1 Policies in respect of which no prior assignment exists; ' 2. Policies in respect of which there is a prior assignment in favour either of a stranger or the wife; 3. Policies under which a subscriber and his wife or husband are jointly assured; 4. Policies not falling within the Married Women's Property Act., but in which the wife has a clear interest (as in a case where7 on the death of the subscriber the sum assured is payable to the wife and on maturity to the subscriber and his wife jointly). For convenience, reference has been made to the G. P. F. (C. S.) Eules only. (1) As regards the first class of policies an assignment in Form I to ^5 the Third Schedule would offer no difficulties. (2) Where there is a prior assignment in favour of a stranger, however, the interest in the policy has passed to the stranger and it will be necessary, if legal title is to be passed to Government, for the stranger to divest himself of his right by a formal re-assignment of his interests to the subs criber. The subscriber must then execute a fresh assignment to Govern ment in Form I. In cases where the policy was assigned to the wife it was the practice to%treat her, as a joint assured and to make her join 1 . 11 the assignment' to &gt; Government. The law officers disapproved of this procedure. They pointed out that the assured had already transferred his interest in the policy to his wife, and that it was doubtful, in the event of the death of the wife before maturity, whether the assured could claim pavment to the exclusion of the heirs -of the wife. They suggested either that the wife should re-assign the policy to the subscriber and the subscriber should then assign the policy to Government or that by a single assign ment the wife should divest herself of her rights and agree to the subscriber assigning the policy to Government. In the interests of srmphmty and convenience the latter course was adopted and Form 3 to t e Schedule is the result. This step, however, ha f/J use ^. d ®f e ® ° hardship to the widows of subscribers—a point which is discussed at some length in the section on re -assignment. (3) Where a husband and wife are jointly assured and the interest on the policy passes to the survivor, it is clearly necessary that both parties should join in the assignment to Government and Form 2 has been provided for this purpose. (4) In this class of cases also, it will 'be necessary for the husband and wife to join in the assignment to Government in Form 2. 12. Notice. —All Accounts Officers should bear in mind that notice gf an assignment should always be given to the Insurance Company imme diately after execution.. This notice is very important, since under Section 38 of the Insurance Act of 1937 priorities will rank in order of notice, whereas at present priority is decided according to the date on which an assignment is executed. The Accounts Officers should either see that Notice of Assignment is promptly given by the subscriber or send the notice signed by the subscriber with a covering letter to the* company and 0* see that the letter is, acknowledged. It will be possible for the Accounts ^ Officer to satisfy himself at the same time by an enquiry from the com pany that no previous assignment has been registered. 13 Re-assignments. —The various Provident Fund Rules require that a policv which has been assigned to Government should be re-assigned to the Subscriber, beneficiary or to such person 'as may be legally entitled to receive it'. No difficulty arises in a case in which a subscriber and his wife are jointly assured or where they have a joint interest m the policy, and the husband and wife are joint assignors as the survivor in such cases8 as the surviving co-assignor, is legally entitled to have the policy re assigned to him or her. In all other cases, however, where the subscriber dies in service the problem arises as to who is legally entitled to re-assign ment. Though it is open to Government under the rules to re-assign the policy to whatsoever person it considers legally entitled to receive it, with out probate or letters of administration or succession certificate, they follow this procedure entirely at their own risk as there is always the possibility that persons may later come forward as persons rightfully entitled to the proceeds of the policy and seek to fasten liability on Government for re assigning it to a wrongful claimant. To be on the safe side, therefore, it is essential that Government should satisfy themselves in all cases that the person to whom they re-assign the policy is the person who is legally entitled to receive it and this can be achieved only on production of letters of administration, probate or succession certificate. This requirement, however, has given rise to some degree of inconvenience as production of legal representation involves the expenditure of an appreciable sum of money which in many cases may be out of all proportion to the balances standing to the credit of a deceased subscriber. To minimise the degree of inconvenience, therefore, it has been decided that where the amount is small and the claimant is the widow or a child of the subscriber and where there is other evidence to show that she is the heir to the estate, such as the fact that the rest of the estate and the provident fund money have gone to her and her children, the policy can safely be handed back to the widow without a formal deed of re-assignment. A letter would then be addressed to the Insurance Company stating that Government have no further claims against the policy and the company left to decide whether or not they should pay to the person who produces the policy on the evidence before them or on the production of_ legal ^ proof of succession. Such a procedure has been criticised as in conflict with the statutory rules which require a formal re-assignment. On the other hand, if the P^son who appears to be legally entitled to the policy is prepared to accept the policy without a formal deed of re-assignment Government cannot very well insist on a formal re-assignment, particularly as the claimant would thereby be committed to the expenditure of an appreciable_sum of money. If however, an Insurance Company were to insist on a re-assignment of such a policy to the person legally entitled to receive it there would be no other alternative but to request the party claiming the policy to produce legal representation and on this being done to re-assign the policy to such person. A reference has been made in paragraph 11 (2) above to cases of hardship to widows of subscribers. This arises because, when a wife divests herself of rights accruing under an original assignment in order that the policy may be assigned to Government, the policy can only be re-assigned to her on production of proof of legal title; to obtain such proof in the shape of probate of a will, letters of administration or a succession certificate she has to pay heavy ad valorem fees. It was the practice therefore to sanction an assignment by the subscriber in favour of his wife or children subsequent to the assignment in favour of the wife and subject thereto. It was apprehended that such a subse quent assignment would attract the provisions of rule 26 of the General Provident Fund (Central Services) Eules, but it was considered that, so9 long as the assignment was with the sanction of the Government, Govern ment waived the enforcement of the rule. This practice, however, should not be further countenanced, as an unobjectionable method by which re-assignment can be secured without production of probate or letters of administration has been devised and will be available to subscribers. It is as follows: — (i) Cancellation of the assignment in Form 1 in favour of (government if one is already in existence; (ii) Execution of an assignment in favour of the subscriber and his wife as joint tenants in the following form: — 'I (here state name and description of the assured) do hereby assign and transfer the benefit of the within policy and all moneys receivable thereunder or in respect thereof to myself and my (here state relationship and name) To Hold the same unto myself and the said or survivor as joint tenants and I declare that on the death of either, the receipt of the survivor shall be a sufficient discharge to the Insurance Com pany within named. Dated the day of 193 . Witnesses : — (1) (Signature) (2) and (iii) Execution of an assignment by the subscriber and his wife or her husband in Eorm 2 in favour of Government. Such an assignment has the effect of creating a joint tenancy in favour of the wife with the result that she is entitled to claim the policy in her own right as a surviving co-tenant on the death of the subscriber.

Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, To All Chief Commissionersv ■ Subject:- Deliheralisation of the rules regulating the grant of advances.from Provident Funds. Sir, ■ , I am directed to state that the Government of India have had under consideration the question of tightening up the rules relating to the grant of advances from Provident Funds. Experience has shown that the 'balance in the Provi dent Fund : of the average subscriber is often meagre and that frequently such savings as have been accumulated have •been depleted by advances granted prior to the death of the subscriber► This results in tlie frustration of the primary object of Provident Funds, namely to ensure provi sion for the family of a subscriber in the event of his death in service. The grant of advances for reasons other than those of strict emergency results in the Provident Fund becoming little more than a savings bank account for which the special privileges which attach to provident funds, such &amp;s the market rate of interest, exemption from income-tax: and especially from attachment against debts would be unjustifiable. 2. In the case of the Central Services, the grant of. advances is regulated by Rule 15 of the General Provident Fund (Central Services) Rules and the Executive Instruc tions contained in. Appendix B. There are similar rules and instructions regulating the grant of advances from the Contributory Provident Fund (India) to CentralServices. These rules and. instructions make it sufi ly clear that advances from Provident Funds should not sanctioned except in cases of strict emergency. In prac tice, however, the sanctioning authorities who have ulti mately absolute discretion under the Rules to sanction an advance, being guided only hy certain illustrative examples, naturally find it difficult to know exactly where to draw the line and are prone to look upon the Provident Fund deposits as the 'subscriber's own money' and to treat the restrictions lightly*. Both the Central Government and Provincial Governments have found it necessary in the past to issue circulars deprecating this tendency and bringing the rules and instructions to the notice of sanctioning authorities, but no -improvement has been noticeable. 3. The Government of India have therefore come to the conclusion that the only practical way of checking the tendency referred to in paragraph 2 above and of securing that provident funds make effective provision for a sub scriber' s dependants is'(i) to restrict the discretion at present resting with subordinate authorities to sanction advances- beyond a certain definite limit, (ii) to add a further provision restricting an advance to half the amount at the credit of the subscriber in the Fund, and (iii) to prescribe in definite terms the purposes for which alone advances may be granted• the General Provi dent Fund (Central Services) Rules and'the Contributory / Provident Fund Rules (India) have accordingly been amended in this sense as will be observed from the copies of the Notifications enclosed. The Secretary of State has also agreed to make similar amendments to the-Provident Fund Rules for his services. : 4. Since it is desirable that there should as far as possible be -uniformity in this matter, I am to state that the Governor-General in Council has decided that the General Provident Fund Rules framed by you under Rule-3- ecf jr 44(d} of the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1930 ? with his previous sanction, should 'be amended on the lines of the amendments made to Rule 15 of the General Provident Fund (Central Services) Rules. Drafts of the necessary amendments may according ly be forwarded at an early date for issue by the Governor-General in Council.

Government of India. Finance Department. New Delhi, the 2nd April 1940. office immvmjil Subject:- Temporary advances from Provident Funds. This Department has recently been requested to regularize ex post facto a number of irregular sanctions to temporary advances from provident funds accorded by Departments of the therefore Government of India... The undersigned is/directed to invite a reference to the Finance Department notifications, No. 18(IV)-R.11/34, dated the 17th August 1939, (copies of which were forwarded to all Departments), amending the rules for the grant of temporary advances from the General Provident Fund and the Contributory Provident Fund (India), which appear to have been overlooked, and to request that the necessary prior sanction of the Finance Department may be sought in every case in which such sanction is required. 2. The undersigned is also to invite attention to the general principles enunciated in the Finance Department letter Mo.1309-F.E., dated the 24th November 1916 (copy enclosed), and to request the strict application of those principles in future in considering applications for the grant of advances, so that with the rules as amended it may be possible to avoid the f rustr at i on of the fundamental objects for which provident funds are maintained.. ^prvr-C' Deputy Secretary to'the Government of India. To The several Departments of the Government of India, ^including the Secretary to Governor General (Public), (Reforms),etaCopy of letter Mo. 13-09-F.R., dated the 24th November 1916, frora the Secretary to the Government of India 9 Finance Depart ment to all.. Provincial Governments and Chief Commissioners. I am directed to invite a reference to rule 11 of the General Provident Fund Rules, which regulates the grant of advances from the Fund for special purposes. It has been represented to the Government of India that sanctioning authorities: have in some cases given a wider interpretation to this rule than was intended when It was framed, a result which is possibly due to some extent to the way in which the second clause of the rule has hitherto been worded. The Government of India the have accordingly decided to. amend ; rule 11(2) in/manner shown in .the annexure to this letter, and I am to takethis opportunity of communicating the following remarks as to the general principles which, in their opinion, should determine the grant of an advance from-1h§-. fund.. 2.It should be remembered that the fund is designed solely for the protection of a subscriber's family against his sudden death or, if he survives until retirement, to provide both him and them with additional resources in his old age. Anything which interferes with a subscriber's normal accumulations detracts from these purposes and tends to defeat the true object of the fund. Rule 11 merely permits a temporary and wholly exceptional departure from the real purpose of the scheme, and unless it is strictly interpreted, there is danger that subscribers mil come to regard the fund as an ordinary banking account, the existence of which absolves them frora the necessity of providing for the normal incidents of life with the prudence which a private individual would exercise. The inevitable result, if this tendency is countenanced will be to discourage thrift, and to leave the subscriber with a.depleted account, at the time when it ought to be most helpful; to him or his family. Sanctioning authorities ought,therefore, to have no hesitation in resisting any attempt to use the fund as a cheap loan account, and in enforcing the altogether exceptional character of rule 11. as aprovision to meet urgent needs which, could, not ordinarily have been anticipated* Every prudent.married, man, for example, should be prepared td meet a certain demand upon his resources on account of doctor's bills g and it is only when the burden is exceptionally prolongedor the necessity unusually grave and sudden, that he ought to.think of making use of the provident fund for this object. Similarly withdrawal should not be ' allowed to cover the passage money of . a subscriber or. any membe • of his family in ordinary circumstances, or even in circum stances which, though they seldom recur, are nevertheless, normal; as when the son of a subscriber is sent to school in .Europe, or when the subscriber or his wife returns for some incident in their children 1 s education, or to establish them in a profession. When, however, a voyage is urgently necessary, for instance to secure in.Europe specialist treatment unobtain able in India, the fund may properly be drawn upon. 3. For the same reasons, a careful scrutiny should be applied to requests for withdrawals on account of marriage or funeral expenses. In tiie first place, t.hfe rule does not permit the use/of deposits in the fund to meet the marriage expenditure of Europeans, and .withdrawal for this purpose should never be allowed. Even where ceremonial expenditure is by religious custom obligatory, its extent should nevertheless be limited by the resources of the., family, and no subscriber should be enabled to enhance such expenditure on the strength of deposit , in the fund. An advance from the fund can legitimately be made for obligatory ceremonial.expenditure where no other resources exist, but not in order to raise such expenditure to a more pretentious scale. 4. The Government of India have no desire to limit the powers of local Governments and other authorities to. sanction withdrawals from the fund in cases of abSQlute necessity;, but His Excellency the Governor General in CoundL they feel sure that Ilslio mlr^eiJBa^iHi^x Go vernor (in Council) his Honour T&gt;ne Lieutenant Governor you will recognise that the adoption of r the principles enunciated in this letter is in. the real interest' of the body of subs cribers of the fund, and I am to reauest that they may be followed in future.Office of the The Memo.

Subject;- final payment, in stealing, of the sum at the credit Cf subscribers governed by the Superior Civil Services or the Central Services (India Provident Fund)(Sterling Accounts) Rules, 1934, Sir, I am directed to invite a reference to rule 11(1 )(i) of the Superior- Civil Services and the Central Services (India Provident Fund) (Sterling Accounts) Rules, 1934, and to say that the Government of India have had under con sideration the question of final payment of deposits to subscribers who declare their intention to reside, after retirement, in a country where the rupee is not legal tender, but. are prevented from carrying out their intention ei-th-er on account of re-employment, in India, after retire ment, in connection with the war, or because they are compelled to stay in India due to conditions brought about by the war. The rules referred to lay down only that a subscriber should satisfy Government,of his intention to reside after retirement in a country'where the rupee is not legal tender; they do not stipulate any period within which he must take up residence in such a country. Though in normal times any undue delay in leaving India to take up such'residence may be construed as pr&amp;of of the absence of an intention to reside in a country where the rupee is not legal tender, in the circumstances mentioned above, such an inference will not be warranted. The Government of India have therefore decided that if the subscribers, in question apply, when the amounts standing to their credit in their Provident Fund accounts have become payable, for final payment of such suns in sterling, payments in sterling nay be made, if they satisfy Government that they intend to reside in a country where the rupee is not legal tender soon after the war is over. The above decision will apply to all officers under the administrative control of the Governor General in Council irrespective of whether they are under the rule making control of the Governor General in Council or the Secretary of State. 2. These orders will not in any way affect the restric tions, if any, which may be placed from time to time on the transfer of credit to countries outside India under the Indian Exchange Control Regulations.

Sir, Since some doubt appears to exist as to how the expression n amount already advanced'^ in rule 15(l)(c)(ii) of the General Provident Fund (Central Services) Rules should be interpreted, I am directed to say that the expression should be taken as referring to the first advance that may be granted not exceeding two-thirds of the amount admissible under clause (c)(i)c» Thus, under clause if a subscriber who had already been granted an advance not^exceeding two- thirds of the amount admissible under clause (o)(i) applies for^a second advance (not exceeding the limit specified in that clause) within twelve months of the final repayment of the first advance or while it is still current^ the authority who sanctioned the first advance will be competent to sanction the second advance without a reference to higher authority4 l'lj is possible that the sum of the two advances may not exceed tWo^thirds of the amount admissible under clause (c)(i) and that the individual subsdriber may apply for a third advance within twelve months of the final repayment of the two previous advances or while one or both of them is still currents I am to say that in Such a case^ it Would be necessary for the original_sanction ing authority to seek the sanction of the next higher administrative authority to the grant of the third advance. 2 # The expression 'amount already advanced' in rule 12(c) of the Contributory Provident Fund Rules (India) should be similarly interpreted. _ . , I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Under Secretary to the Government of India.

The procedure outlined in 'the sub-paragraph permits the executi n: of an assign ment in fav ur of the subscriber and his wife as j :int tenants and a doubt has arisen whether any person other oh on tho subscriber 1 a wife, e.g. a son or a eaioghter may be mentioned as a 'joint tenant'. ' The reference to 'wife', it is presumed, is only illustrative, and if so it would seem that any member of a subscriber 1 s family may be mentioned as a joint tenant. This view appears to be further supported by the words in brackets 11 (here state relationship -and nemo)' in the 'joint tenant' assignment form, 'if it is held that the son can be a joint tenant along with- the father the further question arises whe ther on behalf of the minor son who is not legally coopo tent to assign •the policy the fathor can assign the policy to the Governmont as ok; oetural guarlian in Form (2) of the Third Sche dule to the Provident Fund Rules.

The Accountant-General, Madras, states that the form of assignment prescribed appears to contemplate the inclusion in the assignment of only one member of the family besides the assured end holds the view that the inclusion of more than one member of the family as joint tenant is not permissible. In support of his view, the Accountant-General has referred to Note 2 under Hulo 21 of the ild General Provident Fund Rules, which definitely prohibited assignment of a policy for the benefit of more than ;ne beneficiary 'in view of the attendant legal difficulties'. It seems to this Government that the assignment in favour of the Government by the subscriber and two others is on exactly the same footing as an assignment by the subscriber and one other person and that the form prescribed by the Government of Indie, may easily be adapted for this purpose, viz. for an assignment in favour of the insurer and two or more other persons.
