BEGINS: Addressed to Paris telegram No.3474 of 2nd November repeated for information to Bagdad. Bagdad telegram 1067. Please inform the French Government that French military aircraft cannot use Habbaniyah and Shaiba airfields till further notice. We hope period of interruption will be short. The reason is Iraqi Government decree (reported in Bagdad telegrams 1054 and 1055) forbidding flights of aircraft over Iraq without notification as from 25th October. The decree is no doubt due to fear of Jews. 2. Detection by Iraqi Government of French aircraft attempting to use airfields would destroy the confidential Anglo-French understanding based on the Anglo-French Air Transit Agreement. It would also probably prevent the French from enjoying facilities even when the present emergency ends. For your own information, it would also affect our own position. 3. If the French prove difficult you may quote the Air Transit Agreement Article l(b), last sentence 'in the case of airfields or air bases situated in territory not under the authority or jurisdiction of the other Contracting Party, the facilities granted shall not infringe the sovereignty of the countries concerned'. /4. Air2 U. Air Ministry will inform Air Attache direct of possible alternative routes for French aircraft, 5* A similar telegram is being sent to Karachi.

Following is text of telegram from Bagdad, to Foreign Office No. 1O 67 &gt; 29 th October, repeated to British Middle East Office Cairo, Karachi No. 18 and Paris (Saving). Begins : Your telegram No. 474 of June 7th, 1947# Anglo-French air transit agreement. As I have reported in my telegrams Nos. 1054 and 1055&gt; Iraqi Government, from fear of flights by Jewish aircraft over Bagdad, have notified that all aircraft, civil or military, must follow instructions in notice to airmen No. 5 of 1948, v/hich provides for flying through specified lanes and at certain periods and avoidance of prohibited zones. Habbaniyah and Shaiba are in prohibited zones. I have refused to agree to proposed application of the new regulations to R.A.F. aircraft. In the circumstances it is in my opinion most undesirable to continue, for the time being, the arrangement by which French military aircraft use Habbaniyah and Shaiba without agreement or knowledge of Iraqi Government. We have always been liable to have to face awkward questions about arrangement, v/hich cannot be kept secret indefinitely. The use of Habbaniyah and Shaiba for purposes not strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty would, if it became known assist the attacks v/hich are continually made on our retention of these bases. A request made now to the Iraqi Government to sanction this arrangement would probably be /refusedrcfust'cV'^nd would reveal previous use of HatTbaniyah Ly French. 2. I therefore recommend that the French should ho uraod to re-route weekly transit services and other non-schedulod military aircraft outside Iraq, for the duration of the current restrictions at the end of the Palestine campaign it may he possible to obtain agreement of the Iraq.i Government to the use of our bases by French military aircraft.

At first sight it seems satisfactory, but we are getting our Legal Advisers to have a look at it and we will let you know if they have any comments. If you would prefer to discuss the matter, let us know and we will call a meeting. F. A. K. Harrison, Esq., Commonwealth Relations Office— Brit &lt;r .*.8th October Thank yen for your l«ttirs of October 6th and October 9th about the Anglo-French Military Air Agreement* # We have now had further discussions on this subject oth with the French Air Force authorities and with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The short notice given to us of the withdrawal of the R.A.F. facilities at Calcutta caused us some embarrassment. In fact your letter informing us of the present position reached me only 48 hours before the date of withdrawal. The French authorities are endeavouring to apply the terms of the draft Agreement, although this has not yet been signed, and Article 2 (b) provides for 28 days period of notice of withdrawal from any air field mentioned in the Annex; in the case of Calcutta notice was given so late that it was impossible to stop two French aircraft which had already left and were scheduled to transit through Dum- Dum. The Air Attache therefore sent an urgent signal to the Air Ministry, asking them to give what help they could to these two aircraft. &gt; The French now assume that in due course they will be notified that the R.A.F. also intend to withdraw from the other bases which they are now using in India and Pakistan. If this is so they would wish their aircraft to be serviced by B.O.A.C. personnel (assuming, of course, that the Corporation is willing to undertake this commitment) and they would like us to make the necessary approach to B.O.A.C. on their behalf. There remains also the question of securing the consent of the Q-overnments of India, and presumably in due course, of Pakistan to the servicing of French planes by B.O.A.C. As I explained to you on the telephone, the French would like us to undertake with them a joint demarche in New Delhi to secure this consent. They do not intend to raise again with the Indians the general question of permission for the flight of French aircraft through India, but propose to rely on the verbal assurance they received some time ago from Nehru that, for the time being, they may stage through Indian territory hine aircraft per month in each 8 direction. This permission was given verbally by Nehru who at the time apparently asked that the French should not make an official request as he feared difficulties with other members of his Cabinet. The French have made, I feel, a genuine effort to meet us over this Agreement and have readily understood the difficulties with which we are faced when entering a firm commitment about facilities which we are or were offering to them in Egypt, Irak, Burma and India. I very much hope, therefore, that we shall be prepared to meet them to the extent of authorising the High Commissioner in New Delhi to undertake with his French colleague a joint demarche to the Government of India for permission to enable B.O.A.C. to service French aircraft. It may be of course that the Indians nay reply that they wouud prefer to provide staging facilities at Dum-Dum themselves. In that case the French wish to/ The Hon. R.J.M. Wilson, Foreign Office, London. S.W.l* lto reconsider the situation, since such an arrangement would involve Rupee expenditure which they may be unwilling to undertake. • As regards the Agreement itself, we have now had 1urther discussions based on the French draft forwarded to the Foreign 01iice wit^our letter 392/18/47 of April 26th. Subject to your approval we mive agreed the following modifications:- (a) Article 2 to be deleted and to be replaced by the following: 'Au cas ou l , une des deux parties contractantes serait amenee &amp; se retirer d*un des,terrains situes sur lea routes indiquees et utilises par 1*autre partie contractante, il lui appartiendrait: a) de donner un preavis de 28 jours a 1*autre partie; b) de faire assurer par tout orgftnisme d*aviation civile existant, les services et facilites prevus &amp; 1'accord, dans la mesure du possible et^avec ^agrement du Qouvernement du pays interesse; c) de designer si possible un terrain de remplacement.' The purpose is, I think, clear. It avoids mentioning specifically any Government and makes it clear that the consent of interested Governments will be necessary if arrangements are made for the servicing of French aircraft other than by the R.A.F. (b) In Article 10 the following sentence, to be added after the first paragraph:- 'En outre cheque partie contractante reserve le droit de revoir 1*accord au cas ou les facilites reciproques accordees de part et d*autre se trouvent sensiblement modifiees. ,, This is designed to safeguard the French in case we find that in time we are no longer able to provide facilities which we are at present giving under the Agreement and which form a quid pro quo for the facilities the French are giving us. They fear that if reciprocity is not stressed in the wording of the Agreement there may be some embarrass ing criticism (e.g. from the Communists). What the French have mainly in mind is their route to the Far East and if we were unable to provide any facilities for them in Irak or India or both, the route would no longer be possible and their aircraft would have to be shipped out to Indo-China. This would mean that the Agreement could no longer be considered as reciprocal. In these circumstances the safeguarding clause might be invoked, necessitating a new agreement. I think, however, that Air Ministry should know that even if this contingency arose the French would in all probability continue to provide us with the staging facilities we require, though under some other form of agreement. (c) It was also agreed that the Annexes 'A' and ’'B' should be completely recast. I enclose copies of the new versions. Instead of mentioning all the bases on the route at which facilities are to be provided, the two terminals only are specified. At the same time Section 4 of the Annexes provides for an exchange of views between the air authorities concerned from time to time so that detailed facilities required along these routes may be opceif'iod. This new form of annex L avoids the difficulty of mentioning such bases as Nairobi and Lydda, where we are in full control, while suppressing others such as Habbanyah and Khartoum because the consent of the Govermnent concerned might not be forthcoming. It should prove more flexible and also has the advantage of enabling the air authorities of the two countries to consult together about the provision of alternative bases to replace those from which we may have to withdraw, without havi ^°; make formal amendment to the Annexes of the Agreement. The new draft seems to us to be a considerable improve ment and we much hope, therefore, that the Air Ministry will be prepared to accept it. The negotiations for the Agreement have been dragging on so long now that it seems essential to make a really d^^rmined effort to get it agreed and signed as quickly as possible b^ore any further hitches occur. I should l?e very grateful, therefore, if you could let me know your reactions to all this as soon as possible. Incidentally in the course of our discussions the French raised the question of our ability to implement the 28 days' warning provided for in the new Article 2 (a). They point out that in the case of Calcutta we were only able to give 48 hours* notice and wonder whether this is to prove the exception or the rule. I see that the Air Ministry letter informing you of the position at Dum-Dum was dated October 2nd, and probably it did not reach you until a day or two after that. You may therefore like to draw the Air Ministry's attention to this point.

They have merely been informed that Pw.A.F. staff would no longer be available at Bum Dum but that it was understood in raris that B.O.A.C. would be in a position to afford necessary facilities. Method of dealing with problem has apparently been left to Embassy*s discretion and having regard to Indian public opinion v/hich of course is strongly against permitting French any facilities to disadvantage of Vietnam they contemplate asking B.CAA.C. representative here whether or not facilities could be made available as a matter of routine without approaching Government of India and possibly raising thereby an awkward political issue. On this point we made clear to Embassy that His Majesty*s Government would be prepared to ask B.O.A.C. to provide facilities only if Government of India had no objection. French agreement with India referred to in opening sentence of your telegram is purely informal and not written as was agreement in regard to civil aircraft. 3. We are now informing B.O.A.C. representative of the position so that he may be prepared for any approach the Embassy may make to him.- It would obviously not be desirable for B.O.A.C. to lend themselves to any arrangement to which Indian Government might object: and in our view there is every possibility that Indian Government would object since military (as opposed to civil) aircraft are involved.Q( 8133 (S 7413^1*6/17) Ft.i an ami..

The Honourable R.J.M.Wilson, Western Department, Foreign Office, LONDON, S.W.1. *8th August ^^hl• 7413 I tnr; 1347 Your letters z 6208/U6/17 of the 16th July and Z 6822/46/17 of the 1st August about the Anglo-French Air Transit Agreement. The Air Attaches office and myself have now dis cussed this once more with both the French military authorities and the Quai d* Orsay. We learn that from the French point of view a serious difficulty has arisen, namely that they see no prospect of obtaining the agreement of the Government of India to transit through their territory. The French Legation in New Delhi have advised the Ministry of Foreign Affairs laat there is little prospect at the moment of a French approach on this subject being successful, if only because the Indians before agreeing to grant the French request, would probably consult Viet Nam. The French Legation are moreover reluctant to make the approach at present, in order not to prejudice negotiations which are in progress about the future of the French settlements in India after the transfer of power. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs are therefore reconsidering their instructions to New Delhi on the subject. As regards Egypt, the French confirm that they no longer require facilities at either Fayid or any other airfield on Egyptian territory. If in future a French air craft requires to land on an Egyptian airfield, the French will approach the Egyptians direct for individual clearance in the usual way. Since our conversation with the French on May 30th reported in my letter 392/23/47 of June 2nd, at which they informed us that they proposed in future to avoid Egyptian territory, only two French aircraft have landed at Fayid and those did so because the instructions to avoid Egypt had not yet been issued. The French however say, and the Air Attache confirms, tha^their traffic through Egypt has now entirely stopped. We therefore suggest that you might like to reply to the Egyptian protest to the effect that we are no longer affording facilities at Fayid for French aircraft. The French, whom we have consulted un officially, would be in agreement with this reply. The question of the Sudan is more difficult. We have told the French that in order to obtain official permis sion to use Wady Haifa they should approach both the Egyptians and ourselves, making it clear in their note to the Egyptians that they are sending an identical request to His Majesty’s Government. The French say that while they are, exploring alternative ways of routing their aircraft to Madagascar i.e. through the Belgian Congo, they cannot send all their aircraft in this way and from time to time will still require facilities at Wady Haifa. They fear that if they make an official request to the Egyptians for facilities there, the Egyptians may turn it down. Moreover they would greatly prefer in the present state of Franco-Egyptian relations not to make any request to the Egyptians at all. They therefore ask whether we should see any objection to their continuing to use Wady Haifa as at present, without notification to the Egyptians, in the hope that the latter will not interfej Would you please let us have your views about this? Whi! The Honourable R. J. M. Wilson, Western Department, Foreign Office. mb- 2 - w© are ignorant of conditions in the Sudan it seems to us quite possible that 4he Egyptians may be unaware that we are giving the the French facilities at Wady Haifa, and that there would therefore be little risk in leaving matters as they are at present. There are I think two other outstanding points on which you require answers from us. These are 1) Palestine The French have told us that they intend to use Aquir in future and not Lydda. The only reason why they are using an airfield in Palestine at all is that , they are precluded from using Fayid or Almaza. 2) Iraq. The French confirm that they are willing to omit Habaniyah and Shaibah from the Annex to the agreement. The following are the points on which we still require answers from you: 1) The question of landing fees at Sharjah and permission for the use of this airfield, 2) the question of the approach to the authorities at Masirah and Salalah for permission for the French to land there in emergencies, and 3) the result of the approach to the Government of Burma. aboul We should be grateful if you would let us know it the above in due course. But meanwhile, we think you should laiow that the French regard the facilities required for the air route to Indo-China, with transiting rights through India, as the most important part of the agreement. They are in fact inclined to the view that if they do not obtain these facilities the agreement can no longer be recog nised as fully reciprocal. • If therefore they are unable to obtain, satisfaction fron the Indians, they may be unwilling to conclude the agreement in its present form. They have indeed already hinted as much. We have little doubt how ever that they will in any case be willing to give us the facilities we require, though under some other form of agreement. J.E.

As the French, by reason of the type of aircraft they intend to employ on their routes to the Far East, must have landing facilities in this part of the world, they will have to agree to pay whatever is necessary. In this event we feel that the fees should be paid by the R.A.F., with subsequent settlement with the French under the financial clause of the agreement. Since such an arrangement would obviate currency difficulties. If it is found necessary to charge landing fees the French would like official notification. Masirah and Salalah. There is no specific French requirement at either of these air fields, though by the terms of the agreement their aircraft are given permission in an emergency to land at any British-Controlled base. Presumably therefore our represen tative with the Sultan of Muscat should be warned of the possibility of French military aircraft landing in an emergency at either of these two airfields and should obtain the necessary agreement in principle* *1 t/cv' 0 *E* The Hon* John Wilson, Foreign Office, ^— Millard.

Furthermore, it is clear from the considerations out forward in paragraph 2 of the Bagdad telegram that a request by the French themselves would be likely to have unfortunate results both for them and for us. 3. In the circumstances, therefore, if you have no objection you should approach the French Government and explain to them the Ambassador’s views as stated in the second paragraph of his telegram. No (repeat no) mention whatever should however be made of the recent military talks with the Iraqis. You should explain verbally to the French that in the circumstances we can at the moment see no way of including the Iraqi bases in the agreement. Ye could not for example agree to a confidential exchange of letters or aide-memoire, since_ this would amount to going behind the backs of our Iraqi Allies and if exchange were to become known they would justifiably feel strong resentment towards us for making an agreement with a third party about facilities on Iraqi soil, and this could only nave harmful repercussions on our relations with Iraq, which is a thing His Majesty s Government could not contemplate. This is quite apart from virtual certainty that it 'would result m withdrawal of the facilities which the French require. to enjoy the facilities they have in the past enjoyed at Habbaniya and Shaiba, as long as they remain under our control. You should make every effort to get the French to accept this position. If however they takethe view that the inclusion of the Iraqi Bases is essential to the conclusion of the agreement, you should let us know whether they have any alternative plan. 4.

Stevenson, of the Air Attache’s office, and myself had a meeting with the French on fay 30th to explain to them our point of view about the approaches to the various governments which are to provide transit facilities for French aircraft under the Agreement. 1). India. We explained thrt we felt very definitely that the approach should come from the French themselves and that it would not even be desirable for us to lend them support, since any action which we took might prejudice the French approach. .^e also explained that* the Viceroy had expressed the view that-the French would have^ difficulty in obtaining a firm commitment from the Indians for any thing like a period of 4 years. The French took this a ^ lci undertook to consider whether in that case it would not be desira to avoid the riek of creating an unfavourable impression with the Indians by asking for a period of 4 years straight away; and either to ask for a shorter period or not to specify any period at all* Stevenson however, wi o was backed up by the representative of the Defense Rationale, pointed out that from the military point of view it Was most desirable to h ve a definite period, prefer ably a minimum of 4 years, laid down for purposes of long term planning. It was also agreed that it would be necessary to ask the Indians to agree to some cancell tion clause, laying down the -period which must elapse before denunciation takes effect, on the lines of Article 10 of the French drrft. ^he Indians would other- v/ise be free to revoke the : gree ent at any moment.

May, ho»Z*bBQi+/k6/l 7 you say that we are approaching the Government of Bvirma about the Anglo-French Air Transit Agreement* Our attitude on this point is explained in my letter to Wtiitt#(tk of 29th Marolx, a copy of which was sent to you* I think that wo shall be prepared to approach the Cover iment of Burma forthwith, or at least as soon as we know that the French are approaching the Governnent of India* . But for this purpose we should require to have the latest version of the draft text of the Agreement, and of the Annexes* Annex B will presumably show what exactly is the maximum traffic which the French are now asking* I assure the Financial Annex is as enclosed, in ,nlttHDk*s letter to you of 22nd April* It will be essential to place before the Government of iXirma a complete and up-to-date copy of the draft agreement and we should be glad to have the material from you or the Air ilinistry. 1 am sending a. copy of this letter to Whlitflck and to Donaldson* Yours sincerely, &lt;S*U I* P, QIBSOM Hon* R*J* • Wilson, Western Department, Foreign Office*6 o o r; . 20th Hay, 1%7 2/C OA /y&lt;X^ oAc/, I am sorry we have bee** so Ion*/ in replying to your letter of the 26th April about the Anglo-French Air Transit Agreement, le have now however discussed this *hole question with the Air Ministry and have agreed with them as to the steps we should take to get this Agreement signed as soon as possible. feel first of all that it is no use -orking on the fi^al drafts until the various questions of transit through India, Iraq, Burma and iCgypt nave been cleared up* of course, il the French are willing to sign an agreement now excluding these territories, and are prepared to add them to the agree ment later, we are quite prepared to sign now, but presumably the French wish fcs to clear ucse questions up first. 3* First of all about India. You ?*ill of course realise that India’s present agreement to the flow of eighteen French aircraft a month does not cover any stated period. We are advised tnat in present circumstances there is no possibility of India binding herself to anything like the period of four years mentioned in Article X of the French draft. The most India might agree to would be six months with an option for renewal. An approach to the Government of India is therefore necessary* 4* The Viceroy himself has given it as his very definite opinion that »e should not approach the Indian Government ourselves on this matter, and &gt; e do not think tnat he would even be willing to support a French approach to the Indian Governraeiit* Moreover, the ecretary of the Indian efence Department states that the Government of India will not ratify the Agreement unless the French Goverximent approach the Government of Ixidia direct. You should tell the ^rexxch tuat in existing circumstances it ia the coxisidered opixxion of our authorities aho deal with India tnat the chaxxces of the ixidia»v Goverximent agreeing to give the facilities which the Freiich want will not be improved if we support this approach and it would certainly be very bad tactics for ua to take the lead. ;e therefore propose to leave it to the French to approach the Indian Governxuant on theix* owxi. if they are . repared to sign tne agreement beforehand a clause could be inserted saying, for example, that 'the l ranch Goverximent will enter into negotiations with the Government of India with a view to the conclusion of a separate agreemerxt in respect of the f cilities required in the territories under the control of th t Govern..ent'* But they would probably rather wait to see what success they have with the liidian Government* 5* As regards Iraq, we have sent a telegram to our Ambassador there briefly explaining the position to him axxd asking him to approach the Iraqi Government in consultation with nis French colleague. e should be glad if you would ask the uai d'orsay to instruct their representative in Iraq to confer with the /Ambassador and eoiicert an approach to the Iraqis Aith him. It may be, of course, that the Ambassador would prefer that this approach should be exitlrely a Frex;ch affair and e must be prepared for this eventuality. ■ 6./ G.

'he French Liaison Officer has informed H.Q., R.A.F., mediterranean and Kiddle &amp;a=&gt;t that military airerf ft carrying civilian passe/igers will avoid Egyptian territory, but we require confirmation that this will be acceptable to the French as a permanent arrangement. It is, however, becoming urgent th^t concurrence of the gyptian Government be obtained to continue passage of French military aircraft 'through ^gypt. Air Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean and piddle ast would prefer that French military aircraft carrying military passengers should use Almaza, where tt.e Egyptian Air Force is still stationed. While this would suit un very well as it would relieve the R.A.F. of all responsibility for French military aircraft in Sgypt, we believe that the French would prefer Fayid, because they would get better service from the R.A.F. tnan from tueRgyptiaxi iir Force. 8. As in the case of India, it would be a mistake for us to approach the Egyptian Goveriiir.exit on behalf of the French in the present state of our relations with Kgypt, and I am afraid that the French will have to do this job themselves. I think that the j osition will be obvious to them. Ae eug&lt; est that they ask the Egyptians for facilities at either Fayid or ;lmaza, whichever may be found mutually convexxient. 9. Could you let us know how the French react to all this? If they agree, and our various approaches are successful, or if the French are willing to conclude the agreement before the outcome of some of all of the approaches is known, then I think we should try to get one of the Legal Advisers to go over to Paris and get the draftixig done propeifcr. 10.

Position as known to us here is as follows. During and since the war French military aircraft passing through Egypt have used R^*.F. facilities at ^Imaza. French had a small detachment of service personnel at that airfield operating radio control station. When we withdrew to the Canal Zone the FrenchYar Ministry formally requested that . this detachment and its equipment should be moved with the R.n.F. to any other station we cared to name in the Canal Zone and that facilities which we had previously granted to them should be continued. This was arranged and the detachment is nov; at Fayid, which French military aircraft are using. 2. Rir attache has consulted French u ir authorities informal y. Their impression is that these arrangements were never submitted to the Egyptian authorities. The latter however must be aware of the passage of French military aircraft through their territory since, when our own facilities were moved from ^Imaza, the Egyptian authorities objected to French aircrews in military uniform landing on this civilian airfield. Rs a result all French military aircraft nov; land at Fayid. 3. We have now received an official note from the Ministry of Foreign affairs re questing, us^ to approach^ Governments of Egypt, Iraq, India and Burma for facilities for 'transit through their respective 'territories provided for in iinnex to proposed Military-^ir agreement^ It will therefore be necessary for us to place the facilities^at present enjoyed by French military aircraft for transit through Egypt on an official basis, by securing Egyptian Government’s consent* French Government prefer that the irst approach to the Egyptians should be made by us on their behalf as in the case of the approach to the iTovern- ments of India and Burma. The reason for this is that if we fail it will still be open to them to try again. If, however,- 2 - ^rr'^ UCha , n a PPf oach to ' thQ Egyptian Government might nvolve the risk of the latter withdrawing facilities which nnl^H ai f &gt;raft at present enjoy, I should like to be in a position to warn the French authorities in advance of this possible result.

It is now accepted that the French Government must approach the Indian G-overnment direct hut two questions remain:- (1) The reference to India in the Agreement. ( 2 ) Whether the Viceroy should be asked to support the French approach. As to ( 1 ) I sti,!! feel that it would be very much better merely to say in the Agreement that there Yri.ll be a separate arrangement covering facilities in India to be concluded between the French and Indian G-overaments. The main reason for this is that although y *3 asked for the G-overnment of India* s views on the draft as long ago as 31st January they nave made no comment. If they had gap Tie objection I should have expected them to say so before this. Moreover, the draft xirticle 11(b)(iij (see flag F) speaks of airfields and bases 'maintained by the British military authorities in India.' This is hardly a correct description of lacilities maintained at the expense of' Indian revenues under the control of the Indian Government. As regards ( 2 ) I do not thinK: we ought to as : the Viceroy to intervene on behalf of the French at aqy rate until tney nave ..iade t-ieir approach* - ls%The Hon. R.J.L'.

While I agree that in present circumstances it is desirable that the French Govemment should make tneir own direct approach to the Government of Ind.,a (and Govemment of Burma) ? I see no reason why we should not make it known to the Government of India (and Government of Burma) that H.M.G. would welcome such an arrangement, assuming that such an arrangement would be agreeable to the Government of India (and Govemment of Burma).Mr. Hender son S. of S. This is an awkward business as Sir William Croft's note'clearly explains. The French want us to pull their chestnuts out of the Indian and Burma fires for them and not risk burning their own fingers. The Air Ministry are anxious to comply, because if the chestnuts are safely extracted they (and H.M.G. in the U.K.) will get their ^uid pro quo . Neither India nor Burma stand to gain anything (so far as can be seen) irom the deal. The obvious course is that the french should do their own work, without H.L.G's help as e ntrepr eneur. But if they do, then U.K. stands to lose Its fee - a very valuable one as the signal attached below the pink slip shows. I think the right course is, as proposed , to consult the Viceroy and Sir H. Ranee before deciding what line to take, either with Air Ministry (and France) or witi} the Government of India and Government of Burma. There are, you will see, two parallel files to be dealt with. D.T.M. 15/3.O'W) Sir D.T.Monteath I think you should see this. But I expect you will agree with the draft telegram to the Viceroy submitted by Mr .Donaldson. Government of India an extension of the arrangements now in force for service aircraft to traverse India. In return, the U.K. would get concessions from France, but India would not be in a position to derive any benefit. Also, apparently France would be getting through the U.K. concessions in Egypt and Iraq, which seems odd but is not our business. the UJC. got something for France from India, France gave the UJC. something and the U.K. gave India something, it might be all right. But it is not like that. I do not suppose India will be prepared to go further in this matter than they have already gone. But if they were so prepared it would be for the sake of the beaux yeux of the French and not for anything else • If we intervene they will not fail to recognise an attempt to use the thick stick, and will react accordingly. From the French point of view, therefore, one would have thought it was better for them to approach the Indians on their own, and they, airl probably the Air Ministry too, are mistaken in thinking that things of this sort are best achieved in these days by our throwing our weight about. But of course, if the French I get what they want from India on their own, they may not be 'so ready to give us concessions in their territory. That would be unfortunate, but 1 do not see how it can be helped.

Present arrangement is for: 1 aircraft each way each week 1 Halifax each way per month 8 per month 2 per month TOTAL 10 per month It is clear that Pandit Nehru has given this permission somewhat reluctantly.

As I see it, India gets little or no benefit from this Agreement which is to last for four years. The Air Ministry on the other hand get facilities in France and French North Africa, while France is mainly interested in % facilities in India and Burma en route to French Indo-China, \ It/It is difficult to picture a situation where aircraft of the Royal Indian Air Force would benefit fi;om this Agreement. I am also doubtful if it is wise to approach the Interim Government of India at this stage to enter into an Agreement with Great Britain and France. I feel India will want to conduct her own negotiations if indeed she wishes any such agreement at all with For these reasons I do not think we can approach the Government of India as requested, and further that India should not be asked to join in this Military Agreement. The best we can do I suggest is to put the case to the Viceroy with our views and seek his advice. A draft telegram is attached. The Burma Office have asked to see the action we propose, and after consultation with them an interim reply should be returned to the Air Ministry. France 6Tel. No. Abbey 3411. GSW/BMK Exi.®.5?.§.

INOEXEO Whitehall, S.w.l. 7th March, 1947 Dear Donaldson, Anglo-French Air Transit Agreement I refer to previous correspondence on the above subject, ending, at present, with my letter to- Harrison dated 28th January. 2* The French have now produced a redraft of the Agreement, and I attach a translation^ The annexes have been omitted, but, so far as India is concerned. Annex B is unchanged, with the important exception that the French want facilities for two aircraft per week in each direction, i.e. 16 aircraft a month, with an additional aircraft in each direction once a month making a total of 18 aircraft a month. No combat types are included; the aircraft would all be military transports (JU»52s, Dakotas • and Halifaxes) with guns and turrets removed.. 3. Although the French draft contains a number of verbal differences from the British draft, copies of which were enclosed with my letter of 28th January, there Is a most important difference of substance which concerns you. It Is Article 11(a). Our Article 11(b) said that the •grant of facilities to French military aircraft at any airfield or base which we maintained in India should be conditional upon the consent of the Government of India. The French, hov/ever, want us to say that the consent of the Government of India has been obtained by H.M.G. before they will sign the Agreement. The French point out that their main interest in the Agreement is the Indo-China route, and if they do not get these facilities for transit /through E.P. Donaldson, 2sq., India Office, King Charles Street, S. W. 1.1 through India and Burma, there will be little in the I Agreement to coui^ter-*balance the facilities which they are giving us. 4. It was represented to the French tl^at, from the point of view of tactics, it seemed to us preferable that they should approach the Government of India themselves. The French replied that they^definitely wished us to make the approach ourselves, for two reasons:- &lt; * * (a) Because the new French Minister to New t)elhi had not yet left for India and the Legation, there h$d not been set up. t - (b) Because the French felt that if they asked for • these facilities themselves and the Government of India ;yere to refuse, there ^wquld be no possibility of re-opening the question* ) Whereas if we made the original approach, and the Indians refused, it would still be open to 'the French to make a second approach themselves In other words they would have two bites at the cherry. 5. The conclusion of this Agreement is a matter of great importance to the R*A*F* for reasons which are made sufficiently clear In the attached extract from a recent signal which we sent to the A*G.G*— in— C•, India. • .. * 6.

I now write to ask if the India Office will be good enough to seek the agreement in principle of the Govern ment of India to the French’request. As stated above, { the aircraft are all unarmed transports; and it is not desired to sehd any further French Mosquitos or other { combat aircraft across India. You will see from Article X of the draft Agreement that it is Intended to make the Agreement for an initial period of four years, and we should of course very much like that period to cover all the flights with which the Agreement is concerned, including those across India. If, however, In present circumstances, the Government of India felt unable to I commit themselves for so long ahead, but would agree to, say, a year subject to possible renewal later, I under stand there is some chance that the French will accept. 8. The above is the substance of the French request. If the Government of India would agree in principle, the French would not mind if the wording of the Article were altered. When we recently discussed this matter, you told me that you thought the Government of India might insist on being named as a party to the Agreement, which would make it an agreement between Great Britain, France and India. Our feeling is that if India can agree to the request in principle, it should be possible to devise a suitable form of Agreement to satisfy all parties. j 9. Let me end by repeating that the conclusion of this Agreement is a matter of very great importance to the Air Ministry, and we should much appreciate it if you could put our request to the Government of India as soon as possible. 10. I am sending a copy of this letter to Gibson of the /BurmaPREiiMBLE The Government of the French Republic and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland have 3 * further agreed on the necessity for an agreement relating to the questions raised by the presence, transit and activity of their air forces and mutual facilities pertaining thereto.

The French Government have already made it clear that they are not prepared to sign the Anglo-French Military air agreement -until we have obtained the approval of the Government of India to their requirements. Under this agreement, we will obtain the long term right to operate our regular trunk route services, special flights, ferry and Refers aircraft across metropolitan France up to an intensity of 16 aircraft per day. Similar facilities will also be assured to us in Indo China. If the French do not sign the agreement and refuse ^ transit rights, all twin and single engined aircraft for Middle East and beyond will have to go by sea, and transport services will be limited to four engined aircraft operating at a considerably reduced frequency via Gibraltar. This will have a serious effect on the movement of priority traffic to all overseas commands.INWARD TELEGRAM A Hotted to External Copies to: - PerwoDS ^ Depy«US, So 'tv for Burma*.

The Foreign Office have had the text under review from the legal standpoint and have found it necessary to make fairly extensive changes in wording and presentation, although the substance of the agreement remains essentially the same as in the draft sent for your consideration in July. I enclose a copy of the revised version. Other Government Departments have agreed in principle with the proposals and we contemplate visiting Paris next Thursday, November 21st to agree the new text with the I.inist&amp;re des Armens. For the present we have safeguarded the position as regards facilities in Indian territory by the wording in Article 2(b)(ii), which has been suggested by the Foreign Office. It would, hov/ever, be very help ful if any comment you may have on the Agreement could reach me before the 21st. I may add that next week*8 discussion with the French is designed to secure agreement on staff level only; the proposals will thereafter be submitted to higher authority in both countries and I shall in any event consult you further before this is done.

The French nave also suggested that the period of ten years validity provided for i^Article XEII be reduced to four years; we she. 11 accept this if noccssery although in the interests of fom/ird strv-tcgic planning we should like the period to be longer. 2. Vo have also had replies from the other Departments to wheel we referred the agreement, except the India Office, The Ministry of Civil .Aviation and Colonial Office raise no objection in principle. The Burma Office have suggested amendments of dcta.il which are now incorporated in Articles VI and VIII; their official letters of 31st August and 9th October, copied to you, refer. They also wish provision made for safeguarding the rights of a future Government of Burma and perhaps you would sa.y whether, in your view, this can best be done by means of a supplementary Note or by inserting an additional clause in the Agreement itself. The India Office have not so far received the views of the Govt., ox India, on the proposals, but as time is running on we should like to press forward meanwhile with further action in anticipation that their response will be fa.voura.blc* 3* You will have seen the letter from Robinson of the Colonial Office to Edden, 22922/1/4-6 of the 20th August, suggesting that as the Agreement is not intended as applying to Dominion aircraft or Dominion territory, some such expression a.s /'United S.H.

The question next crises what nodifications, if any, should be nadc in the text of the Aaroenent to take account of the fact^-p.t nany of the airfields at which facilities are to be offered the French are located on territory not under British political control. Perhaps the point could be covered by adding-to Article II a new clause (d) worded as follows - '(d) Similar rights as at (a) (b) and (c) above in respect of territories not under British control, subject to the aqreonent of the responsible political authorities concerned, M Wg should appreciate your advice on this point. There is still no formal confirmation that the French wish us to negotiate on their behalf with Iraq, the Southern Arabian States, etc., but it is, I think, safe to assure this, 5, In connection with Articles VII and VIII the question has been raised whether aircraft landing at French or British airfields under this Arprocnent would automatically enjoy extra-territrriality. jvly understanding is that the Paris Convention of 1919 would afford freedom fren search but I should be glad of your confirmation. Naturally crews and passengers leaving the airfield would be subject to customs, etc. formalitio s. 6 , I an afraid the foregoing arc a formidable list of points, but we rjro most anxious to finalize this’ Agreement with as little further delay as- passible and should be most grateful if you could give these outstanding queries urgent consideration. It might then be desirable to hold a small inform-1 discussion, say on Wednesday next, the 30th October, to agree a draft for submission to Adnisters or the Chiefs of Staff, as appropriate, before referring; back (v/c hope finally) to the French, We should also like at that discussion to discuss the . precise channel through which, subject to Ministerial concurrence, reference back to the French should be made. The French have lately been showing some coyness about the publicity which, they consider, would attach to an e.greement in political form and arc suggesting that the text should instce.d be signed by senior Service representatives of the two countries nominated for the purpose. It does not seen to us that,jlBHHHHHHHHIHHHHHi r* 3 from the British point of view, an agreement with political and financial implications of this kind can appropriately he concluded in that way quite apart from the added stability and force which would be likely to attach to an agreement in more constitutional form. I g^'ier from you, in any event, that more or less irrespective of form the agreement must be internationally registered. You will probably agree, in the circumstances, that the whole matter should be raised, attthe next stage, out of the Air Attache channel where it has been negotiated until now, 7. I have not enclosed a copy of the Annexes with this letter; they remain broadly as before but will need revision in detail when the Agreement is ready for conclusion. 8 .

A further communication will be addressed to you as soon as possible. Lord Pethick Lawrence assumes that consideration is being given to the bearing of this draft agreement on certain proposals recently made by another foreign Government and now under consideration by His Majesty's Govern- ment, the outcome of which it would seem desirable not to prejudice.

For Governor, It 1 enclose copies of letters to the Burma Office and India Office enclosing the draft of an agreement at present under discussion between His Majesty’s Government and the French Government regarding mutual transit and landing rights for military aircraft over British and French territories# I should bo grateful for your early comments on this draft so far as its proposed application to Burma is concerned. 2. You will observe that in Act. XIII it is proposed that this agreement shall remain in force for a period of 10 years and it seems probable that the Air Ministiy will attach importance to securing rights in French territory for a relatively long period of this kind* On the other hand you will probably agree that it is undesirable that the future Government of a self-governing Burma should be irrevocably committed for so long a period oven though the rights conceded to the French v/ere limited, as is proposed by Article 11(b), to such time as airfields and bases in Burma continue to bo manned and maintained by the A.A*F* While the precise meaning of Article IX as at present drafted is somewhat obscure, it would not appear that its intention is to meet a situation such as that which might* owing to constitutional changes, arise in Burma. In all the circumstances, assuming tnat you are willing that t agreement should be applicable for the time being rhe a i r fields named in Burma, I suggest that the Departments of His Majesty’s Government concerned should be asked to consider accompanying the agreement by a supplementary Note making it clear that conclusion in the present form should not be held to prejudice tap right of the Government of Burma, after that country has attained full self-government, to abrogate its application to &lt;_a.rfiolds in Burma should they so desire* 3* You may also wish to consider whether (1) in the iirst paragraph of Article VI N or such local authority as may be designated' should be inserted after 'Air Minisbyy* (2) in Article VIII the words 'the appropriate British flying control' and^ 'the appropriate British briefing instructions' should not 00 substituted for 'British flying control' and 'British briefing instructions' respectively.

Sir, I ax am directed by the Minister of Civil Aviation to refer to your letter of July 9th, C.30073/46 with which was enclosed a copy of a draft Agreement between the Govern ment of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland and the Government of the French Republic concerning flights by military aircraft over the territory of the other. 2. In reply, I am to say that Lord Winster has only one comment to offer on the draft Agreement. This is that so far as this Ministiy is concerned, he would be prepared to agree to the reciprocal waiver of landing fees when militaiy aircraft operating on the routes in question land in emergency at non-military airfields provided that:- (a) this policy is in line with the financial agree ments between the two Govemnents which are eventually concluded in accordance with the terms of Article XII of the Agreement; and (b) that the Colonial Office and the Government of India agree in so far as the airfields used are in territories for which British Colonial Governments or the Goverment of India are responsible. The Secretary of State, Air Ministry, Whitehall, London, S.W. 1.

On the 9th July a letter was received from the Air Ministry ( -&gt;age 5?) forworiing a draft Agreement between the Government of the United A.ingdoia and the Government of the French hepublic concerning flights by military aircraft over British and French territories (pages 51 to 56)* This draft has been transmitted to the French Air Ministry, without prejudice, for their acceptance in principle,prior to formal negotiation and ratification. The letter and draft agreement have been referred to iocternal Department and ourraa Office for their comments, which are at pages 59 and 6o. It will be noted that the Burma Office wish to be addressed separately by the Air Ministry in this matter. it is clear that the Government of India must be informed and asked to express their opinion on the scheme. The following are, therefore, put up for approval U* 5. 5/* (a) A draft reply to the Air Ministry. (b) A draft telegram to the Government of mdio. (c) A draft letter to the Government of India. Wit^,.reference to paragraph G in he draft mention^! in (e) above it is obv-iou 'that e future Government of India cannot at this stage be committed in advance for a term of ten years y and it is suggested that in the first instance the term should be limited to one of six months or such period as is considered desirable by the Government of India. Six months is the period for which the Government of India have agreed that Americans nay use airfields in India for transit purposes in the first instance. I have mentioned this point to Mr. Warran of the Air Ministry, who is of opinion that the French Government would not be prepared to negotiate for such a short period. 24th July, 1946.I'The Under Secretary of State for Air, Air Ministry, Adastral House, Kingsway, W.G.2.

Air Ministry, without prejudice, for their acceptance in principle prior to formal negotiation between the two Governments. The term 'British Territory' will be amended to read 'territory owned, controlled or administered by British authorities' in the agreement when finally drawn ?. The scheduled services by French Military aircraft are shown in Appendix B. 4. In Article IV a reference is made to official passengers. Since it is presumed that these officials will be non-fare paying passengers, it is suggested that a stipulation to this effect should be included in this A ».+ -? rl 1 A to stipulate that A.H.Q.(l) should be the local authority responsible for receiving notification of and giving prior permission for flights, and not the Air Ministry. effective for a term of ten years. It is thought that it im irapoisible Ft is nrmsidgrftd that, as has been proposed by the Government of India in negotiations for American air transit rights, the term should be limited in the first instance to one of six months or such period as is considered desirable.

A number of drafts of this agreement can be found throughout the file; some of these copies contain French language content. A great deal of correspondence in the file concerns airfields in territories not under direct British political control (e.g. Bahrain, Iraq, Egypt, and Sharjah), independent states (Muscat and Oman), and states becoming independent dominions of the Commonwealth (India and Pakistan). Much correspondence discusses if and how these governments should be approached for consent for French aircraft to utilise their territory: in particular, whether France should make a direct request to the Government of India for transit rights or make an application via the British Government.The file also covers proposals for the servicing of French aircraft in India by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) following the withdrawal of Royal Air Force (RAF) bases in India.The main correspondents in the file are as follows: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (William Rupert Hay), officials of the Air Ministry, officials of the Foreign Office, officials of the India Office (Commonwealth Relations Office from August 1947), and officials from the British Embassy to France.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Embassy at Paris</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Air services agreement</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commonwealth Relations Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Egypt</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>India</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military aviation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00024a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
