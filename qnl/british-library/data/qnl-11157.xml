A HANDBOOK OP MESOPOTAMIA Volume IV NOETHEim MESOPOTAMIA AND CENTEAL KURDISTAN Prepared on hehalf the W ADMIRALTY WAR STAFF INTELLIGENCE DIVISION (C.B. 296.) April, 1917NOTE Mesopotamia is treated in four volumes. The first volume contains matter of a general nature. The other volumes are devoted to the detailed description of the river and land routes. The second volume covers the regions of the Shatt el- c Arab, Karun, and Luristan, and of the Tigris and Euphrates up to Baghdad and Fellujeh. To the third volume are assigned the Tigris and Euphrates from Baghdad and Fellujeh to Mosul and Meskeneh, the Lesser Zab, the country East of the Tigris towards the Persian frontier, and the routes running westward from the Euphrates valley across the Syrian Desert. The fourth volume treats of the country North of the line joining Kowanduz, Mosul, Meskeneh, and Aleppo up to Van, Bitlis, Diarbekr, and Mar'ash. All estimates of mileage must be considered as approximate only. In most cases they are based on the rough calculations of travellers, or on the times given by travellers, or on sketch-maps or incomplete surveys. The question-marks placed beside some of the figures indicate that these are peculiarly doubtful: it is not implied that other figures may be regarded as exact. It is necessary to emphasize the fact that in the circumstances the information given cannot be complete, and that conditions are con stantly undergoing change. The Admiralty will be glad to receive corrections and additions. Maps to accompany these volumes will be issued separately.ABBEEVIATIONS In the itineraries the following abbreviations and conventional signs may be noted :— r. = right. 1. = left, h.w. = high water. l.w. = low water.

Central Kukdistan General Remarks. —The first section of land-routes given below covers the country lying E. of the line Eaniyeh—Eowanduz—Urmia —Dilman, N. of the line Eowanduz—Mosul—JezTret-ibn-'Omar, W. of the line Jezlret-ibn-'Omar—Sairt—Bitlis, and S. of the line Bitlis —Lake Yan—Lake Archag—Qotur—Dilman. This area may be divided conveniently into three parts : (i) the basin of the Great Zab river, about half of the whole area' dealt with and forming its central and SE. part; (ii) the southern section of the basins of Lakes Yan, Archag, and Urmia, forming its N. and NE. part; and (iii) the W. and SW. part, about one-third or more of the whole area. This last part includes the basins of the Bohtan Su, the Khabur Su, and some of the other tributaries of the Tigris : of all these the Bohtan Su, which joins the Tigris near Til, is by far the most important. The valleys of the Tigris between Jeziret- ibn-'Omar and Til and of the Bitlis Su are also included in this area. (i) The Zab valley area is a wild mountainous country inhabited by Nestorians and Kurds, with some Chaldeans, Armenians, and Jews. Probably the Nestorians were the most numerous before the war, but nothing definite is known on this point. The Nestorians are under the control, spiritual and civil, of their Patriarch, Mar Shimum, who resides at Kochannes. The upper part of the valley (i.e., roughly, above the junction of the Chal with the Zab), where most of the Nestorians and Kurds live, consists of rugged limestone mountains, rising to an altitude of 13,000 ft., whose general direction is E.-W., the Great Zab running through them in a N.-S. direction. Its numerous tributaries, some of which are of considerable size, have a general direction14 INTEODUCTION E.-W. All these rivers are simply mountain torrents, often running through impassable gorges: they are in high flood during the months April—June, when they are swollen by snow-water. The country is almost treeless, although there are poplars in the bottoms of some of the valleys, and junipers, oaks, walnut-trees, and others are found occasionally. It is unfertile, and the hillsides are so steep that most of the cultivation is terraced. There is a fair amount of grazing for sheep and goats, and in the late spring or early summer, when the snow has melted, nomad Kurds as well as the local inhabi tants bring their flocks to the y or summer grazing-grounds, for three or four months: most of the grass on these grazing grounds dries up about the end of August. The crops produced consist of rice, wheat, barley, millets, tobacco, &amp;c., and there are numerous small vineyards and fruit orchards: but the area suitable for cultivation is so small that the soil produces little more than is required for local consumption. The country, as indicated already, is well watered by numerous streams. The winter is severe, with a heavy snowfall: one result of this is that many of the passes and higher roads are closed by snow for several months each year, while snow-avalanches render some of the lower roads unsafe during the spring. In summer the heat is considerable, but it is not so great as to interfere with the movements of travellers. The middle part of the Zab basin (i.e. between the Chal junction and the point where the river enters the plain of the Tigris), sparsely inhabited by Chaldeans and Yezidis with some Kurds, Nestorians, Jews and others, consists largely of sandstone hills, rising to altitudes of 8,000 or 9,000 ft., which are fairly well wooded with oaks, haw thorns, &amp;c. It is a fertile country, fairly well watered, which could support a large population if it were not exposed to raids from the Kurds who live in the hills to the N. To the S. and SW. these hills fall away in lower ranges to the undulating plain of Mosul. (ii; In the basins of Lakes Urmia, Archag, and Van, the hills are considerably lower than those of the Upper Zab valley, few rising to a greater altitude than 8,000 ft. The hill-country has hardly any natural vegetation except grass, of which there is a certain amount in the highest areas. The plain of Urmia is extremely well culti vated, producing rice, cotton, tobacco, &amp;c. A considerable part of it, together with smaller plains in the neighbourhood, is marshy. The country as a whole is fairly well populated by Armenians, Kurds, and Nestorians (in the plain of Urmia), with a few Jews, almost all agriculturists. The Christian population has recently been much reduced by massacre (p. 32). (iii) This part of Central Kurdistan is separated from (i), theINTEODUCTION 15 innui B E. and SE. part, by a great chain of mountains, rising to altitudes of 11,000 and 12,000 ft., which forms the western rim of the Zab basin. The From this divide the hills descend in ranges decreasing in altitude towards the Tigris, following either the Bohtan Su to the W., or others the KhabQr Su, the Hazil Su, or the Koshur Su to the S. To the )S fep south of the Khabur basin lies the Mosul plain. Most of the higher of country is uninhabited, except in the vicinity of the Bohtan Su and of the lower reaches of some of its tributaries. Most of the rivers, nhahi. for a considerable part of their course, run through impenetrable ^8, gorges. The higher hills consist chiefly of down-like country, razing excellent grazing grounds {sozari much used by nomad Kurds duced during the summer. The snowfall is considerable in these hills, re are The lower slopes and bottoms of most of the valleys are well wooded, liable Certain areas of the lower country are fairly well populated. Water bnis is plentiful. eady, General Description of Routes. —It appears that through com- wlth mercial caravan-traffic from the Tigris valley to Van and the north, so 3 and far as it has touched this region at all, has only skirted its west side by while the Jezlret-ibn-'Omar—Sairt—Bitlis route, or has followed its eastern g the border by the Mosul—Eaniyeh—Urmia route into north-west Persia, jatas This fact is probably due partly to the predatory habits of the Kurds, but more to the natural obstacles of the route, such as the high passesj ction the numerous rivers and streams which have to be crossed, and the ,i'sely severe snowstorms which are frequent throughout the winter. The •lans, rivers and streams are not bridged as a rule ; although some have iudes rough wooden bridges, often carried away by floods, or wicker haw- suspension bridges of little use except to pedestrians. A very few jould of the minor streams have stone bridges. In many places the tracks i the follow ledges cut in the sides of rocky gorges, or along precipices; hills while in others spurs jutting into rivers are crossed by or staircases, some of the steps being cut out of the rock while others 3 are are built up : the roads in many places are so narrow that laden g to mules cannot pass along them. In other places the tracks simply any follow the beds of streams, and are so rough as to be almost Hint impassable for laden animals. In other places the roads run in zig- ulti- zags, which, however, are not properly graded. In fact the so-called if it, roads, with a few rare exceptions, are simply tracks such as a rude. The uncivilized people might be expected to make use of for local com- and munications in a mountainous country. It is probable that in a short : all time a pioneer regiment could improve some of them sufficiently to iuch allow mule batterie- and pack transport to traverse the country. In most cases, therefore, the routes given consist of a con- the nected series of local tracks, and few of them are really through16 INTEODUCTION routes: there are many alternative tracks and connecting branches, some of which are described. Nothing is known of any improve ments which may have been made in these routes since the war began; possibly a good deal of road-making has been carried out I along the Persian frontier and in the neighbourhood of Lake Van, of ' Sairt, Bitlis, and Jezlret-ibn-'Omar. Of the principal lines of communication four run from N. to S., viz. (a) Kaniyeh or Eowanduz to Urmia; (&amp;) Mosul to Van Amadiyeh and Bash Qalah ; (c) Jezlret-ibn-'Omar to Van via Shat- takh ; and {d) J eziret-ibn-'Omar to Bitlis Sairt; while one runs from E. to W. from Urmia via Van to Bitlis, (a) Baniyeh or Rowandus to Urmia. 1 —'From. Eaniyeh to Urmia runs the route by the Wazneh Pass, El-Watan, and through the Lahjan and Urmia plains by Chianeh 60 a), which has been pionounced to be the best line for a military road or railway from Mesopotamia to north-west Persia. Before the war, however, it was not passable throughout for wheels: it was steep and difficult in places in the hills, and marshy in parts of the plains: and recent repoits indicate that the Wazneh Pass is more difficult than the Gaiau Shinkeh Pass on the Eowanduz—Suj Bulaq road (see below). The passes are blocked with snow in winter, and the Shulduz Chai, Lesser Zab, and N is tan Su are unfordable when in flood. An alter native route to El-Watan goes by Ser Desht (see vol. hi, 41, and this volume, Houte 60 b), but this is nearly twice as long as the route by the Wazneh Eass and does not seem to be a better road. Other variants are provided by cross-tracks between these two routes to El-Watan. Erom Chianeh, about 62 m. beyond El-Watan, an alternative route to Urmia branches off, leading by Ushru, from which point onwards it may be passable for guns: but there is no recent information on the subject (see 60 c). From Eowanduz to Urmia a route leads by Neri and Dlzeh, It follows the western slopes of the divide between Lake Urmia and the Great Zab to Dlzeh. Thus far it is an extremely bad track through sparsely populated, rugged mountains, with fair grazing, poor fuel-supply, and plenty of water. From Dlzeh the route by Bazirgeh is good, being capable of use by light vehicles. This part of the loute is used by traders, and forms part of a fairly frequented trade route between Urmia and Bash Qal'ah on the Great Zab. It crosses the watershed between the Zab and Lake Urmia by a fairly easy pass (see Route 61a). A much more difficult route leads from Dlzeh to Urmia through the Marbishu District (see Route 61 b). Th© routes fioni Mosul to Raniyeh cind Rowanduz are given in vol. iii.INTEODUCTION 17 Mes Another route from Eowanduz to Urmia leads over the Kelishin Pass to Ushnu, and thence follows the Ushnu—Urmia road men- e le ft tioned above {Route 60 c). This, as far as the southern foot of the 'nedon Kelishin Pass, seems to be an easy mule-track, but the pass itself is keVan,): difficult (see Boute 61 c). A third route is that which follows the Kowanduz—Suj Bulaq road Jf.toi [Route 61 d) by Rayat and the Garau Shinkeh Pass into the Lahjan ' ™ « P lail \ where it strikes the Eaniyeh—Urmia road {Route 60 a) near fifl Slul Kaplisan. A great deal of work would be necessary to make the ie(c)nii. route from Rowanduz to Kaplisan passable throughout for wheels, and the passes are blocked with snow in winter. On the other hand,' to Uri the Garau Shinkeh Pass was reported, by the Boundary Commission 'ougliif of 1914, to be the easiest between Qasr-i-Shlrln and Ararat, has ki {ty Mosul to Van viaAmadiyeh Qal'ah. —This route crosses wayftoi the Tigris plain to Amadiyeh, enters and ascends the basin of the er.iiis Great Zab, and then crosses a pass into the watershed of Lake Van. ifficulti It appears not to be used as a through route, traders going from Van id red to the Tigris valley via Bitlis. But from Mosul to Amadiyeh it thanfc, carries a good deal of traffic; as it does from Bash Qal'ah to Van. ebekj S uc h trade as there is between Amadiyeh and Bash Qal'ah must luz Ctsj follow it, however, and travellers going from the plains in the N. or in alto' the S. to visit the Nestorian Patriarch at Kochannes, some distance ?41, aii 1 Bash Qal'ah, generally use it. Throughout neai'ly its whole heroi length there are two or more tracks, some of which are used Otte onl y 3 n the winter, others only in the summer, while others have outesb certain advantages or disadvantages concerning which particulars ;taD, at ^ re g ive n in the detailed descriptions of the routes. From Mosul to 'j, froii Amadiyeh, and again from Bash Qal'ah to Van, one of the roads re is® described is passable for light vehicles, at all events for the greater part of the distances traversed. The rest of the route is extremely ;eh. I bad, and is crossed by numerous streams almost impassable in times of uia and tlood ; it is available for^ lightly laden mules only. Except in the i track nei ghbourhood of Amadiyeh there is not sufficient fuel for any razing, considerable body of men, and the grazing is poor. Throughout ute by ^ -here is^ plenty of water, and a considerable number of sheep could s part be obtained: the country is poor and little grain can be had.

(cj Jeziret -ihn- Omar to Van via This route leads NE. ... across the hills forming the divide between the Tigris valley and the MES. IV B18 INTRODUCTION upper waters of the Bohtan Su. It crosses the latter stream near Shattakh and then crosses the northern watershed of the Bohtan Su into the basin of Lake Van. It is not used for through trade, nor indeed is there any trade along it except between Shattakh and Van. The rest, the southern part, is followed by the numerous flocks which go to the high lands S. of the Bohtan Su for summer grazing. This part goes through an almost uninhabited country, consisting chiefly of grass-covered hills of no great altitude, although they are under snow for three or four months in the year. The country is well watered, but produces little fuel and practically no grain. North of Shattakh its character changes, the valleys being well wooded and the population fairly dense for a mountainous tract. There are alternative tracks on certain stretches of the main route, e.g. one from Maidan Jasus to Van, via Shiv Shall! and Marwanen 82 and part of 79) and another from Shattakh to Van Vostan {Boute 81 b), but these are not so numerous as in the Great Zab valley. A considerable part of the road N. of Shattakh was passable for light vehicles some years ago, and the greater part of it between Shattakh and JezIret-ibn-'Omar either is passable for such vehicles, or could easily be made so. But immediately S. of Shattakh a stretch of some miles passes over such difficult ground that it would be extremely hard to grade it for vehicles. See 80 and 81 a. [d)Jemret-ihn-'Omar—Sairt—Bitlis. —(The routes between Mosul and Jezlret-ibn-'Omar are discussed below, p. 24.) The route from Jezlret-ibn-'Omar to Sairt before the war was a mule-track, apparently difficult in places, though perhaps easier than is suggested by the detailed report of 1888 given in this volume. As far as Til the road follows the general line of the Tigris valley on its eastern side, but does not throughout keep to the immediate vicinity of the river. Beyond Til the Bohtan valley is followed. The Bohtan Su would prove a serious obstacle, except at l.w. season, unless its bridge has been repaired. From Sairt the main route proceeds to Ziyaret Wa'iz el-Qur'ani (or simply Ziyaret) making a detour to W. The Sairt— Ziyaret road is perhaps passable for guns. From Ziyaret to Bitlis the line for a chaussee has been laid for 30 years, but it is doubtful whether the chaussee had been completed at the outbreak of the war. On this route from Jezlret-ibn-'Omar to Bitlis water is generally plentiful, but at Sairt the supply is sometimes deficient and not of good quality (see JRoute 85). An alternative route from Sairt to Bitlis goes by Chemi Khan, east of, and more direct than, the road by Ziyaret. It joins the Ziyaret— Bitlis chaussee near Dukhan. It apparently could be easily im proved so as to make it fit for guns 86 a). The Keser Su hasINTRODUCTION 19 '®iiw to be forded, but this could be avoided by following a track which 0 anSi goes somewhat W. of the Chenxi Khan road, and crosses the Keser Me ii by the Argif Bridge ; it joins the road by Chemi Khan not far from ' f 1 | Dukhan (see Route 86 b). Lastly, a track, difficult even for pack- ■ animals, leads from Sairt to Bitlis farther east than the road by l 5' « Chemi Khan : it passes Kifra and Olek (see Route 86 c). (e) Urmia to Yan and Bitlis. —There are two routes from Urmia to are ui Van. One of these goes to Dizeh by 61 a, b, thence to Bash Qal'ah ryism! by Houte 65, and from that town to Van by Jtoutc. 74a. The greater Noil part of this could probably be used by light vehicles; but there are 'ooWi two impassable stretches; one of about 12 miles before the Great Tke t Zab is crossed (see Route 65, m. 15^), and the other of a few miles e, eg i at the Chukh Gedik [Route 74 a, m. 14). This road has the dis- advantage of being more or less closed by snow to all considerable riaWi traffic for several months, at the Chukh Gedik and on the Gavvar GreatZi plain some miles E. of the bad stretch at m. ISf of 65 : other- aspassi wise it forms a good route for a mountainous country. The other itbetm route to Bitlis passes by Dilman, Khoi, and Lake Archag to Van ihelii (see Routes 66 a and 76 a). This is a driving road practically the hasbti whole way: the only part which presents any serious difficulty for 1 would I regular vehicular traffic is a stretch of two or three miles at the pass 1( 18l3, beyond Eazi [Route 76 a, m. 69). This road is fairly free from snow, gen lb and plenty of water and grazing are to be had along it, together with route h some fuel. There is an alternative track from Razi to Van appareil 76 b) across the Chul Chemen and Ermanis plains: an easy track, tedljl perhaps passable for light vehicles. From Van to Bitlis (see llthei 89 a) the road follows the south shore of Lake Van. Some short D aide,I stretches of it were open for wheeled traffic according to the latest the rid information available: it is possible, however, that since the war gufoili began the whole road has been graded and made passable throughout bridgei 6 ^ or vehicles. This road passes through a populous, well-wooded, rSretW 1 well-watered country, with fairly good grazing. 'lie gait- Lateral communications. —There are many branch routes, some jttoltf connecting the main lines of communication referred to above, and s doui others forming alternative routes on the main lines. Most of these are jfthe# extre mely bad, some being impassable for laden animals, while some geuefll a ie closed by snow in winter, and some by snow avalanches in the s l )r ! n g- The following are the most important of these lateral routes which connect two main lines of communication :— rJH Connecting [a) with [h). (1) Amadiyeh to Eowanduz [Route 2iyai«t' ,)J a); -From this a very rough track branches to Oramar 62 b), jasilj'® through a wild, sparsely inhabited country. (2) Neri to serSw Cannes [Route 63 a). A track similar to the Oramar route just b 220 INTKODUCTION described, and passing through similar country. (3) Dizeh to Kochannes [Route 64), A rough track, sometimes used by travellers going from Lake Urmia to Julamerk and Kochannes. (ii) Connecting (6) with (e). (4) Amadiyeh to Zakho and thence to Jezlret-ibn-'Omar. This also connects Amadiyeh with the Mosul Jezlret-ibn-'Omar route via Zakho. It is an easy hill-track (see Route 90 c). (5) Amadiyeh to Van 79), the Khabur Su and the Bohtan Su. A better track than the last, and perhaps of some importance as forming the shortest route from Mosul to the upper waters of the Bohtan Su. A track, on the character of which no information was available, leads from MargI at m. 51f to Sher- nakh [Route 80, m. 31-|). From Marwanen at m. 130, 83 leads to Shattakh [Route 80, m. 103) over country which may be of some military importance, about the upper waters of the Bohtan Su. It is an easy track for mules. (6) Julamerk to Kochannes and on to Van across the upper waters of the Bohtan Su, where it meets the preceding road [Routes 70 and 72). This is a fairly good mule road and forms the shortest route between an important part of the Zab valley and Van. It is closed by snow during the winter. (7) Bash Qal'ah to Dilman [Route 75) via Nerzingi: a local trade route of some importance. From Nerzingi Boute 77 leads across the hills and the Chul Chemen plain to Serai. (8) Bash Qal'ah to Sekunis, on (5) above [Boute 73). (9) Khoshab to Serai 78) across the Chul Chemen plain ; an easy road over a country where large bodies of troops might be manoeuvred. (iii) Connecting (c) with [d). (10) Bitlis to Mukus 88), an easy mule-track which might be of importance if Bitlis were a centre of operations. (11) Shernakh Gedik (on the Jezlret-ibn-'Omar— Shattakh road, JRoute 80) to Sairt [R 84). This is the only route described which leads across the considerable area lying S. of the Harakol Dagh and between the Tigris and the Koshur Su. (iv) Connecting [d] with (e). (12) Sairt to Van, without going through Bitlis [Boutes 87 a, b). This is a fairly good mule-path, some times used by traders. Northern Mesopotamia and the Plain of Diaebekr General Remarks.- —(a) The Plain Jeztreh. —North of a line drawn from Mosul to Meskeneh through the Sinjar Hills, there stretches between the Tigris and the Euphrates a belt of plain some 60 to 80 miles from S. to N., and about 250 miles from E. to W. On the north this plain is bounded E. of Mardln by the Tur Abdin plateau, and W. of Mardln by the stony hill-country thatINTEODU OTION 21 ^ I has its centre in the Qarajeh Dagh. Near the Tigris the plain is fWellj undulating, with a certain amount of broken ground: north of the Sinjar Hills it is very flat: west of the Jaghjagha river it is dtlwl undulating again and sometimes rises in low hill-ridges. To the le Mosul- east of the Jaghjagha the plain is empty of settled inhabitants •track (t except near its borders: west of that river it contains villages in MtS some districts along its northern side and in the country E. of peAapsi Jerablus: elsewhere they are infrequent, small, and unimportant. Mill to II The plain as a whole is not naturally unfertile, and with a strong n 1 of fit government and a good irrigation system agriculture might be .| to In revived over a great part of it. At present, however, cultivation \ Mi exists only near its edges, or, in the interior of its western part, mayki on the perennial streams (the Khabur and Belikh), and here and BoliW there in better-watered areas, such as the valley of Migteleh, E. of s anil oil Jerablus. On the whole cultivation seems to have been on the meetsl increase in the western part of northern Jezlreh during the years mule in preceding the war, and there is no clear information as to its present oftkl extent. Part of this cultivation is the work of semi-nomads. (7)1 The surface of this country does not present much difficulty to ute of* movement. There are a good many wadis and stream-beds, and Usanill there are patches of marshy ground, but generally the terrain is easy n i S) ojj and open. The difficulties, as in the southern JezTreh, arise chiefly s {1)0 (Hi from the lack of water and supplies. Supplies are apparently either e yiffli altogether lacking or very scanty except in the districts of Mardln, Urfeh, Seruj, and Migteleh, E. of Jerablus. The most favourable }}( f ( §S;: time for movement across the plains is the spring, for though the jreatei' going may then be heavy owing to rain, there is much good grazing, and the water-supply is at its best. In summer water is, in general, onlvnt very scarce ; most of the streams dry up either altogether or in their ^ gj[| lower courses; the grass is burnt up ; and the nomads for the most part move towards the hills or the few perennial rivers. Along the ' j gj foot of the northern hills there is apparently a better water-supply between Jeziret-ibn-'Omar and Mardln than between Mardln and Urfeh. The plain of Nisibin, especially, is well watered by the Jaghjagha and its affluents. From Mardln to Urfeh water is very scarce except in the neighbourhood of Veiran Shehr and in that of Urfeh itself. Between Urfeh and the Euphrates is the fertile i district of Seruj. The interior of the plain is on the whole better , jj| watered in its western than in its eastern part. The Jaghjagha, the H* , ji Khabur, and the Belikh are perennial rivers. Fuel is very scarce, f F: as there is practically no timber throughout the plain. \ $ ip) TheTur Ahdin. —The northern border of the plain between 1 1 Jeziret-ibn-'Omar and Mardln is very sharply marked by the abrupt22 INTRODUCTION southern edge of the Tur Ahdin plateau. This plateau is bounded on the E. and N. by the Tigris, and on the W. by the hill-country which rises towards the Qarajeh Dagh. The summit of the Tur Abdin is a mass of low rocky ridges, mostly basaltic, covered with patches of low oaks and undergrowth, with a fertile soil beneath the stones. Most of the ravines are dry for the greater part of the year, and water, which is very scarce in summer, is derived chiefly from wells and cisterns. The eastern part of the plateau is more intricate and difficult than that near Diarbekr, where the country becomes less stony-and more undulating, with some fertile valleys containing streams. The Tur Abdin has a fair number of villages, largely inhabited by Jacobite Christians. Along the western side of the Tur Abdin, between it and the spurs of the Mazi Dagh and Qarajeh Dagh, there is a fairly easy line, along valleys running S. and N., and over low cols. This line connects the great Mesopotamian plain with the plain of Diarbekr. Diarbekr stands at the northern end of this line and Mardln at the southern. (c) The Qarajeh Dagh and neighbourhood. —North-west of Mardln are the Mazi Dagh and the larger and more important Qarajeh Dagh, with their rocky spurs and outliers, forming a hill-country which is very broken and difficult, crossed by tracks which are few and bad and not well supplied 'vith water. There is practically no settled population in the interior of this country. The long spurs and out liers of the hill-country run down into the plain between Mardln and Veiran Shehr, and between Veiran Shehr and Urfeh in rocky ridges where water is scarce. Some low ridges also come down to the west of Urfeh, but beyond them to Birijik, and from Birijik NW. to Severek, an undulating open plain intervenes between the Qarajeh Dagh country and the Euphrates. North of the Qarajeh Dagh its spurs run out to connect with a belt of stony ridges and plateaux between the Euphrates and the plain of Diarbekr. Over these northern spurs of the Qarajeh Dagh there is easy communication between Diarbekr and Severek. (d) The Plain of JDlarhckr and neigh —To the north, north-west, north-east and east of Diarbekr extends an open, rolling, and in parts fairly well cultivated plain. On the west this plain is bounded by the low stony hill-country bordering the Euphrates, already mentioned. On the north-west it stretches up to the mountains of the Eastern Taurus in the neighbourhood of the Arghaneh defile—the main approach to Diarbekr and Mesopotamia from western Armenia and Anatolia. On the north the plain is bounded by a belt of low rocky ridges, beyond which rise the centralINTRODUCTION 23 ranges of the Eastern Taurus, here forming a very difficult barrier. On the north-east the plain runs up to the ridges called the Hajertum and Sheikh Dodanli, outliers of the Taurus, lying north-east of the lower Batman Su. On the east it stretches in easy undulations to the Desht-i-Keri and the Ashita Dagh, south and south-west of the lower Batman. Between the Ashita Dagh on the south, and the Eastern Taurus on the north is a country of rolling plains and open hills, which gives access to the region of Zokh and beyond to Ziyaret, Til and Sairt, thus affording connexion with the Jezlret-ibn- 'Omar—Bitlis line of communication dealt with above. The plain of Diarbekr and the open country east of it is generally easy to traverse and is crossed by some comparatively good roads. The soil which is largely clay and gravel may make heavy going after rain. The chief obstacles are the larger rivers, the Tigris and its principal tributaries. The latter, however, are generally fordable except in the flood season. Water is on the whole plentiful. Though not cultivated in propor tion to the fertility of its soil, the plain contains a fair number of villages and a few small towns. General Description of Routes. —The configuration of northern Jezlreh and the plain of Diarbekr described above has the following general results in the direction of the main lines of communica tion :— (а) Caravan traffic going east and west across this part of Mesopo tamia (from the neighbourhood of Mosul towards Aleppo) has long been compelled, by the lack of water and supplies and also by the general insecurity which prevails in the plains of northern Jezlreh, to make a dotour to the north either along the foot of the hills (Nisibin—Mardln—Urfeh), or more commonly round by Diarbekr to the north of the Qarajeh Dagh, through Severek, and thence by Urfeh or Hovek to the Euphrates. This way by Diarbekr, though the longer, is easier for wheeled vehicles, and on the whole is better furnished with supplies and water than the direct Mardln Urfeh road. The railway, however, now affords a line of communication from Jerablus on the Euphrates passing south of Urfeh to Ras el- Ain in the interior of the plain. From Ras el-'Ain it runs to Tel Ermen, and was planned to go to Nisibin and thence direct to Mosul by Tel Rumelan, thus cutting off the corner of what was before the war the more usual caravan route from Nisibin to Mosul, that by Jezlret-ibn- 'Omar or Feishkhabur. (But see next paragraph and p. 417.) (б) For communication between the Mesopotamian plain and Armenia or the Kharput—Sivas region, Diarbekr is by far the most important nodal point. Here converge the principal roads from the24 INTRODUCTION passes of the Eastern Taurus on the north, north-west and north-east ; from the south-west comes the road from Birijik by Severek: from the south the road from Mardln across the depression between the Tur Abdin on the east and the Qarajeh Dagh country on the west: in 1916 the Turks were reported to be intending to construct a rail way from Eas el-'Ain to Diarbekr by Mardln, a work which, it was said, was to take precedence of the extension of the line to Nisibin and Mosul. From the south-east there are tracks across the Tur Abdin from Jezlret-ibn-'Omar. Lastly, the Tigris below Diarbekr can be used for downstream raft-navigation. Above Jezlret-ibn-'Omar that river is bridged only at Diarbekr. The principal route to the north avoiding Diarbekr is that from Jezlret-ibn-'Omar to Sairt and thence to Bitlis ; but even this before the war seems to have been as far as Sairt only a rather difficult mule-track. The few other routes to the north which do not pass through Diarbekr (such as the Mardin— Bismll—Farqln line and the Severek—Chermuk—Arghana road) seem to have been of minor importance. Routes hetween Mosul andDiarhehr. — The Tigris, between Diarbekr and Mosul, flows through a number of deep and narrow gorges, and the swiftness of the current and the rapids formed by rocks and gravel banks appear to make it impracticable for upstream navigation. But there is a good deal of downstream raft traffic on this part of the river (see III Gr). The most usual line for caravan traffic from Mosul to Diarbekr before the war seems to have been that by Jezlret-ibn-'Omar, Nisibin, and Mardln. Jezlret-ibn-'Omar can be reached from Mosul by a number of routes. The country to the east of the Tigris is for the most part easily undulating and well watered, and contains a fair number of Moslem, Christian, and Yezidi villages. The immediate neighbour hood of the 1. bank of the Tigris between Mosul and Feishkhabur is too broken to admit of easy movement, and therefore the river valley in this region is avoided by traffic. The principal obstacles en countered are the line of the Jebel Abyadh and the Khabur river, a large tributary of the Tigris. A dilapidated led before the war to the top of the pass over the Jebel Abyadh above Zakho, but the northern side of the pass seems to have been impracticable for wheels. At Zakho the Khabur is bridged, and hence a road leads to Jeziret-ibn-'Omar along the north side of the Khabur and then by the 1. bank of the Tigris. This, though practicable for carts, is difficult in spring or after rain owing to the number of streams to be crossed. The Jebel Abyadh can be turned at its western end by a route pass ing through or near Feishkhabur, whence either the Zakho bridgeIS INTRODUCTION 25 can be reached, or in summer and autumn the Khabur can be forded at one of several practicable places between Zakho and its mouth : or again the Tigris can be crossed at Feishkhabur(where there was a ferry before the war) and JezIret-ibn-'Omar can be reached by easy country along the r. bank of that river (see 90 a, b, c). From Jezlret-ibn-'Omar to Nisibin there are two roads over the plain below the Tur Abdin. These, some years ago, were not throughout passable for wheels, but were generally easy for baggage animals, though the southern route was liable to become difficult in winter owing to mud. Both routes are well supplied with water. There are a number of small Christian and Kurdish villages in the neighbourhood (see Boutes 93 a, b). Nisibin can also be reached by a direct route from Feishkhabur over a rolling plain fairly well supplied with water (see 90 d). Again, caravans used sometimes to go direct from Mosul to Nisibin by Tel Rumelan, passing over undulating country, most of which is uninhabited. The surface here is fairly easy for wheeled traffic, but water is scarce, especially in summer and autumn. In spring there is abundant grazing here. This is the line which has been planned for the railway between Nisibin and Mosul. It is not known what may have been recently done to make it more easily passable for troops (see Eoute 91 and appendices). But it appears that in January 1916 the Turks were using a line of march from Eas el-Ain via Tel Ermen, Amudeh to Nisibin, and thence to Mosul direct (see Boutes 126, introduction; 94, m. 17, and 91, Appendix 4). The march from Eas el-Ain to Nisibin was stated to occupy 4 days, and that from Nisibin to Mosul 9 days (or according to another report 15 days for the whole). It was anticipated that from July onward a route from Eas el-Ain via Tel Ermen to Jezlret-ibn-'Omar, and thence to Mosul, would be used, as it is better watered. Lastly a circuitous way from Mosul to Nisibin is by Tel A'far and thence along either the north or the south side of the Sinjar Hills to the neighbourhood of the Shillo Pass, whence Nisibin can be reached by desert tracks over flat country, soft in wet weather, with a poor water-supply (see Boutes 92 a, b). From Nisibin to Mar din there is a carriage-road easy in dry weather but soft after rain, running along the foot of the Tur Abdin. It is not very well supplied with water (see 94). From Mardln to Diarbekr there was a partially metalled road which was described before the war as passable for carts, but only in dry weather for carriages. It leads along valleys between the Tur Abdin and the Mazi Dagh and crosses some low stony hills. Water is rather scarce on parts of the way (see 95 a). An alternative26 INTRODUCTION route goes W. of the main road by Avineh and Qirq across the NW, course of the Tur Abdin : it is rough and difficult in parts and is not practicable for wheels. Near Qirq it connects with Bismll on the other side of the Tigris, on the road from Diarbekr to Sairt (see Boute 95 b). A third route from Mardln to Diarbekr is by Derek on one of the Mardln—Veiran Shehr roads, whence it goes N. over the Mazi Dagh, E. of the main road : but beyond Derek it seems to be only a rough and difficult hill-track (see 95 c). A further detour to the east would be by a track which runs between the Qarajeh Dagh and the Mazi Dagh. This is said to be passable over most of its length for carts and light artillery (see 117 a). A secondary line from JezTret-ibn-'Omar to Diarbekr runs across the Tur Abdin plateau by Midiat: but this is not practicable for wheels throughout and lies over rather difficult country with little water (see Boutes 96 a and b, 101). Tracks for pack-animals con nect Nisibin with Midiat (see Boutes 97 a, b, c). An easier road than these (but not for most of its length passable for wheels) leads to Midiat from Mardln (see Route 98 a). A road which is at best only just passable for carts runs from Midiat to Hasan Kaif on the Tigris (see Boute 99). A route for pack-animals, difficult in places, runs from Mardln to Hasan Kaif, passing W. of Midiat, and crossing the Midiat—Diarbekr road (see Route 100). Midiat is connected by an easy track with Challek ferry in the Tigris valley, on the Jezlret-ibn-'Omar—Sairt road. Diarbekr might also be reached from Jezlret-ibn-'Omar by ascend ing the Tigris valley to Til or to Sairt (see p. 23) and thence following one of the roads between Diarbekr and Sairt referred to below. Main Routes leading toDicirbekr from —The chief entrance to the plain of Diarbekr from the north-west is the Arghana defile, through which runs the great from Sivas and Khar- put to Diarbekr. For an account of this route between the Arghana defile and Diarbekr see Route 109. This can be turned on the west by a pass leading over the hills west of Arghana by Pusherto, to which fairly easy tracks (apparently not passable for wheels) run from Chermuk and Arghana, and a more difficult one from Chunkush. Chermuk is connected by roads with Severek (see Boutes 111a andb: rather difficult), Diarbekr (see 110: easy), Arghana (fairly easy), and Chunkush (fair). An account of the passes over the Eastern Taurus between the Arghana defile and the Bitlis Pass will be found on p. 322. None was passable for all arms before the present war. But in 1916 it was reported that a road between Diarbekr and Mush by Hazro was under construction. Of the other routes over this part of theINTRODUCTION 27 Eastern Taurus the easiest seems to be the col over the Ziyaret Dagh N, of Lijjeh across which runs a route used by mule-caravans in summer going between Diarbekr and Erzerum. For an account of the road between Diarbekr and Lijjeh see 104. Lijjeh is also connected with Farqln and the Batman Bridge by a fair road {Boutes 105,106). Mule-tracks also run from Diarbekr to Plran and Haini west of Lijjeh, from which paths over the hills can be reached (see Boutes 108, 107). A number of roads passable for wheels, running over plains or rolling downs, connect Diarbekr with Sairt and Ziyaret, and thus with the Bitlis Gorge, the main approach to Mesopotamia from the NE. The roads between Bitlis and Sairt or Ziyaret are discussed on p. 18. The Diarbekr—Sairt road bifurcates near Ermi, one branch going by Ridhwan and the Nasr ed-Dln Koprii, the other leading north of the Bekhan Dagh by Hop. Both were before the war passable for wheels though some improvement was needed here and there. The road by the Nasr ed-Dln Kopru seems to have been somewhat the easier. It was connected with Til by a branch from Ridhwan. Before the war the only practicable bridge on these routes was that called the Nasr ed-Dln over the Bitlis Su. The Batman, the Hazo, the Bitlis, and the Keser Su are the principal streams crossed. These can be forded with ease in low water, but are impassable in flood- time. The limits of the flood season vary from year to year : but as a general rule the rivers are in flood from March to the end of June ; the Batman remains high after the others—perhaps till the middle of July. The streams other than those mentioned above are insignifi cant except after heavy rains (see 102 a, b). The principal route from Diarbekr to Zokh and Ziyaret and thence to Bitlis is that which runs by Parqln and the great bridge over the Batman (the Batman Kopru). Along this line the Diarbekr—Bitlis chaussee has been laid. The road is easily passable for wheels. Of the unbridged streams which are crossed the chief obstacle is the Hazo Su. Another road to Zokh follows the Diarbekr—Sairt road to Ermi, and there diverges NE., crossing the Desht-i-Keri. It is passable for all arms, and is shorter than the route by the Batman KOprti; but by this way it is necessary to ford the Batman as well as the Hazo (see Routes 103 a, b). Routes between the lineDiarbehr—Mardln —The principal road between Diarbekr and the Euphrates is that which passes north and west of the Qarajeh Dagh by Severek and Hovek to Birijik. The country traversed is generally level or easily undulating, except among the northern spurs of the Qarajeh Dagh. The road is i Ji passable for wheels though not good after heavy rains. Between28 INTRODUCTION Diarbekr and Severek there was before the war a in poor repair. Water is plentiful on some stages, scarce in others. Grazing is good in spring: supplies are fairly plentiful in normal times (see Boute 113). Between Severek and Birijik wheeled traffic seems generally to have preferred a detour by Urfeh to the more direct road by Hovek. This detour followed Boute 120 a and 123 a or b. It is about 6 hours longer than the way via Hovek. Prom Severek a track, apparently fairly easy, leads NW. to G-erger on the farther side of the Euphrates valley (see Route 114), and from Mishmishln near Severek, on the road between that place and Hovek, a route runs into the Euphrates valley, which it descends, passing Samsat on the opposite bank to Rum QaFah ferry. This route runs over easy undulating country with a good deal of cultivation (see 115). The Urfeh —Samsat route crosses the Severek—Hovek high road at a point a few miles from Hovek. From Hovek an easy track passable for carriages leads to the Euphrates at Kilik, whence it continues as a mule-road to Behisni. Prom Mardln the direct route to.the Euphrates leads by Veiran Shehr and Urfeh to Birijik, but, as has been already mentioned, the country as far as Urfeh is broken and difficult in places, and water is not on the whole plentiful. Between Mardln and Veiran Shehr there are two main routes, a northern by Derek, a southern by Tel Ermen and Meshquq. The former is generally rough and stony till the plain of Veiran Shehr is reached, and is apparently impassable for wheels without improvement. Water is scarce (see 116 a). The southern route traverses much more easy country except in the neighbourhood of Mardln, but water is scarce except in spring and early summer. The heat in summer is very great (see 116 b). A variant of this route generally used in summer takes a rather more northerly line to Meshquq (see Route 116 c). Between Veiran Shehr and Urfeh is a waterless limestone region, which before the war was considered passable for two-wheeled carts and guns, but not for four-wheeled vehicles. A number of difficult ravines are crossed between Veiran Shehr and the low hills called Tektek Dagh, in which is the worst part of the route. Water is very scarce in summer. Grazing is good, at least in spring. Urfeh lies in a cultivated plain where villages are fairly numerous (see Route 118). Prom Urfeh to Birijik there are three routes: (i) the longest and most southerly runs S. along the E. side of the Nimrud Dagh, skirts the Seruj Dagh and then runs NW. across the plain to Birijik ; this is apparently easier than the second route, but nothing is known17 INTRODUCTION 29 of it in detail: (ii) via Seruj, over an undulating plain, passable for wheels though muddy, in winter ; there are numerous villages in this district; water is fairly plentiful: (iii) Char Melik, a shorter route to north of the second, fairly easy in dry weather, but in places heavy after rain: for the first third of the way from Urfeh there is a good metalled chaussee ; water is scarce and supplies are lacking as far as Char Melik ; but beyond that place there is a good deal of cultivation, and water is more plentiful (see 123 a and b). Between the lines Diarbekr—Severek—Birijikand Mardin—Veiran Shehr—Urfeh—Birijik, lateral communication is largely obstructed by the difficulties of the Qarajeh Dagh country. From Veiran Shehr to Diarbekr the easiest cross-country track seems to be that already men tioned (p. 22), running up the depression between the Mazi Dagh and the Qarajeh Dagh, which may be passable for light wheeled -vehicles {Route 117 a). For other hill tracks see 117 b and c. Between Yeiran Shehr and Severek there seems to be no direct route in com mon use : for some account of a cross-country journey here see 119. From Urfeh to Severek the best route is that which strikes the high road between Severek and Hovek at Qara Jiiren (Jurneresh): it is passable for wheels. A rougher track through country badly sup plied with water leads by Anzeleh (see 120 a and b). An easy route from Urfeh to Samsat strikes the Severek—Hovek main road a few miles from Hovek [Boute 121). No details are available as to the road from Urfeh to Hovek. To the south of the line Mardin—Veiran Shehr—Urfeh there is now the important line of communication afforded by the railway from Eas el-Ain to Jerablus which passes south of Harran (see pp. 23, 416). It is probable that the road-communication between Nisibin and Eas el-Ain, and Mardin and Eas el-Ain, has recently been much improved (see above, p. 25, and compare 126, introduction, and 94, m. 17). The plains north of the railway are apparently fairly easy in spring when water is least scarce and grazing abundant: but in summer the heat and aridity of the country would make movement very difficult. Some account is given in this volume of desert-routes to Derek and Veiran Shehr (see 127, 128). There is very little water between Eas el-Ain and Harran (see 129 a), or on the route from Eas el-Ain and Urfeh 128), but the country is open and easy. Between Urfeh and Harran the route follows the line of an ancient made road, passable for wheels, across arid country (see Boute 130). From Harran to Jerablus the route passes at first over a stoneless plain with very little water: as it approaches the Euphrates water becomes fairly plentiful, and the fertile Migteleh valley is passed : there are some low stonehills80 INTKODUCTION towards the Euphrates, but the country in most places would be passable for field artillery or light carts in dry weather: the stone- less parts would, it is said, be impassable after rain 129 b). The couutry between Jerablus or Tel Ahmar and Urfeh seems to be open, easy, and passable for wheels, though much of it would prob ably be heavy going after rain (Bou 124). The route Jerablus— Urfeh passes through the Seruj district. At Jerablus the Eas el-Ain—Aleppo railway crosses the Euphrates (see p. 416). From the Middle Euphrates in the region of Deir ez-Zor the line of the Khabur and the Jaghjagha seems to afford a fairly easy route northward to Nisibin, over country likely to be heavy in wet weather, but fairly open. Light vehicles might be able to pass, and improve ment of the track should be easy. Water from the Khabur and Jaghjagha : cultivation in patches (see 125). Similarly the course of the Belikh river gives a line for a route from Eaqqah to Harran (see Routes 132 a and b). The country between the Khabur and the Belikh and between the Belikh and the Euphrates is a rolling plain inhabited only by nomads, with water at scattered wells or (in spring) in pools and wadis. The country between the Khabur and the Belikh seems to be particularly desolate 131). The Euphrates Valley between Meskeneh and Sams at, and country west of the euphrates towards the line Aleppo—Mar'ash General Remarks. —The belt of country west of the Euphrates with which this volume is concerned is for the most part an open rolling plain, well cultivated here and there, especially in the neigh bourhood of Aleppo, Killis, and Aintab. The country gradually rises from the south in higher undulations and low downs, easy to traverse, up to the foot of the Taurus mountains. It is crossed by a number of fair roads, passable for wheels at least in dry weather. The water-supply is on the whole fairly plentiful. The Euphrates valley in this region is apparently not very difficult, at least below Birijik, but movement along it is somewhat obstructed by wadis and ravines, and there has been little traffic along the greater part of it. The country on either bank becomes gradually higher and more hilly towards the north. General Description of Routes. —On the Euphrates, from Meskeneh as far as Birijik, upstream navigation by steamers might be possible except in the months of low water (August-November), and at the height of the spring floods (see further IV I). Downstream navigation by shahhturs is practised on this part of the river through out the year.5 INTRODUCTION 31 Navigation by raft (downstream only) is possible, at least under favourable conditions, from Erzingan on the Frat Su and from 3 or 4 hrs. above Palu on the Murad ; but where the Euphrates breaks through the main line of the Eastern Taurus, between Kumur Khan and Chunkush Ferry, there are some very bad and difficult rapids which may make navigation by rafts impossible in the highest flood and perhaps also when the river is low (see further IV I). On the 1. (eastern) side of the Euphrates valley, there appears to be little traffic, though caravans sometimes made the journey. On the last 15 miles into Birijik the track has been improved in places. Water from the river; grazing good in spring (see 133). From Birijik to opposite Rum Qal'ah and thence at varying distances from the river past Samsat to join the Severek—Hovek road at Mishmishin, runs a fairly easy road, which might with some improve ment be passable for wheels (see Ro 135, 115). From this route near Rum Qal'ah a track diverges to Kilik Saghpir 144). Along the r. (western) side of the valley above Meskeneh traffic seems to be even more infrequent. Some account is given below of the country between Qal'at en-Nejm and a point opposite Birijik (see Boute 134). Above Birijik the undulations become higher and ravines more difficult. A track from Aintab to Adiaman, not passable for wheels, runs near this part of the Euphrates. The only bridge across this part of the Euphrates is that which carries the railway at Jerablus. Birijik ferry has been the principal crossing-place for caravans going east and west. There are also ferries at Meskeneh, Tel Ahmar, Kilik, Khalfati, Rum Qal'ah, Samsat, Chunkush, and other points. West of the Euphrates this volume is concerned only with routes running from the river to Aleppo, Killis, Aintab, Mar ash, Behisni, Adiaman and Kiakhta. From Meskeneh to Aleppo run routes quite passable for wheels, though somewhat heavy in wet weather ; water is generally fairly plentiful, and there is a good deal of cultivation (see 136). From Tel Ahmar to Aleppo an unmade track, easy except in wet weather, leads by Memblj and El-Bab (see 137). From Jerablus to Aleppo the railway runs by Akterineh and Muslimiyeh (see pp. 412-416). From Birijik to Akterineh and thence to Aleppo there is a well-frequented caravan-route, passable for wheels, with a good supply of water [Boute 139). Between Zambur on this road and Jerablus is a cross-track described in 141b, and a track along the Sajur Chai connects Tel Ahmar with the same road about 5 m. from Zambur (see Boute 140). Another cross-track joins Erkija near Zambur with Aintab,32 INTRODUCTION From Jerablus to Killis a track runs over undulating country which is in most places passable for field artillery and carts in dry weather: but the Wassa and Sejur rivers are somewhat serious obstacles, and the track itself is not everywhere wide enough for wheels [Route 141 a). From Birijik to Killis a rough cart-track over undulating ground runs by Nizib and Tel el-Bashara, striking the Killis—'Aintab chaussee some miles north of Killis (see 142). This cart-track is well supplied with water and could be easily improved. It gives the shortest line from Birijik to Alexandretta. From Birijik to Aintab there is a route, which diverges from the Killis road at Nizib. This also is passable for wheels 143 a). The direct route from Birijik to Mar'ash, which does not pass through Aintab, also diverges from Nizib, beyond which it is not passable for wheels (Boute 143 b). From Eum Qal'ah to Aintab there are at least three possible tracks, of which one is stated to be passable for wheels, and the others may be so 145 a, b, c). From Kilik a track over easy open country runs to Behisni (see Route 146), and a road passable for wheels leads from Samsat to Behisni and Belveren and on by Baghdin to Mar'ash : water is plentiful on this route, which lies over easy rolling downs, and sup plies are fairly plentiful in normal times (see 147, and note at end of route). Mule-tracks running along the skirts of the Taurus also connect Belveren with Mar'ash (see 147). A road runs from Samsat to Adiaman, which is connected with Behisni on the W. by a road practicable for carts, and with Kiakhta and Gerger on the E. and Kilik on the S. by apparently inferior tracks (see Boutes 149, 150 a, b, c). Tracks also run from Samsat to Kiakhta (see Boute 148). All the country N. and NW. of Samsat up to the skirts of the Taurus, though undulating, is easy, and roads could be quickly made and improved. It is well watered with streams from the north. For the routes connecting Aleppo, Aintab, and Mar'ash and those which lead across the mountains lying north of Kiakhta, Adiaman, Behisni, and Belveren, see pp. 410, 411. Note on the Nestorian and Armenian Population Eeferences to population in the description of towns and villages date from the period before the war. But it must be remembered that owing to the war many of these references have now only an historical value. The Nestorians and Armenians have suffered especially severely, and while it is obviously impossible to give details, this note may serve to indicate certain districts within the limits of this volume which have been specially affected. TheINTRODUCTION 38 Nestorian villages of the Urmia plain, of Salmas, Barandiz, Ter- gavar, and other districts, were plundered, and many were destroyed, by Kurds and Turks in 1915. The Nestorian mountaineers of the Zab basin (Hakkiari) were attacked ; many were killed ; some 20,000-30,000 escaped in September 1915 to the Salmas district, then reoccupied by the Eussians. The villages of the Berwari, Tiari, Tkhuma, Kochannes, Bash Qal'ah, and other districts were nearly all destroyed : the survivors remaining in the mountains were prob ably very few. The massacre of Nestorians in and near Jezlret-ibn- 'Omar has also been reported. The Armenians of the Urmia and Salmas districts shared the fate of the Nestorians of that region. Those of Van and the neighbour hood were greatly reduced by warfare, massacre, or hardship suffered during their flight to Russian territory. The Armenian villages of the Van district, of the country S. of Lake Van, between Van and Bitlis, of the Shattakh and Nerdosh districts, &amp;c., were largely destroyed. Elsewhere, between February and October 1915, whole sale deportations of Armenians were organized. These were often preceded or accompanied by massacre: many emigrants died on the march, of disease or starvation. Apart from the Armenians of the Vilayet of Van, those of the following towns and districts in the area covered by this volume seem to have been almost wholly removed by massacre or deportation:—Bitlis and district, Sairt, Diarbekr and district, Mardin (where other Christian sects are said also to have suffered), Severek, Urfeh (where the Armenians armed and resisted the deportation order for about a month), Killis, Aintab, Adiaman, Behisni, Mar ash. The Armenians deported from these areas, as well as the main body who were removed from Turkish Armenia proper and Anatolia, were sent southwards. Some may have been planted near and S. of Mosul (but there seems to be no clear evidence on this point). Others were settled round Ras el-Ain; others round Aleppo or between that city and the Euphrates (as at El-Bab and Membij) ; many were sent to Syria (Damascus, Hama, Homs, and neighbourhood): but the greatest number were planted along the Euphrates valley below Meskeneh. Concentrations of immigrants are mentioned at and near Raqqah, Deir ez-Zor, and Meyyadln. Some seem to have been sent farther S., towards Baghdad. Deir ez-Zor appears to have been the chief centre in 1915 and early in 1916. It was estimated in February 1916, that there were some 500,000 deported Armenians settled in Mesopotamia and Syria, the greater part in Mesopotamia. The mortality among them was very high. It is possible that Armenians have been employed on road-making and similar labour. MES. IV r ,RIVER ROUTES THE TIGRIS EOUTE III G DIARBEKE—MOS0L (388i m.) AuthoritiesMilitary Report on E.T.A., vol. iii, Koute 99 (to JezIret-ibn-'Omar, report of a journey by raft in April 1903 : from Jeziret to Mosul, report of a journey by raft in October 1892). Report of a journey by raft from Diarbekr to Jeziret in June 1907. D. Fraser, Short Gut to India (Journey of 1908). The Tigris over this portion of its course is only navigable by JceleJcs (rafts) floated downstream. Because of this fact the upstream itinerary followed in previous volumes is departed from for this section of the river, and an account is given of its navigation and other features downstream from Diarbekr to Mosul. At Diarbekr the Tigris spreads out to some extent on entering the small level tract opposite that town, and in seasons of flood attains a width of 250-300 yds. The country through which it flows immediately after leaving Diarbekr is a stretch of mud hills and stony desert, the mud banks being the haunt of hosts of water-birds. The snow-capped mountains of Kurdistan are just visible on the horizon, with low undulating land extending towards them. The Tigris flows here in wide curves. The banks are thinly peopled, and the country about them only partially cultivated, but there are rich pasture grounds occasionally resorted to by nomad tribes. The mud banks at times give way to steep rocky sides, in the walls of which are often found rock-tombs. Here and there the narrow bed of the river widens over flats of sandstone. Sheep, goats, cattle, and buffaloes are seen on the banks or in the stream. Immediately after its junction with the Batman Su the river becomes narrower and deeper, and flows so rapidly through winding gorges that careful steering is required to avoid rocks and whirlpools. Between Bediyeh BTHE TIGRIS—EOUTE III G 35 and Hasan Kaif the cave-dwelling Kurds, Arabs, and Yezidis try to levy blackmail on all who pass downstream. Their method is to post men at intervals along the bank, who keep up a constant fire at keleks, either killing people on board or perforating the skins so that the Tcelehs have to put to shore. One protection against this is the great rate at which the current passes through some gorges in this district, so that it is difficult for the robbers to arrest the progress of the rafts. The villages are most often found on narrow points of land round which the stream curves. On ground a little higher than the village are generally to be found a loop-holed tower and the well-built stone house of the headman. After Hasan Kaif the valley widens out somewhat between mountain ranges. There is very little cultivation as far as the Hazo Su, but more is seen after that river is passed, chiefly on the 1. bank, which slopes gently up to the hills. Between the junction of the Bohtan Su and Jezlret-ibn-'Omar the river becomes much more rapid and soon enters a mountainous tract, flowing through rocky gorges, whose sides are covered with oak-scrub. The river flows in a series of sharp bends round spurs, and navi gation becomes more difficult owing to eddies and back currents. From JezTret-ibn-'Omar to Mosul the Tigris flows in a tortuous course between low hills and undulations intersected by one large valley (that of the Khabur) and by numerous ravines. The banks rise here and there in cliffs 50-100 ft. high. Here, as above Jezlret-ibn-'Omar, the river contains numerous rapids and shallows formed by ledges of rock and shingle. The IceleJt is a raft of timber or poles and brushwood lashed with tamarisk or willow bark supported on inflated sheep-skins, the necks of which are tied with liquorice fibre or hemp. The size of the is reckoned by the number of skins used, and payment is made accordingly. A good-sized raft would be carried on 400-500 skins ; the largest in use have about 800 skins. A of 200 skins is said to measure about 29 x 20 ft. The load ranges from about 5 to 36 tons. The Iceleh, if well constructed, is practically unsinkable. These rafts can only move with the current, and are guided by two or four rough sweeps, according to their size. On arrival at their destination the timber or scantlings are sold, and the deflated skins are returned overland to the starting-point. The Tcelehjis or raftmen usually talk Arabic and Kurdish, and are a willing set of men who would make good pilots. The raft has a mooring rope plaited from strips of bark. At the mooring-places where there are no mooring-posts, the rope is laid out on the shore and a small heap of stones placed on it: a collection of such heaps c 224| 86 EIVER ROUTES marks a usual lialting-place for Tcelel The cost of a passage on a keleJc from Diarbekr to Mosul is said to be about and the voyage is accomplished in about 4-8 days in March, April, and May, but in other months it usually takes much longer—from 8 to 20 days, according to the condition of the river and the weather. A raft is said to travel at rates varying according to the strength of the current from 3ij to 8 m.p.h. Wind is a dangerous impediment to the navigation of the more difficult portions of the river, and this is particularly noticeable when the helelc has any superstructure to catch the wind. A strong wind consequently makes travelling very difficult. The direction of the wind is immaterial. If it is favourable in one reach, in the next it may be blowing on shore. Left Bank.

MES, IV ETHE EUPHRATES EOUTE IV I BIEIJIK—MESKENEH Authority: —Dobbs, Eeport on a Journey by river from Birijik to Fellujeh, January-February 1903. Between Birijik and Meskeneli, the navigation of the river down stream by a shakMur presented no serious difficulties in January 1903, except at the rapids just below Jerablus. Depths varied from 6 to 12 ft. ? but the river was unusually full for the season. The current varied from 3 to 4^ m.p.h. except at the rapids near Jerablus and below El-Hammam ? where it rose to 6 m.p.h. The width of the river was 150—250 yds., except where it broadened to ^ m. below Qalat en-Nejm. At the Jerablus rapid the navigable channel was only 25 yds. The authority referred to above, in discussing generally the possibilities of steam-navigation on the Euphrates between Birijik and Fellujeh, comes to the conclusion that the downstream journey would be easy from April to July, but that the upstream navigation would be very slow: and that in the l.w. season (August-November) navigation by steamer would be too risky to be profitable (commercially). The principal dangers which he mentions as likely to attend navigation of the ^Euphrates from December to March are not connected with this section of the river. It is reported that the Germans have established a river-port at Jerablus, and they may have done something to improve navigation on this part of the river. The bed of the stream is of soft mud or gravel. Along the river stretches a fertile belt of land producing wheat and barley ^without irrigation, and containing scattered mud villages. It varies from 1 to 3 m. in length and is bounded by low chalk or gypsum hills. The Aleppo—Ras el- e Ain railway crosses the Euphrates at Jerablus by a steel bridge (see p. 416). At Birijik the river is usually about 300 yds. wide. Its greatest width in flood is 700-800 yds. There is a strong current. A depth of 8 ft. is sometimes found, but usually there is 5-6 ft. of water. The approaches on the 1. bank are much steeper than those on the r.EOUTE IV I 67 The following is the account given by Mr. Dobbs of the navigation of the river from Birijik to Meskeneh in January 1903 :— 'Between Birijik and Alif Orfu (Oghlu?) the average depth is 12 ft., the pace of the current 3 m.p.h., and the width of the river 200 yds. | m. below Alif Orfu (Oghlu ?) is an island unnamed about 1 m. in length. The navigable channel goes to the r. ^ m. further down is another small island unnamed. The navigable channel goes to the 1. Here the stream increases to 4^ m.p.h. and continues at that pace until past Jerablus. . . . The stream as far as this point seems now to present no difficulties to navigation, and the depth was in no places where I sounded less than 6 ft. HfM 'Half a mile below the ruins of Jerablus the pace of the cur rent increases to about 6 m.p.h., and there is a somewhat dangerous Jo» rapid lasting about 500 yards. The navigable channel is only about 11, 25 yards broad, but in this channel the depth of water is ample, ii6to being about 12 ft. At the head of the rapid the channel keeps in irreBl mid-stream. After 350 yards it runs close in under the high 1. bank s wi and continues on this course until the rapids end 150 yards further )f fc down. We passed some boats full of grain stuck in the rapids about below half-way down, having kept too much to the left, and our boatmen and said that numbers of boats were lost here every year. One and iss j]ij a half miles lower down, opposite Yerablis Zir (? Ashaghi Jerablus), irate! a village on r. bank, there is another rapid stretch, extending j {I j over a distance of about 3 m., the current being about m.p.h. ; ty This rapid, however, contains no shallows. About 6 m. below j tlie Jerablus we passed the island known as Jezireli Ahmad, the navi- le too gable channel going to the right. About 4 m. lower down is the island of Boiraz, the navigable channel, 100 yds. broad, going to the fjoji left. The pace of the current, which had been only about 3 m.p.h., ,jy er here increased to about 5 m.p.h., the average depth of the water . r t a t being 9 ft, At the S. end of Boiraz, the stream spreads into several ya tioi small channels, the navigable one goes to the left and is not more than 50 yds. wide. Three m. lower down (about 3 m. above Qizil r [y e i Euyuk) is the island of Qirq Maghareh, the navigable channel going ^jt to the left. About a mile below Hammam there is a short piece of | roI1! rapid, the current about 6 m.p.h., but no shallows, the depth being jj[ s about 6 ft., and a short way below this is the whirlpool of Chaulik, A[jjj which is said to offer some difficulties in heavy floods. From this point to a point about 3 m. below Qal'at en-Nejm the width of the ■ atest river is about 150 yds., the current about 3 m.p.h., and the average , ^ depth 6 ft. At the latter point the stream broadens out over a wide llj gravelly bed, the width of which is about m., and this broad stretch continues for about 6 m., the navigable channel, about 6 ft. deep, '■ e 268 THE EUPHKATES being close to r. bank. Therefrom, until opposite the shrine of Sheikh Arud (a distance of about 25 m.), the river resumes its ordinary breadth of about 250 yds., the current being about 8 m.p.h. A short way below Sheikh Arud is the island of Mugharab el- Baghl, about 7 m. long. The navigable stream goes to the left and the current increases to about 4J m.p.h. Two m. below the N. end of this island is a second smaller island, and the navigable channel passes between the two. The width of the channel past the islands is about 100 yds. From these islands to near the place shown as Surje or El-Hammam on Dr. Kiepert's map, a distance of about 80 m., the average width is about 250 yds., the current 3 m.p.h., and the depth 8 ft. Navigation of this stretch presents no difficulties. . . . Three m. above Meskeneh is the Jeziret el-Mullah, the navigable stream going to the right. Opposite Meskeneh again is an island, the navigable channel going to the left.' The flat-bottomed boats known as are built at Birijik. They are oblong in shape, 18 ft. long, 8 ft. wide, with a depth from gunwale to flooring of about 2^ ft. They draw l^ft. fully loaded. The bottom consists of tree-trunks sawn in half, beneath which flat boards are nailed, and a flooring of flat boards is fastened 1 ft. above the bottom. The sides and ends of the boats consist of flat boards roughly nailed together, the interstices being stuffed with rags daubed with bitumen. The cost of building a boat of this sort is said to-be about £T 4-|. One boat carries about 5 tons. nearly always travel in pairs, fastened together side by side. They are steered by clumsy sweeps, pulled in the bow, and are so unman ageable that they can only travel in a flat calm. They carry mer chandise downstream and are towed back empty. Raft Navigation on the Uppee Euphrates Downstream navigation by JceleJcs is possible on this section of the river and also, under favourable conditions, above Birijik from Erzingan on the Frat Su and from about three or four hours above Palu on the Murad. But where the Euphrates breaks through the main line of the Taurus, between Kumur Khan and Chunkush Ferry, there are some very bad and dangerous rapids. In April 1839, when the river was in high flood, these rapids were found by von Moltke to be quite impracticable: and it seems that they are extremely difficult, and perhaps impracticable, when the river is low. See further Military Beport vol. iv, p. 152. For description of JceleJcs see Introduction to Iloute III O.LAND KOUTES CENTEAL KUEDISTAN 1 KOUTE 60 a EANIYEH—URMIA (1631 M.) Authority;— Military Report on E.T.A., vol. iii, Route 108 (report of 1902), This route would form a main line of advance into north-western Persia from eastern Turkey in Asia, but would entail much labour in preparation and upkeep for the passage of large forces. The nature of the road varies greatly from good going over open level ground to steep ascents and descents through close and hilly country or marshy and swampy plains. It is only in parts passable for all arms. In some stages the road is too steep for heavy traffic and would require much labour to lessen the gradient. The Shulduz Chai, Lesser Zab, and Nistan Su are all difficult to ford and would be impassable in flood time, and at such times the whole of the adjacent marshy land would be impracticable to animals. The alternative route given between Eaniyeh and El-Watan Ser Desht 60 b) makes a detour over 40 m. longer than the main route, and can be further varied by intermediate hill tracks. Snow, blocks the passes on the route leading out from Raniyeh during January and February, and military operations along the route would not be practicable in winter. The Urmia plain is very fertile and productive, but supplies else where are limited. Grain is fairly plentiful in all the cultivated districts, but would be difficult to obtain in the hilly parts of the route, while grass is scarce in the hills, though probably easier to get in the plain. A certain amount of forest is met with in the hilly 1 Authorities consulted for Routes 60a-89b are marked with an asterisk in the list given in the general Bibliographical Note at the end of the volume (p. 459).

Dried cow-dung is the chief fuel of the plains. Spring water and streams are plentiful along most of the route. Pack buffaloes, donkeys, and zebus can be got on the later stages near Urmia, but it is doubtful whether in great numbers, while in the hilly stages probably very few would be available.

General direction, N. by E. To Dizeh (90 m.) the route was before the war only a rough but fairly easy mule-track, but from that place to Urmia (68|m.) it was almost practicable for wheels, though needing improvement here and there (see below, m. 90, m.

Hebtian (Havdian). Here was a post of 50 Nizam troops in 1900. From the village the road ascends the valley, crossing to 1. bank, passing several small villages and going through fine oak forests and good grazing grounds. At the head of the valley it ascends rather steeply through oak forest to Mergasur Gedik (alt. 4,250 ft.), a pass over the W. end of the S. watershed of the Kudbar-i-Baras-Grlr, a large stream flowing from the Haruni districts to E. A rather steep descent leads down a wooded spur, through a well- cultivated valley dotted with Kurdish villages. Ford the Iludbar-i-Baras-Gir, whence a low col is crossed into a cultivated valley. 2 £ani Hesh., Kurdish village of 30 houses, situated in the Baradost plain, of which it is the principal place. The track now ascends the valley of the Rudbar-i-Haji Beg, a large mountain stream, feeder of the Eukuchuk Su, which is a tributary of the Great Zab. Track leaves the villages of Zerwa and Sire high up on r., and crosses the stream to its N. or r. bank at Begijni, a small village with a mud fort and a saptieh post, from which a narrow track leads up the stream to the Persian frontier. A steep ascent leads to Shapatan, a Kurdish village at the head of Girdi valley, draining SW. to the Zab. On the banks of the stream, 2 m. down to 1., is Jemmo.

Cross a mountain stream with steep wooded sides 2 m. up which is Evlian, 60 Kurd houses. The base of a rocky crag is now skirted, the track sometimes going up the bed of the stream, and then following a very rough, stony track, through low trees and bushes until, at an altitude of 2,940 ft., it leaves the stream where it is 30 to 40 yds. broad in September. Ascend through a scattered oak forest, meeting the alternative track Evlian. Cross another stream running down a deep valley from the well-wooded Bashi-Ruwan Dagh.

Turco- Persian Boundary Commission Map, 1914 ; W.O. Maps, 1916, sheets 33, 34. Except in the Lahjan plain this route runs through hill-country, and a great deal of work would be necessary to make it passable for wheels through its whole length. It seems, however, that if the southern route from Rowanduz to Gellala be taken a fairly easy mule route can be found throughout in summer and autumn. In winter the passes are blocked by snow. For descriptions of particular parts of the route, see below on the two roads to Gellala, and also p. 95, and under m. 39^ and m. 54^. Supplies are hot plentiful except in the Lahjan plain and near Suj Bulaq. Scrub on hills for firewood. Water apparently abundant from mountain streams. From Rowanduz to the neighbourhood (apparently) of GellalaROUTES 61 c, d 93 two tracks, one by Dar es-Salam, the other by Dergala, have been described in detail. They diverge at a point about 3| m. from Eowanduz, whence the track by Dar es-Salam runs to the N. of the Eowanduz Chai, while that by Dergala continues S. of the river. The northern road was described in 1902 as a well-used caravan road, though it was then difficult even for pack-animals (especially about m. 11^). On the other hand, the southern route seems to be referred to in information communicated in 1910 by the hereditary chief of Eowanduz. According to this information there is good useful road' to Dergala (5 hrs.) and ' 4 hours' pretty easy going, but stony' from Dergala to Gellala. The detailed description of the southern route given below dates from 1881. Miles from Rowan- duz o Ri 2 4 8| 114 (i) Northern Route to the Gellala Valley Rowanduz. Leave the town by the bridge over Kalund gorge, and ascend the 1. bank of the Eowanduz Chai by a good mule-track. Pass Jinijian in a valley to r. Track follows the 1. bank closely, crossing one or two spurs of shaley rock and two small streams. The river flows in a fine gorge between perpendicular cliffs. Cross to r. bank by a bridge 6 yds. long and 5 ft. wide, some 40 ft. above the stream. (Southern route continues by 1. bank.) Cross a spur crowned by a grove of trees containing a ziydret. This ascent avoids the gorge. Descend again to river. Ascend again over a spur and reach the valley, which here has cultivation on the 1. bank of the stream. (A stone bridge with 4 piers, 30 yds. long and 3 ft. wide, 25 ft. above the stream, crosses the river here, and a path leads from it to Warikowan.) Continue along N. side of valley. Cross two spurs and pass Zawa, 1^ m. to 1. The valley on the r. bank opens out somewhat. Descend face of cliff by stairs in the rock, partly made and partly natural, and extremely difficult for animals. The river makes a bend to NE. and back again. Its bed contracts, and the heights on either side are perpen dicular. Pass the remains of two old brick bridges; but94 LAND EOUTES Miles from Rowan- duz there appears to be no room for a road along 1. bank. After descent mentioned above, track runs along a stony beach and then ascends again from the river level. Pass Farsirin on opposite bank, where the cliffs somewhat recede. The road becomes very bad. Descend to river. Ford river (alt. 2,700 ft.). The ford is difficult on account of the swiftness of the current and the boulders in the bed. Stream 10 yds. wide, 3 ft. deep (end of November). The banks are steep and the approaches are difficult for laden animals. Steep, bad ascent from river. Ascend the face of a hill after passing a stream flowing down a side valley. Turn along a narrow path in the steep hill-side following the general direction of the Kowanduz Chai, which here flows nearly from N. Descend into steep rocky valley of ' stream from the north' (this is apparently the Eowanduz Chai). Cross the stream, and ascend the river bed. Keldkan on cliffs above the r. bank. Track passes through village. Stiff ascent from river, which here makes a bend to S. round two hills. Cross a col and descend steeply for a short distance. Dar es-Salam, small village 200 yds. to 1. above the road. Descend steeply into a narrow valley and ascend again to a col, after which follow a narrow path curling round a hill. Descend into valley (apparently the valley of a tributary of the Kovvanduz Chai). Gellala is on the far side of the valley : a steep ascent leads to it, but the main route continues along the valley of the Eowanduz Chai. Gellala is the head-quarters of a in the Eowanduz Kaza, comprising some 36 small villages chiefly in habited by Balak Kurds. In 1902 the chief of the Balak lived at Walash, 1^ hrs. from Merga (or Merkussan), which is visible from Gellala in a broad valley to the S. of the Eowanduz Chai. A track leads NE. from Gellala to the Kurdish district of Eust, hrs. distant. Gellala has a good water-supply from a mountain stream. Figs, pears, mulberries, and oaks grow round the village, and there are vines on the side of the valley. in ti iiROUTE 61 d 95 (ii) Southern Route to Gellala Miles from Rowan- duz o H 5 6 m 13 14 19 20i? 24i (For general description ^from local information of 1910 see p. 93) Rowanduz.

Ascend valley of a tributary stream to SE. Head of valley. Begin steep zigzag ascent. Soil is a soft shale. Summit (alt. 4,500 ft.). Descend by r. bank of stream. Pass Dergala, with ruined castle (alt. 3,300 ft.). The hill- slopes are wooded and steep. The track turns E., and passes through well-grown oak woods. Cross large tributary of the Rowanduz Chai, flowing from the Qandil Dagh. Pass Chokai. Cross spur and reach 'Omerava, a few huts on the Rowanduz Chai. Skirt the r. bank by a path which in many places is built on an almost precipitous hill-side. (It is difficult to trace the relation between routes (i) and (ii) here: it appears that route (i) lies somewhat further away from the Rowanduz Chai.) Ray an, 25 huts, 'just beyond a splendid gorgeAuthority says, ' Slopes very precipitous, but having several small villages with cultivation and vineyards: by fording the stream a more level route could be taken along the sole of the valley, and a passable route for guns madeIt is not clear whether this description applies to the river valley below or above Rayan. Apparently in this neighbourhood is Gellala (see Route (i), m. 23^). The place is not mentioned by the authority of 1881. (Mileage continued from Route (i) to Gellala.) The route from Gellala to Rayat was described in 1910 by the hereditary chief of Rowanduz as 6 hrs.' pretty easy going. It is not certain whether this description refers to the track described in detail below, which was followed by an authority of 1902.96 LAND ROUTES G-ellala. rrom the village join main road (see p. 94) and ascend the valley. Cross some spurs, the road keeping about m. from the river. Pass Wapurdand, a small village up a ravine to r. (apparently on the opposite side of the river). Reach a projecting spur, which runs down to the river bank and terminates in cliffs. It is difficult for animals to climb its rocky sides, and when the water is low an easier way can be found by following the stream-bed and rounding the base of the cliffs. Beyond the spur, at its foot, ford to opposite bank. The river is here 15 yds. wide and not more than ft. of water was found here (end of November). The bottom is covered with boulders. (At this ford the route would appear to cross to the bank, the track from Gellala having hitherto been on the right, so far as can be gathered from the description. The Military Report, however, has ' ford to the right bank '; compare m. 35^ below.) Cross an open space and climb over a projecting spur similar to the last. Beyond this second spur the cliffs recede, leaving a flat space on either side of the river, where there is a little cultivation. Ascend from river-bed and cross a very stony spur. Halgor is passed on a plateau, high up on the r. bank. Valley opens out a little. Pass Derbend at the mouth of a ravine on the r. bank. The path now runs above the 1. bank. (From an account based on a report of 1881 it would appear that another track runs along the r. bank ; but the description is obscure.) Cross the Howanduz Chai (here called Binustan Su by authority of 1902, and apparently the Chiwa Sheikh on the Turco-Persian Boundary Commission Map of 1914). In 1902 there was here a bridge 10 yds. long and 3 ft. wide, made of branches laid crosswise on baulks and covered with earth ; passable for horses in single file. The banks are steep and the river is a mountain torrent in a rocky bed. In November the bridge was 15 ft. above the water level.

Eayat lies about | m. NE. of this junction. One track is marked as running up r. bank of the Chiwa Sheikh from the crossing, passing Baba Kerrawa on 1. bank and leaving Eayat less than ^ m. to N.) 39^ Rayat, small village of Balak Kurds. In 1910 there was here a Turkish frontier post containing a quarantine station, a telegraph office (line from liowanduz ?), and a zaptieTi post. From Rayat a track leads in a general NXE. direction to Jildigan on the Passova-Ushnu road (see 60 a, under m. 93|). This track passes Alaneli village (m. 2), the Pinnan Galan col (m. 3|), and the Barzineh Pass (m. 7), where the Persian frontier is crossed. It seems that from the Barzineh Pass the route con tinues to Zevka (m. 121). Apparently from Zevka a track runs N. leading direct to TJslinu Garanga. The track to Jildigan runs by Girda Kaotan. Jildigan is reached about m. Between Eayat and Shinawa the passes are sometimes blocked by snow in winter for one, two, or even three months. The natives then use a kind of snow-shoe. The road from Kayat to Shinawa proceeds E. on the N. side of the Chiwa Sheikh, or Binustan Su. 40i Pass Alatan (Alaneh ?) up valley to 1., bearing NNW. (340°). 42^ Sheikh. Kemal, small hamlet of Mamash Kurds which in 1902 belonged to Haji Sheikh Seyyid Kemal ed-Din, a a man of great local influence. He had a mosque here, and the place was much visited, though ' no accommoda tion or supplies' could be obtained in the village. A mountain stream supplied water. (On Boundary Commission Map of 1914 the only village marked in the neighbourhood is Bar el-Aman on the N. side of the Chiwa Sheikh valley, about 1 m. from the stream.) Bescend over open downs with some cultivation. 44^ Valley closes in. Enter a rocky gorge with bare hills on either hand.

It goes down to a ferry by which the river is crossed to Surin, on r. bank of the Undbar-i-Shin at its junction with the Zab, Ashkufa, 40 houses, being on the opposite side of the stream, here 30 yds. wide and containing much snow-water in May. From this point the Heriki tribes, bringing their flocks in the spring to the Tergavvar plain near Urmia, follow the route to Oramar and thence via Dlzeh ; this constitutes the shortest route from Mosul to Urmia, and is passable for mules. The road now crosses the Zab valley and enters Tang-i-Eelindeh, a great gorge in the Muzeran district, through which the Rudbar-i-Shln passes between the Gkirajar Dagh on N., and the Shlrindari Dagh on S. The road is extraordinarily bad, ascending and descending over precipitous places, and hardly distinguishable as atrack, although laden horses get along it. The stream is 25-30 yds. wide, flowing swiftly. The scarp on the 1. bank is sheer, nowhere supporting even a foot- track.- Abrupt ascent leads over a low neck to the valley of the Yahudi Chai. The river is reached and apparently crossed just above the pathless chasm through which it runs to join the JKudbar-i-Shln. Track leads along 1. bank high up above the stream. Henjbraka. Pass Jemajehu (alt. 3,500 ft.), across the valley on r. bank. The stream is crossed several times as the track ascends a gorge, narrow in the lower part and gradually becoming more open.

Beyond this the stream makes a deep bend to E., and an easy ascent leads to the top of a spur from which a fairly easy descent leads to the N. boundary of the Ileikan' nahiye. Nerva (alt. 4,050 ft.). The stream is met again. From Nerva the road ascends steeply by a fairly easy track. Tutun Yaila (alt. 6,000 ft.), descends by an easy track to a rill, which is followed until it meets a larger stream from N. which it descends for 1 m. to Eiri. Some distance below this the valley narrows to a rift 6 to 8 ft. wide : track here consists of steps cut in the rock. Track again meets the Eudbar-i-Shln and follows its r. bank for 1^ m. to Bliatunis, descends to the stream by a short length of stone staircase, and crosses it by a wicker- bridge, the water, 20 yds. broad in September, being a deep powerful torrent. From the bridge the route descends the 1. bank for a short distance and then turns up the valley of a small water course to NE., crosses its watershed, descends to the headwaters of an other stream, ascends steeply, rounds the head of a valley and descends by a steep but fairly broad track, with rock-cut steps at intervals, to a brook, from which an ascent, which gradually becomes steep, leads to Oramar.108 LAND ROUTES ROUTE 63 a NEKI—KOCHANNES (100 m.)

This is a fairly easy track, passable for wheeled traffic for the first 49-| m. and for the last 29 m. according to the W.O. map, which may be correct. Probably it could be made passable for wheels all the way by some levelling, widening, and clear ing, but there is no recent evidence regarding it. As far as Alkosh (m. 29) it lies over an undulating plain liable to be very heavy after rain. Beyond Alkosh the country becomes hilly, but the track remains generally broad and fairly easy. There was a narrow rough path in 1888 through the gorge of the Butaq Su (m. 33^), the track becoming broad and easy again beyond the gorge. It was reported that through the Tang-i-Darya Bada (m. 63^) the track might by levelling be made passable for artillery. Other narrow or stony parts (e.g. m. 51^) apparently could all be made passable for guns without much difficulty. There are at different places steep ascents and descents, none of which appears to be long, and at others bridges would require to be improved in order to carry guns. In June 1888 the streams were all fordable, but it was reported that the Dohuk Su through the Dorg Boghaz (m. 61-|) appeared to rise 10 ft. in flood. Water is rather scarce, and often bad, for the first 20-25 m. After that it becomes more plentiful, but is frequently brackish or bad owing to the presence of sulphur. The country generally is fertile and well cultivated, particularly in the plain as far as Alkosh (m. 29), but the valleys beyond also produce a good deal of wheat, rice, and fruit. The villages, however, are small, and large supplies could not be looked for. Wood and fuel are generally plentiful, at any rate after the hills are entered. Grazing appears to be good in the earlier part of the year, but is burnt up, at any rate in places, by the beginning of June. Miles from Mosul 0 Mosul.

Water from the stream said to be bad; is strongly impregnated with sulphur. The best water is from springs some distance to K See below, m. 50|. There is a masonry stronghold, 100 yds. square, which was rather ruinous in 1888. The neighbouring hill-sides are steep, but are covered with brushwood: in June the grass was burnt up. E. of the town is a valley 3 m. wide filled with vineyards and fig orchards. There is a con siderable grain market here, and a large bazaar where all kinds of fruits and vegetables are sold, and whence the Kurds obtain cotton goods, leather, and ironwork. The place is the seat of a Kaimmakam under Mosul. The track follows the r. bank of the Dohuk Su, and descends a low spur through wheat fields. Ford the stream to the 1. bank, 30 ft. wide and 1 ft. deep in June, with gravelly bottom. Above this ford are the remains of an old bridge, only the piers remaining in 1888 ; there had been 1 span of 30 ft.

From a point somewhat to S. of the village the W.O. map shows the road to be passable for wheeled traffic. An alternative track, reported in June 1888 to be better than that detailed here, branches off more to the W., rejoining at the Plr-i-Dawud (see m. 80|). Follow a zigzag track down a spur to a V-shaped ravine- Cross and recross the stream-bed in the ravine (alt. 2,480 ft.); then along a narrow ledge in a clay slope, the track going through hills covered with low oaks and brush wood.

It is crossed by a bridge, the Pir-i-Dawud, 58 yds. long, with a planked centre span, 4 ft. wide and 27 ft. long, and 4 masonry arches with a 6-ft. roadway. This bridge is untrustworthy, and it is best to ford the stream, which was 20 ft. wide and 6 ins. deep in June. Here the better alternative track from Zauka (m. 76^ above) rejoins. From the bridge the road consists of a broad gravelly track, with an easy gradient, which follows a grassy slope among low shrubs and vineyards and then winds up to Daudiyeh (alt. 3,015 ft.), village of 40 Chaldean and 20 Kurdish houses, overlooking a deep valley to the SE. It is the head-quarters of a Kaimmakam under Mosul.

The road passes over the Ser Amadiyeh, a ridge rising to an altitude of about 10,000 ft., and descends through the well-wooded Berwari district, to the Great Zab river. It crosses this at 13 m , goes E. for a short distance into the Tkhuma district, at m. 21 crosses Route 68 b (about m. 36), and then, turning N., crosses a ridge and again descends to the Zab (m. 31^). It follows the 1. bank of the river, at m. 55 meets Route 68 b, and crosses the river again at m. 60|. Beyond this it turns up a ravine to Julamerk. The track is extremely bad, hardly fit for laden mules, which, in fact, have to be unloaded at certain places. Many small villages are MES. IV.

Alternative Boute 68 b (Amadiyeh—Julamerk, via Lizan) branches off here, and is preferred by travellers ; it might have to be used if the Zab were impassable at m. 13, or at the l.w. ford 11 m. below that point. See below under m. 12. A track branches off here through Malakdeh. to the Zab bridge (m. 13). Cross an outlying ridge, the Matineh. Dagh, with a small plateau just beyond the summit. Descend by steep zigzags: difficult track which gets worse as it proceeds. Terwanish (alt. 3,500 ft.). Beyond the village the track becomes more difficult, crosses a spur, and turns down a side valley to N. Track enters a valley 2 m. wide, down which flows a stream, a tributary of the Zab. The slopes become more rocky as the Zab is approached. Junction of the stream above mentioned with the Zab. Below this point there is an impassable gorge, through which the Zab flows for 10 m. until it reaches the Sipena valley. There is a ford at Aqri, apparently about -g- m. down-stream, 100 yds. wide, passable in early autumn. If the bridge at m. 13 has not been rebuilt, it might be necessary to use this ford.

For summer route to Van Marwanen see Route 79. See also Route 68 a, m. 99^. From Heyis a summer mule-track to Kocliannes branches off to 1. It apparently goes by Ashita in the Berwari district, and thence rises to the divide between the Zab and Khabur rivers (alt. up to 10,000 ft.). The divide is followed until a turn to E. leads to the headwaters of the Selai and Kliananis (about 30 hrs.' march ing from Heyis). From Khananis to Kochannes the distance is 9-10 m., over a bad track. A branch from this route apparently leads down E. from the divide into Iiewin valley, and eventually reaches Julamerk. Follow r. bank until stream meets a small tributary flowing from E. (alt. 3,900 ft.). Ascend to a stony plateau, with an oak forest on it farther E. Track leaves the watershed of the Khabur Su and a zigzag descends to the headwaters of a stream flowing into the Zab, crosses it, and also crosses a low spur, Duri (alt. about 4,600 ft.). This is the residence of the Nestorian bishop of the Berwari district: it lies in a fertile valley down which is the large Jewish village of Shimarileh. Eoad goes up a side valley past vineyards on 1, and a wooded hill on r., rising by a steep, narrow zigzag path over a wooded range of heights, sometimes impassable for laden animals as late as March, on account of snow. This range forms the N. boundary of the Berwari district. Pass through Maidani, situated at the head of a tributary of the Zab and follow the stream for 1^ m. Zeri (alt. 3,300 ft.), an important Nestorian village on the S. edge of the Ashiret country. N. of this the country136 Miles from Ama- diyeh 28 LAND ROUTES becomes much more rugged and contains little timber or cultivation. From this point a track leads to a ford across the Zab, at a point where it is 100 yds. wide (November). This ford is about 2 m. below the point where the main route leaves the Zab for Berawola (m. 32|). Another track leads to Julamerk going E. down to the Zab where it joins 68 a at m. 13. The track now becomes very difficult, and continues to be so as far as Julamerk : it is passable only for lightly laden animals. Ascend to N. through a forest, cross a steep, stony ridge (alt. 4,050 ft.), by a zigzag, and descend a hill-side, passing through a wood, to the Zab. Follow r. bank of the river up-stream. Lizan (alt. 2,900 ft.), Nestorian village of 200 houses, situated on a wooded hill-side just above the Zab and surrounded by much terraced cultivation. Route crosses the Zab by a ford, or by a badly-constructed bridge of wooden beams laid on stone piers, impassable for laden mules in 1911. From Lizan two tracks branch to N., both being fit for foot travellers only :— (i) To Julamerk along r. bank of the Zdb. This is a footpath, passable by porters only. For a ^-hrs.' march follow the r. bank of the Zab by a very dangerous track to Mar Siwa, a small village of scattered houses, near which the hill-sides are clothed with some fine walnut trees. From here continue along the river, which has to be crossed occasionally by bridges. It is an 8-hrs. ? march to the village of Dirawa. The country traversed on these two marches is very thinly populated ; only millets are produced. The path is so narrow that, in most places, two men cannot walk abreast. During the winter and spring this part of the route is rendered unsafe by snow avalanches, and another track has to be followed, which lies some three or four thousand feet above the river. From Dirawa to Julamerk, a 10-hrs. ? march, the track is much better and is practicable for lightly laden mules : it follows the r. bank of the Zab, here about 60 yds. wide in April, until it meets Route 68 a at m. 60^. (ii) To Route 68 a at m. 31^. After crossing the Lizan bridge the track follows the 1. bank of the Zab up-stream, the river being 120 yds. wide in the summer, at this part of the route. About 3 m. beyond the bridge a canon is entered which is 20 yds. wide at the narrowest point and about 0 'it $ROUTE 68 b 137 Miles from Ama- diyeh 82i 35i? 37 40i i m. long : here the track follows a causeway a few feet above the water level. It then ascends a s 100 yds. in length, follows the edge of a ravine to E. along a narrow ledge of rock for about 400 yds., crosses the ravine and follows its other or r. bank back to the river. Beyond this it goes along the edge of the precipice by a very narrow and dangerous path, crosses a spur and descends again to the Zab at the Nestorian village of Bitoannis (Bes lonnis?), at 4 m. It then crosses the Qara Su, crosses a ridge and descends to a wicker-bridge over the Zab at 5 m. From this bridge it ascends by a badly-defined track, crosses a flat-topped spur, descends by zig zags a debris-covered slope to the village of Chumbi de Susina. at 6i m. ; 20 houses with good cultivation. From here the track, passing a valley from WSW., crosses a very difficult 300 yds. long, and at 7 m. meets 68 a at m, Sl^. After crossing the Lizan bridge descend 1. bank of the Zab ; follow the W. foot of the Gargarri Dagh. and turn up the valley of the Tkhuma stream. There is no defined track, and the sides of the valley are so steep that in many places the bed of the stream has to be followed. Going very bad, a traveller finding it necessary, in 1911, to unload his mules in places, possibly because they were too heavily laden for this rough country. Berawola (alt. 2,950 ft.), 40 houses to N. Continue to ascend the Tkhuma valley, direction NE. Salebekkan, a long, straggling village (see lloute 68a, m. 21). Cross Itoute 68 a. The stream is of considerable size, and the valley, here about 200 yds. wide, produces a good deal of wheat, rice, and millet, containing moreover many fruit and poplar trees. This is the Tkhuma district of the Ashiret country, the other part being Tiari, N. of Lizan. The Tkhuma men are said to be more reliable and less quarrelsome than those of Tiari, although these last have the better manners. The valley has a bad reputation for brigandage, according to one authority ; and the inhabitants have a standing feud with the Kurdish residents of the Chal valley, to S. Continue up the valley along the bottom. Malik Belcho, a large village. Continue up the valley, which widens as it turns N. Cross to 1. bank of the stream. Koad becomes easier. Cross the stream again. Beridjai village, beyond which the valley bends sharply to E.138 LAND ROUTES Miles from Ama- diyeh 46 51^ 53-| 56 57i 61 70 Road becomes very bad as it follows the bed of the stream over stones and boulders. Pass several villages of which the most important is Tkhuma Gawaia, situated above the r. bank, the residence of Malik Belcho, the local head of the Nestorians in 1904. The valley is broad, and both sides are cultivated, with fields, vine yards, and mulberry trees on them. Gundiktha (alt. 5,500 ft ). Valley again turns N. Follow the bed of the stream through a deep rocky valley with the Qara Dagh on the E. and the Walto Dagh on the W. On the former snow lies late in summer, from which numerous small streams descend, some of which are bridged with single arches of loose stone masonry. ' Track turns N. following the sti*eam for some 4 m., beyond which it goes up the hill to r. Hani (alt. about 8,500 ft.), a small village whose inhabitants are occupied mainly in the neighbouring lead mines. Ascend steeply. Hani pass, or Zoch Gedik (alt. about 10,800 ft.), whence, to NE., are seen the Jelu peaks (alt. about 13,000 ft.), some of the highest mountains in central Kurdistan. Continue to N. across a broad conglomerate ridge, then descend steeply by a narrow path into a broad valley. Rabat, Kurdish village, on the Rabat Su, a tributary of the Zab: this is the main stream of the Tal district. The valley is wide and well cultivated ; there are trees. Continue down the valley. Bekurat. Valley narrows. Road crosses to r. bank of the stream. Between this place and the Zab the road was carried away in 1904-5, and Julamerk had to be reached Badali, high up on the r. bank, by a most difficult path, impass able for animals. Continue down the valley by a very bad track, running generally at some height above the stream, the stream being crossed more than once. Zab valley.

Authorities :—Military Beport onE.T.A., vol. iii, Route 120, supplemented from other information. General direction, NNE. The road follows the r. bank of the Great Zab river, fairly low clown the hill-side. This is the main route from Julamerk to Bash Qal'ah, and is that generally followed by travellers, although the road Kochannes and the Harefta Gedik {Boutes 70 and 71 a), 1 m. shorter but having many more severe ascents and descents, is sometimes used. For the tirst 36 miles it is a fairly good mule-road, passable at all times of the year, except for the stretch between m. 20^ and m. 32, which is not used during the winter when a lower road, 4 m. longer, is followed. Beyond m. 36 it is shown on the W.O. map as a cart-track, and probably could be used by wheeled traffic without much difficulty. There is some difficulty about fuel along this route, and for a large body of men it would be necessary to cut down fruit trees, of which a fair number is available. On the population, compare p. 32. Miles from J ula- merk o 93 Z 4 6a 4 91 Julamerk. The route crosses the Julamerk basin and descends into a valley partly along a ledge in loose shale and partly over rock : the track is revetted in places. Erik Hald, Kurdish village of a few huts with some rice fields lying on the r. bank of the Zab. Follow a narrow, rocky track along the river. Marora, small tributary of the Zab. From this point up to Rezan de Zab (m. 21), the intermediate distances must be accepted with caution as there is clearly some confusion in the principal authority. The track, follow ing the river, becomes bad. Des Chai, a large stream flowing into the Zab on the 1. bank. It comes from the Jelu district. Near its junction with the Zab lies the village of Kermi de Des or Rezan (de Des) dominated by the ruins of an old Kurdish stronghold, Mudebbir Qal'ah. Down this valley comes a route from Neri (see Route 63 a, m. 91^) which crosses140 LAND ROUTES Miles from Jula- merk the Zab here both by a bridge and a ford, eoins? im fho hill to 1. to Kochannes. 6 P me The track becomes so bad that in June when the river was about 2i ft. deep mules crossed and re-crossed the stream in order to avoid a narrow ledge along the r. bank which, in 1901, had fallen away in places. 14A Kochannes Chai, a large stream flowing into the Zab on r. bank. A very rough track, passable for laden mules, leads up the Kochannes Chai for about 1 m. until it meets 71 a (Kochannes— Bash Qal'ah). For the importance of this track in winter see 71 a introduction. Continue along the river bank or sometimes in the river itself, which is here 40 ft. to 50 ft. wide, not fordable in March. Leaving the Zab at an altitude of 4,650 ft. the road ascends a narrow stony ravine. Alternative route to Zerani (m. 32, below). About here the winter route to Bash Qal'ah branches off to r. follow ing the river bank past Hezekian and rejoining the main route at Zerani (see m. 32), being about 4 m. longer than the main route and an extremely rough and difficult track. In the spring this route is sometimes so much exposed to avalanches between here and Hezekian that another track is followed through Rezan which crosses a lidge some 7,000 ft. high before reaching Hezekian, About J m. beyond the bifurcation of the winter and summer routes there is a ford over the Zab leading to Dizeh via Shawutha, where it joins Route 64. Rezan (de Zab), a Nestorian village of 10 houses. From Rezan on to Bash QaVah the hills are bare for the most part, and are torn into deep gorges by snow-water torrents, villages standing on any little shelves there may be. The rock is usually a slatey limestone, splitting readily into flakes and tilted at every conceivable angle. N. of the Qara Su a good deal of rather poor grazing can be had in the spring. After leaving Kezan a small stream from 1. is crossed, at the head of which are the Nestorian villages of Napetka and Pirrianis lying among trees and cultivation. The small Kurdish villages of Erdal, Weisik, and MTato- lanis are seen across the Zab.

The Masero stream142 LAND KOUTES Miles from J nla - merk 32 35i 36i 37 38i m coming from the Mur Dagh is visible across the Zab, with several Kurdish villages in its valley. Zerani (alt. 5,850 ft.), a village of 15 houses where good spring water, fuel, and some supplies are available. For alternative winter route which joins here from Julamerk, see m. 20^, above. Leaving Zerani the road crosses two small streams. Koute traverses a basin surrounded by clay spurs, one of which it crosses, and, passing some chalybeate springs (from which it is 45 min. to Zerani), goes by an easy track over a high rounded spur. Qara Su, a large stream in a deep gorge, which is crossed. Reach the banks of the Zab (alt. 5,550 ft.), here 30 to 40 yds. wide and 2| ft. deep in September, the r. bank being followed by a fairly good track above the Zab, here a deep sluggish stream winding through a grassy valley. The track now ascends gradually. Cross a broad spur coming down from the W., and jutting out into a bend of the Zab. From the bottom of the descent from the spur the road is shown on the W.

On the opposite side of the Zab Atis, 100 houses, and Argi, a Nestorian village of 80 houses, are seen, villages situated on a wide cultivated plateau at the foot of the Mur Dagh (Surian Dagh ?). A small grassy valley with a stream in it is passed, leaving Sinawa 1 m. to 1. Cross the Seriskan Su, a stream 30 ft. wide and 2 ft. deep in September, with a gravel bottom, flowing through a valley sunk in the plateau. On its N. bank to r. are some sulphur springs. Katib Agha, 60 houses, is ^ m. to 1., and Hekan, a larger Kurdish village, 2 m. to 1.

The route descends towards the banks of the Great Zab, and then strikes NE. to the Harefta Gedik (alt. 10,210 ft. ), which it crosses. It keeps along theW. side of the Great Zab at some distance from the river. This road is often used by travellers going in the summer from Bash Qal'ah to Julamerk, being cool and fairly easy, with plenty of water along it. It passes through a fair number of villages. It is closed by snow during the winter, when it is necessary to descend to the Zab valley by the track men tioned under m. 5, and reach Bash Qal'ah by (m. 14-|—end).

The road goes from the basin of the Bohtan Su to that of the Great Zab, crossing the Geshkalin pass (alt. 11,650 ft.) at the divide of these two rivers. It passes through a treeless, fairly well-watered country, almost uninhabited save by nomad Kurds in the spring and summer, when there is excellent grazing. It is passable for laden mules in the summer, but is closed to all traffic by snow during the winter. On the Nestorian and Armenian population, compare p. 32. Miles from Sekunis o 4 6| 94 13 Sekunis.

General direction, NW. This route goes from the valley of the Great Zab over Chukh Dagh into the basin of Lake Van, following the Khoshab Su to Van. It is more or less practicable for wheeled traffic throughout. Near Bash Qal'ah, Khoshab and Van there is a good deal of cultivation, but fuel is very scarce throughout, and grazing is poor: for 10 m. W. of Chukh there is no grazing at all. The Chukh Gedik is a particularly dangerous pass from the climatic point of view, and is impassable for animals during the winter and often till late in the spring. On the Nestorian and Armenian population, compare p. 32. Miles from Bash 0 Bash Qalah (alt. 7,275 ft.). After leaving the town the foot of the Valitan Dagh is skirted by a broad easy track to N., trending to E., which passes Kharabeh, a village m. to r. ? situated on the edge of a ravine, and Alaniyeh (50 Armenian and Kurdish houses, formerly a Nestorian village), in a basin among the hills ^ m. to l. ? where in June there is good pasture for mules. (It is about 50 min. from Alaniyeh to Bash Qal ah.) The route then crosses a small stream, skirts the foot of some steep hills ^ m. to L, passes a ruined fort on a spur to 1., crosses a shallow dip forming the head of a ravine going to the Zab, and leaves Srisan, a large village, with the castle of a Kurdish Bey, 1 m. to r.154 Miles from Bash Qarah 4 10 13i 14 m 19 m LAND EOUTES Junction of the road from Dilman to Bash Qalah which comes in from the NE.

(See Route 74 b, m. 14^.) Pass Chukh, 50 Armenian houses on 1., on the S. bank of the stream. The valley opens out, with bare rounded hills on either side. The track, which goes over stony clay, continues to be easy, until a steep ascent is made by zigzags. Small khan at summit of steep ascent. There is here an outpost of zajotiehs. Beyond this khan an easy ascent by a small stream in a shallow valley leads to Chukh Gredik (alt. 9,100 ft.), a pass over the Chukh Dagh, a range of hills running NE.-SW. This range, bare of all vegetation, is noted for the severity of its cold blizzards and for the depth of its snowfall: the snow lies so late on it that the pass is never open for laden animals until the middle of April, and has actually been closed to them so late as the end of May. Tracks lead to Shushlamerg down the Guzel Dereh. The cart-road, partly remetalled in 1900, descends easily, but is rather steep in places. It follows a broad clay spur ^ between two deep ravines. Khan (alt. about 7,000 ft.) at the junction of several small sti earns. Gradual descent by a gravelly track. Ravine (alt. 7,500 ft.) in gravel and shale on r. at the foot of the Chukh Gedik.

It goes down si small stream to 1. into a wide valley, where it is joined by the track from Shushlamerg, which lies below and to 1. of the route. (See Boute 74 b, m. 20^.) Skeftan, small Kurd village, out of sight 2 m. to 1., situated on a large stream flowing from the SE. which emerges through a narrow gorge and joins the stream flowing down the valley followed by the road. This stream now runs in a broad gravelly channel easily fordable except in the spring. There is a mule-track on the 1. bank. Eoute follows this stream and leaves on the E. some ravines, and on the W. some rough tracks leading up a side valley to Qasriq. (See 72, m. 53^.) Khoshab, situated on both sides of the stream. TO. Head-quarters of the Kaimmakam of the Hamldiyeh or Khoshab Kam. Fine ruins of an old castle on the r. bank, and a good masonry bridge of one 12-ft. and two 25-ft. spans. In June the drinking water is bad. (For other routes from Khoshab, see 74 b and 78.) Route crosses to the 1. bank, which it follows by a somewhat rough track, winding past several small ravines and passing above a gorge at the junction of a large stream coming from Kolan to NE. Route now lies some m. above the Khoshab Su, whose valley is open with steep clay slopes traversed by numerous ravines. Ascend by an easy track and pass over a broad col whence a good view is obtained of Khoshab and its valley. Turn down a broad side valley in which is met a road from Serai to Qasriq. Enter the main valley, bounded on the N. by uncultivated treeless hills with numerous ravines. Pass the mouth of a rough valley, going S., up which runs a mule-track to join the Serai-Qasriq road. Farther on track follows a stony ledge for 300 yds. close above a bend of the stream. To avoid this, and unless the track be widened, carts must ford the river. Here the valley is about m. wide with low rounded hills on either hand. The track is easy and continues along 1. bank, through clay. Golen Katun, where there is a ruined khan. Cross the stream by a bridge consisting of a single 40-ft. stone156 LAND ROUTES arch, over which it seems that flood-water passes, the roadway being much worn in 1900, when the bridge was in bad repair. Its use can be avoided, when the river is not in flood, by an easy ford with good approaches, some 50 yds. above it. Beyond the bridge a short and rather steep ascent leads to a rocky ledge, which to fit it for wheeled traffic requires widening and levelling in places. Hence there is a descent leading to a rocky defile 50 ft. lower, the stream passing through a gorge on 1. Zernak, Kurdish village of some 30 houses, on 1. bank, dominated by remains of a castle, situated at the mouth of a rocky ravine and surrounded by a few trees and gardens. A mule-track runs up the Zernak valley to the road leading from Serai to Pagha Gedik and Qasriq. Farther on the valley is 400 yds. wide with 200 yds. of shingle and shrubs and brushwood along its banks, thi'ough which flows the Khoshab Chai, easily fordable except in the spring, when the rush of water is very great. Route leads past low hills closing in from N. and crossing the wide shingly bed of a stream at the mouth of a deep valley running NE., whose sides are intersected with numerous small ravines.

There are some patches of cultivation in the valley, which narrows as the road ascends it, until it becomes a gorge above which the road passes high up on r. bank. Beyond this place the stream is crossed and another gorge is avoided by the road ascending high up the hill-side on 1. bank, above which the road again crosses to r. bank. Narrow, stony valley coming down from NW. A narrow track alongside the stream is followed, with steep clay slopes on either hand, the volume of water in the stream decreasing rapidly as its bed is ascended.

This is shown on the W.O. map as passable for wheeled traffic, and it may be that light vehicles could be taken over it before the war. It goes W. from the pass which lies W. of Razi (see Eoute 76 a at m. 69) and crosses the Chul Chemen plain to Seivan and Van. It is 41 m. in length as compared with 56 m., the length of the driving road (Route 76 a). There is good grazing along it, and water is plentiful. The distances are taken from the W.O. route book, and differ considerably from those given on the W.O. map.

No detailed description of the latter is available, but since it is said to pass over a succession of rolling downs probably it could be made into a cart-track without much difficulty, if it is not one now. The former road is described below: it is passable for wheeled traffic for the last 10 m. or less before reaching Serai.

A steep descent leads down a ravine to Challek (Chelki ; alt. 3,000 ft.), a Nestorian village on the Khabur Su, which is crossed by a wicker bridge, the stream being swift and deep with a difficult ford : there is a raft ferry at Begovi about 1 m. down-stream. An extremely steep ascent leads from the bridge to the site of an ancient city, Binyamin Qalah, whence the road traverses an oak forest for 2-| m., ascends a side ravine, crosses a spur and descends into a deep ravine at Busi, situated on the banks of the river. The valley is ascended by a track cut in the rock to the junction of the Vaktori Chai, and the track continues to follow the bank of the river by a difficult path to Nuzur, whence a footpath is said to lead up the valley to Marwanen via Hadrish, a large Kurdish village. The route here followed leaves the river, and for the next 20 miles traverses the valley high up in a N. direction, along the Tannin Dagh. It ascends a wooded side ravine, past some rice fields, by a track so narrow and bad that laden mules can scarcely pass along it, to Suli (alt. 4, 500 ft.). The track continues up the ravine, being very steep and rocky. From the top of the ascent it /turns to E. over a high ridge, skirts another deep ravine, crosses a second ridge and descends steeply to Margi (4,050 ft.), situated in a more open valley.

Via S heenakh and K humaea Authority;—Military Report on E. T.A.. vol. iii, Routes 180, 130 a (reports of 1888 and 1900). General direction, NE. This route ascends the E. divide of the Rohsur Su, rounds the S. end of the Shernakh Dagh, crosses the head waters of the Hazil Su, and then passes into the basin of the Bohtan Su. In combination with Route 81 a or 81 b, it furnishes through routes from Jezlret-ibn-'Omar to Van, 1381 and 143i m. in length respectively. The first 72 m. combined with 82 and 79 provide a route of 173 m. to Van : this last is more or less suitable for wheeled traffic, and is probably the easiest of the three. It was reported in 1888 that if this road could be made to carry wheeled traffic it would form a good line of communication between Jezlret-ibn-'Omar and Van. It would, however, be liable to be blocked in places in spring. Although it traverses very rough country through mountains the whole way, it might be made passable for carts by widening and levelling in places. In 1888 and 1900 between Jeziret- ibn-'Omar and Khumara (m. 94) it needed such improvement in places : it was quite impracticable for wheeled traffic beyond m. 94, but the construction of a cart-road had been spoken of. Blasting would be required, but in many cases the rock is loose shale, where cutting would be easy. The country traversed is sparsely populated, and most of the inhabitants are nomads. There is plenty of water, good grazing, and a fair amount of fuel, but hardly any other supplies. On the Nestorian and Armenian population, compare p. 82.

The ascent at first is rough and stony, but after the summit is reached there is not much difficulty. It was said that a good road could be improvised in a short time on this line. It passes through fairly wooded country. The W.O. map of 1901 shows this track as practicable for wheeled traffic. Nurdush. Su (alt. 1,450 ft.), which emerges from a rocky gorge to N. Cross by a stone bridge of 40-ft. span and turn up the 1. bank by a narrow track through irrigated cultivation and fruit gardens. Almonds, figs, walnuts, mulberries, olives, vines, and pomegranates are grown, and wheat, Indian corn, tobacco, melons, beans, cotton, and other crops on the higher slopes. The opposite bank of the Nurdush Su is a bare rocky cliff rising some 1,500 ft. Shakh (alt. 1,960 ft.), 230 houses of Hartoshi Kurds, and 30 of Nestorians, situated at the end of a rocky spur 400 ft. above the stream.

A few huts at the mouth of a gorge on r. Pir-i-Ghelli (alt. 1,910 ft.). Ford the stream. In 1888 the bridge had lately been destroyed, and unless it has been rebuilt this route is practically impassable. Beyond the bridge the route follows a 2-ft. zigzag track *up a stony hill-side. The valley bends sharply to E. and the track becomes easier, passing through a wood of oak, sycamore, and ash trees. A foot-track branches off here over the hill to the N. to join the alternative track from Serau (see note at m. 5^ above). QaVali Baginuk on the hills to W. and Qal'ali Kelhuk on the E. are the remains of forts placed to bar the passage down the pass. They are now of little value. The valley narrows to 30 yds., and a narrow difficult ledge is followed round some jutting spurs. This is a pass known as the Tang-i- Ghelli. The valley opens out, the track becomes easy. To SE. the Judi Dagh is visible, thickly covered with oaks.LAND ROUTES Chemislitm (alt. 2,400 ft.), an open space by the river suitable for camping. The direct hill-track from Serau (see note under m. 5i) joins the present track here. On the opposite side of the valley is a high ridge with bare cliffs. To SW. is the Tang-i-Qasr Ghelli, through which the nohsur Su passes to the Tigris. A route which appears to be fairly easy and is much used by nomads leads up the Rohsur valley by Derguleh (see immediately below), then over a broad easy col in the ShernaMi Dagh (m. 84) and along the middle slope of the Harakol Dagh. (see under m. 40). To NW. is a broad wooded valley down which a large tributary comes to join the Eohsur from Khundukh, There is an extensive view in that direction and a track leads to the ruined fort and village of Derguleh, 4 m. distant. The district of Derguleh in 1888 was under populated though fertile. The large Christian population had been exterminated in the earlier half of last century. To N. is the Chiraf Dagh, a curious peak with steep pre cipitous sides, overhanging the Eohsur and forming a western spur of the Shernakh Dagh (see below, m. 34). Khundukh lies on the N. side of this peak. The route now follows an easy clay track along the r. bank of the stream, passing a few patches of cultivation. Leave the stream and skirt a conical mound on which stands the Nestorian village of Sigirik. The country is well wooded with oaks, hawthorns, and junipers. An out crop of coal, probably of poor quality, is passed, and a long gradual ascent over wooded cultivated country leads to Shernakh (alt. 4,650 ft.), a Kurdish centre of some impor tance, containing 400 Kurdish and 30 Nestorian houses, the residence of the Chief of the Shernakhi Kurds, who are asMret, are not nomads, and are favourably disposed towards Christians.

Descend a narrow spur into the next valley by a very steep track in loose shale through which zigzags could easily be made to improve the descent. Enter a valley 150 yds. wide with steep shale slopes, and cross a stream 30 ft. wide and 1 ft. deep in June (alt. 3,670 ft.). The stream rises in a wooded hill with a rounded summit 4 m. to N. Haiuidi Bashi is a flat-topped hill some 4 m. to SE. Follow the bank of the stream, crossing and recrossing. The valley seems to be entirely filled with water during floods. Climb a spur (alt. 4,645 ft.) and keep along a path with deep valleys on either side, descending gradually through wooded country into a deep valley. Cross a stream (alt. 3,890 ft.) 40 ft. wide and 18 in. deep in June, flowing in a bed of scattered boulders 300 yds. wide. It runs round the base of the flat-topped hill to SE. The track goes through groves of oaks and sycamores, following the bank of the stream, up which tracks also run to Chemikinianis Maidan (9 m. distant), the summer pasture of the Miran Kurds, and to Haishat at the junction of the Maslro Chai and Bohtan Su (16 m. distant). Climb another ridge in soft shale (alt. 4,680 ft.). Descend easily to the Bustasar Chai (alt. 4,475 ft.), a stream flowing S. Near by is the junction of a small tributary which the track follows E. Pass an open camping-ground, called Bustasar (alt. 4,530ft.), about -I m. square, surrounded by trees. Follow the 1. bank of the tributary of the main stream : the valley narrows gradually ; several thickly wooded side-valleys are passed. Valley bifurcates, the track following the SE. branch. Summit of a spur (alt. 5,180 ft.). To the N., 11 m. distant, is the Awrakh or Bvrak Dagh, an isolated rocky peak which can be ascended only from the S. It lies at the NW. end of the Dahazir Dagh (m. 77 below), which in that direction is called Beriderria.KOUTE 80 179 Miles from Jeziret- ibn- Omar 72 77 78 To the S., 4 m. distant, is a high range called Kala Mami, the summits thickly covered with snow in July. The upper slopes are rounded and grassy, while the lower are steep cliffs overhanging a stream which flows along the N. face to join the Hazil. The southernmost peak is Zawarra Mami. The country SE. of Zawarra Mami with the Tannin Dagh overlooks the Khabur gorge. Between the Dahazir Dagh and Kala Mami is a deep gap with a col forming the watershed between the Khabur and the Hazil. A ruined castle marks the top of the col, and a track leads over it to Beit esh-Shebab (see Route 79, m. 75^), but the descent on the E. side is very difficult and steep. Mahri Nar is another peak to the S. of Zawarra Mami overlooking the Hazil gorge. All these mountains rise to about 11,000 ft. They are the summer pastures of the Shir Nakhli, Goyan, and Zishirlki Kurds. Wind along a wooded spur with numerous V-shaped ravines on either side. Excellent grass in June soil a rich black loam. Easy track with steady ascent. About half-way up the spur track bifurcates, the present route turning NE., the other branch going on to Shiv Shalil (see Route 79, m. 88, and Ro 82).

Over looking the gorge are the ruins of an old Kurdish stronghold known as Jengir Qalah. Track easy over undulating clay hills. On the rocky, wall-like ridge f m. to 1. are the ruins of an old castle called Qal'ah. Berkhi. In the valley to the W. are the ruins of Haishat, an Armenian village not to be confused with Haishat, a large thriving village (1900) further N. near the junction of the Maslro with the Bohtan Su (see under m. 94 below). Only rough difficult paths lead into the Bohtan valley about Haishat. Fine view to W., showing the whole of the Hazil basin, with the crags of Harakol (m. 40 above) to N., the Shernakh Dagh to W.

Fine view to W. over all the Hazil basin, bounded by the lofty rounded masses of Qal'ah Mami and the Tannin Dagh on the S. (see m. 69 above). A well-defined track, probably passable for wheels with little difficulty, leads NW. under the Awrakh Dagh (see m. 69) near Chemi- kinianis, and is used as the main route by the Miran Kurds migrating to JezTret-ibn-'Omar for the winter. To E. there is an extensive view over the Kavalis district and a sea of rounded mountains bordering the Maslro stream, known in its upper portion as the Shahbur. Present track now trends E. Path easy and well-defined among low hills. Descend rather more steeply into the wide basin of the Maslro stream, now below to the E. Track very rough and stony for ^ m. following a small ravine. It might be improved for wheels. Cross a broad, stony valley from the SE. with a dry stream- bed and wind along the base of a broad spur to r.

Beyond the rift is the Ghelli-i-Bairau plain. Just below the ford the stream enters some lime stone strata through which it winds in a narrow gorge with steep, wooded slopes, and further down it enters the Tang-i-Balian, a huge rift with the sheer slope of Awrakh on one side and cliffs 1,500 ft. high on the other. Through this it makes its way to the Bohtan Su above Haishat. Only difficult paths lead down the ravine. The present track turns sharply NW. towards the gorge, ascends above the rocky level, and becomes an easy track used by nomads and well-worn. Soil a shaley clay. Wind round the head of a tributary ravine with stream from the r. The craggy gorge to 1. is wooded with junipers and oaks. In the gorge under Awrakh are some patches of cultivation and the ruins of the small Armenian village of Hul. A few Armenian villages used to exist here, but by 1900 they had been destroyed by the Miran Kurds, and the country was depopulated except for their sheep pasturage in summer. Wind round another ravine from the r., track broad and easy for wheels. Leave the Masiro and follow a minor stream from the NE. in a narrow gorge to 1. A broad, well-worn track branches over low hills E. towards the valley of the Yazdinan Su and Kavalis district, along the upper Masiro. From Yazdinan a hill-track leads to Nurduz and Merwanen. This is a much more difficult track than Boutes 82 and 83. Upper slopes along the track now quite bare. A few junipers lower down. End of rocky gorge to 1. Valley opens, with slopes of shaley clay. Track rough and stony in places, but could be made passable for wheels. Begin long gradual ascent of high ridge in front, dotted with a few huts of Tayan Kurds who are here from June to the middle of September.

To SE. the summit is grassy and rounded, forming the water shed between the Maslro and the Yazdinan, and joining the Nurdtlz hills above Merwanen. On the N. view to the Arnost Dagh, on which the Miran Kurds graze their flocks in the summer, and to high ranges beyond the Bohtan. Descend by a steep but easy clay track towards the Bohtan valley in front. Several minor tracks join from Kavalis to the SE. Round a grassy valley (alt. 7,100 ft.), the head of a stream going N. to the Bohtan in a rocky gorge. A line of crags to W. of the valley. Some junipers now on the slopes. Cross a broad spur and descend into another valley, also running to the Bohtan, but smaller than the last, with easy grassy slopes. Descend more steeply but by broad, well-defined track. Khumara (alt. 5,030 ft.), 15 Armenian houses in a small cultivated basin overlooking the deep, narrow valley of the Bohtan Su, which is here a rushing mountain torrent over a bed of boulders. The climate in this region is very equable and the soil extremely fertile, but the depredations of nomad Kurds prevent any development. A small post of soldiers is kept at Khumara in summer (1900) to restrain the Khalllan Kurds who live down the valley on the 1. bank. The Khalllan are a small tribe, but noted robbers. On the far bank of the Bohtan, opposite Khumara, the slopes are very precipitous, culminating in a cliff 1,500 ft. high and quite impassable. Lower down on the r. bank are very steep valleys in which are the small Armenian villages of Shakavientz, Ari, Sarkat, and Ermishat, with terraced cultivation on the mountain side. On the 1. bank are the villages of the Khalllan Kurds, and the country there is thickly wooded with low oaks and crossed by several deep ravines.ROUTE 80 183 spots Miles from Jeziret- ibn- Omar SE, ^ter ming liran high )htan mlis Mm tie of a the with irrent ion is it the mm® rathe triH i, the 500 ft' ffhicii , M on the 95i 96 96| Haishat, a large Armenian village, is visible some distance down, with extensive orchards and gardens, near the junction of the Maslro with the Bohtan (see m. 78 above). A rough track leads down the 1. bank of the Bohtan to Sairt via Khoskheir. Present track winds round wooded spur and begins descent towards the riyer. From here to Shattakh it was quite impassable for wheels in 1900, but the construction of a cart-track was spoken of. Wind round wooded spur and commence descent towards river. Stony ravines down to the river, the slopes thickly wooded with oaks. Cross a sharp spur and begin steep descent of a stony, clay slope. Sheer cliff rising 1,000 ft. on the far bank.

Reach the river-level close to 1. bank. Slopes very steep. River 50 yds. broad in August, and unfordable, a rapid torrent among boulders. Path is a stony mule-track close to the water among trees. Junction of the Yazdinan Chai with the Bohtan Su. The Yazdinan Chai is a large stream from the S., its lower course being through a narrow gorge, through which runs a difficult path. Steep pinnacled cliffs on either side which form an immense rocky wall on the N. 600 yds. above the junction is a masonry bridge of one 25-ft. span. The abutment next the r. bank was in 1900 much worn away by floods. When the river is low the track follows the Bohtan, fording the Yazdinan at the junction; but to reach the bridge a steep, rough track over a wooded spur has to be followed. Present road follows the Bohtan by a narrow track, close to the stream, along a steep, wooded slope, sometimes a rocky ledge and at others across loose shale and stones from above. Avalanches are common'when the snows are melting, and the track is partly swept away in spring. Track dangerous even in summer. Round a rocky spur, following a narrow ledge over the water for 30 yds.

Steep paths from the river to the village. Wind round the face of a rocky cliff projecting into the stream by a narrow ledge cut in steps. Below the cliff is a deep ford over a gravelly- bed, passable in late summer. There is also a rough, wicker footbridge, often washed away by floods. A track leads from Gechid high up along the hill-side to Lishan (see below under m. 97), thence to the Bohtan near Sakh Dereh (see below under m. 100), and so to Shattakh. Cross mouth of a steep stony valley from r. with a small stream known as the Khiziz Dereh. At the head of the valley is a rocky impracticable country filling in the angle between the Bohtan and Yazdinan. After a short distance reach a place where the ledge in the loose shale had in 1900 been widened by cutting to 2 ft. A good track could be improvised. Pass mouth of steep rocky ravine to 1., high up which is Lishan, 15 Armenian houses, among orchards and terraces.

The road goes up the Shattakh stream to NE., crosses the high-lying plain of Gurandesht and thence descends into the Khoshab Su valley. It crosses the stream and follows the shore of Lake Van to Van. This is a good road for mules and in parts is suitable for wheeled traffic, although it does not appear to be a cart-track throughout, as it is shown on the W.O. map of 1901. From m. 5 to m. 12 it is subject to avalanches in the spring. Fuel can be obtained on the first part of the route, but it is scarce farther towards the N.

The route, which lies through mountainous country, is one of the main lines of communication between Mesopotamia and the North. From Jezlret-ibn-'Omar to Sairt the route in 1888 was impassable for wheels. As far as m. 12 the road was easy, but beyond that point the track was often rocky and difficult and steep ascents and descents were encountered. At m. 53 the Bohtan Su has to be crossed. It is fordable only in the low ; water season, and the bridge in the neighbourhood was in ruins in 1888. Beyond Sairt, a projected chaussee, completed for 3 m., was reported in 1888, and the route to Ziyaret Wa'iz el-Qur'ani seems to have then been passable for guns. At Ziyaret Wa'iz el-Qur'ani the Diarbekr— Bitlis chaussee was struck. This, not yet metalled in 1888, was still incomplete in 1899. Work was apparently going on upon it in 1913. It ascends the r. bank of the Bitlis Su. The route described below does not follow the chaussee throughout, as for some distance above the Charpiran bridge it runs along the left bank. Several bridges were found in 1899 in the valley of the Bitlis Su, but most of them were in bad repair. The streams on the route are generally fordable in places except in flood-time. Water is generally plentiful, but at Sairt there is often a deficiency in summer, and some of the wells are contaminated and slightly brackish. Fuel is usually plentiful. No considerable quantity of supplies could be expected en route.Miles from Jeziret- ibn- f Omar o 4i 2 ition lates ^2' litlis 71 ' 2 cent 9 ;pre- ' the )rth. lable 1 -5 that 15 and o be 17 ■idge )rted then kr- 20^ still it in .lUtJU ;ance yeral most rally 23 ency Atly tyof ROUTE 86 (5) 193 MES. IV Jeziret-ibn- Omar. After crossing the boat bridge the route turns 1. by an indifferent track on the 1. bank of the Tigris, skirting the shingly bed of the river and leading to Mansuriyeh, a Christian village of 20-40 houses. A high rocky ridge approaches to the E. Ford the Rohsur Su, a large stream, a torrent in spring, but in September only 30 ft. wide and 8 in. deep, in a gravelly bed 200 yds. wide. A track leads up its gorge to Derguleh and Shernakh, and up this valley, according to some authorities, Xenophon led the Ten Thousand Greeks after a successful action at Mansuriyeh. Continue to follow the Tigris. Deran, village with orchards. Shingle island in river at low water. Pinuk, Kurd village, built round the mouth of a gorge in a rocky ridge, 1 m. to r. Cave dwellings; extensive orchards ; ruins of several castles overlooking the Tigris. Near Finuk are bas-reliefs of the Parthian period on the rocks. The track is easy, passing some water-courses. Leave the river (see below under Fanduq, m. 23). Steep descent into and ascent from a rocky ravine with a stream in it. Passing the ruins of an old Kurd castle the path ascends a high ridge by a difficult rocky path. Alt. 2,010 ft. Ascent becomes steeper, up a sort of staircase of limestone strata, slippery and difficult for laden animals. Alt. 2,855 ft. Ascent easier along the summit of a wooded spur (alt. 3,000 ft.), the track leading over loose stones and rocky ledges. An upland plateau lies to the E., bordered by outliers from a rugged mass of hills in that direction. It is frequented by small tribes of predatory Kurds. Crossing a rocky spur into a small basin draining W. the path reaches Faudnq, a small Chaldaean hamlet (alt. 3,340 ft.), which has an extensive view to the W. The Tigris makes a semicircular sweep of about 8 m. to the W. At the S. end of this part of its course the river flows in a narrow gorge for 4 m. between cliffs 300 ft. high. Above this gorge the valley is more open and at the northern end of this section is a mile wide. N194 LAND ROUTES Eoute goes by Fanduq to avoid the steep side-valleys along the Tigris. Beyond the river is the Tur Abdin plateau. To E. of Fanduq is a steep ridge with a narrow, rocky summit. Eocky spur (alt. 3,440 ft.) is crossed and the descent to the Tigris begins along an easy track in a valley f m. wide. Poaran and Berivana, two small villages, are passed, but the country was described in 1888 as neglected and deserted. Descend easily by a firm track through oaks. The Tigris is reached, and a rough track followed along the bank. Pass Saidiyeh, a Kurd village high up on a rocky ravine to r., up which mule tracks lead towards Deh through very difficult country. Cross a stream. Isolated rock in Tigris channel, about 20 yds. from the r. bank. Cross some streams flowing from the ridge to the r. in deep narrow cuts. Path becomes narrow and difficult, straggling through boulders along a narrow track by a ledge barely 3 ft. wide under cliffs 300 ft. high. The path is obstructed by trees and undergrowth. Path leaves the river and strikes across a low but difficult spur. Path regains river. Challek, on the opposite bank, a Syrian and Kurd village of 40 houses, with one large stone building. This is a halting-place for rafts, and is a river-port for villages to the W., from which grain and firewood are shipped. A track runs from Challek to Midiat Kerboran. Above Challek the river descends through a fine gorge with lofty limestone cliffs. The road is a badly defined track among fallen boulders and is impassable in flood, when the river may rise 30 ft. in the gorge. Cross large stream from a gorge in the ridge to r. Beyond this the path leaves the bank and zigzags up a steep rocky ascent, and descends gently on the other side towards the Bohtan. Some cultivation of corn, rice, and cotton was observed in 1888. Pass Wahzidi, ^m. L, a village on a plateau which over looks the junction of the Tigris and Bohtan, IJr m. to W. At the junction is Til, a place of great antiquity. From Til an easy road leads to Eidhwan on the Sairt -Diarbekr road (see lloutc 102 b). On the far bank of the BohtanROUTE 85 195 Miles from J eziret- ibn- 'Omar 45 47i 50 51A 52 53 53A 55 57i the country is open, rising in a long glacis to terrace-like plateaux. Across the Tigris are the ridges and ravines of the Ashita Dagh, covered with oak and brushwood. Track ascends the Bohtan valley. There is good open ground for camps on either bank of the Bohtan ; firewood abundant and drinking water plentiful and good. Baliq, village ; some cultivation. Mu'tadd, a Kurdish village near a small spring with some cultivation and small orchards. End of a rocky ridge overlooks village from E., at a distance of -I m. The Bohtan is joined on the r. bank by a large affluent formed by the combined waters of the Bitlis Su and Keser Su. The lower part of the valley of this tributary is fairly open, with bare slopes and low cliffs at intervals, and 3 m. up-stream it is crossed by a good masonry bridge—the Nasr ed-Din Koprii (see Route 102 b). A track leads W. to Ridhwan. Above the junction are the ruins of a masonry bridge over the Bohtan, of which the centre arches have been swept away. Pass Dodoisu village on the opposite bank. Perry-boat kept near here. Cross the Zoraweh Chai, flowing from the hilly country to the E. On the far bank is Beloriz, a small Kurdish village. The path is now an easy track along the river bank. Just before entering a gorge the Bohtan has to be forded. The river is here 120 yds. wide, but the ford is diagonal, and is 450 yds. long. When practicable it is 3 to 3-| ft. deep near the left bank, but gets shallower towards the right. It is only passable at low water. Otherwise a ferry is used, the boat for which is usually kept near Dodoisu (see m. 51^). The bank is shelving and easy. The gorge is now entered by a 10 ft. track along the base of the cliff, and a few feet above water-level. Pass Siyah Khan, a rock-cut chamber in the face of the cliff. The path rounds the base of the cliff and is difficult for ^ m. About here route from Diarbekr joins (see Eoute 102 b, m. 85J). The valley opens out. Path among boulders and stones.

On the 1. bank rises a cliff above which is a sloping terrace f m. wide, topped by a wall of rock 300 ft. to 400 ft, high. Oak scrub on the slopes. The ascent is easy at first, then gets steeper, and ends in short paved zigzags with a roadway of 10-12 ft. or narrower at some points. The top of the steepest part is reached (alt. 2,750 ft.) and an easy clay track follows, going up a bare dry valley to the N. Aderius, ^ m. to the 1. Eoad reaches head of ravine and enters Sairt. From Sairt the T.L. to Bitlis strikes N., while the route under description goes NW. along a projected (1888) to Bitlis, the first 3 m. of which across the open plain were well metalled, and practicable for wheels. The telegraph line towards Diarbekr goes along the which has probably been further improved of late years. Descend by a stony track to the Keser Sn, 2| ft. deep in September. It rises to 5 or 6 ft. in April or May. Ford the stream. Here a track to Diarbekr by Sinan branches off. Pass Serpir on the r., near a ruined stone bridge. Cross a fertile plain passing Keseri hamlet and Erbin village (on the r.), and then skirting some low hills. Turn NE. and follow a valley, in which is a small, brackish stream. The valley leads towards the Bitlis Su, to which there is a steep descent by a fair track. Pass Maclar on the r. Pass Seriyan on the r. On the 1. bank of the river low ground with cotton cultivation. Ford the Bitlis Su. It is usually passable except in spring. The track follows the r. bank, over sandy soil, and passing a spring. On the 1. bank are high hills fairly wooded. Sulha, a small Kurd hamlet. Here the road leaves the river which comes down from a gorge to the NE. Ascend a narrow valley, skirting in places a winding torrent bed (dry in September). Cross into another similar valley, with scattered oak and hawthorn. Gevri Giaour, a village to the r.

Here the Diarbekr-Bitlis road comes in from the W. (See 103 a, m, 109^.) Eoad turns in a north-easterly direction, and enters the valley of a large stream flowing from the NW. Kosiar, a Chris tian village, is visible some 4 m. up the valley on a spur. Cross stream by two old 20-ft. stone arches reported in 1899 to be just passable for guns. The made road at that date here ceased for a short distance. Follow an easy clay track practicable for guns. Enter valley of the Bitlis Su, and follow a road which in 1899 was made but not metalled nor completed : a 12-15-ft. roadway had been cut in the slope. Many small springs cross the road, difficult in wet weather, but drying later. No bridges nor culverts had been made in 1899. Oak scrub. The Bitlis Su now 300 yds. to r. in a deep gorge. On the 1. bank are steep wooded spurs rising to a higher range beyond. Lower wooded hills are visible m. to 1. Cross some craggy ravines from that direction. Valley opens with easier slopes; approach closer to the river, about 150-200 ft. above it. Narrower defile with cliffs on far bank. Valley opens. High wooded spurs to r. Hills on 1. become gradually lower. The country is not difficult, but much cut up by ravines, and guns could not move far from the road. Chapiran bridge across the Bitlis Su. The made road continues up the r. bank (see under m. 90): the track used by the authority here followed crosses the river by the bridge. The bridge in 1899 was half-ruined. The main span, a 50-ft. arch, was then in fair repair: the foundations of the arch rest on a rock in mid-stream. Two small arches next the 1. bank were much broken, and although it had been repaired the bridge was difficult even for mules. It is better, when possible, to ford the stream 100 yds. lower down. The ford is easy except in flood. 300 yds. beyond the bridge cross another bridge of one198 LAND EOUTES 40-ft. span over a side stream from wooded hills to the E. High, pointed arch, with approaches much worn away. The stream has little water except in flood and can be forded. Ascend gradually a high, wooded spur from the E. Easy track among stony and shaly hills dotted with oak and juniper. Kiver makes a sharp bend to NW. in an open valley. Cross wooded plateau at the summit of a spur. A series of good springs. In 1899 it was reported that the road hereabouts would require levelling and cutting at several points for the passage of guns. Deep gorge of the Modeki Su emerging from the hills on the other side of the river becomes visible. The made road crosses this river by an old stone bridge just above the junction of the Modeki with the Bitlis. Millo village is near the bridge on the r. bank of the Modeki.

The chaussee has been cut in the loose rock up the steep slope, and continues up the r. bank. After some heavy rock cutting in a spur on the r. bank below Dukhan, it is carried along the steep cliff on the r. bank and to the plateau beyond, and is passable for guns. The present track crosses to 1. bank of the Bitlis Su by a 30-ft. stone arch, half ruined in 1899. Steep narrow ascent on 1. bank. Follow a stony track through low oaks and undergrowth. Valley closes in to 200 yds. wide, bordered by steep, craggy slopes with trees and brushwood. Dukhan (alt. 3,515 ft.), large khan in the river valley, now contracted between high, rocky ranges and with steep, wooded slopes. Few supplies. Country sparsely popu lated. The villages are small and off the road. T. L. (one wire) from Diarbekr to Bitlis follows the pass. Leaving Dukhan the track is stony, but fairly easy. Cross to the r. bank by a wooden bridge of 35-ft. span built where the river narrows in a rocky gorge, and rejoin the chaussee which is 20 ft. wide, and cut in the hill-side. The chaussee winds along the face of a spur. Pass Keufurdur QaVah, a small ruined fort near a ruined khan on a knoll to the 1. Koad then keeps close along the stream. To the 1. are craggy terraces with a few oaks and shrubs. High up on a slope to the E. is Shattakh, a small village 1^ m. off. The valley here is about 400 yds. wide at the bottom ; the river winds a good deal, and in the loops are small, level places suitable for camps. Pass Qara Qau ruins up a side valley. To the W. is the high range of the Akyab Dagh, topped by a succession of rugged pinnacles. Trees and undergrowth decrease as Bitlis is neared, owing to their being cut for firewood.200 LAND ROUTES Miles from Jeziret- ibn- 'Omar Ajem Khan, in ruins. On either side are rocky valleys. The river is a rapid torrent among boulders and stones. The chaussee, keeping generally along the river-bank, improves as Bitlis is approached, and there are good stone culverts (1888). The valley narrows, and rocky spurs approach from the 1. The river emerges from a gorge with limestone cliffs, and on the far side is the hamlet of Surib (or Surim). The chaussee ascends by an easy gradient, with a retaining wall on the river side. Towards the summit of the ascent is a ridge of whitish rock, a deposit from a mineral spring higher up the mountain. Through this rock the road passes by a tunnel 20 ft. long, 12 ft. broad, and 12 ft. high. Higher up is an old tunnel, smaller, for the former track, but now disused. This is the Delikli Tash, said to have been made in ancient times. The ascent continues for a short distance, the being well revetted with stone, and the valley then opens out to about a mile wide. Pakhand, a village 1 m. distant on opposite bank on steep rocky slope. Cultivation in terraces and a few orchards. On that side a valley comes in from SE., down which runs the track from Kifra and Olek to Sairt, crossing by an old masonry bridge (Route 86 c). The chaussee, 24 ft. wide, ascends gradually. Cross to the 1. bank by a masonry arch of 40-ft. span, keep along the base of a cliff under some stone quarries. Bitlis. Enter the southern end of the town by a gradient of 1 in 25.

Cross the Kamatan Dereh, a tributary of the Ghindig running in a rocky valley. Pass the deep, narrow valley of Yerun close to its junction with the Ghindig. Pass Yerun, a Kurdish and Armenian village some distance above, whence rough tracks lead direct to Bitlis. Ascending from the valley the track is narrow and goes high above the river gorge. Cross a low wooded ridge. Enter the Kiliisan plain near the village of the same namej situated among the ruins of an earlier Moslem city'. A little farther up the plain is Ghaida Tekkeh (alt. 4,030 ft.), an important Kurdish place of pilgrimage, where travellers are expected to dismount m. off.' A Sheikh who fought in the last Russian war is buried here, and the place is a Kurdish political centre. The soil and climate are good, and rice, wheat, rye, and vines and other fruits are cultivated. There are several villages. Ascend some low, wooded hills by an easy track and descend to Qara Su (alt. 4,610 ft.), lying in a valley, 50 Kurdish and Armenian houses. Qara Su is the head-quarters of the Kaza of Khisan, and the Kaimmakam resides here. The country is well-wooded and fertile and has many villages of Kurds and Armenians. Vines in particular do well, and there is a large production of raisins. Wheat and other crops give good returns, but there is little surplus produce, and supplies could not be counted on. Firewood low oak, and scrub, is plentiful. o 2212 LAND ROUTES Miles from Sairt A mountain track, only possible in summer, runs up the Durin-Mervan valley and over the Av-i-Berkhan to the Agherov Gedik, where it joins the road from Mukus to Van (see Bowte 87 a, m. 62). Several hill routes radiate from Qara Su, and communication with Bitlis and Mukus is easy. Boute 88, Mukus—Bitlis, at m. 26, is crossed here. (An easier but longer route to Qara Su might be found by following the Sairt—Mukus road, 87 a, across the Ghindig and as far as the Desht-i-Ovi, at m. 39^, whence a comparatively easy route leads by the Mazara valley, across the Ghindig Su, and by Khisan (see m. 36 above) to Qara Su. This would avoid the difficult country between Ma'den and Khisan, but would be about 63 m., though not much longer in time than the route de scribed.) On leaving. Qara Su the road descends a valley at first broad and cultivated, then narrowing, with low clay hills covered with oak scrub on either hand. There are a few vineyards. A small stream is crossed by a stone bridge, and a ridge of reddish clay hills (alt. 4,840 ft.) ascended. A good mule-track leads through oak scrub with the deep valley of the Qara Su below to the 1. The mouth of a large tributary valley on the far bank is passed. A track leads up to Dadig and so on to Bitlis. Khoros, 250 Kurd houses, lies about 2 m, up this valley, with Chukh near it in a side valley. On the slopes near are vineyards. Follow a very steep descent towards the Qara Su in a narrow gorge, with a view of the Ghindig in another gorge to r. Cross the Qara Su (alt. 3,850 ft.) by a bridge of logs and fascines, 6-ft. roadway and 40-ft. span. This is the usual type of bridge in this part of the country, and is suitable for mule traffic, but not for carts. The path goes steeply up a stony clay slope, sparsely wooded, and skirts the Ghindig Su in a deep gorge bordered by precipitous mountains, then crosses a narrow spur, and descends to the river by steep zigzags. G-hitsan Dereh, a long defile in which a stony, rough track follows the Ghindig.

N. of the Asgor Dereh is the rocky, conical peak of Sinagir Dagh. The path passes under the steep wooded crags of Kulat Dagh. Chummin (alt. 4,130 ft.), a few houses on the far bank. Stony track along the river crosses a small stream from a narrow gorge on 1., and enters a deep loop to the SW., winding round a rocky spur, the summit crowned by a remarkable rock, the Sinban Task. On the far bank a narrow, wooded valley joins, with the village of Kot about half-way up it. The track is easy over a clay slope with good walnut trees. To E. is the prominent peak of Sinagir Dagh. Chemkani Tekkeh, a celebrated shrine, with a few houses round the main building. There is a rough wooden bridge across the river, whence a track ascends the mountain valley of Akhtis (Armenian Yeghigis), from which steep paths lead over the Agherov Dagh and down to Lake Van. On a crag to r. are ruins of a celebrated Kurd stronghold, and Sinban and two other villages lie in a cultivated basin high up the slopes to E. The stream is crossed to 1. bank by a frail bridge of logs and fascines, 40-ft. span. At the end of the loop (see m. 48 above) a good track by the river is followed. There are fine walnut and fruit- trees here and some cultivation. The track has been im proved for transport of firewood to the lake, and on to Van. Pass Kitikhan, a few houses on the far bank. The road goes through Ajan, a Kurd hamlet, and passes Ala Khan, a larger hamlet, off the opposite bank, at the foot of a steep slope amid cultivation. The track is now good along a cultivated slope. Cross to r. bank by a bridge of logs and fascines on a stone pier with one span of 40 ft. and one of 30 ft.

There is a good clay track among terraces with stone walls. 55 Cross the Uranz Dereh, a large stream from the NW. draining the country S. of Kindranz and Karchikan. Pass Uranz. A track to Karchikan leads up the narrow valley by the r. bank of the stream. On the S. bank is the Dalist Dagh, a high, stony range, and 1 m. up the valley on the r. bank is Zangirs village. A frail footbridge crosses the main stream; there are patches of cultivation, and trees of walnut, oak, and ash in the valley. Steep crags then close in and the track is stony, but in 1881 had been improved in the worst places, and was a fair mule road. A rough track continues up the r. bank, but it is better when possible to cross to the 1. bank by a bad ford among boulders, just below a broken stone bridge, near 57 Khanjars, Armenian village of 30 houses, at the mouth of the Andavin Dereh, a valley 2 m. long to ESE. The mouth of the Hirnik stream running down a large valley from the NW. is passed, with a small village, Injesor, on its 1. bank a mile up. The road in 1881 had been improved by cutting the rocky slope at the worst points, and was then a good mule-track. 58 Chavrakh, Armenian hamlet, with cultivation on the far bank, with a frail wooden bridge crossing to it. On the near bank another part of the same village is passed, clustered round the house of a local Kurdish chief of some influence of the 'Ali Qanli tribe. A stony track follows; the valley widens and rounded clay hills come into view to the N.: there is also a large stream from the N. from Naniganz. Tracks lead up to this place and to others on the shore of Lake Van. 59 Engatzar (alt. 5,480 ft.), 33 Kurd and Armenian houses, on the r. bank at the junction.

In 1905 it was not practicable for wheeled traffic, although in 1900 some stretches of it had been metalled, and parts had been regraded: it is possible that this work has been completed over the whole length, but since the labour required was considerable this is not probable. On the Armenian population compare p. 32. Bitlis. Leaving the market on the r. bank of the stream a wide road leads to a fairly easy ascent m. distant, whence a 30-ft. metalled road leads along a plateau. The road then crosses first a ravine from 1. by a 20-ft. stone bridge, and later, by a 30-ft. stone bridge, a stream from Popshin on 1., 30 Armenian houses. Beyond this second bridge it follows the Bitlis stream, here running in an impassable gorge 50 ft. wide which bends to E., and skirts a stony spur from E.; at this point the road was not metalled in 1900, but the track is stony and good for wheeled traffic. The valley opens out to a width of 500 yds. of level, stony ground, the gorge gets shallower and less steep, and the Poar stream is passed over. A. track on r. leads by a stone bridge to the alternative route to Shamunis. A stream from 1. is crossed.

IVROUTES BETWEEN MOSUL AND DIAEBEKR ROUTES 90 a, b MOSUL—JEZIKET-IBN-'OMAR General Note on Koutes E. of the Tigris Between Mosul and Feishkhabur the Tigris valley is not suited to movement by land. The river flows in a tortuous course through defiles with steep cliffs of limestone, clay, and conglomerate, and the country near the E. side of the valley is cut up by numerous deep and difficult ravines which run towards the Tigris. The route from Mosul to Jeziret-ibn-'Omar passing E. of the Tigris, therefore avoids the river in this part of its course, and runs first in a general NNW. direction over an easy, undulating plain through Filfil to the Dohuk Su. Beyond that stream it follows a terrace of rolling, fairly easy ground which lies between the foot of the rugged range of the Jebel Abyadh on the E. and the very broken country along the Tigris to the W. In the neighbourhood of Simel there is a choice of routes to Jezlret-ibn-'Omar: (i) Via Zakho. See Route 90 a below. (ii) Via Feishkhabur. See Route 90 b below. Before the war caravans went fairly frequently from Mosul to Feishkhabur by the route E. of the Tigris, and at Feishkhabur crossed the river by ferry and struck across the plains W. of the Tigris to Jezlret-ibn-'Omar or Nisibin. The direct route between Mosul and Nisibin W. of the Tigris has been used since the war for the passage of troops in winter, spring, and early summer. In late summer (from July) and in autumn troops apparently moved from Nisibin to Mosul by J eziret-ibn-'Omar; but their exact route is not known. See Boute 91.EOUTE 90 a 227 ROUTE 90 a MOSUL—JEZIEET-IBN-'OMAE (.110 m.) Via Zakho Authorities; — Military Report on E.T.A., vol. iii (report of 1888). Route report of 1903. Notes by a traveller of 1909. This important main route is described in detail by an authority who traversed it in June, 1888, and in less detail by another authority who passed along it in early autumn, 1903. It is not clear, however, how far the two authorities followed exactly the same track. There is a made and graded road, metalled in parts, and passable for wheels, to within 6 m. of Zakho. The metal is reported in 1903 as much worn, and traffic often left the metalled road. It seems clear that between Mosul and the Jebel Abyadh there are a great number of alternative tracks over the plain. Between Mosul and Zakho the only serious impediments to wheels are the river-beds mentioned in the itinerary (which are difficult for wheels in fine weather, and are probably made impassable by rain), and the Zakho mountain which is crossed at a height of 1,280 ft. (the 1903 authority says 1,510 ft.) above Zakho : on the northern slopes of this range the last six miles into Zakho were suitable only for pack-animals in 1903. Beyond Zakho to within 15 miles of Jezlret-ibn-'Omar the road is difficult for wheels on account of the river-beds that have to be crossed, but is not impassable for field artillery except in flood time. The track is brown soil without many stones. The last 15 miles into Jezlret-ibn-'Omar were reported in 1903 impassable for carts, owing to the accidented and stony nature of the road ; but the track could easily be improved. The rivers that present most difficulty are the Khabur (see m. 71 and 72^-) and the Hazil (m. 80|). Water is scarce in the first 29 m. of the route, but there is a good supply for the rest of the way. There is fair grazing in the KhabQr valley. Supplies are very scanty for military purposes except in the neighbourhood of Mosul, but en are sufficient for travellers. There is coal in the hills N. of the Khabur valley, principally near Sheranis and Harbol, to the N. of Zakho. Brushwood and some trees are available for fuel on the hills. p 2228 LAND ROUTES Fair camping-grounds for a force not over a division can be obtained at Butaq Su (m. 29^), Fai'deh (m. 33-|), Dohuk Su (m. 40|), Simel (m. 45^), Asi (m. 59^), and for larger forces at several points in the valley of the Khabur between Zakho and the Hazil river. In recent years the population of the country appears on the whole to have been decreasing. A traveller who passed over part of this route in 1906 says,' Between Mosul and Zakho new ruins meet the eye on every hand'. Between Zakho and Jezlret-ibn-'Omar there seem to have been more deserted than inhabited villages in 1903. This decay seems to have been caused by the depredations of Kurdish nomads which have been driving the population southwards. The Christian villages seem' to have suffered badly, and probably the Yezidis have also been much reduced. Miles from Mosul 0 Mosul. Cross bridge over Tigris. After crossing the bridge the route follows the left bank of the Khozer river. Mound of Nebi Yunus, with village on its summit, at some distance to r.

The 1888 authority gives Karana, a village of a few houses, as lying ^ m. to 1., on a rocky ravine 300 yds. broad and 100 ft. deep, with a stream over the ledges of rock. He says also that there were two mills, several irrigation channels, and patches of cultivation. He makes no mention of Fa'ideh.

A mill stands near the ford, and irrigation cuts are found along the banks. I tt m. up-stream is the Yezidi village of Dulep, 150 houses, with orchards and gardens. A mile down-stream is Girish.ch.ik, 100 houses, also Yezidi. T. L. to Jezlret-ibn-'Omar apparently leaves the road at or near the Dohuk Su, diverging to 1.

Cross a river-bed, 50 yds. wide, banks 30 ft. high, bottom firm earth : stream fordable in June, 1888. Simel, a scattered village, is apparently placed N. of this stream by the authority of 1888, whereas the authority of 1903 seems to suggest that it is on the S. bank. To the E., on a mound overlooking the stream, are the ruins of a stone fort some 60 yds. square. In 1888 this was the only Arab village in the neighbourhood, the others all being Kurdish. The plain round Simel was then fertile, a good deal of wheat and Indian cornKOUTE 90 a 231 Miles from Mosul 47i m 50 504 52^ 53 54i 55 591 being grown; but cultivation seems to have declined: there were 200 houses in the plain in 1888, whereas in 1903 there were only 30 houses and 50 tents. The country in the neighbourhood is open and treeless except for some poplars along the stream 5 m. to NE. Near the foot of the Jebel Abyadh is the small monastery of Keshafir on a prominent spur. Between Simel and Asi it is very doubtful whether the authority of 1888 followed the same track as that taken by the authority of 1903. _ The account given by the latter will be found under Asi (see m. 59^ below).

Terkejan, however, is placed 6 m. from Asi. Enter the Zakho pass. The account of the road to top of this is very briefly described by the 1903 observer as follows: ' The steep ascent begins N. by W., immediately beyond Terkejan on the regular metalled cart-road which, though not in good repair, is quite passable for wheels.' A traveller in 1909 confirms this, saying that the road is good. The length of the ascent is given as 2 m. The more detailed account of the 1888 observer, though doubtless no longer applicable in detail, may still prove serviceable. His instructions and times are as follows: Ascend gradually in a northerly direction by a valley 300 to 400 yds. wide with steep, shelving slopes ; then follow a mule road 12 ft. to 15 ft., paved in places, with easy gradient, up the E. side of the rocky ravine. At 16 min. from the beginning of the ascent, the height reached is 2,315 ft. The track averages 10 ft. to 12 ft. wide, cleared of stones, with easy gradient. A few bushes on the hill-sides. At 25 min. the altitude is 2,545 ft. At 30 min., for 100 yds., a paved 10-ft. track.^ • ■ m le l-A8i ty)- ?h. In gallons Bg; pring.

For 150 yds. from the summit the gradient is 12° up a series of short zigzags. At 33 min. the summit of pass (2,680 ft.) is reached. The length of the ascent is given as 2^- m. The 1903 observer's account of the road from the summit to Zakho is again very brief. He states that from the summit it is merely a rough, stony hill-path unfit for wheels. It is steep and zigzags continually. The 1909 traveller describes it as a bridle-path strewn with boulders. The steep descent ends 3 m. below the summit. It then goes down a gentle slope. 3^ ,m. below the summit there is a good spring on the r. From summit to Zakho is given as 6 m. The 1888 observer's account of the descent is as follows. He started to descend by an easy 20-ft. track, following a small stream. The road here could be ascended by wheels. At 7 min. from the beginning of the descent the altitude is 2,590 ft. At 23 min. it is 2,300 ft. At 42 min. the valley opens to f m. wide; stream keeps E. and disappears among some rounded spurs. Road crosses some wide grassy terraces forming lower spurs of the range. The hill-side is sparsely wooded with low oaks and undergrowth. At 46 min. the height is 2,020 ft. Road lies through large groves of oaks. The gradient is easy, following the 1. bank of a stream. The track is rough in places over sandstone. A little clearing of loose stones and clay would make this easily practicable for artillery. At 1 hr. 1 min. descend a clay spur between two ravines by some short zigzags; track 12 to 15 ft. wide. The route crosses a small stream and ascends by 12-ft. paved road with two zigzags cut in a ledge. At 1 hr. 13 min. the route descends the W. side of a clay spur towards the mouth of the pass. A mile to the r., on a grassy spur, is a small village called Hasan, sur rounded by vineyards. This would seem to be the place at which the 1903 observer reports a spring. At 1 hr. 21 min. the altitude is 1,870 ft. The road follows a stream in a deep valley with shelving clay sides, banks lined with oleanders and shrubs. At 1 hr. 41 min. the altitude is 1,670 ft. On either side of the valley are rounded, gravelly spurs, outliers from the main range.234 LAND ROUTES Miles from Mosul 71 72^ with grassy terraces between them and the rocky ridge behind. These hills offer a good site for defensive works to cover the entrance to the pass and town of Zakho from the north. At 1 hr. 51 min. the road passes along the slope 60 ft. above the stream. For i m. there is a retaining wall, 5 to 6 ft. high, of masonry, forming a good 12-ft. track. The valley is narrow, with steep clay and gravelly slopes, and occasional ledges of con glomerate. The valley then opens, and Zakho is reached at 2 hr, 10 min. L. bank of Khabur. Zakho, on an island in stream. From this point there are three ways of starting for Jezlret- ibn-'Omar. (a) Pass over the bridge (10-ft. roadway) which leads from the 1. bank of the Khabur river to the island upon which the more ancient part of Zakho is built, and then ford the northern channel to the r. bank of the Khabur, where stands the Christian Quarter of Zakho. This northern channel is usually fordable for laden mules at the end of June, but not before. On the r. bank of the Khabur route (c), below, is joined. (&amp;) A second route was followed by the authority of 1903. Descend the 1. bank of the Khabur, passing on r. the villages of Bedar (or Dedar, 2| m.), 25 houses, and Chammaymishko (3|m.), 1 m. to r., across the Khabur. At 4^ m. ford the Khabur: low 1. bank, r. bank 30 ft. high, stony bottom, 80 yds. wide, 2^ ft. deep, current 3 m. p. h. Crossing was awkward, even in the dry season, on account of the depth of water. On the r. bank route (c) is joined at or near Dornoch (or Lurnaq): see m. 80^, below. (c) The third route is that which is followed by the main road. It proceeds up the left bank of the Khabur, skirting conglomerate cliffs which overhang the water, passing a backwater where rafts are built, and con tinuing as follows. Masonry bridge, 148 yds. long, with one central arch of a high-pointed shape, 40-ft. span, and 40 ft. above water- level at the centre, having two small spans on the 1. bank, and one on the r. bank. Its roadway is 15 ft. wide, paved with round stones, described as being 'slippery as glass'.

Route (6), above, joins about here. Cross dry, gravelly bed, 80 yds. wide, of stream from N. Road runs as a tangent to a loop of the river for m., which then bends S. Main channel 50 to 60 yds. wide, current rapid in June. River reported fordable from middle of July at several places below Zakho. Skirt river for a short way, then strike across plain, which has a rich clay soil overlying gravel. Some wheat and maize. Proceed along river for ^ m., following a ledge in a gravelly cliff over the water. Pass cluster of Kurdish huts, called Dornoch (1888). Procure guide for the ford of the Hazil. The 1903 authority locates on r. a fort and village of 30 houses, with wells, which he calls ' Lurnak' (Lurnaq). Low- water ford crosses Khabur a little over 1 m. from Lurnaq. Ford the Hazil river which comes from a gap in the mountains a few miles to the NE. It straggles in several channels over a wide pebbly bed. The principal one in June was 80 yds. wide and 3 ft. deep, with a strong current. It is reported even in l.w. season as 60 yds. wide, 3 ft. deep, current 3^ m. p. h. A guide is necessary, as there are no landmarks on either bank. It is often unfordable with a very powerful current, and has then to be crossed by raft. Through maize-fields (1888) irrigated by canals from the Hazil. 4 m. to N., under the foot of the hills, is the site of a Christian village of 200 houses surrounded by orchards, called Tel Ehabbin ; the village was partly ruined in 1888 by Kurdish raiders and was deserted in 1903. Near it is a stream with a flow estimated, in 1903, at 20,000 gallons p. h. Wasit, another Christian village, was 1 m.

Account of 1903 places Little Arabiyeh (Rubahi ?) on the r. of the road 3 m. from Nahrawan. In 1888 a village called Rubahi was reported to lie on the Tigris m. to 1. of road and 4^ m. from Nahrawan. No mention is made of such a village in 1903, though tw T o deserted villages on the Tigris, called'Arabiyeh, were reported—one here, the other at m. 96^ ; see m. 96^.

A large grove of poplars along the banks. This would seem to be the stream which the 1903 authority names the 'Arabiyeh. His account indicates that he crossed it at m. 96J. At this point the 1888 authority reports a ruined fort on knoll overlooking a bend of the river. Gardens and orchards round the foot of the hill. Narrow track through gardens, crossing irrigation cuts. Telegraph follows the 1. bank at the foot of a gravelly cliff, 60 ft. high, skirting a bentLof the Tigris. Track is 10-12 ft. broad, rather stony, and obstructed by blocks of conglomerate fallen from the cliff above. It might easily be improved into a good road. About this point the 1903 authority crossed a stream flowing to the Tigris with water in early autumn 10 ft. wide, 10 in. deep, with a current 3^ m. p. h. -g; m. on, large deserted village of'Arabiyeh to 1. is reported in 1903.

Telegraph and Travel (journey of 1864). This route diverges from Boute 90 a apparently near Simel; but it seems that there are a number of tracks branching off from 90 a between the Dohuk Su and Asi which could be made the beginning of a route to Feishkhabur. It rejoins 90 a near m. 94^ on the N. side of the Khabur valley. The T.L. follows the general line of thisEOUTES 90 a, b 239 route. There is no satisfactory information as to the character of this route, which as far as Feishkhabur is frequently followed by caravans. Between Simel and Feishkhabur a number of streams are crossed, two of which, the Mezri and the Girkulderasi, may be difficult. Near Feishkhabur the western end of the Jebel Abyadh has to be crossed ; its slopes are here fairly easy. N. of the Jebel Abyadh is the most serious obstacle on the route, the Khabur, which is reported to be fordable in the dry season at several places between Mosul and Zakho. The length of the route is uncertain, as it is not clear where the Khabur can best be crossed. Supplies for military purposes are probably very scanty. There is grazing in the Khabur valley, and apparently abundant water. Miles from Mosul 0 454 77i? 80A? 87A? 103? Mosul. Follow Houte 90 a. Simel.

This route connects Amadiyeh with the roads from Mosul to • Jezlret-ibn-'Omar by Zakho and Feishkhabur respectively, and also connects these roads with each other. As far as the Sipneh Chai the route follows the road from Amadiyeh to Mosul by Dohuk [Route 67 b). From that point it diverges westward, being as far as Navlshki an easy hill track through a country with some cultivation and plentyKOUTES 90 b, c 241 of water and fuel. From Navlshki to Zakho it is on the whole fairly easy, being almost level for considerable stretches, but much of it is stony and accidented: trees everywhere here, but hardly any cultivation, and no villages. Prom Zakho to Feishkhabur the authority of 1888 followed a track which seems on the whole easy and may be passable for wheels. The authority of 1903, who seems to have taken approximately the same line, found the track fairly easy, though rather stony and accidented for the last half of the distance. A few villages are passed on this part of the route ; there is plenty of brushwood and water, and a good deal of cultivation. Miles from Amadi- yeh o 24 294? 33 35i 37| m 46i 52 54i 54| MES.

EOUTE 91 MOSUL—NISIBIN (131m.?) Via Eski Mosul and Tel Eumelan Authorities: —Hinriclis (journey of 1911), Oppenheim (journey of 1893). The country between Mosul and Nisibin, W. of the Tigris, is for many miles undulating desert, broken here and there by low hills or mounds that mark the site of ancient settlements. Wheeled traffic crossed the plain between Mosul and Nisibin before the war, but no details regarding the route followed by it are available. The ground is said to be heavy after rain. In winter the snow sometimes lies on the plain for weeks, causing great hardship to animals. In spring the whole area is covered with herbage, and there seems at that season to be a fair supply of water, either in wells or wadis. These conditions, however, last onty for a few weeks. No fuel or supplies for troops could be expected before the war. The population is almost entirely nomad. The railway between Nisibin and Mosul is planned (according toKOUTES 90 d, 91 245 a report of 1913) to run by Kesik Koprti (see Appendix 2 to this route) and Tel Kumelan. No information as to improvements since 1914 is available. See Appendix 4, p. 250, for route of Turks, 1916. The tracks usually followed by travellers in recent years have kept well to the NE. of the more direct routes, probably because there seems to be more likelihood of finding good water in that direction (e. g. in the Saweidiyeh river). In summer the heat is intense, sand-storms are frequent, and draughts of poisonous wind are occasionally met with. Miles from Mosul 0 Mosul.

The route was apparently to be given up in July owing to lack of water: see p. 226. The stages from Nisibin were:— Dogara (9 hrs.); Kirikin (6 hrs.: 1^ hrs. for crossing two streams); Demir Kapu (6 hrs. : see main route, above, m. 91^); Akhlat el- Kachet (?hrs.); Awenat (5 hrs.: 1 day's halt: see App. 2 and 3, above); Hakta (5 hrs.); Shanazeel (7 hrs.); Hamadan (4 hrs.): Mosul (4 hrs.). EOUTE 92 a MOSUL—NISIBIN (156^ m.) Via B eled S injak Authorities : —E. Sachau (journey of 1880); Eoute 23 (report of 1908) ; San e and Herzfeld (journey of 1908) ; notes by a traveller who went over this route (following (ii) between Mosul and Tel A'far) a few years before the war (exact date uncertain); No. 191 (report of 1914). This route runs over plain or low undulations throughout its course, except at the pass over the Jebel Sinjar. It appears to be practicable for wheels from Mosul to the pass across the Sinjar, though this does not seem to have been stated explicitly by any of the authorities who have gone over the ground except as regards the stage from Mosul to Tel Afar. The pass through the Jebel Sinjar is low and fairly easy, but the road is stony and might need improving for wheeled traffic. This is said to be the only pass practicable for caravans across the Sinjar range, though there are besides a number of difficult tracks over the hills. It seems that the plain between the Sinjar hills and Nisibin, though easy going in dry weather, would be very difficult for wheels after rain. For further notes on the going see below under Eoutes (i) and (ii) to Tel Afar, and under m. 39, m. 76, m. 99, m. 113. The inhabitants are mainly Arabs in the plains and Yezidis in and near the hills. There are Turkomans at Tel Afar.KOUTES 91, 92 a 251 There is cultivation at intervals along the route from Mosul to Beled Sinjar and at the foot of the Toq hills, but supplies would probably not be available in any considerable quantities. N. of the Sinjar range the country is quite destitute of settled inhabitants and cultivation up to about 10-12 m. from Nisibin. No nomad camps are mentioned. Water is generally fairly plentiful. There is very little on Route (ii) from Mosul to Tel A'far. Beyond Tel A'far the plain is watered by springs and by streams from the hills to the N. Between Tel A'far and the - neighbourhood of Beled Sinjar (see under m. 39) the water is somewhat sulphurous and brackish though drinkable. N. of the Sinjar range water is to be had (at least in winter and spring) from a number of streams, but it does not appear to be very good. No information is available as to the water-supply in this plain during the summer and autumn. Apparently some grazing is to be found in winter on the plains between Mosul and Tel A'far, and between the Sinjar hills and Nisibin, and it is probably abundant in spring on these sections of the route. Fuel is apparently lacking except in parts of the Sinjar hills. Miles from Mosul 0 10 16 16* 18| 20 22 Mosul. From Mosul to Tel A'far there are two possible routes.

This wadi, or possibly another crossed in the neighbourhood, is called Wadi Debuneh, which was reported in 1880 as probably containing water at most seasons. The depression in which the Wadi Debuneh lies is thickly strewn with large blocks of stone. In the plain to NE. of it is a hill called Tashtah, near which there is said to be a spring. The plain is bounded on N. and S. by low ridges running NW. and _ SE. Uch. Tepeh., three tels about ^-l m. S. of the track. 'Ain el-Beidha, three springs near a small hill. Abu Miriam, small village on a Spring on W. side of the tel, and cultivation in plain to W. There are several other tels in the plain. A ridge bounds the plain to N., 3-6 m. distant, running in a NW. direction. A wadi is crossed. Track rises very gradually. Route reaches the top of the gradual slope, here crossing the line of the low hills called Jebel Mehlebiyeh. It then gradually descends a valley (cultivated in 1880), with low hills on either side. Route passes a rain-water pool. A little farther on is a cistern. Tel A'far.

From Tel A'far to Beled Sinjar the route is generally easy, running over open, undulating ground or cultivated plain; but in January, 1880, the going was soft as the result of melting snow. Up to the Solaq Chai (2^ m. from Beled Sinjar) the water on the route, though plen tiful, is brackish, and only just drinkable. For 11^ m. beyond Tel A'far the route goes across an undulating plain slightly depressed in the middle, bounded by ridges to N. and open on the S. A number of tels are scattered over the plain. Stream flowing S. crossed (January, 1880). Apparently about this point, or a short distance farther on, a group of tels are seen at about 1 hr.'s ride to S. Tel Wardan, large eminence.

Tel er-Rus, a few hundred yards to S. of track. Stream flowing SE. is crossed. This is apparently the Wadi Mujeirat, but a recent authority mentions the Jibbareh Chai as a small, boggy stream 3-| m. from the Wadi Ibreh. Tel Abu Fuseikeh lies apparently about m. to the N. on the r. bank of the Wadi Sharai. Cultivation and small villages near it. Cultivation apparently ceases in this neighbourhood. Ain esh-Sharid, ruin-field, and spring near which is some cultivation. Low ridge running W. begins on N. It is 1-2 m. from the track. Between this point and m. 57 are several water-courses. Apparently in this neighbourhood (2^ hrs.' ride from Wadi el-Ibreh) lies the spring of 'Ain Tineh, under the ridge to the N., ^ hr.'s ride WSW. of it is said to lie the four springs of 'Ain el-Ghassan, luke-warm and sulphurous. To SSW. from e Ain el-Ghassan, about one day ? s march distant, is seen a hill called Tel Tartar, in which a tepid sulphurous spring takes its rise. This spring was believed by a traveller of 1880 to be the head of the Tartar river. Other springs feeding the Tartar seem to lie near Beled Sinjar. Wadi containing water (December). This wadi is appa rently a short distance W. of 'Ain el-Ghassan. El-Khan, ruins of a large khan beside the track. Springs in the neighbourhood called El-Hararat, or 'Ain el- Khan. In 1906 the Mendikan tribe was encamped here. The bulk of the tribe are Yezidi by religion, but the Sheikhs and some of the families are Moslem. Ground from about here to Beled Sinjar was reported as very soft in January, 1880, owing to the melting of snow on the hills.ROUTE 92 a 255 Miles from Mosul 62A 64i 65 654 66| 68| 70 71i ' 2 72 72i 73 74i 76 77| 78i Cross large wadi with steep banks.

Via B ekran and S amukha Authority : —Forbes, in Journal of the Ro vol. ix (1839), This route passes along the northern edge of the main range of the Sinjar hills. Very little can be said regarding the state of the road followed or as to the supplies obtainable. So far as is known, it has not been crossed by any European traveller for a great many years. As far as Samukha water is fairly plentiful, at least in spring, and fuel may be got when the hills are entered at about m. 60. From Samukha the track lies across the desert where no supplies or fuel are obtainable. The first 20-30 m. from Samukha are badly supplied with water, the streams which flow N. from the hilfs speedily losing themselves in the desert. For the next few miles, till about m. 146, water seems to be fairly plentiful but brackish. Beyond this point no more water is mentioned till the Jaghjagha is reached. Miles from Mosul 0 Mosul.

Nisibin. EOUTES 93 a, b JEZlRET-IBN-'OMAR—NISIBIN General Note The routes from Jezlret-ibn-'Omar to Nisibin run over the undulating country at the southern foot of the Tur Abdin plateau, which presents the appearance of a great wall rising abruptly from the plain. _ There are two routes, a northern and a southern. The former is described as the caravan route, the latter as a post-road. These routes would seem to coincide to the neighbourhood of Tel-i-Bel (m. 19) and again from Latlfeh to Nisibin (the last 4 m. of the way): between Tel-i-Bel and Latlfeh they are within a few miles of each other. The southern route appears to be a few miles longer than the northern, and is difficult, owing to heavy going, in winter. It may be remarked that the difference in length between the two routes is probably not so great as suggested by the estimates in the text. See note at end of introduction to Eoute 93 b.KOUTES 92 b, 98 a 261 KOUTE 93 a JEZIRET-IBN-'OMAK—NISIBIN (63 m.) N orthern R oute, via N arinja Authorities:— Military Report onE.T.A., Koute 188 (report of 1903). Report of a traveller who went over the route in recent years before the war (exact date uncertain). This is a good but stony caravan road, impassable for wheels, though easy for baggage animals. From Jezlret-ibn-'Omar to Narinja the road ascends gradually for about 3J m. to a crest, and is rather rough and stony: afterwards it passes over open, gently undulating- country in which cultivation and rocky lava-strewn ground alternate. From Narinja to Grhirimira the track winds over open undulating ground, which, though rocky in places, is easier than the country between Jezlret-ibn-'Omar andNarinja: it is also less cultivated. From Ghirimira to Nisibin the route is very easy all the way, through level, fertile, well-cultivated country containing irrigation cuts, rice- fields, mills, and tree plantations. There is a good supply of water, even in the dry season, from streams, springs, and wells along the whole route. Grazing apparently good, especially in spring. Fuel scarce. A fair amount of supplies is procurable near Jezlret-ibn- 'Omar and Nisibin, but not much elsewhere. Troops could camp near most of the streams crossed but could get very little but water and grass. The villages, which are small, belong mainly to semi-nomadic Kurds, and a large part of the inhabitants, with their flocks and herds, move up to the hills in the summer. One account states that the Hawerki Kurds occupy the country between Jezlret-ibn-'Omar and Servan, the Aznair are found between Servan and the neighbourhood of Latlfeh, and the Bonursi between Latlfeh and Nisibin. Another account reports Alika Kurds between Jezlret- ibn-'Omar and Ghizhel, and Omerka from there to Tel-i-Bel: these may be sections of the Hawerki. There are several Syrian (Christian) villages between Narinja and Ghirimira: these are mentioned in the itinerary. Tai Arabs are found near Nisibin. s The following times are reported by a traveller who recently went over the route : Hrs. 0 Jezlret-ibn-'Omar. 8 Narinja. 16 Ghirimira, 20 Nisibin.

ROUTE 98 b JEZIRET-IBN- e OMAR—NISIBIN (73i m. ?) Southern Route, via Aznaie and Deieun Authorities : —Koute reports of autumn 190S and 1907. Koute report of Feb. 1903 from Batirzan onwards (see Military vol. iv, no. 184), It was reported in 1903 that the section of this route between Jezlret-ibn-'Omar and Tel Kharab (m, 50i) was in general impassable for wheels on account of the frequent deep wadis and the rocky, accidented nature of the country, but that field artillery might pass with difficulty, needing help among boulders and at wadis. Prom Tel Kharab to Nisibin there is a good unmetalled road overEOUTES 93 a, b 265 red-brown soil, fit for wheels in the dry season, over nearly level country. The southern route as a whole is said to be difficult in winter on account of mud. Abundant water from springs, streams, and wells. Estimates of water in the streams are for the end of the dry season (early autumn). Excellent grazing. Fuel scarce. Supplies en route very scanty for troops. Camping-grounds near most of the streams. The inhabitants are mainly Kurdish. Hessina Kurds were reported in 1907 between Tel-i-Bel and the boundary of the Jezlret Tcasa (m. 26|), Alya from Batirzan to the Jerrahi Su, and Aznair from Hajilo to Latifeh. Some Syrian Christians are found among the Aznaour.

Route report of 1907, Notes by a traveller who went over the route a few years before the war (exact date uncertain). As far as Tel Hurrin the road is an unmetalled track, passable for carts, over country practically flat, with no impediment to passage of all arms in dry weather; but it is made very heavy by rain. The road is brown soil for 15 m. from Nisibin ; thereafter it is stony. The general direction is WNW. At 4^ m. from Mardln the road begins to ascend, but the ascent is by a metalled car riage-road, systematically graded: this was reported good and the gradients fairly easy in 1903: an authority of 1907 states that the gradients are steep, and the surface is worn in places. In the region of Dara there are said to be alternative roads. A steep range of mountains is on the r. all the way, 2 to 5 m. off, 1,500 ft. or more above the plain : the lower slopes are stony, with some grazing ; the upper slopes have brushwood and trees. Streams are no obstacles ; they are shallow in wide stony beds. Water is found in wells at villages and in streams at Dara and Nisibin (in the dry season of 1903 it was reported that there was hardly any water except in the above-mentioned streams, which were ample for military purposes). Supplies en route sufficient for travellers, but hardly any for military purposes. Camping-grounds at Nisibin and Dara. The country near the route contains fairly numerous villages, the inhabitants being mainly Kurdish, with some Syrian Christians in places.

Before the war this road was at least partially metalled, In 1902 it was reported to be metalled for the first 16^ m. from Mardln and for the last 8| m. into Diarbekr: the former section was then in fairly good order, the latter rough and bad to within about 4 m. from Diarbekr. The unmetalled part was rough and stony and heavy in the rainy season, but on the whole fair in dry weather. Up to the present war the route as a whole was passable for carts but not practicable for carriages in the rains. The T.L. follows the general line of the route. Between Mardln and Khaneki Yuqari supplies are scarce and good water not abundant, but fuel is plentiful.

On this last side it falls steeply to the plain of the Jezlreh. The summit of the plateau is a stony down country interspersed with numerous oak woods. Water is scarce outside the villages and monasteries, where the supply comes largely from pools fed by winter rains and snows. Most of the plateau is very thinly populated. The inhabitants are mainly Jacobite Christians, and there are numerous Jacobite monasteries {deirs). The country has been in a state of unrest duringOM KOUTES 95 c, 96 a 277 the war, and the Christians may have suffered at the hands of the Moslems, who are Kurds.

Northern Main Route via Apshi Authorities:— Military Report on E.T.A., vol. iv, Route 185 (report of 1908). Notes by a traveller who went over the route a few years before the war (exact date uncertain). This is a caravan-route easy on the whole for mules, though too stony and rough for camels. The route leads over the Tur Abdin plateau, where the valleys are level and the hills are low. The only considerable inclines are the descent from the Tur Abdin plateau and the ascent to Mardln. Before the war the road was reported practicable for wheels, though not metalled, as far as Apshi (m. 11^) and good as far as Estel (m. 2^): beyond Apshi, not fit for wheels up to Reshmol (m. 35): from Reshmol to Mardln, passable again for vehicles and metalled. The track near the Seri Hofeh col (see m. 29^~) was rather bad for loaded animals.284 LAND EOUTES The route runs through a comparatively populous and well-culti vated part of the Tur Abdin plateau. Several of the villages passed are of considerable size. All the villages are on hills. Cornfields and many vineyards. Water only from rain: rain-water pools and cisterns at the villages.

The fords are passable without difficulty, except in flood. The track in 1899 was apparently generally easy and passable for wheels, except between Huseinik (in. 81-|) and the Nasr ed-Din bridge (m. 85-|), and a detour to the S. would be necessary for wheeled traffic on that stretch. No information as to recent work on the road is available. Water is on the whole good and plentiful, but supplies are scarce and there is no evidence as to fuel. The country between Ridhwan, Til, and the Nasr ed-Din Kopru would offer a good camping-ground, especially in winter and spring. On the Armenian population compare p. 32.

There is a Mudir here under the Kaimmakam of Zokh, and a post. A well-watered plain extends N. to the Bekan Dagh, 4 m. off, on which are some small villages. Besides the tracks of either bank of the Hazo Su, and that described below, tracks run from Ridhwan as follows : (1) Through a gap in hills to NNW. to Sairtan {Route 102 a, m. 72). Easy and passable for guns. (2) To Qalqalan. See m. 7&amp;| below. This is shorter than the route detailed below. (3) To Hasan Kaif on Tigris over the E. end of the Ashita Dagh. This is for a long distance rough and stony, and the descent to the Tigris gorge is steep. (4) To Til over easy open country, nearer the river than the route described below. This route passes near Khandaq ferry (8 m. SE. from Ridhwan), from which there is a rough track over stony hills to Kefr Joz and Mardln. The present route runs NE. by an easy clay track over undulating country to the foot of the Bekan Dagh. Halik, at the foot of the hills. Large springs. Other villages in neighbourhood, all poor. The plain in 1899 was only partly cultivated, chiefly owing to the lawless ness of the Kurds. On the summit of the Bekan Dagh there are springs, and pasture in summer. The Kurds of the Bekan Dagh belong to the Musikan tribe. Track now along the foot of the Bekan Dagh, stony in places. Sarip, a few Kurdish huts. Qalqalan. Here the shorter track joins from Ridhwan.

The distances given below are by the bridge and the line of the chaussee. From the bridge the road winds along a bluff passing opposite the town, and then strikes across to Tel Alio, whence it descends easily towards the Ambar Chai, which flows in a broad valley and has little water except in freshets in spring. There are several villages, many of them Armenian and Jacobite, and some cultivation, but the country is other wise bare and treeless. Crossing the Ambar Chai the road goes over an easy undu lating country passable in all directions for wheels to the Quru Chai, which it crosses at Khan Bazar. Here several tracks to Farcin diverge and lead roughly parallel over what is apparently an easy undulating country to ENE., with many villages.

The river is crossed by a fine masonry bridge, of one span of 145 ft., the crown of the high pointed arch being 60 ft. above water. The approach on r. bank is bent back at an obtuse angle to the main arch, and in this are four small arches for flood water. The roadway, which has a low parapet, is 20 ft. wide, but is narrowed by a stone gateway 10 ft. wide. In the abutments of the main arch are 2 chambers with windows, reached by a flight of steps from the roadway, meant as living-room for travellers.

It is little used by camels. In its northern part (not covered in this volume) it goes over high passes, one of which rises to nearly 9,000 ft. It has abundant pastures in the early months of the year. There is no information available as to recent work done on this road. To the foot of the hills near Lijjeh is open, rolling country, over which several tracks lead. Miles from Diar- bekr 0 Diarbekr (alt. 1 3 900 ft.). The Tigris is fordable at several points in summer, and a detour of some 6 m. by the bridge can thus be avoided. Leave by the Kharput gate, and turn towards the Tigris valley by a stony cart-road made in the low basaltic cliffs. An easy track leads through the shingly river valley. Ford the Tigris. A guide is necessary. The river-bed is here 200 yds. wide. Channel 80 yds. wide and 2 to 3 ft. deep in August, 1899. Eoad continues diagonally across the valley, passing small villages on either side of the river. Cross some dry ravines from low hills to r. Sherab, 20 houses, ^ m. to r. in a ravine. Leave the river valley and turn up among low hills. Qadi Koi (alt. 2,165 ft.); about 100 houses, with vineyards in a well-cultivated tract. Cross the Ambar Cliai by an easy ford (August).

Eeach Bezwau, a small Kurdish village, the residence in 1900 of an influential Sheikh named Salih. Bezwan is on the southern border of a wide basin through which the Kulp Su winds. 3 m. to the E. the river enters a gorge 40 ft. wide and 30 ft. deep in a broad, rocky ridge, a continuation of that through which the Batman Su passes in a similar gorge. Across this is the bridge of Pir-i-Girto (Pir-i-Qazali), a single masonry arch of 36-ft. span and 18-ft. roadway, with easy approaches. Three large springs rise in the river-bed near the bridge close to the 1. bank. An easy track leads from the bridge, skirting a rocky ridge, to the Pir-i-Kurtik over the Batman Su, crossing about midway the Qabul Jeviz, which in 1900 was unbridged, but generally fordable. Chicheka, small Kurdish village. Shevlara, small Kurdish village. Follow a steep ascent up a rocky ridge, where the road, in 1900, required improvement for wheels. The road then enters a long plain. Pass through extensive walled vineyards belonging to Sirdakkau, a Kurdish village in a ravine to 1. To r. are rocky ridges, sparsely wooded. The Kulp Su flows in an enormous gorge, on the W. of which is a ruined castle on a crag. Eoad now passes along a gravelly plain, draining E.

IY X322 LAND ROUTES KOUTES 112 a, b ACROSS THE EASTERN TAURUS BETWEEN THE REGION OF DIARBEKR AND THE MURAD VALLEY • The region of Diarbekr is separated from the Murad Valley by a high precipitous mountain range extending from Bitlis to the Euphrates Valley near Chunkush. The east end of this range is traversed by the Bitlis Pass (see 85, m. 82|): towards the west, at Arghana Ma'den, the Tigris (Arghana Su) breaks through the mountain in a defile which is followed by the Diarbekr-Kharput chaussee (see Boute 107 at end). Apart from these two crossings, there are but few passes over the hills, and most of those that exist are difficult. The following routes are mentioned : (a)Mountains between Bitlis and Aeghana Ma'den (i) By the Kulp Valley, from Diarbekr or Zokh to Mush (through Pasen). When reported on in 1899 this route was not passable for guns. Near Kulp the track was difficult even for baggage animals. See Military Beport on JE .T .A., vol. iv, 192. It was reported in June, 1916, that a direct road from Diarbekr to Mush Hazro (see Route 106, m. 16-|) was under construction. (ii) By Korka and a col in the Ziyaret Dagh, leading from Lijjeh to Dar-i-Yeni in the Murad Valley (and thence on through the Chabak- chur plain by the Giinek Valley and Oghnat to Erzerum). This route before the war was a mule road much used by caravans in summer when good pasture was obtainable. It apparently crosses the mountains at the easiest point between Bitlis and Arghana Ma'den. When reported on in 1899 it needed improvement in places for guns. Routes from Kharput and Mush join it in the Chabakchur Plain. See Military Beport on E .T .A vol. iv, 195. (iii) By the Kolishan (Kosh Kilan) Pass and Kashan from Lijjeh to Palu (round E. side of the Aq Dagh): a rough hill-track not passable for wheels. See Military Beport o E.T.A., vol. iv, 205. (iv) By the Qara Beighan Basin from Haini to Palu (through Kazak): a hill-track not passable for wheels, apparently rough and difficult in places. A track from Arghana joins this route at Kazak. See Military Beport on E.T.A., vol. iv, 204. {b) West of Arghana Ma'den (i) Arghana Ma'den—Kharput, by Pusherto and W. side of Goljik Lake. This gives the shortest line between Diarbekr and Kharput.ROUTE 112 a, b 323 When reported on in 1901 it was but little more difficult for horses than the chaussee, but was not passable for wheels: it could be improved into a cart-road without difficulty.

Sachau, 1880, The first part of this route, to Severek, is 6 hrs. shorter than the route to Severek via Urfeh {see Eout 123 a, b, and 120 a). The little cart traffic that there was before the war seems to have gone chiefly by Urfeh. From the plateau above Birijik to 'Osman Magribi (m. 18^) the road passes through bare, stony hills, and there were some difficult patches in 1902, passable, however, for guns, though improvement would be required if a regular line of communication were made. Water and supplies apparently scarce. From 'Osman Magribi to Hovek (m. 38^) the country is bare, open, and rather stony. The route is quite easy in dry weather. There is a good deal of cultivation, but water is scarce. The country between Hovek and Qara Juren (m. 65^) is bare, open, and gently undulating. The route is easy, and supplies are fairly plentiful; water fairly good, but no wood fuel. Between Qara Jtiren and Severek (m. 85) the soil is heavy, and in wet weather difficult for men and animals. The country is open and easy, rising gradually with many undulations from Mishmishln (m. 70|), and grazing is excellent (spring). Not much grain. Fuel, tezelc, dry grass, and straw. Water-supply abundant and fairly good. The road Severek—Diarbekr was reported in 1902 to be mostly level, a metalled chaussee in a bad state of repair, the surface being very rough and stony. This section, however, was reported in 1916 to form part of the main line of Turkish road-transport between Jerablus and Diarbekr. The country traversed, except near theROUTE 113 325 Qarajeh Dagh, where it is rough and rocky, is a stony plain. Soil fertile and heavy ; supplies fairly abundant; fuel and brushwood from Qarajeh Dagh. These hills are said to have a bad reputation for severe climate ; von Moltke found snow on them in April, 1837. (The distances given below are perhaps a little under-estimated.)

The distances given from Khalfati have been kept, as the mileage from Rum Qal'ah would probably be about the same. The track runs through easy, undulating country, with a good deal of wheat, barley, and vine cultivation. The only difficulties in movement are caused by occasional ravines.

This is a shorter but more difficult route to Mardln than that by Tel Ermen (see Boute 116 b). It is also better supplied with water, and villages are more plentiful. From Veiran Shehr to Derek the country for first 15 m. is a fertile, cultivated plain, which then becomes undulating and very stony. The route all the way is winding and stony, bad for horses and impossible for carts. The five streams crossed are all of the same character, rising in the Qarajeh Dagh and flowing S. in narrow rocky valleys. They cannot be forded in flood, and are all dry in summer. From Derek to Mardln the track is in many parts rough and stony, and very heavy after rain on the Mazi Dagh plateau. Water and supplies are very scarce throughout.

This is an alternative route to the more northerly track by Derek. It traverses much easier and more level country, but the last few miles are very steep and stony and fit only for pack-animals. The route is reported to be badly supplied with water, except in spring and early summer when there is a fair supply, and pasture is abundant. A traveller who made the journey in 1908, however, was told by his zaptichs that the streams for some miles before Tel Ermen (m. 49) were perennial. There is wheat, barley, and millet cultivation at the villages along the route, and the soil as a whole appears to be fertile. The crops are ripe about the end of June. Fodder is plentiful, but fuel scarce. The heat in the middle of summer is very great, and at that season a different route is followed from near Meshquq (m. 35). See Boute 116 c.

The following are cross-country routes, of which 117 a may be the easiest. This route is the most easterly, 117 c being apparently the most westerly of the three. KOUTE 117 a VEIRAN SHEHR—DIARBEKR B etween the M azi D agh and Q ara.teh D agh Authority ; —Information communicated with regard to a journey made in December 1908. This route leaves the Veiran Shehr—Derek road, apparently in the neighbourhood of Arbeta (see 116 a, m. 171): but this is very uncertain. It takes a line between the Mazi Dagh on the E. and the Qarajeh Dagh on the W., passing W. of Derek. The country traversed is less broken than that on the Derek—Diarbekr road. On the edges of the plain, before the spurs of Qarajeh Dagh are crossed, a small Kurdish settlement is passed, near which is a limestone cave with a spring having a perennial water-supply and a stream running out of it. This would be a suitable place for troops to MES. IV y338 LAND ROUTES camp in. It may be Arbeta. A wooded region is crossed before the plain of Diarbekr is reached. The Veiran Shehr—Derek road is said to be impassable for carts, but the rest of the route might apparently be practicable for light artillery and carts. By following the southern Veiran Shehr—Mardln road (Boute 116 b) as far as Tel Helali, and thence striking N., crossing the Veiran Shehr—Derek road, a through route passable for wheels might be obtained.

This is a limestone region. The route before the war was apparently passable for 2-wheeled carts and guns but not for 4-wheeled vehicles. The most difficult part of the route is in the Tektek Dagh where the road is rough and stony. After running through the Tektek Dagh the track passes over level country, crossing a number of streams flowing from the Qarajeh Dagh. Many of these have steep, cliff-like descents on either side and would require clearing of rocks for wheeled transport. Except near Urfeh where villages are numerous the country is inhabited chiefly by Milli Kurds who come up N. in summer to the slopes of the Qarajeh Dagh in search of water for their flocks. The heat in summer is very great and water is so scarce that at that season this road would be useless for military operations. The lack of water is greatest in the Tektek Dagh. Between those hills and Urfeh some of the streams which flow from the Qarajeh Dagh may have water even in autumn, but most of them apparently dry up in the course of the summer. Fuel is very scarce, but grazing is good and large numbers of horses and camels should be obtainable. (The distances given below from the Hep. vol. iv, appear to be under estimated. Compare Appendix, below.) Miles from ITrfeh. 0 Urfeh. Leave in E. by N. direction.

This is the more northerly of the two routes to Urfeh. It is generally fairly easy, but in places rough, stony, and heavy in wet weather. It was regularly used in 1908 for carts, both for passengers and merchandise. By 1914 the road had not been metalled for the first part of the way except for a short distance outside Birijik. The last third of the road before reaching Urfeh is a well-engineered chaussee, which would be considered good in any country. In 1903 it was reported that it was less used than the route SerQj (see Eoute 123 b), owing to the insecurity of the country and the in completeness of the chaussee, but conditions may have altered in the interval. Between Birijik and Char Melik, 21 m., the country is open, bare and undulating; the soil heavy; much cultivation; villages fairly numerous but small and miserable. Water from wells; supplies scarce.

In 1903 it was reported that most of the traffic to Urfeh, including arabehs, went by this route, owing to the incomplete state of the xhaussee by Char Melik and the insecurity of the country. Con ditions may have changed in the interval, as the Char Melik route now appears to be fairly good (see introduction to 123 a), and the death of Ibrahim Pasha may have been followed by greater security. It is, however, inhabited by Berazieh Kurds, who were MES. IV Z354. LAND ROUTES formerly predatory (see under their head-quarters, Seruj, m. 27, below). The route should be passable throughout for wheels, though heavy carts might have difficulty in using it in winter, when there is a good deal of mud. In summer they should have little difficulty. Moreover, it was reported in 1916 that the main line of Turkish road-transport from Jerablus to Diarbekr passed through Seruj (m. 27) and Urfeh. There are a good many streams and water is plentiful in winter, while villages are numerous, and there is much cultivation, at any rate in the neighbourhood of Seruj. There is hardly any wood along the route. An authority of 1912 says that there is a longer but better route which makes a sweep SE. through the plains, skirts the Seruj Dagh, and then runs K along the E. side of the Nimrud Dagh.

Most of the villages have small groves of poplars. Fuel used is corn-stalks and cow-dung. Plenty of grain ; sheep and goats on hills ; some fine 14-hand horses bred here. The language spoken is chiefly Kermanji, but a good many of the inhabitants speak Arabic. Turkish is a little spoken (1903). Seruj is the head-quarters of the Kurds of the Berazieh tribe, who are reputed to have 10,000 warriors and used to be at feud with the Milli.

There seems to be no available evidence as to the details of the route between Urfeh and Tel Ahmar. The track is said to diverge from the Urfeh—Birijik road {via Seruj) not far from Urfeh. It passes over some stony undulations, but runs mainly across stoneless plain, where there is a good deal of mud in winter. The route should be passable throughout for light or moderate wheeled traffic, though the heavy going might cause difficulty for heavy carts in winter. In summer the route for such transport should be easy. It might be made passable for motor-cars but not for lorries. There are numerous stream-beds and water is plentiful in winter. In December 1908 there was a large pond some hundred yards in diameter to the 1. of the track just where it left the Seruj plain. This looked as if it might provide a good water-supply at all seasons. There is a good deal of cultivation and villages are numerous. There is hardly any wood along the entire route. This region is inhabited by Berazieh Kurds, a strong tribe that some years ago were on bad terms with the Milli.INTERIOR OF NORTHERN JEZlREH, WEST OF THE JAGHJAGHA SU (wiT) ROUTE 125 DEIE EZ-ZOK—NISIBIN (160 m.) Via The Jaghjagha Su Authorities: —Oppenheim, August 1893; Sarre and Herzfeld ? ^rcMo%tsc/ie Reise (journey of 1907). The route from Tel Hesekeh runs generally close along the r. bank of the Jaghjagha, which in low-water has an average breadth of only 20 ft., but even in August is so deep that it can be forded only at a few points. The water is fairly clear and the bed of the stream is not nearly so deeply cut as that of the Khabur, so that in flood the neighbouring country must be flooded to a great distance. Even in summer the banks are nearly everywhere covered with reeds or low tamarisk scrub. It is fed by streams from the Tur Abdin. The country N. of Tel Hesekeh is for some miles flat like that of the Khabur, and then becomes undulating. It rises gradually towards Nisibin, and is drained by several small streams.

There is said to be a well-used road between Mardln and Ras el- Ain, but it is not clear which of the alternatives below is the more important. The first few miles are very rough and steep, but after the plain is reached there do not appear to be any serious difficulties. Water is probably scarce in the l.w. season when the are dry, and no supplies or fuel are available. The stage (reversed) from m. 56 to m. 12f probably represents approximately part of a Turkish line of march between Ras-el-Ain, Nisibin and Mosul reported in January 1916. The marching time from Ras el-Ain to Tel Ermen was given in two stages of 7 hrs. each. From Tel Ermen the march was continued to Amudeh {Route 94, m. 17), leaving Mardln to the N.

The river Belikh, the general course of which is followed from Raqqah to Harran, is a deep narrow stream, fordable only at a few points even in the l.w. season. It could easily be bridged, A report of 1906 says that the Afadle had built a bridge of twigs and branches bound together into fascines, near El-Hamreh, a short MES. IV A tl370 LAND EOUTES distance above the junction of the river with the Euphrates. The average depth is about 8 ft. and the breadth about 30 ft. The current is moderate and the banks generally soft and spongy. The country on both banks is said to be passable for wheels except in wet weather. The burrows made by jerboas, however, make fast movement impossible. There are two routes to Harran; one on the E. and the other on the W. of the stream. Both keep well away from the river owing to the numerous canals and the soft nature of the soil. The eastern track runs generally closer to the river, and that side of the valley is said to be higher than on the W., while there are no lakes such as are to be found on the W. bank. The breadth of the valley generally varies from 1 to 3 m., but in a good many places it is as much as 7-9 m. wide. The territory on either bank is divided into grazing districts, each with its own name. These tracts may be 10 m. long. Barley, maize, rice, millet, hemp, and opium can be cultivated with success, and it is reported that with settled government the whole district watered by the river could, as in former days, support a large population. At present the feuds of the Anazeh and Shammar make development impossible. Many of the settlements are tent-villages, and are consequently liable to alter their position from year to year.

Authorities ; —Hinrichs, 1911; Miss GL Bell, Arnurath (journey of 1908). This track appears to be little used, though there is a caravan-road all the way to Birijik. There is no evidence available as to the state of the track as far as m. 80|. Beyond that point there has been some road-making, and the track is easy and probably passable for wheels. Water is plentiful, either from the river or from streams, and fodder is good in spring.

Yia E l -B ab and M embij Authorities .-—Miss G-. Bell (journey of 1908), E. Sachau (journey of 1879). This was formerly a regular caravan-route for Urfeh and Mosul but for some years fell into disuse owing to danger from nomads.' In 1908, however, it was coming into use again as a result of strict measures taken by the Government. There is no made road, but the surface is good, over undulating loamy country as far as the Euphrates, and the going is good except in wet weather. A Koman road, probably constructed by Septimus Severus, apparently followed this route, and Roman milestones have been found at Arimeh (see below, m. 40i). This Eoman road probably followed the line of an earlier road of Seleucid times. The country is thickly set with villages, of which very few are marked on the maps. The district is naturally very fertile with an adequate rainfall, and sub-soil water at no great depth nearly every where.

In 1908 the whole of this district as far as Membij was under the DcCirates-Samyeli, and occupied mainly by Circassian colonists planted here by the Sultan, who had acquired the land gradually.

Membij, Mumbij, or Bumbij, a Circassian village (T.O.) on the site of the ancient Hierapolis, the sacred city which was the chief centre of the worship of the nature-goddess Atargatis. Just inside the walls is a large pond, choked with masonry, and showing the remains of stairs by which the worshippers of Atargatis used to descend in order to swim out to the altar in the middle of the pool. The temple was sacked by Crassus on his Parthian campaign in 53 b.c. In the third century the city was one of the great cities of Syria, but was in ruins when the Emperor Julian marched through to Mesopotamia in 363. Later it fell into the hands of Chosroes I (Nushirwan the Just), and was restored by Harun el-Rashid at the end of the eighth century. The Crusaders captured it from the Seljuks in the twelfth century, Saladin retook it in 1175, and it was finally ruined by the Mongols under Hulagu. Nearly all the remains visible are of late date. From Membij the road lies across country thickly dotted with villages. 'Very few of these are marked on the maps. Manqabeh. and 'Wardaneli are named as two villages on the N., and 'Ain Nakhleh. as a third on the S. side of the road.

This route is passable for wheels, and is probably still the main caravan-route towards Urfeh and Diarbekr, though the route by El-Bab, Membij, and Tel Ahmar, abandoned for some years owing to the unsettled state of the country, has been coming into use again recently.

Sacliau (journey of 1879) ; D, G. Hogarth, quary's Life (journey of 1908), The Sajur valley is nowhere broader than about 3 or 3-| m. and consists of fertile alluvial deposit which produces excellent crops ofROUTES 139, 140 387 hemp, millet, wheat, and barley. There is a good deal of artificial irrigation. The inhabitants in 1880 were chiefly Beni Sa'id Arabs, who possessed cattle, sheep, and goats. The valley also supplied asses for the whole of Syria. Most of the villages are on the 1. bank. In 1908 Turkoman camps were met with. The river during its course winds very considerably between lime stone hills, but keeps generally nearer the N. than the S. side of the valley. It remains about the same breadth, 15-25 ft., from its mouth up to where the Aleppo—Birijik caravan-route crosses it. In l.w. it is nowhere very deep, and can easily be forded. Holes are to be seen in the rock formation at various points, possibly Hittite quarries.

The next stage is extremely monotonous. The track runs NW. or WNW. Spring. The banks become gradually flatter, rising only here and there into low hills. In 1880 tent-settlements here began to give way to houses. Numerous villages. A track here crosses the Sajur from IST. to S.

Authority: — Military Report on Arab Route 18 (report of 1903). This route was described Jn 1903 as suitable for pack-animals only, but it could easily be made fit for carts, except at the Wassa and Sajur rivers, where a good deal of work would be necessary. It is rather stony in parts, as detailed below, and where the ground is plain soil it would become impassable after rain. The neighbouring country is generally open and passable by all arms. Supplies are plentiful near Killis, and from Anaz to the Kuweik (m. 19) moderate quantities are obtainable, though the villages are small. Supplies from m. 19 to m. 46 are fair, but from m. 46 to Jerablus there are practically none to be had from the military point of view. Water sufficient for military purposes. No wood for fuel.

(i) The northern route leads up the Urik valley for about 1-| m. and thence E. across a rocky plateau and NE. over some streams to Petirgo in the Gerger Chai valley (about 7 m. from Urik). Mishrakh. lies about 2-I m. ESE. of Petirgo on the other side of the Gerger Chai. (ii) The southern route goes SE. to Qara Tut by a hilly track (about 5 m. from Urik), and thence over rolling ground, crossing several hollows and ravines. The track works round to NE. about 2 m. beyond Qara Tut and reaches Mishrakh. about 6-7 m. further on. It is therefore about 2 m. longer than the northern route.KOUTES 150 a, b ' 409 From Mishrakh the track leads over undulations on the S. side of the Gerger valley, crossing a number of small streams flowing to the Gerger Chai.

EOUTE 150 b ADIAMAN—GEKGEK Via T okariz Authority: —Ainsworth (1837). This route, which lies S. of Boute 150 a, and for which distances cannot be given, leads generally E. and NE. through nearly level grassy plains which fall to the Euphrates, similar to the country W. of Adiaman but with deeper valleys and larger streams (June). The clay soil, under the heat of the sun, is cracked into large fissures. The route passes a good many small villages with groups of fig and pomegranate trees. There is practically no cultivation, but cattle are pastured. Ainsworth took three days on the journey. At the end of the first day Kerkuneh, Kurdish village with orchards, was passed. A short distance further the Kiaklita Su is crossed by an easy ford; the river is here in three channels (June); when in flood it is over ^ m. wide. The rock-walls on both sides are clothed with wild fig and mulberry trees. Koute then traverses uplands covered with luxuriant vegetation of oats, rye, and grasses, peculiarly favourable for horse-rearing. The second day's journey ended at Tokariz, a Kurdish village surrounded by a mud wall. Route continues generally NE. to the foot of the hills, where it descends into the deep vale of Chamuni and ascends a very steep and rocky height. Oldish village. A rude path continues on the side of a rocky acclivity, and a small pass is reached near the crest of the hills, defended by a wall and towers now dilapidated. From beyond the pass is seen the open wooded vale of Gerger Kalesi, hemmed in by the Ashur Dagh and other heights, at no great distance, and a descent is made to Gerger.

The country is open and fairly easy for wheels; it consists of rolling downs traversed by streams from N. Eoute at first follows a stream, crossing and recrossing. At 3 hrs. it reaches Birgami, Kurdish village, whence a very good bridle path continues over rolling hills to Harras, Kurdish village (4^ hrs.). At 5 hrs. descend into a plain, and reach Samsat in 5| hrs. from Adiaman. EOUTES 151a, b,c ACROSS THE TAURUS BETWEEN THE EUPHRATES AND MAR ASH That part of the Taurus range which lies between Mar ash and the Euphrates is very difficult, and before the war was not traversed by any good road. {a) The easiest line seems to be that by Pelvereh (or Paurelu), NE. of Belveren. In the basin SW. of Pelvereh, which contains a chain of three lakes (Chinar Gr6l, Ma'den Gol, and Bash Gol), routes meet from Serai Koi (see Route 147 (ii), m. 78-=-), Belveren, and Behisni. The pass N. of Pelvereh is about 4,500 ft. high. There may be a metalled chaussee throughout from Marash to Malatiyeh (110 m.) —the first 40 and last 30 m. of this route are certainly metalled. See Handbook of Cilicia, &amp;c., in preparation, and E.T.A., vol. iv, Routes 156, 156 a. (&amp;) W. of the Pelvereh Pass the following tracks are mentioned:— (1) A very rough mountain track leading from Bazarjiq to Albistan. (2) Prom Marash to Albistan along the Jeihan valley by Derbend Khan and Ali Shehr: the shortest caravan-route between Marash and Albistan. Very difficult along the Jeihan valley. See Military Report on E .T .A., vol. iv. 167. (3) From Mar ash to Albistan by Zeitun, diverging from the 'Ali Shehr route at the Hamidiyeh bridge over the Jeihan river. This is the longer but easier route. The road to Zeitun could beEOUTES 150c-152 v 411 made passable for guns with little difficulty. See Report E.T.A., vol. iv, JRoute 171. (4) A hill-track to Goksun by Takir Khan, a mule-track varying from fair to bad in different parts. See E.T.A. vol. iv, Boute 168. (c) E. of the Pelvereh Pass a number of mule-tracks cross the hills, of which the following are perhaps the most important:— (1) From Adiaman to Malatiyeh. Bolam. See on E.T.A., vol. iv, Route 174. (2) From Kiakhta to Malatiyeh by the Tekkeh Dereh; very rough. See Military Report on E.T.A vol. iv, 175. ROUTE 152 ALEPPO—MAE'ASH (For details see Handbook of Gilicia, &amp;c., in preparation.) Between Aleppo and Killis the country consists of rolling culti vated ground of a reddish loamy soil, over which, it is said, in the neighbourhood of the Tel Arfad road, guns could march in line, even after heavy rain, all the way to Killis. A chaussee runs from Aleppo to Killis Azaz ; another and shorter route more to the E. runs by Tel Arfad, joining the chaussee at 4 m. from Killis. Lastly, easy though somewhat cir cuitous roads lead to Killis from Akhterin (see 139). At Killis the chaussee from Alexandretta joins. From Killis to 'Aintab the chau continues over easy undu lating country. From 'Aintab to Mar'ash, it was intended in 1904 to continue the chaussee : in any case the country is easy, and little work would be needed to make the road passable for wheels.KAIL WAY ALEPPO—EAS EL-'AIN—TEL EEMEN Authorities: —For the section Aleppo—Jerablus and the bridge across the Euphrates, Report on Baghdad Railway, May 1914. For the section Jerablus— Kas el-'Ain, a report of January 1916. The line runs over undulating country to Jerablus. The most difficult portion of this section is the descent to and ascent beyond the Sajur (m. 54|), where there is a gradient of 12 per mille (1 in 83 approximately) for 1^ m. on each side of the river. This is the r ulin g gradient of the section Aleppo—Jerablus. Maximum curve, 500 metres. The earthwork is generally very light. The distances beyond 'Arab Punar are very uncertain. Stations where completed are all of good solid masonry of German style. All walls are about 23-| in. (60 cm.) thick of cut stone (as far as Jerablus) or concrete bricks (from Jerablus onwards) to afford protection against armed attack. Stone quarters are built for the staff. The road bed is designed when completed to be 9 ft. 10 in. (3 metres) wide on top and 14| in. (40 cm.) deep. It is generally made in three layers: bottom ballast, 6^ in. (17 cm.). Gravel basalt and other local stone is used. Top ballast is broken to 3-in. gauge. The quantity works out at approximately 1 cubic metre per running metre. The ballasting may be scamped in places ; it is asserted that this is the case beyond Tel Abyadh. Gauge, 4 ft. 8-| in. The rails are flat-bottomed vignoles, heavy section (about 75 lb. per yd. ?), 15 cm. (5-906 in.) in height, 40-42 ft. in length. The section of rail will take a very heavy engine. Steel sleepers, 16 to a rail length, equally spaced, except in the case of the end sleeper at the joint.. The rails are fastened to sleepers by a clip on the outside, and bolt and flat clip on the inside. Fish plates are of a long heavy angle pattern with six bolts. A portion is cut out of the angle near each end to give clearance for the rail-holding-down bolt. Angle turn-outs are 1 in 10 and 1 in 12 at each station. Block system of working is used, with levers in frame fixed outside station- master's office at the stations. All points are hand-worked. ThereKAILWAY 413 are home and distant signals, with discs, about 15 ft. high. The dis tant signal is worked by the sauie wire as the home signal, double wire being used, which is wound two or three turns round a wheel at the foot of each signal. The main type of truck is of the four-wheeled box type. Trucks are roofed and closed, 88 ft. long, 86 ft. over buffers. All have the following capacity and measurement:— 40 men. 37 cubic metres. 18 metres surface. Tare, 8,000-9,000 kilos ; load, 15,000 kilos. Several have a small guard's seat covered over at one end of the truck as on the Italian and other continental railways. The centre of buffer is 8 ft. 3 in. above rail. Ordinary screw coupling with side buffers. Rails for construction were mostly carried in ballast trucks, low sided shorts of 10 tons. Coaches on this section early in 1914 were of the old Anatolian Kail- way type, with capacity for 50 men. Only 12 or 15 were seen in May 1914. Only a few of the coaches and trucks had the through brake pipes. No full information as to the numbers and types of engines. On the Aleppo—Jerablus section engines built by Borsig (Berlin), type 2-6-0, are used : probably over 15 tons per axle, with six-wheeled tender. For the telegraph line ordinary fir-poles are used : two wires only. Miles from Aleppo o Aleppo. The station (1st class) lies about 500 yds. NE. of the branch terminus, and is connected therewith by a single line 300 yds. long, on a 20-ft. bank, under which pass two roads, about 200 yds. apart: (i) The main road to Alexandretta (metalled) passes under a 30-ft. span steel bridge (2 box girders) with footway. This is at the end of the French station. (ii) A newly constructed road leads from the German station under the line to the back of the goods shed on NW. side: a branch (unmetalled) runs W. This is spanned by a reinforced concrete bridge, 80-ft. span. The buildings of Aleppo station are solidly built of stone and two-storied in the centre, and are about 150 yds. long. There is a main platform 200 yds. long and extensive sidings, with seven main loops, up to 500 yds.414 KAILWAY Miles from Aleppo 9 12: in length. In May 1914 only temporary corrugated galvanized iron buildings were in use for engine sheds, &amp;c. At the S. end of the NW. side of the line were a straight engine shed with turn-table, and a small goods shed. The permanent stone engine-shed, circular in form, to hold 12 engines, was being built at the N. end of the station, and a large space, 450 yds. by 100 yds., was being cleared for permanent locomotive shops. There was a large goods shed, 120 yds. long, on the NW. side, approached by road no. (ii) mentioned above. Consider able stacks of railway material and perhaps 200 tons of coal (briquettes and coal dust). Two gantries. Large water-tower on SE. side, by main station buildings. Easy grades out of Aleppo. At nearly 1 m. (1^ km.) line crosses road by a bridge. A short temporary line (May 1914) leading off to W. into ballast quarry (facing points from Muslimiyeh). The railway to about m. 6^ follows the contours of the low gravel hills 100 ft. high on the r. bank of the Kuweik river. These form the western watershed.

Six loop sidings (the longest 500-600 yds., shortest 280 yds. ; one with two dead ends). From here onwards the country is an open plain, 5-6 m. wide, mostly under wheat, with gently undulating sur face. On leaving Muslimiyeh the line makes a sweep to NE., rising at easy gradient (1 in 166) for rather over ^ m. The undulations become more definite, and one or two villages are passed in the folds of the ground to SE. There are hills rising 200 ft. above the plain. The line falls slightly for over ^ m., and strikes the valley of the Kuweik, here flowing SW. Line follows up r. bank.

The line bends round to S. of the Karkemish mound to reach the bridge. Jerablus bridge across the Euphrates. This bridge, which was unfinished at the beginning of the war, is said to be now completed. The length of the bridge is about 884 yds. (816 metres). It consists of 10 spans, with an overhead lattice girder. The width is 20 ft., 15 ft. for railway and 4 ft. for pathway outside. The founda tions consist of cement concrete lowered into a water tight iron casing made of interlocking piling 45 ft. by 20 ft. in plan. The top of this piling is at low-water level, above which the pier is of smaller section. The concrete goes right up to the bed-plate of the bridge, and is stone-faced outside. In the sandy bed of the river the concrete is about 42%ft. (13 metres) deep. In other places it is on rock foundations. An earth bank with a stone-wall foundation has been made on the r. bank of the river above the bridge to prevent the flood from washing away the railway bank to the W. of the western pier of the bridge. It was reported in May 1914 that it looked very probable that a big flood would wash out the bank and then damage the west abutment.

There are gardens, vineyards, and oliveyards round the town. It is a well-built place with stone housed most of which are two-storied and have flat roofs: many of them are built round courtyards. The streets are 15—25 ft. wide, and paved. There are several khans in the town. To the south are heights, one of which is occupied by a ruined castle, another by the American Mission College (Central Turkey College), and a third by the mission hospital. The mission buildings are substantial stone structures. Hygiene. —Ophthalmia and the Aleppo 1 button are common, but the latter is said not to attack persons living on the heights above the town. For the water-supply, see below. Supplies and Commerce. —As the town is the centre of an exceed ingly fertile district it would be an important base for supplies and transport. Water of good quality is brought from the neighbouring hill by an old aqueduct, and is distributed by fountains throughout the town. The well-water is generally bad. The well at the American College is 120 ft. deep, and is worked by a wind-pump; bare#are also used for obtaining water. Wood is scarce, but charcoal is brought into the town for sale. The bazaars before the war were good, and the place was noted for its striped cotton cloths and grape syrup {jpekmez). Inhabitants. —The Moslem population appears to be principally Turkish. There is (or was) a large Armenian community. The Christian element in the town was estimated in 1904 at one-half of the whole population, and in 1911 at about one-third, but deportations d d 2420 GAZETTEEE OF TOWNS were reported in the latter part of 1915.

General Description. —Aleppo, the chief town of Northern Syria, lies in the valley of the Kuweik, extending over undulating ground, with hills to W. and rising ground to E. Through the western part of the city flows the Kuweik river, which is dry in summer, yet well stocked with fish at other seasons. It is.bordered with ash, maple, plane, silver poplar, tichlc, sumach, walnut, quince, pistachio, and olive trees. The tow T n was unfortified before the present war ; portions of the old walls are still standing, but the city has spread far beyond them. The streets, which form a tangled labyrinth, are on the whole clean, and often are well paved and have side-walks. A characteristic feature is the frequency of passages with pointed arches. The bazaars are roofed generally with stone, sometimes with wood: they'AINTAB—ALEPPO 421 lie W. of the old citadel. The houses, which are usually one- storied, are solidly built of freestone. The best quarter is that of Azlziyeh, lying to the NW. on the r. bank of the river. Here before the war were the residences of the European consuls. To the W., on the 1. bank of the river, are the suburbs of Selimiyeh, (where is the residence of the Vali), El-Kittab (the Christian- Levantine quarter), and Mechareka. At the SW. of the town (on the r. bank) is the quarter known as El-Kelarsi. These western quarters are bounded by and interspersed with gardens and orchards. To SE. of the Aziziyeh quarter are the Christian quarters of Sallbeh and El-Jedeideh, and S. of these is Bahsita, the Jewish quarter. The railway stations (the German station of the Baghdad railway and the terminus of the French line to Homs) lie W. of the river. The old citadel stands in the centre of the town on an artificial mound 100 ft. high, the summit of which is oval, measuring 300 yds. from W. to E. and 200 yds. from N. to S. The mound is surrounded by a deep moat which can be filled with water. A road runs above the counterscarp lined by well-built stone houses. The slopes of the mound are too steep to scale except at the approach on the S. side. Here a massive bridge leads to an entrance-gate, within which is a flight of stone steps and above these a winding slope to the top of the mound. The summit of the mound is surrounded by a ruined stone parapet 15-20 ft. high. The magazine is described as being underneath the rampart to the r. of the main gate (entrance- gate at the foot of the slope ?), its door being the first on the r. from this gate. It is sunk below the ground and well protected. Water in the citadel is obtained from a deep well. The citadel commands the town, and is itself commanded by the hills to the W. S. of it is a smaller eminence, on which is a mosque. The barracks occupy another mound, about 600 yds. NE. of the old citadel, measuring on its summit about 600 yds. by 175 yds. The buildings are a two-storied block occupying three sides of a quadrangle. The men live in the upper story, the stables being in the lower. The ventilation is very bad. Besides the ordinary native khans there are a number of hotels more or less of the European kind. Climate and Hygiene. —The air is pure and dry and this part of the country is on the whole healthy. The heat of summer is rather severe, as the hills to the W. partially shut off the cool winds from the sea. The winter climate is cold enough to prevent orange-trees from flourishing. Snow falls fairly often, but does not lie long. Strangers may suffer from the 1 Aleppo button ' which is similar to the ' Basra date-markthe ' Baghdad boil', &amp;c. (see vol. i, p. 45).422 GAZETTEEE OF TOWNS Supplies and Commerce. —To the N. of Aleppo along the Kuweilc the country is apparently well cultivated, and the plain of Killis is especially fertile (see under Killis) Agriculture has also been increasing in the district between Aleppo and the Euphrates, and villages there are now fairly numerous. Definite estimates of supplies are lacking. The water-supply is from the Kuweik, from Halian (9 m. to N.) by a conduit, and from wells. Cotton and silk tissues, calico embroidery, lace work, and soap are the chief manufactures. Wheat, barley, oats, lentils, and peas, cotton, pistachios, liquorice root, and tobacco are among the chief crops of the Aleppo district. The Ottoman Bank, the Deutsche Orient Bank, and an agency of the Banque de Salonique are the principal banking establishments at Aleppo. For road-transport, besides pack-animals (camels, mules, donkeys), fourgons, or springless wagons, can be had; their maximum capacity is 3-5 tons. Inhabitants. —Some two-thirds of the inhabitants are Moslems. The remainder are Armenians, Greeks, Jews, Syrian Catholics, Jacobites, and Maronites, but the numbers of the sects are very variously given in estimates, and as regards the Armenian popula tion especially, reference may be made to the note on p. 32. There was a large European colony here before the war. Arabic is gener ally spoken. Administration and Authorities. —Aleppo is the chief town of the Vilayet of the same name, and is therefore the residence of the Vali. Before the war Great Britain, France, Russia, the U.S.A., Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy, Holland, Spain, and Belgium all maintained consuls here. History. —There seems to have been a town on the site of Aleppo since at least 2000 b.c. In the Macedonian, Eoman, and Byzantine periods it was a fairly important place under the name of Beroea. After the Arab conquest it increased in importance as a centre of traffic between East and West, and in spite of earthquakes, sieges, and sacks by Mongols it flourished throughout the Middle Ages and later. Here European merchants came for the Persian and Indian trade. In the Middle Ages the French and Venetians had factories at Aleppo. The discovery of the Cape route to India to some extent affected Aleppo, but it was still a great commercial centre in the time of James I, when a British factory was established here. In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the town was disturbed and impoverished by the fights between factions, which the Turkish Government failed to control. The opening of the land route to India across Egypt, and then the making of the Suez Canal, helped to divert trade from Aleppo.atif) ALEPPO—AMADIYEH 423 With the increase of the Turkish power in Syria Aleppo revived, and before the war it seemed likely to receive great commercial benefit from the new railways which were being built or planned. It is situated at the point where the Syrian railway system meets the system of the Baghdad railway. It was said before the war that the Turks have regarded Aleppo as a possible capital if they should be driven out of Europe. AMADIYEH. About ^ 55 m. N. by E. of Mosul. Pop. 2,000- 3,000. P.O.

General Description. —Amadiyeh lies just below the southern edge of the high mountain country of Central Kurdistan. The country to S. of it, though hilly, is much more open, and the ranges are much lower than those to N. The town is built on a rocky plateau, an outlier from the southern side of the steep and loity Ser Amadiyeh. The plateau, which is connected with the range to JN. only by a narrow rocky col, is oval in shape, 1,400 yds. long and 550 yds. broad. Its summit inclines slightly to the W., and ^ almost entirely of rock. Its slopes in their upper part rise in clifts 50-«U tt. high, and in their lower part, which is clay, are steep and strewn with boulders. Two narrow roads lead up to the town, and enter it, the one by a gateway on the W. side of the plateau, the other by a gate to the NE. The town itself lies at the K end of the plateau. It'is now for the most part in ruins, only 400-500 houses being inhabited. The remainder of the plateau is occupied by a cemetery. At the E. gate is a large building in a dilapidated condition, but solidly built of stone, used as the offices of the administration and as a zaptieh barrack. An old, solidly-built minaret rises above t e town.424 GAZETTEEK OF TOWNS At the south end of the plateau is a ruined Kurdish castle, with masonry wall and two bastions, 3-4 ft. thick and 20 ft. high. This wall is drawn across the plateau, cutting off a space of about 200 yds. wide. Along the edge of the cliff is a low masonry wall with embrasures and loopholes, having a fine command over the country to the S. The plateau can be commanded from a spur of the main range 1,500 yds. from the E. gate. Amadiyeh has now little importance except as a route-centre. Hygiene. —There is said to be a liability to fever in the hot summer months. Supplies and Commerce. —The bazaar, built partially among ruins, is small and ill-supplied. Some rice and millet are grown in the neighbourhood ; also tobacco, grapes, mulberries, pomegranates, and walnuts. Dried fruits, cheese, and curds and whey have been noticed on sale. Water comes from springs, one of which is on the slope about 100 yds. outside the W. gate. There are no springs on the summit of the plateau, but one account mentions wells as situated there, the water of which is mostly bad in summer. Water is also brought in skins on donkeys from the stream in the valley. There is some trade in gall-nuts, and there are smiths' shops for the repair of Kurdish weapons and knives. There are also some weavers' shops kept by Jews. Inhabitants. —The population consists for the most part of Kurds. There are besides some Jews and a few Nestorians. (Before the war the English Mission to the Nestorians had a station at Bibaydi on the Dohuk road, about 3 m. from the town.) In summer most of the inhabitants migrate to camps of booths on the mountain Administration. —Amadiyeh is the head-quarters of a haza. Its Kaimmakam is under Mosul. BASH QAL AH. About T 50 m.

(iv) To Van via Khoshab. (See JRouies 74 a and b.) (v) To Dilman, (See JRoute 75.) (vi) To Dizeh. (See Route 65.) General Description. —Bash Qarah lies on the W. edge of a culti vated plain which on the E. stretches to the Zab (here generally called the Albak Su) about 5 m. distant. Immediately W. of the town rises a steep range of hills, and some of the houses are built on the lower slopes. On a spur above the town are the ruins of a Kurdish castle which are clearly visible for some miles on the road from Julamerk. Many of the houses are well built of sun-dried brick, and the principal streets are wide and fairly clean. The Turkish barracks are in the centre of the town : they consist of two low buildings of sun-dried brick. The importance of Bash Qal'ah arises from its position in a fertile plain at the junction of roads from Van, from Dilman across the Persian frontier, and from the Hakkiari country to the S. and SW. For this reason it was before the war a Turkish military centre, and its garrison had to watch both the tribes of the Persian frontier and those in the mountains to the S. Climate. —The high altitude and exposed position of Bash Qal'ah make its winter climate extremely severe, and snow lies until late in the year. Supplies and Commerce. —The cultivated plain towards the Zab is irrigated by several streams from the N., and produces wheat, barley, millet, and sesame. Fruit and vegetables are usually brought from the Salmas plain and from Urmia. Excellent grass is found in the spring and early summer in meadows along the Zab and on the neighbouring slopes. Water is to be obtained from several springs at the foot of the hills and from streams. There is a small bazaar frequented by the tribesmen of the neigh bouring mountain regions. Good smith's and carpenter's work is done here. Bash Qal'ah was before the war an important point of transit for caravans going between Urmia and Van. Inhabitants. —The town is inhabited principally by Kurds, but there were considerable Armenian and Jewish communities and also a few Persians. There was a massacre of Armenians and Nestorians in the town and district in the summer of 1915. Administration. —Bash Qal'ah was the seat of government of the Hakkiari Scmjaq in the Vilayet of Van, and was therefore under a Mutessarif. The garrison in summer consisted of one or two battalions of Nizam and a mountain battery.426 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS BEHISNI (Besne). About v 40 m. WNW. of Samsat and T 55 m. E. of Mar'ash.

It is hot and unhealthy, but higher up the valley are residences used in summer and extensive vineyards. To the N. are high mountains, to the E. and S. are low undulating hills among which the line of the Euphrates is said to be visible. Water is obtainable from springs. Supplies are scarce. The population is mixed, but chiefly Turkish. There was an Armenian element, but deportations were reported in 1915. The town is the head-quarters of a Kaimmakam under Kharput. BELED SINJAR.

It contains a khan, Turkish barracks, and government buildings, all of which lie at the top of the slope. The houses are solidly built in the style seen also at Mosul. The town formerly covered a much larger area, including the W. slope of the valley, where now there is a ruin-field. Remains of the ancient walls are to be seen. Supplies and Commerce. —The land to N. and S. of the town is cultivated, and probably a fair amount of supplies would be available(M) BEHISNI—BELED SINJAE—BIEIJIK 427 in normal years.

General Description. —Birijik is built on the slopes of a ravine in a whitish limestone cliff which rises to about 400 ft. above the I'iver. From the top of this cliff a commanding view of the river-valley can be obtained. Outside the town to the S. is a level open space where caravans encamp and, in normal times, there are large open tents for the shelter of men and goods. For the river at Birijik see Route IV I. In peace time about 13 boats, each capable of carrying about 8 loaded pack-animals, were used on the ferry. The town is surrounded by an ancient wall, now almost in ruins, and above it on the cliff is a ruined castle. The houses are of stone, flat-roofed and two-storied. The ascent from the ferry winds through paved streets 12 ft. wide. Some terraces and gardens428 GAZETTEEE OF TOWNS appear to be situated in or on the outskirts of the town. There is one good stone khan and several others in eaves in the rock. Supplies and Commerce. —The Euphrates valley for about 80 m. southwards from Birijik is fertile, and produces wheat and barley without irrigation. In 1903 it was reported that 500 boats laden with grain went down from Birijik to Deir ez-Zor every year. The place was also the principal trade centre of this part of the country for butter, olive-oil, and grapes. Numbers of sheep are to be found in the surrounding country. A plentiful supply of water from a spring on the top of the hill above the castle runs through the town in several streams. Wood fuel from up the river is plentiful: a few poor trees grow on the heights overlooking the town. To the S. is a good district for collecting camels. For commerce passing into Mesopotamia from Northern Syria the importance of Birijik has been two-fold. First, it has long been the principal point of passage on this part of the Euphrates, being used by caravans from Aleppo or Alexandretta bound for Diarbekr or Mosul. In the years immediately preceding the war, however, the more southerly crossings at Jerablus and Tel Ahmar appear to have been coming more into use as the country became less insecure in that direction: and the construction of the Aleppo—Kas el-Ain railway which crosses the Euphrates at Jerablus must seriously affect Birijik. Secondly, Birijik is the starting-point of the down stream traffic on the Middle Euphrates by shakJitur. This class of boat was before the war built only at Birijik : see Eoute lY I. Inhabitants. —The population is said to be mixed, Turk, Arab, and Kurd, with some Armenians and Jews.

It is reported that on the Mush—Hazro route, the Kulp valley, a carriage-road is under construction. See p. 322. Until this route is reached the Bitlis pass cannot be turned from the W. by a force with guns.II 430 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS General Description. —The town lies in the deep valley of the Bitlis Su, which flows through it from S, to N. The town extends up the hill-sides and also up the side valley of the Khosrov from NW., farther up which is the suburb of Khoms containing an Armenian monastery. At the S. end of the town a side-valley opens from the E., up which are scattered houses and gardens forming the Avekh suburb. To E. of the city is a bare, steep, and rocky hill of about 1,000 ft. In the middle of the town, on the r. bank of the Bitlis, is a ruined castle on a rock of no great height. Along the W. side of the castle rock flows the Khosrov stream, which joins the Bitlis Su somewhat farther to the S. To N. of the castle rock, in the angle between the Bitlis and the Khosrov valleys, is a flat- topped spur, the Gok Maidan, on which are situated the Government buildings and a block of infantry barracks. The principal mosque lies S. of the castle rock. The houses are well and solidly built, mostly of soft volcanic tufa quarried in the neighbourhood. Good houses are to be found, especially in the Christian quarter, in the southern part of the town, where are the former British Consulate and the American Mission. The bazaars along the river-side are very much crowded with narrow winding alleys. Some of these have been cleared to make room for the Bitlis—Ziyaret chaussee which runs through the length of the town {Boute 85). There are half-a-dozen masonry bridges over the Bitlis Su, one of which, at the S. end of the town, carries the Bitlis—Ziyaret chaussee. Besides the chaussee there is a way through the town from S. to N. which ascends through the Christian quarter, and keeps high up above the 1. bank of the river. It is not passable for wheels. Trans verse streets are generally narrow and stairlike. Camping-room for troops is limited. The best place would be f m. above the town along the chaussee near a spring. Climate and Hygiene. —The position of Bitlis, facing S. in a deep valley, makes it rather hot in summer. In winter, on the other hand, snow may accumulate to a great depth. Nevertheless the seasons are not excessively severe, the mean temperature ranging from 90° to 50° E. The climate is on the whole healthy. Rheumatism is said to be common. There are chalybeate and sulphur springs in the neighbourhood. Supplies and Commerce. —Grain from the well-watered plains to the N. (e.g. that of Mush) vised to be stored at Bitlis for export. Fruit and vegetables are to be obtained from the gardens and orchards near the town. Water is very abundant, the best being brought in earthenware pipes from a stream up the Avekh valley.1 fm BITLIS—DIAEBEKR 431 Small springs are numerous. Fuel is brought in from Modikan, Khizan, and the Nimrud Dagh, but the hill-slopes in the immediate vicinity are bare of this, except in the gardens and orchards. In normal times the bazaars contained the ordinary necessaries of the neighbouring Kurdish tribes (including arms). Manchester cottons and a few other European imports (e.g. hardware) were to be obtained. Eough iron work and such leather work as was needed by caravans could be bought in the bazaars. Coarse red cloth is manufactured in the town. The main exports, besides grain, were fleeces, wools, hides, skins, furs, gall-nuts, and gum tragacanth. In the Sassun district W. of the town are iron mines worked in primitive fashion. Inhabitants. —About one-third of the inhabitants before the war were Armenians, but massacres and deportations were reported in June, 1915 ; and there was a small Jacobite community (perhaps 300 in all). The rest are Mohammedan Kurds, who had the reputa tion of being rather fanatical: the Kurdish Sheikh of Bitlis is generally an influential personage. The Armenians mainly belonged to the national (Gregorian) Church, but there were a few Armenian Catholics, and a fairly small Armenian Protestant community existed, the centre of which was the Armenian Mission School. This, how ever, also gave instruction to Gregorian Armenians. The Armenians of Bitlis were suspected by the Turks of revolutionary intrigues : Armenian insurgent bands were frequently out in the Sassun district. Administration. —Bitlis was the capital of the vilayet of the same name, which included the sanjaqs of Bitlis, Mush, Ginj, and Sairt. The garrison of the town usually consisted of two infantry battalions and a mountain battery. I DIARBEKR. On the r. bank of the Tigris, T 50 m. NNW. of Mardln. Pop. 40,000 (?). P.O., T.

General Description. —Diarbekr lies in an undulating plain at the northern head of the natural passage which leads between the Qarajeh Dagh and the Tur 'Abdin to the Mesopotamian plains. The town is situated on a line of steep basalt bluffs which here form the W. side of the Tigris valley. This valley is about 1 m. broad: opposite the E. side of the town it runs N.-S., but for a short distance above the NE. corner of the walls it runs SE., and for a short distance below the city it runs about W. Diarbekr thus stands within an easterly bend of the river. On the farther (E.) side of the valley the gentle cultivated slopes rise to ground which commands the plain near Diarbekr from a height of 150-200 ft. The river, which is about ^ m. from the eastern wall, generally becomes fordable at points near Diarbekr early in July, and it has been found in August to consist here merely of pools connected by small trickles of water: on the other hand, one authority found it 80 yds. broad in November, except at the SE. corner of the city, where it divided into two streams, which together were about 250 yds. wide. In the flood season the river becomes unfordable and spreads out to a width of as much as 500 yds. For the stone bridge below the town see III Gr, m. 4. Ferries1 For DIARBEKE 483 are also used in the flood season. The river bank is thickly planted with gardens and orchards which stretch up towards the town. On the other (W.) side of the city there rise from the plain two rounded hills with easy slopes. Their altitude is about the same as that of the high ground on the E. side of the river. They are about 5 m. from the town. The city itself is surrounded by a great wall of Eoman origin, enclosing a rectangular space of about m. square. This wall is of good rubble masonry faced with large blocks of stone (black basalt which is said to have weathered to a dull yellow tone). There are four gates, the Yeni Qapu on the E., the Mardln on the S., the Earn on the W., and the Kharput on the N. The wall on the E. side stands on the edge of a basalt cliff about 30 ft. high, and is for the most part in a ruinous condition, having been partly demolished for purposes of building: the Yeni Qapu is protected by a projecting town and wall. On the S. the walls are about 40 ft. high, very solidly constructed, with bastions, generally square, at 20 ft. intervals, and a ditch 10-20 ft. high and 5-15 ft. deep. Beyond the ditch are some irregular basalt cliffs, and a steep slope to the river, where are irrigated plantations and gardens. The Mardln gateway is 12 ft. wide, and has two sets of gates, 40 ft. apart, the outer of iron and the inner of 1^ in. planks. E. of the gate is a long projecting bastion reported in 1903 to contain cavalry stables. The walls of this bastion, 40 ft. high and 7 ft. thick, are built round a projecting rock, and a cliff 15-20 ft. high falls away below it. There is a flanking tower W. of the gate. On the W. side the walls are about 50 ft. high, with towers (at the bastions?) rising to about 65 ft. The main wall is 10-15 ft. thick, and has a roadway along the top. The musketry parapet is 2| ft. thick, 4 ft. high, with loopholes and a 4-ft. banquette. The bastions in this part are semicircular and more massive than on the other side of the Mardln Gate, having a diameter of about 50 ft.; but some are in a more or less ruinous condition. Outside the wide berm is a basalt cliff of varying but generally considerable height. From the Mardln to the Eum Gate there is a 20-ft. covered way with a partial outer wall. On the N. the wall is about 30 ft. high, much stone having been removed for building. The bastions are round. From the Kharput Gate to the river runs a broad ditch or depression containing pools of stagnant water. About 1 m. outside the gate is a block of two- storied barracks. One authority states that besides the Kharput Gate there is a wicket-gate on this side. At the NE. corner of the town is the old citadel, cut off from the MES. IV EG434 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS rest of the town by an interior wall. In it are now the Government offices and a small block of barracks which used Jto contain two companies. The garrison magazine is a domed building in the Serai. Close to it are two windows in the outer wall, quite close to the ground. The town contains about 4,000 houses, which are low, and built partly of stone, partly of mud. They are densely crowded at some points, but on the other hand there are unoccupied spaces inside the walls. There are numerous mosques, the chief of which is the Ulu Jarni', and about 190 khans. The streets are 10-15 ft. wide, badly paved, and dirty. Two main thoroughfares intersect the town at right angles, running from the N. to the S., and from the E. to the W. gates. The bazaars are good and wide. Climate and Hygiene.—The climate in summer is very hot and unhealthy : the winters are frequently severe, but not for Jong. Epidemics of typhus are frequent, ophthalmia is common, and cholera sometimes appears. The Diarbekr boil' is similar to the Basra 'date-mark', the Aleppo 'button', &amp;c. Scorpions are very common and virulent. For water-supply see below. Supplies and Commerce. —The neighbourhood of Diarbekr is very fertile, though under-cultivated, and the bazaar is well supplied with grain and fruit. Wheat, barley, rice, sesame, and lentils are grown. Much wheat is stored in Diarbekr in good seasons. Sheep and goats are numerous. _ . There are five sources for the supply of drinking-water: (i) The Qal'ah Suyu, very good and abundant water brought from a source outside the town (to N. ?); (ii) Baliqli spring with good and abundant water outside the town near the Eum Gate ; the G6l Jami', good and abundant water from a source outside the town ; (iv) the Ulu Jami Suyu, good and abundant water brought by an aqueduct from 'Ali Punar, about 1^ m. W. of Diarbekr; (v) The Hamervat, abundant water brought by an aqueduct from a spring several miles off above Sirab Gozlu village, entering Diarbekr near the NW. corner of the walls. The water near its source is excellent, but it becomes rather tainted before reaching the town as the aqueduct is uncovered at various points. The channel of the aqueduct is 4 ft. wide, and the supply could alone, if necessary, suffice for the whole town. There are about 130 fountains in the streets, and 300 in private houses. The wells in the houses are very numerous, but their water is impure and slightly brackish. Diarbekr is an important point of transit for trade passing from Syria or Asia Minor to Mesopotamia, N. Persia, or from Syria to Armenia. The course of the Baghdad Eailway, however, threatensDIAEBEKE 435 for the time to divert from it the former current of commerce. Most of its commercial dealings are carried on through Aleppo, but the practice of trading direct with Egypt and Europe has been increasing. The value of the principal exports in 1918 was: £ ■ Almonds, &amp;c. . . . 16,000 Butter (Egypt &amp; interior) . 60,000 Copper (U.K. chiefly). . 35,700 Cotton (interior) . . 15,000 Furs (Germany) . . 10,000 Eice ..... 15,000 £ Hides, &amp;e. . . . 39,000 Silk .... 33,000 Sheep (Egypt &amp; interior) 150,000 Timber .... 20,000 Wool and mohair . . 70,000 There is occasionally a large export of cereals. The chief imports are buffalo hides, calico, cotton-yarn, coffee, flannelette, hardware, paper, petroleum, and sugar. In 1913 the value of the imports from the United Kingdom was much greater than that of the imports from any other country, owing chiefly to the demand for Manchester goods. Cotton weaving for local consumption was at one time a consider able industry, but has declined, though there are still a large number of looms. Silk weaving was increasing before the war, and was estimated to furnish employment for 300 looms. Other industries are pottery, embroidery, hardware, gold and silver work, and carpet making. A few foreign insurance offices have native agents in the town, and a branch of the Ottoman Bank was opened a few years ago. Inhabitants. —The Moslem inhabitants speak Arabic, Kurdish, and Turkish. The Christians, who together before the war amounted to about one-fourth or one-third of the whole population, were Armenians, Jacobites, Chaldaeans, and Greeks. There is also a Jewish colony. The Armenians were massacred here in 1895. Administration and Authorities. —Diarbekr is the capital of a and the seat of a vali. The garrison before the war used to be one battalion of regular infantry, one regiment of and one regiment of cavalry. A corrupt and intriguing set of wealthy Moslem families had much influence in the town and the neighbourhood. The Gregorian Armenians, the Armenian Uniates, the Jacobites, Jacobite Uniates (Syrian Catholics), the Chaldaean Uniates had their bishops or archbishops. There was a French mission, and an Armenian Protestant community. There were vice-consuls of Great Britain and France. History. —Diarbekr, under its classical name Amida, was an important frontier fortress of the later Roman Empire (4th-7th e e 24B6 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS century a. d .), which long disputed it with the Persians, till the Arabs captured it in a.d . 638. Since then it has been many times besieged and captured. The Turks finally took it in the sixteenth century. Its position at the meeting of trade-routes has kept it alive, though it seems to have been for long declining until a few years before the war. DILMAN (or Salmas).

General Description. —The town, which has clean streets, stands on the 1. bank of a stream flowing to lake Urmia. The Salmas plain is a large level area, the soil of which is too salt near the lake to be of use for anything but pasture, whereas to the W. it is highly cultivated, this part of the plain being said to contain no fewer than 66 villages. Dilman itself is surrounded by gardens. There is an old town, almost in ruins, about 4 m. W. of the present town, the site having been changed for the sake of greater security irom the Kurds. The townsfolk are Persians. Dilman and the Salmas dis trict received many Armenian and Nestorian refugees, and were the scene of much suffering in 1914-15 ; many villages in the district were destroyed (see under Urmia).. Supplies and Commerce. —The plain, as has been stated, is partly rich land, but the bazaars of the town are poor and ill supplied. Caravans ply from Dilman to Van, Julamerk, Tiflis, and Erzeium. Administration. —Dilman was the seat of a Persian governor, under the governor of Urmia. A Turkish consul resided here, and a Russian post was established in 1912. FABQIN' (or Silwan). About 45 m.

For the route from Bismil to Mardin see under Route 95 b. General Description. —The town is situated under a steep, rocky ridge which commands it from the N., while to the S. and SW. the country is undulating and open. The present town occupies only the SW. part of the area enclosed by the old walls, the rest of the space being occupied by ruins. These walls form a square about I m. on each side, with towers at intervals. They are now in a dilapidated condition, as much stone has been taken from them fox- building. A remarkable square tower, 100 ft. high, stands in the plain | m. outside the SE. corner of the walls. There is a good camping-ground along the Diarbekr—Bitlis chaussee 103 a) which passes round to the S. of the town and does not enter it. Supplies and Commerce.' —The country S, and SW. of Farqln is naturally fertile, but much under-cultivated. There is no informa tion as to supplies. Water is obtained from three large springs in the ridge to the N., the streams from which are led to the town through the,walled area.

General Description. —The town is built on the low, gravelly 'island' in the Tigris from which it derives its name. It is not, however, effectively surrounded by water except in the flood season, for at other times the longer channel, which bounds the town on N., W., and S., is practically dry, though it contains some springs. This western channel, which is said to be 150 yds. wide, has a small bridge, consisting of four spans of wood on masonry piers with a plank roadway 10 ft. wide. Before the war the eastern channel— the main arm of the Tigris—was crossed, except in the floods, by a boat-bridge 120 yds. long. This bridge consisted of 16 pontoons and had a planked roadway 16 ft. wide. It was disconnected during the floods, when the inundation spreads out to a total width of 400 yds. A ferry was then used. A depth of 15 ft. has been found in the river during June. There is an ancient stone pier on the E. bank of the island, and two miles down-stream are the remains of an old bridge called the Pir-i-Bahfit. (See III Gr, m. 171|.) The island enclosed between the two channels is 700 yds. long and 500 yds. broad. The town is close-built, with narrow, dirty streets. It is surrounded by a masonry wall 15-20 ft. high, dating from the period of the Eoman occupation, when the place was an important frontier fortress. Overlooking the river are the Turkish Government offices, built on part of the old wall. The Christian quarter is on the E. side of the island. Climate and Hygiene. —The site of the town is much shut in, bare hills rising on either side of the river. The climate is therefore intensely hot in summer; the place is unhealthy, and there is liability to fever. For the water-supply see below. Supplies and Commerce. —Supplies for travellers and caravans were plentiful in normal times, though in the years preceding the war the neighbourhood had suffered much from Kurdish depredations. Good fruit is to be obtained in autumn from gardens down-stream. Kurdish tribes (the principal of which seems to be the Miran) pasture their flocks and herds in the country west of Jeziret-ibn-'Omar during the winter and spring. About June they assemble near the town and cross the river here on their way to the summer pastures in the mountains. In September they return. The water from the small wells in the town is much polluted: that from the river is good when filtered.JEZIRET-IBN'OMAR—KHOI K 439 Commercially, Jezlret-ibn-'Omar has been mainly important as a point of transit for caravans travelling between Mosul and Diarbekr, and as a distributive centre for goods brought down from the N. by river. Its market is much frequented by the Kurds of the neighbour ing hills. At Kharpot, E. of Jezlret-ibn-'Omar, are coal and bitumen deposits. Inhabitants. —The population is mainly Kurdish, but before the war there were a number of Christians—chiefly Chaldaeans and Jacobites or Jacobite Uniates—who were estimated at 100 households. The French Dominican Mission at Mosul had a dispensary here before the war and maintained schools in the neighbouring villages. The Miran Kurds, who dwell in the neighbourhood in winter and spring, migrating towards Van in the summer, have a bad reputation. They are said to number about 1,000 families. Administration. —Jezlret-ibn-'Omar is the head-quarters of a Its Kaimmakam is under Diarbekr. History. —The site of Jezlret-ibn-'Omar, the ancient Bezabde, has for many centuries been inhabited, its antiquity being probably due to the convenience of the river-crossing. Alexander crossed here when he was marching against the Persian army which was concen trating near the Great Zab before the battle of Arbela (Erbil). Later the Romans held it for some time. In recent history the town for long was held by Kurdish chiefs, who took toll of the nomads as they passed from the plains W. of the Tigris to the mountains and back again. KHOI.

It is fertile, and contains many large villages. The town itself is walled, but outside the walls there are extensive suburbs to the W. and smaller ones to S. and E. The town walls form a quadrilateral measuring 1,100-1,200 yds. in the side; they have small circular towers or bastions at intervals of about 80 yds. The mud curtain wall is 24 ft. high. The interior wall is vertical from the ground-level to within 8 ft. of the top of the parapet, where there is a way 6 ft. wide, in part paved with burnt bricks. The parapet is loopholed, and its exterior slopes very steeply to the main ditch, which is 50 ft. broad. Beyond this ditch is a broad and massive outer line of defence, with another ditch 40 ft. broad and 15 ft. deep. The defences are in a moderate state of repair. The town is entered by five gates, one each on the N., S., and E., and two on the W., approached by wooden bridges over the ditches. The town is well laid out, with broad, regular streets, sometimes shaded by willows, and watered by channels from the Qotur Chai. There is a large walled enclosure called the Ark, containing the arsenal, official residences, &amp;c. The arsenal store-buildings are well suited for their purpose. There are some good buildings elsewhere in the town, including several mosques, a large brick bazaar, and a fine caravanserai. The Qotur Chai is crossed by a bridge of seven arches. Supplies and Commerce. —The town is an important agricultural centre, the locality producing, under irrigation, large quantities of wheat, barley, and other grains, fodder, cotton, rice, fruits, and vegetables. Wood is scarce, but all other supplies are plentiful. There is a large transit trade, and considerable local traffic across the Turkish frontier. Inhabitants. —The population is largely Turkish, but there was an Armenian quarter of some 500 houses outside the town. KILLIS. About 35 m, N. of Aleppo. Pop. 12,000 (?). T. (Aleppo .Mar'ash line).

General Description. —Killis is a town of flat-roofed stone houses lying in a plain under the eastern slopes of Kurt Dagh. There is a good stone khan in the market-place, and there are apparently several others in different parts of the town. In general, the houses are said to be not well built. The bazaars are large. Supplies. —Killis would make a good supply-centre for troops, as the neighbouring plain is very fertile and is easy to traverse in all directions except after rain. Wheat, barley, millet, sesame, cottons, fruit, and olives are grown. There is good water from wells, and a gravity supply from a hill behind the town. Vine branches are most in use for fuel, and each house keeps a small stack. In normal times a number of four-horsed covered carts (estimated at 30 in 1904) could be obtained here. Donkeys are of a'good quality and numerous. Inhabitants.—The bulk of the population is Turkish. There was a large Armenian quarter to the NE. (but deportations were reported in late summer, 1915), and a few Arabs and Circassians live in a quarter on the NW. There is also apparently a certain Kurdish element. Administration. —Killis is the head-quarters of a Kasa. Its Kaim- makam is under Aleppo. LIJJEE. About 45 m. NE. of Diarbekr. About 1,000 houses. Routes.— (i) To Diarbekr. (See Route 104.)

To the S. is a level, cultivated valley some m. wide down which inns the road to Diarbekr. To the N. the slopes of the Kum Dagh above the town are steep and rocky, thinly covered with brushwood. Watei is very plentiful. There is no information as to other supplies. The inhabitants are mainly Kurdish, but there was a considerable Armenian community.

General Description. —-The town lies at the foot of the Akhlr Dagh, and is intersected by the deep ravines of many watercourses, with the result that there is scarcely a level street. Towards the W. side of the town rises a large hill, with a ruined citadel. The barracks are modern, and lie towards the N. on the road leading to Zeitun. Most of the houses are surrounded by large courtyards and gardens. The climate in summer is said to be rather unhealthy owing to the neighbourhood of the marshy rice-growing plain to the S., but the high-lying ground near the town is very healthy. Supplies and Commerce. —The plain is well cultivated, producing corn and rice, while near the town are vineyards and fruit-gardens. The town would be a good centre for collecting supplies. There is excellent water from springs in the Akhlr Dagh, the most famous being the Qirq Goz spring, while the Aq Su crosses the plain a few miles to the S. There is also good grazing on the hills. Inhabitants. —The town was inhabited before the war chiefly by Turks and Armenians, the latter of whom were said to form a third of the total population. Some of the poorer class were Ansarieh. The town was a missionary centre, and there was a considerable Protestant Armenian community. A massacre and deportation of Armenians was reported in the summer of 1915. There were Pro testant and Jewish schools. Administration and Authorities. —Mar'ash is a seat of a Mutessarif in the Vilayet of Aleppo, the Sanjaq including the Kazas of Bazarjik, Anderin, and Albistan.

The summit of the hill above the town rises in an abrupt crest of precipitous rock ? the top of which is a level table-land 7 the site of a citadel now ruinous. Below the southern side of the citadel rock the town extends along the side of the hill 7 some two miles in length, and | m. in width, and is surrounded by a ruined wall. The houses, which are of stone and fairly solidly built, rise in terraces, one row above the other. The lowest are estimated to be at least 1,500 ft. above the plain. The streets, which are narrow and tortuous for the most part, run longitudinally. Those wmch ascend the slopes are very steep, generally paved in steps, with a gradient of 1 in 6* It was reported in October, 1916, that some of the streets were being widened to allow the passage of motor loiries, and road-building was in progress in the vicinity of the town. Climate, —The climate is healthy and dry: the cold in winter is not great, and little snow falls. Supplies and Commerce.— There is no definite information as to supplies, but the country in the neighbourhood is fertile, producing good crops of wheat, barley, sesame, vegetables, and also some nee. There are good orchards, and the hill slopes outside the town aie covered with vineyards. Springs at various levels on the hill pio- vide a good, but not abundant, water-supply: they occasionally inn short. The well-water is rather brackish. Every house has its444 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS cistern. Local industries are not important, the most considerable being cotton- and wool-weaving. Inhabitants. —The Moslems seem to be of mixed Kurdish and Arabic blood ; the Christians, who formed before the war about half the population (or perhaps more), were Armenians, Jacobites, Chal- daeans, and Protestants. Mardln is the head-quarters of the Jacobite sect, whose Patriarch (called the Patriarch of Antioch) resides at Deir Zafran, a monastery in the valley to the E. of the town. During the war there appears to have been a general deportation of Catholics, Chaldaeans, and Protestants. There were Franciscan and Capuchin monasteries here, and an important American Protestant mission with schools for boys and girls. Kurdish, Syriac, Arabic, and to a slight extent Turkish are spoken in the town. Administration. —Mardln is the head-quarters of a Scmjaq under Diarbekr. Its garrison before the war usually consisted of a battalion of regular infantry. History. —Mardln is the ancient Marde, an important Eoman frontier fortress. Its citadel long remained famous, and about a . n. 1400 successfully resisted Timur Lang. It was for some time ruled by an independent Turkoman dynasty. MIDIAT. About 175 m. NW. of Mosul and 78 m.

General Description. —The town is small, and stands m the plain, though not far N. of it begin undulations which run up to the foot of the neighbouring Tur 'Abdin plateau. On its S. side flows the Jaghjagha in three arms, crossed by an old stone bridge ot 1^ (or 9?) arches, which before the war was in good repair, but was apparently not passable for wheeled traffic. W. of the town is a very ancient Jacobite church, and in this direction and to the bW. are numerous mounds and a few pillars, marking the site ot e ancient city, which was an important frontier fortress of the Koman Empire. The modern town consists principally of flat-rooted mud houses, though some of the buildings are of stone. The main stree which runs through the place is fairly broad. _ .. . , , . ,, The Baghdad Railway is planned to pass by Nisibm, but in the summer of 1916 the section Ras el-Ain Nisibin had no een completed, and preference has now been given to a line Ras el- Am Mardln (for Diarbekr).

Supplies, —The plain in the neighbourhood of Nisibm -is well watered by the Jaghjagha and its tributaries, and is naturally very fertile. Agriculture, though checked by insecurity, &amp;c., had appa rently been developing in the years before the war, and even in o it was estimated that ' supplies to support a division for some time could be collected' if the people were friendly. Wheat, barley, millet, and some rice are grown. Sheep, horses, and camels aie446 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS obtainable in the neighbourhood in considerable numbers. The nomads (particularly the Shammar) often camp in the plain of Nisibin, attracted by the comparatively abundant water-supply. In the town of Nisibin water is obtained from wells and from the rivers Jaghjagha and Khinis (the latter being a stream which flows near or possibly through the town to the north of the Jaghjagha). The water from these streams is not particularly pure at any time, and in summer it is polluted and made undrinkable by the rice- fields above the town. At that season only the well-water, which is not good, is available. Inhabitants. —About half the population is Kurdish, the rest being mainly Jewish and Christian, with a few Turks and perhaps some Tai Arabs. The cultivators of the neighbourhood seem to be mainly Tai Arabs to the S. and Kurds to the E. Administration. —Nisibin is the head-quarters of a Kaza. Its Kaim- makam is under Diarbekr. SAIHT.

The streets are dirty, crooked, and ill-paved. There are some old mosques, a leaning minaret of brick and stone, and a castle. Supplies. —A certain amount of wheat, barley, millet, rice, and lentils are grown in the district, but the most important cultivation is that of the vine. Probably there is no great surplus of cereals beyond the amount needed for local consumption. The water- supply is from wells and from covered tanks which are cut in the rock in the hills E. of the town. It often runs short in summer. The best wells are outside the town to the N., and are walled round and covered. Another good well is at the SE. corner of the town. There are also wells in some of the courtyards of houses, but they are often contaminated and brackish. Firewood has to be brought from Shirwan and other districts to the E., as the nearer hills have been denuded of timber. , , ^ Inhabitants. —There were about 9,500 Moslems and 4,500 Christians in the place some years before the war. The Christians were mostly Armenians, but included also Chaldaeans and Jaco bites. A massacre of Christians was reported in May, 191o.

General Description. —Urfeh stands at the NW. corner of a northern extension of the Harran plain, which has low hills on three sides of it. This extension of the plain is enclosed by the Nimrud Dagh on the W., by the outliers of the Qarajeh Dagh on the N., and by the Tektek Dagh on the E. The town is built on two rocky hills, a southern and a northern, the ravine between which, contain ing a small stream, runs in an easterly direction. The eastern part of the town lies on level ground. The southern hill is crowned by a ruinous citadel, some 400 yds. long and 60 yds. broad. A wall, with turrets and a ditch cut in the rock, 30 ft. wide and 40 ft. deep, sur rounds most of the city, but it would be of little use against artillery. Outside the wall, to the N., is a new quarter. In the principal square, apparently between the hills, is the Mosque of Abraham, near which are two large stone tanks containing sacred fish. TheTEL ATAR—UEFEH 449 streets of the town, which are narrow and straggling, run generally E. and W., or N. and S. The houses are built of stone, and there are some good khans. Supplies and Commerce. —There is much wheat grown in the well-cultivated plain S. and SE. of Urfeh, and extensive pastures are also to be found there. The town and its district would form important bases of supply. The town has a plentiful water-supply; several strong springs rise on the northern side of the citadel hill, and feed the two tanks mentioned above. Another spring called Qara Punar lies further to the E. Springs also exist in the hilly ground N. of the town, and water is brought thence in hares. Lastly, there are numerous small springs in the plain near Urfeh to the S. Fuel is very scarce. Wood in normal times had to be brought on camels from the Tur Abdin country. is most in use: twigs, vine branches, and olive stumps are also employed. Kerosine was imported in considerable quantities before the war. Charcoal was very expensive. Urfeh has been a most important point of transit for commerce going from the Euphrates to Mosul or to Armenia by Diarbekr. The railway, however, now passes some 40-45 miles to the S. of it, and the branch line to Uffeh which is contemplated has apparently not been taken in hand. Inhabitants, —The bulk of the population before the war seems to have been Moslem (Turkish and Kurdish). There was a large Armenian community, estimated at 7,500, and settlements of Jacobites, Jacobite Uniates, and Jews. Massacres of the Armenians, deportation, and some resistance to the deportation order, are re ported to have taken place in August-October 1915. An American mission was the centre of a considerable Protestant community. Administration. —Urfeh is the head-quarters of a Scinjaq in the Aleppo Vilayet, and is therefore administered by a Mutessarif. A small regular garrison was maintained here before the war. History, —Urfeh is the ancient Edessa, and in the first centuries b . o. and a. d . was the capital of a small state which was a buffer between the Koman and Parthian Empires. The Roman Government annexed it in the second century a.d . and for some time it flourished as a commercial centre, as a in the Roman frontier defences, and as a university town. In the Middle Ages it was captured by the Crusaders, and for the first half of the twelfth century was ruled by Christian counts. At present it derives some importance from its position on the ordinary Aleppo—Diarbekr trade route and from its connexion with Abraham in Moslem legends. In 1896 there was a massacre of Armenians here. MES. IV450 GAZETTEEE OF TOWNS URMIA (Urumiyeh,). In Persia (Azarbaijan), 12 m. W. of the middle part of the W. shore of Lake Urmia. Alt. 4,400 ft.

General Description. —The town of Urmia is situated in the plain bordering the Lake of the same name on the W. This is a very fertile district, and the town is encircled by orchards and contains many gardens. A wall with seven gates, and a dry ditch which can be flooded, surround the town. The streets are unusually broad, and commonly have a stream of water in the centre. The town contains a citadel with arsenal and small barracks, some old mosques, and a busy bazaar. Lake Urmia is a sheet of water 80-90 m. long from N. to S., and 30-45 m. broad from E. to W., the dimensions varying greatly as , ■' between the seasons of h.w.—in spring when the snows are melting —and l.w. The shores are low and shelving, and the whole lake is very shallow, probably not exceeding 50 ft. in greatest depth. There are a large number of small islands. The water is excessively saline. Navigation is carried on by a few boats with round bows and flat sterns, of about 20 tons burden, carrying a very large square sail. Before the war insufficient use had been made of the possibilities of water-borne trade, though in 1912 a Eussian company obtained a concession for navigation. ' life, Supplies and Commerce. —The district is extraordinarily fertile; fruit, vines, rice, tobacco, cotton, melons, and many other products are raised, but the people before the war were much oppressed by extortionate officials. The mountains to the W. are said to contain zinc, lead, and silver, and also petroleum springs which are kept burning by the natives to prevent the pollution of the streams. There was a considerable export of dried fruits, and tobacco highly esteemed for smoking in chibuJcs (Turkish pipes). _ Inhabitants and History. —The population consisted before the war mainly of Afshar Turks, with a number of Nestorian, Jewish, and Armenian families. Urmia has been since 1835 the head-quarters of various missions to the Nestorian Christians, including American (Presbyterian), British (Anglican), French (Lazarist), and Kussian (Orthodox) missions. In 1906-1910 the Turks gradually occupied Eastern Azarbaijan from Khoi to Suj Bulaq, and as far E. as Lake Urmia, partly in order to improve their strategical position on theirUEMIA—USHNU 451 Kussian frontier. Their occupation was accompanied by Kurdish raids. In 1911, Anglo-Eussian pressure obliged them to withdraw, and a Eussian force occupied the district to maintain order. The town and district and the Christian population suffered much during the war, and many villages were destroyed. In October 1914 there was an attack on Urmia by Kurds instigated by the Turks. In November the Eussians expelled the Kurds and other Sunnisfrom villages in the neighbourhood, and their places were taken by Christians expelled from their homes by the Turks. The Eussians evacuated Urmia in January 1915, and the Turks and Kurds massacred or expelled the Christians of the neighbourhood. The Christian population of the Urmia and Salmas districts was estimated before the war at 16,000-17,000 Armenians and 30,000 Syrians (Nestorian, Orthodox, or Chaldaean), but these were largely reduced by massacre and disease, while many fled northward from Urmia when the Turks were threatening it. There has been, on the other hand, an influx of Armenian refugees, and of Nestorians, especially from the Hakkiari country into Salmas ; among these the mortality has been very high. The Eussians reoccupied Urmia in May 1915. USHNU. In Persia (Azarbaijan), at the foot of the hills to the SW. of Lake Urmia. Alt. 4,619 ft. Pop. about 200 families. Routes. — (i) To Urmia.

General Description. —The town of Van lies in a fertile plain which slopes gently up from the Lake on the W. to the foot of the Varak Dagh on the E., a distance of about 8 m. The highest summit of the Varak Dagh is about 4,500 ft. above the plain. From N. to S. the plain is about 5 m. broad, and on these sides it is bounded by hills of no great height, over which several easy passes lead. From this plain rise two isolated rocky masses, the citadel hill of Van, and, some 2-3 m. to ENE., the Zemzem Dagh with its flat-topped spur the Toprak Qal'ah, which overlooks the northernmost suburb of the city. The remarkable citadel rock of Van, which rises abruptly out ot the plain, is some 1,100 yds. from the lake shore. Close under its southern side lies the walled town, and E. and S. of this, again, aie the extensive garden quarters which stretch eastwards for about 3* m., and southwards for about 1 m. The following description of the town refers to its condition before the war; the garden quarters were much damaged during fighting between the Armenians and Turks in April-May 1915. Various important buildings, such as the Turkish barracks and the British Consulate, appear to have been wholly or partly destroyed, and theVAN 453 suburb of Artamid to have been ruined. The walled city was bombarded from the citadel rock, but no great damage was done except to the upper stories of houses. The garden quarters, thickly planted with poplars and luxuriant undergrowth, are surrounded and intersected by mud walls 10-12 ft. high. The houses lie in clusters, which are hidden from the roads approaching the town by the trees; these groups of buildings are most numerous and important in the neighbourhood of the main avenues. The houses are generally well built with flat roofs and often of two stories. The principal avenue is that which runs eastwards from the walled town to Sikheh at the further end of the gardens. Another avenue leads from the walled town SE. to the Erekh garden-quarter. Both these roads are metalled. A fairly broad unmetalled road connects the Aq Kopril quarter, which lies to N. under the Toprak Qal'ah, with Erekh on the S. Elsewhere are lanes, passable for carts in parts, but in places either cut up by canals or too narrow for wheels. The canals, however, though numerous, are not serious obstacles. The vegetation of the gardens is wholly dependent on irrigation, which is carried out by means of water-cuts, or of These latter are apparently often to be found under the bed of water courses which are dry on the surface, the position of the being indicated by holes at intervals. The main sources of the water supply for irrigation seem to be the following: (i) The Aq Koprii Su, which flows from the X. end of the Varak Dagh to the lake, passing between the Aq Koprtl quarter on the N. and the other garden quarters on the S.; it is bridged opposite the Aq Kopril quarter, and continues through the plain N. of the citadel, (ii) The Quru Bash Chai, which flows from the S. end of the Varak Dagh past the S. side of Erekh and then bends along the N. side of the Shemiram Alti quarter, which lies S. of the walled city, (iii) The Shemiram Su, or Shemiram canal, which brings water from the Khoshab 19 m. away, passing by Artamid : it irrigates the Shemiram Alti quarter. The walled city of Van was formerly encircled by a double line of fortifications with a ditch and covered way. But by 1904 traces of the outer wall could be found only on the E. face, the principal feature remaining being the Tabriz Gate. On the E. and S. faces the inner wall was about 18 ft. high, 15 ft. thick, and with a banquette 10-15 ft. wide. There were semi-circular bastions at intervals, all in bad repair. Only on the E. side was the ditch a serious obstacle. • On the SW. side the walls have been wholly destroyed, while on the NW. face they had been partly demolished454 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS by 1904, the stones being removed for building purposes. The Tabriz Gate lies close under the SE. corner of the citadel rock. In the S. gate are the Serai, and (about 200 yds, further W.) the Arta Gate. At the N. end of the W. wall under the citadel rock is the Iskeleh Gate. The streets of the walled town are narrow and winding; the houses here are the Government buildings, the barracks, and the principal shops and bazaars. The citadel rock, 1,300 yds. long and 360 ft. above the plain, runs along the whole of the N. side of the walled town. The S. face of the rock overlooking the city is quite precipitous. The N. side of the hill slopes down at an angle of 45°, and is easy to climb at most points; where the rock appears on this side it is cut into steps. The ground below this slope is marshy, and a swamp fed by several small springs has filled up the old wet ditch along the N. side of the hill. There is said to be a steep stairway cut into the face of the rock on its S. side leading from the walled town up to the central citadel, but this is no longer in use. The ascents to the citadel appear to lie at the W. and E. ends of the rock. The central citadel occupies the highest part of the summit about halfway between the E. and W. ends of the rock, or slightly nearer to the W. extremity. The plateau on which it stands is about 180 yds. long by 120 yds. broad. E. and W. of this central citadel is a line of masonry walls some 25 ft. high with circular bastions at intervals. In this wall are gateways at the SE. corner, on the NW. face, and at the extreme western corner; the gates themselves have disappeared. The wall round the SE. gate is half in ruins. At the W. end of the rock is a large spring overlooked by a bastion of large stone blocks, which is now in ruins, as also is the wall which protected the spring. • The central citadel is isolated from the outer walls and is entered by a gate at its NE. corner. Its walls are partly of masonry, partly of mud, built upon ancient foundations of large stones. Apparently within the central citadel is a naphtha well. In the centre of the northern face of the hill is a flanking bastion designed to bring fire along the base of the northern slope ; but this bastion, and the walls connecting it with the central citadel, are now in ruins. A subterranean passage is said to lead from it to the central citadel, but is probably choked up. A mosque with a minaret is a prominent object in the centre of the citadel. A masonry magazine shows up prominently at the K. end, and other magazines are situated in rock-cut chambers a short■^o VAN 455 way below. Barracks which before the war usually contained 200 men are also situated in the citadel. Climate. —The climate is said to be very cold in winter and hot in summer. The town is malarious and unhealthy in autumn. Slight earthquakes are frequent, and serious shocks sometimes occur. Supplies, —The plain of Van is well cultivated with corn, vege tables, and fruits. _ _ . _ ^ There is no further information as to supplies. Besides the bazaars in the walled town there are others in the more important garden quarters. The largest of these is at Erekh. The principal exports from the Vilayet of Van are dye-stuffs, furs, sheep and goats and their products, silver work, tobacco, and walnut logs, but the unsettled state of the country and indifferent communications were against commercial development even before the war, and trade was small. For drinking-water the walled town is supplied from 4 copious springs, besides the one already mentioned at the W. end of the rock; but the water from these is not very good. In the gardens the principal supply is from the harez (see above), being obtained from their mouths or from the holes at intervals of their course. The best are at the E. end of the gardens, where water can be obtained without contamination from houses. Elsewhere all the lid)'('z' are more or less contaminated. The Shemiram canal-water contains sulphate and carbonate of lime, but it is drunk by the poorer people. The water in the Qurubash Chai above Qurubash village is good ; so also is that in the Quru Chai above the gardens. In the border hills are numerous springs. The water of the lake, which is impregnated with carbonate and sulphate of soda, is undrinkable. 1 .. , Petroleum is reported near Korzot, but has not yet been exploited. Inhabitants.—In 1899 it was estimated that about two-thirds of the population were Christians (Armenians) and one-third^ Moslem. In 1914 the Moslems were estimated at 10,000, the Christians at 25,000. The Moslems are principally Kurds, but there are a few influential Turkish families. The Armenian population left the town when it was evacuated by the Russians early in August Many Armenian villages in the neighbourhood w r ere sacked by the Turks, and the inhabitants fled or were massacred. ^ The Government officials and the merchants lived m the garden quarter, and went every day to their offices or shops in the walled ci y. Before the war there was a very flourishing American Mission *and Orphan School for Armenians at the E. end of the gardens. There was also a French Dominican Mission with schools for Armenians.456 GAZETTEEK OP TOWNS Administration. —Van before the war was the capital of the , of the same name, which included the of Van and Bash Qal'ah. The town was administered by the Vali with the usual nominal 'municipal council'. The Turkish garrison usually con sisted of about 5 battalions of infantry, 2 squadrons of cavalry, and 2 mountain-batteries. There were British, Russian, and French vice-consuls. i' 1 VEIBAN SHEHR. About 50 m. ENE. of Urfeh and about 45 m. W. of Mardln. Pop. 4,000-5,000 {?). Routes.— (i) To Mardin. (See Routes 116 a, b, c.) (ii) To Diarbekr. (See Routes 117 a, b, c.) (iii) To Severek. (See JRoute 119.) (iv) To Urfeh.. (See lioute 118.) (v) To E-as el-'Ain. (See Rou 128.) Veiran Shehr is a small town in a plain enclosed on N., W., and E. by low rocky hills. To the S. the country is open to Eas el-'Ain. The modern settlement is built among the ruins of an older city, from which it derives its name. During the first years of the present century the prosperity of the town and the neighbourhood increased considerably under the rule of the late Ibrahim Pasha, the leader of the Kurdish Milli tribes, who had here the centre of his power. Cultivation spread in the fertile plain near the town, and Kurdish and Christian villages sprang up here. The place was plundered by Turks and Arabs after Ibrahim Pasha's death in 1908, and many of the inhabitants were murdered. A certain quantity of supplies might be collected here, but there is no definite information on the subject. Good water is to be had from springs and wells. The inhabitants are mainly Kurds; there are also a few Circassians, and some Syrian Christians (traders). ZAKKO. About 60 m. KNW. of Mosul, and about 30 m. ESE. of JezIret -ibn-'Omar.

(The Khabur Su is navigable for rafts below Zakho in high water until the end of June.) General Description. —Zakho is built on a rocky island measuring some 800 by 400 yds. in the Khabur Su, which above the town is a mountain stream, and below it spreads out through several cbannels in a shingle bed 400 yds. broad. The island is connected with the 1. (southern) bank by a stone bridge with a 10-ft. roadway (see further, p. 234), but this is said to be sometimes covered by the river in flood, and the western part of the island is also subject to inundation. The northern arm of the river was not bridged before the war, and is unfordable until the end of June. For the stone bridge with 15-tt. roadway some 2 m. up-stream of Zakho, see 90 a, m. t At the E. end of the town, on a low cliff, is an old Kurdish castle, now used as Government offices. It is an irregularly shaped building of about 60 by 40 yds. The climate is good. , „ ., It is reported that the spurs of the Jebel Abyadh, S. ot Zakho, afford good positions for the defence of the Mosul road which crosses the range by the Zakho pass. The range appears to be impassable between this pass and its western end in the neighbourhood of Derebun. Supplies, —The soil of the Khabur valley is naturally fertile, and there is said to be good cultivation in the neighbouring valleys, where wheat, barley, rice, tobacco, and many kinds of fruit are grown. But in the years preceding the war the district had sufferec much from Kurdish depredations. There is fair grazing and abundant water in the Khabur valley, where also good open camping grounds are to be found. Coal mines, which in 1903 were unworked, are reported in the hills N. of Zakho at Marsis, at Harbol, and near Sheranis. The quality of coal is believed to be good. Inhabitants. —The population of Zakho includes Kurds, Chaldaeans, Jews, and a few Arabs. The Christians in the neighbouring villages have suffered much of late from the Kurds. Administration and Authorities. —Zakho is the head-quarters of a Kam under Mosul. Before the war the Turks maintained here a post of military police mounted on mules. The piincipa person at Zakho, who may discharge the functions of the Kaimmakam, is apparently the hereditary Kurdish Agha, belonging o e &gt;. mam tribe.TEANSLITEEATION OF ARABIC, PERSIAN, AND TURKISH NAMES A n attempt has been made in the Handbook to transliterate Arabic, Persian, and Turkish names upon a uniform system, which is explained in detail in the following paragraphs. The aim has been to assist the reader in their correct pronunciation, without overburdening the text with a large number of dia critical marks. It will be noted that a long accent is used to mark the length of a vowel above which it is placed (a, I, o, u); the only other symbols employed are for the consonant Ain, and ' for the Hamzah, or cutting off of the breath which can precede or follow a vowel. Conventional spellings have been retained when sanctioned by general usage ; a list of examples, with their correct equivalents, is given on p. 468.464 TRANSLITERATION OF ARABIC NAMES V. Compound 14. The two components in a compound name (in the absence of the imfat or J1 between them) are written with a capital and without a hyphen connecting them, e.g. 'Aljlxls, Da'ud. 15. When, however, the second member of the compound is a verbal root or is inseparably connected with the first, the whole has been treated as one word whether written in vernacular as one word or two, e. g. Imdmzddeh,Sabzahad. 16. Words which have become Europeanized are left in that form, e. g. Mecca (for MaTikah), Basra (for Medina (for al-Medmah). 17. The Arabic article J1 prefixed to names has been omitted in English, except in cases where its retention is authorized by general usage. 18. The word ilm occurring in the name of a person is written without, a hyphen before or after it, e. g. 1 hrdlmn. II PERSIAN J. Conson 19. The same as for Arabic, plus : i_) = p i = z ^ = z 5=vorw O = s j — zh = g E= ch II. V 20. The same as for Arabic.TRANSLITERATION OF PERSIAN NAMES 465 III. Diphth 21. The same as for Arabic. IV. Rem 22. ' Izafat' is transliterated by i with a hyphen before and after, e.g. KoJi-i-Siyah. 23. Final he (s) is transliterated only when pronounced, e.g. shah, deh. Ill TURKISH 24. The same as for Arabic, plus: Modified vowels 6, u. 25. A few Turkish words where two vowels come together, as in Bair, are written with a Hamza, e. g. Ba'ir. 26. In Turkish a half audible sound is introduced between It and following vowel.
