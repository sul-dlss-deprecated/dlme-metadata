Luristdn is considered by Lurs to form three main divisions: Pnsht-i-Kuh, Pish-i-Kuh, and Bala Garlweh, corresponding to the main tribal divisions: they are not really geographical entities, but it is convenient so to describe them, the boundaries, within which the tribes belonging to these divisions live, being fairly well defined. Pusht-i-Kuh is bounded on the south by the Turko-Persian frontier, and extends as far west as Mandalij and the Ab-i-Kangir ; on the north it extends to the Saidmarreh river, on the west to the Kalhur country, aod on the east to the Karkheh. Pish-i-Kuh is bounded on the south by the Saidmarreh river; on the west by the districts of Harsin, Hulailan and Kangawar’ comprised in the province of Kirmanshab ; on the east by the Kash- gan river and the lands occupied by the Bairanwand north of Khur- ramabad; and on the north by the Kuh-i-Garru, which forms the boundary between Luristan, and the districts of Kangawar, Niha- wand and Sdakhor Pain. On the Khurramabad-Kirmanshah road (route 18) the Gashur pass, 7 miles east of Harsin, is the boundary. The Bald Gariweh country comprises the rest of Luristan, and is bounded on the south by ' Arabistan, on the west by the Kashgan, on the east by the Diz and on the north by the Kuh-i-Garru, which forms the boundary between Luristan and Sllakhor Pain. The Chavlreh Shah pass is the boundary on the Khurramabad-Burujird road (route No. 8b the Kazan district being included in the terri tories directly administered from Burujird: it so happens that the boundary of the neutral zone agreed upon between Russia and Great Britain corresponds almost exactly at this important point with the boundary of Luristan. Inhabitants. Pusht-i-Kuh is occupied by Fail! Lurs, with a sprinkling of Kurd, Dirakwand ^ and Sagwand tribes who have settled here at various times and intermarried with the original tribes. All alike are under the aegis of the Wall. Details will be found in Captain Lorimer’s Report on the district. C 242 GSB2 Pish-i-Kuh has been, from time immemorial, the abode of the Silsileh and Dilfan divisions (so named, it is said, from two brothers). They are mostly Lakks, but there is a considerable number of Lurs in the Eastern part of the district, speaking a distinct dialect, though differing in no other way from their Lakk neighbours. The Bald Gariweh tribes are ah Lurs : the term includes Bair- anwand (classed as Lakks by Rabino) Sagwand, ChiginT, Dirak- Wand, PapI and JudekIthey acknowledge no single leader or lead ers and are perpetually at feud with each other. The urban popu lation of Khurramabad and Biirdjird is mainly Lur, with a sprinkl ing of Jew and Persian merchants. Details of all the Lakks mentioned above will be found else where in this volume. General description. The three divisions already referred to, each have their own typical scenery; no generalisation with regard to Luristan as a whole is possible. In Pusht-i- Kuh, the hills, which rise in tier upon tier, parallel to each other, are lower and less steep than elsewhere in Luristan; gypsums and sandstones predominate: the limestone hills are isolated folds only, the intervening country being filled with shapeless masses of gypsum, grey in colour, contrasting strongly with the red tint of the sandstones. Its rivers are for the most part almost im potable in summer, and its drainage is towards the Mesopatamian plain. It is not well-wooded, and the grazing is not so good as in Luristan. Practicable caravan tracks traverse the country in every direction, and few, if any, hills are so steep as to be impassable for loaded mules. In Pish-i-Kuh the sandstones and gypsums disappear, being seldom met with north of the Saidmarreh valley ; gaunt limestone ranges, almost devoid of wood, south and east of a line drawn from Tarhan to Median Bud take their place : these ranges run uniform ly north-west and south-east, separated by broad grassy valleys: they attain about 6,000' in height. A feature of the district is the extent and fertility of the intervening plains, such as Kuh-i-Dasht, Rumisgan, Hulailan and Tarhan, which could support a large population. The Bald Gariweh (high mountains) district, as the name in dicates, is the most mountainous part of Luristan. The limestone ridges are higher and steeper than those of the Kashgan; and the intervening valleys are narrower, and filled with gypsum or sand-3 ^ of the ^others), • °f Luis 'j ftongh fos Bail- &gt; Dirah- or lead- in popu- spriil- nd else- eir own in as a )arallel ristan; .solated i apeless tie red lost un* itamian d asm mtry in passable c, being imestone ,wnfroin uniform- valleys: let is the d-Dasht, ; a large name in- limestone and the or sand* stone hills, instead of being flat: it is better watered, and thepor ion of the district traversed by a line drawn straight from Khurramabad to Dizful is the most elevated tract in Luristan, and snow is always visible upon its higher peaks. The Bala Garlweh district, south o Khurramabad and north of the Dallch range, is welhwooded with dwarf oak (bedui)* It is possible in Luristan to tell at a glance the geological form ations of a tract, even at a considerable distance. The grey shape less masses of gypsums, the reddish sandstone hills with their irregular outlines, and .the conical hills of grey or blue shale are un- mistakeable, and contrast with the hard conglomerates, resting, as a rule, unconformably upon the older strata, and the great folds of limestone, deeply furrowed by ravines and exhibiting generally equally steep slopes on either side. The ravines which the nveis hive cut through this country are seldom practicable even on loot, the Tang-i-Fani, for instance, is quite impassable without ropes as the fall from the Walmian valley to that of the Saidmarreh is very rapid, and the stream in this gorge falls m consequence over a series of cascades. The Tang-i-Lailum is passable with difficulty by pack animals. Luristan is more scantily populated than the Bakhtiari country, though universally admitted to be the more fertile of the two. This is perhaps due to the anarchy which has characterized the pro ince for many years, and has made agriculture impossible, and pi - vented any Urease of population Uie caravan tracks j ro s t are easier than any others leading from the Gulf to Cential Persia except, perhaps, that via Bandar Abbas and bhiraz. Mountain Ranges. A few ranges deserve special comment: the Kab r Kuh (or Kabbar Kuh) range runs north-north-west from Kuh-i-Shahzadeh Ahmad, overlooking the Dizful plain, to the neighbourhood of Deh Bala. It is pierced by no river, and passes across it aie tew . ti om the south it presents an imposing appearance, its crest consisting in D i ac es of a precipice 1,000' deep. Its northern slope consists of long slopes of barren limestone, deeply furrowed by ravines Every portion of the range has a separate name;, from Shahzadeh Ahmad to Lit Anar, peaks suitable for triangnlation abound, but west of the latter point the crest of the range is remarkably level. Parallel to, and north of, it runs the Kialan range, extending al most unbroken from the Diz to the Kashgan, and variously named . it is pierced by the Zal and Lailum streams which have cut deep gorges through the solid limestone mass.4 Beyond it lies the Dallch range whose precipitous crest runs al most unbroken from the Kashgan eastwards, till it loses itself in the massive xolds of Rid Kuh or Kus. Beyond the Dalich lie tier upon tier of rolling limestone hills, rising 2,000 / or so from the valleys, till at last the edge of the Kuh-i-BawwI plateau is reached, and the broad flat plain of Kurageh, or Dasht-i-Azneh lies at one’s feet, and beyond it, surrounded by mountains, Khuxramabad, the capital of the province, surrounded by orchards and gardens, a veritable oasis in a country of destructive nomads. mvers. The Saidmarreh river is second only to the Kariin amongst the rivers of Peisia, and the area drained by it is probably larger than that of the Karim. It rises in three branches, all springing consi derably east of Kirmanshah, the first, and smallest, 25 miles west of Hamadan; the second has three springs on the slopes of Kuh-i- Alwand, 6 or 8 miles south of that town. The latter runs south west till it meets the former in the plain of Maran about 10 miles south-west of Kangawar, and at a spot nearlylO miles south of that place it is joined by the third and chief branch, coming from the (xQran hills by a north-west course of about 40 miles. x i • Irii^-k of the three united streams, under the name of the Ab-i-Gramasiab (of which the second above mentioned may, from its northern and central position, be considered as the main branch) winds nearly for 30 miles along the Guran mountains. At this celebrated spot, i.e., Bistun, the Gamaslab receives the Ab-i-Dinavar coming from the north, and again, after a course of about 12 miles nearly south-west, another stream called the Qarasu, (passing through t le Kirmanshah plain) at about 20 miles north-north-west of that place. The direction of the main trunk is nearly south, until it receives, at a few miles from thence, a tributary coming from the Gur- ran mountains by a westerly course, and passing by the tomb of Baba Buzurg. Below this junction under the name of Qarasu, it runs south by west for nearly 60 miles, traversing the Kuh Turdulan and the district of Pish-i-Kuh; and, finally, through the great chain of the Zagros to the rums of Shahr-i-Rudbar, which are situated at its con- uence with the river of Kannd. This is a very considerable stream which rises close to the gates of Zagros, and has a tortuous course ot nearly 100 miles m a general south-east direction. In the latter prt of its course it forces its way through the Zagros, by a tremendous mpassable gorge, into the plain of Zangawan, being then at a dis tance of about 12 miles east of the ruins of Shirwan From thence it takes the name of Ab-i-Shuwan, as it passes in a south-south-east direction through the valley of Rudbar, being increased almost at the junction by the Zangawan, the Ab-i-Shirwan, and two other streams, all_of which come from the west (vide “ Birin] an gorge ”)The united waters of Qarasu and Ab-i-Sh'rwan, now called the Saidmarreh, follow the Zagros in a south-south-east direction for about 30 milesy through the plains of Lurt and Saidmarreh ; one mile above the Gamishan bridge, the Saidmarreh is joined on the north east side by the Kashgan, a large stream which rises in two branches in the^ Kuh-i-Chihil Nabalighan, at some distance beyond Khur- ramabad, and after being joined by the united streams of Khurramabad, Kabgan and Tayin the main trunk runs south-west into the plain of Jaidar through a series of deep gorges. At about 22 miles south-east of the Pul-i-Gam shan, the Saidmarreh receives the Ab-i-Garm, a smaller stream coming from the north, through the Pani gorge: * a day’s march south-east from thence is Pubi- Tang, a very remarkable bTidge over a chasm, here 50' deep, and so narrow that a Kurd actually leaped across it, in the presence of Major Rawlinson. Having overcome the obstacle, the river resumes its ordinary size ; and 8 miles lower it is joined by the Ab-i-Zal, which enters it, after a course of about 50 miles from its source in the fast nesses of the Kal-i-IspId and Anareh Riid. The Saidmarreh leaves the mountains west of Dizfiil, within 12 miles of that town, and is hereafter known as the Karkheh. At this spot it is a rapid moun tain stream and at its entrance into the plain, was formerly crossed by a bridge, the remains of which are known as Pa-i-Pul. Immedi ately below this bridge the river is fordable during the summer; this ford is generally used by horsemen, caravans crossing lower down. It then traverses Arabistan and falls into the Shatt-ai-’Arab above Basreh. The Ah-i-Burujird rises midway between Nihawand and Buru- jird at the head of the Silakhor valley, 6 miles west of Ushtarinan and flows south-east past the town whose name it bears. It is also known as Tehij Ab, Ab-i-Darreh, and Lakor Ab at various points. It leaves the S lakhor Pain plain by the Bahrain gorge and cuts its way via the Tang-i-Kalan Kah till it joins the Ab-i-Baznawi (the main branch of the Diz). In its course through the mountains the cliffs, partly conglomerate, partly cretaceous, exude pure pitch. Near the Pul-i-Hawa, a temporary bridge spanning the chasm in which the river flows, is an oil spring below the surface of the water. The Huriid or Ho Rad rises between the Kuh-i-ChavIreh Shah and the Zagheh range and runs north-west down the long open val ley known as Zagheh, Balawand, Darreh Saki, and Kaleh Rahim at various points till it joins .the Kashgan in Alishtar. The Ab-i~Zdl rises near Kuh Anareh Rud and Kal-i-Ispid and runs almost due south through a succession of gorges, for the most part impassable. Rawlinson puts its cource in Kuh-i-Gurji near Gardan Mir ’Abbas Khan, not now identifiable. It reaches the6 Riza plain, in which it effects junction with the Saidmarreh, by two deep canyons, one known as Tang-i-KurnathT, through the Chinara range, which is known east of the Tang as Kamarsi, and to the west as Rustamdau or Takht-i-Chui-i-Zal. Two miles to the south it traverses the Kuseh-Takht-i-Marab range by an impassable gorge known as Kul-i-Zal. Between these ranges lie the ruins of Shahr-i-Chin-i-Zal of great repute amongst Lurs. They consist of a few ruined domed houses of no interest in a fertile hollow, once irrigated: Zal is said to have been Rustam’s father, Chin a woman whose husband was Machin. Tang-i-Kurnatha is passable on foot at all times, and for caravans when the river is low. The water of the stream is clear and free from salt except in summer when it is slightly tainted. The Ab-i-Tirddd joins the Zil a few yards above its junction with the Saidmarreh, after traversing the west end of the Chinara range, here known as Takht-i-Chin-i-Zal by the Tang-i-Gunjab. r Half a mile above its junction with the Zil are the ruins of a Sassa- nian aqueduct or bridge, probably contemporaneous with similar ruins across the ravine of the Zil, in the Riza plain, 1 mile south of Kfil- i-Zal. Two miles further up are a few ruins, probably Sassanian, known as Shahr-i-Gaud. Ab-i-Chandrah or Ab-i-Karind rises near Karind, flows south east through the Karind plain past Haranabad, and down a wide and fertile valley into the Harsin plain, whence it runs south through the Wardilan Kuh by a great rift, some miles long, called Tang-i-Sal- im through which it emerges into the Chaharduwal valley and from these turns south-east. In Chaharduwal it receives tributaries from Zangawar and from the head of the valley, and lower down joins the Saidmarreh. It is 50 yards broad at Tang-i-Sallm. Bdld Rud rises in the Kuh-i-AnurakI and Rid Kuh : its two main branches are Ab-i-Anaraki and Ab-i-Mangarreh which issue from the limestone hills in the Qilab district (the latter by the Tang- i-Zardawar). It passes 5 miles west of Dizfiil and falls into the Diz 11 miles below Dizfiil : it is dry in summer : unfordable after heavy rains for some days at a time. Ab-i-Khnymn or Ab-i-AUshtar. A tributary of the Kashgan rises in Kuh-i-Garru : its chief source is said to be a large spring gushing out of the hill side, a similar spring is said to be found on the opposite side flowing north to the Gamaslab : in the mountain ridge is a deep hole down which Nasr-ud-Dln Shah is said to have ordered a load of chopped straw to be cast, with the result that half emerged from either spring. It flovs through the wooded Jirian gorge, and is joined by th e Kakuueh stream before uniting with the Kashgan.7 ^eh, Y tie H and to les to tie passable ^ ruins of consist of ‘iow, once a woman e on foot 'lie water f wlen it junction * Cbinara -Gunjab,- a Sassa- ilarruii of Kul- ssmian, s south- , a wide . througl mg-i-Sal- rnd from ,ries from joins tie : its twe hicli issue the Tang- into tie able after i Kaslp :ge sprig found 01 mouutii id to 1^ lit that ^ The Kdshgdn river rises in the Kuh-i-Garru and Chihil Nabal- ighan, and is the largest tributary of the Saidmarreh.

The rapidity of its stream makes it difficult to ford, and Lieutenant Wilson found it quite unfordable at Pul-i-Kurr-o-bukhtar in June 1911, and only fordable with diffi culty at Pul-i-Kashgan. The Pul-i-Kashgan (illustrated on pages 204-205, De Morgan) is described as follows by that authorA superb mined Arab bridge, which the Persians have several times clumsily tried to repair, without the least success. Formerly this bridge bore a Kufic inscription, giving the date of construction. the stone which bore the inscription has now fallen and is much worn. Down stream are the remains of two other smaller and older bridges, one of which recalls the Zlsh bridge, and is probably Sassanian : it is most care fully built, the base being of cut stone with boulders at the top : up and down stream the arches are protected by buttresses. The main bridge is several hundred yards long, 60' high, and consists of 14 la^ge arches, and a number of smaller ones. The Pul-i-Kalhur, in the Kashgrn gorge, is a smaller bridge, where the river narrows between walls of rock. The Pul-i-Kurr-o-Dukhtar, at the mouth of Tang-i-Khirsdar, whereby the Kashgan gains access to the Jaidar plain, is even finer than the Pul-i-Kashgan, the piers are faced with cut stone, and are so strongly cemented that one of the fallen piers, which for centu ries has withstood the rush of the waters, is still practically intact . it resembles the Pul-i-Kashgan in general construction. Geology. M. de Morgan has made a special study of the geology of Luri- stan, to which the expert is referred for further information : the following lines are intended only to give a general idea of the form ations encountered. Leaving the alluvial plains of ’Arabistan the first strata met with on a northward journey are conglomerates, resting, in general, unconformably upon the limestones: they are of considerable thickness, and very hard, and their distinctive feature is the abrupt8 cliffs which crown hills capped by this formation. Below them lie red sandstones of varying hardness, alternating with layers of soft rock : this formation, unless protected by a cap of conglomerate, is rapidly worn away: the sandstones rest conformably upon gyp sum or limestone beds and are very sharply tilted : they have a uni form reddish colour. Such sandstones abound south of the Kabir Kuh (which consists of fossiliferous limestones), and round its east ern end. Below the sandstones lie beds of gypsum : in the Bakh- tlari Garmsir they are of great thickness and cover a wide area : in Luristan they are less thick and are not extensive except between the Dallch and Kialan ranges : gypsum beds will, however, be found in every successive valley between the main limestone ranges, lying immediately above the limestone beds. The first of the great con vex limestone folds is the Kabir Kuh, and the Kialan in echelon thereto. The angle of slope on either side of the Kialan is the same, 66 , and the thickness of limestone not less than 2,000, the Ab-i-Fanl gorge showing no trace of having reached the bottom of the limestone strata. Below the limestones lie beds of grey and blue marl, which are exposed on the northern side of Kuh Chinara, accessible only through the Ab-i-Zal gorge, and in the Badamak valley: they are quite soft, and rapidly eroded: it is thus that the Chinara range ex hibits on its northern face a sheer drop of 1,500 / , the limestone break ing awa,y vertically as the marls beneath it are eroded. It also ac- counts for the formation of the Badamak valley which is a denuded saddleback. It is not until Burujird is reached that other than sedimentary formations are met with. From Burujird to Nihawand, at the foot of Kuh-i-Garru or Punch Kuh, finely laminated shales predominate with intrusive veins of marble, and further north granite is found. . . , As is to be expected, there are veins of metallic ores in this re gion , lead occurs near Burujird, and also bituminous coal, whilst there are as yet unconfirmed reports of the existence of gold, and of petroleum, and m the nieghbourhood of Nihawand, of copper. woi,W a ffnr!f 0rga n &lt;P ff- e 45 .’,Y olume IT ) Points out that the marble a ® ord excellent lime if burnt, and states that the calcareous ta, though destitute of fossils, appear to belong to the carboni ferous series : pockets of bitumen are occasionally met with, and he 1—1 ^ 3 • properly conduct ed search would lead to the HebirtWsL' 10 ^ '“P': 113111 * and commercially profitable beds, in quartz ^ that h ® haS SeveraI tlmes met with trace s of copper9 ' w ftem! ^ ers o{ sofj upon gyp, ^’eami.

System of Government. Luristan is a province ruled by a Governor-General appointed or reappointed annually by the Central Government: the incum bent of the post is always, in addition, Governor-General of Buru- jird, though the Deputy Governor of that town is nominated, not by him, but by the Central Government. Pusht-i-Kuh is included in Luristan, though the Wall pays the revenue direct to Kirmanshah. Luristan and 'Arabistan have several times been placed under one Governor-General, with good results, as it enables the Governor- General to bring pressure to bear upon the Lur tribes both in their summer and winter quarters : the province of 'Arabistan yields but little to its Governor-General, the total revenue coming into his hands being insufficient to meet his expenses, as the Shaikh of Moham- mareh, who controls the greater part of the province, generally re mits the dues of the Central Government direct to Tehran. Under the authority of the Governor-General (the Wall of Pusht- i-Kuh is practically autonomous) are the Deputy Governors of Burujird (appointed from Tehran,) and Khurraniabad (nominated by the Governor-General) and a newly created post “ Wall of Pish- i-Kuh” which was conferred on Nazar 'AH Khan, Sardar Akram, by the Persian Government for the first time in 1910. With regard to the remaining tribes, the Governor-General deals direct with the recognised headmen. The province has been in a more or less continuous state of anarchy since early times, and though Persians are fond of calling to mind the good old days when Luristan was in order, the narra tives of De Bode, 1835 ; Rawlinson, 1844; Bell, 1884; De Morgan, 1890; and Lorimer, 1904, indicate that periods of order were separated by lengthy intervals of anarchy. It may be considered, as axiomatic that the revenue can be collected only by force, and that the cost of the necessary militray operations is greater than the revenue, owing to the inefficient way in which the operations are carried out, and the low assessment of the province. Further, that the tribes will not abstain from molesting travellers or from inter necine warfare, unless the Governor-General holds sons of the chiefs concerned, as hostages, and in addition has a punitive force at his disposal. C242GSB10 This force need not be large: the forces of disorder are in capable of organising and are easily dispersed, but it must be well- armed, and efficient, and hitherto no such troops have been sent to Luristan. The regiments despatched have been of the worst type, and have proved a burden, rather than an assistance, to the Governor- General. The policy of every Governor is to pit tribe against tribe, utiliz ing the services of one to coerce the other, such a policy is only tem porarily successful, it ends by impoverishing the district and em bittering tribal relations. Only coercion by an independent force can ensure permanent results. H. H. Salar-ud-Dauleh, Governor- General in 1904 and 1906, is responsible to a large exter.t for the prevailing anarchy. His ideas of government were limited to in citing one tribe to plunder another: he aimed openly at becoming Shah, and sought to enlist the support of Lur tribes, but without success. By his short-sighted policy he encouraged Lur chiefs to harbour hitherto unimagined pretensions, and showed them plainly that the power to make and unmake Governors was in their hands, as Riza Quli, Nizam-us-Sultaneh, his successor, discovered to his cost in 1907, and Muntassir-ud-Dauleh in 1909. The Nizam-us-Sultaneh succeeded in imprisoning the Sag wand chiefs Fazil, Hasan and Gada : shortly afterwards he declared Nazar 'All Khan to be a rebel: the latter retorted effectively by joining forces with the dis contented elements in Khurramabad and besieging the Nizam, who had taken up his quarters in a fort just outside the town. He soon capitulated, and was removed to the house of the Imam Juma’, who took counsel to put him to death. In the meantime the Sagwand chiefs were released and joined Nazar ’AH, who issued a manifesto to the Sagwand in’Arabistan in which he indicated his intention of attacking the Wall. Thrown on his wits, the Nizam-us-Sultaneh succeeded in addressing a letter to the townspeople, pointing out the terrible consequences that would accrue to the town, were his sacred person abused. The argument was taken up to such good purpose that the people, realising already that their Lur masters were in no way preferable to the Governor-General of the day, rose en masse, released and reinstated the latter, and imprisoned the Imam Juma’. The Sagwand Khans, seeing the tide had turned, fled, and have not since returned to Khurramabad. The Nizam-us-Saltaneh’s influence had disappeared, however, and he left soon afterwards and was appointed Governor-General of Kfrmanshah. He was succeeded by Sardar Flruz, whose brief career was un eventful, as he made no attempt to leave Burujird or collect revenue. His successor Muntassir-ud-Dauleh was less discreet; he killed Sarum-es-Saltaneh, chief of one of the local regiments, and himself11 r «e i n . ; be well- 1 sent to rst typo ) overnor.

He was attacked and defeated, his gnns captured, and himself forced to fly the town. After a short interregnum the Governor-Generalship was con ferred on Lutf 'Ali Khan, Amir Mufakham, Bakhtiari, whilst Murtaza Quit Khan, his cousin, was made Governor of the Thalatheh, or three provinces of Nihawand, Tusar Khan, and Malaylr. An army of about 5,000 men was collected, including 1,000 Bakh- tiaris, and in June a move was made towards Khurramabad. Hos tilities were at once commenced by the Bairanwand : more by good luck than by any pretence at strategy, which was conspicuously lacking on either side, the Bairanwand chief Fazil Khan was killed. On his death his adherents fled panic-strickesn, and were not long afterwards looted by the victorious army, which had as yet scarcely fired a shot. Of such stuff are Lurs made. A word must be said as to the present influence of the Wall of Pusht-i-Kuh on Luristan affairs. He is now powerless to affect the course of events in any way. In 1908, when offered the^ Gov ernor-Generalship, he refused, ostensibly because 10,000 tumans more was demanded, than he Was prepared to pay, but in reality probably because the task was beyond him. His power has now been reduced, owing to the revolt of his son, and it may safely be said that he is unlikely to take any active part in Luristan politics. Revenue. The revenue dues of the Central Government from Luristan proper are understood to be 60,000 tumans on the old assessment, but this term was used by Nazar ’Ali Khan to refer to a figu e of 36,000 tumans in 1911, and by the Wall of Pusht-i-Kuh (who was asked to be responsible for 80,000 tumans) in 1908 to mean 50,000 tumans. The revenue demand which includes the Governor-GeneraPs salary and expenses, varies from year to year. The Salar-ud-Dauleh demanded 123,000 tumans in 1906, his successor Amir Afkham obtained 73,000 tumans made up as follows Tumans.

The three great divisions of Luristan, which I have referred to in pervious chapters, may conveniently be adopted in discussing the tribes of the province, but before doing so, a few generalisations on the subject are permissible.- All are now either Lurs or Lakks ; no Turk tribes are to be found in the province, and the “ ’Arab Gan Mish” tribes of the Bakhtiari country find no counterpart in Luris tan. Certain tribes, however, such as the Sagwand, trace their descent to ’Arab immigrants. Kurd tribes, such as the Kalhur, live on the borders of the province, but are subject to the Kirmanshah Government and are therefore excluded from consideration here. Other Kurd tribes live in Pusht-i-Kuh, but of the tribes of that great sub-division I propose to say nothing, as the subject has been fully dealt with by Captain Lorimer in his report. i The boundary between Lurs and Lakks is now only linguistic ; the Lurs are probably Aryans by descent and of aboriginal stock. It is fairly certain they have lived a nomadic life for many centuries. The word Lur is deservedly a term of contempt amongst Persians and even amongst Lurs themselves ; it is synonymous with a boor and a robber, and has doubtless always been so. The tribes of Elam “ set at nought the authotity of the Medes and Persians, defied Alexander and provoked Antiochus ” (Curzon), but there is ample evidence that until the Middle Ages, Luristan was occupied by a considerable sedentary population, to which the rivers and mounds which abound west of the Kashgan, and in the valley of the Said- marreh, bear witness. Important centres were Khurramabad, Rumishgan, Tarhan, Kuh-i-Dasht, Saidmarreh, Lurt and the Riz^ plain. The principal trade routes, which were carefully protected, and on which large sums were expended in bridging and grading' ran, (1) up the Saidmarreh valley across Pul-i-Tang and again across Pul-i-Gamishan, thence across Jaidar to Pul-i-Kurr-o-Dukhtar, Madian Rud, and Pul-i-Kashgan whence to Nihawand and Khur ramabad ; (2) from Rumishgan via Madian Rud Pul-i-Kalhur to Khurramabad; (3) Dizful-Qllab-Khurramabad. Of the latter track little is known : traces of paving with boulders occur frequently be tween Dizful and Qilab, and Lurs report ruins of bridges of cut stone, and frequent remains of paving, along the rest of the route. The distinction between Lakks and Lurs is, as has been remarked above, by no means clear. Morier writes of the Lakks:—“A nomadic tribe of Persia, who are generally dispersed through that country, but whose chief seats are about Qazvln, and in the province of Ears and Mazandaran. It is a large tribe, sub-divided into many families, and is oi Pets thieves. wand, Their ^ ]y h citi Rabi Lakks.

The Zends are Lakks, and are renowned as thieves. Their chief families are Bairanwand, and JalTlawand. Khoja- wand, ’Abdul Maliki, Nadawand, Shuja Wakhshan andKakawand. Their total numbers are reckoned at 20,000 houses : they live part ly in cities and partly in the plain/’ Babino considers the Dilfan, Silsileh and Bairanwand to be Lakks. The ’All Ullahl sect has many adherents amongst Lakks and Kurds : a detailed account of their beliefs and rites will be found in Rabino’s gazetteer. Fire walking is certainly still practised : certain hills and woods are sacred (as at Maleh Kalandar). They believe in a series of successive incarnations of God, who is constantly present in some of their number. They are not interfer ed with, and on their part conform outwardly in the towns to the Shi’ah faith, and observe great reticence as to their customs. Manners and Customs of Lurs. Some knowledge of the manners and customs of Lurs is a great help in dealing with them, and makes it much easier to gain their confidence. They have no aristocracy, and are intensely democratic, but, like other democratic peoples, readily swayed by individuals who have gained their respect and confidence ; their leaders have attained their position by their own force of character, or that of their immediate ancestors, and the position, though hereditary, can only be retained by men who give daily evidence of their power to lead and influence others. The material resources, upon which a chief can rely to assist him in maintaining his authority, are slender : he has little cash, and his retainers are prepared to serve him only so long as he is successful: he must rely on public plunder to reward his followers. Under such conditions the fittest undoubtedly survive, but they are not a very pleasant type. Lurs are not fanatical, though prejudiced against, and often hostile to foreigners as such: amongst the Bala Gariweh the sight of a man saying his prayers is uncommon, and the older men have no idea of the formulae of prayer, or the elements of their faith, though an oath on the Quran is considered very binding, and is not broken oftener by Lurs than by Persians. They consider an oath obligatory only so long as the circumstances which gave rise to it hold good, and broken oaths which come within this exception are not reprobated.16 A Qajar oath is synonymous in Buristan with an oath falsely taken with treacherous intent, so often have princely Governors, from the^Zill-us-Sultan downwards, stooped to such means to bring the Lur ^chiefs within their grasp, as a prelude to cutting their throats. A classical example of this is the murder by the Zill-ua* Sultan of Hussan Quli Khan Bakhtlari in Ispahan. Lurs live in black goat hair tents of indifferent construction, without sidewalls as a rule, brushwood being used instead. Unlike Arabs, who tend to congregate in large camps, they pitch their tents in widely scattered groups of 3 or 4, each petty chief or group of families having its own encampment, liable to be robbed by others. Large camps are a certain indication of the presence therein of some important chief. The reception tent is, amongst Lurs, pitched in front of the general alignment; amongst Arabs, it is in the alignment and to the right flank. In early summer they &gt; desert their tents for booths made from the branches of trees. Lurs are polygamous, but few, except the chiefs, can afford the luxury of more than one wife. Their standard of morality is very low, like that of Persians generally, and they have not the intelli gence or modesty to conceel their feeUngs. Their independent and quarrelsome nature has taught them the necessity of restraint when tribal affairs are being discussed, and the proceedings of such gatherings are generally marked by good temper on all sides, even when such vital topics, as blood feuds, com pensation for robbery, etc., are being discussed. Their moder ation of language, and self-restraint, on such occasions, is in mark ed contrast to the outbreaks of ill temper which characterize Bakh- tlaris. The reason is to be sought in the conditions of life in Luristan j a hasty word may very well involve a blood-feud and loss of life. Lurs are superstitious, those of Luristan perhaps more so than others. Some of their customs are common to the rest of Persia, &gt; such as the erection of piles of stones on peaks and passes in sight of a holy place, the making of such piles being accompanied by the expression of some wish they trust may thereby be satisfied. Of similar import is the tying of a rag torn from their clothing to the branch of a sacred tree. “ Istikhareh ”, or selecting a passage from the Quran at random, as an omen previous to a journey or under taking, is widely practised. Chains and amulets for the protection of the body, generally obtained from Saiyids, are widely worn. Pilgrimages to certain Lur shrines, such as Shahzadeh Ahmad (the end of the Kabir Kuh) and Ahmad Kuchikeh (near Jauzar) are undertaken not infrequently by men and women alike.17 'Onstnictk Un| ' pitc| ^ iief oi gioj ( robbed I is present is, among! ;st Arabs,!

The shrine of greatest repute amongst the Bala Garlweh tribes is Shatzadeb Ahmad, a peak at the W. end of Kabir Kub (pronounced Kabbar Kuh by Lurs). It is said to be a place where a certain ohahzadeh Ahmad was killed. His sons were killed elsewhere, one N. of the Kialan, and one at the spot known at Shah Ah mad Kuchikeh near Jauzar. As the tribes pass the latter spot, every man, woman and child enters a little enclosure, with bared feet kissing the rough pile of stones and tying a piece of his dress to the sticks that surmount it. Genuine reverence is shown in the cere mony, in which the Muhammadan faith plays no part. At night when within sight of a holy place, such as Shahzadeh Ahmad, the women will stand, torch in hand, facing the shrine, murmuring their petitions Oh, Shah Ahmad, help me to recover the cow that has strayed ‘‘Let my next be a boyp” etc., etc. After a time the torch is placed on the ground and allowed to burn out. The custom like the holy places, is probably much older than Muhammadanisin which is of quite recent adoption in Luristan. Another important shrme is that of Shah Ahmad in the Qalawand country. The Silsileh and Dilfan were largely ’All Ullahls originally but have gradually become Shi’ahs by profession : the shrine deem ed most holy by them is Bala-Buzurg, in the hills S. E. of Kir- manshah. In their intercourse with Europeans, Lurs are generally tolerant and, according to their lights, polite. Their chiefs are not entirely mannerless, and do not scruple to eat and drink out of the same dish with a farangi ; nor do they spit as they leave a European’s presence, as is the charming custom of many other better edncat- ed teliow; co nntrymen. Their salutations are simple. “ Salam alaiqum ” is more often than not replaced by “ Khuda Hafiz ” Wb m coming and going: when a Lur enters a tent, before seating hlm- selb he will address each person whom he knows by name e n KWrti-fi ^ ’ “V mid - !

C2 42 GSB18 Amleh .—Formerly known as “ Ami eh Karim Khan” A small isolated Lur clan of Pusht-i-Kub, originally living in a few walled villages S. W. of Dizful in 'Arabistan. Subject to raids by Kananeh and Khasrij Arabs and by Sagwand, with whom they have a feud, but are generally able to hold their own, though they cannot muster more than 200 rifles and 40 or 50 sowars. Thier lands are irrigated by the Harmushi and Dehdari canals from the Karkheh. The relationship of their chief to the Wall of Pusht-i-Kuh is shown by the following table :— PapI Qalb ’Ali, 1 .. Baqir | Brother of GurgI K. and ] Haidar K., uncle of present | Karim Wall of P. K. Aziz— Nabi. Hussain-Sarhang (It . ’Abbas-Isfandiar (5). (’Ali Marddn (40) Saif-ud-Dauleh (8). I ] Muhammad-Ghulam Riza (28). | dr. m. to ’AH Riza, brother of Hussain i Quit K. Walt. ’Abdul Riza (43). Their blood-feud with the Sagwand arose from the killing of Agha Riza Sagwand’s son Jamshir by Ghulam Riza, whilst the former was raiding the Amleh's lands in 1910, but an older blood-feud was previously in existence. The present chief, ’Ali Mardan, is a short black-bearded man, not popular personally, and less respected than his aged father Karim Khan used to be. He is supposed to receive pay for 20 frontier guards from the Persian Government. His village is 3 m. N. W. of Shush near a mound surmounted by a small fort. Baharwand .—Also known as Miraliwand, from the founder of the tribe, a brother of Kurd ’Ali who gave his name to another sec tion of the Dirakwand {q. v.). They are controlled by Kadkhudas of the family of Mlrall, whose descendants Kaku and Bawak are also referred to as founders of the tribe. This family ousted the Mirs, who formerly ruled the tribe, and have since remained on bad terms with them.The following genealogical tree will be found useful Kadkhudds of the Bahdrwand.

The maximum number of rifles the tribe could raise is, I should say, about 500, and though they probably number rather over 1,000 families I doubt if they could put more than 1,000 men into the field : when they fought the Mirs in 1911, they certainly had not over 250 rifles and 500 men available. Divisons. The Baharwand Mirs are described elsewhere; excluding them from consideration, the only divisions we have to consider are the Kadkhuda/s section, and theNajaftan. The latter are a small and weak clan, living apart from the main body of the tribe, wintering near Kaleh Husainyeh, spending the summer on the N. slopes of Kuh-i-Grird, and moving between these points by a route crossing the E. end of the Chinara range and the K. Kargishan. Their Kadkhudas are descended from Kahii, but are only distantly related to those mentioned above, with whom they have20 few practical dealings ; the only representatives I have met of them are Pasha (40) and Mira Haji (60). They have, however, marriage relations with the Qalawand Mirs, with whom they are on fairly good terms. Habitat .—In winter this tribe’s tents will be found anywhere from the Ab-i-Zal bridge to within a few miles of Dizfiil on the W. side of the Bala Bud. In summer they live on the slopes of K. Hashtad Pahlu and Bawwi, and the valley of the Shiirab, Kuh-i-Taf, Darrehd-Nassab, Tang-i-Bahram Kush, Ab-i-Siwak. When anarchy prevails in Luristan, and the authorities of Khurramabad are unable to assert themselves, the tribe moves down to Kurageh and Shah- in-Shah, and terrorizes the townspeople. In their migrations they follow, as a rule, the Kalan route (No. 3), but when on bad terms with the Mirs they follow that via Chul (No. 4). Cultivation .—They sow wheat and barley near Ab-i-Lailum and Ab-i-Fani, and also in the Darreh-i-Nassab, and elsewhere near their summer quarters. Such crops, in the high country, are all irrigated and ripen in autumn, whilst those in the Said Marreh valley are unirrigated and ripen in early summer. Miscellaneous .—tribe is the strongest of the Dlrakwand sections ; its chiefs are rough and uncouth, but treated Dr. Wilson well in 1911, when, for a sum of _150 tumans they took him up to Khurramabad from Pizful, coming into collision on vouto with the Mirs, of whom they killed two. The best of the Kadkhudas is Baruni, a man of about 40, uncouth and rough, but unassuming, and according to Dr. Wilson’s experience, prepared to keep his word. Husain Khan is a plausible ruffian, ready for any treachery, but* like his fellows, afraid of BarCim who wields great influence. The tribe is a prosperous one, with large flocks, many mares and a fair number of mules, but the latter are not available for purchase at a reasonable rate. Habits.—-Their habits, generally speaking, are those of other Lur tribes, which will be found described elsewhere, a few peculiarities may, however, be mentioned. Their patron saint, invoked on all occasions with a reputation equal, if not superior, to that of ’All is bliahzadeh Ahmed, whose shrine is at the end of the Kabir Kuh and must not be confused with Shah Ahmad whose shrine is in Qalawand territory, or Ahmed Kuchikeh near Jauzar. The flav of truce a pole surmounted with a rough device cut out of tin, beneath winch are cluster of parti-coloured rags, is known as “ Shazadeh Baliarwand Mirs.—Kno-wn as “ Aulad-i-’Abbas Khan and dependents. This section is notorious, chiefly on account of theii treacherous conduct m 1904 towards Major Douglas and Lieutenanl21 J tiet of however % aij a nywlieft mthe | es of 1 ^-i-Taf, ; fl anarcli| Je unable nd Sbah. •ions they oad terms ■i-Lailiim here near I, areal d Marrei ra kwa^ .

They lid d bound themselves on oath to conduct Lieuteiia nt Lorimer from Dizf Ql to Khurramabad and back for 100 tumans each way, to which a sum of 30 tumans was afterwards added by Lieute nant Lorimer, owing to difficulties on the way up. When 37 miles from Khurramabad, on the way down to Dizf ul, the Mirs demanded a further sum of 500 tumans, which was subsequently reduced to 200 tumans which latter snm Major Douglas agreed to pay. He had scarcely done so when he saw his tent a nd that of Lieutenant Lorimer being looted. The latter who resisted was knocked senseless with a stone, besides receiving a bullet wound in the handi Major Douglas was also severely wounded. The party, having been robbed of all they possessed, were hustled back to Khurramabad with a few blankets, all the animals and kit having been stolen. The excuses given by the chiefs for the t«*a reaction were typical. They alleged that they had sealed the Quran only for the up journey, and not for the return to Dizf ul; that their agreement with regard to the latter was verbal only, and that in consequence they were at liberty to do as they thought fit. As a matter of fact their oath cover ed the double journey. The Farman Farma, after a long delay, was sent with a force to punish them : he was accompanied by Lieutenant Williams, I.M.S., Consular Surgeon at Kirmanshah. After some indecisive and futile military operations, he effected the capture of the following Mirs through the instrumentality of Hasan Khan Sagwand; it was the f cuit of Persian diplomacy, or, in other words, treachery and an oath on the Quran violated. Principal Mirs .—Mir Haji, Nazar!’All his son, Saiyid Mahad, Jafar, ’Ali, Nishat, Khani, Farhad,’Isa, Taimur, Sarhang, Ismail, and As’ad. The Mirs who were with Lieutenant Lorimer, when he was attacked, were Tatar, Sarhang, Sardar (brother of Bakhi) Baba, Nazar ’Ali Qasim, Khani, Bawar, ’Alim, Naqi, Shah Buzurg, Ismail; most of the Aulad-i-Mir ’Abbas Khan. Other important Mirs are Mir Ma Taqi; Mir Kashkfil, and Mir Namdar. It has been generally considered that the punishment inflicted on them by the Persian Government, after much pressure by H. M/s Legation was ineffective, and not sufficient to act as a deterrent. Their attitude towards Lieutenant Wilson in 1911 indicates that this is the case. The punishment they received, however, was not light. One man was blown from a gun, another died in prison, many remained prisoners for nearly 2 years, when the Salar-ud-Daulef* released them. Much of the plunder they had taken was recovered by the last-named, who, however, kept most of it lot22 himself. The loss in prestige which they suffered has had a perma nent effect on the fortunes of the tribe, and they are now less formid able than they were 6 years ago. Bairanwand .—Generally classed as of the Bala Garlweh division. Described by Rabino as Lakks, but this seems open to question. The strongest of the tribes of Luristan numbering pro bably 10,000 families at least; well armed: inhabit the plains of Alishtar and Khaweh, and the Kuh-i-Chihil Nabalighan and Garru in summer. A proportion, varying from year to year, migrate to Pusht-i-Kuh in the autumn, moving usually via Kal-i-Hasar, Chul and Pul-i-Tang. Considered by Lurs to be the wildest and least amenable of Lur tribes: they devastated the valleys of Silakhor PainandSTlakhor Bala in 1908-10, and their depredations extended eventoMalaylrandNihawand. They defeated Muntassir-ud-Dauleh near Burujird in 1910 and captured a field gun; Amir Mufakham, however, defeated them at the outset of his campaign and killed their best known Chief, Fazil. They have for many years paid no revenue. They were assessed 20 years ago at 6,000 tumans, and at present at 18,000 tumans. They are on good terms with the Sardar Akram; the Dalwand are allied to them. Sub-divisions .—Yar Ahmad, Mai As’ad, Sabz ’All, Shams, Zain ’Ali, Chakalwand Tari, Astan Marz, Mattash, Mustafa wand, Farrash, Garr, Mihrab, Jujehwand, Shahun, ShahvardI, Daliran, Chalabl’ Charmarang, Plrdadeh, Dilfan, Aulad-i-As’ad Khan, Aulad-i- ’Ali-Mahmud.

They are homogeneous to the extent that they have never accepted the rule of any individual, nor pay taxes with any regularity, but the Sagwand and Bairanwand are quite sepa rate from the rest of the group. They were estimated in 1836 by Rawlinson at 6,000 families ; Layard, 1846, made the same estimate, and (if the Bairanwand be excluded as was done by both authorities) the figure to-day appears to be the same, as far as it is possible to make an estimate. The SakI tribe, formerly included in this group, is extinct. The Makan ’All tribe, formerly shown as one of this group is now unknown; it was merged in the Sagwand many years ago. The Bajulwand tribe has likewise ceased to be an independent unit. Bdldwand .—Classed by some as Dulfan: Khang Mahmud and Lutf ’Ali. Under the influence of the Sardar Akram at present, but formerly under ’All Riza Khan of Pusht-i-Kuh : Rabino states them to number 300 families; to live in the Hulailan districts in winter near Said Manch; tribal divisions Balawand and Kaushwand. Plowden gave numbers at 1,000 families and said they paid 3,000 tfimans p. a. revenue. Chigini .—A tribe living between Khurramabad and the Kashgan river at the foot of Kuh-i-Safid. Their principal divisions are Tahmasp KhanI, Hatim Kham, Fathullahi and Hajiha. The .Hatim KhanI section includes the now extinct Mlrzawand : no recognised chiefs. The divisions of Tahmasp KhanI section are Hap, Sabzwar Budaq, Fathullah Juma’t Karim, Hatimwand, Shakarwand and Waiskareh. Those of the Hatim KhanI section are Husiwand, Mirzawand, Sharaf, Darwlsh, Hammamand Jawwar. For practical purposes their masters are Agha Rabbia and his brother* the Beglerbegi of the Chaqarwand family of Khurramabad, but their authority is not great. This tribe forcibly extorted some 50 tumans from Lieutenant Wilson in June 1911, though he was travelling under the auspices of the above-named leaders, and in company with Mirza Hidayat, the Beglerbegi’s son. They are said to number 2,000 families: their proper assessment is 3,000 tumans : the Sardar Akram on behalf of Government managed to get 1,200 tumans in 1910. Dalwand .—Now allied with Bairanwand live in Ho Rud valley all the year round; sedentary for the most part, Kadkhudas Khanjan and Sikal. They are supposed to pay 2,000 tumans in cash and kind. They sold their lands near Zagheh to the Nizam-us-Sultaneh for 200 tumans in 1907. *For a note on these persons see page 47.25 As’aduMDii: )f tiie kk l Gamm: li. ; jli deiaul' heirtenitop ifiereDt afe.

The struggle was terminated by the latter's death. His hving relations seem well enough satisfied with the existing regime. He has passed through stormy times^ and survived the active hostility of the Wall and the Salar-u-dauleh: “ he has eaten,' as he told Lt. Wilson “ both chains and the stick ” and has sworn never to enter a town, nor to deliver himself into the hands of any Governor-General on any pretext. He is personally bold, but has no large force at his disposal, and in his struggles with his foes has generally had to seek safety in flight. He owes his strength to the solidarity of his tribe and territory, and to the fact that he lies off the route of the big nomadic tribes. To his own character, however, (he is a typical Lur) must be mainly attributed his success, and to the unusual degree of authority he can wield. In appearance he is unprepossessing: a confirmed opium smoker, and heavy drinker ; medium in height, quiet and careworn, sus picious in manner, though not so much so as is the case with many Lur chiefs. Captain Lorimer in 1904 and Lieutenant Wilson in 1911 found him friendly in a practical way, and ready to discuss developments of British influence in his territories. He is at present allied with Amanullah Khan, the Wall's son, and Daud Khan Kalar, and is therefore in a very strong position. He shows no desire however to oppose the Governor General actively though he incited the Bairanwand to make unreasonable demands of the Amir Mufakham, the outcome of which was their complete defeat by the latter. The Dilfan were assessed at 8,000 tumans, Zill-es-Sultan got 12.000 tumans. Salar-ud-Dauleh demanded 16,000 tumans and got 5.000 tumans. See also article on Silsileh.

Hablbullah (with Wali in Saidmarreh) (hostile to Nazar ’Ali,)26 DiraJcwand .—The name given to a congerie of tribes inhabiting the mountains between Khurramabad and Dizful, extending on the E. to near the Ab-i-Diz, which they are precluded however from reaching by the intervening Pap I tribe (q. v.) ; and on the W. to the neighbourhood of the main caravan track, which from Badamak to Dad.ibad inns through territory claimed by the Judeki, who are in actual occupation of the lands itervening between it and the Kashgan river. They form part of the Bala Gariweh group (q. v.) of the Pish- Kuh division of Lur-i-Kuchak.* The tribe consists of several sections the principal of which are as follows—(1) Baharwand, (2) Qalawand, (3) Baharwand Mi'rs, (4) Qalawand or Mungareh Mfrs, (5) Kurd Aliwand, (6) Mihr Aliwand, 7) Rizawand, (8) KurkI, (9) Mlrzawand, (10) Mungari. V The Zainiwand, who now live in Pusht-i-Kuh near Saidmarreh fort, are of D^rakwand stock, but are no longer reckoned as such, having left their old grounds for the protection of the Wall some 20 years ago {vide Captain LorimePs report on Pusht-i-Kuh). The strength of the true Dirakwand is small, probably not over 3,000 men, of whom 1,500 are armed; but there is a strong foreign element of Sagwand, Hasanwand and Bairanwand. 4,000 men, of whom 2,000 have rifles, is probably a fairly close approximation to the actual strength of the tribe: but they could never put half this number in the field simultaneously. Of this total, the Baharwand and Qalawand would contribute about one quarter each. They have probaoly kept at about this figure for many years. The various tribes are discussed below in detail, and the reader is referred to the separate notes on each tribe for details as to headmen movements, etc. Some 11 years ago the late Wall of Pusht-i-Kuh, Husain Quli, was induced by the _ Hishmat-ud-Dauleh, Governor of Luristan, p° ir-i 1 1L 1 al l ^ crn shing the Dirakwand.

It has not since been reopened to traffic. The tribe are notorious for their predatory habits, but this is because they are on the main caravan road between Dizful and Buriijird, and have had greater opportunities than other tribes of exercising their talent in this direction, at the expense of the general public. So far as the writer has observed, their ingrained love of theft is characteristic of all Lurs without distinction. They rob and pillage not only outsiders, but members of their own tribe: the blood feuds, which are one of the chief pre-occupations of their chiefs, arise almost entirely from the killing of a member of the tribe, when in the act of robbing some other family or clan, and vice versa. In such a case the right of defence of property against attack, whether by day or night, is not held u to justify the shooting of the guilty party, whether deliberately or by accident; and com pensation is exacted, but according to no fixed scale, the sole criterion being the strength of those who make the demand, and the ability of the weaker party to pay. Blood is only exacted for blood, when there is no chance of obtaining its pecuniary equivalent. The whole tribe is held responsible for the payment of such debts; and their settlement is a matter for discussion between the heads of tribes, and not between the parties immediately responsible. The present family of Bakhtiarl Khans is said to be of Dirakwand stock, but there is no confirmation of this available. See also articles on Bala Garlweh, Bafiarwand, Baharwand Mirs, Kurd ’Aliwand, Qalawand, and Qalawand Mirs. Faili .—Writers have claimed that this term applies to all Lurs of Luristan (Lux-i-Kuchak) but Curzon correctly remarks that “ it has become restricted in popular usage to Pusht-i-Kuh the Failis proper constituting the bulk of the population in that district (Persia and the Persian Question, p. 275, Yol. II). For details regarding them reference is invited to Captain Lorimer’s report of 1908. The Wall of Pusht i-Kuh used to be known in Arabistan as “ The Faili ” or else by the cognomen, which has been bestowed upon his family by his Arab neighbours, doubtless with good reason, “ Abu Qadareh ” father of sword. Khurramabad is still known officially and by tradition as “ Khurramabad-i-Faili ”, a relic of the days when his forbear Husain Khan, Chief of the Faili tribe, was placed by Shah ’Abbas in the posi tion formerly held by Shah Wardi Khan, and granted the title of Wall in exchange for that of Atabeg, with almost unlimited powers in Luristan. With the diminution of the power of his successors,of theKhamseh and the Daulatshah sections are Daud, Sabz ’Ali, and Zain-ul ’Abdin. AH Muhd. leads the Bastan section. Judehi .—Some times said to be of Bajulwand stock (q.v.). Their Chiefs are ’Abbas and Fathullah, cousins, now reconciled, but not on cordial terms; their influence, which was established by a seriesof murders of their brothers and cousins, rare even in the annals of Luristan, has now decreased, and the Kadkhudas do much as they like. They occupy the lands between the Kashgan and the main Dizful-Khurramabad caravan route, claiming Jaidar, Badamak, Chimashk, and Raikhan as their own ; but their headquarters are at Chul-i-Hiil and they have not cultivated land elsewhere, for some years past, except in Jaidar. Their habits are similar to those of the Dirakwand ; they winter in Jaidar. They are assessed at 1,500 tumans, but do not pay anything. The Salar-ud-Dauleh looted 5,000 tumans from them. Kakdwand .—One of the most formidable tribes of Luristan, being conveniently placed to raid Kirmanshah and the main trade routes, and far from the headquarters of the G-overnor General of Luristan, who is responsible for their good behaviour. They live near Harsin on the border of the province, and though nominally part of the Dilfan, are but little under the influence of Nazar All Khan. Their Chiefs are: Baqir K.'(Shahab-ul-Lashkar). Ibrahim K. son of Karmullah K. Sartip. Tahmasp K. son of Riza As’ad “ Baijuz”. They have raided extensively in the past few years in the Kirmanshah, Harsin, Kangawar, and Nihawand districts.

It was formerly used to denote the country inhabited by Lurs beyond the boundaries of Luristan, and includes in consequence the Bakhtiari country, and the whole of Fars. It was never an administrative province, the Bakhtiari Haft Lang in 1841 being under Burujird, the Kuhgalh under Behbahan, and the Qashqai under the Governoi General of Fars at Shiraz, who is now in charge of both the last- named tribes, as Behbahan is within Fars. Lur-i-KuchaJc. — This term, now obsolete, denotes the province of Luristan. It was formerly divided into Gulak, which included ’Amleh and Bala Gariweh, and Selewerzi, which included Dilfan and Silsileh, but these divisions are now unknown. Mlrs. (DlraJcwand ).— Vide Baharwand Mirs and Qalawand Mirs, Papi. r A numerous but little known tribe living E. of Khurramabad, between the Dirakwand country and the Diz. They are nomadic! but never quit this district as a tribe: their habitations are the ordinary black tents of the nomad. Their country is well watered and abundantly wooded. In 1911 Lieutenant Wilson was shown specimens of iron pyrites and bituminous coal from this district. ? They are assessed at 700 tumans, but pay nothing. Their chief is Ali Murad Khan said to be 100 years old, but the management of affairs is in the hands of his son and one Haji 5 Ali. They are said to be able to collect 1,000 armed men. Sawyer (1890) found them living in the valley of Darband at the S. of the Silakhor plain. 1,000 tents. 1,500 tumans mdlidt. Pish-i-Kuh. This term is applied to the Lur districts and tribes, other than those of Pusht-i-Kuh and Bala Gariweh, but is now seldom heard except m connection with the title of Wall of Pish-i- • i ^ ar ^ r Akram by the Persian Government in 1910.

It follows therefore that there is less cohesion amongst them than amongst the Baharwand. Like the latter tribe, they were originally ruled by Mirs, who were ousted by the Kad khudas and formed a separate unit, the Mirha-i-Mungarreh or Mirha-i-Qalawand. The principal Kadkhudas are as follows:— (1) Qandi and his sons Zaqi and Baba Khan. (2) Hazir Beg and his son Kuchak 'All; Note .—Their Mullas are : Mullas MaTaqi, Ri- za, and ’All Karim. (3) Fdzil. (4) ’Ali Muhammad. Numbers. —They approximate in numbers to the Baharwand, t. e., rather over 1,000 families, but they are more dispersed than the latter, and less able to produce a fighting force at short notice. Habitat. —In winter they extend from the Qilab district to within a few miles of Dizfdl, keeping to the E. of the Bala Rud. In summer they inhabit the valleys and slopes of Knh Hashtad PahlQ, K. Aslabad, Tiri Kuh, etc. ; they seldom visit Khurram- abad. Cultivation. —-They cultivate particularly a considerable area of good land in the Qilab district; and have small portions of irrigated cultivation at the head waters of the Zal. Miscellaneous. —This tribe has a bad reputation for thieving, robbery and general untrustworthiness, which, as far as I could judge, they fully deserve. I visited them in March 1911 in order to see the Qilab oil springs (w'de page 54), and to get to know the tribe. The chiefs were friendly, but rough and uncouth,; they are fairly prosperous, but less so than the Baharwand. Habits. —They are distinguished from other nomad tribes by the fact that they rarely visit Khurramabad, and could, in consequence, be controlled to some extent were they forbidden, in case of mis behaviour, to enter Dizful, which is their market town. Their predatory habits have already been noted. The late Isfandiar Khan, Bakhtiari, some years ago, attacked them suddenly and punished them heavily. They have not yet forgotten the lesson he taught them, and the rumoured approach of a Bakhtiari force in 1911 was sufficient to send them hastily back to their hills.32 Qaldwand Mlrs .— Also known as Mirha-i-Mungarreh and the Aulad-i-Mir ’All Khan.

Ihe £ ormer group rated ^ ^years ago from the two main sections of the tribe, and found comparative peace and quiet under the aegis of the Wall. They are said to number about 500 families. Agha Riza is a sensible man, whom Captain Lorimer found friendly to Europeans. The relations of Fazil Khan, and Hasan Khan, who in 1906 received from the Salar-ud-Dauleh the titles of llkhani and llbegl, have long been intimate ; they act in conceit in all matters, and share whatever spoils of office may accrue to them. With them are associated the other descendants of Rustam and Safar. The attached genealogy shows clearly the relationship of the various chiefs. Fazil Khan, is a man of about 30: blind in one eye, with a long bl ,ck beard. Lurish in manner and tongue, naturally treacherous but ostensibly friendly. He takes little part in the external affairs of the tribe, which he leaves in the hands of Hasan Kh in. Out of jealousy towards Hasan Khan, he did his best to hamper Lieu tenant Wilson's movements. Hasan Khan is about 40 years of age; he suTers from indigestion. He was most helpful to Lieutenant Wilson in 1911, and wields con siderable influence with neighbouring tribes. He is more of a Persian than Fazil, but has most of the characteristics of a Lur; with him is associated his cousin Sartip K. (T pa) who holds a position of some authority in the tribe, but has little to recommend him to an outsider. The traditional role of the Sagwand Chiefs is that of Plshkar to the Governor-General of Luristin. To each successive Governor they have offered their services to enable him to collect the revenue, and reduce other tribes to submission, their reward being a percentage on the amount recovered. So long as a steady stream of more or less competent Governors was assured, the Sagwand prospered, and they were at the height of their power when Salar-ud-Dauleh was Governor. On his departure, the Sagwand found important elements in Luristan opposed to them, and suffered a considerable reduction in number and prestige. The arrival of Nizam-us-Sultaneh (then Sardar Mukarram) assist ed them but little; his reputation both as a man and a Governor is very bad in the province. He is dispised as one who is treacherous and untrustworthy, but also inefficient and unsuccessful. At first he attempted to make use of the Sagwand, but before long became alienated from them by their refusal to hand over the little son of a Bairanwand chief, who had been left with the Sagwand as security for payment of 12,000 tamans of revenue, which was not forthcoming. The Sardar Mukarram made an abortive attempt to seize the chiid,34 incensed at which the Sagwand attacked and routed him. Later on he succeeded in capturing Hasan and Fazil by treachery, and sent them to Burujird in chains, but the defeat of the Sardar at Khurramabad 2 months later gave them their liberty. Since then misfortune has dogged their footsteps, and no Governor worthy of the name has been appointed, by serving whom they could hope to restore their fortunes. Many of their tribesmen have left them to seek their fortune with the Dirakwand, whose anarchical system with its absence of all demand for revenue, or of obligation to tribal chiefs, appeals strongly to the Lur mind. Lieutenant Lorimer was told in 1904 that the tribe could muster 15,000 souls, 3,000 sowars and 1,500 rifles. Lieutenant Wilson in 1911 was told that the tribe could produce 700 sowars and 1,000 footmen, all armed. The latter figures are today approximately correct as regards men, but not more than 700 rifles could be produced, though there is no doubt that the number of rifles owned by tribesmen has greatly increased. Sagwand pay no revenue, but sometimes send the Governor a present of 10 or 12 mules.36 Sagwand (’All Khdnl ).—• Little is seen of this tribe, who have for many years remained in the hills nea~ Khrrramibad, and in the Abistan plain E. of Kurageh: they a^e mime'ically less strong than the Pap 7 , but more united. They are at enmity with the Rah/m Khini section. Their present chiefs (vide genealogical table on previous page) are Shir Muham mad, Muhammad llusain, Karim and Jehanglr, who is possibly the same as Jihanshlih of the table.

They were once a powerful tribe but have now been much dispersed, and then lands taken by the Kakulwand section of the Dilfan. Zainiwand .— In Pusht-i-Kuh : see Captain Lorimer’s report. Total number of Luristdn tribes. A recapitulation of this doubtless imperfect list of the tribes of Lunstan gives a total of 42,500 fighting men and 12,500 souls. Ifthe population of Khummabad (15,000,) and Burujird (30,000) be added, we have very roughly speaking a total of 50,000 fighting men, and 250,000 souls for Luristan and Burujird. This is almost ex actly the estimated population under the control of the Bakhtiari Khans, vide page 23, volume III, Military Report on S. W. Persia. The estimate corresponds roughly with that of Major Bell, who estimated the Fail! Lurs at 210,000 and the whole population S. of the Ispahan-Burujirddine at 700,000. A million would probably be nearer the mark, if the population of ’Arabistan and Pars be in cluded. Local authorities in Luristan always estimate the numbers much higher, but I am convinced, after much travelling and enquiry, that the above figures are not an under-estimate. Nor must it be imagined that anything like 50,000 men could be put into the field ; the Bairanwand when attacked by the Amir-i-Mufakham in 1911, after full warning of his intention to loot them and secure arrears of revenue, could not put more than 3,000 or 4,000 men in the field, and they had scarcely fired a shot when, on their chief Fazil Khan being killed, they fled precipitately and made no further stand. Their tents were looted, and their women dishonoured shortly after wards, after an attack by a force of not over 2,000 combatants. Lurs differ in no way from the average Persian, in being braggart and cowardly. Putting aside individual cases of bravery, they are, when acting as a tribe, completely selfish, cowardly, and incapable of acting in concert. Fighting value .— Lurs are easily set by the ears. Every succeeding Persian Gov ernor can reckon safely on and rallying to his side, by specious pro mises, presents, and the hope of revenge on some other tribe, a fair proportion of tribal leaders of the province. This done, he plays one against the other, and eventually, when both have been weaken ed, gets his way. The weaker party will not stop to enquire who it is that offers help, or what the ultimate effects will be. Thus the main political combinations make and unmake themselves at the instigation of the Persian Governor. However weak he personally may be, there seems always to be a mysterious respect attached to his dubious friendship, which makes it always possible for him to obtain adherents. But his power for evil has greatly lessened during the past ten years, and he is no longer able, without a strong force, seriously to disturb the even ten our of Luristan politics. Inefficiently organized and deficient in fighting value as are the forces of disorder, yet the forces at the disposal of the Persian Gov ernment are even more unsatisfactory; and to this fact,of which38 competent observers have been convinced by repeated ocular de monstration, must be ascribed its inability to restore order in Luristan and in the other provinces. The Lur is a poor fighting man, but, in his own country, he is at all events the superior of the wretched serf who is forced into mili tary service by the Persian Government, and who form the bulk of their regiments. Unaccustomed to bear arms, and untrained in their use, of a non-fighting class, ill-paid, il'-fed and ill-clothed, it is small wonder that they fly from the enemy at the first opportunity, and are scarcely to be trusted to guard their own camp. The fact, that, up to date (19X1), some measure of success has attended the efforts of the Am'r Mufakham, is due to the employment by him of Bakhtiarl levies, well-paid and well-equipped, and inspired by the hope of plunder, the strongest incentive that can be offered to a Lur. The Amir announced that all plunder taken might be kept, and no “ Order of the Day ” could have stirred their hearts more deeply. An army of 3,000 well-trained men (of whom 1,000 mounted), with a mountain battery, could, I believe, reduce the whole of Luris tan to order within 6 months, and keep it in that condition. It has been held by some writers that Lurs are good material from which to raise regiments officered by Europeans. After a good deal of practical experience of Bakhtiars, and of other Lurs, Lieutenant Wilson recorded his emphatic belief that this was not the case. He did not think that the Lur could ever be relied on to obey orders in time of danger or excitement. Native races, which have never felt the weight of a conqueror’s arm, do not makegood regiments ; they lack the necessary respect for their superiors. la any case they could only be employed in conjunction with an inde pendent force, which could coerce them at any moment, for the Lur is treacherous by nature. They are a people to be avoided as far as possible, but when it is necessary to have dealings with them, enter the lists, if possible with a reserve of physical force in evi dence, which will secure greater practical respect than any diplo matic representations can do.39 C0 ^lKi ^raiaftjj WotW,!! ^ 0 Pportii Tlele, 3 attended entbyiii •spii'ed feyl eoSereitii light he hji hearts n M ffioimtft dole el Li idition, good mateii ans, Afe: )f other Li this was is « relied on; ; races, A: iot mabfi mperm 1 yith an ill ment, foil be avoideis ^swithte force Li »' ananylf^ CHAPTEE IY. Communications. Roads .—The Luristan road was first reported on in detail in 1884 by Major M. S. Bell, V.O., who examined the country with, a view to the construction of a cart road. He classified the Dizrdl- Khurramabad section, from the point of view of cart road construc tion, as follows:— Miles. Good .; ;. .. 57 level; only requires removal of loose boulders. Fair .. .. .. 60 requires to be widened and cleared of stones. Bad .. .. .. 40 requites to be widened and zigzagged in places to lessen gradients, and in places to be blasted. Total .. 157 In 1886 the late Sir G. Mackenzie, who had provisionally open ed the Ahwaz-Ispahan road in 1874, was in negotiation with the Persian Government, with the knowledge and approval of the Foreign Office and India Office, for the construction of a light rail way up the valley of the Diz to Hamadan and Kirmanshah: the proposal however did not mature. In 1890 the Imperial Bank of Persia obtained, amongst other privileges, the Arabistan Route Chaussee Concession, but owing to the disturbed state of the country no steps were taken to open the road. In 1903 the Persian Transport Company was formed to take over the road concessions of the Bank ; which they were on the point of selling to a Persian. Sir George Mackenzie intervened, the sale was prevented, and arrangements were concluded whereby the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company purchased the Bank’s rights, and formed the Persian Transport Company as it now exists. -Jrd of the capital of this Company is held by the Imperial Bank of Persia, who accepted £5,000 in cash, and £10,000 in shares as their price ; and the remainder by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, there being no other share-holders. His Majesty’s Government in this connection contributed £20,000 in cash, for the purpose of assisting the Persian Transport Company to acquire and work these Concessions : this was in lieu of an annual subsidy of £1,000. The Company are at present working the Tehran-Kum-Sultan' abad, and Tehran-Kum-Ispahan roads ; they have also taken over S. S. “Shushan,” a stern-wheeler which plies on the Upper Karun40 between Ahwaz and Shushtar, and they have also acquired such assets and interests as Messrs. Lynch Brothers formerly possessed in the Ahwaz-lspahan (Bakhtiarl) road. Either the Persian Transport Company, or its chief share holder, is thus interested in the alternative trade routes to Central Persia ^.e., Basrah-Baghdad, Ahwaz-Shushtar-Ispahan, and Ahwaz Ispahan, and has thus no strong inducement to press forward with the Luristan project. The Imperial Bank of Persia has obtained from the Persian Government successive postponements of the date by which they were required to have the road in working order; the Persian Transport Company did likewise, and the latest post ponement is to August 1912. If the road be not completed by then, the concession which was originally for 60 years will be annulled. There is some doubt as to whether it is essential to construct a cart road in order to comply with the terms of the concession: it is generally admitted that no great necessity exists for a cart road, and that it can scarcely pay unless worked in combination with a Mohammerah-Dizful railway. What is required is a caravan track; with good serais via the Kialan to Khurramabad and thence to Burujird via Zagheh {vide routes 3 and 8). The cart road, if built, would have to follow route No. 6 via Jaidar Madian Pud and Dureh^as far as Khurramabad, and thence to Burujird vM Zagheh The establishment of a certain degree of order in the province is an essential preliminary to the execution of any such schemes, and it is hoped that the Amir Mufakham, who has already succeeded m establishing his authority in N. Luristan, may before long put us m a position to exercise our rights under the concession. As regards the cart road, the Sardar Akram and notables of Khurram abad have given satisfactory guarantees for the protection of the road within their limits. Sir G. Mackenzie s proposals of 1886 in regard to railway con- structron have been mentioned above; though they did not mature, the British Government in 1890 obtained from the Shah an auto- graph undertaking subsequently confirmed, that in the event of a concession for a railway to Tehran being granted to Russia, a con cession or a Mohammerah-Shushtar-Tehran line should at once be granted to Great Britain. In 1910 Sir G. Mackenzie reverted to e ques ion of this railway, which had in the meantime been the su jec o ex ensive pourparlers with the Russian Government, w o la een anxious to begin negotiations for a Julfa-Mohammerah railway. He was apprehensive that the tendency of Russia would be41 [t ' 3 ^ief ^ ? utes toCeJ in &gt; andlltl ® forwai^ la oltji e ntsofi e | working 0 i| 5 tho latest ps ipletedliyl i he anini instruct a a 'ncession: it oi a cart n )ination i| caravan d and fe e cart roai adianEiit ird eld 2a»i' in tkeproi sncli self! eadysiiccefi efore longf oncessk 1 s of Klim: itection off ) railway® d not mate ial an a!

German influence was likely? moreover, to be a formidable obstacle to British shipping. When the Baghdad rail way had been completed the railway Company could, he said, claim to put an unlimited number of steamers on the Tigris, which would prove the death blow to the position which we have held for so many years. Sir George Mackenzie's sudden death put an end, for the time being, to such representations from those immediately concern ed in our Persian Gulf trade. The question was, however, pursued later on by Sir T. E. Gordon; and Mr. H. F. B. Lynch publicly de clared himself in favour of a line running north from Ahwaz, his idea being, apparently, not to give the line access to the Shatt-al- 'Arab, in order not to prejudice his steamer traffic on the Karun. In February 1911, Mr. C. Greenway, of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, made it known that he was desirous of obtaining a concession for a railway running northwards from Burujird. In March 1911 Lieute nant Wilson was sent, as the outcome of a proposal made in October 1910, to Luristan, to investigate the practical aspects of the railway question. In April 1911 His Majesty's Government with the cog nizance of the Russian Government, put forward a request to the Persian Government for an option to construct a railway from Khor Musa via Ahwaz and Shushtar to Khurramabad. A temporizing, but not entirely unsatisfactory reply was received. Military considerations. This completes our brief survey of the aspects of the communi- cations of Luristan, which directly affect the British Government. It remains to offer a few remarks on the general question of roads in the province, from a military point of view. The route reports which form part of this volume give full details in regard to all routes of importance. Broadly speaking it may be said that west of the Kashgln and between Khurramlbad and Burujird, the roads are already passable for artillery or could be made so with very little difficulty. This portion of Luristan is far less hilly than other parts of the Zagros range : the hills are 'ess steep, and less lofty, the valleys filled by broad p'ains extending for many miles in a N. W. direction, and along these valleys the main tracks run. Successive ridges are pierced by easy passes, and the whole country offers no very serious problem to the road engineer, and is not unsuited on the whole for railway construction. Well watered, generally well-wooded, and with good grazing almost all the year round, Luristan offers not unfavourable conditions foi C 242 GSB42 moving large bodies of troops, as long as supplies can be guaranteed the country being, as a whole, very deficient in stocks of grain and flour. East of the Kashgan the roads are nowhere fit for wheels, and become more and more difficult farther east, but generally speaking loaded mules can be taken anywhere, and in any direction, without serious difficulty. ^ The country is on ti e whole easy to move in, and the passes, by which the roads cross the main ranges, are seldo n such that they could be held and occupied by an enemy for long with success , they could soon be flanked, and there are always seve ral alternative routes. Telegraphs. A telegraph line formerly ran from Dizful to Burujird via Chul Khurramabad and Zagheh, but was so often cut by Lurs that it was at last abandoned: should it be re-erected, it should follow the iiiaJan-Khurramabad-Zagheh route.

The valley of CHAPTER V. 43 P, arese! Saidmarreh is almost as hot as 'Arabistan in summer, and its enemy irj. climate bears a general resemblance to that of the Bakhtiari Garm- lr e always! sIr * Tlie elevations are cooler, and Khurramabad is seldom unpleasantly hot, though swarms of mosquitoes make the evenings burdensome from June onwards. Cypresses grow in its gardens as at Shiraz : this tree is not to be found in any other town of S. rujmhiM W. Persia, I believe, as it cannot withstand very severe cold : iUrstb :: orange trees, however, do not flourish. Snow lies on the Khurram- abad plain for from 20 to 40 days as a rule, but in 1911 it covered u 11 the ground for about 10 weeks. In March the snow line is at about 5,000' in April at 6,000', in May at 7,000'. Only from December to February is there any likelihood of passes being temporarily block ed by snow. The winter season in Luristan is, for those who remain, a time of hibernation. The people remain for 2 months or more in their houses : the cattle are stabled, fodder for 4 or 5 months being col lected during the summer. Wheat is generally sown in the autumn, and only comes up when the snow has melted. Military operations in Upper Luristan are confined to the spring, summer and autumn, not only for climatic reasons, but because in winter the bulk of the tribes go south, and there remains no one to coerce.44 CHAPTER VI. Strategical considerations. For reasons given under this heading in Volume III of this Re port, it seems unnecessary to discuss the position of Luristan in the event of an Anglo-Russian conflict. The interest, to us, of this prov ince, lies in the fact that the shortest route from the Gulf to Tehran traverses it, and that in event of troubles occurring in Kirmanshah Hamadan or Tehran, necessitating the despatch of troops to Persia this route, if open, would be preferable to any other in point of time! But several facts militate against its use : it is liable to be closed b .y snow : years may elapse before caravanserais and regular sup plies are made available, and in winter the Khurramabad-Hamadan or Khurramabad-Kirm mshah section would be most severe on man and beast. Nor can the turbulent nature of the tribes be wholly ignored, though they are unlikely to offer serious opposition to even small bodies of disciplined troops. On the whole, therefore, this road should be avoided for military purposes. The general remarks under this heading m Volume III of this Report, apply equally to Luristan, and should be read in conjunction with this Chapter. *45 CHAPTER VII. Hints to travellers in Luristan, by Lieutenant Wilson, lelll of|: I. A., Political Department. 0 us, 0 f£ The following remarks which apply to all the provinces of S. W. e Gulf to | Persia, are the result of several years’ travelling amongst Lurs and in KiimjU' Arabs, but they are no more than suggestions, as every individual troops tof, has his own requirements and tastes. point Travelling in Luristan without some previous knowledge of able to ted the country and language is undesirable , and a traveller under such ail( lrepla[ ; circumstances cannot hope to obtain full or reliable information. la batHaif Servants taken should be Persians. Tentage and equipment should s Levereo|! p e reduced to the smallest proportions: a large caravan excites tribestei no respect, only avarice. I myself use a sowar’s pal for myself, opositioutn and another for servants : camp bed, despatch box, canvas bath, !, therefore,; gladstone bag, and 2 yakdans : despatch box serves as seat, bed as generalr® table, or one may sit on the ground, and use despatch box or yakdan ipplj eepl as a table. Large tents are a nuisance, and the climate is not hot ibis Chaptet enough to render them a necessity. Presents for chiefs should be carried by all travellers. Lurs and others who require presents or bribes may be divided into 2 classes, those who prefer cash, and those who prefer presents. The former are in the majority, and therefore knives, cheap revolvers, etc., are of little use, it is cheaper to give cash. The bigger chiefs, whose dignity will not allow them to accept cash, always want telescopes (but good ones, and not binoculars), gold watches with chain, not necessarily 18 carat. Mauser repeating revolvers or other good automatic patterns are very popular, and not too bulky to carry. Rifles are of course welcome but they are awk ward to carry, and their existence once known, the avarice of the Lur makes them a burden to the traveller. If presents are given at all, such articles as those mentioned above should be given, for Lur chiefs have a'very high opinion of their position, and silver watches, hunting knives, etc., are no good whatever. A few medicines should be carried : purgatives are in great demand, chlorodyne, tinc ture of opium, potassium permangnate, and quinine should always be in hand. Servants should be decently dressed, as the status of a visitor is largely deduced from the appearance which he and his servants present. For this reason a good suit of clothes grey tail coat), if possible, should be carried. A good horse is of course very pleasant to ride, and adds to the traveller’s prestige, but its feed and keep are a nui sance : a decent pack horse can generally be hired along with mules* and the muleteer is then responsible for jt. These horses thrive on46 grazing only, and are marvellously sure footed on the hills, thus greatly adding to the rider's comfort. A reserve supply of flour and rice for servants and muleteers should be taken, whatever may be said to the contrary; it is difficult if not impossible, to get a regular supply of good bread from nomads’ who only have just enough flour for themselves, and eke it out with barley corns and millet. Of other stores the less carried the better Kam is almost unknown from early in May till the end of October.’ If the traveller has to make a survey, and ascend hills for the purpose’ and stop here and there on the route at inconvenient points, he must make up his mind to do whatever he wishes, disregarding totally all protests by Lurs, who will endeavour to dissuade him by stories of hostile tribes occupying the hill in question, and suggest that the as cent be made the next day, which is equivalent to a postponement to the Greek Kalends. It is_ no good attempting to conceal one’s motives, or causing one s native surveyor, if one be attached to the party, to masquerade as a cook or servant. By announcing frankly one s object and intention suspicion is amply disarmed, and almost all Lurs will readily afford any information in their power to give They do not really object to maps being made, but do their g best by protests and excuses to prevent the traveller from climbin* un necessary hills, as they do not want the trouble of providing an es- labour^ ^ ^ 136 ^ Ue3e33lfcy of such ^P^ently gratuitous47 conceal oi Mieitol mcingbi i nnd alts lower to gift io tleir k; climliingi. aiding Me. dy grataite CHAPTER VIII. Notes on Notables op Luristan (excluding Pusht-i-Kuh). Nazar ’’Ali Khan (Fath-es-Sultan), (Fath-i-Laslikar), Sardar Akram, Wall of Plsh-i-Kuh (1910) ; of the Amrai tribe, Chief of the Dilfan confederacy, exercises much influence over the Silsileh and to some extent also over the Bairanwand: for a description of his appearance vide Chapter III. He is a self-made man, and commenc ed his upward career by stealing a horse, then a rifle, then some money, with which he collected a band of fellow-thieves, who by their daring and successful raids soon enriched themselves at the expense of their neighbours. Before long he had some 200 men attached to him, and commenced to harry Qasim Khan, Amir-i-Panj, then head of the tribe, with such effect, that the latter was glad to capitulate, and give him a share in the management and revenues of the tribes. On Qasim Khan’s death he established himself in his present posi tion, and though he has suffered many vicissitudes of fortune, no Governor has succeeded in dislodging him. He is a typical Lur, up to any villainy, and in consequence commands the respect of his men. He has recently built a fort at Pa Astun near Tarhan, and shows signs of desiring to settle down to a peaceful existence, if he can do so without paying more than the minimum of revenue. Friendly to Europeans, and said to be more trustworthy than most Lurs, but this is not saying much. Habibulldh Khan. Diwan Begi, “ Walizadeh ”, a permanent resident of Khurramabad: Deputy Governor, 1911. His brother Saifullah Khan, is a fine looking able young man, with a great repu tation for bravery. Habibullah himself has suffered many vicissi tudes, having once been within a few hours of being blown from a gun by Muzaffar-ul-Mulk, until ransomed. He is a typical Lur, though he has acquired some manners by intercourse with Per sian Governors. Quite unreliable, in Lieutenant Wilson’s opinion, and with little influence beyond that which his official position gives him. His father’s name was Mahm~d Salih Khan. He is closely associated with the Chaqarwand family (vide infra), and could scarcely retain his position without their favour. Aghd-Rabbiyd, Chaqarwand. Son of a merchant, Hajl ’Iwaz, a man of gome standing in Luristan and fairly trustworthy: in telligent generally acts as the Sardar Akram’s agent in negotia tions with Persian Governors.

Burujird—S^OW (Wilson). 5,400' (De Morgan.) % The chief town of a thickly populated province of the same name, ruled by a Deputy Governor appointed by the Central Gov ernment, and generally under the superintendence of the Governor- General of Luristan. Post Office .—Weekly mails to Daulatabad and Khurramabad. Telegraph office connected with Daulatabad. Situated at the head of the fertile STakhur valley. De Morgan calls the Sllakhur river the Sailabkhur, and gives it the alternative name of Lakor-Rud, and says that local legend asserts the valley to have once been a lake, which was suddenly emptied. The alluvial formation of the valley, its flatness, and marshiness in places, indi cate that the legend is not without justification, though the empty ing of the lake was attributed to Muhammad, who cut the mountains with his sword, forming the Tang-i-Bahrain, at the mouth of which stands a ruined mud fort, where the Ab-i-Burujird and the Kamand Ab join. The plain is covered with very ancient mounds from which antiquities are occasionally unearthed. To the S. W. and E. of Burnjird the hills are of limestone: to the N. the hills are round and of medium height, formed of decomposed granites; the valleys, once very deep, are now filled with alluvium, only here and there are veins of intrusive rocks to be observed, which have resisted the effect of the weather. Mention has already been made in Chap ter I of the mineral deposits supposed to exist near Burhjird. . climate of Buriijird is very cold in winter, and temperate in summer, thanks to the proximity of the great ranges of ^' u y ls ^ n * -^ e Morgan states tint the latter attract moisture, and that 15 days rarely elapse without heavy rainstorms, of a few hours’ duration, occurring near the town. This was not borne out, however, by Lieutenant Wilson’s own experience. Cereals, poppy,^ cotton, and tobacco are grown with success and all kinds of fruit trees flourish. The cold is too great how ever for cypress or orange trees.49 e of tie | $ &gt; Central^ tlo Gove® Kkmi| • De li| tk altemt ^ tie valji Tie alii n places,! gl tie eme: tlemoaat outlofii 1 tie Kai \t. and: , tie Ills granites;! onlylere»i iaveresl lade inOl [irijiri nd temp® it ranges i act moist® ms, ofafe ft-ikon’s ktl sics great to There is practically no wood, except that grown in the gardens. Poplar and planes are grown to furnish bee ms for building. There is no lack of fish in the rivers: reptiles are uncommon, and those that are met with are seldom venomous. Population. Mainly Persian, but the vil'agers are a mixed race of Lur, Kurd and Persian descent, speaking a corrupt dialect, in which all the above elements are represented, though Persian predominates. They are a poor type, so destitute of spirit as to be unable to resist the exactions either of their Lur neighbours or the Peisian Government; quarrelsome vith each other to such a degree that Lr.rs, as they well know, can generally loot one village in the certainty that inhabitants of other villages will not interfere. Jew and Armenian settlements are found, the former in the towns only, and the latter mainly in isolated villages. They have retained their religion and national traits, and live on good terms with their Muhammadan neighbours, whom they rival as thieves and robbers. Armenians are more respected by Muhammadans than Jews. De Morgan puts the population of the town at 20,000, Lieutenant Wilson was inclined to put it at 30,000. In 1890 a per- mament garrison of infantry and artillery existed, but this is no longer the case. Industries .— Soapmaking, wine pressing (Jews), working in nic kel, brass and copper (particularly Samavars). Hulaildn, 3,600'. (Williams 1907). A tract of country 35 to 40 miles S. of Kirmanshah, bounded on the E. by Luristan (Pusht-i-Kuh): on the N. by the small district of Harsin (the actual dividing line being at a point known as a Pil- 1 hkau): on the W. by the Bijawand (?) : to the N. E. it touches Kuh- i-Zardilan: to the S. and E. it is bounded by the low range of hills on which is the Im'mz. Shah Muhammad. Lieutenant Williams, I. A. (A. Y. D) describes it as follows—“ This country is supposed to “have the best soil, and the best grazing in all S. W. Persia: I personally never imagined I should ever see anything like it: it “ has natural grazing of the best, in places over 2 in height: all the “ hillsides are covered with it, also the Hulailan plain ; in ordinary years the whole district contains some three thousand tents inhabit- “ ed by Shirwani, Saiyidun and others.” Rabino gives its inhabit ants as Dap wand 300 families, Balawand 3o0 faxnilies, Surkh- miri 200 families, Osmanawand 500, Jalalawand 500 (in winter only), and herdsmen of various tribes who repair here in winter and pay for grazing rights. Lutf ’Ali Khani, Lurwand and Kaush- wand are also mentioned as inhabitants. S242 GSB50 Revenue. —-Maliyat of Hnlailan krans 26,220, all in cash.

Route to Hulailan from Kirmdnshdh via Sarab, Dum-i-Shamsheh, Sarvbanat (3 farsakhs) Ab-i-Marik, Daramrud, Qarawaneh, Khalilan (5b farskhs). This pass (gaduk) is rather difficult. Thence through Tang-i-Safarkhan (Osmanawand), Tang-i-Sau Rustam, Ab-i-Jazmin (Osmanawand-Jalalawand boundary). Thence Tang-i-Tash-i-Kabud (Tashko), Kaleh Kahareh, (above on authority of Rabino). Ownership. Hulailan is really part of Kirmanshah: Lieut enant Williams gives the following account of its ownership : “ By the last decree of the Shah, Hulailan belongs to ’Ali Riza Khan, “ brother of Wall of Pusht-i-Kuh, but the latter has seized all rights, “ and derives all benefits therefrom, and there is nobody sufficiently “strong enough to gainsay him. 'AliRiza Khan being unable to “ derive benefit from his own land, does his best to annoy his brother, “the Wall, by continually inciting Nazar 'All Khan to harass the “country. “ The country of Hulailan is considered, and very rightly so, the “ most prized possession of all this part of Persia, and properly taken “ in hand, it would no doubt yield an enormous revenue. It is worth “ recording the histry of the place, because legally it does not belong “to Alf Riza Khan.” “About 17 years ago, Hulailan belonged to As’adullah Khan, “ Imam-i-Juma of Kirmanshah, and the Sardar Afkham, jointly. “ The Imam-i-Juma sold it to Hussain Quli Khan, Abu Qadareh “ the Wall of Pusht-i-Kuh, for 10,000 tumans : but this was “ done without the knowledge or consent of the Sardar Afkham, who “ moreover never even received his rightful share. Therefore in “ the first instance the transaction itself was not legal. The Sardar “ could get no redress.” “On the death of Hussain Quli Khan the country was left to “’Ali Riza Khan, the younger brother of the present Wali of Pusht- “ i-Kuh. The Wali, however, by paying 10,000 tumans to the Shah, “ (this is about 4 years ago), had Hulailan assigned to him, and an order to this effect was issued by Government accordingly. 'Ali Riza Khan, not to be done out of it, then paid the Farman “Farma 10,000 tumans and through his influence got the last order “ cancelled and a fresh order issued by the Shah reassigning Hnlailan “ to him ('Ali Riza Khan).”51 being mi; moytisk; intoku frigiyi! properly te ne, Itisi does not kl: ’aduMSi fkhain, joii , Abiip but til ,r Attain, t Tlierefe 1.

It goes without saying that All “Biza Khan has gradually lost all hold over the land, and does not “ receive anything at all now. “The question is—does Hulailan belong to its present nominal “owner? In the first instance the Imam-i-Juma could not sell “without the full consent of the joh.t owner, Sardar Afkham, and “therefore that transaction was itself entirely void. Th s seems “to me to be rather animportant question, as the Sardar Aikham “and his family are British subjects. Jdidar 2,000' (Wilson). A fine undulating plain also known as Chul-i-Jaidar at the foot oftheWaleh and Dal ch mountains, just S. of Tang-i-Khirsdar, through which the Ab-i-Kashgan emerges on to the plain on its way to join the Saidmarreh. Claimed by Hassanwand, but cultivated for some years past onlv by Judeki: no permanent inhabitants. Schindler (1877) thought this plain to be the site of the ancient city of Shapur Khast. Khurramdbdd 4,400' (Wilson). 4,200' (Bell). ^ The capital of Luristan is assessed (with the Chig'ni) at 10,000 tumans in cash and kind: Post Office with weekly mails to Ind from Burajird, and fortnightly to and from DirfuL A Dizful- Khurramibad telegraph line existed at one time, but it was de stroyed a very short time after its erection. The prm ipal market of Luristan, but its bazar is poorly furnished. Population : according to De Morgan 5,000. I should now estimate it at 10,000 at least : ruled by a Deputy Governor armointed by the Governor-General of Luristan. The town lies the head of a gorge, through which a mountain stream emerges or, to the Kurageh plain: it is commanded by the hills on 3 sides, aid is of no military strength. In the centre of the valley, and m the midst of the town, i^ a small rocky ridge on which has been erected a fort, originally Arab, and enlarged by Persians. At its foot lie the Government House gardens, which can boast of the charms of old cypress trees and running water. Though rfton attacked by nomads, Khurramabad has never been sacked: its inhabitants are well armed and never fail to offer a stout resistence. The environs are well cultivated, and fine52 gardens abound, though much spoiled by Lurs of recent years. Ihe Dizful road having been closed for many years, everything is very costly, 100 % and 200 % more so than in Dizful. Khurrannbad bas been occupied from ancient times and extensive ruins lie S. E. of the town ; Chaldtean cylinders have been found, and Sassanian coins in large numbers. When the Arabs replaced tbe Sassanians, they made Khurramabad a centre for the propagation of their religious tenets; they improved the old trade routes, and built bridges and serais; to their efforts, when established at Khurramabad, must be attributed the fine bridges over the Kashgan. The most notable ruin is the “ Minar ”, a circular brick tower 60' high with a Kufic inscription round the top. Lurs say that a great stone was once in the pillar, likewise inscribed, and that a European came and blew it up; round it are numerous ruins. The town lies on the right bank of the river, but the old town now \ in ruins is on the left bank. A bridge now broken crosses the river 11 miles S. of the town, leading to the old town. The present bridge was built by ’Ali Mardan Khan in the 9th century and was repaired by Muzaffar-ul-Mulk. Breadth of roadway 18' ; length 300 yards. On the road side, not far from the Minar, is a nearly square monolith, said to rest on a truncated pyramid 8' high: the monolith measures 6' X7J' X 9', and is covered by Kufic writings, now largely defaced I by an inscription, setting forth the acts of Muzaffar-ul-Mulk as Governor of Luristan under the Zill-es-Sultan. The Kufic inscrip tions that remain seem never to have been translated. feet in ^ jjefante hWen • Hawlinso quite an 1 jtntigonu tlemoui stricture ture ex bridges. The Khurramabad district is said formerly to have been called Samba.

A broad alluvial plain, often highly cultivated, but not irrigated to any extent: several ancient mounds are to be found in the middle of-the plain: the largest is known as Zakheh. Mr. DeMorgan (page 208), considers it, from fragments of pottery he bas found there, to be one of the most ancient of Elamitic sites, and believes it to be the Dur Undasi of the inscriptions of Assur-Banipal, whence he fled to Khaidalu (Khurramabad) after the battle ne fought on the banks of the Saidmarreh at Madaktu (Dar-i-Shahr). It is cultivated by tribes under tbe Sardar Akram. Pul i-Tang. 1,300' (Wilson). A bridge across the Saidmarreh river a few miles above its junc tion with Ab-i-Zal. The river here runs in a narrow chasm some 1253 feet in breadth and 50' or 60' (not 150') deep, the sides of which tn llr ^ ; are fantastically honey-combed b^ the action of the water, which has , worn this bed for itself.

The Commerce of Luristan. The principal products of Luristan in point of value, is probably mules, which this province produces in greater numbers and of finer quality perhaps, than any other part of Persia. ^ The Sagwand, who were once the chief breeders, have diminished m numbers, and for the most part remain in Arabistan ; they now own but few mules. The Dirakwand own a few, perhaps 500 all told, of which few are for sale. The Bairanwand are now the principal owners and breeders: Lieutenant Williams in 1907 reported that 3,000 could be obtained annually from this tribe alone ; The Kakawand also own many, but a purchasing officer finds it difficult to have dealings with this tribe, as many of its animals are notoriously stolen property. Wool, ghl and skins come next in importance. Khurramabad was formerly the chief market, but the difficulties attending transport from Khurramabad to the outer world has killed its trade: Burujird and Dizfu.1 are now the chief marts. Gum tragacanih and gaz are collected: the latter to a very small extent; the former used to be largely exported, but the pro duction has fallen off. Oak bark, galls, and oak leaves, for tanning purposes are also exported, as well as charcoal and firewood. Oil shows in Luristdn. (1) Qllab.

Q dab is watered by the Ab- i- Mungarreh emerging from the Tang-i-Zardawar, and by the Ab-i-Anaraki which unite to form the Bala Rud.

The Road is difficult throughout: see route 4 : the Klalan pass is the worst on the route, but could easily be improved : bad as it is, it is preferred by caravans and nomads ; it has commended itself to the common sense of previous road makers, and has already been used as a caravan track. A considerable amount of labour has been spent on making it practicable : at one time the stages were marked by sarais, but these have suffered destruction. It is the most direct of all the practicable routes. Climate. —See Military Report. The passes are occasionally blocked by snow for a few weeks at a time. Supplies. —Nil.

Also reported on by Bell in March 1884; Con- ingh&amp;m 1889 ; Preece 1895. Epitome. General .—The easiest route from Dizful to Burujird, but for some years has been closed owing to anarchy and used only by nomads in their annual migrations. The Baharwand (DIrakwand) and Kurd ’Aliwand (Dirakwand) use this route, or else No. 3, which latter is used by the Mirs (Dirakwand). The road from Salihabad to near Kaleh Riza passes through Qalawand territory, (as far as Salihabad it is under Sagwand control) ; thence to Dum-i-Chul the country belongs to Bah wand or Kurd ’Aliwand ; thence to Shah-in-Shah the land is claimed by the Hasanwand, who have now been replaced by the Judeki, who are in possession. The Mirs and Baharwand, with the Judeki all claim a share in the bdj or money levied from caravans using the road. Total distance. —One hundred and fifty-three m. in 11 stages. The Road .—Colonel Bell in 1884 classed it as follows with reference to cart road construction : 57 m. good and level, merely requiring removal of loose boulders : 60 m. fair, requiring to be widened and cleared of stone, 40 m. bad, re uiring to be widened and zigzagged in places to lessen the gradients. He estimated the cost as follows 57 m. @ Rs. 20 .. 60 m. @ Rs. 100 40 m. @ Rs. 500 Lieutenant Wilson considered it very much more difficult, incapable of being made into a cart road except at a cost of some £ 10 , 000 , independently of political and tribal obstacles, which alone are almost prohibitive, and the unLkel hood of the traffic ever gufficing to pay even the interest on the sums expended. Climate .—Very hot in summer as far as Dum-i-Chul, the heat to this point being scarcely less than in the ’Arabistan plain. In winter the road is covered with snow in places, but not impassable for long, though bitterly cold. Heavy rains or snow ^11 from November to April, probably about 20 inches per annum. Supplies. —Nil, except from nomad tribes, who, however, cannot, as a rule, supply b£pdey ,/&gt; 1 spare more than enough bread to last a small party for a few days.

Ab-i-Lailum and Ab-i-Fani are bitter in summer, and good water is not obtainable after June at Dum-i-Chul except in very small quantities from springs at the foot of the limestone hill Do Farush (=Klalan). Fuel .—Very scarce as far as Badamak, plentiful afterwards ; sufficient for a small party, can always be obtained at Chul. A little charcoal should be carried as a reserve.

At 4 m. the Ab-i-Zal is crossed by single brick bridge of 20'’ span, built in 1890 by Muzaffarml-Mulk. One parapet fell in 1911, and the bridge needs repairs ; position of bridge indicated by 2 stone and gach pillars on either side. Bridge is in a ravine, which is 60' deep, and is itself about 30' above river. Approaches stony and bad on either side : fords above and below bridge are difficult. Remains of several bridges are visible close to present site ; the rums of a high level bridge (or aqueduct) are to be seen 2 m. above present bridge. Track now crosses stony slopes till 5 m., when gypsum hills are entered. At 7 m. reaches stony valley of Tirada (Theodor or Thunder of old maps) ? camping ground on E. bank is known as Qabr- i-Qasim, on W. side Qafilajah. The remains of a graded track are visible on either side of the stream. The Ab-i-Tnadl rises in slopes of Kuh Suwaran and pierces Kuh Rustam Dau by Tang-i-Gunjab : at 1 m. above Qafilajah are ruins of no interest known as Shahr-i-Gaud. The old graded track crossed Tirada stream, where t flows through a ravine only 10' broad at top, by a wooden bridge. Remains of a high level bridge or aqueduct with 5 pillars is visible 1 m. down stream. From Qafilajah a track diverges N.

From Qafilajah, Route No. 3 dieverges over Kialan to Ab-i-Sard. At 8 miles cross gypsum ridge and descend to valley of Dar-i-Zarab, ascending a similar ridge qn opposite side : traces of well graded road visible here. At 9 miles pass Ab-i-Kaj-i-Pushkeh : road very bad amongst gypsum hills. (M.—There is a road 1 m. N. of, and parallel to, the one here described reported to be a good deal easier.) At 11 m. reach Ab-i-Darreh Khazineh from gypsum hills. At this point descend to river level into Cham-i-Gardib, ascending up steep slope at 12 m. Pul-i-Tang here lies 1 m. due S.

W. of it known as the DalTch Kuchik : the former is the best: both are difficult and stony: the descent is somewhat easier over limestone slopes to the Ab-h Sard valley: a few ruins scarcely noticeable mark the remains of the Post House or sarai. The plain is marshy : to the E, it is fairly open, full of low hills of gypsum and red clay, to the W. it is obstructed by high limestone, sandstone and gypsum belts.

Three m. above its junction with the Chimashk stream, it passes through Tang-i-Bawileh (5,700'): here are some remarkable caves cut in the solid limestone rock (strata here vertical) and only approach able with great difficulty. There are three stories all connected with each other by difficult ledges 12 ' high: the upper story contains the remains of a gach dome and a ruined partition wall. Traces of recent habitation by Lurs, and by wild animals. This track is an easier one than that via Nal Shikandeh, and can be recommended as an alternative. It rejoins the main track at the S. foot of Kuh-i-BawwI. The main road crosses Raikhan stream or else the Kabgan stream beyond the gorge and winds up the Raikhan valley, which is cultivated and fairly open.

At 2 m. cross valley ofTaiyil, a stream in a deep valley (5,390'): at 5 m. the Shurab stream is crossed in a deep valley (4,700'). The road now winds up a tributary stream with undulations, ground stony and bad going. At 8 m. summit of Kuh-i-BawwI is reached, from which there is a difficult descent over boulders to the bottom of the valley N • to Khurramabad : the road to Shah-in-Shah keeps along the top of the hill and is easier but about 2 miles longer. At 11 m. the road leaves the ravine and crossing a rapid brook descends into the plain (4,100'). Shah-in-Shah itself is on a low spur above the plain and is distinguished by a white dome from which Khurramabad bears 32°. A few houses, but no supplies can be reckoned on : grazing good, water from stream. An alternative route to Khurramabad from Dadabad is shown on the map ; it runs up the Shurab stream,which is 6,000' where the track touches it, for 3 m. to the Tang-i- Jamal-i-Kal (in which are the ruins of an ancient fort) and then turning north again ascends the Kuh-i-Bawwi by an easy valley track to Qalb-’Ali Khani, whence a track leads (near Ab-i-Siwak) direct to the plains below : the descents on the track are difficult, but it seema shorter, and the Ab-i-Taiyil is avoided altogether.

The track could be converted to wheeled traffic more easily than any other ; water and grazing throughout at convenient points ; fuel generally available ; supplies more easily obtainable after the Kashgan has been crossed, than on any other route. Total distance. —154 miles. The road.—The nature of the hills favours the construction of a cart road with gentle gradients : rock cutting required would be small: the road is never impassable on account of snow, as are the routes E. of the Kashgan which traverse heights of 7,000 : by removing stones and boulders, and widening it here and there, the road could be fitted for carts rapidly and easily. Climate. —Very hot in summer in ’Arabistan plain: bitterly cold in winter in Luristan and snow covers ground for as much as a month at a time above 4,000 , though not enough to impede traffic seriously. Supplies.—Nil, except from nomads at present, but if road were opened and sarais built, supplies would be obtainable at every stage from Madian Rud onwards from tribes permanently domiciled in vicinity. Physical obstacles. —Dizful to Jaidar. See Route No. 4. Pul-i-Kurr-o-Dakhtar {Tang-i-Khirsdar). —This gorge can be entered at present only on foot from the S. on either bank, and even then with difficulty, unless the river is ford able, in which case loaded mules can enter. A good deal of blasting is necessary to make a mule track, still more for a cart track. Kdshgdn river. —This has to be crossed at Pul-i-Kurr-o-Dukhtar and again near Dureh : it is unfordable for at least 4 months in the year and for 3 or 4, more difficult to ford: it must certainly be bridged if a commercial mule or cart road is to cross it. Average breadth of bridge say 120' double span. Timber available at Khurramabad, could be floated down river to Pul i Kurr o Dukhtar. A good temporary structure might be made by trestles of railway iron supporting roadway of local timber covered with brushwood. Trestles anchored to bank by chains, C 242 GSB66 Route No. 6.— contd. Mdd'idn Rud has to be crossed once ; little water but very muddy bottom : bridge exists, but in bad repair : fit for mules but not for wheeled traffic : breadth of water about 12 feet: bridge consists of 2 small culverts about 4 ' span.

DIZFCTL-PA-I-PUL-I-KARKHEH-iB-I-DANAN-SAIDMARREH- GULGUL-TANG-I-GURAZ-KHTJRRAMABAD. Authorities and dates. —Lorimer, 1904 ; Wilson, (part) 1911. Epitome. This route has frequently been used by caravans in the past owing to the impasa- ability of the routes up the Saidmarreh valley. On leaving ’Arabistan at Pa-i-Pul-i* Karkheh it enters Pusht-i-Kuh territory, in which it runs till the crest of the Kabir Kuh is crossed at any one of several points : thence to the Saidmarreh river the country is occupied by the Zainiwand under Mir Said Muhammad Khan, a subject of the Wall but to some extent under the influence of the Sardar Akram. Thence to Khurramabad it runs through territory controlled as far as the Kashgan directly and from the Kashgan to the towns indirectly, by Nazar ’AH Khan, Sardar Akram. Total distance 173 miles in 70 stages. The road. —Fairly good throughout, better probably than any other track in Luristan; needs clearing of stones. Snow falls lightly over the portions above 4,000' but not enough to block traffic for more than a day or two. The heat in summer would render it advisable for caravans to move S. of the Kabir Kuh by night as a rule. Supplies. — Nil, except from nomad tribes, as far as Saidmarreh : from this point on wards, if sarais were erected, supplies of fodder, etc., would readily be available; nomads are always in vicinity of road, and supplies always obtainable. Water and Grazing. —Plentiful throughout. Fuel scanty S. of Kabir Kuh, but always available thence forward to Khurramabad, Physical obstacles. Crossing of Aabir^w^ (about 5,000') Captain Lorimer writes :—“ In the ascent of the Kabir Kuh there is a short difficult space.” Passage of Karkheh. —There are several fords all alike passable for mules, only in the autumn, even then the water reaches the loads. The best point for a bridge is near the old Sassanian one at Pa-i-Pul, which might perhaps be utilized. Passage of Saidmarreh. —Passable with safety only from July to November by mules. Passage of Kdshgdn. —Passable with safety only from July to November by mules minimum breadth 80' average 120'; depth in June 4' in October 2%' (Burton) ; pebbly bottom, easy gradient in and out. Temporary structures, of railway iron trestles and wooden road bearers would, I think, suffice to span all the above : wood (oak) up to 12 ' in length available locally, and pop lars in Khurramabad. Wood for the Karkheh could be brought from Mohammerah up the Diz. Alternative stages and routes. —A more westerly route between Rumishgan and Diireh is sometimes used via Qatarchi, Gulgul, Komir, Tang-i-Gnraz and Sumaq, but it is more difficult than that proposed below. There are numerous points along the route which might be used as camping grounds for caravans desiring to make longer or shorter mar lies than those here proposed.69 Boute No. 7.— contd. MABREH. ).

Distance 184 miles. Authortiy and date.—Burton, September 1897. Epitome. General. —This road may conveniently be divided into 2 sections : (1) The part traversing the mountainous tract from Deh Bala to where it emerges on to the Tigris plain at Kalata (stage 8) is lOOf miles in length. (2) The part followin'* the Tigris plain to the Karkhah river, which it crosses at Dizful and which is 84 miles long. ° For this part compare also the Route from Dizful to Kut-ul-Amarah, alternative (A) which is practically the same route as this. Total distance.—184: miles in 13 stages. Road.—In section (1) the road traverses the intricate hills lying between the wall-like range of the Kab r Kah and the Tigris plain. The road is in parts very narrow and steep and is itnpassable for artillery. This part of the road is most easily traversed from March to June inclusive. Then forage is most abundant, the crops standing or just reaped, and the tribes with their flocks and herds are camped adjacent to the tracts traversed by the road. During the autumn forage is less plentiful and the tribes move to remoter valleys . From November to March the country is mainly deserted, the tribes migrating to the Tigris plain In Section 2 the road traverses an almost level plain and is practicable for all arms on any breadth of front. The Tigris plain from Kalat i to the Karkheh R. is, however only practicable for troops from October to March. During the rest of the year it is almost deserted. In October the tribes of Pusht-i-Kuh descend from the mountains brino-int* with them large flocks and herds. The Indian corn is then ripe and the desert always°provides a certain quantity of grass. In February the approach of spring provides the most luxuriant herbage which dries with the first heat of April and May, during wihich months the tribes migrate to the hill country. It is app irent, therefore, that this section is traversable by troops in winter and spring only. In the winter the direct road from Kalati to Deh Bala Section 2 , should not be attempted, but the level road to Z .rbatieh, (Route No. 16) should be followed. ' Supplies.—1. The crops of wheat and barley are green in April, and r : pen durina May to July, according to elevation. From Arkaw iz ( 2 ) to the Mima river, stages 5 to 8 , culti vated lands are adjacent to the road. The autumn crop of Indian corn is scanty a'nd in sufficient for the supply of a force of any size. From April to October vast numbers of sheep and goats and some cattle are pastured. In the earlier months they are on the lower levels near the road, and in the autumn recede to the remoter valleys and higher elevations. 5 2 . Vide “ Road ” above. In no case should infantry endeavour to follow this section of the route until arrangements for supplies be made with the tribes, and the Willi of Pusht- i-Kuh ; unless accompanied by cavalry, whose services would be absolutely necessary for foraging.

Suitable for mule and donkey transport only. Guns can pass as far as Hus- sainiyeh (4) and Zailan to Kirmanshah, stage 11 . Donkeys seem to be the transport most used by natives on the route. From Hussainiyeh (4) to Zailan ( 10 ) a succession of very difficult defiles and passes are encountered. In the spring when the rivers are in floods, this road must be closed in several places. Supplies.—Some supplies are usually available in most stages except stages 5 and 6 but probably not in any quantity. H ater. At all stages, but often brackish though drinkable, especially in the first five stages from Kut-al-Amarah to Chlni Malik.87 Route No. 13.— contd. Fuel .—Obtainable in the hills, but generally scarce at the halting places. Climate .—In the hills is pleasant about August whi h is the hottest time of the year. Towards the end of October it begins to rain ; the rainy season lasts a month. Then snow sets in and remains on the ground for 2| to 3 months. The tops of the Manisht Kuh and the Gacha Kuh are covered with snow as late as April, but it does not remain all the year round. Alternative stages .—Th ‘se are said to be the only ones usually followed by the local caravans. They appear to be as difficult as the main stages given. The length is practi cally the same. Kut-al-Amirah is a town of about 1,200 houses with a population of 4,000, built chiefly of sun-dried bricks. There is a Turkish customs house, telegraph office, and a con siderable number of gardens and some wheat and cultivation, a caravanserai, mosque hummaras and a well-stocked bazar. Elevation 98'.

Ford the river at the bottom, 80 yards wide and 18' to 2 ' deep with a rapid stream in a pebbly channel. Then a steep ascent of 200' out of the river-bed by a series of short zigzags over loose stones. Reach a flat terrace between the border hills. Gorge of the river lies 200 yards to the right. Stony track, rough going. Cross 3 dry ravines and one down by a rou&lt;di descent for a short distance over large round stones and masses of gravelly con glomerate. Then by the right bank of the Kunjlan Cham river to Hussainiyeh. The river here flows in a gorge 30' to 40' broad, and 50' to 60' deep with steep cliffs on either side. This stage is passable for guns up to 7f miles. After that artillery cannot pass, though the road is a good track for laden animals. In spring time a route is followed which avoids crossing the river as far as possible. In the autumn and the hot weather, when the river is low, the most direct route is taken. Hussainiyeh consists of two forts belonging to tho Wall of Pusht-i-Kuh and forming his winter residence ; the lower fort is on the right bank of the river ; the other is W. of it on the higher ground, 200 yards away. Both are com pletely commanded within close rifle range by hills on the S.-E. and W. sides. Troops can camp on the low hills on the right bank of the stream, ground uneven and stony. Water, plentiful from the river, is quite drinkable. Firewood scarce, only some scat tered bushes about. KhaSa ’Ali. . 161 93 Gen. direction E. of N.

From Gulgul the road descends the valley of Saidmarreh river and is more difficult, traversing passes barely practicable for laden animals. On reaching Rudbar ( 7 ) the Saidmarrah river must be forded; it is practicable for laden animals only from July to November. From Rudbar to the junction with Route No. 16 the Kirmlnshah-Kut- al-Amarah route, the road is good with the exception of the section up the Zangawan valley, stage 10, and is easily improvable to a state traversable by artillery. The spring is indicated as the best season for the passage of the troops. Cavalry could traverse this route with ease and rapidity owing to the abundance of forage. Supplies .—Until Madian Rud (4) is reached, inhabitants are scarce; and supplies are almost non-existent for this portion of the road, some 50 m. from Khurramabad. From Madian Rud to Gulgul (5) camps are frequent and large flocks are usually visible from some portion of the route. After Rudbar (7) to the junction with Route No. 16 supplies are procurable.

Authority and (fate.—Burton , August 1897 ; Wilson, (part) May 1911. Epitome. General. —This road may conveniently be divided into 2 sections:— I. That lying within the Kirmanshah jurisdiction to the head of the Harsin valley at the Gashur pass in stage 3. II. That in Luristm from the Gashur pass to Khurramabsd. I. Is inhabited almost throughout in settled villages. The best time for the passage of this section is from June to the end of August vide supplies below. In winter the passage of troops would be less easy owing to the snow from December to February, but the route is practicable throughout the year. Cavalry could reach Harsin ( 2 ) in one march from the Kirm'nsh'h plain if necessary ; Inf -ntry could, if desired, shorten the stages by halting on the Kirmanshah plain ( 1 ) 5 m. short of Hajiabad ( 8 ) at Chahr ( 3 ) Harsin. II. The second section contains no settled village from the G.'shur pass to the centre of the Aushtar p-ain ; nor from Alishtar to Khurramabad. It is, with the exception of the Alishtar, deserted from the beginning of October to May. From December to March101 the road is under deep snow ; it must therefore be considered a summer road travers able only from May to October. The passage of infantry without cavalry would be difficult as the supplies have to be collected from a wide area as a rule, and the flocks and herds required would have to be driven in. With cavalry no difficulty would be experienced ; they should pass from Harsin ( 8 ) to Alishtar ( 6 ) in two days and from thereto Khur- ramabad in one day. fatal distance, — 110 miles in 8 stages. Road. —I. Passable all arms as far as Tamarg at the head of the Harsin valley. From there to the G ishur pass, 3 miles, requires widening and improving for the passage of artil lery. The gradients are not steep. II. From the Sirkani valley (3) to the exit from Alishtar in stage 6 , the road could b® made practicable for artillery with some considerable work, but no rock exists and it could all be done with the spade. From KakX Rizx in stage 7 to the R abat pass in stage 8 , much work would be required and rock cutting at the Takutu and Rabat passes. The Go vernor of Khurramabld formerly took guns yearly to the Alishtar plain, but none but Persians are likely to attempt a like feat. From Chahr to the S. E. edge of the Alishtar plain the road is protected from the N. by high and rugged mountains ; and from the Alishtar plain to the Rabat pass only, is the country in any way confined, or the road contracted by gorges of adjacent mountains, where the advance of troops could be barred by inferior numbers. This road is closed to the ordinary traveller and to caravans, and can be more safely travelled in August and September than at other times, a? the authorities are then engaged in collecting the yearly revenue with the assistance of a large number of troops. Supplies. —I. From June to the end of August the crops are either green, ripening or being reaped ; grass is abundant and the numerous floeks and herds are scattered about along the route. During autumn, September to November, forage is less plentiful; the crops are cut and supplies housed. In the spring, from April to May, grass is procurable according to the elevation. Supplies, however, are short. II. From the middle of May o October grass is plentiful. Vast numbers of goat and sheep, and many cattle are pastured along the road, and small camps of black tents are al most always in sight. The crops which are sown in September ripen, according to the elevation, the following summe , and are available as green forage to June and July, being cut and threshed to the end of August. These crops are wheat and barley. During Au gust and September also the Indian corn crop is available either green or ripe. Water. —Plentiful throughout in both I and II, Grazing .— Vide supplies.

To the S. of the village there is a large bdgh but there is no camping space in it, N. B.—In gauging the quantity of grain in villages, a thing it is almost impossible to do accurately, it is best to calculate it according to the number of houses or huts. The people store enough to keep them going till the crop comes in the following year the majority is sold. For the yearly produce the best average to take is as follows -—For every 50 houses or huts a yearly produce of 500 kharwdra wheat, 500 kharwdrs barlev (1 kharwdr..Q50 lbs), J SlKWANfr to Talandasht. By caravan, 4\ hours. Road,- From Sirwanu to tiio JLb-i-j\farik it is only an indistinct pathway across the Talley but all vehicles could pass over it. There is no bridge over the Ab-i-Marik; stream about 2 yards broad and about 1 J deep. It has steep banks but could very easily and quickly bej bridged. The water in this stream is very good drinking water. From this ■ point to the foot of the Tang-i-Kulilan the road is a broad track and passable for all transport. This pass has a few difficult parts though generally good, no gradients over 10°. The track as it now is, is passable for animal transport only, no serious obstacles. Country .—The Mahidasht valley is very highly cultivated and there are many villages here, near some of which there is excellent grazing. The Kuh-i-Zardilan is wooded so there is plenty of wood always available. Villages,—Sarpushik. About 50 houses. Belongs to Habibullah Khan of Slrwanfl. Wheat and barley already stored.

This is the name given to the whole of this valley which runs N. W. into the Kalhur country. In the whole of this valley there are some 2,000 huts scattered about. The people are of Zanganoh tribe. They can produce about 3,000 rifles ; practically no sowars. In the winter these people migrate to the Pusht-i-Kuh country, even as far away as Badrai. For this privilege they pay money to the Wall of Pusth-i-Kuh. Some also go with the Kalhurs to their winter quarters at Gilan. The people of this valley are not Kurds : they are Saiyids. Wheat, barley and straw are plentiful in this valley. When the people retire to their winter quarters they sell most of it before their departure, in Kirmanshah, only taking sufficient, with them for their own maintenance. Present rate, 8 to 10 Tabriz min (b^ lbs.) to the h an for barley; 12 to 13 Tabriz man to the krdn for straw. About 50,000 sheep aiH cattle in the valley. No farrier. Camping ground 4,300. TaPAndasht TO J Alii la wand. By caravan, hours to camming ground. Road. Suitable for mule and donkey transport only. Almost immediately one turns into the Tang-i-Surkhbeg. This pass is a little difficult, the pathway through it being at times very rocky; there are no very steep, gradients but it would take a good deal of preparation to make it of practical use for transport. The next pass, Tang-i-Kharribeg, £ the only other obstacle, though nothing very serious, causing practically no delay. These two passess practically lead into one another in the mountains. From this latter pass down the Jelalwand valley there is a continuous descent, the first half mile of which is very steep, but afterwards a steady gradual docline. The pathway from the Tang-i-Khar ribeg to the camping ground on the Ab-i-Jazman is good and clear and not stony. Mules did the journey without much difficulty, only two falling in the passes. Water: There is no water met with until one strikes the Ab-i-Jazman. Country The country passed through is very hilly. Abundance of dry grazing on the hill sides. The country is wooded, but it is mostly scrub jungle after leaving the Tang-i-Kharribeg. Villages. The Jelalawand tribe inhabit the country from the Tang-i-Kharribeg as far as Hulailan and about a day and half’s journey to the S. W.: in all there are about 2 000 huts. This tribe belongs to ’AH Murad Khan of Karind. They are AH Ullahis. The people of Jelalawand can produce about 700 rifles of all descriptions they supply 200 sowars to ’ Ali Murad Khan. In the part of Jelalawand passed through this morning I saw crops of:— Rice, cotton in large quantities, dhal, mung, Indian corn. All wheat and barley had been taken in. Present rates.—Barley 13 Jcrdns per kJmrwdr, straw 1| krdns per 130 lbs. Take the usual average for determining the supply. There were about 200 huts in the vicinity of my camping ground; these huts start with the Ab-i-Jazman. Ab-i-Jazman.—l am unable to say whether the main stream originates from the N, W. source or the N. source. That from the N. W. in the Jelalawand valley origi nates from several springs and is excellent drinking water, quite narrow but broadening out when the two streams meet at my camping ground. Here the bed of the river is about 50 yards across. There is only 1' of water now. Stony bed. JELALAWAND TO hulailan. (Imimz-i-Shah Muhammad, 3700'). By caravan, hours. Road. —Is a track the whole way and suitable for animal transport only. The first 2 or 3 m. the road is very narrow and greatly cut up by irrigation cuttings. After coming out of the Jelalawand valley it passes over easy undulating ground and it is a good open t rack but owing to constant nalas it is rendered impassable for wheeled transport. In the first 2 m the Ab-i-Jazman has to be crossed twice ; at the first point the bed of the river is about 100 yards across ; the stream 15 yards; at the second point the stream is about 20 yards across and has more force of water.

This pass would require a good deal of blasting and P^paration make it of practical use. From this pass, the point marked 5150 in map there isa track on e steady decline, nothing difficult, but only fit for mules and donkeys.
