Italy has never declared coal to be contraband and though Turkey did at first include fuel in their Contraband List, that List was subsequently modified to bring it into harmony with the Italian decree.

The Resident at Aden is evidently under a misappre hension as to the obligations of neutral States in regard to the carriage of contraband and his action, as Lord ! Crewe is aware,both in regard to foodstuffs for the pilgrims, the detention of stores,and the export of coal has given rise to no little inconvenience. In this connexion I am to refer to the letter from this Office of the 1st. instant and to express the hope ) that it may be clearly explained to The Resident that British authorities are under no obligation to prohibit the carriage even of contraband articles which are conveyed subject to the usual risk of capture.

JMnllet.Extract from a letter from the Foreign Office to His Majesty*s Customs, dated November 17th 1911. The general principles affecting Government inter vention in these cases were so fully set out in the cor respondence which passed between His Majesty's Customs and this Department in 1S04 that it is unnecessary to recapitulate them. Since that date the principles of international law underlying this question have been em bodied in two Conventions respecting the duties of neutrals in warfare, both of which v/ere signed by the British Representatives at the Peace Conference at The Hague in 1907. These Conventions provide inter alia that 'a neutral Power is not bound to prevent the export or transit for either belligerent of arms, munitions of war, or in general of anything which could be of use to an army or fleet”. Under Article 8 of the Maritime Neutrality Conven tion, one of the Conventions referred to above, a Power is bound to prevent the departure from its jurisdiction&gt; of a vessel intended to take part in hostile operations, which has been adapted for warlike use wholly or partly within such jurisdiction. With regard to the Foreign Enlistment Act, the question whether the goods conveyed have or have not been declared by either or both belligerents to be Con traband of War is immaterial in considering the question of any action by His Majesty's Government tinder that Ac j, biiu it appears that neither Turkey not Italy deem coal to be Contraband in connection with the present war. The net result is therefore that His Majesty's Government are not bound by the obligations of neutrality, as imposed by general international law and treaty, to detain a ship unless it has been adapted for naval ser vice, at any rate partially^within their jurisdiction, and it is in regard to these cases alone that it is in cumbent on His Majesty's Government to ascertain and prevent any breach of the rule. No sufficient cause for interference appears to have been established in any ofof the cases mentioned hy the Board. Action under the Foreign Enlistment Act, i.e., for breach of the municipal law of this country, need not he taken unless facts raising a prima facie case against the ship come to the knowledge of His Majesty's Govern ment. In cases such as that of vessels employed in the transport of material for naval use, such action is only possible where the vessel can be shown to have entered practically the naval or military service of the belli gerent state. To comply with this condition it would be necessary to show that the vessel was to carry out her voyage under the control of the belligerent Govern ment . vI I ' I CONTRABAND OF WAR: SYNOPSIS OF ITALIAN \ I DECLARATION. * I ! Foreign Office, October 6, 1911. His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has received from His Majesty’s Am bassador at Rome a telegram stating that the Italian Government have issued a Declaration with respect to articles deemed by them to be Contraband of War during the existing hostili ties between Italy and Turkey. This Declaration, it is stated, specifies can non, firearms, and sidearms of all descriptions, munitions of war, military tools of all kinds, and generally everything which without mani pulation can be put to immediate use in connec tion with maritime or land warfare. As soon as the actual text of the Declaration is received by His Majesty’s Government it will be published in the London Gazette. {Extract from the London Gazette of Friday, 6 October, 1911.)CONTRABAND OF WAR: ITALIAN DECLARATION # Foreign Office, October 9, 1911.

The Ministry for Foreign Affairs has the honour to notify that, having regard to the state of war existing between Italy and Turkey, the following articles will be considered by Italy as Contraband of War in accordance with the provisions of the Mercantile Marine Code of the Kingdom: — Cannon, rifles, carbines, revolvers, pistols, swords and other weapons, whether firearms or sidearms, munitions of war, military equip ment of every species, and generally every thing which without manipulation can be put to immediate use in connection with land or maritime warfare. The Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs at the same time notifies that, since the Ottoman Government have taken no steps with a view to exempting Italian merchant vessels from cap ture, but, on the contrary, have committed acts of seizure and capture to the prejudice of Italian merchant vessels, the Royal Govern ment, in conformity with the provisions of the laws in force and the general principles of the law of nations, reserve to themselves the right of capture and seizure of Ottoman merchant vessels. The Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs will be glad if the above declaration can be brought as soon as possible to the knowledge of the Governments concerned. {Extract from the London Gazette of Tuesday, 10 October, 1911.)

Since the vessel is engaged on purely commercial and postal business, the refusal of the Aden Authorities does not appear to be in any way justified.

The Right Honourable Sir Edward Grey to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty* : — Foreign Office, October 3, 1911. My Lords, His Majesty being fully determined to observe the duties of neutrality during the existing state of war between Italy and Turkey; being, moreover, resolved to prevent, as far as possible, the use of His Majesty’s harbours, ports, and coasts, and the waters within His Majesty’s territorial jurisdiction, in aid of the warlike purposes of either belligerent, has commanded me to commu nicate to your Lordships, for your guidance, the following Rules, which are to be treated and enforced as His Majesty’s orders and directions: — Rule 1. During the continuance of the present state of war, all ships of war of either belligerent are prohibited from making use | of any port or roadstead in the United King- [ dom, the Isle of Man, or the Channel Islands, or in any of His Majesty’s Colonies or foreign possessions or dependencies, or of any waters : subject to the territorial jurisdiction of the British Crown, as a station or place of resort for any warlike purpose, or for the purpose of ! obtaining any facilities for warlike equipment; and no ship of war of either belligerent shall hereafter be permitted to leave any such port, | roadstead, or waters from which any vessel of the other belligerent (whether the same shall be a ship of war or a merchant ship) shall have previously departed until after the expiration of at least twenty-four hours from the departure of such last-mentioned vessel beyond the territorial jurisdiction of His Majesty. Rule 2. If there is now . in any such port, roadstead, or waters subject to the territorial jurisdiction of the British Crown any ship of war of either belligerent, such ship of war shall leave such port, roadstead, or waters within such time not less than twenty-four hours as shall be reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances and the condition of such ship as to repairs, provisions, or things neces- sary for the subsistence of her crew; and if after the date hereof any ship of war of either belligerent shall enter any such port, road stead, or waters, subject to the territorial jurisdiction of the British Crown, such ship shall depart and put to sea within twenty- four hours after her entrance into any such port, roadstead, or waters, except in case of stress of weather, or of her requiring provi sions or things necessary for the subsistence, her.crew, or repairs; in either of which ca^ the authorities of the port, or of the neared port (as the case may be), shall require her to put to sea as soon as possible after the expiration of such period of twenty-four hours, without permitting her to take in supplies beyond what may be necessary for her immediate use; and no such vessel which may have been allowed to remain within British waters for the purpose of repair shall continue in any such port, roadstead, or waters, for a longer period than twenty-four hours after her necessary repairs shall have been com pleted. Provided, nevertheless, that in all cases in which there shall be any vessels (whether ships of war or merchant ships) of both the said belligerent parties in the same port, roadstead, or waters within the terri torial jurisdiction of His Majesty, there shall be an interval of not less than twenty-four hours between the departure therefrom of any such vessel (whether a ship of war or merchant ship) of the one belligerent, and the subse quent departure therefrom of any ship of war of the other belligerent; and the time hereby limited for the departure of such ships of war respectively shall always, in case of necessity, be extended so far as may be requisite for giving effect to this proviso, but no further or otherwise. Rule 3. No ship of war of either belligerent shall hereafter be permitted, while in any such port, roadstead, or waters subject to the territorial jurisdiction of His Majesty, to take in any supplies, except provisions and such other things as may be requisite for the sub sistence of her crew, and except so much coal only as may be sufficient to carry such vessel to the nearest port of her own country, or to some nearer named neutral destination, and no coal shall again be supplied to any such ship of war in the same or any other port, roadstead, or waters subject to the territorial jurisdiction of His Majesty, without special permission, until after the expiration of three months from the time when such coal mav have been last supplied to her within British waters as aforesaid. Rule 4. Armed ships of either belligerent are interdicted from carrying prizes made by them into the ports, harbours, roadsteads, or waters of the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands, or any of His Majesty’s Colonies or possessions abroad. The Governor or other chief authority of each of His Majesty’s territories or possessions bevond the seas shall forthwith notify and publish the above Rules. * Similar letters to the Treasury, Home Office, Colonial Office, War Office.
