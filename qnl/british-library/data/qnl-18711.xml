Captain Arnold Burrowes Kemball, Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, states that the man was severely bastinadoed by order of the Governor, without Kemball's sanction, and was only released after Stevens had intervened on his behalf. Kemball requests information on the degree of interference exercised by Stevens and the nature of the charge that was brought against Ghooloom Ali. Kemball expresses his suspicion that the grounds for punishment were fabricated in order to support a vindictive prosecution. A copy of a statement made by Ghooloom Ali, dated 14 September, is enclosed with this letter.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023612308.0x000005#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
