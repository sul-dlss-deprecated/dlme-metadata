Will you kindly refer to your demi-official letter No.P.Z.1735/35, dated the 21st March 1935, to Garoe? I am desired to say that the Government of India share the opinion expressed in the concluding sentence of your letter. To J.G^Laithwaite, Esqr., G.I.E., India Office, London.COPY. 78055/35. Colonial Office, Downing Street, S.W. !• 12th March, 1935. My dear Reilly, In answer to your letter of the 5th December, 1934 regarding the revision of the travelling and daily allowances paid to certain of the staff at Aden, we have now heard from the India Office that the Government of India have introduced certain revised rates applicable to the Protectorate. So far as the Arabic staff are concerned these revised rates take the place of the proposals made in your despatch No. 166 of the 27th June r' last and we have no comment to offer on the matter, as the staff in question are servants of the Government of India, and come under Indian regulations. So far as the Regulations affect the ♦Political’ Officers (Lake, Ingrams, Hamilton and Seager), as you are aware, we agreed to revised rates in their case in the Secretary of State’s despatch No. 132 of the 17th November 1934. The only difference between the rates sanctioned by us and those sanctioned by the revised Government of India Regulations appears to be a reduction in the mileage rate from 8 annas to 6 annas a mile. You appear to have agreed for the sake of uniformity to this reduction in your letter of the 1st December 1934 to Caroe but we should be glad if you would inform us whether you recommend that this reduction should be enforced, and if so, from what date you propose enforcing it. The Government of India favours uniformity, but if you feel on reconsideration LIEUTENANT COLONEL that SIR BERNARD REILLY, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., D.S.O.that the rate of 8 annas a mile is still justified we should he prepared to support its continuance vis-a-vis the India Office so far as our ’Political f Officers are concerned. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) H.R. COWELL,© * COPY, n THE RESIDENCY, ADEN. 29th March, 1935. My dear Cowell, Thank you for your letter of the 12th March, 1935. I have discussed the point raised in it with Lake and the Political Officers here, and they agree that the rate of 6 annas is in fact sufficient to cover actual cost, and I consider that for the sake of uniformity the reduction of 8 annas to 6 annas should he enforced. I propose that this should he done from the 1st April, 1935. Yours sincerely, ( Sgd. ) B.R. Reilly. H.R. Cowell, Esquire, C.M.G., Colonial Office, London.J. G. LAITHWAITE, B3Q. , 0. X. B. .735 j % Downing Street, S.W.1. /-? March, 1935. My dear Laithwaite, Thank you for your letter of the 2nd February, 1935, No.P.Z.502/3U regarding the travelling allowances of certain officers in Aden. The correspondence on the subject has become rather involved, and I think it would be advisable if I set out the position as it appears to us. Taking the last sentence of your letter first, we have in the past accepted as a charge on United Kingdom funds tne whole cost of the travelling of the Resident in cases where the travelling was on some business of an entirely political nature, and we shall be willing in the future to agree to a similar course in those cases where the circumstances indicate that such an arrangement is a fair one, but I think that we must consider each case on its merits rather than agree to any general principle. As regards the mileage and daily allowances forTW for the staff of the Arabic Branch (i.e. the interpreters branch), we agree that these must be the basis of the revised Government of India Regulations. The staff concerned are, of course, servants of the Government of India and must be bound by Indian Regulations, and we do not feel that we are directly concerned in this matter, though, of course, we like to be kept informed of such things. The basis of division of the officers 1 salaries and their travelling etc., allowances have already been agreed upon and are included in the quarterly claims we receive from the Government of India. As regards the 'Political* Officers who have been appointed by us and whose emoluments are borne entirely on United Kingdom funds, we recently agreed to revised rates of mileage and daily allowances, and the only effect we can see of the application to these officers of the new Indian rates is to reduce the mileage allowance from 8 annas to 6 annas a mile. We are, however, consulting Reilly further to see whether he thinks this reduction is called for in view of the recent date of the paid on sanctionsanction of our revised rates, and I will let you know the results of our enquiry in due course. Yours sincerely,• ~#50«i/55.

As a result of further demi-official correspondence with Sir Bernard Reilly (copy of which has Been forwarded by him direct to the Colonial Office) the Government of India have been pleased to ‘sanction increased rates of dally allowance for Central Govern ment officers travelling in the protectorate, except in the case of Chief Commissioner, Aden, who is entitled to a special rate of daily allowance of Rs.15/- a day, and consider for the sake of uniformity that similar rates should be sanctioned for the Colonial Officers serving in that area. 2 . it might be mentioned however that the Government of India will be very little concerned in practice as their officers from the Settlement will rarely, if ever, be employed in the Protectorate (except in the case of dual personalities such as tne ChiefForeign and Political Department, The 193 Chief Commissioner-cum-Resident) and, when they are so employed and have to travel in that area, presumably the cost of travelling v/ould fall on the Colonial Office Estimates. \ To J.

The Residency, Aden, 15th September, 1934. s,. My dear Metcalfe, Please refer to your demi-official telegram No. 652-E dated 4th September, 1934. I consider that the conditions mentioned in Government of India, Finance Department, letter I;o. F.9(±3) —R. 1/31 dated 27th April, 1933, in describing ''special tracts' undoubtedly apply to the Aden Protec torate as distinct from the Settlement of Aden. In the Protectorate, which is a very mountainous country, communications (apart from those supplied by the Royal Air Force, which cannot be used as a matter of course) are extremely bad, there being neither roads nor railways, and supplies are generally difficult and expensive to obtain. In Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Memorandum No. F.19(39)-E/33 dated 10th March, 1934, it is stated that no part of Aden has ever been treated in the past as a special tract. The reasons for this are that, as far as I am aware, there were no special tracts under the Government of India prior to 1933, and also probably because there was little actual contact with the Protectorate and travelling in it was generally limited to the immediate neighbourhood of Aden. Conditions now are completely different, as under the Colonial Office the Political staff for dealing with the Protectorate has been greatly increased and Colonial Service officers and other personnel may be required at any time to visit any portion of the Protectorate, which in its widest extent covers an area of about 42,000 square miles. InIn these circunstances I consider it necessary to revise the travelling a^lorrance rates 'which previously existed, and in my opinion special tract rates as laid ^ down 'by the Government of India are appropriate. For this reason th§ G-overnment of* India were requested to include the Aden Protectorate in their list of* special tracts, and it was supposed that their refusal to accept this recommen dation was due mainly to the fact that they are now directly concerned only with the Settlement of Aden itself, within which special rates would he unjustifiable, and not with the Protectorate, which is under the control of the Colonial Office. I therefore addressed the Colonial Office with recommendations based on actual experience, and I am stiongly of opinion that these necessary concessions to Colonial Service staff ought not to be withheld because the Government of India have not granted similar concessions to their own staff who may be employed in the Protectorate, If Government of India staff were so employed it would possibly be in connection with Colonial Service duties, for which Government of India staff from Aden could obviously be used only in very exceptional circumstances, and in such circumstances I assume that the Colonial Office would probably be willing to pay their travelling allowance in accordance with whatever scale they sanction for their own servants. There may be occasional instances in which a Government of India servant (e.g. a Police Officer) may be required to visit places in the Protectorate on purely Government of India work, but these will be very rare. I still consider that such cases will be dealt with best by the classification of the Aden Protectorate as a soecial tract by the Government of India, and for the reasons that I have explained I venture to recommend a reconsideration of the Government of India's decision on this point. IfP. Z. 488 6/34. political Department. tu v/jj Minute Paper. Secretary, Financial Department, The pay and allowances of the Interpreters* Branch of the Political Staff of the Resident at Aden are classed as w Political' and as such are included in the Political and Military expenditure towards which India pays one-third, subject to a maximum of £150 f c*o year. Hitherto the rates of daily allowance issued to these personnel have been based on Indian regulations. The Resident now proposes to break away from these regulations as regards daily allowance, since he consider that they are not suitable for the special conditions obtaining in the Aden Protectorate. The change he proposes is that daily allowance should be at the rate of Government of India regulations it hardly seems necessar to consult the Government of India It is therefore suggested that we might concur outright in the proposal. A draft letter is accordingly submitted for approval. Rs.2 for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Interpreters, instead of Rs.1.14, J.. 8 , and 14 annas resoectively.

I am to enquire whether any objection is seen to the payment to the Interpreters of allow ances at the rates recommended by the Resident, and to state that if there is no objection it is proposed to ask the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury to sanction the allowances recommended. I am. Sir, Your most obedient Servant, THE UNDER SECRETARY OP STATE INDIA OFFICE.i 9 3 4 __ J THE RESIDENCY, Aden, 27th June 1934, Sin I have the honour to refer to the mileage and daily allowances which have been sanctioned in the peat for the interpreters* branch of the Political staff, which are wholly a charge on His Majesty’s Government, These allowances are governed by Government of India regulations and ere fixed on a sliding scale according to rates of oay. 2. The question of the revision of these allowances has arisen owing to Government of India (Finance Department) Resolution No,F.9(13)-R.1/31 of the 27th April 1933 under which specially increased rates were laid down applicable to expensive localities which are recognised as being markedly more expensive both for travelling and living. These localities are termed by the Government of India “special tracts”• In a subsequent Resolution dated 9th November 1933 a list of such localities was given, from which the Aden Protectorate was omitted, inspite of Mr.Champion (who was acting for me at the time) having recommended that it should be treated as a “special tract 3. The matter was referred again by Colonel tightwick to the Government of India who gave a final refusal on the grounds that “no part of Aden had ever been treated in the past as a special tract*. The transfer of the control of the Aden Protectorate from the Government of India to His Majesty's Government may possibly furnish the reason for such a refusal and for drawing no distinction between the Aden Settlement andV. the Aden Protectorate* 4* As regards daily allowances! the maximum rate which can be drawn by the Head Interpreter under existing regulations is Rs,3A, and by the 2nd, 3rd and 4th interpreters, Rs.1/14/-, Rs.1/8/- and As*14/-, respectively based on their graduation of pay. But I wish to point out that, in practice, the increased cost of living and the wear and tear of kit when travelling in the Aden Protectorate is similar for all the lower grades whether their pay be Rs.50A or Rb. 150A. Only in the case of the Head Interpreter are expenses heavier, as, on the rare occasions on which it is necessary to send him out, the need for his presence indicates an important occasion and results in the transport of kit and entertaining on increased scale. 5. I therefore recommend that His Majesty's Government should sanction fixed rates of daily allowances for the Interpreters 1 branch of my Political staff and that the practice of basing the rates on Government of India Regulations should cease. I further recommend that these rates should be Rs.3/- for the Head Interpreter and Rs.2A for all other grades. 6. As regards mileage allowances, I recommend that the existing rates of As. 4A and As.2/- for the Head Interpreter and lower grades respectively should continue. I have the honour to be, Sir, ^ r i Your most obedient, humble 4a ervant, ( Signed ) B. R. Reilly.
