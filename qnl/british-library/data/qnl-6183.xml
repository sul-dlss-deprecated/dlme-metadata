HANDBOOK OF ASIK. Prepared by the Arab Bureau, Cairo. FIRST EDITION, JUNE 1, 1816. CAIRO. Government Press. 1910 ,PREFATORY NOTE. This Handbook has been compiled by Captain K. Cornwallis almost entirely from native information obtained recently in Cairo, but gathered originally in Asir itself not later than the outbreak of the present war. This has been checked as far as possible bv the comparison of one informant with another, but by little else, there being almost no European literature on Asir of any value, and no European having visited the interior of the country and furnished- a report since the French surgeons and others who accompanied the Egyptian forces in the thirties of the last century. This Handbook is not put forward, therefore, as authoritative or possessing more than relative value. Fuller notes on the tribes as well as on prominent individuals in Asir, based on the same information as this Handbook, will be found in “ Arabia and Syria Personalities,” issued by the Admiralty War Staff Intelligence Division.CONTENTS.

The term “ Asir ” is understood nowadays to denote all that part of Western Arabia which lies immediately south of Hejaz, between the latter and Yemen ; but it is of onlv quite modern use as a designation for anything more than the section of the Main Ridge and the Aqabah occupied by the four tribes of Beni Mugheid, Beni Malek, Alqam el-Hul, and Rufeidet el-Yemen, all of whom live round the capital, Ebhah. Even now it is not always understood by natives to denote the same or any clearly defined region. It is convenient, however, to apply the term to all the area intervening between the southern limit of Heiaz (a line drawn inland from Lith) and the northern boundary of the jurisdiction of the Imam of Yemen (about latitude 17° 15' N.). To this must be added the seaboard and the maritime plain down to latitude 16°, where the Wadi 'Ain divides the Idrissi’s territory from that of the Turks. Its extension from the Red Sea to the east is difficult to define, since, as is the case with Hejaz, its eastern districts are not separated by any exact boundary from the steppes and deserts of Nejd. A line_ drawn from the coast to Bishah measures about 180 miles. In the southern part the boundary marches with that of the Yam tribes of Nejran.Internally this region is still not sufficiently known for the details of its relief to be described; but, broadly, it may be said that the first Hejaz zone, the low sandy maritime belt, is prolonged southwards with a breadth of twenty or thirty miles through Asir to meet the Tihamah of Yemen, while the second, third, and fourth Hejaz zones are, in Asir, less sharply distinguished one from another. Instead of the low, rounded, and dusty hills which form the second zone in Hejaz, we find a lofty escarpment ( c Aqabah) backed by a plateau region (third zone), which falls little, if at all, eastwards towards the foot of the main ridge of the fourth Hejaz zone. This ridge is here uniformly higher than in Hejaz, ranging from 6,000 to 7,000 feet or more. From its crest-line, lying on an average about eighty miles from the coast (nearer in the north and farther in the south), the land-level falls away gradually north-eastward towards Nejd.Xn. PHYSICAL CHARACTER AND CLIMATE. Since Asir receives the fringe of the monsoon, which reaches Yemen in autumn, and since it provides a lofty, gradually inclined and broad catchment area, the wide valleys which run from the main ridge, not only south- westward down the short seaward slope, but north-eastward down the long slope towards Central Arabia, are com paratively fertile. All this north-eastern slope is seamed with valleys—main wadis like A\ adi Ranya, \A adi Bishah, and tributaries like Wadi Shahran and Wadi Akik—divided by hi oh hills or dusty intervals of steppe. ' The larger valleys carry water throughout the year either on or near the surface of their channels, and since large tracts of both harm and nefud desert are absent, the aspect of the innermost zone of Asir is very different to the corre sponding district in Hejaz. Tamisier, who m 1834 traversed what we should now call the north-east and south-east frontiers of Asir, speaks with enthusiasm of the smiling and fertile appearance of some of the valleys which he visited, but he left untouched some of the most productive districts The principal wadis run towards A\ adi Dawasir, in Southern Nejd. But what is their exact ultimate destination, and how far inland their fertility is maintained, we do not at present know. The inland fringe of the main ridge is almost uniformly fertile and the country from Tanumah to Temniah compares favourably with any in the central highlands of Yemen To the east of the main ridge, long and broad ribbons ol oasis, trending north, occur frequently and serve to keep an agricultural and settled element preponderant m the population. The dusty intervals of steppe between wadis are oood for nothing except lean pasturage ; but the valleys themselves are well watered and produce good crops ot— 4 — cereals and fruit in abundance. While doubtless invaders, such as the Egyptian armies which traversed the region from time to time between 1832 and 1841, have suffered from insufficiency of supplies, this has been due partly to the nature of the country to be crossed between the main valleys, and partly to the fact that districts fertile enough for local needs were unable or unwilling to support hostile forces of 10,000 or 12,000 men. Such a force remained encamped in Wadi Bishah for a fortnight in 1834. The district round Khamis Mishait is described in modern days as fertile par excellence, and Wadi Shahran, a tributarv of Wadi Bishah, is called by Tamisier “a jewel coveted by all conquerors.' The seaward slopes of the main ridge and the escarpments, which lead down to the Tihamah, are in the north of Asir barren and forbidding, except in the valleys ; in the south they are covered in many places with dense woods and traversed by many rivulets. The inter vening plateau, though hotter than the Main Ridge, is nevertheless productive and well watered and supports a large population. While the highlands are the most productive part of Asir, the Tihamah or seaboard country, though throughout sandy and salty, is less barren than in Hejaz, and indeed in the Qunfudah, Hali, and Sabiyah districts yields a fair amount of produce. In the southern and central Tihamah, light and local rains occasionally fall in February and March, and there is a heavier precipitation in June during the season of the Kharif. Further north, both in the Tihamah and inland, the rainfall is irregular. The most favoured localities are the Aqabah and Main Ridge, which receive a copious precipita tion during the autumnal monsoon and occasional showers in June and July. Tamisier speaks from experience of very violent thunder and rain in the neighbourhood of Khamis Mishait in the month of July. The climate of the Tihamah, which is subject to strong south-west winds, is as hot as in Hejaz ; but the water supply is both more abundant and of better quality. The inner country is cooler on the whole— 5 — than in Hejaz, the 'Aqabah and plateau being better favoured than the corresponding Hejaz zones ; the climate of th hill country is described by the t£ Arabian Gazetteei ^ perate. On the inland slopes of the ridge, which has a General north-eastward aspect, the winter is comparatively severe : night frosts are regular and frequent.— (&gt; TV.—POPULATION. 1 he total population of Asir, if calculated from the numbers of fighting men mentioned later in the description of tribes, would be 1,500,000. These numbers, however, are based entirely on native information and should be accepted with reserve; but they are given in the absence of any more positive and reliable data. In all probability the_v are an overestimate. The main constituent is a highland farmer element, warlike and tenacious of liberty, living in the upper wadis on both flanks of the main ridge, but only in a few places collected into urban settlements of any considerable size. Qunfudah on the coast, Muhail, Hijal, Khamis Mishait, Ebhah, Sabiyah, inland, may be called towns,^ and there are many large villages where the local trade is focussed ; but the available descriptions of inland settlements suggest, rather than towns, villages with chains of dependent farmsteads and groups of huts distributed along the valley bottom and sides and often protected by torts on the adjacent heights. In the last century Wadi Bishah is said to have possessed sixtv villages, and the number has not decreased. As in Nejran, the Jauf of Yemen, and Hadramaut, these settlements serve as nuclei of tribes with fringes of unsettled clans, which roam the intervening steppes and mountain heights in quest of pasturage. There has always been a strong social and political distinction between the farmers of the lower inland wadis and those of the upper parts, and the Main Ridge, the proper “Asir” as well as between the latter and the men of the Wqabah and Tihamah. Rut the distinction goes further than this, and V 1 110 P art of Arabia are the tribal elements more sharplv defined or their boundaries more immutablv fixed than iii Asir There is an understanding, in times of peace, that members of one tribe may pass through the territories of— 8 Settled Arabs multiply more rapidly than unsettled, and tubes which for any reason have abandoned wandering life ior fixed agriculture have often been known to double or treble their numbers in two or three generations. Obvious reasons for such increase are better quality and greater quantity of foodstuffs enjoyed in settled life, and the'easier conditions which obtain for women in pregnancy and parturi tion and for their offspring during infancy. This fact has to be borne in mind when judging the high totals given by native authorities for the population of such regions as Asir and Yemen. To the former never less than about a million and a half, and often much more, are ascribed by Arab informants ; and though we may suspect even the minimum to be an excessive figure, it is not an impossible one. No means of checking it exist, the actual numbers of fighting men known to have been put in line on any occasion beino no good criterion in so divided and distracted a region. m °st numerous and powerful tribes occupy the Main tidge with the heads of the inland valleys and the upper parts of the c Aqabah. Here we find in succession from north to south the great units of the Zahran, the Ghamid, the Shumran, the Bal arian, the Bulqarn, the Beni Shihir the four tribes of the Ahl Barak, the Er-Raish, Ahl Musa the Balasmar, the Rabi'yeh wa Rufeidah, and the Balahmar. With the next two tribes, the Rijal el- M a and the Beni Mugheid, the most famous and most developed tribal organizations in Asir, we reach the heart of the country, the surroundings of Ebhah (Manadir), and the hinterland of Mikhlaf el-Yemen. The strono- tribes of the Alqam el-Hul, Beni Malek (to be distinguished Horn the Hejaz tribe of that name), and RabTyet el- Yemen also he round Ebhah ; and both behind all these and intruded among them, in a wedge of territory which runs from the heads of Wadis Bishah and Shahran to within twenty miles of Sabiyah, lies the most numerous of all Asiri tribes, the Shahran. Finally, in the south-eastern interior o the region, live the six Qahtan tribes, each an autono-Hi — 9 — mous unit, and none of them to he confounded with the nomad Qahtan of the south-western region of Central Arabia, The Tihamah tribes are, as a rule, smaller units and less vigorous. In the north, where the land conditions are least favourable, they take largely to seafaring. The Dhuwwi Hassan and Dhuwwi Barakat, who occupy the coast from Lith to Uruj, are fishermen and pirates. The Zubeid sub-section of the Harb, which succeeds to these, contains also some sailors, but with it and the Beni Zeid of the Qunfudah district begin predominantly agricul tural units, which generally own one or more port villages, or, sitting astride the tracks to the interior, profit by com merce, even if they do not practise it. So live the Bel air, the Hali federation, the Beni Hilal, and the Munjahah. After the last begins the favoured and well settled district of Mikhlaf el-Yemen, where the Idrissi has established some sort of law and order, increasing from the north, which is held by the Beni Sh'ibah and the NajiT, to his homeland of Sabiyah and Abu' Arish. His authority holds to the southern limit of Asir; but the comparatively small tribes lying south of Abu 'Arish, of which the Masarehah, the Beni Marwan, the Beni Hassan, the Beni Aslam, and the Beni °Abs, are the more important, better maintain tribal autonomy, and in means and manner of life approximate to the units holding the coast north ot Mikhlaf el-Yemen.Y.-DOMESTIC APPARATUS AND MANUFACTURES. Except round Ebhah and Qunfudah, where the Turks have exercised a civilizing influence amongst the better-class natives, the inhabitants of Asir live under very primitive and simple conditions. In the Tihamah their dwelling places are rounded huts of straw brushwood with pointed roofs and are generally surrounded by a straw compound. The floors are of pounded clay with a raised place for a fire. Their beds resemble the angaribs of the Sudan, a lacing of rope or thongs on a wooden frame-work supported bv four wooden legs. Up the ^Aqabah and along the Main Ridge, a man’s house is his fortress and is built to last. The big chiefs have huge rambling structures massively built of stone and sometimes running up to four or five storeys. The doors are solid, the windows square with wooden shutters, and the roofs flat, supported by stout beams over which are laid branches of trees and then a surface of clay. Each house has its own yard surrounded by a stone wall. The houses of the &gt;Shahran and Qahtan tribes are of a similar type, save that above the first floor they are built of clay. Inside there is little furniture, but the houses are kept clean and are never used as privies, as is the case elsewhere in Arabia, bor beds straw mats are used, covered with a thick sheepskin furwah or rug. In all big houses as eparate room is set aside for the kitchen. In eating, the men kneel on their haunches round a big wooden platter and help themselves with their fingers. Copper cooking utensils come from Aclen, copper coffee-pots from Meccah, while clav plates, water jars, and cups, are made locally. Artificial light is only seen in the houses of the rich, where small petroleum lamps are used. Clothes come almost entirely from Aden.— 11 litive le or The local manufactures are few and unimportant. Certain tribes make their own goat-hair tents and saddles; saddle-bags and leathern belts are usually home-made. L he Riial el-M'a are known for their straw-woven articles, suc h as matting, baskets, and hats {toffush), which are large y worn by the women of Asir. Most of the swords and long curved knives (jemdbih) are finished locally, the steel being imported from Aden and worked into shape by the loca^ smiths. The A1 el-Yazid section of the Beni Mugheid are noted for their skill in this manufacture. Arms and aim- munition of course come exclusively from abroad but t BeniShihir are said to produce an inferior W °f po^dem The rifles are badly treated, the sights being knocked oh and the stocks pared down.

Cultivation in the Tihamah is dependent partly on the local rainfall and partly on the water from the wadis which come down in flood from the hills. In all the larger wadi beds dams are made and the water led off in channels on to the surrounding land. In most places there are two harvests, the spring and the summer, but the Hali District produces three. The principal crops are two varieties of millet {dukhn and dura), sesame, cotton, and the more common , kinds of native vegetables. The most productive regions are between Hali and Qunfudah and Mikhlaf el-Yemen. Inland, in the hills and plateaux, dura and bersim are grown during the winter ; the summer crops are wheat, barley, lentils, potatoes, and onions. W ada f a produces grapes in large quantities, which are converted into raisins and sold throughout Asir; and in the Beni Malek country and Ebhah, grapes, apricots, and a poor sort of olives are grown. Coffee is cultivated by the Rijal el-JVUa, by the Balasmar round Jebel Hadah, and by the Beni Mugheid near Sijam and Reida, but not in quantities sufficient for local con sumption. Dates are grown in a few places on the coast such as Birk, but by far the largest production is in the fertile valley of Bishah, where lemons, oranges, and dukhn are also cultivated- extensively. Inland Asir is richer than the Tihama h, and the Main Ridge in the centre and south is almost uniformly productive. The best districts are Rijal el-M f a, Temniah, Barak, Ebhah. and Tanumah.VII.—LIVE-STOCK. The Tihamah produces cattle, sheep, goats, and camels in large numbers. Donkeys of a big white breed are used m riding, and there is also a smaller type gie&gt; m 'j j for carrying burdens.

Qunfudah, Birk, Shukeik, Jeizan, and Midi are the five ports through which goods enter Asir. Qunfudah is chiefly used for supplying Turkish needs there and at Ebhah. I he most valuable trade is in arms and ammunition. The Idrissi has his own agents, who bring direct to Jeizan iiom Jibuti, and the Zubeid supply part of northern Asir with rifles from Rueis near Jiddah; but by far the largest part of the trade is in the hands of the Rijal el-M c a, who were the original pioneers and have admitted no rivals in their central and inland spheres. The rifles are a hetero geneous collection, .Mausers, Martinis, Italian makes and Russian, anything in fact which finds its way to Jibuti. Next in importance is the trade from Aden. The Asiri’s necessities are few and the import list is the re foie short. C otton piece-goods, steel, sugar, petroleum, rice, and cooking utensils are the chief items. At the present time trade with Asir is under strict control and is restricted to Jeizan. Interport trade from Habil to Birk is allowed under certain conditions. 2.—Import Trade by Land. biom the south, practically the only commodity which enters Asir is coffee. This is chiefly produced round Jebel Razih and taken in by the pilgrim road to the Qahtan countiy, where it is bought up by the Qahtan merchants at Khaims 'Abidah. The imports from the Hejaz are still more limited and seem to be confined chiefly to copper coffee-pots. 3.—Export Trade. I he export trade is only carried on at present on a small scale, but is capable of considerable development.— 15 — five The Tihamah exports to Jiddah wheat, dukhn, dura, simsim, and dried fish, chiefly in the pilgrim season. 1 he remainder of the exports go either to Aden or Massowa. These consist of semin, skins, and wool, both from the Tihamah and inland; cotton from the Hah district, Com mits from the Munjahah, gum from the Shahran and Qahtan, dates from Bishah, and honey from the Bijal el-M a Cattle are also exported to Massowah, when the absence of cattle plague permits. , , 0 Merchants from the Hadramaut control most of the general trade, both import and export, with the outside world. The Rijal el-M'a also take their share^ though they reserve themselves chiefly for the arms traffic, am nerc are a few Indian traders. 4.—Internal Trade. In all the main necessities of life each tribal district is self-supporting. The chief distributing centres of what to the Asiri are luxuries, are: Sabiyah (Mikhlaf el-Yemen), Sheibein, and Rijal (Rijal el-M'a), Ebhah (Beni Mugheid), Khamis Mishait (Shahran), Khaims Abida ( Abida Qahtan), Kiad (Hali District), Sabt Ibn eh Anf (Ben Shihir), Khamis el-Makwar (Ghamid), Dus (Zahran), am Qunfudah (Beni Zeid). . . . , , , . ^ Most of the output of dates from Bishah is brought to Khamis Mishait for distribution by merchants, who go to Bishah early in the season well supplied with general goods, such as rifles, ammunition, coffee, piece goods, etc. Mer chants from Sabiyah procure all their horses from the ^ Wada'a produces raisins and sends them chiefly to Khamis Abidah. . . After the Rijal el-M'a the most enterprising traders ot the interior are the Qahtan, and especially the Ruieidet el-Yemen section of that tribe. it.— IX.—CURRENCY. The only coins in universal use throughout Asir are the Thilth Abu Howtah, a small nickel coin worth half a Turkish piastre, and the Maria Theresa dollar, locally called Rial Fransah and valued at twelve Turkish piastres. In and around Ebhah and Qunfudah the ordinary Turkish coins are in circulation, viz. one Turkish piastre, two Turkish piastres, beshlik (2f Turkish piastres), quarter mejidi (5 Turkish piastres), half mejidi (10 Turkish piastres), mejidi (20 Turkish piastres), and golden lira (110 Turkish piastres) ; but they do not pass elsewhere, with the exception of the lira, and even that is regarded with suspicion. English sovereigns (known as Abu Khaial) are more popular and are current at 120 Turkish piastres in most places. In the Tihamah, especially in the south, two-anna and one-anna pieces (both known as Abu Surah) are found and are valued at two Turkish piastres and one Turkish piastre respectively. The rupee, however, has not been introduced. In many places in Asir barter is the chief medium of exchange.— 17 — X.—WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. 2 the dsh y arv tre. rter es), isli ion ore oat nd ad re d. of In Qunfudah and Ebhah the Turks have introduced their own standards of weights and measures. In the mountainous districts wooden bowls of certain standard sizes are employed for dry commodities according to the following table :—- 3 ofres = 1 mid 4 mids = 1 sah 3 sahs = 1 farraj Bowls representing halves and eighths of sahs aie also used. In the Tihamah the scale is slightly different in nomen clature, viz. :—• 4 0 k e s — 1 keila 3 keilas = 1 sah 3 sahs = 1 farraj These measures of content are chiefly employed in the big market places. Elsewhere the practice seems to consist simply in placing a commodity in small piles (aqwdm) and making a rough calculation of its bulk. Land is measured as follows, the feddan being somewhat smaller than the Egyptian feddan :— 2 fellejs = 1 rakib 4 rakibs = 1 zahab 2 zahabs = 1 feddan— 18 — XL—TAXES. 1.—Idrissi Area. In the Tihamah the Idrissi levies taxes on all the inhabi tants from the Beni 'Abs in the south to the Zubeid in the north, with the exception of the pro-Turkish tribes of Beni YaTah and Beni Zeid round Qunfudah. Inland he levies on all the Qahtan tribes, Bahr Ibn Skreinah, Er-Raish, A1 Musah (some sections only), Balasmar, Beni Amr, Bulqarn, Rabi'yet et-Tahahin, and the Barak tribes when Turkish influence among these is weak. Some of the other tribes, such as the Rijal el-M'a, Zahran, and Rabi'yet el- Yemen, refuse to be regarded as tax payers, but send the Idrissi occasional presents and help him in war. The taxes are a grain tax of one mid in twelve, payable at the end of each harvest, and a herd tax of one per cent in the case of sheep and two per cent in the case of cattle and camels. The sheikhs of tribes are primarily responsible for the col lection ; but the Idrissi also has travelling inspectors, who are always men of importance and generally of Sherifial stock. The grain and animals are sold at once and the proceeds sent to Sabiyah. Import and Export Dues .—The Idrissi has his customs' officers at all his ports, who collect dues on the following scale :— Imports :— 15 Turkish piastres on case of sugar. 6 35 ,, on sack of rice. 50 33 ,, on bale of piece goods. 33 ,, on tin of petroleum. 1 33 piastre on each rifle. 20 33 piastres on box of ammunition.Exports :—• 5 Turkish piastres on tin of semin. 3 „ „ on sack of dates. 5 ,, „ on bale of hides. 3 „ ,, on bale of gum. 1 „ piastre on sack of dura, dukhn, and sesame. Market fees at all the chief markets are collected as follows :— | Turkish piastre on each sheep sold. 1 „ „ on each camel, donkey, or cow. 1 „ „ on each keila of wheat or other cereal. 2 ,, piastres on each tin of semin. 2 ,, ,, on each tin of honey. Slaughtering Dues. —Two Turkish piastres for each animal. There are no ground rents, but coffee sellers pay two Turkish piastres each market day, and petty traders half a Turkish piastre. 2.—Turkish Area. The Turks levy taxes on the Beni Zeid and Beni Ya'lah round Qunfudah and on the Beni Mugheid, Alqam el-Hul, Beni Malek, Ttabi'yah wa Rufeidah (part), Shahran (part), and Rufeidet el-Yemen (one section) round Ebhah. No details are available, but they are said not to be severe. 3.—Independent Area. The tribes such as the Rijal el-M'a, Ghamid, Shahran, and Zahran, and certain other smaller tribal units, are accustomed to pay taxes to their chief sheikhs. These are partly to enable their leaders to meet the many calls which are made upon their hospitality, but chiefly to create a reserve for the purchase of rifles and ammunition in case of war.— 20 — XIL—RECENT HISTORY AND PRESENT POLITICS. Politically Asir cannot be regarded as one, except on the Ottoman theory that it forms, as a whole, the northern sub-province or sanjak of the Vilayet of Yemen. In reality it falls into four parts, one completely independent and three acknowledging, respectively, the influence of the Sherif of Mecca, the Turks, or the Idrissi. The three latter, it is hardly necessary to remark, are constantly changing as the power of one or the other aspirants to supremacy waxes or wanes. (1) The number of Arabs who recognize no power but their own is comparatively small and is confined almost entirely to nomad tribes such as the Rabi 'yah Mujatrah and Rabi'yet et-Tahahin, who dwell in inaccessible mountain country on the 'Aqabah, and to nomad sections of certain of the eastern tribes such as the Ghamid, Shahran, and 'Abidah. who wander far out to the east, where they are beyond control. There is no cohesion or fixed purpose amongst these, and politically they are of little account. (2) The Sherif of Mecca's influence is chiefly evident amongst the powerful tribes of Ghamid, Beni Shihir, and Shahran, who live on the inland side of the Main Ridge. He is connected by marriage with the paramount chief of the Beni Shihir and is a personal friend of the Ghamid and Shahran sheikhs; but he has never made any attempt to administer the country, and it is doubtful if he has] much influence amongst the tribesmen. In 1910 he got into touch with many of the tribes between Lith and Ebhah, during his campaign against the Idrissi; but how far he has maintained relations since then is a matter of speculation.The Turks have never succeeded in- completely subduing Asir, and they now have only a precarious hold on the port of Qunfudah and the inland towns of Muhail and Ebhah, with a small district round each of these places, and, intermittently, the roads from one to the other They are in touch with the Beni Shehir and Shahran, but chiefly bv virtue of their relations with the Sherd ; m the event of trouble with the latter it is probable that they would find these tribes arrayed against them. (41 As for what remains, the Idrissi either administers or federates it, that i,, the Qahtan tr*es of southern inland Asir and most of the Tihamah and Aqabah from the \\ adi 'Ain in the south to the confines of lath, a strip of near '■ 350 miles from north to south by roughly seven y roai.

Before Mohammed 'Ali cast covetous eyes ™ Asu, the whole country from Dahran almost to Tad was m the hands of the ruling'family of Beni Mugherd, whose capital was Manadir, or Ebhah as it is now called. The tor at the tame of the Egyptian expedition m 1834 was A idh I bn M , who. with the help of his sturdy hill-men succeeded in defeatinn the invaders.

There is in Mikhlaf el-Yemen a very old tradition of independence which has been maintained against both the lurks and the Yemenite tribes on the one hand, and the tribes of the inland mountains on the other. Between 1830 and 1840 Abu 'Arish was ruled by a certain Sherif 'Ali, \\ ho made terms with the Egyptians in order to free himself a- 0 ] 1 - 11 * i' 16 ^ m ' r 4'^ Ikn Mura'i. During his reign one oidi Ahmed el Idrissi, a native of Fez, and head of a religious fraternity school (tarika), which he had preached in a school at Mecca since D99, acquired land at Sabiyah, settled there and died (1837) in the odour of sanctity. 'He had been the teacher of the original Senussi, who took the covenant in Ins tanka in 1823. The Idrissi family increased in wealth ( urmg the lifetime of Sidi Ahmed's son and grandson, and appears, after the renunciation of Asir by the Egyptians in 1 . 5 have supplanted the Sherifial family of Abu 'Arish. 11 intermarried with the Senussi house, settled in Cyrenaica, and had branches at Zeinia near Luxor in Egypt, and in the Sudan at Argo. But the expansion of its political power to include not only all Mikhlaf el-Yemen, but the Tihamah and Aqabah north and south and a suzeraintv over several tribes outside those limits {e.g. in the Sada district and even among the tribes of North Yemen) is the work of Sidi t i • 8 g rea t-grandson, Seyyid Mohammed, the present El-idns. Born at Sabiyah in 1876, educated partly in Egypt (at /(mua and at El-Azhar, Cairo), and partly by the Senussi vi ^ a ^ er res Mence at Argo and marriage, Seyyid Mohammed returned to Sabiyah determined to render Asir m ependent of the lurks and to aggrandize himself at their expense. By 1910 he had driven them back to their present .loldmg, but he failed to take Ebhah against opposition organized by the Grand Sherif. Subsidized and supplied by the Italians during the Tripolitan War, he consolidatedhimself in the south, and though the Grand Sherd seduced much of his following after the Peace of Ouchy, he recovers himself during the Balkan War. Failing, m 1914, to secure recognition from the Young Turks as more than a kaimakam of Sabivah and Abu 'Arish, he declared definitely against them on their entry into the present struggle, signed a treaty with our Resident at Aden in May 1915, and took the fieid in June with a following of some 12,000 men from Mikhlaf el-Yemen and certain tribes of the 'Aqabah and Tihamah and the Qahtan. He has not succeeded, however, m taking Loheiah, though he has overrun much of the Northern Tihamah of Yemen, and raised part of the Zaramk and other Tihamah tribes against the Turks. His power rests large y on his personality, but to some extent also on hereditary sanctity and on the wealth and influence of his connexions, notably those with the Senussi. His most implacable foe, after theTurks, is the Imam of Yemen, and the only poten tate really friendly to him in Arabia is Ibn oaud. e Grand Sherif, however, is now disposed to keep on terms and is anxious to reconcile the differences between him and the Imam Yehya. ^ , A These differences, founded on jealousy and accentuated by personal dislike, are probably too deep-seated to admit of more than a temporary settlement. In his early days the • Idrissi was fully occupied in consolidating his newly won position; and in any case his schemes of expansion were directed northwards amongst the Sunni tribes of Asir rather than eastwards to the Zeidi followers of the Imam. Indeed the Imam, by his opposition to the Turks, was a source of strength, and the interests of the two chiefs were so far identical six years ago that they entered into a de fensive alliance, after delimiting their respective boundaries. The Idrissi was faithful to the pact, but the Imam, having failed to avert the relief of Sana'a and attracted by the favourable terms offered to him, abandoned his ally and submitted to the Ottoman forces. The Idrissi has never forgiven him for this and has always refused to listen to— 24: ~ any proposals for a reconciliation. He has gone further and for some years has been actively endeavouring to under mine the loyalty of the Imam’s western tribes. He was fortunate in finding a favourable field for intrigue amongst the powerful confederation of the Hashid, which had bitterly resented the peace proceedings at Da'an in l.lll, and he has succeeded in keeping them estranged till the present time. In 1913, in consequence of com plaints from the inhabitants, he sent an expeditionary force to Jebel Razih, which lies between Abu 'Arish and Sa'adah, and has since administered that district. At the present time he is credited with the ambition to extend his dominions still fin ther at the expense of the Imam. He is in com munication with most of the important Sheikhs of the Northern Yemen, who are said to be ready to rise if ade quately financed and armed. Whether the influence of the Sherif of Mecca is sufficiently great to induce him to foiego these ambitions is a matter of speculation, but it (an at least be said that the Imam’s rupture with the fuiks is a necessary preliminary and that the Idrissi is in a position to drive a harder bargain than in 1910.XIII.—MILITARY ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES. 1.—Turkish. The Turkish forces in Asir consist of the 21st Independent Division, commanded by Muhieddin Bey and composed of the following units :— Infantry Regt. No. 118 (1 battalion). ,, 121 (3 battalions), O.C. Assim Bey. „ „ 122 ( „ ), O.C. Eaizi Bey. „ „ 123 ( „ ), O.C. c Ali Rida Bey. The 123rd Regiment seems to have been formed shortly before the war. The battalion of the 118th arrived in Asir from Yemen in the autumn of 1913. Companies are about 160 strong and the total force was estimated at about 6,000 in November 1915. It is divided between Qunfudah and Ebhah, with a prepon derance at the latter place. In 1914 there was also a strong post at Muhail, but it is not known whether this is still held. There are also the following Corps troops :—- Four mountain batteries. Two machine gun companies. One train company. One telegraph company. Four Mantelli 7'5-centimetre guns at Ebha. In addition to the above there are four companies of locallv recruited foot-gendarmes - and one company of mounted gendarmes. The Turks can also count upon the support of the tribes in the immediate neighbourhood of the places which they— 26 — hold. Round Qunfudah they have the Beni Zeid andt he Beni Ya'lah, neither of them fighting tribes, but, as they showed in 1910, quite ready to take up arms against the Idrissi. The Turkish hold on Muhail is precarious, as they only have a section of the A1 Musa with them, and it is probable that they would abandon this place, if indeed they have not already done so, in the event of a genuine attack by the Idrissi. Round Ebhah their position is stronger. By intermarriage and the grant of civil honours to its principal Sheikhs they have gained the support of the powerful tribe of the Beni Mugheid and they can also count on the 'Alqam el-Hul and 5 the Beni Malek. Their influence extends also to some of the Shahran and Beni Shihir; but these tribes aie moie particular!v faithful to the Sherif of Mecca and would not assist the Turks except against the Idrissi, and only then if the latter were still at enmity with the Sherif. 2.—Idbissi. The Idrissi’s standing army consists of about 500 Sudanese recruited from the villages round his capital, Sabiyah, and chiefly used for police work or as his personal guard in normal times. In times of war he depends entirely on the tribes for support. His system_is simple. He has about ten maqadim or generals, almost invariably chosen from the leading families of Sa'adah (Seyyids) or Ashraf (Sherifs), each of whom is entrusted with a district or a group of tribes with which he is required to keep in touch at all times. When troops are required, each general is ordered to produce a specified number of men and he in turn makes the tribal sheikhs responsible for carrying out the order. Exemption is purchased by the payment of twenty-four rials. The army thus formed is a conglomeration of small bands, skilled in tribal warfare but untrained and undisciplined according to European standards, and generally divided against itself by petty tribal quarrels and jealousies. Eachtribal unit brings its own food and as many rifles as it can, and the Idrissi is responsible for making up the number and for supplying ammunition. In addition, he has to make handsome presents to all the chief sheikhs. Unless there is a good prospect of loot, it is difficult to collect the Arabs in any numbers, and in any case their natural independence and their dislike of restraint render them unsuitable for a long campaign. This and their disinclination to face modern artillery were among the chief causes which led to their failure before Loheiah in 1915. The Idrissi is poorly supplied with artillery and its ammunition and with trained men to serve the guns. Theoretically he can put a very large army into the field, but in practice he probably cannot muster more than 25,000 men for offensive purposes. He is hampered by the fact that the tribes refuse to go far from their own boundaries and therefore he has to depend on the material available in the particular district in which he is operating.XIV.—TRIBAL NOTES. 1.—TRIBES OF THE MARITIME PLAIN FROM LITH TO LATITUDE 16° (WADI 'AIN) DHUWWI HASSAN. Occupy the coast, from just north of Lith to Hamdh, a distance of about forty-five miles, and inland to the beginning of the mountains, which are here only a few miles from the sea. They are of Sherifial stock, but are irreligious and piratical, with a bad name all along the coast. They are friendly with the Zahran and Jehadlah, their eastern and northern neighbours, but have a long-stand mg feud with the Dhuwwi Barakat, who lie to their south. The Turks, who maintain a garrison at Lith, exercise a certain restraint over the Dhuwwi Hassan and the Sherif of Mecca sends a representative to collect what tithes he can. They are, however, thoroughly impatient of any control and what little deference they show to any one is paid to the Idrissi, who is sufficiently far away to appear attractive. The Dhuwwi Hassan possess many slaves and the cruelty with which they are treated is notorious. Blacks captured at sea are invariably enslaved and hamstrung to minimize their chance of escape. Their chief settlement is Lith, a small fishing village composed of a few mud huts, Turkish barrack, blockhouse, and mosque ; only supplies available are a few sheep and fowls. Port of call for Austrian Lloyd steamers. Chief Sheikh, Sherif Mohammed Ibn Hassan Ibn el- l d, a notorious pirate. Fighting strength, 3,000 men. Clans : A1 Asaf, El-Khumjan, A1 Hassan Ibn Ahmed, A1 j isas.DHUWWI BARAKAT. From just south of Hamdh to 'Uruj, a distance of about twenty-two miles, and inland for about fourteen miles. Bounded on the north by the Dhuwwi Hassan ; east by the Zahran and Zubeid ; and south by the Zubeid. They are of Sherifial stock, but, like the Dhuwwi Hassan, with whom they are always at feud, are piratical and lawless, are friendly with the Zubeid, the Zahran, and a section of the ' Abadlah Ashraf, who live in their country. An offshoot of the tribe lives at Manadil in the Bela ir country. Chief Sheikh, Sherif Hassan Mandil, who is independent of all outside influence. Fighting strength, 400 men. Clans : Manadil, Hawatimah, Ruwajihah. ZUBEID. A detached offshoot of the Harb, numbering about 15,000 men: hospitable, well-conducted, and brave. Then boun dary starts from the sea near 'Uruj and runs along the southern and eastern boundary of the Dhuwwi Barakat until the Zahran are reached. From there it goes parallel to the coast, about thirty miles inland, along the confines of the Zahran, Ghamid, Bala'rian, and Beni Shihir succes sively till it reaches a point due east of Qunfudah. 1 hence it follows the boundaries of the Bala'ir and Beni Zeid till it reaches the sea about seven miles north of Quntudah. The Zubeid are settled and agricultural and rich m cattle. Their land is barren near the sea, but increasingly rich as one goes inland. All the tribesmen are strongly m favour of the Idrissi and pay him taxes. They are equally strong in their feelings against the Turks, who, in spite of proximity, have not ventured to interfere with them for years. 1 heir chief enemies are the Beni Shihir, but they dislike and despise the Beni Zeid. They are friendly towards the30 — Dhuwwi Barakat, the Ghamid, and the Zahran. The Zubeid engage in the gun-running trade to a certain extent, bringing their rifles from Rueis, near Jiddah, or from Birk, and selling them chiefly to the Zahran. The paramount Sheikh is Mu'addi Ibn Kheir. The sub-tribes are A1 Kheir, Beni Zibda, A1 es-Sa iida, A1 Imlahi, Beni Etmah, A1 Sula'bah, A1 Difrah, A1 Mashaf, A1 Jamil, El-'Ajalein. BENI ZEID. The Beni Zeid boundary starts seven miles north of Qunfudah and marches inland with that of the Zubeid for about ten miles. Thence keeping always equidistant from the coast, it follows the Zubeid confines for about twelve miles and then those of the BeTair for about twenty-three miles. Then it turns west to the sea along the Beni Y'ala line, about twenty-five miles south of Qunfudah. The Beni Zeid are faithful friends of the Turks. They are peace-loving and unwarlike and despised by the fighting tribes on that acount; but nevertheless they held firm in .1910 when the Idrissi marched on Qunfudah and rendered a good account of themselves. They are on terms of enmity with their neighbours the BeTair and El-'Umur, and are raided by such distant tribes as the Beni ’ Aissa, Dhuwwi Barakat, and Dhuwwi Hassan, who slip through the Zubeid country and back again before they can be brought to book. The Zubeid tolerate them and they are allied with the Beni Y'ala. Paramount Sheikh, Hassan Ibn Khidr. (a) Nomads .—Clans : Rabi'yah Weina and Marahibah, 3,000 men. Rich in camels and chief carriers to Muhail, Hali, and Barak. They supply Qunfudah with milk. (b) Settled. —4,000 men. Agricultural, living chiefly round Qunfudah. They own good cultivation {dura and vegetables) and a large stock of cattle and sheep.Chief town:— Qunfudah. A small walled town in a bay protected by an island, about 200 miles south of Jiddah. It is the port for Ebhah (q.v.). The population is between 2,000 and 8,000. There is a small Turkish garrison. Water is brought from wells at Hafair, two hours away. About one-third of the houses are built of stone and there are five mosques. The Government houses are in a fort outside the town. Plentiful supplies can be obtained in the neighbourhood. The chief Beni Zeid villages are El-Ja'a, El-Zeialah, Es- S'ada, El-Mashaikh, and Rahman. BEL AIR. A strong truculent tribe, with a good fighting reputation, which inhabits the country between the lines Khabt el- 'Umur to Juma'at Rabi'yah on the Hali-Muhail road, and Habil to Joz BeTair on the Qunfudah-Barak road. Bounded on the north and north-east by the Zubeid, east by the Rabi'yah Mujatra, south-east by the Rabi'yet et-Tahahin, south by the Awlad el-'Alownah, and west by the Beni Zeid. Their country runs from the plain into the first foothills, and they are rich in camels, goats, and cattle, and own good cultivation. They are friendly with the Zubeid, but generally at loggerheads with their other neighbours. Their situation astride the two main roads between Qunfudah to Muhail is an excellent one for raiding and full advantage is taken of it. A colony of 300 Dhuwwi Barakat, who have long lived at Manadil, have a specially bad reputation for raiding. Divisions are :— 1. Nawasherah. 3,000 men, settled and nomadic. Chief Sheikh, Ibn Kheirah. 2. El-'Umur. 4,000 men, entirely nomadic. Chief Sheikh, Mohammed Ibn ' Abdu.Formerly the paramount Sheikh over both was c Air Ibn Medini, wlio lost most of his power by seceding to the Sherif of Mecca in 1910. Now he only influences the villagers of Joz Bel'air and two small Nawasherah clans. The rest of the tribe is anti-Turk and pro-Idrissi and Ibn Kheirah has largely taken 'Ali Ibn Medini’s place. The chief villages are Joz Bel’air. About seventeen miles due west of Qunfudah, at the junction of the Qunfudah-Barak and Qunfudah-Muhail roads, in the valley of the fertile Wadi Mishrif. It consists of about 800 straw huts and is the seat of a Turkish markaz. Sabat el-'Umur. A fair-sized village twelve miles south-west of Joz BeTair, where a market is held every Wednesdav. Other villages are El-Firshah, El Muja'adah, Heil el- Muja'adah, El-Habil, Es-S c adah, and Shei' el-'Umur. BENI Y ALA. A small settled tribe numbering 500 men, living along the coast a few miles north of Kali. Bounded on the north by the Beni Zeid, on the east by the Awlad el-'Alownah, and on the south by the Shawa'rah (Kenanah). They are unwar like and cowardly and are raided at intervals by the Bel air and the Hali tribes. They are allied with the Beni Zeid. Chief Sheikh, Beitali Abu 'Atanah ; pro-Turk. Small section under Sheikh Bahran of Shijafah ; ^ pro- Idrissi. Their chief villages are Y'ebah, Sabt Beni \'ala, El-'Arja', Shijafah, Kidwah, El-Melahah, and Nikhl. AHL HALI (or Tribes of the Hali District). A federation of four tribes of differing origin, the 'Abid el-Emir, El-Ghawanimah, Awlad el-'Alownah, and Kenanah, inhabiting the fertile district of Hali.— 33 — 3 Range from four miles north of Hali Point to eighteen miles south along the coast and inland to a distance of twenty miles north-north-east of Hali Point, the boundary narrowing as it approaches its southern limit. Bounded on the north-west by the Beni Y'ala, north by the Bel'air, north-east by the Rabi'yet et-Tahahin, and east by the Beni Hilal. The federation is brave and warlike and at feud with all its neighbours, the Rijal el-M a being the only tribe which it regards with friendly eyes. Internally its relations are at times strained, but it unites for common defence or at the summons of the Idrissi. The Turks used to occupy Hali, but lost it sixteen years ago and have failed to regain a footing. Paramount Sheikh over all is Ibn ' Aji of the Awlad el- 'Alownah. The tribes are :—- 1 'Abid el-Emir. To the north-west on the Hali-Muhail road, 600 men. Chief Sheikh, Ibn Saghair. Nomad clan, Salalma. Originally slaves of Sudanese blood, but the tribe has long since won its emancipation by itb bravery and ranks on an equality with the Arabs. The chief villages are Kiad and Sabt el-Kiad. 2. Ghawanimah. From Radhah to Khei along the Muhail road to the west of the 'Abid el-Emir. All settled. 1 500 men. Chief Sheikh, Khalil el-Ghanim. Their chief villages are El-Khe'i, Kidwet el-Ghawanimah, and El- Radhah. 3. Awlad el-Alownah. In the north from Kidwah to Miniiyah. All settled except one clan, the Fillahah. 3 000 men. Chief Sheikh, Hassan Shijeifi. Their villages are * Minjiyah, El-B'aishi, Ei-Ferik, El-Fiqahah, El-Masha- rikh, Es-Salamah, and 'Ajam Jeeirah. 4. Kenanah. From Minjiyah to the southern boundary.A tribe famous in history. Chief sections are * (i) Shaw'arah. 1,000 men. Chief Sheikh, Mohammed Ibn 'Abd. Their villages are Kidwat el-'Abid, El-Beidein, Makhshush, and Qadab. (ii) Beni Yehya. 400 men. Chief Sheikh, Sheikh Abu Radiah. Their villages are, Sulb el-Ma'ashiah, Al-Khirshan, and Melba. BENI HILAL. The Beni Hilal boundary starts at Sabt es-Sawala, twenty- three miles east of Hah, and runs just north of the Sikket es- Sheraf and Wadi Dofa'a up to within four miles of Muhail, a distance of about thirty-four miles. Tribes to the north are the Rabriyet et-Tahahin and A1 el-Dreib. From Sirr, near Muhail, the boundary goes south-west to Birk, march ing successively with the A1 Musa, Bahr Ibn Skeinah, and Munjahah. The coast is the Beni Hilal’s for about eighteen miles north of Birk, and then the boundary turns inland and so up to Sabt es-Sawala along the Hali border. The country is densely wooded and mountainous in parts and provides pasturage for large herds of camels and goats. The chief sections are :— 1. Ahl Birk. Numbering, with the western nomads, 7,000 men. The Ahl Birk inhabit the villages along the sea coast such as Nakhl el-Birk, Nahud, and Sobakhah, and form the only law-abiding section of the tribe. They culti vate a little, grow dates in some of the villages, and collect and sell salt. Their Chief Sheikh is Mohammed Ibn 'Abdu, who is nominally paramount Sheikh of the whole tribe. His brother 'Ali Ibn 'Abdu is Sheikh of Birk. The Ahl Birk all pay taxes to the Idrissi.35 — 2. A1 Ikhtarsh. With sub-sections A1 Misfar and A1 Um Jema'a. 5,000 men. A savage and truculent tribe of nomads, almost pagan and at daggers drawn with all their neighbours, except the Rijal el-M'a, of whom they are afraid. They have closed the Sikket es-Sheraf to the Turks and rendered it unsafe for any but large caravan parties. The allegiance which they pay to the Idrissi is only nominal. Mohammed Ibn Hassan is their Chief Sheikh, a notorious highwayman. Chief village :— Birk. Consisting of about 150 stone houses and some straw huts. Surrounded by a ruined wall. Good water. •Harbour with good shelter from all winds. Chief port for the import and export trade of southern inland Asir and the main centre of the arms’ traffic. MUNJAHAH. Occupy the sea coast and a few miles inland from just south of Birk almost to Shukeik, a distance of about forty- five miles. Bounded on the north by the Beni Hilal, east bv the Rijal el-M'a, and south by the district of Mikhlaf el-Yemen. (а) Settled. —1,000 men. Inhabiting the small ports of Qahmah, Wasm, Khasa'a, Raqabah, and Wahlah. They have a little cultivation, and a few date trees, and eke out their existence by working as porters in their own villages and at Birk. These villages, though small, are important as being the chief inlets for arms and ammunition. The Munjahah pay taxes to the Idrissi. Their Chief Sheikh is 'Ali Ibn Fa'i who lives at Wasm. (б) Nomads. —5,000 men. Chief Sheikh, Mohammed Ibn Zeid. Chief sub-tribes are: A1 Um Khareis, A1 Abdiyah, A1 Zeid, A1 Um Hadish, A1 Sariyeh, A1 es-Shihbi, and Walad Islam.— 36 — The nomads are fairly well off for sheep and camels. They sell dried fish in the interior and also export dom-nuts to Massowah. Before the Idrissi reduced them to order, they were notorious for their treachery and acts of law lessness both by land and sea. Even now their guests are wont to sleep with their rifles by their sides. The nomads are disliked by all the surrounding tribes, but in normal times they wander out of their country to that of the Bahr I bn Skeinah and Beni Hilal. They never go south of Shukeik, having no wish to come into closer contact with the Idrissi than is necessary. MIKHLAF EL-YEMEN. The district of Mikhlaf el-Yemen includes all the Tihamah from Shukeik in the north to Wadi 'Ain in the south. As the tribal boundaries are not so distinct here as elsewhere in Asir—indeed the central district cannot be considered in any sense tribal—it has been divided into the northern, central, and southern districts, a purely arbitrary distinction made for convenience of description. A. —Northern District. 1. Beni Sh'ibah. (a) Settled Section. —1,000 men. Occupying half a dozen villages near the Khor el-Itwid, of which the chief are El- 'Askar and Ed-Darb. They are purely agricultural. (b) Nomad Portion. —A1 Hadrah and A1 Hassan. 2,500 men. Living chiefly round Khor el-Itwid and up the Wadi Dhil'a to the Rabi'yet el-Yemen boundary. They are rich in camels, cattle, sheep, and horses, and nearly always fight on horseback. The tribe is mixed, the Sheikhs and chief families being Arabs, the rest Sudanese who have been emancipated for many generations. They are excellent fighters and are generally known as the 'asakir, or soldiers. The whole tribe pays taxes to the Idrissi. They are friendly with the— 37 Munjahah, Rijal el-M'a, and the rest of Mikhlaf el-Yemen, but are hereditary enemies of the Rabi'yet el-\emen and generally on bad terms with the Beni Mugheid. Their paramount Sheikh is Ibrahim Abu Ma^ammed. 2. Naj'u. An entirely nomadic tribe, numbering about 6,000 men, and inhabiting the country between Sabiyeh and the Beni Sh'ibah. They possess small herds of camels and goats and, although numerous, are of little political importance, being poor fighters and possessing no cohesion. They earn their living chiefly by selling milk and semin in Sabiyeh. Their Chief Sheikh is Mohammed Ibn Mus'ai. The tribe pays taxes regularly to the Idrissi. The chief subdivisions are the Beni Mohammed (not connected with the Beni Mohammed further south), El- Hajowi or Haju, and Beni Mufurrih. Chief village : Shukeik. A small Idrissi port about latitude 17° 45 . Mixed mercantile population, chiefly engaged in the hide and semin trade with Massowa. Population about 1,000. B.— Central District. The central district may be taken as extending from Urn el-Khashab in the north to just south of Abu 'Ansh. It is traversed by four wadis, the Wadi Beish in the north, in which are the villages of Musliyeh, Urn el-Khashab, and Dahnah; the Wadi Sabiyeh, in which are Sabiyeh and the villages of El-Husseini, Shukheirah, and others; the Wadi Dhomad, with the villages of Khudeirah, Ed-Dhomad, El- Khumri, and El-Harjah ; and the Wadi Jeizan, m which are the town of Abu 'Arish and the villages of El-Washi, El- Makhaderah, El-Ujdah, and Hakimet el-Beid. The Wadi Jeizan joins the Wadi Dhomad at Hafair, the wells of which supply the town of Jeizan. In the fertile hill district to the— 38 north-east of Sabiveh and particularly on the slopes of Jebel Feifah and Jebel Nadir are also to be found small but prosperous communities. The country watered by these wadis is. perhaps, the most densely populated portion of the Asir Tihamah and is of importance as being the chief centre of the Idrissi’s influence. Before his rise to power the villages were a succession of small independent units, each a law to itself, and generally at odds with its neigh bours. The Turks never attempted a proper administration of the country and violence was rife to such a degree that only large armed parties could travel with safety. To-day, however, the district is thoroughly under control and law-abiding. The largest element of the population is of Sudanese blood, partly unemancipated slaves, but chiefly freed-mfen. With these are the Mowallads or Suda nese with an Arab strain, and over them the Arabs of pure blood and the Sa'ada and Ashraf. The Sudanese make excellent fighting material, being more amenable to disci pline than the Arabs. Seyyids and Ashraf are more power ful here than elsewhere in Asir and occupy much of the best land m Wadis Sabiyeh and Dhomad. The only tribal unit is that of the Ja'aferah, who are of Sherifial stock and settled round Joz el-Ja f aferah to the north of Jeizan. They number about GOO men. Chief Sheikh, Sherif Mohammed 'Ali. Chief towns Sabiyeh. About twenty miles inland, north-east of Jeizan. It is the Idrissi’s capital and is a straw-built town with a two-storied “palace” of mud, and a fine mosque. There are numerous villages in the neighbourhood. Popu lation about 10,000 inhabitants. Jeizan. A small port settlement, opposite to the Fersan Islands and the Idrissi’s chief outlet on the sea. Water is scarce. There is a small bazaar, and fresh meat and— 30 vegetables are obtainable at a day’s notice. It was formerly in the hands of the Turks, and their warehouses and markaz are still standing. A rapid, if temporary, growth of the town may be expected, since the trade with Asir is now concentrated there. The Fersan Islands, once desued b\ Germany for a coaling station, are now occupied by a British garrison. Abu 'Arish. A large straw-built village with a few mud houses occupied by Ashraf. about nineteen miles east of Jeizan. Formerly a Turkish markaz. The water supply is good. The population is warlike and can muster about 1,000 fighting men. C.—Southern District. 1. Masarehah. Occupying the country from just, south of Abu 'Arish and Jeizan to Wadi Ta'ashar, and inland to the first foothills. Bounded on the north by the ' Araishi of Abu 'Arish, on the south by the Ja'dah and Beni Marwan, and on the east by the Beni Mohammed. They pay taxes to the Idrissi and can muster about 1,000 fighting men. Chief Sheikhs, Ahmed Masawah, Osman Siwadi, Abu Helim, and Yehya Mihah. Their chief village is Samtah. 2. Ja'dah. A small tribe between the Beni Marwan and Masarehah just south of the Wadi Ta'ashar, about ten miles north of Midi. Chief Sheikhs, Mohammed Ahmed and Maqbul, both of whom have been fighting for the Idrissi. 3 Beni Marwan. Situated south of the 3a dah along the coast to Wadi Hairan and inland to the hills. Bounded on the north by the Ja'dah and Masarehah, on the east by the Khamisin, and on the south by the Bern Hassan. Fighting strength, 1,000 men. The Idrissi has had trouble with them ever since he accepted Italian help; he sent a punitive expedition against Ibn Bakri, their Chief Sheikh, m November 1915.— 40 Chief villages' , Midi. The principal port of the Idrissi after Jeizan, situated in latitude 16° 18'. It is of recent growth and has no permanent buildings or warehouses. Trade to it from Aden is now forbidden owing to its proximity to the Turkish lines. Chief Sheikh is Taher 'Ali. Suq el-Hairan. About eighteen miles inland of Midi, the chief market of the tribe. Haradh. A town about fifteen miles east of Midi, which can muster 700 fighting men. It is not quite clear whether its inhabitants belong to the Beni Marwan, but in any case they are closely allied to them. 4. Beni Hassan. Stretch along the coast between Wadis Hairan and Habl and about twenty miles inland, and are bounded on the north by the Beni Marwan, on the south by the Beni 'Abs, and on the east by the Beni Zeid. They are allied with the Beni 'Abs and muster about 500 fighting men. Chief Sheikhs, Hassan es-Sadd and Mussa Hassan. Chief village :— Manjur. About twenty miles east-south-east of Midi. 5. Beni Zeid. A small tribe numbering about 1,500 souls situated in the hills to the east of the Beni Hassan. They are allied with the Beni Aslam, friendly with the Beni Hassan, whom they inspire with fear, and enemies of the Beni 'Abs. They support the Idrissi. Chief clans are Beni 'Aqal and Beni 'Amer. 6. Beni Aslam. A tribe inhabiting the mountains to the east of Beni 'Abs, bounded on the north by the Khamisin, south by the Beni Nashar, east by the allied Zeidi tribes of— 41 — Beni Jill, Beni Zafer, and Beni 'Aziz. They are good fighting tribes, mustering about 3,000 men, and have lately been lending active assistance to the Idrissi. Ihey are generally at odds with the Beni v Abs, from whom they are separated by the Wadi Ghadir. Chief Sheikh, 'Ali Bedawi. Their chief village is Suq Hariqa. 7. Beni ' Abs. Occupy the sea coast between Wadi Habl and Wadi 'Ain and inland for about twenty-five miles.

I hey can put into the field about 3,000 excellent fighters, and are the Idrissi’s main support in the south. Their Chief Sheikh, Yehya 'Ali Ibn Thawwab. is joint commander of the Idrissi’s second army. The tiibe is agricultural and pastoral and engages in trade to a cei min extent, their chief markets being Suq el-Himari and Suq 'Abs.

The chief divisions are :— BaTarian, 2,500 men, mostly nomad. Beni 'Aissa, 1,200 men, mostly settled. Beni Suleim, 2,000 men, mostly nomad. Beni Suheim, 600 men, mostly nomad. (The above numbers are not reliable.) They appear to be mostly of African extraction and are looked down upon both on this account and because of their lack of religion, which amounts almost to paganism. They are, however, brave and generally at feud with one or other of their neighbours. The Beni Aissa pay a nominal allegi ance to the Idrissi, the remainder are completely independ ent. They appear to live under poorer and more savage conditions than are usual in Asir. Many of them ply the trade of butcher all over the country as far as Muhail and Birk.BULQARN.

Chief Sheikh is Said Ibn Faiz Walad Faiz Ibn Qurum, a relation by marriage of the Sherif of Meccah and one of the most important men in Asir. He has two sons, Faraj Bey Ibn Said, member of the Ottoman Parliament, and Faiz Bey Ibn Said. The family have houses in Constantinople and Mecca and frequently visit those places. (a) Settled. —13,000 men. Chief sub-tribes are : Ka'ab, Beni Kerim, and A1 Abu Jubeis. Strongly pro-Turk and pro-Sherif.

They openly support the Idiissi. The whole tribe is wealthy and well armed and has a (rood fighting reputation. Their political sympathies have made them disliked by other tribes, but they are powerful enough to support whom they choose, and, as has ahe.u \ been said, their allegiance is to the Sherif of Mecca rather than the Ottoman Government. There is little cohesion between the different sections except in the face of a common danger. RABI'YEH MUJATRA. A wild and little-known nomad tribe ranging over the mountains to the east of Qunfudah and bounded on the north bv the Beni Shihir, on the east by the Humeidah, on the south by the Rabi'yet et-Tahahin, and on the westby the Bel'air. They are said to be lighter skinned than most Arabs and to have blue eyes. They are almost pagan and at odds with all the world, except the RabTyet et-Tahahin, who are as savage as themselves. The Idrissi sometimes succeeds in levying taxes on their numerous herds, but his influence over them is onlv nominal. The main Barak-Qunfudah road runs through the middle of their territory for about twenty miles and caravans are continually being raided by their marauding bands. The Turks have always had a great deal of trouble with them and have never succeeded in reducing them to order. AHL BARAK. The Humeidah with the A1 Musa Ibn c Ali, A1 'Isbai, and A1 Jebali, are known collectively in Asir as the Aid Barak, and it is, therefore, convenient to class them together, although they do not form a confederation or trace their descent to the same ancestors. The district of Barak begins about fifteen miles north of Muhail and covers an area of about twenty miles from north to south and thirty miles from east to west. It is level and well watered and extensively cultivated, dura, dukhn, barley, and sesame being the principal crops. There are over fifty stone-built villages in the district. The Beni Shihir lie to the north and east, the Er-Raish, A1 ed-Dreib, and Rabi'yet et-Tahahin to the south, and the Rabi'yet Mujatra to the west. The Emir of the district, by appointment of the Idrissi, is Mohammed Ibn Haiazah. 1. Humeidah. Live in the western part of the district along the Muhail-Qunfudah road from Dhahab to 'Aqabet es-Suhul and extend down the 'Aqabah to Gdiar el-Hindi. Their Chief Sheikh is Mohammed Ibn Haiazah. (a) Settled. —3,000 men. The majority support the Turks.

RABI YET ET-TAHAHIN. Hold the country on either side of the Sikket el-Halawiyeh (Muhail-Qunfudah road) between the villages of M amal Al Ikhleif and Markh, a distance of about thirty miles. They are bounded on the west by the Bel air, on the north bv the Bel'air, Eabi'yeh Mujatrah, and Humeidah on the east by the Al Jebali and the Al ed-Dreib, and on the south bv the Beni Hilal and the Hali tribes. Their country is moun-— 52 — tainous and well wooded and they are rich in camels, goats, and cattle. About 2,000 fighting men. They are entirely nomad, with a contempt for all forms of husbandry, and have made their name a terror to all travellers on the road. They are allied with the Rabi'yeh Mujatrah and the A1 ed- Dreib, and generally on fair terms with the Hali tribes. With the Beni Hilal, BeTair, Humeidah, and A1 Jebali they keep up incessant feuds. The Turks have never been able to do anything with them, but the Tdrissi is able to tax them to a certain extent. AL ED-DREIB. A small tribe, numbering some 800 men, to the north west of Muhail. They occupy about ten miles of the Sikket el-Halawiyeh from Muhail to Qunfudah, between the villages of Turqush and M'amal al Ikhleif, and extend along the Barak road for about five miles north of Musabbah, which is in their territory. They are bounded on the north by the Al Jebali, on the east by the Er-Raish, on the south east by the Al Musa, on the south by the Beni Hilal, and on the west by the Rabi'yet et-Tahahin. They are a good fighting race but are not quarrelsome or bellicose ; the Idrissi, however, frequently incites them to cut Turkish communications. Their country is fertile and they possess many flocks and herds. The Al Musa and Rabi'yet et-Taha hin are friendly to them ; the Al Jebali, Er-Raish, and Beni Hilal as a rule inimical. They have the reputation of being hospitable beyond the ordinary, and travellers can journey without fear in their country. There is a small offshoot of their nomad sub-section, the Al Ikhleif, situated in the Rabi'yeh Mujatrah country near Ghar el-Hindi, who have cut themselves adrift from the main tribe. Their Chief Sheikh is Mohammed Ibn 'Amer. He frequently visits Sabiyeh, and during his absence the tribe is ruled by his sister, 'Abdiyeh, the wife of a Turkish officer, now deceased'.ER-RAISH. A settled tribe, living to the north and north-east of Muhail ; bounded on the north by the A1 Musa Ibn 'Ah and the Shahari section of the Beni Shihir, on the east by the Balasmar on the south by the Beni Thuwwa and A1 Musa, and on the west by the A1 ed-Dreib. Their southern boundary comes to within five miles of Muhail. The country is fairly level, thickly wooded, and with running streams in places. There are two sections 1. Er-Raish. 1,500 men. Chief Sheikh, Mohammed Ibn Muzhar, whose son was killed by the Turks in 1910. Chief villages, Urn Kadus, El-Mineidhir, and El-Hadhan. 2. A1 Meshwal. 1,000 men. Chief Sheikh, 'Ali Ibn Tal'i. Chief villages : Urn Hajjo, Madb'a, and Sakkan er- Raish. . . 1 i The whole tribe supports the Idnssi and pays him taxes They are, however, poor fighters and fared badly agamst the Sherif of Meccah in 1910, when their country was laid Their friends are the Barak tribes, the A1 Musa, Beni Thuwwa, and Rijal el-M'a; their enemies the Balasmar, Beni Shihir, and Balahmar. An isolated colony owns the village of Mandar in the Balasmar country and holds aloof from any hostilities which take place between the two tribes. AL MUSA. The A1 Musa own the town of Muhail and the country round within a radius of from five to ten miles I he tribes which adjoin them are, on the north, the A1 ed-Drmb and Er-Raish, on the east the Er-Raish and Beni Thuwwa on the south the Beni Thnwwa and Bahr Ibn Skeinah, and on the west the Beni Hilal.The tribe is divided as follows :— 1. Al Musa, living in Muhail. —Chief Sheikh, Suleiman Ibn 'Ali. 2,500 men. Chief clans are Um Shehari, Al Ajil, Al Amir, Al Sh'ar, Al Zebah, AlSherifah, El-Qurun, Al Um Khalid. 2. Settled in Villages round Muhail. —400 men. Clans are Um Hamalah, Um Hajaf, Um ' Alamah, Um Ma'ash, Um Dhiss, Al Fahimah, Awlad el-Mashaikh. 3. Nomads round Muhail. —400 men. Divisions are :—■ {a) Um Jirban. Sheikh Mohammed Ibn Ma'addi. (6) Beni Yazid. Sheikh Dhakir Ibn Sh'ar. 4. Nomads near Hali. —500 men. Divisions are Beni Dhib and Sawalahah. They range over the Sikket el- Halawiyeh, near Kiad, and, being separated from the rest of the tribe by the Beni Hilal, have lost all close touch with it. The tribe is mixed, the nomads and a few of the townsmen being of pure Arab blood, the remainder of some African strain. No intermarriage takes place between the two, but otherwise the blacks rank on an equality with the Arabs, by right of valour. The tribe is fairly rich in flocks and herds, and although their country, which stands com paratively low, cannot rival the fertility of the highlands, it nevertheless produces excellent rain crops. Suleiman Ibn Ali, who is by inheritance paramount Sheikh over all the tribe, supports the Turks and has behind him the Um Jirban and about half the villagers. The remainder have broken free under the leadership of Dhakir Ibn Sh ar, and many of them have retired to live at Jannah in the Bahr Ibn Skeinah country, refusing to live at Muhail so long as there is a Turkish post there. From Jannah they carry on a guerilla warfare, closing the roads and cutting off Turkish convoys whenever they can. The tribe has a hereditary feud with the Beni Hilal and Beni— 55 — Tlmwwa. The neighbouring tribes, who are all pro-Idrissi, maintain friendly relations with Dhakir Ibn Sh'ar and his followers. . Chief town Muhail. About sixty-four miles north-north west of Ebha by the shortest route. It is situated in a fertile valley in the central plateau. Supplies are plentiful, but the water is said to cause fever, and the wells at Bir el- Ghalila, about a mile and a half away, are therefore used. The town, which is built with stone, is dominated by the Jebel Shasa'a, on which there is a Turkish fort. About three years ago the Turks also built forts to the north, west, and east of the town. There are four quarters : Er-Rabu a, Sabt el-Makhluta, Sabt A1 Musa, and Jebel Khasa a. Ihe population, not counting the Turkish garrison, is about 9,000. BENI THUWWA. The Beni Thuwwa He to the south of Muhad and are astride the Ebhah-Wadi Tayyah-Muhail road between Butuh and the Wadi Sh'ab el-Aslah, a distance of ten miles, and the Ebhah-Athalif-Muhail road between Jebel Heilah and Husn Beni Thuwwa, a distance of fifteen miles. They own the territory between these roads and, to the north, approach to within five miles of Muhail. The adjoining tribes are the Al Musa and Er-Raish on the north, the Balasmar on the east the Al Nahya and Al Hirith sections of the Rabi yeh wa Rufeidah on the south, and the Bahr Ibn Skemah on the west. They are a bold and fearless tribe who live chiefly by raiding, and only large armed parties can pass throng their country with safety. They have never submitted to Ottoman authority, and, since the rise of the Idrissi, have become quite out of hand. Their friends are the Rpal el- M a and the Balahmar; their enemies, the Al Musa, Rabi'yeh wa Rufeidah, and Balasmar. Their relations with the Bahr Ibn Skeinah areneutraL :; -. ..oir dmnuunnq oik56 — (») Settled, Portion. —1,300 men.

(iii) Al Eidheilah; Sheikh, Abu Hanesh. BALASMAR. A strong tribe, situated due east of Muhail, from which they are separated by the Er-Raish. T hey are bounded on the north by the Beni Shihir, on the east by the Shahran, and on the south by the Balahmar. . Their country extends up the fertile slopes of the hills and the steep acclivity known as 'Aqabah Sajein to the summit of the Main Ridge and the plateau beyond. Jebel Hadah is the principal centre of the tribe, and the most productive. It produces coffee on the hill-terraces, and wheat and other cereals in the valleys. The Balasmar are friendly with the Balahmar and the Beni Shihir ; they are at enmity with the Er-Raish and Shahran. Their reputation for hospitality and prowess in war is good. The paramount Sheikh is 'Ali Ibn Mohammed, a firm supporter of the Idrissi. Formerly the tribe was under Turkish influence, but it threw off the yoke on the appearance of the Idrissi and has served the latter faithfully and paid him taxes ever since. The tribe is divided into :— 1. Ahl el-Jubal. 4,000 men. Entirely settled on the Main Ridge. Their chief villages, all of which are situated on the Ebhah-Taif road, are Sadwan, Hudhwah, Al Ikhrein the chief market town, El-Madfa'a the headquarters of the paramount Sheikh, and La'aban.2. Ahl et-Tihamah. 5,000 men. Settled on the hill slopes leading up to the Main Ridge.

The Bahr Ibn Skeinah live along the Muhail-Birk road, from about nine miles south-west of Muhail to within eighteen miles of Birk, a distance of approximately twenty- nine miles. They are bounded on the north by the A1 Musa, on the east by the Beni Thuwwa and Rijal el-M a, on the south by the Rijal el-M’a, and on the west by the Beni Hilal. Their countrv is thickly forested and contains many running streams; only a small portion is under cultivation. The Bahr Ibn Skeinah claim kinship with the Rijal el-M a and are usually on good terms with them. They reckon the Beni Thuwwa amongst their friends, but are always at feud with the Beni Hilal and A1 Musa, A wild and almost pagan tribe, they have never acknowledged the authority of the Turks, nor have the latter penetrated to their mountain fastnesses. Their paramount Sheikh, Sayed Mustafa, does not belong to the tribe itself but to a family of Sa'ada which has lived amongst them for many generations. He is the generalis simo of the Idrissi’s northern army and was in command of his troops during the campaign of 1910. His authority is generally recognized by all the Idrissi tribes of the mountains, with the exception of the Rijal el-M'a, whose resentment and jealousy went to such lengths that they tried to niurdei him five years ago. (a) Settled .—600 men. Chief villages Jannah. A large stone-built village, in Wadi R alah, about thirty-two miles south-west of Muhail, containing the fortress of Sayed Mustafa.— 58 Khamis el-Bahr.

The Rabi’yeh wa Rufeidah stretch from a few miles west- north-west of Ebhah to within about fifteen miles of Muhail, their country being about thirty-five miles from north to south and twenty miles from east to west on the average, though it tapers to a point in the north. The tribes which adjoin them are, on the north the Er-Raish, on the east the Balahmar and Beni Malek, on the south the Alqam el Hul, and on the west the Rijal el-M'a and the Beni Thuwwa. The tribe as a whole favours the Idrissi, chiefly because it is discontented with the Government. It is, however, notoriously fickle and unreliable and goes with the side which pays it best. It maintains a hereditary feud with the Rijal el-M'a. The chief divisions are 1. Rabi yet es-Sham, the southernmost section, entirely settled in villagesa long the Ebhah-Athalif road. 1,500 men. There is no Chief Sheikh, Aidh Ibn Hassan, the former Sheikh, having been deposed by the tribe for his desertion to the Turks. The Rabi'yet es-Sham have no connection with the Rabi'yet el-Yemen. 'The chief clan is that of the Beni Ghanmi, whose chief village is Urn Sowli. Other villages are Teihan, Um Sheraf, Bahat Rab'iveh, Um Mesjowi, and Rahban. 2. A1 Asimah. Living chiefly along the Beni Thuwwa border. Chief Sheikh, 'Ali Ibn Hamud, who fought for the Idrissi in 1910, was captured by the Turks and after a year’s imprisonment was reinstated.— 59 — (а) Settled,.—\ ,000 men.

Chief Sheikh,'Abdallah Ibn Muzerqah. All settled. Chief villages are Tabab, Sharamah, and Et-Talhah. 4. A1 Harith. Living in the Wadi Tayyah. A lawless band of highwaymen with a very bad name for treachery. They engage in the carrying trade between Muhail and the Rijal el-M'a to a certain extent, but seldom venture near Ebhah, nor can the.Turks take taxes from them as they sometimes do from the rest of the tribe. Their Chief Sheikh is Mohammed Ibn Shahir, a notorious robber. They number about 1,000 men. (а) Settled .—Chief villages are Um Jizah, Um Zahraah, Um Muqza'a, 'Afarah, and Lasafah. (б) Nomad .—Chief clans are A1 ed-Dhib, A1 Nahvat, and A1 'Aqabah. BALAHMAR. The Balahmar inhabit the main ridge to the north of Ebhah, their southern boundary approaching within ten miles of that town. They are bounded on the north by the Balasmar, on the east by the Shahran, on the south by the Beni Malek, and on the west by the Rab iyeh wa Rufeidah. Their country is amongst the most fertile in Asir and produces fruits and cereals in abundance. The tribe is lighter skinned than most, and many of them have red hair and eyebrows. They have an evil reputation for treachery and are known amongst other tribes as Kelaab el na'al, a name which implies that, as a dog in the night,60 — they will steal even the shoes of their sleeping guests. They are friendly with the Balasmar, Rabi'yeh wa Rufeidah, and Beni Malek, but inimical towards the Shahran. (a) Settled. —4.000 men. Chiei Sheikh 'Abdullah Ibn Milhem, who supports the Idrissi and collects taxes for him. The villages have a reputation for cowardice. Their head quarters are in Wadi 'Ibl, which contains several large villages. Other villages are Beihan, Sabah, Shijr, and Misfarah. (b) Nomad. —3,000 men. Chief sub-tribes are A1 Asla'a, El-Bahashah, and Beni Tha'labah. They are good fighters, but treacherous. The Chief Sheikh is c Ali Ibn 'Abshan, or Ali Ghalib Bey as he is called by the Turks. He was edu cated and trained in Turkey. With the exception of the A1 Asla'a, all his tribesmen have joined the Idrissi and he himself lives at Ebhah, not daring to go back to his country. His son, c Ali, was deputy in the Ottoman Parliament, but was captured by the Idrissi and died in captivity. RIJAL EL-M A. The Rijal el-M'a lie between Ebhah and the sea and occupy a stretch of country about fifty miles long by twenty-five miles broad. Their neighbours are the Bahr Ibn Skeinah and the Beni Thuwwa on the north, Rabi'yeh wa Rufeidah, Alqam el-Hul, Beni Mugheid, and Rabi'yet el-Yemen on the east, Beni Sh ibah on the south, and Munjahah and Beni Hilal on the west. Though not so numerous as some tribes, they are perhaps the most renowned on account of their courage and dash in war, their internal unity and their pride of independance. They support the Idrissi, but rather as equals than subjects, and have never consented to pay him taxes. The paramount Sheikh of the tribe is Ibrahim Ibn Mita'ali, now an old man of seventy, who has resigned most of the tribal administration in favour of his son Ahmed Ibn Mita'ali.— 61 — Tlio latter liasi seen service in Mikhlaf el Yemen and in the campaign against the Sherif of Meccah, and is reckoned a good leader. The Eijal el-M'a are foes with the Beni Hilal, Beni Mug- heid, Eabi'yeh wa Rufeidah, A1 Musa, and Munjahah, and friendly to the Beni Thuwwa, Alqam el-Hul, and Beni Sh'ibah. They were once good friends with the Bahr Ibn Skeinah, but relations have been strained since their refusal to accept Sayed Mustafa as their leader in the campaign of 1910. They were partly instrumental in inducing the Turks to invade Asir in 1874, being actuated by a feeling of revenge against the Beni Mugheid, who had dealt hardly with them. But they soon tired of Turkish rule, and even before the rise of the Idrissi had shown signs of rebellion. Their country is a tangled mass of mountains and exceedingly difficult for an army to invade ; at the same time it is conveniently placed for sudden dashes against unwary Turkish outposts. The tribe is subdivided as follows 1. Beni Qutabah. Living in the fertile valley of Wadi el-'Us, which rises near Sudah, and, joining the Wadi el- Ahabesh bv 'Athalif, eventually flows into the Wadi Dof'a near Muhail. The Beni Qutabah stretch from its source to beyond 'Athalif in a succession of villages. The slopes of the hills and the valleys, except where they have been cleared, are here, as elsewhere in the Rijal el-M'a country, thickly wooded. The Beni Qutabah are the chief camel car riers on all the trade routes of Asir, going to Sabiyeh, Qun- fudah, Birk, and sometimes as far as Bishah and Meccah. A small colony of 'Abadlah Ashraf lives with them. Their Chief Sheikh is Ahmed Ibn Mufraj, and they number 2,500 men. Sheikh Ibrahim el-Hufdhi of Athalif is a man of some notoriety but without much real influence. His father held an important position under the 1 urks and he has at times shown loyalty to them. He went to Constantinople in 1914 in order to press his claim for his father’s pension.The chief clans of the Beni Qutabah are, Beni 'Abdm, Beit Shaji, A1 Um Sh'abi, A1 Um Mass'am, and A1 'Amer’ Chief villages are Sheibein. A large village of about 300 stone-built houses '• situated about thirty-six miles west-north-west of Ebhah, in the Wadi el-'Us. Formerly a Turkish merkaz and now a large centre for the trade in arms and ammunition. Other villages are Ohanmah, Um Jiz'a, Um Dhah'arah and 'Athalif. 2. Beni Dhalim. Lying to the south of Wadi el-'Us. 4,000 men. Chief Sheikh, Mohammed Ibn Ahmed el- Jahwashi. They are the largest and richest section and have a great deal of the trade of Asir in their hands. They deal freely with Aden, Massowah, and the interior of Asir, and were the pioneers in the importation of firearms from Jibuti. There is an important family of Sayyids, known as the Sa'adah el-Na'amiyeh, who have lived amongst them for many generations and whose chief, Sayed Hussein el- Na'ami, is one of their best leaders. Sheikh Zein el-'Abdin, Grand Mufti of Asir, and one of the most important councillors of the Idrissi, belongs to the Beni Dhalim. He is very influential throughout the country. Their chief clans are Um Kadahah, A1 Ethman, lm Xusub, Um Baraiah, A1 el-Jae'idah, A1 Um Selami, Um Shurafah, Um Jerf, and A1 Mahub. The chief town is :— RijaL About forty-two miles from Ebhah by road, and twenty-eight miles from the coast at Wahlah. A stone-built town of some thousand houses, many of which are two or three-storied. The capital of the Rijal el-M'a, and an important centre of the export trade in semin, hides and gum, and of imported foreign goods. It is the chief arms- mart of Asir. There is good water from deep wells and the63 — town is situated in a small and well cultivated valley, surrounded by hills, which are terraced for coffee. Other villages are Manadher, 'Asalah, Ghamarah, 'Amjah, Shasa'a, and Na'ajah. 3. Beni Junah. Situated to the west of the Beni Dhalim. They engage in trade, and their chief village, Jabut, named after Jibuti, was the original centre of the arms-traffic. They are also employed in home industries and both men and women make various straw-woven articles, such as matting, baskets, and hats. Their Chief Sheikh is Ali Midkom and they are divided into two sections :— (a) Settled. —1,000 men. Chief villages are Jabut, El- Betila, Kisan, Khamis Khisan, and A1 Um Buwe’ii. (b) Nomads. —1,000 men. Chief clans are A1 Mahliah, Es-Sawajah, and En-Nuj'u. 4. Jeis Ibn Mas udi. Living near the Alqam el-Hul border. They are the most famous in war and consider it beneath their dignity to engage in trade of any sort. Ibra him Ibn Mita'ali, the paramount Sheikh, belongs to them ; but their immediate chief is his near relative, Mohammed Ibn Mita'ali. Neighbouring friendly tribes, recognizing their integrity and disinterestedness, frequently call upon their services to arbitrate in tribal disputes. They are divided as follows (а) Settled.—000 men. Chief villages are Urn Jallah, which contains the fortress of the paramount Sheikh, A1 Um Mukhili, Wadi el-Mirar, Wasanib, and Jebel Jeis. (б) Nomads .—500 men. Clans are Um Jarowiah, Um Muqlabah, A1 Hanesh, and Beni Shibli.5. Beni Zeldin. Living in the south, near the Beni Mugheid and Beni Sh'ibah boundaries. They too are noted lighters. They grow much coffee on the slopes of the hills and their nomad clans are rich in flocks. Their Chief Sheikh is Ahmed Uni Hayyani, a famous warrior and the most important man in the tribe after Ahmed Ibn Mita'ali and his father. An enemy of the Turks since childhood, he joined the Idrissi in his first rising and is now said to have almost as much influence with him as Mohammed Yehya Basahi, the Idrissi’s principal adviser. He is a great friend of Bayed Mustafa and keeps on good, though at times jealous, terms with Ahmed Ibn Mita'ali. The Beni Zeidin are divided as follows :— (a) Settled. —1,000 men. Chief villages are Hiswah, the fortress of Ahmed Urn Hayyani, Salab, A1 Zahwan, Maqtal es-Said, Wadi Hamamah, and Um Raddah. (b) Nomads—2,^00 men. Clans are A1 Dakir, A1 Wajih, A1 Um Haddi, and A1 Um Zari. 6. Shahab, living to the north, in the Wadi el-Ahabesh.

The Alqam el-Hnl occupy a narrow strip of country beginning about two miles north of Ebb ah and running out to the west for about twenty miles. The Rabi'yeh wa Rufeidah adjoin them on the north, the Beni Malek on the east, the Beni Mugheid on the south, and the Rijal el-M'a on the west. The tribe supports the Turks and pays them taxes. It is generally on bad terms with the Beni Malek and* Beni Mugheid and is friendly with the Rabi'yeh wa Rufeidah, and the Beni Qeis and Beni Zeidan sections of the Rijal el-M'a. It has a good fighting reputation. ] . Alqam es-Sahil. Living in the direction of Ebhah. 2,000 men. Chief Sheikh, Ahmed Ibn Hamid, a member of the Mejliss Baladi, or town council at Ebhah. The chief clan is that of A1 Yusef. Villages are 'Ain Ibn Musafi, Hamarah, Um Makmar, Um Shatt, A1 Um Gheidah, Qaradah, Dein Sunum and Mahsan. 2. Alqam el-Alein. Extending to the west. 2,000 men.

Villages are Jow Um Nejeim, Jebel Kotheri, Juhan, El-Gheinah, Um Mujadhah, Sudah. BENI MALEK (ASIR). The Beni Malek live to the north of Ebhah, their southern boundary approaching within two miles of that town. The adjoining tribes are: on the north the Balahmar; on the east the Shahran ; on the south the Beni Mugheid ; and on the west the Alqam el-Hul and Rabi'yeh wa Rufeidah.The tribe pays taxes to the Turks and is peaceful and unwarlike, despised by all the neighbouring tribes. The country is hilly, but fertile, and largely supplies Ebha with fruits. (a) Settled. —3,000 men. Paramount Sheikh, 'Ali Ibn Ma c addi, who is a member of the Ebhah Town Council or Me'jliss Baladi, and has a reputation for meaness. He has two sons, Ahmed Ibn 'Ali and Mansur Ibn Ma'addi. The chief divisions are :— 1. A1 el-Mujemmil. Chief Sheikh, Musa Ibn Mushafi Chief villages: A1 'Atanah, Sarur, Es-Sha'b, and A1 Urn Ru'ii. 2. Beni Rizam.

Various small clans, living in the villages of Muslit El-Meiza'a, El-Faiah, El-Melahah, and Saiad. (b) Nomads. —2,000 men. Chief Sheikh, Sa'ad Ibn Dhuh. Chief clans, Al el-Habashi, Al Rumeian, and Beni Minbeh* I'he nomads are better fighters than the settled portion. 1 hey come into the villages for the harvest and during the rest of the year wander to the east round Jinfur, an isolated village in the Shahran country which belongs to them, or go down to the Alqam el-Hul or Rabi'yeh wa Rufeidah country. They are at enmity with the Beni ThaTabah section of the Balahmar.— 67 RABI'YET EL-YEMEN. The Rabi'yet el-Yemen, who are not connected in any way with the Rabi'yet es-Sham (Rabi'yeh wa Rufeidah), are an entirely nomadic tribe, keeping chiefly to the Wadi Dhil'a and Wadi Shahlah, and sometimes going down as far as Shukeik or up to the Beni Mugheid country. They are bounded on the north and north-east by the Beni Mugheid, on the south-east by the Shahran, on the south by the Beni Shi'bah and other nomads of the Mikhlaf el-Yemen, and on the west by the Rijal el-M'a. They are rich in camels, donkeys, and flocks, and make a good living by selling semin in Ebhah. Though wild, rough, and almost pagan, they rate their honour high and have an excellent reputation for hospitality in times of peace and for straightforward fighting in war. In person they are very tall and fairer than most Arabs, with blue eyes. Milk and meat form their sole diet and all luxuries such as coffee are condemned. Their unity and cohesion is greater than is usual in Asir. Their friends are the Beni Mugheid ; their enemies, the Rijal el-M'a, Shahran, Beni Sh'ibah, and Naj 'u. The Turks have never been able to subdue them and their allegiance to the Idrissi is only nominal. ' Ali Ibn Jabbar is their Chief Sheikh. They number 5,000 men. The chief clans are A1 Bawah, Um Farahnah, A1 Fellah, A1 Shukah, A1 Museibakh, Ed-Darajin, El-Mugheidiin, Um Sherifiin, A1 Mughidhah, A1 Masud, A1 Mushni, A1 Arafin, and A1 Salim. BENI MUGHEID. The Beni Mugheid are a fine fighting tribe, dwelling in the steep hill country which leads up to Ebhah from the south, and in and round Ebhah itself. The adjoining tribes are, on the north the Alqam el-Hul and Beni Malek, on the east the Shahran, on the south the Sha'af Rash-ha and A1— 68 — Yinfa'a sections of the Shahran and the Rabi'yet el-Yemen, and on the west the Rijal el-M'a. Their southern limit is the Wadi Shahlah, which flows into the Wadi DhiTa at Heidet et-Tihamiah. The country is fertile, with running- streams, and produces coffee and fruit. The tribe numbers about 7,000 men, of whom more than 5,000 are firm adherents of the Turks, and, as their fortresses are practically impregnable in Arab warfare, they are a valuable asset on the side of the Ottoman Government. They take a considerable part in the local government and a few have been chosen to represent Asir in the Ottoman Parliament. The Rijal el-M'a are their hereditary enemies. The tribe is divided as follows 1. A1 Yazid. 300 men. (i) Awlad el-Amir Mohammed Ibn'Aidh. The former ruling family of all Asir {see Section XII). Hassan Bey Ibn ’ Ali is the head of the family and also paramount Sheikh of the Beni Mugheid and Turkish Wali, or Civil Governor, of Asir. His cousins, Nasir and Mohammed Ibn 'Abdel Rahman, support him; but his younger brother 'Ali and other members of the family are said to sympathize secretly with the Idrissi. The family lives at Reidah and Harmalah, about fifteen miles south-west of Ebhah, Hassan Ibn 'Ali himself occupying the strong fortress of Qasr Ibn Mohammed. (ii) Awlad Ibn Mufurrih. Descendents of Sheikh Mu- furrih, who was Emir of Asir in the eighteenth century and was ousted by one of the house of 'Aidh. There is a strong feeling against the ruling family both on this account and by reason of a recent blood-feud. The Awlad Ibn Mufurrih rebelled against the Turks when the Idrissi first raised his standard and, under 'Abdullah Ibn Mughethil, defeated a force sent against them. Their chief is 'Abdullah Ibn Mufurrih, for whose good behaviour the Turks have a pledge in his extensive property in Ebhah.— G9 — Ahmed Ibn Sh'ibah of this family represents Asir in the Ottoman Parliament. Their headquarters are at Sijah, a very strong fortress about three miles north of Eeidah. (hi) A1 Abu Sarah. Living at Dhohyah, just to the north of Sijah. Their Chief Sheikh is ' Ali Ibn Lahik, who is allied with the Awlad Ibn Mufurrih and said to be disloyal to the Turks. Other Sheikhs of this clan, like Mohammed Abu Dusah, openly oppose the Oovernment. 2. A1 Najih. Living just to the west of Ebhah, and said to be divided in their sympathies. 1,500 men. Their chief villages are El- 'Ithraban, El-Alayah, El-'Azizah, A1 Jerr el- Wadi, El-Joz, Imsiqah, A1 Um Hanak, A1 Um Shibah, Um Misrab, A1 Tamam, A1 Sakran, A1 el-Jabaii. 3. A1 el Wazi. Settled near the Alqam el-Hul boundary and especially noted for their bravery, which has earned them the nickname of Turk el-'Arab. They all support the Government. 1,800 men. Chief Sheikh, Mohammed Ibn Awad. (a) Settled .—Chief villages are El-Badla, Um Shahrab, Shebarjah, A1 Zeidi, and A1 Um Zenwah. (b) Nomads .—Chief clan, Um Naghalah. 4. A1 Um Sheraf. Settled along the A1 Sirhan (Shahran) border. 600 men. Chief Sheikh, Ahmed Ibn Shiblan. A notorious band of brigands who have attracted all the bad characters of the district to their country and openly wage war against society. They frequently go down to Wadi Tayyah and help the A1 Harith in their raids. Their chief clans are Beni Jurei', A1 Bel Fellah and A1 Um Nessim. Villages are Husn L'alah, Husn Lasfal, El-'Umarat, and Khadbah Beni Jur'ei,— 70 — 5. A1 Weiman. Living to the soutli near the Eabi'yet el- ^ emen. 400 men. Chief Sheikh, Mohammed Ibn Mnsa'adi who is under the influence of the Idrissi. («) Settled.. —Villages are Da'fan and Wadi Kheisha'a. (6) Nomads. —A1 Waila. 6. A1 Yezid es-Sha af. 150 men living in Shahran country. Chief Sheikh, Yehya Ibn Hadir. Chief clans, A1 M'alaf, A1 Hamam, and A1 B'awal. 7. A1 Um Jeraiat. Settled on the Main Ridge near Ebhah. 1,000 men. All pro-Turk. Chief Sheikh,'Abdullah Ibn Nimshah. Chief villages, Rudaf, El-Busrah, Musheii, Merjat, El-Heylah, El-'Arin, Ja'ad, and Jitat Ferhan. 8. A1 Um Wadi M ala. Living in Ebhah and the sur rounding villages. 1,500 men. All pro-Turk. Chief Sheikh Mohammed Ibn Musullat, who is president of the Mejliss Baladi. Other important men are 'Ali Ibn Khanfur, Deputy for Asir, and Mohammed Ibn 'Aziz, Assistant Finance Minister (Sanduk Amini). Ebhah. The capital of Asir and the residence of a Turkish Mutassarif. The main Turkish garrison is stationed here. The town is situated at a high elevation in an undulating and fertile plain surrounded on all sides by mountains. It has four important suburbs : Manadir, where is the fortress belonging to the Mohammed Ibn 'Aidb family, Maqabil, which contains the palace and garden of the Mutassarif, Qara, and El-Kushi. The name of “Ebhah” is apparently of recent origin, for Tamisier in 1835 always referred to the town as MANADIR, and it is so marked on most maps. The houses are built of stone and many of them are two or three-storied. The population is perhaps about 10,000, including the suburbs. Within a two-mile radius of the town there are four hills which are strongly fortified and— 71 — which form its defences. These are Jebel Dhira'a, which lies south-east and is said to be the key to the whole position, Qala'at en-Nusaab to the east, Jebel Dhuba'a to the north, Jebel AbuKhaial to the south, and Qala'atMiftahah to the south-south-east. SHAHRAN. The Shahran cover a greater stretch of country than any other tribe in Asir and are probably the largest unit numeri cally. They own all Wadi Bishah and follow the Wadi Shahran to its source and thence to within about twenty miles of Sabiyeh, a distance from north to south of over 20() miles. Their boundary east and west of Wadi Bishah and Wadi Shahran is undefined and constantly changing, as one or other nomad tribe gains the upper hand. Further south it is fixed, and varies from five to fifty miles in breadth. Their neighbours on the north are the wandering Shalawa and Sbe'i, on the east the 'Abidah and Rufeidet el-Yemen tribes of Qahtan, on the south the Naj'u, and on the west, starting near the sea and working north, the Beni Shi ba , Beni Mugheid (where they come to within four miles of Ebhah), Beni Malek, Balahmar, Balasmar, Beni Shihir, Bulqarn, and Shumran. The tribe has the following sub-divisions :— 1. AlMisheit. The paramount family. The present head is c Abd eWAziz Ibn Misheit, a man of about sixty, who keeps on good terms with the Turks and is a friend °f the Sheri of Meccah. He collects his own taxes. Most of the tribal administration is carried out by his son, Said Ibn Abe. The Idrissi has succeeded in detaching some of the Shahran sections ; but the influence of the ruling family is still very strong and c Abd el c Aziz Ibn Misheit and his son are probably the two most important tribal chiefs in Asir,— 72 2. A1 Risheid. Living round Khamis Misheit and in the direction of Ebhah. A prosperous and peace-loving com munity, rich in sheep and horses and owning much cultiva-. tion. They support the Turks but do not pay them taxes nor join the local gendarmerie. (а) Settled. —4,000 men. Chief Sheikh, Ali Ibn 'Iteij. Chief towns :— Khamis Misheit. About twelve miles east of Ebhah, situated in a productive and thickly populated valley. It is the most important trading centre in Asir, receiving most of the Bishah production of dates, and coffee from the Yemen, as well as hides, skins, semin, gum, and horses from the districts near by. The permanent population is small and consists of little more than a few shopkeepers, but there is of course a very large influx every Thursday, the market day. Sheikh f Abd el- r Aziz Ibn Misheit owns the only stone house in the place, the rest being made of mud. Dahban. About six miles south-east of Khamis Misbeit, large village containing the “palace” and fortress of f Abd el-'Aziz Ibn Misheit, who lives in considerable state and keeps open house to all who visit him. Other villages are El-Hirir, El-Waqabah, N'imaan, Es- Sofq, Er-Rona, A1 Jassab, Ed-Darb, Jambar, Es-Sommada, and Itwid. (б) Nomads .—500 men. Chief clans are A1 Shubeil, A1 Ghanum, and A1 Tazzah. 3. A1 Ghamar. Living along the Beni Malek boundary. Their Chief Sheikh, Mohammed Ibn 'Urur, dislikes *Abd el-'Aziz Ibn Misheit and supports the Idrissi. His followers, however, keep very much to their own country and do not meddle in politics. They are more warlike than the A1 Risheid and quarrel with them. (а) Settled .—400 men. Chief village, Taib el-Ism. (б) Nomads .—600 men. Chief clans, Awlad Muhur, A1 Shahrah, A1 et-Taiar, A1 Sa'dun, and Beni Zerabah.4. Nahas. A purely nomadic section and, of all the Shahran, the most famous in war. They live out to the east along the 'Abidah boundary and are rich in horses and sheep. All their fighting, which is principally directed against the 'Abidah, is done on horseback. The Kaud and A1 Risheid pay them tribute at the rate of twelve Turkish piastres for every well, to save themselves from being plundered. They do not cultivate but live by selling their animals and semin in Khamis Misheit. Their young men are not permitted to wear rings until they have killed a man, and, once blooded, they cut a notch on the stock of their rifles for each victim. Utterly out of hand, they never approach Ebhah and recognize neither the Turks nor the Idrissi, while the allegiance which they pay to their own paramount chief is only nominal. Their Chief Sheikh is 'Aidh Ibn Jabar, a noted warrior. They number 1,000 men. Their chief clans are A1 Khazqah, A1 Hazrah, A1 el-Heiz'aa and A1 'Aliyeh. 5. Kaud. An entirely settled community, living in Wadi Tindahah, which flows into Wadi Shahran and is the most fertile of all the Shahran country, after Bishah and Temniah. They are peaceful and unwarlike and obedient to Sheikh 'Abd el-'Aziz. Their Cheif Sheikh is Abdullah Ibn Sanah, and they number 3,000 men. Their chief villages, all situated in or near Wadi Tindahah, are A1 ed-Dhib, A1 'Ejeir, Gheithan, A1 ez-Zalal, A1 Mustanir, Es-Sadr, A1 ez-Zayan, and El-Howta. 6. Beni Bijad. Chief Sheikh, Said Ibn Hashbal, who has seceded to the Idrissi and only pays a nominal allegiance to Sheikh 'Abd el-'Aziz. He is popular with his people and takes taxes from them. (a) Settled. —3,000 men. Living chiefly along the Ebhah- Bishah road between A1 Batat and Sh afan. Their chief villages are A1 Batat, Er-Rushdaa, A1 Bithor, A1 Um Zeitil, El-Ghereirah, Es-Shajrah, El-Madhah, and Shafan.74 (b) Nomads. —7,000 men. Chief clan is Beni Munebih el-Hakam. They are warlike and fight both on horseback and on foot, the cavalry carrying lances as well as rifles. They are on bad terms with the Beni Wahab and fight the Abidah, Balahmar, and Balasmar. Like all other nomads of the vicinity, they go to Bishah for the date season. 7. Beni Wahab. The largest sub-tribe, inhabiting the country between Sha'fan and Bishah. Chief Sheikhs, Nasir I bn Heif and his son Heif Ibn Nasir. (a) Settled in Wadi Shahran. —Chief villages, El-Khadhrah and El-Museiriq. (b) Settled in Bishah. —Chief Sheikhs, Yehya Ibn Faiz (agent for the Sherif), and Nasir Ibn Kurkman (agent for the Idrissi). There are more than fifty villages in Bishah, of which the most important are Bowshin, Nimran, A1 Bashuk, Ez-Zeraib, Al Khalit, Wadi el-Leimun, and A1 Shukban. Sheikh 'Abd el-Aziz Ibn Misheit owns extensive date groves in the valley. The settled population numbers 2,000 men. (c) Nomads of Wadi Shahran. —Chief clans are Al Buljarib Al Mustur, El Sfalah. (d) Nomads of Bishah. —Chief clans are Ma'awiah, Er- Rimathein, 'Uqlub, Beni Salul, El-Jeradin, and Mahlaf. The nomads altogether number 13,000 men. The vil lagers and nomads of Bishah are moderately civilized ; but the Beni Wahab, as a whole, have a most evil reputation. They are treacherous even to their guests, have little religion, and no marriage laws, and spare neither women nor children in their raids. The man with the strongest hand rules them and the present Sheikhs won their position by forcibly ejecting the former Sheikh, Ibn Hashal, who has now degen erated into a petty and uninfluential highwayman. They are against every tribe and every government and are paid by other weaker tribes to refrain from raiding. At certain seasons of the year they go out to Tathlith, where there is excellent grazing for their many flocks and herds.8. Sha'af Rash-hah. Living chiefly along the Dahran road to the south of Ebhah, from which they are separated by the Beni Mugheid. 4,000 men.

The Sha'af Rash-hah and A1 Yinfa'a are allied and have a good reputation for hospitality and courage. 'Abdullah I bn Hamudh is their common Sheikh. He formerly sided with the Turks, but broke with them and Sheikh 'Abd el-'Aziz, about eight years ago, when his son was murdered by the Beni Wahab while a guest at Dahban. Since then he has joined the Idrissi, who now has a police post in Temniah and levies taxes on the people. The enemies of these two sub tribes are the Rufeidet el-Yemen and Rabi'yet el-Yemen ; their friends the Arabs of Mikhlaf el-Yemen. The nomads of A1 Yinfa'a are owners of horses and sell them in the Sabiyeh market. QAHTAN. The Qahtan tribes of Asir are the Rufeidet el-Yemen, Beni Bisher, Senhan el-Hibab, Abidah, Wada’a, and Shereif. They are known generically as the Qahtan and pay allegiance to a common paramount chief ; but they are in fact a loose confederation of autonomous tribes, each possessing its own specified territory, and having its separate ambitions, its special friends and enemies, and its peculiar customs.— 76 Part of the Rufeidet el-Yemen is under Turkish influence, but the majority of the tribes acknowledge the Idrissi. It is only in times of great crisis that they answer to the call of their common blood, as in the great war with the Shahran about a hundred years ago, or nowadays when the Idrissi calls on them to rally to his standard under their common leader. In normal times each tribe pursues its own way, and although Sheikh Mohammed Dhuleim, the paramount chief, may be called in to settle tribal disputes and is responsible to the Idrissi for good order, he has little to do with the tribal administration. Sheikh Dhuleim Ibn Sh'ar, the father of the present chief, who died about sixteen years ago, was a famous man in Asir and for many years was Mudir of the Qahtan tribes. He was of the Shereif and lived at Harajah, where there was also a Turkish garrison and Mudiria. Sheikh Mohammed Ibn Dhuleim succeeded him, but seceded to the Idrissi when the latter revolted. The Turks thereupon sent an expedition against him and burnt his fortress at Harajah, but were ultimately forced to retire and have not penetrated to his country since. The Idrissi made him a Maqdami or general and he was in command of the Qahtan tribes against the Turks andSherif of Meccah in 1910. About three years ago he and Sayed Arar Ibn Nasir led the Idrissi’s army against the Imam’s forces under Mohammed Abu Nuweiba in the Sahar country. He is still a young man of about thirty-five years of age, rich according to the standards of the country, and with an excellent reputation both as a leader in war and a tribal administrator. The tribes are too far removed from the northern Qahtan, who range from west of the Wadi Dawasir almost up to Hautah, to keep in touch with them. Sometimes in periods of drought, a few of their northern relations bring their herds down south ; they are always well received, but the connection ends at that. The Qahtan tribes of Asir, with the exception of certain nomad sub-tribes, are well conducted, prosperous, and interested in trade or agriculture. The different sections vary considerably in military skill, but few of them appear to have inherited the supposed characteristics which have earned for their northern relations such an unsavoury reputation. I.—Rufeidet el-Yemen. The Kufeidet el-Yemen is the westernmost tribe of Qahtan. Itliess outh-eastof Ebhah and extends up the 'Aqabah and over the Main Ridge to beyond the source of Wadi Shahran. The adjoining tribes are: on the north and west the Shahran, on the north-east and east the ' Abidah, on the south-east the Beni Bisher, and on the south the Naj 'u and other Mikhlaf el-Yemen nomads. The paramount Sheikh is Hussein Ibn Heif of Mudhiq, who supports the Idrissi. His sister is married to Sheikh Mohammed Ibn Dhuleim, and the two chiefs are close friends. The settled portions are peaceful and engaged in farming or trade. The nomads are good fighters. The tribe is divided as follows :— 1. A1 el-Jihal. 4,000 men. Chief Sheikh, Mohammed Ibn Shuweil. All settled. The chief clan is that of the Beni Jabrah. The chief villages are Dhibet A1 el-Jihal, El-Mahjar, El- Qelt, El-Jirr, Um Rahwa, El-Jara, Mahshush, and A1 Ramadan. The Al el-J dial have for generations been separated from the rest of the tribe and live a few miles to the west amongst the Sha'af Rash-hah and Al Sirhan sections of the Shahran. They have not, however, intermarried with the latter and are obedient to Hussein Ibn Heif, although they hold aloof from the quarrels which are constantly arising between their own tribe and their hereditary enemies. They are strongly is favour of the Idrissi and have fought for him on several occasions.— 78 — 2. Bishet Ibn Salim. Living chiefly along the Ebhah— Dahran road in the direction of the Shahran. An entirely settled section, whose chief clans are the Beni Wahab and Beni Thabit. They number 5,000 men. Their chief Sheikh is Mohammed Ibn 'Ali Walad f Ali Ibn Mur'ah, a shifty and cowardly man, who supports the Turks and receives a stipend from them. They pay taxes to the Government. Their chief villages are Dha'i, El-Bothah, A1 Hideilah, A1 Um Hayyah, A1 Hetrush, Waqashah, A1 Mushabab, and Es- Sh'ib. Their chief market town is Ahad Rufeidah, which ranks second to Khamis 'Abidah among the Qahtan trading centres. 3. Beni Qeis. Lying to the east of the Bishet Ibn Salim and also paying taxes to the Turks. Their chief Sheikh is Abu Salaam, an old man of over seventy-five, who has the reputation of always siding with the strongest party. (а) Settled. —2,400 men. The chief clan is that of the Beni Temim. Their chief villages are A1 el-Mudhiq, A1 Abu Midrib, A1 el-Mudir, El-Fara'ein, A1 Jafei, A1 Farawau, El- Jaraha, A1 Lot, and A1 Meisara. (б) Nomads .—600 men. Chief clan, A1 es-Shuwat. Chief Sheikh, Mohammed Ibn Hashash, who sides with the Idrissi. 4. Sha'af Y arimah wa Khutab. Occupying the sou thern portion of the territory. They are a wild and unci vilized people, who regard with suspicion any who enter their country. Their Sheikh is named Jeleid. (a) Settled. —1,000 men. Chief clan, Beni Burrah. (b) Nomads. —1,000 men. The chief division is that of the A1 Jelihah, subdivided into the clans of Beni Meleik and A1 Hilami.— 79 — II.— Abidah. The 'Abidah appear to be the bravest as well as the most prosperous and enterprising tribe of the Qahtan. Their boundary in the south, where they have their villages, is well marked, but in the north their nomads wander over a vast stretch of country, their undefined western boundary adjoining that of the Shahran for almost 150 miles. To the east lies Tathlith and the Yam tribes, to the south the Beni Bisher, and to the south-west, the Rufeidet el-Yemen. The 'Abidah follow sheikh Mohammed Ibn Dhuleim in battle, but they are normally on bad terms with the Shereif and look to their own Sheikh, Sa'ad Ibn Suleim, in tribal matters. The latter seceded to the Idrissi on his first revolt *knd is one of his most faithful followers. The Idrissi collects taxes from all the tribe. There is a hereditary enmity between the Shahran and Qahtan, which was accentuated in the case of the 'Abidah by the death of one of Sheikh 'Abd el-'Aziz Ibn Misheit’s sons in a petty tribal dispute about fifteen years ago. So deep is the enmity between them that the payment of blood-money is never entertained and many blood-feuds have arisen in conse quence. Towards other tribes the Abidah are kindly and hospitable, and the nomads, though rough, are said not to be treacherous. The tribe is divided as follows :— (a) Settled. —i),000 men. The chief clan is that of the Beni Talaq. The chief town is Khamis-'Abidah, the largest market of southern Asir, situated about seventy miles east-south-east of Ebha. Skins, hides, semin, gum, animals, and coffee from Yemen are collected here. The town consists of over 200 houses built of stone and dried mud-bricks and contains the fortress of Sa'ad Ibn Suleim. Villages are As-Ejreish, A1 Bassam, A1 es-Sadr, A1 Urn Ammir, A1 ez-Ziheir, El-Wahaba, A1 Ferdan, A1 A'abis Turib, and El-'Arin.— so The settled 'Abidah are largely engaged in trade. Some of them live permanently in Rijal, Ebhah, and Namas, as merchants, and others have business with Jiddah. They are a very industrious race, with an ambition to become rich, and their villages are numerous and well built. They also specialize as masons and ply their trade throughout Asir. They are friendly with the Rufeidet el-Yemen and Senhan el-Hibab. but do not agree with the Beni Bisher or Shereif. (b) Nomads.—7,000 men. Chief divisions are A1 Hamdan, (3,000 men), A1 Hurjan (2,000 men), El-Fahar, A1 Kera'an, El-Jerabih, El-Jahalein, and Es-Sfala. The nomads are more united than is the case in most tribes and model their tribal policy on that of the villagers. They are rich in a dark breed of camels and sheep and take great pride in their pedigree horses, which they only part with on exceptional occasions. Their poorer animals are sold in Khamis 'Abidah. During the harvest, they draw in to the southern villages and afterwards go up to Bishah for the date season. They also wander out to Tathlith, where they meet other Qahtan Arabs and those of the Yam tribes, and find succulent grasses on which to fatten their herds. Their country produces gum in large quantities, which they collect and sell in Khamis ’ Abidah. In war they fight on camels or horseback and carry rifles, lances, and long curved jenabih. They are always at odds with the northern nomads of the Shahran and sometimes cut across and raid the Ebhah-Bishah road round Bir Abu Sarar. III.—Beni Bisher. The Beni Bisher stretch from the steppe country in the east, over the Main Ridge and down the mountainous slopes leading to the district of Mikhlaf el-Yemen, their nearest point to Sabiyeh being about thirty miles distant. Their country is barren in the east, but productive and well6 — 81 — forested as it approaches the sea. The adjoining tribes are the 'Abidah on the north, Yam, Shereif, and Senhan ebHibab on the east, Beni Juma'a on the south, and the Naj ti and Rufeidet el-Yemen on the west. c Abd el-Uadi is the Chief Sheikh, who possesses only a nominal influence over the nomad sections. He deserted the Turks some years ago, and all the tribe pays taxes to the Idrissi at the present time. The settled portion is prosperous and hospitable, but the nomads are wild, intractable, almost pagans and with no marriage laws. They roam chiefly about the Tihamah and are rich in a breed of large black sheep. The tribe is friendly with the 'Abidah and Rufeidet el-Yemen and generally at odds with the Naj’u, Senhan el-Hibab, and Yam. (а) Settled. —1,000 men. Their chief villages on the Ebhah-Dahran road are El-Usran, where a small market is held, Shaqb, El-'Abidiyeh, A1 Um 'Aidh, El-Mufurrij, and A1 Ferhat. (б) Nomads. —3,000 men. The chief division is that of the A1 'Urfan, whose clans are A1 Haial, Et-Tihman, A1 Um Mohammed, A1 Ferhan, and A1 'Araab. IV.—Shereif. The 8hereif live to the east of the Beni Bisher and are bounded on the north by the Beni Bisher and Yam tribes, on the east by the Yam, arid on the south by the Senhan el-Hibab. Their country consists of undulating and dusty steppes. It is almost treeless and most of their cultivation is from well water. They are traders rather than agriculturists and are well conducted and unwarlike. They pay taxes regularly to the Idrissi. In Sheikh Mohammed I bn Dhuleim of whom mention has been already made, lies their chief claim to fame.82 — The tribe is divided as follows :— (а) Settled .—600 men. The chief village is Harajah, which is on the main Yemen road, about 100 miles south east of Ebhah. It contains about 200 houses, built with stone and sun-dried bricks, and the newly built fortress of the paramount Sheikh. Other villages are A1 ed-Dhuleim, A1 'Ajla, El-Hamrah, and El-Beidah. (б) Nomads .—200 men. Chief clan, A1 es-Seri, whose Sheikh is Dhuleim Ibn Sha'ii. V.—Senhan el-Hibab. The Senhan el-Hibab are bounded on the north by the Shereif and Yam tribes, on the east by the Wada'a, and west by the Beni Bisher. Their southern boundary im pinges on the Yemen. The tribe numbers about 4,000 men, of whom three- quarters are nomads. The villagers are hospitable, but the nomads are wild and savage, frequently cutting the roads and not sparing men, women, or child in their raids. The nomads do not cultivate, but are rich in a dark breed of camels and collect gum, which they sell chiefly in Khamis 'Abidah. The tribe is warlike and well led by Sheikh Ferdan Ibn Dhuleim, who lives in Rabat Senhan. The villagers pay taxes to the Idrissi; but the nomads will not do more than help in war. Their friends are the 'Abidah and Beni Bisher; their foes the Shereif, Wada'a, and Yam. They unite under Sheikh Mohammed Ibn Dhuleim at the summons of the Idrissi, but normally pay him only a nominal allegiance. (а) Settled. —1,000 men. Chief villages are Rabat Senhan, El-Hodlib, El-Khadd, A1 Ferwan, and El-Irq. (б) Nomads. 3,000 men. Chief Sheikh, Julid. Chief divisions are A1 Zerbah, A1 Ghazi, A1 es-Sherif, A1 Salman, and A1 Shokan.— 83 — VI.—Wada'a. The Wada'a are a small mercantile tribe, living in the district of the same name near Nejran. They are bounded on the north and east by the Yam tribes, and on the west by the Senhan el-Hibab. They are the last inland Sunni tribe, and from their southern boundary begin the Zeidi tribes of Yemen. Their country is not naturally productive, but they own a large number of wells and grow grapes, which are converted into raisins and sold as far away as Ebhah and Rijal. They also import coffee from Jebel Razih and Khaulan es- Sham in Yemen. They are generally on bad terms with the Yam tribes, but are not naturally quarrelsome or pugnacious and pay their taxes regularly to the Idrissi. 'Ali Rukwan, their Chief Sheikh, makes an annual pilgri mage to Meccah and acts as Emir el Haj to all the Qahtan tribes of Asir. They number 600 men. Their chief village is Dahran, the capital of Wada'a, situated on the Ebhah-Dahran road, about 107 miles from the former town. The chief market of the tribe is held here. Other villages are Safwan, El-Beida, and El-Irq Wada'a.Inland Tribes of Asir (continued). 88 iiufeitlet el-Yemen (half).— 90 — XV.—PERSONALITIES. 'Abbas (Ibn).

There are no made roads in Asir, and such routes as there are invariably follow the line of least resistance, taking the easiest way through mountainous country and in more . barren parts leading to where water may be found. With the exception of the Ebhah-Bisha road, which Tamisier passed over in 1834, the country has never been described by a European and due account must be taken of this fact in estimating the value of the routes set out in detail in this Handbook. They have been compiled entirely from native information and therefore can only be expected to locate approximately the places referred to. Travelling in Asir is apt to be a dangerous matter, not through any natural causes, but on account of the uncontrolled and predatory character of the tribes. Natives, therefore, generally attach themselves to some armed caravan before venturing outside their own boundaries. The main maritime route from Lith to Wadi 'Ain (Route No. 14) passes in its first stages, through the dangerous zone of the Dhuwwi Hassan and Dhuwwi Barakat tribes, and although both water and supplies are to be found in their villages, caravans have perforce to be self-sufficing. Further on the inhabitants are more hospitable and the country is richer, and when the district of Mikhlaf el-Yemen, which is directly administered by the Idrissi, is entered, travelling becomes an easy matter. The road keeps close to the coast from Lith to Um el-Khishib and then turns inland. It lies over sand and is suitable for camels only ; the going is very heavy in places, but there are no other physical difficulties. The heat, however, is intense. The Turks in Asir have, for some time past, been restricted to the use of the road down Wadi Tayya from Ebhah to Muhail (Route No. 6), and to the Sikket Barak from Muhail on to Qunfudah (Route No. 10). 8114 — The former is avoided by travellers and merchants because neither water nor supplies can be procured for more than half the distance and because the Wadi Tayya is infested with robbers. The route coincides with the main pilgrim route to Mecca as far as Jebel Sha'r and then plunges abruptly down the pass of ' Aqabah Sha'r till the Wadi Tayya is reached. The Turks have improved the old road down the pass and rendered it practicable for heavy loads. The main inland road from the Yemen to the Hejaz is described in Routes Nos. 3 and 5. It lies for the most part through elevated hilly country and is practicable both for donkeys and camels. Villages are encountered at frequent intervals and there is no difficulty about supplies or water at any point in Asir. The villagers are, for the most part, friendly to strangers passing through on pilgrimage. The most important trade route from the coast to southern inland Asir is up the Wadi Rim, which lies about half-way between Wasm and Shukeik (Route No. 8). It taps the fertile Rijal el-M'a country and links up with all the main roads of the interior. Supplies and water are plentiful. The Ebhah to Bishah road (Route No. 4) sees considerable traffic during the date season. It is traversed only by large and well armed caravans on account of the robber bands of nomads en route. The caravans, as a rule, are formed at Khamis Mishait and travel under the escort of the Shahran tribe. The road is fairly level and passes over a sterile and undulating country intersected by several fertile valleys.Route No. 1. — EBHAH to DARB (Darb Beni Shi'bah). Bu'sah, a clearing in the woods and a resort of nomad Arabs. Wadi Hilali, the boundary between the Beni Mugheid and Rabi'yet el-Yemen, is crossed.
