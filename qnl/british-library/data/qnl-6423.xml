CONFIDENTIAL. tfemorandum relative to the Appointment of British Officers to organise the Persian Army, THE question of the appointment of British •officers to assist in the organization of the Persian army is one that has led to a considerable corre spondence between the Foreign and India Offices. In 1807, after the peace of Tilsit and the compact entered into between France and Russia for an attack on the British possessions in India, the British Government were moved to take measures to secure the alliance of the Powers occupying the countries between Europe and India, such as Persia, Afghanistan, Sindh, and the Punjab. For the purpose of carrying out this policy, Missions were sent to Persia under Sir H. Jones and Sir John Malcolm. The latter took with him a staff of British officers; and it was considered, when the objects of the Mission had been attained, that it would be a good stroke of policy to leave them in Persia to discipline and command the regiments of the Shah, and thus supplant the French officers who had up to that time been supreme. The French officers under General Goudaune having been withdrawn from the Shah's service, several British officers remained in Persia and took part in the war between Persia and Russia. On the conclusion of peace between England and Russia in 1812, the greater part of these officers were with drawn. Up to 1833, however, some of these officers still continued with the Persian army, and in that year they were further augmented ; but, in 1838, in consequence of the operations of Persia against Herat, [530] Bwhich caused a rupture between Great Britain and Persia, the British officers were withdrawn. It was during these latter years, that a discussion occurred between the Foreign Office and the East India Company on the subject of the payment of the expenses of the officers attached to the Mission in Persia. The East India Company maintained that the expenses of their maintenance should be paid out of the 12,000/. a year, which they had consented to pay towards the expenses of the British Mission in Persia on its transfer to the Imperial Government ; whereas it was maintained by Her Majesty's Govern ment that the charge for officers employed to discipline the Persian troops, formed no part of the estimate of the charges to be defrayed out of the above sum, and that it was never contemplated that the cost should be thrown upon the King. This charge, it was further observed, required as it was by the clearest views of policy, was altogether unconnected with the Mission, to which was confided only the maintenance of diplomatic relations with the Shah of Persia. The result of this correspondence was an arrangement, with the East India Company, for the temporary payment of the expenses, pending negotiations with the Shah, for his taking upon himself a part or the whole of the expenses connected with the question. In consequence of the withdrawal of the British officers in 1838, the proposed arrangement did not take place, and the question of the employment of British officers in a similar capacity does not appear to have been renewed until 18o9. In that year Sir H. Rawlinson was appointed by the India Office, to whom the Persian Mission in Persia had then been transferred by the Imperial Government, British Minister at Tehran. In his instructions the attention of Sir H. Rawlin- To Sir H. Rawlirson; son was particularly called to the influence which the French Government were endeavouring* to establish in Persia by means of a considerable-staff of military officers then employed with the Persian troops. Sir Henry was desired to send the fullest possible information of the manner in which these officers were severally employed, and of the extent of the influence which they had established; and he was August 24, 1859.U5 0 urged to take the first favourable opportunity to y. lT ^ ' ave them replaced by British officers II : Rawhnson, No. 72, Confi- T n a -i t o Rn c ' tt r» dential ; April 27, 1860. A P ri1 1860 Sir H. Rawlmson, in a long despatch, gave the substance of conversations which he had had with the Shah and also with his Prime Minister, Ferukh Khan, on the subject of the organization of the Persian army by British officers. In this conversation, both the Shah and his Minister ^ - urged the importance of such organization with a view to meet the advance of Russia in Central Asia. The plan proposed by the Persian Sovereign was that a contingent of 10,000 men should be made ovei to forty British officers, to be under their entire control, the Shah sanctioning only the appointment of the Persian officers. For the 4 purposes of clothing, arming, &amp;c., this contingent, the Persian Minister urged the grant of a subsidy by Great Britain of 100,000Z. per annum. With regard to the effect upon Russia of such an arrangement, both the Shah and his Minister stated that they must expect the displeasure of that Power; but as no infraction of Treaty stipulations would be ' incurred, her ill-humour could only be expended in hard words and sullen looks. Sir H. Rawlinson expressed himself as favourably disposed to entertain the proposal of the Persian Government, particularly as the bargain would be made terminable either in three or five years. At the same time he pointed out certain objections to the carrying out of the plan, particularly the diffi culty of dealing with the corrupt and greedy officials of the Persian Government, who would desire to inter fere with the promotion and pay of the contingent. He, however, considered that the money would be well laid out if it even led to no further result than com mitting Persia thoroughly to the English alliance and if the formation of the contingent really confirmed the independence of Persia and constituted an effec tive harrier against the further extension of Russian power towards India, he thought that it would be the greatest political object that was ever achieved at so little expense. As a mere abstract question of expediency he considered that it would be to the advantage of Great Britain to see such a contingent established in Persia. To Mr. Alison, No. 46; In these views, however, Her Majesty's Govern- . July 3,1860. ment not concurj and some of the reasons statedby Sir H. Rawlinson against the proposed con tingent and subsidy were considered as decisive. In the event of any aggression by Russia, Mr. Alison, who had succeeded Sir H. Rawlinson at Tehran, the Persian Mission having been retransferred to the Imperial Government, was informed that Her Majesty's Government would greatly prefer sending a subsidiary force from India to support Persia, to paying a subsidy in time of peace. Such a force, it was observed, would be, in regard to pay, discipline, and promotion, under the control of Her Majesty's Government, and would only be employed when wanted. T he Shah, Mr. Alison was informed, might always rely on the friendly disposition of the British Govern ment, but the proposed grant of a subsidy could not be entertained. The question of the employment of British Mr - officers in Persia was again mooted in 1863, when Mr. Eastwick, who was then acting as Olrarge d'Affaires, stated that the Persian Government was most desirous to return to the old system, when the Indian Government lent a certain number of mili tary officers to that of Persia. Mr. Eastwick con sidered that the arrival of English officers in Persia would have a very tranquillizing effect, as the fall of Herat might possibly very much increase the alarm which the siege of that city by the Afghans had already occasioned. The Persian Government, he stated, would be satisfied with four officers at first, and, supposing them to be paid their regular pay by the Indian Government, those of them below the rank of Major would receive, in addition, about 180/. a year as field allowance, and Majors double that amount. Both the India and War Offices concurred with the Foreign Office in the expediency of complying with the Shah's wishes; but, in conse- ^ , quence of the small remuneration offered by the Persian Government, the Governor-General of India reported that officers of the experience and rank required could not be induced to accept such service. In the meantime Mr. Thomson had been informed To that the India Office had no objection to accede to the wishes of the Persian Government, and that the Secretary of State for India was willing that ordinary pay and allowances of the officers to be employedTo Mr. Alison, No. 13; September 24, 1863.

He was directed, also, clearly to explain to the Shah's Govern- ment, that any British officers placed at their disposal must on no account be employed against the allies ot the British Government, and that Her Majesty's Government would also reserve to them selves the right of recalling their officers whenever ciicumstances might necessitate such a course. in consequence, however, of the opinion expressed by the Government of India that officers could not be induced to serve in Persia on the terms offered, the question again dropped, and was not renewed until 1868, when it would appear that the Persian Charge d Affaires, by direction of his Government, again requested that British officers should be appointed to organize the Persian army. This request was referred to the India Office, who', in reply, expressed their concurrence, considering that it was highly important to comply with the Shah's wishes; but at the same time they pointed out the difficulties of obtaining efficient officers for, the service, unless they received high pay and remuneration. Mr. Alison was, in consequence, directed to ascertain the views and wishes of the Persian Government as to allowances. Mr. Alison, in reply to his instructions, urged that, if it was considered really of importance, in the then conjunction of affairs, to send military officers to Persia for the organization of the Shah's troops, it would greatly enhance their position and influence were they paid entirely by the British Government. The number of officers required by the Persian Government Mr. Alison stated, was one Colonel and about fifteen commissioned and non-commissioned officers. He at the same time requested to be informed what was the amount of allowances which would be deemed sufficient. The despatches from Mr. Alison having been referred to the India Office, that Department again concurred in the expediency of granting the request of the Shah, Sir S. Northcote expressing his opinion that it would be advisable, in the then existing state of our relations with Persia, to revert [530] ■ Cto a system which, from the commencement of the century up to the year 1839, was observed with good results. Sir S. Northcote observed, however, that it was necessary that the officers selected for this service should be in every respect qualified for the peculiar duties which they would be called upon to perform; and it could not be expected that officers who had good professional prospects in India would abandon them for an employment which, however inviting in some respects, must be more or less precarious, without sufficient inducement being held out to them in the shape of superior emoluments. With regard to the allowances. Sir S. Northcote observed that the question arose as to whether they should be paid out of the Treasury of the Indian Government or disbursed by the Shah of Persia. With regard to Mr. Alison's suggestion that the entire expense should be paid by the British Government, it was observed by Sir S. Northcote that some difficulties might arise with reference to the position of other European Courts represented by their Ministers at Tehran, from such a decided action on our part. The India Office further expressed their willing ness to sanction the employment of a certain number of Indian officers in the manner suggested, and to pay them from the Indian Treasury a consoli dated allowance on the scale of the arrangement sanctioned with reference to the establishment under Colonel Passmore; but, in the opinion of Sir S. Northcote, it was desirable that some additional allowance should be granted by the Shah, of such a kind as could not inconvenience His Majesty's Government by the magnitude of the demand. Whether these additional allowances should be paid, in the first instance, from the British or Persian Treasury, it was suggested, was a subject for future consideration. Lord Stanley concurred in the views expressed t t ^ , ,, , r i o India Umce; m the above letter from the India Office, and November 21, 1868. suggested that the latter Department should fix the scale of »al lowances which should be assigned to the various officers by the Persian Government. On the 5th March, 1869,the India Office replied India Office- to this last communication by sending a scale of March 5, 1 869.'1 R To Mr. Alison, No. 13; March 9, 1869. Mr. Alison, No. 50; May 6, 1869. To Mr. Alison; August 4, 1869. Mr. Alison; August 5, 1869. allowances, which they considered would be sufficient to induce officers with the necessary qualifications to accept the service. A copy of the above letter was sent to Mr. Alison, and he was instructed that, should the Persian Government accept the proposed arrangement, he should take precautions for securing the due performance of any engagement entered into by them. Mr. Alison, in accordance with his instructions, communicated to the Shah's Government the scale of allowances proposed by Her Majesty's Govern ment. In reply to this communication, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that the Shah was desirous that Mr. Alison should explain verbally, on his return to England, his views and wishes on the subject, which were as follows:— His Majesty was most anxious that the relations between the two countries should be placed in the same cordial footing as they were in the time of Feth AH Shah, when a detachment of English officers were employed in Persia by the English Govern ment in organizing the Shah's army. His Majesty hoped that the British Government would now follow a similar course, and send the officers required without stipulating that they should be paid by the Shah, who would, on his part, not fail to make such a return for this friendly act as would be most gratifying to them. On the arrival of Mr. Alison in England in 1869 he was requested by the Foreign Office to state his opinion on the proposed employment of officers in Persia. Mr. Alison, in reply, stated that there could be no doubt, in his opinion, that the officers required by the Shah could really improve the organization of the Persian army; and that, if those officers were to be made totally independent of the Persian Government, it would materially improve their position, entitle them to greater consideration, and would enable them to exercise a degree of authority which would be attended with beneficial results. The Persian army, Mr. Alison observed, was in a pitiable condition, its only instructois being a few Italian refugees who enjoyed no consideration, and who passed half their time in running after their pay and allowances.s The failure of the late French military mission Mr. Alison ascribed to the unpunctuality of the Persian Government in money matters, and the French Minister had informed him that his position had been materially impaired by his having to appeal to the Persian authorities for the payment of moneys due to the French officers. If Her Majesty's Government should consider it advisable to incur the expense which the Shah wished them to undertake with reference to these officers, Mr. Alison was of opinion that it would not be desirable that it should be so openly stipu lated with the Persian Government, as such a fact would not improve the relations existing between Persia and Russia, particularly as the latter Power could at any time find a plausible pretext for making the Shah feel its displeasure. Mr. Alison suggested that the Persian Government might allot suitable pay and allowances to the officers required, but it might be arranged that Her Majesty's Government would not press the subject. Mr. Alison further observed, that, the Shah's anxiety regarding the progress of Russia in Asia Minor, rendered him most desirous of the scheme being carried out; as it would not only improve his army, but it would raise him also in the consideration of his own subjects, a matter to which he attached a good deal of importance. Mr. Alison stated that the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs had explained to him that the pay ment by the British Government of the officers required, was one of the terms contemplated by the Shah. With regard to any engagement entered into by the Shah regarding the pay and allowances, Mr. Alison observed, that he had no doubt but that they would be ultimately fulfilled, but then it would be attended with the inconveniences pointed out with regard to the French Military Commission. A copy of Mr. Alison's letter was sent to the To India Office; India Office, and, in February 1870, a letter was August 9, 1 869. , ~ „ , India Office; received from that Department requesting further February 21,1870. reference to Tehran, with regard to the desire of the Shah for the appointment of these officers, even should it be decided that their allowances would have to be paid by his Government. In answer to this letter, the Foreign Office urged To India Office; whether, considering the statement of Mr. Alison F ebruary 28, 1870.9 Of the desire of the Shah that the officers should e paic y Her Majesty's Government, it would 'Ot be expedient, without the delay which would he caused by further reference to Tehran, of corning India Office; t0 801110 ^ eterm i n ation on the subject. March ' 7 ' 1870 - . The India 0ffic ^ ^ reply to this last communica tion, observed that the payment in full by the British Government of the officers so em P lo y ed,~that is, of their special local allowances as well as of their ordinary Indian pay, might appear to indicate a forwardness upon our part to promote an arrange ment, which had been acceded to only in accordance with the strongly expressed desire of His Majesty the Shah. Such a proceeding might be represented as pro tanto a subsidizing of the Persian Govern ment for purposes of our own, which the India Office observed might give umbrage to foreign Powers. Should Lord Clarendon, however, be of opinion that there was no objection on this score, to the entire remuneration of these officers from British sources, then the India Office stated that they would be prepared to furnish the required number ot officers of the Indian army, who would receive from the Indian Treasury their ordinary staff corps pay and allowances, leaving it to Lord Clarendon to decide with respect to their local allowances (on the scale indicated in the India Office letter of the 5th March, 1869), whether these additional payments should be paid by [the Shah or by Her Majesty's Government, either from the money disbursed by the India Government for the general purposes of the Mission, or from any Imperial funds to which it might be considered advisable to charge the amount. Foreign Office ; In reply to the above letter the India Office was March 26, 1870. informed that the Earl of Clarendon did not antici pate, under the circumstances of the case, that the payment in full by the British Government of the proposed allowances would be likely to give umbrage to other Powers, as it would, in regard to so much of the pay as was derived from British sources, irrespective of the additional pay which the Persian Government agreed to make good, though it was for a long time in arrear, only be reverting to the course pursued in 1835. The India Office was however informed, that the Earl of Clarendon could not recommend that the [530] , D10 expense should be paid by the Imperial Govern ment, and it would therefore be for the India Office to decide, whether they were prepared to undertake the entire payment of the officers in question, or whether Mr. Thomson should be instructed to inform the Persian Government that Her Majesty's Government were willing to furnish the required number of officers of the Indian army, who would receive from the Indian Treasury their ordinary staff corps pay and allowances, on the understanding that satisfactory arrangements were made for the payment by the Persian Government of their local allowances on the scale indicated in the letter from the India Office of the 5th March, 1869.* Since 1870 no further correspondence has passed on the subject, no reply having been received from the India Office to the above letter. I From the foregoing Memorandum it will be observed— 1st. That Her Majesty's Government have recog nized the expediency of granting the request of the Shah; 2ndly.
