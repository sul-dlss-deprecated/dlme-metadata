A camp of white tents of varying sizes takes up the foreground at left; behind them a plantation of palms extend beyond the scene at far left. As the sun is setting at right, it seems likely that the view is roughly southwards.Temporal Context:Although the image dates from the Ouseley embassy 1810–12, the adjacent caption/description likely dates from c. 1880 and was written by later owner of the album, F. G. McCutcheon.Inscriptions:Recto:Lower right corner, in pencil: ‘27’Verso:Upper left, in pencil: ‘The Camp at Dalkie [Daliki] on the Road from Bushire to Shiraz’Adjacent inscription: ’27. Dalkee (one stage from Burazjoon) – The camp at Dalkee, a station near Bushire on the route from Bushire to Shiraz. There are sulphur springs in the neighbourhood.’ ‘Murray’s Guide p. 463.’</abstract><typeOfResource>still image</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Drawing</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Joseph D'Arcy</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">artist</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100027191683.0x000003#share">Public Domain</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
