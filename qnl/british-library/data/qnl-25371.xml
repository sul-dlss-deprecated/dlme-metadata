Foreign Office, Sir, ^ 12 th October 1914. I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you here with, to he laid before the Marquess of Crewe, a copy of a letter from the Imperial Bank of Persia, calling attention to the serious consequences that may arise if the coupon of 15th November of the Imperial Persian Loan of 1911 is passed through lack of funds. Sir Edward Grey would be glad to receive any observations His Lordship may wish to offer on the subject. I am, tkc., The Under Secretary of State Eyre A. Crowe. for India. Annex 1 :—Imperial Bank of Persia to Foreign Office. 25, Abchurch Lane, London, E.C., Sir, 8 th October 1914. I have the honour to refer to a communication addressed to you by the Bank on 24th September, with reference to the possibility of there being a deficiency in the amount due by the Persian Government for the service of the Imperial Persian Loan of 1911, the next coupon of which is due on the 15th proximo and requires a total of 31,250L to meet it. Up to date, we have received from our chief office in Teheran a total of 15,6231. 6 s. Id., made up as follows :— Period, 16th May to 8 th June ,, 8 th June to 8 th July ,, 8 th July to 8 th August ,, 8 th August to 8 th September The short payment for the month ended 8 th September was - - - And in the ordinary course we would have received for the month 8 th September to 8 th October - For the month. 8 th October to 8 th November- And for the period 8 th November to 15th November - ~ £ s. d. 3,864 4 11 5,208 6 8 5,208 6 8 1,342 8 4 15,023 6 i 3,865 18 4 5,208 6 8 5,208 6 8 1,344 1 9 Totalling - - 15,626 13 5 which, if received, would make the amount required foi pay ment of the coupon. But owing to the stoppage of trade m the southern poits, consequent on the war, the Persian Government have declared their inability to provide the deficiency, and unless means can be found to anange this, the payment of the coupon will have to be passed, thereby most senousL damaging the ciedit of the Persian Government, which is low enough already, in the eyes pi the British Public ; but it will also seriously affect, particularly m Persia, the prestige of the British Government whose political interests in Southern 1 ersia are of such importance, especially at the present critical time. _ The passing of the coupon is also bound to have a very damaging effect on the influence and credit of this Bank in Persia, not only from the fact of our being the issuing House, but more so, because our interests are bound up with those of the British Government in maintaining British piestige m leisia against the various Governments and Powers who are so keenly desirous to see it diminished.The amount required is not a large one, and there is ot course the probability that it may be reduced by further payments before the 15th proximo, though it would be unsafe to rely on this. The interest on the Indian Government Loan ol 290,000Z. has been regu larly paid up to 8 th September, and we assume that as it is a first charge on the Southern Customs, even the reduced receipts may enable these payments to be regularly continued. The interest on the Anglo-Indian advances of 4y0,000L has been paid up to 8 th August, but as these rank after the Persian Government Loan of 1911, payments must naturally cease until the revenue recovers. In view of the foregoing, we would take the liberty of suggesting for your consideration the question of the British and/or the Indian Government advancing to the Persian Government the amount required, with a clear stipulation that it be earmarked for the service of the Indian Government Loan and of the Persian Loan of 1911. We would point out that the amounts which have been paid since the 15th May last to the British and the Indian Governments in respect of these outstanding loans to the Persian Government are as follows :— Indian Cover nment Loan £ s. d. Paid India Office, 23rd May 1,973 14 10 5 1 23rd June 1,973 14 10 1) 28th July 1,973 14 10 ? ? 12 th September - 1,973 14 10 5 9 29th September - 1,973 14 10 Anglo-Indian Advances — Paid India Office, 23rd May 2,200 0 0 23rd June 2,200 0 0 28th July 2,200 0 0 &gt; * 12 th September - 2,200 0 0 8,800 0 0 18,668 Id 2 And, as an alternative to the above proposal, we suggest that the British and Indian Governments remit so much of the above payments on account of interest as may be required to make up the deficiency on the interest pavable by the 1 ersian Government in respect of the Public Loan of 1911, on the understanding that the amounts so remitted shall be repaid at the ’ earliest opportunity out of the Southern Customs. W 1 0 ! lld beg t0 v i 0mt out that tlle bondholders of the Public Loan of 1911 would appear to be entitled to claim remission of the interest paid in respect of the Anglo-Indian advances inasmuch as the former takes precedence o the latter, therefore the above alternative proposal only involves the P0rtl01 \ 0 r f he T P ayments whicl1 have been made since loth May 1914, m lespect of the Indian Government Loan.

If, as seems likely, Lie i ersian Government show a disposition to bargain over the offer made m Sir L. Grey’s telegram No. 252, of 5 th instant, to His Majesty’s Minister. leheran, His Lordship would suggest that before increasing it by the the pioposal of an annuity, His Majesty s Government should offer to make themselves responsible for finding the balance of the November coupon. The sum, though not large in itself, is worth considerably more than its cash value to the Peisian Government if it saves their credit. At the same time the fact that by selling the islands in the manner proposed any future difficulty in meeting the coupons will be diminished—since all prior charges on the Southern Customs will be removed— might be used as an argument to induce the Persian Government to close with the offer. If Sir E. Grey approves this course, I am to suggest that Sir W. Townley should be instructed to proceed with the least possible delay. Lord Crewe is disposed to think that it would be well to warn the Imperial Panic eonfidentialh of the proposal to cancel the Persian debts to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, as it may considerably affect their arrangements. Moreover, it wull be necessary for them to cancel their agreement of 26th May 1910 with the Persian Government. I have, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State T. W. Holderness. Foreign Office. ENCLOSURE No. 3 :—Foreign Office to India Office. No. 65,141. (Pressing.) Foreign Office, Sir, 1 st November 1914.

TJ , „ „ . to you herewith, to be laid before the October 1914 Marquess of Crewe copy- ot a further letter from the Imperial Bank of Persia on the subject. While it will be seen that a sum of over 4,500Z. has been collected since 8 th September, Sir E. Grey considers it very improbable that the whole amount due on 15th November will be found, or that the negotiations on the subject of the islands in the Persian Gulf will be sufficiently advanced by that date to allow of the arrangement with the Persian Government mentioned in your letter under reference being made. Sir E. Grey therefore hopes that Lord Crewe will share his view that in the interests of His Majesty’s Government and of the Imperial Bank it is desirable to give effect to the solution now put forward by that institution. He would, however, suggest that no announcement of this intention should be made to the Persian Government beforehand, in order that they may be stimulated to make an effort to meet their liability. I am to request the favour of a reply at your earliest convenience. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State Eyre A . Crowe. for India.

With reference to my letter of the 8 th instant on the subject of the amount received by this Bank for the payment of the coupon due loth proximo6 on the Persian Loan of 1911. I have the honour to inform you that we telegraphed to our chief office m leheran on the 22 nd instant asking what further amounts had been received on account of the coupon and if any more might be expected. We have received the following reply : “ Remitted 8 th October 3,028/., collected since about 1,500/.” From this; we understand that the deficit at the present moment may be stated at 11,099/. instead of 15,626/. as given in my letter of the 8 th instant; but I would beg to again point out that, included in the above deficiency of 11,099/. is a sum of 8,800/. which was paid over by us to the Treasury on account of interest on the Anglo-Indian loans, but which, strictly speaking, should not have been paid until the full sum required to pay the half year’s interest on the 1911 loan had first been provided. There was no reason for paying this money over when we did other than that in ordinary circumstances the revenues are sufficient for all purposes, and would have continued so if the war had not upset matters. Had we not prematurely paid the 8,800/. to His Majesty’s Government, we should thus have had in hand 28,951/. to meet the coupon amounting to 31,250/., and would have been only 2,299/. short of this amount. We hope we may yet receive further advice of payments in reduction of the 11,099/. still required, but should remittance fail we would respectfully urge that His Majesty’s Government should make up the deficiency to a maximum of 8,800/. which we prematurely paid to them. If His Majesty’s Government will assist us in this, we shall be prepared to advance the balance ourselves so so as to prevent a default. We may add that, as you are aware, we are empowered to retain all surplus revenues after providing for the interest on the Indian Loan, until the amount required for the Public Loan of 1911 has been fully provided for. I would request the favour of an early reply, as it is incumbent on us to advertise the payment of the coupon not later than the 5th November. We are already receiving many inquiries from the public regarding this, and would be glad to be in a position to answer definitely. 1 have, &amp;c.. The Under Secretary of State, T.

I entirely agree with view of Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs that no advance should be made until we are more sure of our ground. I am most unwilling to believe that present Cabinet is playing us false without conclusive proof of their treachery being produced.

Minister for Foreign Affairs called to-day, and said he fully appreciated motives which had prompted various suggestions which you had made with regard to Persia since outbreak of war. He trusted that ymen the war was over we should he able to revise 1907 agreement in a manner satisfactory to both, but he could assure me that, though Russia was willing to allow His 'Majesty’s Government to extend their sphere,, she only wished to retain what she had already got. Referring to question of proposed advance, his Excellency said that he had 100,000b at his disposal, but that he could not consent to make any advance until changes which he desired in Persian Govern ment had been carried out. He had ample proof from telegrams, of which he had acquired possession, of intrigues which present Persian Government were carrying on with Turks against Russia, and he could not therefore be expected to furnish them with funds. His Excellency then informed me that, in view of murder of Russian consul at Soujboulak, military authorities had decided to send back Russian troops to Tabriz. On my expressing hope that they would return in sufficient strength to render reverse impossible, his Excellency said that there were only some 6,000 Turks and Kurds at Tabriz, but that he did not himself know exact strength of Russian forces. Military authorities would not even have allowed them to return unless they were strong enough to cope with situation.

Persian Legation, London, 15th January, 1915.CONFIDENTIAL RUSSIA Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey —(Received January 12, 4'5 a.m.) Petrograd, January 1], 1915. (No. 38.) (January 11, 9’20 p.m.) MINISTER for Foreign Affairs came to see me yesterday to talk about Persia. His Excellency, who seemed greatly depressed, commenced by saying that were it not for the war he would place his resignation into the Emperor’s hands as the only means of escaping from impossible situation. He attached even greater value to close relations with England than with France, and all his personal feelings prevented his pursuing a policy contrary to ours. He could not, however, march in line with us if we continued to regard Russia with inveterate suspicion. We refused to recognise her vested rights and interests in North Persia, and, forgetful of process by which we had acquired our Empire in Asia, we opposed the slightest extension of Russian influence for fear of it bringing her nearer India. He had often enough been told what Russia might not do, but he would like to know what we would allow her to do and what was the definite policy of His Majesty’s Government in Persia. Natural deduction to be drawn from creation of spheres of influence in 1907 was that neither of us was entitled to interfere with what the other did in his sphere, but we had never observed this rule. If we thought our sphere too small he would let us extend it, and partition of neutral sphere was, in his opinion, the most practical solution. AVe were opposed to this owiug to our mistrust of Russia and to fear of anything in the shape of a coterminous frontier. I said it was but natural that we as an island kingdom should not desire to see India limitrophe with any Great Power, however friendly our feelings for that Power might be. We had even objected to being connected with France by a channel tunnel. Statesmen had to look ahead, and we should have to provide for defences of India even were it our friend and ally who was India’s next-door neighbour. But it was not fear of bringing Russia nearer to India, but the fact that you had attached your signature to an agreement under which Persian integrity and independence were to be maintained that made you unwilling to adopt a course that would be regarded as first step towards the partition of Persia. We did not dispute Russia’s predominant position in North Persia, and if she would only respect legitimate susceptibilities of Persian Government, Russia’s interests there could be amply safeguarded without a word of complaint on our part. When the time came for revision of the 1907 agree ment we ought, instead of embarking on a policy of partition, to endeavour to define more precisely our respective rights and obligations both in our own and neutral spheres. Referring to the next complaint his Excellency has recently made about the Persian Government, J said that latter, in asking Russian Government to withdraw their troops, had not been prompted by any hostile feeling to Russia, but by honest desire to prevent Turkish advance into Persia, which had since taken place. Russian military authorities seemed to have so ignored real situation at Tabriz that only the preceding evening the acting military attache had been informed that the town was in no danger. His Excellency admitted that he himself had not been kept accurately informed of the intentions of military authorities, and stated that there had been a succession of orders and counter-orders sent to general in command at Tabriz. He declined altogether to accept my defence of conduct of Persian Government, and accused them of persistently pursuing an anti-Russian policy, in which he regretted to say they were encouraged by His Majesty’s Legation. I denied this latter statement, saying that support which Sir W. Townley had given to request for withdrawal of Russian troops had been fullv justified by what had taken place since. [121—407]Minister for Foreign Affairs then said that he had had a long conversation with Shoa-es-Sultaneh, and that, though he did not place implicit confidence in him or any Oriental, he had been struck by his intimate knowledge of all that was going on in Persia. Speaking of the present Government, Shoa had remarked that they were quiC ■ unfit to cope with a critical situation like the present, but that Russia would not be able to get rid of them by herself, and that in order to do so she must secure co operation of England. Unfortunately his Highness had added that everybody at Tehran knew that the two legations no longer worked together, and from all that he had heard M. Korostovetz was not the proper man to represent Russia at Tehran. Referring next to your telegram No. 26 of 8th January, contents of which I had communicated to him m a private letter, his Excellency sun I that Ala-es-Sultaneh and his son must go. I then told him that in a conversation which I had had with Minister of Finance on preceding day I had spoken to his Excellency on the subject of an advance. In reply to question which he had addressed to me about suggested amount I had told him that you had not specified it in your telegram, but that Persian Minister had informed me that his Government was asking Russia and Great Britain to advance 300,000?. each. His Excellency had replied that as Minister of Finance he was opposed to any advance, but that if Minister for Foreign Affairs considered it necessary, he thought he might consent to one of 200,000?. Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he would speak to Minister of Finance, and gave me to understand that he would agree to advance this amount provided that changes desired were effected in Persian Government.should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with unless required for official use.] POLITICAL . Cypher Telegram to Sir G. Buchanan (Petrograd) Foreign Office, January 18th. 1915. 6.45.p.m. No. 67. Your telegram No. 38. The question of extension of Prussian or British in fluence respectively in Persia has not entered into any thing I have said about Persia since war began. I have been anxious that Russia should not quarrel with Persia or be aggressive to Persian Government, solely because the effect in uniting all Mussulmans on Turkish side might cause trouble in India and Egypt/that would im pair our strength in the war in Europe. Also it seemed to me that the action of Russian Of ficials in Northern Persia was not calculated to serve Rus sian intere-sts against Turkey. I thought there were two possible courses for Russia to pursue. 1. To send sufficient Russian troops to drive Turks out of Azerbaijan and stop their advance into Northern Persia. 2. To withdraw Russian troops and get credit at ,oneran for doing so, thereby either securing opposition o Persians to Turks or else if Persian Government did not re sist the Turks and sided with them acquiring the right for Russia to take things into her own hands later on when she was abler to do so. The employment of Shuja seemed worse than useless, because it began with a quarrel with the Persian Government and was bound to end in failure against Turkey. Y/hetherhussia adopted course 1 or 2 it was for 3ier to decide, but it is unfortunate that the Russian officials did not adopt either. They have now incurred the odium of having used bhuJa against ohe will of Persian Government, tne withdrawal of Lussian troops has taken place but hussia has got no credit for it at Teheran, on the contrary it ao- pears to. Persian Government as if they owed the withdrawal to the advance of the Turks. I would therefore earnestly ask Minister for Foreign Affairs to believe that any suggestions I have made about Persia during the war have been influenced by a feeling of the solidarity of Russian and British interests in the war and a belief that neither Russian nor British interests were being served by the policy pursued by Russian official in Persia. For me the sole consideration is whether policy pur sued in Persia is likely 4 to help or hinder the progress of the war. During the war the Persian question does not exist for me apart from its effect on the war. I hope that Russian victories in the Caucasus will far outweigh strategically any ground gained by Turkey in Persia, but I fear that Turkey has gained a certain diplo matic footing and goodwill in Persia that may be embarrass ing in the Mussulman world generally, which is a matter of serious consequence to us. ■.'•/hat military steps can be taken to recover lost ground it is for Russia to decide. Diplomatically I can see nothing except to attach Persian Government to our side by meeting the pressing re quest that they are making for an advance of £100,000, V/e would advance half of this if Russia agreed to advance the other. Does Minister for Foreign Affairs think this desirable and if so on what conditions? It is no good making stiff or disagreeable conditions now, if we are to make the advance at all.

They had suffered in revenue, as many other countries were suffering at this moment, and they wished to have a moratorium with reo-ard to the instalments due on previous loans.

The Minister admitted, in reply to a question, that there was no security to be offered for this new loan, except certain new taxes, including one on opium, and the royalties on oil produced in leisia. 1 said that I should have to consider this with the India Office and the Russian Government, which would take a little time.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 14.) (No. 269.) Sir, Tehran, November 11, 1914. WITH reference to my telegram No. 274 of the 17th September, I have the honour to traosmit herewith copy of a note w r hich I have received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs setting forth that, in consequence of the war, the revenues of the southern customs have fallen off to such an extent that it is feared they will not suffice to meet the service of the various loans and advances secured upon them, and Asking that the above-mentioned service may be suspended for one year, and the Persian Government permitted to encash the entire revenues of the southern customs. The note further calls the attention of the British and Russian Governments to the financial situation of Persia, and requests that a joint advance of 3,000,000 tomans (about 500,000Z.), may be made to the Persian Government by the two Governments. A similar note was addressed to the Russian Legation, to w T hom a request was equally made that the payments from the northern customs receipts may be postponed for one year. At an interview subsequent to the reception of the note with the Prime Minister, at which the Ministers of Finance and Foreign Affairs were present, I represented the unreasonableness of Persia making such a request without even hinting at how it was proposed that the money would be secured and eventually refunded. No attempt was even made, I showed, to indicate from what source the service of the interest of the new advance was to be derived, whilst it was not encouraging to see in the same note an appeal for the postponement of the service of the already existing loans and advances. Mustaufi-el-Mamelek replied that there was no hope for Persia if the question was to be treated from a purely business point of view, but that the Government had relied in making the request upon the long-tried benevolence towards Persia of the British Government. To this I answered that this was a sentimental policy, and that the days of sentiment appeared to me to have given place to those of common sense, and that, moreover, I was by no means sure that the sentimental policy adopted towards Persia in the past in financial matters had not contributed rather to her undoing than to her welfare. Succeeding Governments had learnt too readily to trust to the goodwill of friends and had not. for that reason, made sufficiently strenuous efforts to make the resources of Persia suffice for her needs. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. No. 1. t ] / Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum communicated to Sir W. Townley by Ala-us-Sultaneh. (Translation ^ THE Persian Government lias the honour to inform the British Government that, owing to the war in Europe, Persian trade with foreign countries is passing thiough a grave crisis, which has reduced the customs revenues of the country. If tie war between the European Powers is not brought to a speedy conclusion it is feaied tlia the condition of the customs will continue to get worse. It is also feared that, even after the war, the commercial relations with foreign countries will not lecover t leir normal condition for several months. In these circumstances it is almost certain that the fall in the customs revenue, which is the result of the present war, will prevent the Persian Government repaying its debts, that is to say, the advances made on the security of the revenues or t e southern customs. . . , In the countries at war a respite for a certain time has been gi\en, an anange2 ments have been made to prevent as much as possible the bankruptcy of those who have suffered by the war. The Persian Government is not directly implicated in this war, but there can be no doubt that owing to its position Persia has suffered from the serious consequences of the hostilities, which have effected its revenues in an incredible manner. The Persian Government earnestly hope that His Majesty’s Government will take these circumstances into consideration and see whether it is possible that for one year, i.e., until October 1915, the repayment of the instalments on loans and advances made by arrangement with the British Government, and amounting to more than 10,OOOZ. a month, can be postponed, and the whole of the customs revenue of the south be left at the disposal of the Persian Government for the above-mentioned year. The Persian Government earnestly hope that as soon as their foreign commercial relations resume their former condition the customs revenue will increase, and that it will not be obliged to delay the repayment of the interest and the sinking funds more than one year. The Persian Government trust that this request will be met favourably by His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and that the surplus revenue of the customs of the south will be put at its disposal. It is time that the Persian Government should draw the attention of the British and Russian Governments to the most difficult position of the Persian treasury, and the grave crisis through which it has been passing during a whole year. The reason of this grave situation is the expenses which the Persian Government has had to bea on account of the frequent troubles created during the last four years by the tribes. These incidents not only have caused great expense to the Persian Government, but on account of the plunder of various districts and the damage done to the harvests in the country for several years have greatly affected the collection of the internal revenue, so that the revenues foreseen in the budget have not been collected. The Persian Government is confident that there will be no difficulty in the British and Russian Governments realising the genuineness of the above statements, and that they will agree that the Persian Government have not failed to take suitable measures to remedy this state of affairs. Since the Persian Government cannot by its own resources improve the situation, it has perfect hope in the assistance of the British and Russian Governments, who have not refused it on similar occasions, and request that a joint loan of 3,000,000 tomans be made to the Persian Government. The latter think that this sum will be sufficient to meet tlm present requirements of the treasury, amounting to 2,500,000 tomans. When this is done the Persian Government will be able to improve its position and carry out with confidence the measures now under consideration by the Cabinet, until such a time as the finances of the country shall have recovered their normal position.

Sir, Foreign Office, December 14, 1914. THE Persian Minister spoke to me to-day about the collection of taxes in the north of Persia. He said that there was due to the Persian Government about 60,000L of these taxes; the taxes had been collected by the Russians, who had not paid them over to the Persians. I said that, in discussing with the Russian Government the question of a loan to Persia, about which the Minister had spoken to me to-day, I would bear in mind the difficulty about Shuja-ed-Dowleh, which the Minister had just mentioned to me, and the difficulty about the revenue in the north of Persia.

It will be seen that, in order to prevent a default on the part of Persia in respect to a public loan, His Majesty’s Government decided to refund a portion of the interest paid to them on account of the Anglo-Indian advances subsequent to 1911. The sum of 7,184Z. 9s. id. was accordingly paid by this Office to the Imperial Bank of Persia on the 7th De cember 1914, a moiety of that amount (3,592/. 4s.

Up to date, we have received from our chief office in Teheran a total of 15,623L 65 . 7d., made up as follows :— Period, 16th May to 8 th June 3,864 •S. 4 a. 11 ,, 8 th June to 8 th July 5.208 6 8 ,, 8 th July to 8 th August 5,208 6 8 ,, 8 th August to 8 th September 1,342 8 4 The short payment for the month ended 8 th 15,623 6 7 September was - - - 3,865 18 4 And in the ordinary course v T e would have received for the month 8 th September to 8 th October _ _ _ _ 5,208 6 8 For the montii 8 th October to 8 th November- 5,208 6 8 And for the period 8 th November to 15th November _ _ _ 1,344 1 9 Totalling 15,626 13 5 which, if received, would make the amount required for payment of the coupon. But owing to the stoppage of trade in the southern ports, consequent on the war, the Persian Government have declared their inability to provide the deficiency, and unless means can be found to arrange this, the payment of the coupon will have to lie passed, thereby most seriously damaging the credit of the Persian Government, which is low enough already, in the eyes of the British Public; but it will also seriously affect, particularly in Persia, the prestige of the British Government whose political interests in Southern Persia are of such importance, especially at the present critical time. The passing of the coupon is also bound to have a very damaging effect on the influence and credit of this Bank in Persia, not only from the fact of our being the issuing House, but more so, because our interests are bound up with those of the British Government in maintaining British prestige in Persia against the various Governments and Powers who are so keenly desirous to see it diminished.4 The amount required is not a large one, and there is of course the probability that it may be reduced by further payments before the 15th proximo, though it would be unsafe to rely on this. The interest on the Indian Government Loan ot 290,000L has been regu larly paid up to 8th September, and we assume that as it is a first charge on the Southern Customs, even the reduced receipts may enable these payments to be regularly continued. The interest on the Anglo-Indian advances of 490,COOL has been paid up to 8th August, but as these rank after the Persian Government Loan of 1911, payments must naturally cease until the revenue recovers. ' In view of the foregoing, we would take the liberty of suggesting for your consideration the question of the British and/or the Indian Government advancing to the Persian Government the amount required, with a clear stipulation that it be earmarked for the service of the Indian Government Loan and of the Persian Loan of 1911. We would point out that the amounts which have been paid since the 15th May last to the British and the Indian Governments in respect of these outstanding loans to the Persian Government are as follows :— Indian Gover mnent Loan £ s. d. Paid India Office, 23rd May 1,973 14 10 5 1 23rd June 1,973 14 10 5* 28th July 1,973 14 10 ?? 12th September - 1,973 14 10 &gt; &gt; 29lh September - 1,973 14 10 Anglo-1 ndian Advances — Paid India Office, 23rd May 2,200 0 0 23rd June 2,200 0 0 n 28th July 2,200 0 0 12th September - 2,200 0 0 8,800 0 0 18,668 14 2 And, as an alternative to the above proposal, we suggest that the British and Indian Governments remit so much of the above payments on account of interest as may be required to make up the deficiency on the interest pavable by the Persian Government in respect of the Public Loan of 1911, on the understanding that the amounts so remitted shall be repaid at the earliest opportunity out of the Southern Customs. We would beg to point out that the bondholders of the Public Loan of 1911 would appear to be entitled to claim remission of the interest paid in respect of the Anglo-Indian advances inasmuch as the former takes precedence of the lattei. Fherefore the above alternative proposal only involves the remission of a ^ portion of the payments which have been made since 15th May 1914, in respect of the Indian Government Loan.

In the circumstances, it seems desirable to consider financial situation which is roughly, as follows, some 80,000 tomans remain out of the £40,000 lent for Pars Gendarmerie, and 1 reckon debts of the gendarmerie and army to British subjects and or goo s or ere xom British firms at about 40,000 tomans. If then we expend ^ole of the remaining balance in paying gendarmerie, we shall in a few months time find ourselves left with force of 2,000 men for_ whose “amtenance no tunds are available and with outstanding British claims of about 40 ’ 000 lo ^ it is doubtful if force can be kept together pending four or five months lo g unless Persian Government can furnish its proper share of expenses.

The subject has often been discussed between the Governor-General and myselj^and His Excellency has assured me that it could be done. Swedes, Gendarmerie and Belgians are all to go. This would spell a return to the old conditions of intertribal fighting, rahdari and chaos. On excellent authority, I have recently heard that, with this object in view, he has entered into negotiations with Sowlet and Kawam. The Ispahan road will be kept by Kawam while Sowlet will look after Bushire, whilst Governor-General, with the assistance of the local force and the tw*o chiefs named, will himself (manage the province ?). He has also, I understand, placed these projects before the Persian Gov ernment. To-morrow I hope to meet Sowiet and after I have had a talk with him will again telegraph. Enclosure No. d.

There are only about 1,200 tomans left of the money allotted to Kerman. That sum is at disposal of gendarmerie. I believe, however, that as Govern ment cannot pay outstanding debts to gendarmerie amounting to about 210,000 tomans and guarantee future regular payments, all the Swedes have agreed to resign. Should this happen, all debts due to British firms by gendarmerie should form first call en 12,000 tomans and care should be taken to recover arms in hands of gendarmerie before they are disbanded. I see small hope of settlement, but the Government may yet make a sacrifice to situation. Enclosure No. 9. Te’egram R., No. 157, dated the 31st October 1914.

Unless the R ussia n bank provides funds, it would seem impossible that gendarmerie can be maintained.

I have discussed question of Oendarmerie fully with Governor General, Uggla and Stas. We are all of opinion that their withdrawal from the road would he followed by recrudescence of disorders and that we should post pone this measure as long as possible in the hope that a 'modus vivendi' may be arrived at later. My proposal is, therefore, that we should furnish them with three further instalments of 15,000 tomans each of British money, which, together with what Stas can contribute, will enable them to remain on road for another two months, and some 35,000 tomans (£ 1000) would still remain to pay debts to British firms. In interval we propose that plan should be formulated for future existence and organization of affairs of force. We are all of opinion that present force might be reduced by about one third, and consider that economies might be effected in other ^ifn wtii directions which would bring cost within powers of provincial revenue. If it can be arranged for some Swedish officers to j remain, I suggest suitable officer should be sent from North to replace Uggla. Failing Swedes, there would seem to De no reason why Merrill, who left Shiraz on November 3nd for Tehran, should not be employed. Governor General principally desires to maintain local force and has, I believe, made detailed proposals to iearan. Chief difficulty here is that no one knows what are really the intentions of the Persian Government themselves. Way could no doubt be found out of present impasse but, failing guidance from Tehran, local authorities are groping in the dark. 0 f Connor.Telegram R. Prom - Minister, Tehran.

It is most satisfactory that you, Uggla, Stas and Governor General should have discussed Gendarmerie question amicably and that you should all be in accord in regard to the necessityof forces retention. I entirely agree with you and I am quite ready to do my best to further payment 45,000 tomans in three instalments or in one lump sum, whichever you may consider desirable. I am sure Persian Government are sincerely anxious to maintain Gendarmerie, and all their hesitation and apparent indecision upon the subject is merely due to financial situa tion and to their consequent inability to make plans for the future. I am promised that a Senior Officer, either Carlberg or a new man from Sweden will be sent to Shiraz, preferably former who has proved himself a capable officer at Xazvin. Even if present mission fails, I have reason to think that some officers, and not the worst, will remain. Townley.In any further communication on the subject, please quote no. 80771/14.

Taking into consideration^ the nature o the force and the short time it has had for acquiring practical traming and mora. discipline, and also having regard to the qualifications of the Swedish Officers I consider two officers insufficient even for the organization and supervision or protective measures on the Kerman Bandar Abbas Road. Neither of the two officers now remaining has had any training in Cavalry work.

Ahhas Road It was for this special reason that the Gendar merie were original sent to Kerman. When that object has been attained, the : nex' most important matter is the protect.on of the Kerman-Yezd route. Later the question of the necessity and possibility of linking up Bam with the Kerman-Bandar Abbas system by a spec.al connecting hne over the Deh Bakri pass might be taken into consideration. The Rawar and Khabis routes to Kerman are normally as far as 1 know, safe enough. What is required at those places is adequate defence against strong Baluch raids, and this a single Company at each place would scarcely seem to provide. 4 1 would further suggest that an ambitious scheme of distribution will nrobably fail to yield entirely happy results, in the absence of a sufficient staff of European Officers to exercise a close and constant supervision over the scat- tered detachments. ct As regards the scheme for the Bandar Abbas Road I can offer no criti cism of minor details as I have not myself been over the route. 1 can only dis cuss matters of general principle. I note that there will be 19 Posts for some 2^0 miles Of these 14 consist of only 4 or 5 men. The strongest Posts, omit ting Bandar Abbas which scarcely counts as part of the road, are four in number and have garrisons of 27 officers and men. 6 . There therefore seems to be great diffusion of force and hence weakness. Even a body of 24 Gendarmes cannot supply both a strong escort and an adequate force to leave in charge of its post. The posts of 4 , 5 , and 8 men with onlv 1 and 2 horses are I suppose only intended to act as connecting posts for the conveyance of news and orders, etc., but even so they allow practically no margin for sickness of men or horses. Moreover they seem to me to invite attack and on the North-West Frontier of India they would most certainly be cut up and their arms carried off. Things are different here, bat I un ® r ' stand that the existence of danger on the road is anticipated. ^ In this case the dispersion of men in small parties would seem to be offering a bait to the enemy. 7. The total strength you propose to employ is only 353 officers and men of whom 109 are mounted. 1 had thought you had contemplated employing a much larger force and that you had serious anxiety in regard to the Ahmadi quarter, where to secure yourselves you wanted to have at your ^ disposal Mountain Guns. I now gather that you propose to post in the Ahmadi Section only 1 Company of 2 Persian Officers, 2 Under Officers, 6 Corporals and 73 Gendarmes, broken up into 6 detachments. Even if the two adjoining posts at either end of this section are counted in, for the stretch from Deh ^ ar(i t0 Dahanah-i-Tang, we get a total strength of only 2 Persian Officers, 4 Under Officers, 10 Corporals, 108 Gendarmes. The space covered is approximately 00 miles of Bill country and the number of posts is to. 8. You have I understand something between 5 00 an d 600 men; would it not be safer in the first instance to employ the whole of these, with at least 1 Swedish Officer, on the road ? The force could be reduced later if found to be in excess of requirements. I would also suggest that there spems to be no neces sity for the disproportionately large number of^ 54 men in the town of Bandar Abbas. I cannot myself see what purpose men in Bandar Abbas will serve. 9. Personally I think that if I were myself trying to protect the road with a moderate number of troops, 1 would concentrate my men in stronger bodies in a reduced number of posts, and send through strong Escorts with caravans, each escort if necessary accompanying the caravan for 2 or more stages. With a small force one cannot hope to render permanently secure each of the 270 miles or so of the road. It could easily be arranged that not more than one authorised caravan should traverse the road in each direction per week or per fortnight. to. I would 1 think concentrate my main force somewhere in the Ahma 1 Section which is both central and appears to be the chief danger centre, dhes main force would be in charge of a European Officer who would be able to eo on with the training of the corps and of recruits. The men at the other posts would be periodically relieved and brought in for training to this headquarters, others beinff sent thence to replace them. s n. As regards quarters the detachments could in the first instance live in tents round which they would construct entrenchments and sangars Tents can be made inhabitable even in the hot weather by building rough reed or grass shelters over them. s I2 * ^ ou w i !1 see that m y views a PP ear to differ considerably from your own. I have only offered them in deference to your request. You are the person responsible for results and it is you who have investigated the conditions on the spot; I would not dream of forcing my notions on you, nor, where I have no control, of accepting responsibility for the results should they be adopted. The main principles in which I believe and to which I would try to give effect, are concentration of effort, concentration of forces, and the minimum of delegation of independent authority or responsibility to Native Ranks.

I am convinced that in taking this step, which they say is considerably less extensive in its aims than demand^) they have been advised by Russian Minister himself to put forward, Persian Government are acting solely on their own initiative and have not been animated by Turkish or other advisers. Members of Cabinet are of opinion that pt is in Persia’s best interests to maintain truly strict neutrality, against violations of which they will protest impartially. Their sympathies are certainly rather with us than against us, but they fear public opinion would disapprove ot open espousal of the cause of the two neighbouis wffio alone can do them real harm or real good. Situation is and must remain a most delicate one. There is naturally a strono- party with pro-Islamic tendencies, but I am given to understand |_?that this] party has been losing ground of late before arguments put forward by strong and influential clerical-political party that favours an alliance with us. The clerical section of this party, with whom I am on friendly terms, has sent me spontaneous assurances that during ensuring first ten days of Moharrem no pro-Turkish sermons will be preached, and advantages of siding with us will be sedulously put before the people. Messages have also been sent to Ulemas of Mespotamia and of Shiah faithfully telling them programme of Persian Government, and that priests do not favour a Turkish policy, and exhorting them not to preach holy war, of an intention to do which there have been some signs at Mohammerah and Kermanshah. So far situation is favourable, but any incident, such as a Turkish success or some thoughtless treatment of a mullah by Russians, as has recently occurred at Kermanshah, may inflame public opinion and turn people against us. New Medjliss, which must be opened soon, may prove dangerous body, as it is largely composed of priests. I have advised the Cabinet to arrange with present majority, which is well-disposed, to so contrive matters that as soon as officers of the house have been chosen and committees formed, for which work will be found, house sh ill vote itself holidays, so as not to remain permanently sitting.

Situation is as follows. Owing to dearth of money and depression of trade due to war, Stas is experiencing great difficulty in collecting revenue. We hope however that it may be possible to collect sufficient to pay for gendarmerie and other essential expenses of provincial budget to end of current year. But even so we shall then find ourselves in same situation again and either gendar merie must collapse from lack of funds or fresh loan will ha.ve to be made. I discussed situation with Uggla yesterday. He is of opinion that even if gendarmerie are disbanded in north Persia, Pars regiment can still be continued under Swedish officers if Swedish Government will consent to latter remaining. Collapse of gendarmerie here would be deplorable hi HrtHinurfiirt ^mr and would inevitably lead to renewal of robberies rahdari and other abuses. I will submit other alternative proposals if Your Excellency desires but meanwhile I trust that it may be found possible to arrange for their retention at any rate until end of current year or until funds definitely give out.

I have addressed General Officer Commanding on the subject! I am also giad that you and Governor-General are agreed about the undesir ability of the appointment of a Kashgai Chief to the Governorship of Kazerun. Ain-ed-Dowleh, in whose judgment 1 have much faith, did not consider idea an objectionable one, provided it had Saulet’s approval, but you and Governor- General who are on the spot are the best judges of a question which it would he haid fot me to decide here and impossible for London to pronounce upon. I do not quite follow your line of argument when you apparently consider gendarmerie should have no hacking from any ot local tribes or entities. It appears to me hardly possible that a diminutive force of 1,800 men can maintain themselves against all comers unless they can rely upon moral outward support of all powerful factions loyal to Persian Government. This support should however bo secured for them by good offices of Governor-General. All danger of creating jealousy or an appearance of loophole to one party more than another should thereby be removed. lean see no hope of situation at Kazerun improving as long as the insufficient force of gendarmerie stationed there is confronted by a numerically much stronger hostile force. ,We have told baulet that we look to him for actions and not for assurances only and it would appear hardly consistent to dispossess his tribe of all chance of proving their loyalty by refusing to accept their assistance on score that it would appear, if this were done, that gendarmerie are too weak to stand alone. It must be patent to all that this is the case and one can hardly expect it of a handful of men who represent a Government force unless they can rely on backing of loyal tribes, if, as should be case, Governor-General takes matter in hand, there should be no cause for jealousy on Kavvam’s part as there is no intention of using the gendarmerie to weaken or belittle him. I entirelv disagree with much that you say about the work done by gendarmes. They have no doubt made many grievous mistakes, but it should in fairness to them be remembered that under strong pressure they have undertaken most difficult task with a quite insufficiently large force and that no time was given to them to drill the ^whilom?) brigands whom they had to enlist into any semblance of a decent fighting force. It is not clear yet who will finance Pars gendarmerie for the future, but the Persian Government are being urged to leave no stone unturned to do it themselves, even if it is not something of a stretch of the imagination to talk of the justification of our raising money which is advanced on sound security at seven per cent, per annum repayable in three or four years.1 1 222 I personally strongly opP^ g.n, Z ™k‘?n tS, ta S,“nS,J *.«.■,‘to &gt;■*“* toi'3 in connection with Luristan Railway Survey.

From-The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To -The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Following from Acting Consul, Shiraz, 3rd April “ I received telegram last night from Uggla from Kazerun savin* that essen ml question was to find suitable Governor for that place, and that as Kazerun was centre of Kashgai tribes, in his opinion, Kashgai Governor should be appointed And he says he is writing to Saulet to ask whether he would accept appointment for one of his brothers preferably Saulet Sultaneh. I have replied that I am consulting you and urging him to take no steps whatever in the matter until I have ascertained your views. My opinion on the subiect is somewhat as follows: I have always regarded gendarmerie as neutral force which should not identify itself with any local or tribal group in particular but which should, if possible, remain impartially on good terms with all and keep balance between Kashgai and Khamseh, keep open road, and assist in maintaining order generally in province. I have always held^ that moment they mingle with local politics o’r identify themselves with any particular faction their utility will become to a great extent impaired and object of their presence here will be to a great extent defeated. Gendarmerie in fact must, in my opinion, be impartial and indepen dent. I am therefore on these grounds against Uggla’s proposal which will necessarily be regarded all over the province and by Kawam especially as direct alliance with Saulet. But besides this I am opposed to the suggestion on other giounds. Past history of the road has shown how undesirable was Kashgai’s interference there and from day I arrived here I have been working to diminish Kashgai influence on road and to remove all pretext for their interference. Moment we have Kashgai Governor of Kazerun all the old intrigues and difficulties will recommence. More follows.

I had already discussed this f llid&gt; very question with Uggla and he knows my views, and I do not understand why he should suddenly have sprung new policy upon us. I fear it is that he now sees that gendarmerie are too weak and too discredited to maintain themselves on road without Kashgai support. If this is so, and in my opinion it is actually case,^ sooner we dispense with gendarmerie altogether the better. When we consider recent events, and present situation on road, it must be admitted that, in view of the heavy cost of gendarmerie^ nothing could well be more unsatisfactory. They have twice been on verge of extinction at Kazerun, and have lost to brigands property valued at many tens of thousands of tomans and quantity of rifles and ammunition. They only hold lower section of road by means of heavy subsidies paid to Khans, and they are obliged to call in local Khans even to guard Kazerun where there is gendarmerie force of four hundred men. They have wrought destruction at Kazerun which will seriously hamper trade for many years to come. Their entire lack of discipline renders them dangerous rather than useful on road, and they have antagonised entire province by their misconduct. Ali Mahomet, brigand, whom they have been trying to catch for months and Nasir-i-Divan are still at large. If now they are compelled to call in Kashgais to secure their position, I venture to suggest, for consideration, whether game is worth the220 candle, and whether™ are justified in spending 150,000 pounds a year to support this organisation. If Saulet’s help is required, let us demand aud pay lor it ° ourselves as suggested in my telegram* • Serial No. 211 . ^ 24 . It is clearly preferable that we should keep strings of Pars’ politics in our own hands to pull or not as we think fit than to hand them over to Swedes who have proved themselves utterly incompetent and who, I regret to say, are not at heait iriend y to us Or concerned for our interests.

In view of the fact that Shiraz situation is now engaging attention at Tehran, I venture to put forward few observations for Your Excellency’s consideration. Present system of main taining order in Fars hy means of Swedish gendarmerie is calculated to cost about £ 150,000 yearly, and as I venture to think that our object is being to great extent defeated by unsuitable manner in which gendarmerie duties are being carried out, I need not repeat observations which I have already submitted to Your Excellency on this point, but I wish now to emphasize how undesirable it is for us from all points of view to be associated with proceedings of foreign officers whose whole probable manner of treating orientals differs from ours and who have now succeeded in alienating all classes in Fars. When I first came to Shiraz I was pleased to find that, in spite of events of the two previous years, general feeling of respect and liking for the British still existed. Such feeling is assuredly of incalculable value to us in Southern Persia and its loss would be irretrievable mis fortune. I veuture to submit for consideration whether it is worth our while to continue to expend large sums of money on an organisation which, I fear, may have effect of alienating these friendly sentiments. As to question of what could replace Swedish gendarmerie in Fars assuming that employment of British officers is not advisable, I venture to submit following tentative suggestions:— First. Appointment of Governor-General friendly to our interests and prepared to co-operate cordially with British Consul and European officials and to accept their advice. Second. Liberal subsidies to Saulat and Kawam. Third. Maintenance of small regular force about 2,000 men commanded by officer of some neutral power and officered by Persians. Fourth. Annual subvention towards cost of provincial administrations. Arrangement should not cost us more than 30,000 to 40,000 pounds yearly, assuming that revenue of Fars is expended within province under proper European control, and this expenditure would give us locus standi for display of practical interest in conduct of administration. I venture to think also that as bulwark against Russian agression some such arrangemect ensuring as it would goodwill of entire population, especially if combined with subsidation of the Bakhtiaris, would be infinitely superior to present policy of financing Swedish gendarmerie which is unduly expensive for results obtained and which has disorganised whole province. They merely exist now by virtue of our backing. If that were withdrawn they would be swept away immediately. This is only outline of my suggestions. I am submitting despatch to elaborate them more fully.’ “ Kindly repeat to Government of India.” 212 Telegram, No. 362, dated the 29th (received 30th) March 1914.

I find that summary given in my telegram* 90 is correct. Looting of town began on the night of 3rd March and was in full swing when Colonel Merrill arrived on the 4th March.

I regret to say that Colonel Merrill’s efforts were not very warmly supported by Swedish officers and, as far as is known, no gendarme has been punished. Tufangchis employed by gendarmes also took prominent part in pillage. Looted articles are be*in°' now brought into Shiraz and are being collected by Colonel Uggla pending receipt of instructions from General Officer Commanding as to their disposal.

(roughly speaking, at the present rate of exchange 650,OOO tomans), made to the Persian Government by the Imperial Bank in March 1913, would be repaid, and the remainder of the money would be available for alTocpte rr S - it, he Perslai1 Government had declared their unwillingness to allocate all the northern revenues as a security for the loan, and had proposed that 50 per cent, only of the land tax of certain districts, including Resht and Tabriz should be paid tnrough the Banque d’Esconipte, the Government reserving the right to pay the remainder into any other banking institution it chose. No special bank was named, but M. Korostovetz jumped to the conclusion that the Imperial Bank was intended, and reported m that sense to Petrograd. I expressed my regret that I had been kept in the dark about the negotiations on 00 fl ,? Ca ^ Se 1 saw ™° objectlan ^ a11 to tiie Government making such an arrangement with the Banque d Escompte Ihe agreement made with the Imperial Bank had been for one year only, and would have expired last March had the Treasurer-General been m a position to refund the loan made. The Imperial Bank could claim no monopoly of these financial transactions, though I contended that the Persian Government had a perfect right to make such arrangements with it if it was convenient to do so, fust as j they could with the Banque d’Escompte. What I held was that each institution'should ^ t jM^allyand that it could not be argued that the Anglo-Russian Convention I °f 1907 had overriden the Bank’s Charter of 1888. M. Korostovetz said that he had not intentionally concealed the matter from me, and that he had told the Persian authorities to discuss it with me. We then talked the whole matter over, and I said that it seemed to me, as I had often said previously, that it was in the interest of all parties to arrive at a modus vivendi. I agreed that it was but natural that the Russian Government should wish mat the Russian Bank should be in a position to do Government business in those places where Russian interests were predominant. That this had been recognised when the 1913 agreement with the Imperial Bank was concluded was apparent from the fact that the revenues of the province of Azerbaijan were expressly excluded from the arrangement. I suggested that the requirements of all parties might be satisfied if it was agreed that a portion of the maliat of such places as Kermanshah, Hamadan, buitanabad, Ispahan, and Yezd, where British interests are important, was paid into the Imperial Bank. It would be a distinct violation of the old-established charter of that institution were its business with the Government to be confined solely to the much less prosperous neutral and British zones. The manager of the Imperial Bank much resents any restriction of the bank’s sphere of action, and technically his contention is absolutely just. At the same time it does seem very desirable that some arrangement should be reached that would satisfy ussian pretensions. There is small doubt that the arbitrary seizure of the taxes due from Russians and Russian-protected persons by the Russian consuls was primarily due to jealousy of the fact that, under the 1913 arrangement, the northern revenues, with the exception of those of Azerbaijan, were hypothecated to the Imperial Bank! 11. liorostoyetz assured me that the collection of these revenues would be handed back to the Persian officials as soon as this question was settled, and that all that would be insisted upon would be that the consuls would be advised of the exact amount of tax claimed from each Russian landowner, protected persons being excluded. It must [2286 6 — 1 ] 7 to fndfa 4 DEC 1514 1 it 12 also be borne in mind that the Persian financial authorities are at liberty to make what loan they can on the security of the northern revenues when once the Imperial Banks ^““Lia sXsoCienfconversation with the Chef de Cabinet of the Minister of Foreign*' '\ (fairs I learned that the Government does not propose to conclude the proposed arrangement with the Banque d’Escompte, for the present at all events, and that the I p rim e Minister is much averse to the conclusion of any agreement which would underline the demarcation of the zones of influence It is lor this reason that he proposed that only 50 per cent, of the revenues should be hypothecated to the Banque d’Escompte, reserving to the Government the right to do business on the security of the remaining half with whomsoever they liked. . . T . , T , , , M Sazonofs endeavour to restrict tlie sphere ot action ot the Imperial hank, and to argue that the establishment of fresh branches in the Russian zone is contrary to the spirit of the 1907 Convention, is unreasonable. It should be remembered that the peculiar and illegal practice of the Russian Bank, under which, m distinct violation of the letter of its concession, it has taken possession of large tracts of country on mortgage, has caused a large portion of Northern Persia to pass under the sole control of Russian consuls. These officers and the officers of the Russian Bank are not very particular as to the legal rights of people to whom money is advanced on the security of lands that do not belong in many cases to the borrower. M. bazonot has denied that the Russian Government had the intention of extending protection to that arch brigand, Naib Hussein of Kashan, but it can easily be established beyond contradiction that the bank manager at Ispahan, with the assistance of the consul-geneial, had practicallv concluded a short time ago an arrangement with the outlaw under which all the properties he has stolen would have been taken undei the management ot the , hank. Consuls and bank managers have found by experience that a fait accompli i usually receives the official sanction of 1 etiograd m the long run. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY.

Knox, I.A., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to submit to you the Allowing report on the work and character of the Swedish officers deputed at the end of last year to raise a Gendarmerie force in the Kerman Province. The matter appears to me to be one of considerable importance, not merely from the point of view of the probable success or failure of the scheme in securing the objects aimed at, but also having regard to wider issues at stake, 2. Such a scheme cannot be carried out, whether to success or failure? without producing great changes or developments in the relations between Euro* peans and the natives of the province.^ Wisdom, discretion and intelligence on the part of the Gendarme officers will increase the prestige of Europeans, regard less of their nationality. Folly, indiscretion and stupidity or mere incompetence will tend to bring all Europeans in-o contempt, if not to make them actually hated and to make the handling of the local population in the futuie a work of greatly increased difficulty. Such possible contingencies arising in the British sphere are too serious to be a matter of indifference to the British and Indian Governments, who at any time, now or 50 years hence, may be driven by circumstances into assuming some degree of active control over the Southern provinces of Persia, or at least into taking effective steps to ameliorate the state of affairs then obtaining there. A policy or measure which but indifferently met the needs of the moment, while definitely increasing the difficulties of the future would be opposed to all true statesmanship. It is with this in my mind that I propose to review the operations of the Swedes as they have come under my notice in this province It is impossible for one living on the spot not to have arrived at a tolerably definite opinion on such a matter, but I shall endeavour to state what I know and feel with all the fair-mindedness of which I am capable. 3. The nucleus of the Gendarmerie arrived in Kerman on October 24th, 1913, and consisted of some 200 men and 4 Swedish Officers. Of these former I understand that only some 150 were fighting men. Of the Swedes two had been two years in the country, but two had only just arrived in Persia and had no know ledge of the language or the people. One of these, Major Lychnell, was a non- combatant, an “ Intendant ,, l or Quartermaster as we should call it. After their arrival all these officers suffered intermittently from fever, and two of them including the Commandant, developed enteric. Major Glimstedt, the Commandant, was only able to commence active duty at Christmas, and Captain Oertingren was on the sick list from some time in November till the end of Jan uary. To the significance of all this illness I shall return later, but considered C114FD India, Foreign Secreiarys ftmerely as an unfortunate fact it must have very seriously handicapped the earlier efforts of the Swedes to recruit and or^an se a force. Captain de Mar0 who was in almost sole administrative charge for the best part of two months, is a man of vigour and push and deserves praise for accomplishing so much as he did. I shall now deal with the work done so far as I am acquainted with it following roughly the logical and historical order of development. Organisation ana Recruiting. 4, Immediately on arrival the Swedes occupied what Government quarters they could find vacant. In securing these they were much assisted by the fact that there was at the time no Governor General or Governor’s following in the place. Thev also at once set vigorously to building new additional quarters, stables, kitchens and so forth. In this line they have throughout been extremely active making no allowance for the fact that the Gendarmerie is designed for use on the roads, and that there is no raison d'etre for them in towns where at the most all they should eventually require is training depdts. The chef d'ceuure has teen a huge dining hall about 117 by 63 feet, a most expensive and unneces sary form of building Owing to lack of funds its construction, } finished, has now had to be abandoned. When they take up their duty the Gendarmerie will have to be scattered in detachments, and it would have been advisable to acquire experience in developing a system of company or section kitchens and messes, such as is in vogue among both British and Indian troops in India. Recruiting. 5. Whe-i the force arrived here in October it may be taken to have been about 200 strong, and to have consisted of men at least partially trained includ ing eisjht Persian Officers. The official programme was — “ during the winter to call into existence a force of some 600 men, and in spring (1914) to send them out on to the road”. This, I have always maintained, was aiming at impossibilities and the Swedes’ programme now, after a little experience, is to raise the force to 1,061 men by tne end of I 9 J 4 &gt; an d to have taken over complete control of the road by May 1915. This again is undue leisureliness. 6^ In spite of a good deal of blowing of trumpets, I think there is no doubt that the Swedes have not made a success of recruiting. Practically nothing was done at first. Thereafter they sent out native recruit- mg parties to Khabis and then to Bam, and finally they enlisted a number of Kerman weavers out of the bazar. { hese have all, as was prophesied to them turned out failures. Since then parties have been drafted in from Yezd and Ispahan with whom the Swedes profess to be pleased, but the type of Gendarme seen anging about the bazar appears to be poor in class and physique A few recruits were lately obtained from Shahr Babak who should be better material. 7. In practice they should have had as far as possible one Swede always on tour recruiting from the tribes on the road, such as the Afshar and Bua- chaqch!. In such a force it is most mnnortant at the beginning that the men should be sought out and engaged by the Europeans themselves, as only in this way a direci bond is formed between tne men and the European, and the men do not look to the Persian officers as their real and only patrons. The Swedes would also have had a chance of recommending themselves and their fo.ce » chiefs like Gun, Al, Khan Afshar, and oli Khan Ahmadi, whose friendships and co-operation m the early stages is extremely desirable and probably even ind s- pensable. They would also nave improved their knowledge of the neoule and the language and customs of the country, and would have gradually freed themselves from the tutelage of their Persian Officers—a highly desirable Nothing has been attemped, so far as I have been able to learn, in the wav of personal recruiting, and the point of mean importance in raising an irreeula’r o«;e, the establishment of a close personal relationship between the European Officers and the rank and file, has been I believe overlooked. ^ It may be noted that by heavy drafts from Yezd and Isfahan the numbers of the Gendarmerie were in May brought up to about 600.3 Training and Discipline. 8. A good frontier or Gendarme Officer is no more made in a day than a good levy man, and the Swedes have had no experience which in the leas nuali fies them for work m Persta. Dnllmg Swedes on a Stockholm parade ground is chiefly calculated to induce fixed ideas of a wrong tyoe- ard Tehran . ditions are so d.fferent from those of the provinces that what is ' lea nt there°is probably harmful rather than useful. Nor again have the Swedes anoarent v had any other experience of a kind which bears any analogy to the work requTred of them in Persia. Ghmstedt was it A true, in West Africa, but that does not seem to help him while de Mare was only an Officer in the Reserve and Oert.ngren, according to their own saying, was a Policeman. They have ihere- fore had no proper Military training even on European lines. This necessarily affects their ideas of training Road-Gendarmes, which do not appear to go much beyond Barrack square drill. Any Persian or any Pathan can learn that, and must learn some, but what is of real importance for the Road- Levy is musketry, cross country work, and cross country discipline This I do not think the Swedes are in the least competent to teach. If tribesmen were enlisted they would have some instinct for these things, but Persian towns men and villagers have none. It must be taught them. A Persian villager perfect in presenting arms and in Swedish exercises would be a babe on the hillside facing a Khaiber Rifleman of a few month’s standing, or even an Afshar tribesman 9. Accordingto their lights the Swedes have taken and are taking much troub,e with the training of the men, but in my opinion it is largely labour wasted and if one may judge from the general bearing and appearance of the men, not very effective of its kind. I am not referring merely to old and dirty uniform and equipments which it may not have been possible to replace. 10. Discipline in the lines I believe to be good, and too high a standard of general discipline must not be expected from a force of Persians raised so hurriedly. Still the conduct of the men is not restrained as it should be. Com plaints of bullying are frequently heard from Persians, and even such grandees as the Sirdar Nusrat have to complain of being galloped past on narrow roads or gallopjted at^and ridden off the road The bearing of a number of the men is that of proprietor or son of a proprietor. About 40 per cent think it worth their while to pay any attention to His Majesty’s Consul when accompanied by his escort in uniform. This is in spite of strong injunctions by Captain de Mare. 11. I have not sought to annoy the Swedes needlessly by commenting on the general behaviour of the Gendarmes ; but I have had to take action in one case in which the office of a British portegti was forcibly entered and his servant carried off to the Gendarme lines by a Persian Officer; in a second case where a British subject’s servant w'as alleged, probably with truth, to have been assaulted ; and in a third where another British portege's servant was arrested and confined in the Gendarme lines. All these acts were prepetrated without the Swedes \ hearing anything about them until I made reference to them. I had also to j complain of a Gendarme stealing Consulate fruit and abusing the Consulate servants In the treatment of these cases I have no serious complaint against the Swedes, though the exclusion of a complainant while his witnesses are giving evidence before a purely Gendarme ‘Court ’ does not accord with our ideas of fairness. But this 1 am assured is Swedish law, and is no doubt superior to British, Indian, or Persian legal custom. It is to be remembered however, that the Consulate is particularly favourably situated, and that private individuals could not expect to receive the consideration which is accorded to it. 12 One circumstance which might be a cause of want of discipline and of arbitrary action by petty Persian officers is the fact that the Swedes all live .on the other side of the town from the Barracks and some two miles from them. They can know nothing of wrhat is going on when they are not there. From the moment they arrived no Swedish Officer has ever lived in the lines.4 There is no question that the Gendarmes should not be in the town at all. Men and Officers should either be at some Headquarters on the road, say Baft, or at least in camp or quarters a mile or two out of the town, which should be out of bounds. Even in India cantonments are almost invariably located at some ^ distance from the native city. iq The actual presence of the Swedes, however, does not guarantee against improper conduct on the part of their men. It appears that they do not know enough of the language or the people really to know what is going on or who is in the wrong. Mr Cane, an ex-Sapper, of the I. E. T. D. recently accompanied* Major Glimstedt to Bandar Abbas and back. He reports (and he is not unfriendly, nor untruthful) that he has never had such an anxious journey during the 20 years he has knocked about in Persia. The party was entirely run by the Persian Officer, so far as it was run by anyone, and everywhere the people were driven to exasperation by the exactions of the Gendarmes which nothing was done to prevent. Apart from illegal exactions, it appearthat the Gendarmes do { not pay cash for supplies requisitioned, but only give orders for deduction from the year’s revenue demand, the exact amount of which is seldom definitely fixed or fully collected and which may not be due for a year. This may not be the Swedes’ fault, but it is a thoroughly vicious system and should be vigo rously protested against by them. On this journey matters reached a crisis when the Gendarmes forcibly seized two donkeys from a camp without payment of price or hire. The people turned out and began throwing down the Gendarmes* loads. They then attacked them with sticks and stones. Glimstedt and Cane then appeared on the scene and were similarly attacked. Glimstedt in a rage at once drew the men up in line and directed them to load their rifles, and was on the point of ordering them to fire on the mixed crowd of men and women when Cane interfered and placed himself, with no little pluck, in front of the firing line. He eventually succeeded in calming down both the people and the Major. 15. The whole affair was the fault of the Gendarmes, and anyone of ordi nary intelligence would quickly have found this out and dealt with the matter accordingly. As it was, five minutes’ more and the small party of Gendarmes numbering some 15 would have been wiped out by the maddened and frightened tribe. Nothing was done towards punishing the Gendarmes responsible for the fracas. Everyone who has travelled in Persia has met with incidents of this sort rwhere hastiness would have led to bloodshed but calm enquiry decided the matter in a few minutes. Then no harm is done, but ill-advised action as in the present case will be remembered against all Europeans for 50 years. 16. The trouble and perturbation caused in Bandar Abbas by these 15 Gendarmes, whom their Swedish Commanding Officer was apparently totally incapable of controlling, has been reported by His Majesty’s Consul at Bandar Abbas in his Diary No. 24 of 1914, paragraph 101. All this is not due to any wilful fault or evil intention on the part of the Swedes, but to a sheer lack of ordinary human intelligence and understanding which they display in one way or i another daily. Even the Swedes’ pet orderlies who constitute their domestic servants, thieve and steal wherever their masters are guests; and even the deceased Dr. Ronne’s belonging^fell a prey to them, to the great indignation of his widow. Nothing is done to stop this or to get rid of the men. Practical Work, jtW* W 1 ; jKStionPi 1 rkkrt 1 ™ njf occuF Sirmeswer us made bp altobebei jic Marin* itadeMa: igilbstto nflltlathisj ate. 18 .

At least .h..ld «, talk about it if they intended to stay on. Actions such as those described variously arouse exasperation and derision both very dangerous sentiments for a struggling institution to have to face., Acquisition of information, attitude towards advice. 21 One very marked feature of the Swede, as he has come under observa tion here, is his inability to get information, and h.s refusal to seek, much less accept advice. In regard to the former, I may refer back to paragraph n and also further cite the case of Murtaza Quli Khan, who was taken on as a Gendarme Officer and nested in Bam. Early injune he got drunk and kdled or nearly killed a per fect^ harmless man. He then fled. Late in July the Swedes learned this for the first time from myself, who had heard it incidentally from 3 distinct sources. It was then discovered that the man was in Kerman, where he was ultimately arrested. a? The Swedes never seek information or advice from the outside nor , European or Persian, but rely, it is said, entirely on their north-country Persian officers who are as ignorant as they of the Province and the people. To proffer advice however tactfully, is the sure way to induce action in a diametrically opposite direction. People who are too proud to acknowledge the claims of supe rior knowledge or experience can, however, often be helped by decantln | ''‘ 0 ™ a n tion to them unostentatiously in the course of general conversation, and are of en ready to accept advice in this form. Not so the Swedes, for they have not the wit to grasp what is said to them unless it is repeated in words of two syllables with blatant emphasis. Someone rashly advised them soon after their arrival 10 discard the small Persian Kullah in favour of sun-hats for work in the open. (Their men it may be remarked wear European helmets.) This settled the question for the Swedes, they would have no sun-hats. I myself in the early days counselled Major Glimstedt to telegraph for double- flv tents for the use of the officers who were then proposing to tour in the low country. As a concession of grace he said he would write for tents, but nothing more has been heard of them. When he came to travel to Bandar Abbas in May he for long absolutely declined to take a proper tent or hat, and was only overcome by Mr. Cane who declined point blank.to accompany him unless he did. tie me borrowed those articles. In view of the Swedes’ habitual attitude to advice, I have seriously contemp lated advising them to add to their slock of wines and liqueurs and to ma champagne their beverage at every meal. But in this case they might p consistent. ^ . 23 . Much insight into men’s characters can be gained by stud y*?g 1 £ £ conceptions of their work and comparing their estimate o em cap X . their actual achievements. Stupid people who do not see the difficulties g commonly over-estimate their powers.t Before they had been many weeks in Kerman it was difficult to get the Swedes to talk of recruiting or of whe Bandar Abbas road, but they would descant at length on schemes for opening up a direct route to Shiraz and for pacifying and garrisoning Baluchistan. They had no mind for the work immediately before them, but would talk of speedily taking over the control of all the forces in the Province. They at once began clumsily intriguing to get control of the Regular Forces, the City Police, and the Qarasuran (Road Guards). In this, they were abetted by Mr. Lecoffre who, as Financial Agent, had ends of his own in view. To some slight extent they have now modified their attitude ; but they still cling to the opening of the Slrjan-Shiraz route and the control of the Police through a special Swedish Officer. 24 . Their conception of the manner in which their work is to be carried^ out is very clear both from their conversation and their actions. An additional Swedish Officer is to be supplied to reside in Bandar Abbas. The rest will live in Kerman. From time to time an officer will go out to inspect the line of posts from one end to the other. Comfortable and abundant accommodation for all the Swedes has been secured in Kerman in the European quarter, and negotiations were on foot to lease still further houses. Permanent lines are to be P^aed for the full strength of the men. When it is represented to them that the bulk ot the force and several Swedish Officers should be permanently on the road, they ignored the latter item, and argue that for several years, during which it is apparently expected that recruiting on a large scale and training will be going on, quarters will be required at Headquarters for the full strength cd the force. I think that the real underlying idea is that of raising^ a force sufficient to meet all the needs of the whole Province, probably including Baluchistan, to be run by Swedes residing in Kerman town. 2 c. But the present day of beginnings is no time for allowing such^ golden schemes to overrule the necessities of the moment or embarrass the financial posi tion bv expenditure not immediately imperative. Rather the training of men in batches should be pushed on and as they reached a sufficient degree of efficiency they should be sent on out^de duty Any spare money might have been spent on building small posts on tne nearer part of the road father than on dining-palaces m Kerman, and these posts c0 “' ‘ « be occupied and experience gained in developing a system of Road Protection and Escorts. The first few stages are safe enough, and there would have been no danger of striking up against superior and hostile force. Very soon it should have been possibleUiTnd^s'trong escorts right through once a month o so wnh caravans to Bandar Abbas, whence incoming caravans co H ld J^n Swedish officer should have been detached to superintend these PO^^r escorts^ The training thus given to the men and officers would have been much more useful than pure drill on a Kerman parade ground.

The Swedes demand cool weather and mountain guns, and maintain that a telegraph line is an absolute necessity ; but what levy on the North West Fron tier enjoys these “ aids ” ? Glimstedt recently turned petulant because the 1. E. T. D. officials would not begin building a telegraph line for him with 4 miles of material which chanced to be lying in Bandar Abbas. The Swedes' Private Conduct and Character, X 7. I have passed under critical review the principal official work and doings of the Swedes in Kerman as far as these are known to me. Most of the matters referred to have been more fully dealt with in my weekly or monthly Diaries. I will now pass to a consideration of the Swedes in their more private capa cities. This may have an appearance of unfairness, but in fact character and conduct and manners are more in any Eastern country, and especially in Persia, than even the gift of tongues (which the Swedes incidentally do not possess) or the military talents of a Gustavus Adolphus. It is through public respect for his morals, and for his essential reasonableness and practical common sense, and through his own singleness and steadfastness of purpose that the European is able to do the work he does in the East. 28. The Swede’s standard of considerateness and common sense, and of self-respect and sobriety are below what is usual among Europeans in Persia. He has a veneer of European manners and verbal courtesies, but he is con- temptous of Persian susceptibilities and courtesies and titles which play such a large part in Persian life. Perhaps he is now improving in this respect, but at first at any rate he suffered from his neglect. Where he can, he continues to be high-handed without judgment. 29. His essential want of that understanding which lies at the base of all real “ manners” has been abundantly revealed in his relations with other Euro peans. Four out of six Swedes (including a valet) have been fed and nursed through enteric by the community without the others making the slightest at tempt to render any practical assistance. The ailing comrade is wholly abandon ed to the good Samaritan who receives no support. Scarce and precious invalid foods have been lavished on the Swedes without a proposal being made by them to replace or even pay for them, though the givers may require them themselves tomorrow and cannot replace them under six months. For weeks Mrs. Dodson cooked Oertingren’s food with her own hands, and others of the Church Missionary Society ladies rendered weeks of unremitting day and night service by the bedsides of Swedes, but no more gratitude has been shown than for the offer of a cigarette. Oertingren on his recovery did not even call on Mrs. Dodson. A partial exception should be made in the case of Major Glimstedt, who has real springs ot gratitude, but wrhose limited imagination has prevented him from showing it by lightening, in the many ways in which he might have, the task and responsibilities of doctors and nurses. 30. The community is an exceptionally kindly one and recognises the Swedes’ limitations and continues to show them all charity ana friendliness, but now without affection or enthusiasm ; and its mind has become entirely critical. This was not so at first and the Swedes have entirely themselves to thank for it. Their feelings and sensibilities are so far removed from those of Englishmen that true sympathy is impossible^ Areally affectionate wife who can casually inspect her husband’s ashes in a tin in the presence of strangers, rush out into the street and take snapshots of his passing bier, and at a still earlier stage busy herself with selling his clothes to the highest bidder among his companions and valet, with gaiety and laughter at misfits, is beyond the comprehension of a mere Briton* It is no doubt all right, but there is a gulf fixed somewhere* Andif tfiere is a gulf between Swede and Briton in sueh thin™., in, infinitely greater one between the Swede and th e h Persif n hk USt ^ ceremony and propriety and decorum.

As far as those in Kerman are concerned Glimstedt and J Ma 6 are I believe the chief or only offenders. 0 n 'Kl^ e road f^orn Teheran, they indulged in occassional orgies, and o possible excuse has since been let slip for renewing them in Kerman. Not contented with getting drunk in the privacy of their own mess, they sometimes make their Persian officers join them, and Sir Coleridge Kennard fo/nd de Mare excess^dy and quarrelsomely drunk, and Glimstedt stupidly drunk when he called at the Russian Consulate. ^ r ^° f nsu ^ ^ ^em to themselves and subsequentlv applied to Mr. Tavlor of the bank tor assistance in removing them from his house. By this time both Swedes were seriously drunk, and de Mare only left after having ragged and danced with the Cossackes. Captain de Mare was incapacitated by drink when he arrived at Khabis to look into the conduct of a Persian Officer, and was a subject of scandal and ridicule to the inhabitants, who asked Miss Bird of the C. M. S. whether all European men behaved so. Captain de Mare also, when at Bandar Abbas got so drunk on the British India ships that he had undemonstratively to withdraw from His Majesty’s Consulate where he was a guest till in two or three days he had sufficiently recovered again. It is unnecessary to multiply instances ot the open indulgence of a vice which produces scandal in all sections of the commumty and must lower the respect which the Gendarmes feel for their officers. After every occasion of rejoining de Mare is laid up with ‘fever’. Ghmstedt is less obtrusive in his excesses. 33\ 1 re gard the indulgence of these habits in a place like Kerman as a very serious offence. What is comparatively harmless in a youngster in a ReM- mental mess in Stockholm is a crime in an officer in a conspicious and respon- sffile position in Persia. In Teheran, European vices, and vice in Europeans, have probably become familiar to the public, but this is not the case here. To flaunt them leads 10 a grave diminution in the respect which is general!) entertained tor all Europeans of the superior classes. o4- Extravagance and large notions of luxury are other characteristics of V 6 we des which are out of place in Gendarme officers, and unfortunate where the money expended really comes, as I take it, out ofthe pockets of British tax- payers. I have mentioned their building experiments and their intention of securing an unnecessary amount of house accommodation because they were dissatisfied with the deficiency in flowers and bulbuls of the gardens of those they already The Gendarme demand for snow (treated by other Europeans as an occasional luxury) and for firewood, is so large that those articles are almost unobtainable by the general public and prices have leapt up. At the same time a scale of drink and food is being set up which, while dis countenanced by persons of character, will undoubtedly not fail to corrupt the morals and empty the purses of the weaker vessels of the community, such as elegraph aud Bank subordinates. How the Gendarmes, whose, pay is not high, ks /are able at one and the same time to lend Government 2 or 3 thousand tumans to pay the Gendarmerie, and to drink champagne and maintain expensive mess, is something of a mystery. Perhaps it is a testimony to the worthy and sober Lychnell’s talents as Finance Officer and Mess Secretary. Such practices are of course not in themselves criminal, but they are highly injurious to a community not very well off nor very strong-minded in all its units. 35. In painting the failings of the Swedes, it would be unfair not to put in some background of virtue. Glimstedt, if petulant, childish and dullwitted is essentially a gentleman, with gentlemanly and friendly instincts. De Mare, if boyish, irresponsible, high-handed, and given to drinking bouts, is full of “ go ” and vigour and with knowledge and taining might make an excellent soldier. Lychnell is, as far as I know, without anything to damn him as a Quarter master. Oertingren probably only lacks intelligence anrl perception and apparently energy as his nickname in the fo r ce is “ Tambal Sahib ” i.e. “ The Slacker ”. But these lights, sparsely appearing amid shades, are not sufficient to qualify the Swedes for the active command of a Persian force in Persia. I should add that I have received nothing but courtesy from the Swedes and that my relations with them have never been anything but friendly This cannot, however, blind me as an official, to their failings as officers of Persian Gendarmerie. 36. Were they not Swedish, but British Officers, I would pass the following judgment on them, and ask for the removal of all of them except perhaps Lychnell. (a) They are not professionally qualified for the work entrusted to them. (£) They have not the character, intelligence, or “ sympathy ” requisite for working with Persians. (r) By their deficiencies, mental and moral, they will bring Europeans into contempt. • # (^) By their lack of capacity to understand what is foreign to them, and unwilligness to listen or learn, they will mishandle all negotiations or political work which may come into their hands, and they will ruin the tribes for future political relations with His Majesty’s Government. (&lt;?) They fail to concentrate on the work immediately in hand and show a marked tendency towards extravagance and a strong desire to lead a comfortable life. . 37 - Again, as Swedes, all the odium which they acquire will fall on the British, either directly as being also Europeans, or indirectly as being their sponsors and the cause of their being here. This relationship bewteen us is well known to all more intelligent Persians. As Swedes, any power or influence wh ch they may ultimately acquire in the province, thanks to “ force majeure ”, will be of no direct use or benefit to the British Government, and it will not even be possible to count on its alwavs being exerted in the favour of British interests. The Swedes’ object is to extend their influence and to become as independent as possible. When they become sufficiently firmly established they will attain their ends unless they are directly paid by the British Government and restrained by it. It will be impossible to count on their taking a sane and reasonable view of any question of policy, even where they have no intention of doing the British a disservice. s h° r t» I consider that the maintenance of a large force under Swedish Officers^ of the type now in Kerman, will immensely complicate and embarrass the political situation for any other Power which in the future may want, or be compelled, to exercise a strong influence or control in southern Persia. Ci 14 FD— 44 *“ 3 io- 14-GCBP Simla.Pol. 2255. Dated 11th June 1914. (Immediate.) India Office, Whitehall, 29th June 1914. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. ^ 11 forwarding for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs enclosed copy 01 a telegram'-' from the Government of India, the Secretary of State for India desires to offer’ the following observations upon the measures recom mended by them for the rehabilitation of British interests in South Persia. 2 . Ihe Marquess of Crewe agrees with the Government of India that these measures, initiated and carried out in the spirit which animates His Majesty’s Government, would not only be fully compatible with, hut would tend actively to promote, the independence and integrity of Persia. But he is constrained to admit that they would not generally be so regarded, while they might easily furnish a pretext to the Russian Government for the initiation of similar measures in a contrary spirit. These considerations must be faced from the outset, but need not be deterrent. 3. It may be more difficult to reconcile the proposed measures with the other obligations of His Majesty’s Government. It is obvious that they could not be undertaken without a previous under standing with Russia, and her probable attitude may be inferred from the reproach made in connexion with the Trans-Persian Railway, that His Majesty’s Government seemed to be seeking a monopoly (of railway construction) in the neutral sphere. Thus the whole question of the Con vention might be raised, and proposals for the enlargement of the British sphere be forced upon us. 4. As regards that contingency, Lord Crewe shares the objections felt by the Government of India to raising the question of abolishing the neutral sphere. Apart from considerations of enlarged responsibilities, increased expense, and possible effect on Moslem sentiment, British com mercial and political interests are so distributed over the neutral sphere as to make relinquish ment of any portion of it to Russia difficult and hazardous. An examination of the map will render discus sion of this point superfluous, but it is clearly not probable that it will be accepted by Russia. The object of His Majesty’s Government should, there fore, be to secure our position in the Gulf and the S. 245.lands bordering on it without raising the question of partition. h. The first step which Lord Crewe would urge is the strengthening of our position in Aiabistan. Whatever may be the case in theory, there can be no doubt that the acquisition by His Majesty’s Government of a predominant share in the Anglo- Persian Oil Company has materially extended our responsibilities in Western Persia, and it is fortunate that this has happened in a region in which our political interests are already deeply involved. The maintenance of the status quo in Arabistan has long been recognised as essential to our position in the Gulf, and recent developments have only emphasised that fact. But the course of events that is likely to ensue upon the death of Sheikh Khazal gives rise to some anxiety, and in this connection 1 am to invite attention to the letter from the Political Resident, Bushire, No. 3713, of 7th December 1913, and other correspondence sent to your department on the Ibth instant, and to the telegram 0 from the Govern ment of India, copy of which is enclosed. The case is stated with such ability and cogency by Sir P. Cox that detailed comment seems un necessary ; it is, however, for consideration whether the opportunity should not be used to obtain from the Sheikh of Mohammera an undertaking similar to that given by the Sheikh of Xoweit in the Agreement of 23rd January 1899, binding him self, his heirs and successors not to cede, sell, lease, mortgage, or give for occupation or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory to any foreign Power, or the subjects of any foreign Power, without the previous consent of His Majesty’s Government, Lord Crewe would propose, with Sir E. Grey’s concurrence, to instruct the Government of India to endeavour, if they see no objection, to obtain such an undertaking; but m any e\ent, to give to the Sheikh, on the occasion of his investiture with the Iv.C.S.L, the enlarged assurance forming enclosure 2 in Captain Bird wood’s letter, No. 467, of 14th February last. 6. His Lordship would also recommend that, as proposed by the Government of India, action should be taken in the sense of paragraph 17 (6\ (c), and (d) of Sir P. Cox’s letter, and at an early date. J 7. Returning now to the Government of India’s telegram of the 11th instant, Lord Crewe is of opinion that if the Sheikh of Mohammera is thus fortified, if a clear and friendly understanding exists with the .Bakhtians, and if at the same time the railway is pressed on to Dizful with the least possible delay— a measure to which he attaches very great importance the effect is likely eventually to be left m Luristan. But in the meantime the Anglo- Persian Company should be in a position toMBB9 tlelend itself against tribal attacks, and Loul Crewe ■\\oii ( ^ suggest that it should be required to maintain, at its own expense, a corps of local levies. \ 11 1 le subsidy recently renewed to the Tigris ana Euphrates Navigation Company should suffice to secure that Company against Messrs. Wonckhaus’ encroachments on the Karim for the next two years, during which it is hoped that the new (In ectorate may see fit to adopt more active and business-like methods for the furtherance of its business ; and Lord Crewe is of opinion that the measures above indicated, taken together, will sufficiently safeguard the position of Great Britain in this most important region. 9. In southern Persia His Lordship attaches primary importance to securing a lease of the islands at the mouth of the Gulf, and to pressing forward with as little delay as possible negotiations with Russia that will permit of the construction of a i ail way inland from Bunder Abbas. But as regards the latter he is unable to recommend that any further concessions should be made in respect of an alignment east of that place, or of British predominance on the southern section and in the port itself; and he would ask whether it is impossibly, irrespective of these negotiations, to arrange with the Persian Government for the commencement of the southern survey. Such a measure, which would seem to be justified by the fact that the Persian Railways Syndicate have a claim on His Majesty’s Government prior to that of the Societe, in respect of a line from Bunder Abbas to Kerman, might serve to bring the Russian Government to a more speedy decision. If the survey is undertaken Lord Crewe would urge that it should be under the protection of a British escort. Its operations will be in districts that have not yet been policed by the Swedish gendarmerie, which is notoriously undermanned. 10. The question of this gendarmerie is one of great difficulty. Lord Crewe has hitherto supported the Swedish officers, not because he felt great confidence in their eventual success, but because he realised the grave political objections to the substitution of British officers. The course of events has neither increased his confidence nor diminished the objections; but without endorsing Sir W. Townley’s opinion as to the success that has actually been achieved, so far as the south is concerned, he is impressed by the con siderations advanced in the Minister’s telegram No. 181, of the 19th instant, and recognises that the coronation of the young Shah is the worst possible moment for a change of policy that could hardly fail to throw the new Government into opposition to British interests. Such a step too, would, he thinks, be likely to endanger the success of the programme outlined above, which pre-4 supposes a certain amount of good will on the part of the Persian Government. If therefore, Sir E. Grey approves this programme, and there is a reasonable probability of carrying it out, Lord Crewe is of opinion that His Majesty’s Government could afford to tolerate the Swedish regime in Ears and Kerman for another year at all events, and to continue to advance funds for the purpose. But he considers it essential (1) that the advances should be administered under the supervision of His Majesty’s Minister, and should not be used out side Ears and Kerman ; (2) that the Swedish Government should be pressed not to agree to any modification of the contracts with the new officers in the directions indicated in Sir W. Townley’s telegram of 18th Ala}-, and to see that only first-class officers are sent; (3), that the Persian Government should be urged to instruct the Swedish officers that their first duty is to maintain order on the roads to the coast, and that it should be impressed both on that Government and on the Swedish Government, that inasmuch as the gendarmerie owes its continued existence solely to British money and support, British interests and commerce have a claim upon its services, second only to its obligation of loyalty to Persia; (4) that orders for supplies in Ears and Kerman should be placed with British and Indian firms. The last is, perhaps, a small matter in itself, but it appears to his Lordship to be one in which His Majesty’s Minister should feel bound to exercise a special degree of watchfulness in behalf of British and Indian commerce. In return for this concilia tory attitude (the continuance of which, however, should be understood to be conditional upon a marked improvement in the efficiency of the force), His Majesty’s Government would expect amenability on the part of the Persian Government in respect of the lease of the islands and other matters men tioned above. 1L Lord Crewe puts forward these suggestions v.dth a sincere desire to avoid a radical departure from the traditional policy of His Majesty’s Govern ment in Persia. But he realises that, even if they are successfully carried out, they are the minimum that is required for the maintenance of British interests, and that they must be supplemented by a firmer resistance of all attempts to push Russian influence south of Ispahan than the terms of the iVnglo-Russian Convention may, perhaps, be held to justify. If they prove impracticable, he sees no alternative to a revision of that instrument, with all the disagreeable contingencies that may ensue.

Sir I have the honour to refer to a communication addressed- to you by the Bank on 24th September, with reference to the possibility of there being a deficiency in the amount due by the Persian Government for the serv ice of the Imperial Persian Loan of 1911, the next coupon of which is due on the 15th proximo and -requires a total of &lt;£31,250:0:0 to meet it. Up to date, we have received from our Chief Office in Teheran a total of &lt;£15,623:6:7 made up as follows:- The short payment for the month ended 8th September was £3,865:18:4 Period, 16th May to 8th June £3864:4:11 8th June to 8th July 8th July to 8th August 8th August to 8th September 5208:6:8 \ 5208:6:8 1342:8:4 £1 5.623:6:7 The Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.\n&lt;4 •' r\ oZS, 865:18:4 and in the ordinary course vje would have received for the month 8th September to 8th October 5,208 :6:8 for the month 8th October to 8th Nov. 5,208 :6:8 and for the period 8th Nov. to 15th Nov. 1.344 :1:9 Totalling &lt;£1 5.626:13:5 which, if received, would make the amount required for payment of the coupon. But owing to the stoppage of trade in the southern, ports, consequent on the y ' r ar, the Persian Crovemment have declared, their inability to provide the deficiency and, unless m.eans can be found to arrange this, the payment of the coupon vnll have to be passed, thereby most seriously damaging the credit of the Persian Government, which is low enough already in the eyes of the British 'Bihlic; hut it will also seriously affect, particularly in Persia, the prestige of the British Government whose political interests in Southern Persia are of such importance, especially at the cjf_, present time. The passing of the coupon is also bound to have a very damaging effect on the influence and credit of this Banff in Persia, not only from the fact of our being the issuing House, but more so, because our interests are bound up with those of the British Government m maintaining British prestige in Persia against the various Governments and Poioers who are so keenly desir ous to see it diminished,. a The amount required is not/large one and there is of course the probability that it may be reduced by further payments before the 15th proximo, though it would be unsafe to rely on this. The interest on the Indian Government Loan of£290,000 has hem regularly paid up to the 8th September and we assume that as it is a first charge on the Southern customs, even the reduced receipts may enable these payments to he regularly continued* The interest on the Anglo-Indian advances of £496,000 has been paid up to 8th August hut as these rank after the Persian Government Loan of 1911, payments ifiusit naturally cease until the Revenue recovers* In view of the foregoing, we would take the liberty °J suggesting for your consideration the question of the British and/or the Indian Government advancing to the /Persian Government the amount required, with a clear stipulation that it be earmarked for the service of the Indian Government loan and of the D ersian loan of 1911. We would point out that the amounts which have been paid since the 15th May last to the British and the Indian Governments in respect of these outstanding loans to the p ersian Government are as follows: Indian Government Loan Pa i cl Ind i a Offi ce 23rd May £1, 873:14:10 23rd June 1, 9^3:14:10 28th July 1,973:14:10 12th September 1,973:14:10 29th September 1,973:14:10 £9,868:14:2 Anglo-Indian Advan ces * Paid to India 0ffice23rd May £2,200:0:0 23rd June 2,200:0:0 28th July 2,200:0:0 12th September 2.200:0:0 £8.800:0:0 £18.668:14:2 and, as an alternative to the above proposal, we suggest that the British and Indian Governments remit so much of the above XKXMXMXX payments on account of Interest asmay r'&amp;yU'ired to make up the deficiency on the Interest payable by the D ersian Government in respect of the Public Loan of 1911, on the understanding that the am ounts so remitted shall he repaid at the earliest opp ortunity out of the Southern customs. Tr/ &lt;s would beg to point out that the Bondholders of the Public Loan of 1911 would appear to be entitled, to claim remission of the Interest paid in respect of the Anglo-Indian advances inasmuch as the former takes precedence over the latter. Therefore the above alternative proposal only involves the remission of a portion of the payments which have been made since 15th May 1914, in respect of the Indian Government Loan.

After conversation with Minister for Foreign Affairs on Wednesday I requested to see Ain-ed-Dowleh and the President of the Council together yesterday. We had conversation of over two hours, at which Minister of Finance was present. I represented that, unless money was at once forthcoming and reliable assurances given for the future regular payment of gendarmerie, Swedish officers had decided at once to present their resignations. I made a communication in the sense of your above- mentioned telegram, and pointed out that, instead of answering my memorandum embodying the proposals of His Majesty’s Government for the purchase of certain islands in Persian Gulf, Minister for Foreign Affairs had addressed me officially, asking that all payments on southern customs should be suspended for one year and a joint advance of 3,000,000 tomans (about 500,000L) should be made to Persia by Great Britain and Russia. A pious hope that things may mend is the only security offered for the future repayment of advance and for resumption of payments due from the southern customs^d ^ -j- refuged t0 gubmit a proposal unless I received some satisfactory assurance that sale of islands would be carried through. ^ President of the Council put in a sentimental pleading on the grounds that Great Britain has always helped Persia, who has nobody but her to rely on. I refused to listen to such arguments. President of Council then said that question of sale of the islands could not be treated until the Medjliss assembled in a few days, and after much discussion a g r ee that he would to-morrow lay the question before the Cabinet and let me know it the Ministers would undertake to press its conclusion upon the Medjbss as soon as it meets. I answered that until I received his reply I would not submit quite unacceptable request for a further advance to your consideration. Representative of the Swedes called on me this morning. ^ . On my telling him that I saw no prospect of money being forthcoming, he said that he and his comrades would send in their resignations, and t at or ers won e issued for the withdrawal of the men on the roads to their centres m order that their arms may be collected.

Position of gendarmerie becoming most serious, about 20,000L [group undecypherable] owing to them. Large reductions are being made, and men are being disbanded on all sides. Swedish officers are naturally reluctant to remain whilst force under then* command visibly deteriorates owing to want of funds. The men are in rags, and it is piteous to compare their appearance to-day with the good show they made six months ago. The Swedes complain, and with reason, that there is apparently always money for local forces that exist on paper only, but none for gendarmerie. I have made strong representations on this head in cases of Kerman and Pars, but I have not so far succeeded in persuading the Government of their folly in paying for perfectly useless forces. _ At Kerman, where Governor has his own force, there is no need for a local army, which as a matter of fact is non-existing, though regularly paid for. At Shiraz there is more force in argument that Governor-General’s prestfoe requires a force outside the gendarmerie and that we have recognised this. To this I answered that we granted value of a disciplined force under a European officer, but not of the existing rabble. I have threatened to devote what remains of the 50,000L advanced to pay gendarmerie debts to British firms unless means are found to provide money for gendarmerie. Another serious feature is the early departure of senior Swedish officers, who have finished their contract. Two are leaving Shiraz, and a very young and inexperienced officer will be left in charge unless a senior officer can be sent from Sweden. It is most unfortunate that situation should appear so hopeless when a detachment has just been established at Ispahan. Safety of road to Bushire has thereby been greatly increased, and a combined attack to put an end to Naib Hussein, the scourge of Kashan, is in course of preparation. The Swedes themselves think that presence of General Hjalmarson might save the situation.jTliis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and * should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with unless rsnuired for official use.] fc-i copy.

No doubt his full salary until the conclusion of his contract will be claimed if he does not return. The link on the southern trade route between Ears frontier and Kasalle territory is about to be made good, and in my opinion it would be a thousand pities if force were to be allowed to disappear. The Government are quite alive to the necessity of maintaining it, and will find money for it rather than for anything else. Despite many mistakes made, the force has made its influence seriously felt for good and has surmounted many serious obstacles.

Townley to Sir Edicai'd Grey.—(Received September 8.) Sir, Tehran, August 1, 1914. WITH reference to your telegram No. 156 of the 16th ultimo upon the subject of Major O’Connor’s statement that the Treasurer-General had not properly allocated to the Administration of Ears the entire sum of 30,0001. earmarked for the purpose out of the last British advance of 200,000Z., I have the honour to transmit copies of despatches which were addressed to me by Major O’Connor during his recent visit to Tehran, giving details of an arrangement reached between him and the Treasurer- General respecting the financial administration of Ears. It will be seen that under this arrangement the practice hitherto observed of transmitting all the revenues of the province to Tehran will be discontinued. It will appear from the figures given that the provincial administration of Ears did indeed benefit to the extent of about 18,500Z. from the 30,000Z. earmarked for the purpose out of the 1913 advance of 200,000L, but that the remaining 11,500Z. destined for the special service was not applied thereto. When questioned last August (a year ago) upon the subject, M. Mornard assured me that the entire sum had been remitted to Ears, and I can only believe his word that such was the case, although it is clear that, if this was done, a large portion of it came back to the Central Treasury in the form of revenue, so that the actual figures for the year remain as stated above. I am myself not quite clear whether or not it wms the intention of His Majesty’s Government that the entire sum of money should have been actually expended in Ears over and above the revenues of the province, or whether they would not have been satisfied with the knowledge that the local stringency was so greatly relieved at the commencement of the last financial year by the use of the 30,000L that no real harm was done by the surplus that was not required for the civil administration being devoted to other purposes. For instance, the sum of ]00,000L advanced by His Majesty’s Government for the upkeep of the gendarmerie in Ears did not suffice for that purpose, and a considerable additional sum of money had to be provided out of the funds at the disposal of the Central Treasury. From the perusal of the correspondence on the subject of the fresh advance of 50,000L made by His Majesty’s Government for the use of the gendarmerie in Ears and Kerman, it would be seen that there is no danger of any portion of that money being diverted to any other purpose than that for which it was lent. It has appeared to me that 40,0001. of the above-named sum may fairly be allotted to Ears and 10,000/. to Kerman, where the force is very much smaller and the financial situation more encouraging. Major O’Connor is of opinion that 40,000/. added to the revenues of the province should enable the expenses of the gendarmerie to be met until the end^ of the current Persian financial year, which terminates on the 20th March next. Special caie will be taken to see that the money lent by His Majesty’s Government for the upkeep of the gendarmerie will be devoted solely to that purpose, as will be duly shown in the accounts to be presented. Having a controlling influence upon the expendituie of this money, Major O’Connor will be in a position to ensure that gendarmeiie orders for supplies are made in India and the United Kingdom. As long as the present state of war exists in Europe it will be impossible to procure supplies from any other source. A perusal of Major O’Connor’s despatches will, I think, show that the arrangement made is the best possible under the peculiar conditions prevailing in Persia at the present moment. It may be argued that it makes for financial decentral mar ion. ns appears to me to be a small drawback compared with the importance to British interests in the province that the financial administration should be conducted m such a mannei that the provincial revenues will be always available for the wants of the piovmcia administration.

WALTER TOWNLEY. * IM Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Major O'Connor to Sir W. Townleij. \No. 1 c.) Sir, Tehran, July 4, 1914. I HAVE the honour to inform you that, in accordance with permission received from you, I had a long conversation yesterday with M. Mornard on the subject of the financial administration of the province of Ears. As your Excellency is aware, the present system under which the revenues of the province are remitted by the Imperial Bank automatically to Tehran on receipt has not proved very satisfactory from the point of view of the efficiency of the provincial administration. The Controller of Finances in Ears is obliged to deposit all the money he collects in the bank, and these deposits are at once remitted to Tehran ; and he has no authority to incur any expenditure, even under the provisions of the sanctioned budget, but is dependent upon the precarious and uncertain supplies which he may receive from time to time from the Treasurer-General. This system may no doubt suit the convenience and the necessities of the Central Government, but from the point of view of the provincial administration it has proved itself highly unsatisfactory. I began the conversation by laying before M. Mornard the figures which I had already submitted to your Excellency, showing that, according to the books of the Imperial Bank, the Treasurer-General had remitted to Ears during the year 1913-14 a sum of 102,000 taels (or about 18,500Z.) in excess of what he had received from the province ; and that he therefore still owes to Ears 11,500Z. out of the 30,0001 especially earmarked for the province out of the 200,000Z. loan of last year ; and I also reminded him that he had borrowed from the Imperial Bank the sum of 116,442 tomans (about 20,000Z.) on the security of the Ears revenues; and that the Central Treasury had therefore benefited from the province of Ears to the extent of some 31,000L during the course of the last year or so. (The real figure is considerably greater than this, but I confined myself to extracts from the bank’s books as supplied to me by the chief manager, which can of course be verified). M. Mornard admitted the correctness of these figures, and was indeed, I think, relieved to find that I had understood the case ; and he is no doubt under the impression that I am unacquainted wdth the other transactions whereby he has extracted revenue for the use of Central Treasury from the money lent by His Majesty's Government for the assistance of the administration and the gendarmerie of the province of Ears. I then said that in view of the circumstances as indicated by these figures, and of the fact that a fresh loan of 50,000L was projected by His Majesty’s Government, a part of which at any rate was intended for the gemdarmerie of E&amp;rs, it seemed desirable that some more satisfactory method should be devised for regulating the finances of Ears so as to ensure that the money actually collected, or lent by His Majesty’s Government for expenditure in the province, should really be expended for the benefit of the provincial administration ; and that it had occurred to me that the best w-ay of securing this result would be by leaving the provincial revenues in the Shiraz branch of the Imperial Bank, in the name of the controller of finance at that place, to be expended there by him under the provisions of the budget sanctioned by the Central Government, this simple expedient will do away with the confusion and uncertainty' which exist under the present system, and would enable the controller to adjust his receipts and expenditure, and to derive the fullest benefit from the revenues of the province. After the discussion of some technical points, M. Mornard agreed that this system might with advantage be adopted, provided that the Imperial Bank had no objection ; but he hinted that the proposed arrangement would make Ears semi-independent as regards its financial administration, and would have the effect of diminishing the interest of the Central Government and of the Treasurer-General in the welfare of the province. I replied that, as far as I could see, no such result need follow. The Central3 Government and the Treasurer-General would still retain the fullest control over the finances of the province. No expenditure could be incurred except such as had previously been sanctioned by the Central Government under the provisions of the provincial budget estimates ; and the accounts of the expenditure would of course be nubmitted monthly to the Treasurer-General, and any irregularities could at once be detected and checked. A.11 that was pioposed m essence was that the actual money collected by the conti ollei should lemam m the province instead of being remitted to Tehran. Finally M. Mornard agreed to my proposal (which I informed him met with the approval of your Excellency), and he expressed a wish to discuss with me the Ears budget estimates in detail next feunday. During the course of that discussion I hope to be able so to adjust the expenditure of the province (a question which I have already thoroughly thrashed opt with M. Stas), including the cost of the gendarmerie, as to bring these expenses within the limits of the provincial revenues—reinforced during the current year by, at any rate, a portion of the new loan projected by His Majesty’s Government. Experience will show whether or no the provincial revenues will alone be sufficient to meet the entire cost of the administration including the gendarmerie, and it is not imposible that a small additional subvention may be required during the first two or three years — especially in view of the losses caused by the plague of locusts from which Ears is now suffering. But at least the new arrangement should enable the Controller of Finances and the British consul between them to evolve some kind of order out of the present chaos ; and it will, moreover, have the advantage of giving all the officials (including the Swedish officers), who are in any way concerned in the administration of the province, a personal interest in the success of the administration as a whole, and will encourage them to work for the increase of the revenue on the one hand, and its economical expenditure to the best advantage on the other. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the political resident in the Persian Gulf for information. I have, &amp;c. AV. F. O’CONNOR. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. caG Major O'Connor to Sir W. Townley. (No. 3 c.) Sir, Tehran, July 7, 1914. IN continuation of my despatch No. I C. dated the 4th July, I have the honour to inform you that I had a further conversation with M. Mornard yesterday morning during which we discussed the various headings of the Ears budget estimates, and that M. Mornard has approved an arrangement under which, it may be hoped, the expenses of the provincial administration may, in future, be limited to a sum which will lie within the estimated provincial revenues—reinforced during the current year by a loan from Elis Majesty’s Government for the use of the gendarmerie. In my telegram to your Excellency, No. 190 of the 22nd May, I had already indicated roughly the nature of the proposals prepared by M. Stas and myself to secure this object. Since the despatch of that telegram, however, circumstances have changed considerably in Ears. We have seen that the arrangement under which Colonel Merrill was sent to Shiraz to reorganise the local troops, and under which he was only an instructor without real powers of command, cannot be worked successfully , and as I have already reported, the whole scheme has broken down and the so-called army has relapsed into its former condition of inefficiency. In view of this fact, and also of the consideration that the provincial revenues would be insufficient (even with the help of a 40,000L advance) to meet the cost of the gendarmes when brought to their full strength under the sanctioned programme, plus a local military force and the other expenses of the provincial administration, it seemed best (and in this view M. Mornard heartily concurred) that the local force should be abolished altogether (except a small bodyguard of about 100 men for the Governor-General), and that t le allotment so saved should be transferred to the gendarmerie (including the roadguaic on the main road), so as to bring their monthly grant up to a total of 40,000 tomans - which sum will probably suffice to meet all their expenses, at any rate until the end of the current year. Ocher details also were discussed, and finally the main budget headings were fixed by M. Mornard as follows (in round figures):4 Governor-General and Staff Gendarmerie and road guards District road guards Governor-General s bodyguard Police ..

(Budget approved by Treasurer-General.) In continuation of my despatch No. i-C., dated 4th July, I have the honour to inform you that I had a further conversation with M. Mornard* yesterday morning during which w T e discussed the various headings of the Pars budget esti mates, and that M. Mornard has approved an arrangement under w r hich, it may be hoped, the expenses of the provincial administration may, in future, be limited to a sum which will lie within the estimated provincial revenues—reinforced during the current year by a loan from His Majesty’s Government for the use of the gendarmerie. In my telegram to Your Excellency, No. 19 ° °f 22nd May, I had already indicated roughly the nature of the proposals prepared by M. Stas and myself to secure this object. Since the despatch of that telegram, however, circumstances have changed considerably in Pars. We have seen that the arrangement under ^ which Colonel Merrill was sent to Shiraz to reeogwse the local troops, and under t w'hich he was only an instructor without real powers of command, cannot be worked successfully; and as I have already reported, the whole scheme has broken down, and the so-called army has relapsed into its former condition of inefficiency. In view of this fact, and also of the consideration that the provin cial revenues would be insufficient (even w r ith the help of a ^40,000 advance) to meet the cost of the gendarmes w r hen brought to their full strength under the sanctioned programme, plus a local military force and the other expenses o t e provincial administration, it seemed best land in this view' M. Mornard hearti y concurred) that the local force should be abolished altogether (except a smad body-guard of about 100 men for the Governor-Generai), and that the allotment so saved should be transferred to the gendarmerie (including the road guards on the main road), so as to bring their monthly grant up to a total of 40,000 tomans— which sum will probably suffice to meet all their expenses, at any rate until the2 end of the current year. Other details also were discussed, and finally the main budget headings were fixed by M. Mornard as follows (in round figures) :— Governor-General and staff ... ... ... 3,000 tomans a month. Gendarmerie and road guards •«. ••• 40,000 » II District road guards ... 3,000 n II Governor-General’s body-guard • •• 1,200 n It Police t • • ••• t • * • •• 2,300 » II Repairs to Government buildings 500 » II Pensions ... ... ... 6,500 ft it Finance Department Administration ... • •• 10,000 &gt;1 ll Monthly total ... 66,500 tomans.

Total ... 820,000 II Deduct for probable losses caused by locusts ... 100,000 l» Net estimated revenue 720,000 „ There should thus, if these figures work out approximately correct in prac tice, be a balance of some 138,000 tomans (say £ 25,000) remaining at the end of the current year to carry on the administration during the early months of next year. Whether a further subvention will be required or not next year de pends upgn factors which cannot at present be forecasted with any certainty. During the course of our conversation I discussed with M. Mornard the im portant question of the appointment of District Governors. This is a much vexed question which has already been the cause of a good deal of difficulty in Fars. Under the new regime the Agents of the Finance Administration are expected to perform several of the most important functions of the old District Governors (notably the collection of revenue), with the inevitable result that the two autho rities^ must often clash. Moreover, a double expense is involved in the way of salaries to a double set of officials, with a double set of staffs, guards, etc. The Mukhbir-es-Saltaneh in this, as in most questions which concern the Finance Department, has adopted an obstructive attitude, and has from the very first endeavoured to embarrass and hamper the Finance Agents in the execution of their duties by open opposition and by subterranean intrigues, conducted general ly through the medium of his nominees, the District Governors. The dual sys tem involves, in fact, a quite unnecessary expense, and is prejudicial to real pro gress and efficiency. M. Mornard, to whom I expressed this view, was in most cordial agreement. He quoted various instances of similar friction between his Agents and local Governors elsewhere, and he informed me that the Cabinet as a whole shared his opinions on the subject. It is proposed, therefore, that in future the duties of istnct Governors and of Finance Agents should be united in the person of a single official (assisted by a suitable subordinate), to be selected by the Gover- Provinc . ial Comptroller of Finance in consultation ; who if hey diner will refer the appointment for decision to Tehran. It will probably take pome little time before this new arrangement can be worked with entire success in bars, where special difficulties exist in certain districts which require special3 treatment; and also because of the lack of suitable personnel the principle now accepted is a sound one, and will work for * ciency. But at any rate economy and effi- This particular question however, is one regarding which theMukhbir-es- Saltaneh has always shown himself particularly troublesome and exacting, and it will, I fear, be difficult to bring the new system into proper working order as long as he remains at Shiraz. I discussed a number of other minor points with M. Mornard regarding which I need not trouble Your Excellency, but regarding which it was useful to know his opinions and to let him understand the local point of view.

Sir:- I liave the honour to refer to a communication addressed to you toy the Bank on 24th September, with reference to the possibility of there being a deficiency in the amount due by the Persian Government for the service of the Imperial Persian Loan of 1911, the next coupon of which is due on the 15th proximo and requires a total of £31,250.0.0. to meet it. Up to date, we have received from our Chief Office in Teheran a total of £15,623.6.7. made up as follows:- Period, 16th May to 8th June £3,864.4.11. 8th June to 8th July 5,208.6. 8. 8th July to 8th August 5,208.6. 8. 8th August to 8th September 1.342.8. 4_. £15,623.6. 7.

Totalling which, if received, would make the amount required for payment of the coupon. But owing to the stoppage of provide the deficiency and unless means can be found to arrange this, the payment of the coupon will have to be passed, thereby most seriously damaging the credit of the Persian Government, which is low enough already in the eyes of the British Public; but it will also seriously affect, particularly in Persia, the prestige of the British Government whose political interests in Southern Persia are of such importance, especially at the present critical time. The passing of the coupon is also bound to have a Persian Government have declared their inability to veryV i v i very dPiuRgiiig sffscti on ‘tho iniluonco 8,nd. cr6(ii*t o± this Bank in Persia., not only irom the font of our Being i the issuing House, hut more so, Because our interests are Bound up with those of the British Government in maintaining British prestige in Persia against the various Governments and Powers who are so keenly desir ous to see it diminished. me amount required is not a large one and there is v of course the probability that it may Be reduced By further payments Before the 15th proximo, though it would Be unsafe to rely on this. The interest on the Indian Government Loan of £290,000 has Been regularly paid up to 8th September and we assume that as it is a first charge on the Southern customs, even the reduced receipts may enable these payments to be regularly continued. The interest on the Anglo-Indian advances of £490,000 has Been paid up to 8th August But as these rank after the Persian Government Loan of 1911, pay ments must naturally cease until the Revenue recovers. In view of the forgoing, we would take theliberty of suggesting for your consideration the ques tion of the British and/or the Indian Government advanc ing to tne Persian Government the amount required, with a clear stipulation that it be earmarked for the service of the Indian Government loan and of the Persian loan of 1911. We would point out that the amounts which have been paid since the 15th hay last to the British and the Indian Governments in respect of these outstanding loans to the Persian Government are as follows:- Indian Government Loan. hnrlQ-Inaian Advances . May £1,973.14.10. - June 1,973.14.10. - July 1,973.14.10. ' September 1,973.14.10. - September 1.973.14.10. / £9,868. 14. May £2,200. 0. 0. • June 2,200. 0. 0.- July 2,200. 0. 0. September 2.200. 0. 0. - £8.800. 0. Q,_ £18,668.14. 2. and, as an alternative to the above proposal, we suggest, that the British and Indian Governments remit so much of the above payments on account of Interest as may be required to make up the deficiency on the Interest pay-payable by the Persian Government in respect of the Public Loan of 1911, on the understanding that the amounts so remitted shall be repaid at the earliest opportunity out of the Southern Customs. We would beg to point out that the Bondholders of the Public Loan of 1911 would appear to be entitled to claim remission of the Interest paid in respect of the Anglo-Indian advances inasmuch as the former takes precedence of the latter. Therefore the above alterna tive proposal only involves the remission of a portion of the payments which have been made since 15th May, 1914, in respect of the Indian Government Loan. i M I have, &amp;c., (Signed) T.

An alternative form of purchase would be as follows :— (1) England and India to pay down, between them, 300,000?. (2) Persia’s debts to India and England, amounting to about 790,000?., to be cancelled. (3) England and India to pay Persia an annuity of x pounds sterling for 99 years, the first payment to take place 12 months after the payment of the 300,000?. (4) In view of the fact that about 296,500?. of the outstanding loans to Persia has been advanced by the Government of India alone, it would be necessary to make a special adjustment with the Foreign Office to equalise matters. This could be done either by the Foreign Office paying practically the whole of the lump sum payment of 300,000?., or by the Foreign Office bearing a larger share than India of the annuity.2 f The annuity to be entered in (3) would depend on whether the purchase basis is 2,000,000h gross or something less. If it were 2,000,000L gross the net sum left after deduction of (1) and (2) would be 910,000L This would represent an annuity for a term of 99 years of 37,150L, on a 4 per cent, basis. If the gross sum were less—for instance, 1,836,390L—the annuity, on the same interest basis, would be approximately 30,480/. If it were 1,500,000/. the annuity would be approximately 16,740/. Scheme II.—Various forms of lease. 1. The Government of India are prepared to share in a lease for 99 years at an annual rental of 100,000/., cost to be equally divided between India Office and Treasury. Three years’ rent (300,000/.), would be advanced in equal shares by the Indian and Imperial Governments. The Government of India do not combine with this proposal any suggestion for the extinction of Persia’s existing debts to the Indian and Imperial Governments. But a calculation has since been made that if Persia’s existing debts were cancelled and an advance of 300,000/. made, a reduction of the rental from 100,000/. to about 55,450/. a year could be claimed in return for these concessions. Of this the Treasury would pay about 30,500/. and the India Office about 24,500/. But the Treasury might pay in some other way their share of India’s separate loan (296,478/.), which figures in the debts to be extinguished. 2. If a rental of 100,000/. is thought excessive, the Persian Government might be prepared to accept 50,000/. a year for a 99 years’ lease on condition of receiving an advance of six years’ rent (300,000/.). It would hardly be practicable to combine this with any proposal for the extinction of Persia’s debts, as the rental left to be paid after such concessions would be onfy about 5,475/. a year. If this offer is thought too low, 75,000/. a year might be offered for a 99 years’ lease, with advance of four years’ rent (300,000/.). The offer in a modified form might include the extinction of existing debt and an advance of 300,000/. A calculation has been made that in that case a rental of about 34,470/. would remain payable. The Treasury might adjust their share of Imlja s separate loan (296,478/.) either (a) by finding practically the whole advance of 300,000/., advance = 150,000/. the remaining rental of 30,000/. by bearing a larger share than India of r...CONFIDENTIAL.

Aide-memoire received from Russian Government states that decrease in revenue from northern customs of Persia was largely due to disorganisation of Russian railway service, and this revenue will now probably show an increase. Minister for Foreign Affairs agrees that any large advance to Persia in present prices is out of the question, but Russian Government is ready to advance 300,000 tomans as soon as conditions laid down by Russian Bank have been accepted by Persian Government. Russian Government has already directed that land tax collected by Russian consulates from Russian subjects be paid over to Persian Government after deducting cost of collection and of maintaining Cossack brigade in Azerbaijan. Russian Government have already consented to cessation of collection of this tax by consuls as soon as Persian Government agrees to lodgment from Russian sphere in Russian Bank. It would therefore be desirable that Imperial Bank of Persia renounce claim to part of these revenues being lodged with them, which is contrary to spirit of agreement of 1907. This would facilitate proposed Russian advance to Persia.confidential. t , o f~l 1 Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 2, 5*45 p.m.) n Tehran, October 2, 1914. (No. 291.) Pl [ J (October 2, 10'30 a.m.) SIR G. BUCHANAN’S telegram No. ^448 of 24tli September. None of the maliat of Azerbaijan has been paid into the Imperial Bank of Persia since Shnster left, and only a small portion of that of Resht. I understand that the Persian Government have proposed scheme in connection with a plan for abolition of the collection of taxes by the Russian consuls, under which half of the maliat of Tabriz and certain other towns of the north would be paid through the Russian Bank and half through other banks which are not specified. As the Russian Minister jumped to the conclusion that the Imperial Bank of Persia was meant, it is probably to this last the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs referred. Prime Minister is most anxious not to give an undertaking that all the maliat in the Russian zone shall be paid through the Russian Bank because he does not wish to accentuate line of zone of demarcation. In my opinion, to accept such an arrangement would be a distinct infringement of the right of the Imperial Bank of Persia, but, as it is most desirable in the interests of all parties that a friendly arrangement should be reached, it would appear to me reasonable that the maliat of the five northern provinces, where Russian influence is paramount, be paid through the Russian Bank and that of the remainder of the provinces in Russian zone, where British interests are considerable, through the two banks equally. The 100,000L loan secured on northern revenues made to Persian Government by the Imperial Bank of Persia in 1913 would, of course, have to be paid off before any such agreement could come into force. A scheme has been proposed under which Russian Bank would advance 1,000,000 tomans to pay off this^ loan, leaving 400,000 tomans in the hands of the Persian Government, and Russian Minister tells me he has asked Russian consuls to supply figures of the maliat collected, and asserts that he is ready to hand over money to the Persian Government at once. He says that if an agreement is made respecting the maliat he will at once instruct Russian consuls to cease its collection, and all that will be required will be that the financial agents shall keep Russian consuls informed of the deposit of the maliat due from each Russian subject. He says that undertaking would be given that all money would be paid in to the Persian Government and none deducted by bank to meet its own claims against the Government and private individuals, as was done in the past. I have spoken in the sense of third paragraph to my Russian colleague and to Persian Government. (Repeated to Petrograd.)CONFIDENTIAL. Sir G.

(September 25, 9*30 p.m.) I COMMUNICATED to Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday the contents of your telegram No. 231 of 22nd September. His Highness, who, in spite of reiterated warnings, has always assured both the last and the present Cabinets that His Majesty’s Government would never desert Persia in her hour of dire financial need, was prostrated. He said that the Cabinet must resign, and that no one would be found to take their places. His Highness considered that sale of Crown jewels would be insufficient to-day, as they could not be sent abroad, and probably no purchaser would be forthcoming. He said that he would talk over the question of the islands with Cabinet, and seemed to think it a possible way of raising money if the British offers were made more attractive than that submitted to his predecessor, but said that it would have to be sanctioned by the Medjliss. Prime Minister, to whom I spoke on the subject some days ago, replied in the same sense. Road robberies on a larger scale are recommencing, and, if disorders ensue upon the disbandment of the gendarmerie, it is probable that Russian troops will have to be called in to preserve peace. At the same time it is impossible to recommend upon economic grounds that more money should be lent, and I cannot conscientiously say that I feel sure that if lent it would not be wasted. Conditions attached to loan of 300,000 tomans, to which allusion is made in Petrograd telegram No. 437 of 22nd September, entail Persian Government taking over a debt of 2,000,000 tomans due to Russian Bank.

As his Excellency had mentioned the fact that Russian Bank had been foolish m advancing considei able sums to Persians who were more or less insolvent, I paid that reason why 1 ersian Government objected to proceeds of taxes being paid into Russian Bank was the fact that these funds were used for recouping bank for its bad debts or to satisfy o er claims. This objection might be got over if Russian Government would guarantee that taxes paid into bank should not be used for such purposes, but should be remitted integrallv to Persian Treasury. His Excellency contended that nearly all the loans made by Russian banks to individual Persians had been made with the approval of the Persian Government, and that the latter were therefore responsible for Jiel j n * 1 1 that so long as the war lasted, and until we had time to discuss the whole Persian question thoroughly, we ought not to increase Persia’s financial difficulties by pressing tlie ckkns of our ffspective subjects, and I suggested that Russian Bank might be instructed to make over to Persian Treasury all the sums paid into it on account of taxes. His Excellency said that he would examine this question as well as t ic aide-memoire which I had given him and send me a written ansiver jt As the conversation then turned on the Persian situation I &gt; took th® opportunity of reading certain notes which I had made on bir W i ownley s despatches W 231 “id 233 in order to show that, in spite of assurances which I had received last June, conduct of Russian consuls had not changed for the better. On mv repeating w ^ have so often said before, that North Persia was fast oecoming a Russian pnmnce is Excellency retorted that Southern Persia and the Gulf districts were vntually Britn . I renlied that they were not in the occupation of our-troops, and that, while w e did &lt;dl NT dd to a-t ud to both the letter and the spirit of the 1901 agreement, Russian consuls were acting in such flagrant opposition to the t U at 1 was anythingTSeseiit ;ffimeffT'ut intrusted tlmtA close of war we should be able to arrive at some definite ’ + won l f l remove all possible misunderstandings m ^utuie. affr His N elieimy ^pressed nis entire concurrence and asked me to send him a copy of notes which 1 had read out to him.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 19, 6’25 p.m.) Tehran, September 19, ] 914. (No. 274.) (September 19, 2 p.m.) 1 ' N ; YOUR telegram No. 221 of 14th September. Persian Government is quite nnable, as the manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia here is well aware, to make necessary payment to meet coupon on the 1911 loan due to-day. This payment is included in the sum mentioned in the last paragraph of G my telegram No. 257 of 10th September as being a deficit of southern customs on 8th September to meet service of loans. There is reason to suppose that receipts would have sufficed to meet the service of the loans but for the war, since the outbreak of which trade has been at a standstill. There are no other sources of revenue from which payment could be made, and, if punctual discharge of such liabilities is to be insisted on, result will be disastrous.0 K! I » ! A ' I \ Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 19, 7'30 p.m.) Tehran, September 19, 1914. (September 19, .11-35 a.m.) (No. 275.) xX MY immediately preceding telegram. Financial situation, which has been well-nigh hopeless for some months has reached critical stage, and it seems impossible for Persia to escape bankruptcy and administrative collapse unless she receive foreign assistance. Persia has for long been sti ugglmg against inability to make her revenue cover her expenditure. There has perhaps been some culpable carelessness, and Persia’s appearance of suffering from a hereditary inability to cope with finance, but much of her recent expenditure has been forced upon her. _ Budgets of Cossack brigade and gendarmerie have been largely increased, whilst it has been impossible to curtail on a sufficiently large scale the expenditure incurred on account of local troops insisted on bv provincial Governors. Budget of brigade has been increased without reference to Persian Government, and is paid out of northern customs receipts equally without reference. That of the gendarmerie has been allowed to swell in the confident belief that neighbouring Powers would find money, as has been done in the past. I have frequently warned Ministers against trusting to foreign assistance. At present moment gendarmerie pay is 18,000L in arrears, police of Tehran, j 10,000h, and gendarmerie construction (barracks, posts on the roads, &amp;c.) account’ 72,000b Many of the Government offices have received no payment for four or five months, and Court remains unpaid. The almost entire drying up of customs receipts in the north and south is a most disquieting feature of the situation. Inland revenues from Russian zone have largely diminished owing to the fact that those payable by Russians, Russian protected persons, and in some places by Persians, are collected by Russian consuls and paid into Russian Bank, whence they do not emerge. Inland revenues had shown satisfactory increase, but cost of collection has also increased largely. Prime Minister spoke to me at great length two days ago upon the financial situation, and implored the assistance of Bis Majesty’s Government directly or through the Imperial Bank of Persia. I replied that I did not think that His Majesty’s Government would entertain any proposals unless both Governments were approached simultaneously, and I held out small hope of any help being forthcoming under existing circumstances. I said that any application for assistance should be accom panied by a clear statement of financial situation. Present Cabinet and Acting Treasurer-General express firm determination to cut down expenditure and so improve the situation, which is due in large measure to the blind faith of previous administrations in a sudden happy turn of fortune’s wheel based on no reasonably sound probability. It was childish, but Persian, and the late Treasurer-General in this respect was more Persian than the Persians. If no help from outside is forthcoming, I can only foresee total collapse of the 1 Administration and of the gendarmerie, f ollowed by, anarchy throughout the country j at a moment when we can ill take steps to remedy situation.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with unl ess required for official use.1 PGLITICAI,.

You should inform Minister for Foreign Affairs very confidentially and say that we can see no other way in which the Persian Government can get financial assist ance. The Islands do not affect the mainland in any way; the administrative connexion of these islands with Persia scarcely exists and we do not regard them as giv ing us any more footing in Persia itself, British subjects hold concessions in them.

The correspondence is relating to the financial difficulties of the Persian Government and the question of loans payment. Suggestions were made by the British Government on how the Persian Government could pay back its loans. Among the suggestions were sales of the crown jewels, or islands off Bundar Abbas. While selling the crown jewels was not an option, the sale of the islands was the subject of correspondence between the British and the Russian Governments. The Russian Government had no objections to the British Government’s purchasing the Gulf islands or to anything which The British chose to do in South Persia as long as they keep quiet about north Persia.The correspondence deals with arrangements for the payment of the loan, conditions attached to it, the agreement of terms between the British, the Persian and the Russian Governments, and the Imperial Bank of Persia. A few issues related to the loan were discussed, among which were:the proposal of joint Anglo-Russia advances of £100,000; and £400,000 to the Persian Government;the interest on loans to The Persian Government;the question of claiming compound interest on arrears of interest payable on Anglo-Indian advances;payment of the November coupon on the Imperial Government of Persia loan of 1911 of which the British government paid half of its amount, i.e. £7184 9s 4d.The file also contains correspondence relating to the behaviour of the Swedish gendarmerie in Persia. Despite the reports of His Majesty’s Consul in Kerman on their inappropriate behaviour, it was made clear that, if financial assistant was not achieved Persia would witness a total collapse of the administration of the gendarmerie followed by anarchy throughout the country.The volume’s principal correspondents are: Sir Walter Beaupre Townley, British Minister at Tehran; Sir Edward Grey, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; Major William Frederick Travers O’Connor, Acting Consul at Shiraz; Sir George William Buchanan, Ambassador of the United Kingdom to Russia; and the Imperial Bank of Persia.The volume’s core correspondence covers the period September 1914 to September 1918. The earlier start date given for the volume is a result of correspondence included in a confidential enclosure, itself dated April- March 1914, on the Swedish gendarmerie and the incidents took place in Kazerun region of Persia in the early 1914 (ff 133-138).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Shiraz</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Russian Empire</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Russia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Bank of Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kazerun</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Loans</topic></subject><subject><topic>Financial aid</topic></subject><subject><topic>Police</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000fa#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
