Despatch Nos 3U 103/1/516. Sir, BRITISH MIDDLE EAST OFFICE, 10 SHARIA TOLUMBAT, CAIRO. 6th August, 19^9. / 9943 J L I have the honour to transmit the following report on the work of the Development Division of the British Middle East Office during the second quarter of 1949. 2. The past quarter has been a very busy one for the members of the Development Division and all of them have been almost continually away from Cairo. Sir John Troutbeck and Mr. Crawford were both in London for a considerable period on duty connected with the Middle East (Official) Committee and the Middle East Working Party. Mr. Crawford also spent ten days in Bagdad while the International Bank Mission was there. His visit was made at the unofficial request of the head of the Mission. The Advisers on Forestry and Soil Conservation and on Statistics have been in almost continuous collaboration with Overseas Consultants Incorporated in Persia during the quarter. 3. Agriculture . Early in April Sir Herbert Stewart attended, as a member of the United Kingdom Delegation, the informal meeting called by the Food and Agriculture Organisation^ Regional Office in Cairo. At this meeting plans were discussed for agricultural development and food production for the Middle East. Arrangements were also made for the holding of training courses in nutrition and agricultural statistics which, it is hoped, will take place at the end of this year. From mid-April to early May he was in Cyprus where he saw the many agricultural projects now being carried out. He came away with the firm impression i that Cyprus has much to show other countries in the [Middle East and his notes written after this visit contain much that can be of value to the Middle East in general. At the request of the F.A.O. Regional Office, he asked the Cyprus Government to extend facilities for representatives of Middle East countries to see, under F.A.O. auspices, the various forms of land use development now being carried out. This co-operation has been most generously promised and a rough outline approved of what can be demonstrated and the nature of the training which can be provided for Middle East nationals. The F.A.O. Regional Office has been informed that the Cyprus Government is willing to co-operate and it is understood that the Director- General in Washington has now made official application to His Majesty’s Government for the grant of facilities on the lines agreed during Sir Herbert’s visit. I Sir Herbert Stewart next spent a fortnight in the Kingdom of the Jordan where he toured the whole of the inhabited part of the country. His views of the changes and modifications which he considers desirable in agriculture and land use have been transmitted to The Rt. Hon. Ernest Bevin, M.P., Foreign Office, London, S. W. 1. / thethe Jordan Government. During his visit he paid particular attention to schemes which might help in the settlement of Palestine refugees. His comments on these schemes have already been conveyed to the Middle East Secretariat. On his departure from Amman Sir Herbert Stewart visited Damascus to follow up the contacts made last year. He met the newly appointed Minister of Agriculture whom he reports to be keen and competent. Here again he discussed the question of the re-settlement of Palestine refugees, especially in the Jezireh area. It is interesting to note that the Director-General of Agriculture has asked this office for an Arabic translation of Sir Herbert’s report of last year. This is being supplied. On his way back to Oairo he paid another visit to Beirut where he discussed the country’s future agri cultural development problems. Soil Conservation and Forestr Mr. V.K. Maitland returned to Tehran on April 2hth and remained with the Overseas Consultants group ■until the end of May. He worked as a Section Leader of the group and, with Dr. Stuart of the U.S. Forestry Service, wrote the section of the Overseas Consultants report dealing with Forestry, Soil Conservation and Range Management. He again travelled widely through Persia and, as on his last visit, came across another famine area, this time in the Moghan Steppe near the Russian border. This was reported to Headquarters, Overseas Consultants Incorporated, and it is hoped that their representations will have resulted in relief measures being taken. It is interesting to note that while Mr. Maitland’s personal relations with the members of the Overseas Consultants Working Party were excellent, in an interview with His Imperial Majesty the Shah, at which all the chief members of the team were present, the leaders of the party in reviewing their work made no mention at all of British co-operation. Mr. Maitland, however, had a personal interview with the Shah, who showed great interest in the development of forestry and soil conservation. An unofficial request has been made that he should return, with or without the Overseas Consultants, for six months to help the Government in implementing his recommendations. No official request has yet been received and it is still hoped that the Persian Government will agree to accept a British expert chosen by Mr. Maitland. The improved draft for forestry legislation, which he drew up for the Persian Government, has now been passed by the Majlis. Mr. Maitland had no sooner returned from his extremely exacting journey throughout Persia and written a full report, the date for the production of which had unexpectedly been put forward by the Persian Government, than he was asked by the Egyptian Government to draw up a tentative plan of afforestation. After ten days concentrated touring throughout northern Egypt, he was able to produce an interim report. His report is still being studied but it seems likely to become the plaything of various conflicting parties in the Ministry of Agriculture. Interest has, however, been awakened and - - * -it is probable that certain measures of afforestation, even if they fall short of Mr. Maitland’s recommenda tions, will be put into effect. On his return from leave he will discuss his report with the Egyptian Government, While proceeding across North Africa to the United Kingdom on leave, Mr. Maitland was invited to join the Working Party which has been set up to examine the possibilities of economic development in Tripolitania. As a result he was unable to attend the World Forestry Conference at Helsinki. It is already clear that there is too much work in the fields of soil conservation and forestry in the Middle East area for one officer to carry out, and sanction to appoint an assistant is therefore being sought. Up to the present Syria and the Lebanon have received insufficient attention. This is regrettable because the Lebanon is showing signs of attempting to get something done in forestry control. A new law has been passed which exempts newly planted forests and woods from taxation for thirty years and forests that have been replanted after fire for ten years. V/hile admitting that there is a great gap between the passing of a law and putting it into practice, this law is an advance and I think that Mr. Maitland can claim a great deal of credit for it. It is, however, necessary that he should return to the Lebanon to give the further impulse which will turn the law into actuality. Another sign of awakening interest in forestry in the North is to be seen in the Arbor Day which was held in Amman on the occasion of the visit there in April of Mr. Waterer, the Conservator of Forests in Cyprus. 5. Labour. Mr. Audsley spent the greater part of the quarter at the Labour Attaches’ Conference in London. While there he had many discussions with the head quarters of the oil companies operating in the Middle East on a variety of subjects relating to the social welfare of their employees and on many of the points which had arisen from his reports on Kuweit and Bahrein. He also discussed with Professor Robson who, it will be remembered, had been commissioned by the Lebanese Government to report on social insurance, the proposed law on this subject which the Lebanese Government now intends to introduce. He also had discussions with the Ministry of Labour regarding the Trades Union officer whom the Sudan Government is endeavouring to engage. It appears that there is a recrudescence of interest in social affairs in Egypt and Mr. Audsley has been consulted more frequently of late. /6. Entomology.4 * •v^ • .*A 6. Entomology. Mr. Waterston went to Asmara at the beginning of April to meet the Director of the Desert Locust Survey, in connection with difficulties which had arisen in Oman. It will be recalled that at the Tehran Conference on the desert locust it was agreed that Pakistan should send a reconnaissance party to this area. This was duly done, and the party found signs of an incipient outbreak, against which it was unable to do very much for lack of transport and material. It was decided at Asmara that Mr. Waterston should go to the Oman and see the actual state of affairs. There he found that though the Pakistan party was doing all that it could, the difficulties in obtaining co-operation from the local population were practically insurmountable. It is feared that some of the locust swarms will have escaped from this area. In May Mr. V/aterston visited Cyprus in connection with the proposed scheme for ecological research with a view to controlling the Moroccan locust. It had previously been proposed that a research unit should be set up there, but in view of the delay which now seems inevitable, this Office has made the suggestion that Mr. Waterston should spend part of next year in Cyprus in order to make a start in this research. The Moroccan locust is a widespread pest throughout Syria, Iraq and Iran, i and the value to this office of having sin expert actually directing research in Cyprus will be considerable. The Regional Office of the Pood and Agriculture Organisation has finally decided to hold a conference on the Moroccan locust in Beirut in September, though it has been pointed out to them more than once that for various technical reasons it would be better to postpone the conference until January. ?• Public Health. Dr. Bozman has been fully occupied in making further contacts with the Public Health Services of Egypt. He has also visited Bagdad, Damascus and Beirut, in order principally to examine requests for medical staff from the United Kingdom. It is now clear that with the institution of the National Health Service it is becoming extremely difficult to obtain United Kingdom medical officers to fill vacancies in the Middle East. This is also in great part due to the unattractive conditions of service and to the salaries which are being offered, especially in Iraq and Syria. I have already pointed out in my despatch No.16 of 3rd June, 1949, that a system of secondment from British services seems to offer a solution. I understand that this suggestion is now being considered in London. It would be a great pity to weaken our medical connection with Iraq, although the number of specialists asked for could probably be reduced. It also seems desirable, from many /points_ 5 points of view, that the United Kingdom should obtain a footing in the improved School of Medicine which the Syrian Government is attempting to set up. This will not of course be plain sailing for there is a language difficulty in that the number of students who speak fluent English is very small. It also seems desirable that one or two posts in the American University at Beirut should, if possible, be held by United Kingdom nationals, especially if the suggestion of Mr. Hoskins of the Standard Oil Company is adopted for the posting of students from the Persian Gulf to Beirut for training. A request was in fact made for a radiologist, but the time allowed was so short that it was not possible to meet the request. In general, the difficulty in supplying staff for medical posts is hampering Dr. Bozman’s work, in that on his return visits to the countries concerned he is merely faced with a repetition of the demands for staff put forward on his previous visit. Statistics, Dr. Murray has spent the whole of this quarter in Tehran, in collaboration with Overseas Consultants Incorporated. He has written the statistical section of the latter’s report for the Persian Government. The Government have asked for Dr. Murray to be seconded to their service for a year, but considerable delay has taken place in the completion of the negotiations. Though this delay has enabled Dr. Murray to proceed further with his plans for the setting up of a central statistical bureau at Tehran, it has meant that other Middle East countries have had to be neglected. It is proposed that, when Dr. Murray’s secondment has been finally arranged with the Persian Government, a statistician should be appointed to replace him for the period of his absence and a suitable candidate is already in sight. Animal Husbandry After nearly a year’s search, a suitable expert for the post of Animal Husbandry Adviser has been found. It is hoped that arrangements will be made for him to join the Development Division in September. Desert Locust Surve: Complete liaison is being maintained between the Desert Locust Survey (referred to in paragraph 6 above) and the Development Division, especially as regards the anti-Desert Locust activi ties of the Egyptian, Pakistan and Persian Governments. British Council, When in London, Mr. Crawford attended a meeting at the British Council, where plans for / lec ture6 . lecture tours on land use subjects were discussed with especial reference to further action after these tours. It was agreed that the advice of the experts of the Development Division should be sought before students and graduates are sent to the United Kingdom for study courses. 12. Food &amp; Agriculture Organisation . The improvement in relations between this Organisation and the Development Division, mentioned in my last Quarterly Report, continues. It is believed that the request of the Egyptian Government for a report on forestry by Mr. V.K. Maitland originated with Hefnawy Pasha, the Head of the Regional Office of F.A.O. 13 # As so many of the advisers were on duty or*on leave outside Egypt while this Report was being drafted, it has not been possible to include in it their detailed reports. l[ u I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Cairo, Tehran, Bagdad, Jedda, Addis Ababa, Angora and Washington, H j s Majesty’s Ministers at Beirut, Damascus, Tel Aviv and Amman, H.M. Consul-General at Jerusalem, to Their Excellencies the Governors of Cyprus and Aden, to the Civil Secretary, Khartoum, the Political Resident Bahrein, His Excellency the U.K. High Commissioner New Delhi, His Excellency the U.K. High Commissioner Karachi, the Foreign Office Administration for. African Territories Agency, Cairo, The Commissioner- General for South-East Asia, and to the Commanders- in-Chief, Middle East Forces.
