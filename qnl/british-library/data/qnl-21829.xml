I forward herewith for your information the particulars of a German engineer (probably a Jew) named Karl Heinz MAIBR who is working in the M.S. rt Aase Maersk”, a tanker of the Maerak Line. The ship runs between Abadan and Batavia; she called at Colombo on 6.10.39. MAKER was taken off and kept in custody during the ship^ stay in Port and only placed on board again shortly before the ship was due to sail. This was done in spite of Governments order that enemy alien crews on neutral ships are only to be detained on board, because M.S. rt Aase Maersk' was lying alongside the oiling Jetties and in close proximity to H.M.S.Cornwall, and it was felt that no risk of any hostile act by MAI3K could be taken. 2. MAKER stated that he had been working in the M.S.Aase Maerak for about three months without getting ashore, and he appealed to be interned here. He may do some deliberate act while at a British port, so as to force the British Government to intern him. He says that he has not been back to Germany for over a year and that his relatives are in Italy. Holder of German Passport No.37/38, Algiers, 2.9.38 — 2.9.39.Confidential D.O.

The reply to both points raised bv the wclosure^ )_ . \ v Political Agent, Bahrein, in his telegram of the 21st October is in the affirmative. It is true that some doubt exists with regard to point (b) wnich could be removed by amending the Persian Gulf States (Emergency) Order in Council so as to make Section 9 of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act applicable to the Gulf States. But since, as will be seen from the Foreign Office letter, legal opinion is fairly confident that the prerogative powers of arrest and detention persist, and having regard to the legal obstacles in the way of any pro ceedings instituted by an enemy alien to quash a detention order, it is not considered necessary to pursue the question of amending the Order in Council. f Attention is invited, however, to paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Foreign Office letter from which it will be seen that it is open to a detained enemy seaman to take certain steps whicn, under at any rate British practice, will secure his release and repatriation. In these, circumstances, and subject to any views which you and the Government of India ma. y/may wish to express, it will seem that the Foreign Cffice are probably right in suggesting that there may be little to be gained by the removal of German seamen from neutral ships in Bahrein or Koweit, unless of course there are some exceptional reasons for such action in a particular case.P.Z. -7680/59.

(It may, incidentally, be noted that that clause has not been adapted in its application to tne Persian Gulf eiiioorics, as io pernaps ought to have been.) . n Th( r* G are ’ however, good grounds for the Political Resident s suggestion that vis-a-vis the enemy subject no legal sanction is necessary. An alien enemy has in fact no nguts wnatsoever, and, apart altogether from any statutory ?2^ r + -?

I enclose a copy of a minute on the subject by our Third Legs! Adviser. You will see that Dean feels fairly sure that the statutory power to deport would not b© held to exclude the undoubted prerogative power to intern. nevertheless, there may be some doubt about the question, and if you think i. desirable that the lolltloal Agent should sxeiciae these powers, you may wish to consider whether it would be worth while to amend the Persian Gulf tates ( mergency) Crder in Council so as to make eotion 9 of the iuergencv i owers (defence) Act applicable to Gulf territories. 2. In order to assist you in reaching a decision on the matter, it may be useful to set cut the practice in thi*? country with r egerd to the internment of seamen who ore enoiry aliens. &gt;n officer or seaman of enemy nationality has the right under the Hogue Convention Ko. XX of 1907 to give an undertaking in a prescribed form not to engage in eny service in connection with the war while hostilities last. Anyone who signs such on undertaking must bs allowed to leave if he wishes. Fe understand that the authorities here do not encourage German sailors to make use of this right, but if any of them ask of their own accord to sign the undertaking, we honour it and repatriate them. Otherwise, the question of internment is a matter for the decision of the .ecurity Authorities and this holds good whether the neutral ship enters British waters voluntarily or is compulsorily diverted* 4. If, therefore the I olitical Agent takes steps to remove German members of th© crew from neutral ships, he may find himaelf under an obligation to repatriate some or all of them. In these circumstances you may perhaps feel that little is to be gained by removing Genaun sailors from neutr? 1 ships in Bahrein waters. Yours ever, neutral ships d/- H.Ii. yres.P.z. 402 / 40 .

Enemy subjects who arerr/ bona fide members of the crew of a neutral vessel are apparently exempt from capture, and if detained on other grounds, the terms of the Convention would not apply. 2 It is observed that the practical value of the removal Admiralty messages ho.0034 of 13th October and 1152 of 11th November 1939 (copy enclosed for ready reference) conveying 3 . In this connection attention is also invited, to the 34 of 1 certain instructions to His Majesty’s Ships regarding the removal of enemy aliens from neutral vessels* From these instructions it would appear that it is not the policy of His Majesty’s Government to remove enemy aliens who are members of the crew of neutral ships simply on the groundof German or enemy nationality. Removal is allowed only in specified circumstances and in specified areas. 4. The Government of India therefore consider it desir- a hie, subject to any further remarks by the Political Resident, that the Political Agents concerned in the Persian Gulf should be given definite instructions on the lines of the Admiralty messages enclosed regarding the circumstances in which enemy subjects should be removed from neutral ships. They are of the opinion that it would not be proper to lay down that no arrest or detention should be made on the ground that there is little to be gained by removing German seamen from neutral ships in Bahrain or Kuwait. Circumstances may arise in which it may be necessary to do so. THE ISSUE OF THE ABOVE IUS BEEN AUTHORISED. sd. tf.R.Hay. Deputy Secretary to the Government of India.Secret* Copy of signals.

The question was first raised last October by the Political Agent, Bahrain, in view of the possibility that some members of Danish and Norwegian tanker crews may be Germans. Developments in Scandinavia may possibly have made the question, in this particular aspect, rather academic. But it may be that the Political Resident would welcome some general guidance on the question of detaining enemy aliens found on board neutral ships whether as passengers or as members of the crew, and, pending the receipt of any further observations he may wish to send, you may like to consider, as one of the issues involved, the Government of India's criticism of the view that an obligation may arise to repatriate a German removed from a neutral ship to the crew of which he belonged. 3. With regard to the Government of India’s last paragraph it was not our intention, nor i think was it yours, to suggest an absolute prohibition on the removal of enemy aliens from meutral ships calling at Bahrain or Kuwait. Special circumstances might well arise in which the Political Agent would have to be asked, or might feel called upon on his own initiative, in the light of evidence he had received, to exercise his powers to arrest and detain enemy aliens fnund on board neutral ships.

Please see your letter P.Z.2272/4C of the 30th April about the jurisdiction of the Political Agents at Kuwait and Bahrain over neutral ships. in the Government of India's lettef to the Secretary of State of the 12th April applies to all Germans found in neutral ships on the high seas or brought into British ports for contraband control. .Neutral ships which call voluntarily in the ordinary course of trade submit them- board them are accordingly liable to arrest and to intern ment in the United Kingdom or deportation according to the decision of the Security Service. Since it appears to be agreed that the Political Agents are armed with adequate powers for this purpose, they should be in a position to exercise a similar discretion to the Security Service in the light of local conditions, in case the point should be raised, Germans who are officers or members of the crews of captured German ships are no longer, in view of the barbarous German conduct of the war at sea, being given the opportunity prescribed in Article 6 of the Eleventh Hague Convention to obtain release by undertaking to abstain from hostile action against His Majesty's Government during the war. it may therefore be assumed that German sailors from neutral ships in accordance with the Admiralty signal will be similarly treated. 3. As regards the third paragraph of your letter, it was certainly not our intention to suggest that enemy aliens in neutral ships calling at Bahrain or Kuwait should in no circumstances be removed, in view of the new situation created by the invasion of Scandinavia, it will be most desirable to detain German members of the crews of Danish and Norwegian ships, it may also be worth while to point out that Danish and Norwegian ships which we have taken over will not be neutral but Allied ships, so that there would be no limitations on the right to remove Germans from them, - which should presumably be done at the first opportunity. 2.
