COMPILED IN THE INTELLIGEKCE BEANCH OF THE QUARTER MASTER GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT IN INDIA. SIMLA: PIUNTED AT THE GOVERNMENT CENTRAL PRINTING OFFICE,PREFACE. SECTION III contains all routes starting from Russian territory and extending south as far as a line drawn from Karmanshah south -eastwards through Burujird, Isfahan and Yazd to Kar- man, and thence north-east through Khabis and Neh to Lash Juwain. The 46th and 62nd degrees of E. Longitude may be roughly taken as the western and eastern boundariea. The 1887 edition of this work forms the basis of the present compilation, and all later information has been incorporated. Alphabetical indices of all routes and stages are given at the beginning of the book. An index route map and one showing the limit of each of the three sections of the Persian Uoute Book will be found in the pocket of each book. Detailed descriptions of places and districts are to be found in the Persian Gazetteer. Names of places have, as far as possible, been spelt in accordance with the Survey of India maps of the N.-W. T. E. and S. W. A. Series on the scale of 1' = 8 miles. This section has been compiled, under the superintendence of Captain E. E. H. McSwiney, l).S.O., Deputy Assistant Quarter Master General, by Lieutenant D. 11. Adye, 6th Infantry, Hyderabad Contingent, and finally revised and completed by Captain G. A. Robertson, 15th Bengal Lancers. Information received too late for incorporation in the body of the work has been put in as an appendix. G. II. MORE-MOLYNEUX, Assistant Quarter IntelligNo. r.

E. by E, The road in most places was very bad ; the plain, as far as one could judge at this season, appeared a series of rice-fields, divided by hedges of brambles and tall reeds, which are so high and close, that from the road the whole country ap peared covered with a thick, low jungle. Once or twice came upon a part of Shah Abbas' an cient causeway, which is here only to be dis tinguished by a few ^ yards of hard, paved road, occasionally interrupting the broken and muddy track. After nearly 5 farsahhs, came to the Babil, 2 miles from Barfarush. Crossing over fine bridge of nine arches, continued a^short distance farther over a villainous road, and then entered the town. 2 A liabad 12 • 34 Started for Aliabad, a village about half-way between Barfarush and Sari. Road lay throuo-h alternate jungle and rice-fields along the remains of causeway. This, for an occasional 200 or 300 yards, was almost as good as new; but the remainder was broken up, or, wherever it had been disused for a short time, totally overgrown by the encroaching jungle, and the path turned aside among the neighbouring swamps. At about 10 miles from Barfarush forded the river Talar, now almost dry ; the bed is nearly 350 yards across. After 12 miles, entered Aliabad. 3 S aiu 14 48 Proceeded along causeway for about 4 miles, to river Siah-rud, a small stream, crossed by means of a bridge. Wherever there have been water courses, there have been originally bridges, which in most places are now destroyed, and it is in these parts, that the causeway is so broken up. During this march it was in much better condil tion than between Aliabad and Barfarush. Itia of different width in different places, but gen erally about 20 feet, with a ditch on each side. After passing the Siah-rud, turned off into forest and, having crossed several large patches of r i C Q swamp, arrived at village of Afrakut, the prop er ^No. 1— contd.

Continuing march over a beautiful smooth turf along the foot of hills, passed village of Surki Kala. Some dis tance farther on, at 2 miles from Sari, again fell in with the causeway, along which march continued till the city, altogether about 3 farsahhs distant from Aliabad. Causeway is here about 20 feet wide and in good condition; it is not paved as before, but has the appearance of a good English country road. Passing through the gateway, proceeded along a road, built by Shah Abbas, in the same manner as the causeway, lying N. and S. in a direct line to Farahabad. It had lately been paved for a short distance from the gate, and was in good condition. For about 8 miles continued along this road, alternately through rice-fields and forest. Path now became broken up and was lost in jungle; so, turning aside, continued through the fields. Came to village of Ahan, and farther on Amul, both of which, with several others in vicinity, are inhabited by the Jambeglu and Modanlu Kurds. Near last-mentioned place was a large grassy mound. At about 2 miles from Farahabad came upon a fine, open plain of smooth turf, at the extremity of which, in direc tion of the sea, ruins of a fine mosque and sarai, broken down walls and arches, extending many hundred yards, indieated the ManziL Forded river near remains of bridge and com menced march to Kara Tapa. Path lay for many miles along seashore. Left the seaside at a place where stood remains of an old tower. Road now lay through a wide swampy plain employed in rice cultivation, in the midst of which the village of Nausirabad is situated. Continued for 3 or 4 miles through this kind of country, along the narrow ridges which formed the pathway, and emerged on a magnificent plain, but exhibiting no signs oi cultivation. After several miles, came in sight of Kara Tapa, which is built on a dark- coloured mound rising abruptly from the plain. Crossed plain in the direction of Ashraf. Ground was more swampy than that traversed yesterday. On approaching nearer the mountains, entered a more cultivated district, and road lay through wheat and barley fields, interspersed with cottages3 No. \~~contd.

Passing through small vil lage of Zirawan, came once more upon the old causeway, and, crossing it, went round the foot of an almost precipitous hill, on which Sufiabad is built. Ascended it by a narrow, winding path ; and half-way up, where the ascent becomes less steep, are the remains of an arched gateway and a strong wall extending about 200 yards along the side of the hill. Continued winding to the summit, when passing two more gateways—the one in a dilapidated tower, and the other in a wall, about 15 feet high—came to the square terrace on which the house is built. Then des cended the hill, and in less than a quarter of an hour arrived at Ashraf. Cf. Route No. 217, stage 11. 7 R akiabdin 6 98 Proceeded as far rs the village of Rakiabdin. Koad from Ashraf lay through the forest along the causeway, which is here very dilapidated and painful to horses, being formed of large stones procured from the rocks in the neighbourhood. The distance from Kara Tapa to Eakiabdin is 3 farsakhs, Ashraf lying exactly half-way. 8 G az 20 118 The mountains, here thinly wooded, lay close on right, .and at first the road was along the cause way, occasionally turning aside among the ploughed fields to avoid some peculiarly dilapi dated spots. Shortly after setting out, passed the villages of Kalagh and Kalapani, hid among the trees on left ; and then for about 2 miles proceeded through a low, thick jungle of fern and brambles. Farther on, passed Tilietash, Tilinuh, Imran, and Harmindzamin, all small villages situated close to one another at the foot of the hills on right. Several burying-grounds lay by the roadside. Having crossed several beds of mountain torrents, came to that of the river Kulbad, about 50 yards broad and now quite dry ; but, from the appearance of the banks and the large stones lying in the channel, very diffi cult to ford in the spring. The village of Kul bad lay further north towards the sea. A mile fai*ther on came to the Hair-i-Kulbad (ditch of Kulbad), which forms the boundary between the provinces of Astrabad and Mazandaran. It is a dry ditch about 10 yards wide and 5 deep. The Hair-i-Kulbad is i3-| farsaklis (18 miles) from Ashraf and 2 farsakhs from Gaz. Continued march through the forest.

About 4 miles from Gaz, road lav between two low mounds, part of an ancient city, called Barbar. kfarsaich farther than this, crossed the dry bed of another torrent (Kurd- Mahala-Chai), the large village of that name, being passed by it about miles to north of road ; 12 miles hence arrived at Kafsigiri, al- Wether about 20 miies distant from Gaz. The ivurd-Mahala-Chai divides the districts of Anazun and Sadam Eustak. Travelled nearly all day along the causeway, which at setting out was broad and good, but latterly had much de- tenorated ; it lay chiefly through a thick forest, in which were many very fine trees,—oak, sycamore, and beech. From Kafsigiri to Astrabad is about 3 over liat country skirting mountains, partly cul tivated and partly overrun with jungle.

Eoad still ascends with river up a narrow valley, very barren and sterile, to a spot about 13 miles from Khalse, where river runs through a rocky precipitous pass. The river about here (the Lar) is crossed by a very insecure bridge. Ab-i-Garm is about 12 miles from this spot, the road run ning through a fine fertile valley. Ab-i-Garm possesses a hot mineral spring having noted healing properties. From Ab-i-Garm there is a road to Tehran up the Lar valley to a village called Labu, and then over the Elburz to Tehran by Gulhak. The distances quoted are only approximate.6 No. 4.

Route No. 217, stage 6. 1 Parusp 16 16 Road leads in a S. direction for 18 miles^ along the west bank of Haraz through thick jungle, or in places up bed of river. At 6th mile enters a valley, 400 yards broad, through which the stream flows to plain. Road then runs along bed of stream; and at 11th mile, valley closing in on both sides, road ascends left bank of river by narrow causeway, in some places not more than 3' or 4/ broad, cut in steps on side of the hill, and formed of layers of wood and stone placed on deep clay, the natural soil of the hill. This causeway is almost impassable to horsemen and laden mules, and is fast falling into utter decay, numberless mountain streams and the incessant rains of the country having washed away in many places the materials of which it is made. The remains of an ancient and more substantial road, built up against the solid rock on the other side of the stream, are visible, and are probably the work of Shah Abbas ; but earthquakes and torrents have nearly destroyed it, and travellers prefer the modern causeway, although the dis tance by it is greater. At 13th mile, road again descends to the bed of the stream, but occa sionally runs over causeways similar to the one above described, but shorter in extent. The hills cease to be wooded within about 2 miles of Parus, a ruined and deserted building, which may once have been a sarai. Supplies in small quantities procurable, but with great difficulty. 2 Khaeu 15 31 Beyond Parusp, still pursuing a S. course, road improves, from hardness of rock over which it passes and from the dryness of climate. It is, however, in some places only a narrow pathway, built upon or scooped out of face of a perpendi cular rock overhanging the torrent, and will not admit of a horseman passing along it. Frequent accidents are said to occur from landslips and fragments loosened by sudden thaws in the mountains. Between Parusp and Kharu, the stream is crossed in two places by wooden bridges, near the remains of stone ones which have been swept away by the torrent. At Kharu some caves, cut in the side of the hill, afford shelter to the traveller ; no supplies.No. 4— conoid. A mul to T ehran, via Ask. No. of stage. Names of stages.

Pathway, in some places not more than 3' broad, is scooped out of the face of the rock about 200' above the torrent. The defile is only just practicable for a laden mule. This strong, natural defile, about a mile in length, is said to be the only entrance on the N. side into the district of Larijan. Beyond the defile the road improves, and after the I'ith mile, at Wana, it turns S. W. and passes through several fine villages at the imme diate S. E. foot of Mount Damavand, forming the district of Amiri. Before it reaches Ask, 8 miles farther, the stream is crossed in six places by wooden bridges. Cf. Route No. 11, stage 7. At a short distance from Ask road leaves the river, and ascends the S. shoulder of Bamavand. The ascent is steep and rocky. Point at which road turns the shoulder of the mountain is about 1,300' above the stream. This road is impas sable in winter, when horsemen cannot approach Larijan in this direction, but foot passengers contrive to scramble over the rocks immediately above the bed of the river. The descent is com paratively easy, and much shorter than the ascent; but road is execrable, being: almost blocked up with masses of rock and half-frozen snow. Near the foot of the mountain, the river is joined by a rapid stream called the Lar, flowing from the N. W. This is crossed by a stone bridge. Road thence ascends the bed of the Haraz, which is here a mountain torrent, fording it about 30 times in 2 miles ; and for the last 2 or 3 miles, before arriving at Imamzada Hashim, which marks the summit of pass, steep and rocky pathway is scarcely practicable to a laden mule. From Imamzada Hashim descent is gradual. Road takes a W. direction, and after 4 miles turns to S. into a (rich valley, with a fine stream running from the N., on which is situ ated village of Ali, also called Tak-i-zamrud. Near village of Rudian, about 6 miles beyond Ali, road joins that which leads from Jajrud to village of Bamavand on main road to Tehran. For an account of this part of the road vide Route No. 217.

Continuing in similar country reaches, after 6f hours, encampment of the Dovoji (20 alachuk). After leaving village, track goes through confused jumble of hills for 2 miles, and then reaches a more open country. Thence crosses the river : crossing very difficult owing to depth and rapidity of stream : very steep banks : then reaches a few alachuk. The bound ary between the Astrabad and Bujnurd Govern ments occurs near here in the district of Ganjai, the district E. of which is called Shirlach. The mountain to. N. of river is called Kuliatan. Here a, road from north crosses the range and joins in. It is a good deal used by Armenian merchants. Curzon's statement (volume I, page 193) that the Russians have a road from Chik- ishliar to Bujnurd is misleading, as although such a route would be practicable in the dry season,^ it is quite superseded by the Kizil Ar- vat-Bujnurd road, both from its nearness, and from the greater importance of Kizil Arvat as a starting point. The valley sensibly narrows and track keeps cross ing low hills. At 3 2 miles reaches Akchanim and further on^ Kalmuk Kala is visible, both old forts in ruins built against the Turkomans. This march is an easy one: camp among the Gokhan Turkomans of the Khel Guzl Division. Track leads up the Kotal-i-Hanaki; the going is extremely steep, so much so that it is im possible to ride. The snow lies from about half way up. The top is 3,400' high. Looking N. the country very much resembled the raised plan of a hilly country, while to the east the hills rose to about 4,000', and seemed to bar the end of the valley. Looking to the south, count less hillocks with snow on their northern slopes. Then descend into a waterless and lifeless country, until after seven hours riding, reach a mud ruin of a fort called Ament, and giving its name to the Ament River. Camped round it, are some alachuk of Toktamash Goklars, who came from Russia some three months ago, to escape the Russian tyranny. Road as before lay through a low hilly country, waterless in summer, but covered with snow at this period of the year.

On left is steep side of a hill, thickly clothed with forest. In an hour's travelling bed of river is reached, in which road continues for about a mile and-a.half, and then commences an ascent, most painful and difficult for horses, which is all but impracticable from slipperiness. Reached a level space, about four miles from the summit of the mountains, at a sufficient height above the sea for the snow to lie. Above, high masses of rock, covered with snow, rose like an impassable barrier. Path was difficult. Near top there was half a foot of snow on the ground. At last attained the summit, and commenced a gradual descent by a broad, dry, and well-beaten road. The country presented a very different aspect to that lately traversed, for tl»e hills were now half bare, merely dotted here and there with a few stunted firs. Continued the descent along a deep and narrow valley and arrived at some caves in the side of the mountain. There are several of them of sufficient extent to accommodate some 20 or 30 horses. The place is called Magassi ; a clear rivulet flows near at hand, and it is a con venient halting place for muleteers between Mian dara and Chahardeh, being nearly equi-distant from both. 3 C hahaedeh 16 : go After about a mile, turned east over a level plain where in summer the Governor of Astrabad en camps. A small stream of delicious water runs through it. About half a mile farther, turned at a right angle into another plain, which gradually narrowed into a valley, and terminated in a steep, rocky pass. The road lay over this, and about three-quarters of a mile on the other side, entered a curious defile, about three yards broad, the rocks rising on each side 50 or 60 feet perpendicularly, like immense walls, called the Shamshirbur. A small stream flows through it, now frozen ; great difficulty in getting through the pass. The whole length of the defile is not more than 60022 No. 19—-co u td.

Passing a mud Imamzada, which stands on the confines of village, proceeded in a south-west direction across a well-cultivated plain, watered by several rivulets, and everywhere dotted with remains of small round towers. About three miles from village passed ruins of a large, circular mud fort. Continued three or four miles farther in the same direction, and then left road, turning west over some low, barren hilfe&gt; crusted with soda, to Chashma-i-Ali. The spring was situated about 7 miles from Cha- hardeh, in a wild and desolate looking spot. Continued march south and reached Kalata, a village about three-quarters of a mile from the- spring ; then turning south-west, entered a plain surrounded by rocky mountains, and having the- appearance of an immense basin. Towards the south-east signs of cultivation wpre visible ; but by far the greater part was a waste, barely afford ing subsistence to a few flocks of sheep. Aftex^ crossing the plain, traversed some low hills and arrived at Chashma-i-Ali. Proceeding alternately over low hills and narrow pluins, passed Astana, around which was a con siderable extent of cultivated land. A few miles* farther, reached the village of Baba Hafiz, en closed within four walls, with towers at the- angles, and looking like a square fort. Continuing onward, crossed the Chashma-i-AIi stream, and turning south, arrived at the village 1 of Ayanu. After travelling about twoyctrsak/is through soli tary valleys among the mountains, came to a spring, from where Damghan and several sur rounding villages were visible to the east on edge of a vast salt plain, the commencenient of the desert of Khorasan.23 Ko. 19— contd.

Continued route in a gen eral west direction, through the same desolate scenery of plains and mountains, without seeing a single village or human being.

From this fountain the road lay west through a series of ravines formed by low hills, finally reaching edge of an elevated slope, overlooking a vast plain, in the centre of which Samnan was visible, 14 miles distant.

Thence it runs up and down round the first hills for another five miles till a second kotal is reached 400 feet higher still. From that there is a steep descent, zigzagged out of the hill-side^ down to a rocky gorge surmounted by a Tur koman watch-tower, some 3 miles below. The ravine here is barely 20 feet wide, and the road is blasted out of the rocks in the bed of a nullah, and must be flooded out in the spring rains. There is a bridle path, though, over the hills, which is about half a mile shorter than the road. From the gorge the road winds steadily down to the village, which lies to the south of the Duringar stream just at the point where it enters a long gorge in the hills with high cliffs on either side. The stream is full of small fish. The village contains 50 families of Pahlwanla Kurds and seems to have a lot of rooms to let to travellers. Supplies plentiful, but rates are higher than off the road. 2 Im AMGtTtil 6 ,800'. 8 23 The road runs up the banks of the Duringar stream for the first four miles, three of which are through a rocky gorge with precipitous cli ffs on either side.

Stewart gives 26 miles as the distance. No. 30 * C£. Route- From Isfazar the road ascends gradually for about 5 miles, when there is a sharp little ascent to the top of a pass, over the main range of the Main- abad rid^e, itself a continuation of the Sam and Shahi range. From the top of this pass, which is called the Gudar-i-Darmian, there is a fine view of high hills, to the N.E. the Gazik Kuh range and to the S.W. the Bagiran. The road then descends rather steeply into the head of the- Darmian valley or glen ; but neither the ascent nor descent of this pass is very difficult, and both could easily be made practicable for guns. A short distance on a stream of water is reached,, and the path goes along it the whole way into Darmian. The road so far is also described in Route No. 34. This is a considerable village of about 200 houses in the midst of a perfect garden? of luxuriant cultivation, which extends oyer every inch of cultivable ground in the glen, which,, however, is only about 500 or 600 yards broad,, and continuing down it for 3 miles further when it joins that of the village of Furk. This latter has a considerable name in these parts as; a place of strength which is not altogether un deserved. It is situated on a hill about 200 or 260' high, but is commanded by other hills to the N.W. and S. The fort is supplied with three large tanks of water,, said to be sufficient for a large garrison for a year and-a-half. There are- large granaries here, estimated as capable of af fording storage for rations for 30,000 men for one month. There is also a good supply of donkeys, but there is no other means of trans port. From Furk to Gazik the road first goes over a plain for 8 miles, then over an uneven sort of range for another 8^ and then a low but steep pass is ascended, and Gazik is at your feet, a patch of green in the midst of brown, rugged hills. It is the frontier village of Khorasan on this road, and is situated in an amphitheatre^ about 2 miles in diameter, surrounded on all sides but the S.S.E. by hills. The village has 300 houses and a strongish little fort on a mound in * btewart (1883) gives the same route (from native information ?),with exactly the same stages, but different distances, making the total 200 miles.

The first E .S .E. to Anar- dara, which is about 90 miles off, the longest by four days' march. The second goes to Sabzawar, 115 miles distant, but has little water and no villages. The third is the direct road, and has water at all stages. 4 Burj Gulwaeda 3,030'. 15 86 From Gazik the direct road leads straight over the hill, while the longer, but level, road passes by Ahwaz, leaving that village a little fco the right; thence it enters the hills which are quite easy and open, by a miniature defile called the Dahan Awaz, for 3 miles, whence it emerges and goes over easy, open hills for 1 mile ; then over spurs from the range to the left in a direction of 30° for 3 miles, to an easy pass over the main rano-e. It then descends into the bed of a stream in which it continues for | a mile, and then over a vast, barren, stony, and desolate plain, ia a direction of 70 or 75°. Burj Gulwarda is simply a tower erected on a low ridge which runs across the plain near a pool of bad water. 5 S hokab 2,430'. 20 106 The road continues across an open, level plain, partly covered with sand, in a direction of 30° for the first 8 miles ; then 20° to the 12th mile, when, ascending slightly over undulating, hilly ground, the spring of Shorab is reached at the 20th mile. The water here is brackish, but quite drinkable. 6 Y azdan * 2,313'. 30 136 The road passes over at first undulating, hilly, but quite open, ground ; then over the same sort of plain as in the last march, in a direction of 50° which continues to about the 18th mile, when, crossing another little ridge, a spot called ** Kabu- dah ' is arrived at, a regular little oasis in this sandy desert. Here there is a swampy patch of ground covered with reeds. Many small bushes, such as the tamarisk and oleander, grow around, and there is a bit of green grass at the foot of a ruined tower. The water is salt and unpalatable. Thence crossing a low hill Yazdan is seen in the distance. Here there is a strong little fort and houses for about twenty families. Good water and some supplies are procurable.40 No. W-^concld. B irjand to H erat, via Yazdan. No. of stage. Names of stages. Distances IN MILES. fnterme- diate. Total. R emaem.

It then, after running quite level for about 12 miles, gets among low hills, and ascends the shoulder of these for an other 8 or 9 miles to a well of very bad water called ' Keland.' This is the only water be tween Yazdan and Moghal Bacha, but it was so brackish when Colonel iVJ acGregor traversed this route in 1875, that the animals would not drink it. From the Keland spring the road continues over an extensive and uninteresting plain for some 10 miles, and then over undulating ground for the last 5 or 6 miles, to the well of Moghal Bacha, the water of which is cool and sweet. Over the same uninteresting waste as the last day's march, covered with thorn scrub and with hills, now near on the right, now far off on the left. ^ Parah is the first village on the road in Af ghanistan, though the frontier of Afghanistan lies some 10 miles east of Yazdan. It is a small village of ]00 houses, each house having a sort of separate enclosure. The road proceeds at first over a waste of undulating, stony ground, but the limits of cultivation in the Herat valley are soon reached, and the remainder of the route lies through this far-famed fertile region. At 8th mile the village of Kargan is reached, and at about the llth. mile that of Deh-i«Minar, Here there is a road to Zindajan, a large village on the road to Mashad, distant 15 miles.

This route is considered in three sections; of which I and III are in frequent use, and have been already reported on in detail, vide Route No. 37, Section III of Persian Route Book, Section II therefore is alone reported on, in detail here. Route No. 37 makes the distance Birjand to Aliabad 130 miles, whereas Maula Baksh puts it at 150 miles. The main difference occurs between Neh and Aliabad given by the Route Book as 17\ and by Maula Baksh as 34 miles. Proposed as an alternative to the more circuitous route vid Nasratabad and Seistan, The advantages claimed for this route {via the Palang-koh) are:— {a) It is 70 miles shorter than the old route. (5) Many water courses on the Seistan road are avoided. (c) Seistan fly and other evils injurious to camels, are avoided. (d) There is abundance of camel graz ing available.R oute N o. f vfn- No. / D istances. of Stage, Names of stages Inter mediate. Total. E emakks. Miles.

Madeh was deserted about 12 years ago but if, as seems possible, the place could be again brought under cultiva- tion. it could not only support but/supply the next stagej could alscO 1 Sandawa. Camel-grazing and firewood abound near the fort. 2 Safidawa ,, t 15 29 The road runs in a south easteidy direc tion over a level plain, dotted with tamarisk trees, except close to Safidawa, where it enters a bare, rugg'ed, narrow valley. Safidawa is the name of a small spring of brackish but drinkable water. Firewood and camel-grazing is obtain able, but no supplies. From here the best route to the Shela river is via Poghi and Sangar-i-Mir Alam Khan; but no water exists at either of these places. It is therefore advisable 'o make a stage at Chungi Shor (called by Persians Gurg-i-Takht) between those two places. 3 \ Chungi Shor (Gurs^- i-Takht.) 28 57 The road avoids the irregular broken Ground which lies at the foot of the slopes of the Palang Koh, and runs over a level plain. At 19 miles is Poghi, where there is neither water nor firewood. At Chungi Shor there are both. An experimental well is under construction. 4 Gali -Chali . 26 83 A level road crosses the open plain and the Hamun. When the latter is in flood, the journey may be broken on its banks and a detour made next day. When not in flood the direct road leads south-east cross the sandy bed of the Hamun.

Note. —The route from Yartik-Kala to crest of ridge was not surveyed, but the line it takes was visible from the direct bridle path. The Persian guns were dragged up by hand. There is no means of avoiding this high ridge save by a detour by the Chat-i-Ghandiivfor it maintains a nearly uniform height as far as Dingalan, a consider able elevation, 20 miles west along the ridge. The path crossing route at the 7th mile from Kizlar Khalasi follows stream to junction with Khartul stream, and then enters a' very narrow and rugged defile known as the Chahel Guzr, or 40 crossings. This route was surveyed down to the Atrak, having been described as the best route into the Atrak valley from the Atrak and the- northern tributaries. A narrow path leads from side to side of the defile, barely affording passage through dense jungle for single horsemen; and the stream, which in rainy weather would offer a serious obstacle, has to be constantly crossed and recrossed. A road fit for guns at drv seasons might be mnde without much difficulty, and would turn the inaccessible slones of the Buzda- glii and Ak Chashmn mountains which extend for many miles on either flank of the defile.68 No. 40.

The causeway is almost entirely abandoned, the pavement being for the most part broken up and more difficult than the muddy tracks through the forest. In dry weather a good temporary road might be made with little labour, the line of the causeway being still clear of forest. This line opposes fewer obstacles than any other to the construction of a road for wheeled conveyances between Shahrud and Mazandaran; but it is very circuitous. Kurd Mahalla contains 350 to 400 houses, and is situated half a mile off left of high road in dense forest, which extends to the shore 4 or 5 miles distant.

The rivers be tween Khuraraabad and Karmanshah, though by no means to be compared (in the summer) with the broad and rapid streams of India, are still of no contemptible breadth and size, affording the first water for the purposes of irrigation.

An old stone-tower at Burj-Gulwarda on a slight eminence ; round foot of hillock are three wells with a fair supply of good water, 3 feet below the surface. Road passes for first 9 miles up gravelly daman, west by south. The track here was badly mark ed. At 9 miles it enters the Ahingaran range of hills which has hitherto blocked the view on right front, and for about miles goes up stony nala bottom, when it crosses low and open kotal (4,320 feet). The rise from entrance to hills to the kotal is 300 feet. After leaving kotal, road passes over slightly undulating, descending ground among hills until a sort of outer kotal is reached, when road drops rather suddenly into the Awaz plain. This is the only steepish part of road, and it would have to be made a little, in order to take guns over. The drop is however not more than 100 feet. Awaz village consists of an old ruined fort with a good cluster of domed houses. Nice karez of water here, Cf. Route No. Ill, stage 9. From Awaz two roads to Birjand, one via Turk and the other via Gask and Eahnish ; the latter is described. Road runs across open plain due west. After about a mile a broad track, leading southwards from the neighbouring village of Gazik, is crossed and also flat dry bed of stream, which drains away through the hills to the south-east and gets lost in the Dasht-i-Na-Umed. Road then passes up valley in among low undulat ing hillocks. At 6 miles an old tiaoz is reached (no water), where a road branches to left, leading to Taughan and Furk.

Valley of the Fakh End, which comprises the Sanikhana district, is a high level valley, being bordered on the north by the high mass of hills culminating at the north-west end in the Shahz Koh peak, height 9,201 feet and further east the Kuh-i-Safed, height 9,258 feet.^ Its southern boundary is formed by range of hills forming the north watershed of the Birjand river and its culminating point is 7,996 feet. &gt; Birjand, height 4,540 feet. Direct road from Eahnish crosses valley and then gops over a few low spurs for 2 miles and emerges into the dasht of valley of Birjand river across which plain it runs direct to Birjand, situated on the banks of the stream just near the end of ridge of low clay hills which run curiously all down the fcentre of the valley. 10 Biejand 4,740'. 14 176J Birjand is a poor looking town with no trees.

From here road to Dastgird and Khur described by Stewart, branches off to W. Passing Khusp road at 5j- miles, crosses river-bed by a very easy crossing and runs along right bank to Fidishk, a moderate village with good karez water, the last inhabited place in this direction towards the Dasht-i-Lut. Road runs from Fidishk, down right bank of Khusp river which along here has a small running stream in it, the same as the Fidishk water, slightly brsckish. After run ning about 2 miles, some low hills which appear to close the Khusp valley, come down to the river- bank. Road passes through these, which are here merely undulating ground. After about a mile of this, road emerges on to dasht of usual type covered with wormwood bushes: then leaves neighbourhood of river-bed and turns more to the west. At 7^ miles a dry haoz and another at llf. From here road bends more to south and makes for hills on the opposite side of the dasht. At 13J- miles dry bed of the Khusp river is crossed and road keeps on its left bank for a little way; about here a great quantity of firewood can be obtained. Road goes on steadily south-west making for Nalinao which can now be seen under the hills. Height of lowest point of valley is 3,360 feet. The road ascends about 200 feet up a gentle daman and reaches Nalinao at 25 miles. There is one fair spring here of slightly brackish water, and one or two oozing springs ; they fall into a pond some 20 yards in diameter. The present supply would do for one infantry regiment. Small flocks of sheep are pastured in the neighbourhood. No good firewood in the immediate vicinity. At Sar-i-chah, which appears to be from 20 to 25 miles from here along the hills to the east-south- east, there is said to be plenty of \vater and good 'abadi.' It was from that point that Khanikoff started on his march across the Lut to Khabis. I was told that nowadays there is no water whatever on that road. If caravans cross there, which they only do in the winter, they have to carry water with them for the whole inarch.109 No. 70— conid. Ghurian to Karman, via Yazdan, fyc. No. of Btagc.

The road for the first 3 mile runs west along the foot of the ridge of hills, it then enters a nala-hed, up which it conti nues^ the direction being generally west. The nala is wide and the bed easj-going and having many tamarisk-trees in it. At 6-5 miles a kotal is reached (height 3,940 feet), the watershed between the north and south slopes of the range. The road up it is very gentle and the kotal very low (350 feet above Nalinao), from here the road runs over undulating ground in a south west and south-south-west direction to about 9 miles, where it enters another broad nala-bed, down which it runs west-south-west till Garm ab is reached at 13 miles. Here there is an old tower situated on highish ground, well above the nala-bed, the ground about being undulating. There is a hot spring here, having its source close under the tower on the high ground. tS spring has a good steady flow of water much more than at Nalinao. The temperature of the issuing water is 107° (Fahrenheit). When cooled it is drinkable, but rather salt and a trifle sulphury and not nice. There is plenty of firewood tama risk about. The road to-day was quite passable for guns ; like all roads, used only by baggage animals, it would want smoothing here and there, when cut by water-courses, but there is nothing that could not be done as the guns went along, Garmab may be looked on as situated on the edge of the real Dasht-i-Lut. One has a very exten sive view from here from south-east round to west. Far away to the south-east a high conical peak, the name of which was given me as Shahkuh, was visible. This lies a little to the south of the route from Neh via Sar-i-chah to Birjand traversed by Khanikoff. To the south were several lower hills, apparently detached, which lie in the middle of the Lut near Khani koff 's road across it. To the south-west appear ed the double-peaked Kuh-i-Murghab which lies almost on the other side of the Lut, not very far from Karman. Directly west was visible the high-peaked Kuh-i-Naiband, at the foot of which Naiband, our next halting-place, is situated.110 No. 70— contd. Giiurian to Karman, via No. of Btage. Names of stages.

The Lut was very different from what I expected. It is by no means a flat, open plain. The road at first went across ground which consisted partly of dasht with wormwood and tagaz bushes, but was mostly undulating ground of black gravel with low ridgy black hillocks and rocks cropping up, some reaching to a height of 100 feet or more. As we got further on the patches of dasht got fewer, and it was almost entirely the undulating gravelly ground. At 5 p.m ., having gone about 11*5 miles, we reached the Birjand river-bed, running a very winding course. For about a mile where we struck it, the whole bed was full of salt. There was no running water in it, though some very briny water was standing among the salt deposit. The river runs away to the south and eventually loses itself in the Lut. Passing on at 6-20 p.m., having come about 16 miles, we reached some big, natural, upstanding rocks which lie a little south of the road and which form a good land mark. These are known as Kala-i-Zargar. Here we halted for a couple of hours to feed the animals and rest them. We started again at h-15 p.m ., and going steadily over the same style of ground, reached Shand Ali Reza at 1 a.m., 32 miles. This is the point where Colonel Stewart's route from Khur to 'Naiband joined mine. Here there are two or three water holes in the dry bed of a stream. These hold water in the spring and early summer, but were quite dry now. This is the lowest point in this part of the Lut, having a height of 2,370 feet. At about 37 miles we passed the salt-bed of a stream, shortly after which we began to rise slowly up the daman of the Naiband hill. We reached Naiband village at 7-30 a.m. on the morning of the 12th October. Naiband has been well described by Colonel Stewart in his report. The village is prettily nestled in among low ridgy spurs to the south-east of the big hill. Palm trees all about the village and springs of good water. The Naiband peak forms the northern end of a long ridge of hills which run north and south, ending near the Kuh-i-Murg- hab on south. The peak must be over 7,000 feet high and is a splendid landmark.Ill No. KQ-^-contd, Ghurian to Karman, via Yazdan, 8fc, No. of stage. Names of stages. D istances in miles. R bmakks.

At Naiband meet Karman-Mashad road which runs north from Naiband across the Lut to Bushru- yeh. Eoad from Garmab to Naiband waa a very fairly marked one. For guns it would probably be necessary here and there to pick a better track. No loose sand whatever on this part of the Lut though further east on the track from Neh to Kai man there is said to be a good deal of sand. Road at first crosses a lot of little water-courses and, after going south-west for about 1 mile, strikes a bigger nala, up which it goes for about I2 miles. It then turns to left over spur sepa- rating this nala from another. Road is steepish here both up and down, though the height is very little. Getting into this nala it descends it tor about 1 mile and then goes np another branch of same nala running pretty nearly south. It continues up this among moderate hills till the kotal, an almost imperceptible one (height 3,720 feet), is reached at IOJ miles from Naiband. This is the range of hills before alluded to as running south from the Naiband peak. E^ad is very well marked, the only difficult place tor guns in its present state is the steep place before mentioned. This might be turned at the expense of a longer route by going outside the low hills and up into the main kotal nala at once. There is no drop on the western side of the kotal. Faraway to the south-south-west the Darband peak was visible. Road runs along over hard dasht on a bearing of about 200° for about 4 miles from kotal when it gets in between two low hills. At 16 miles reached Haoz-i-Khan, a dry haoz, which nowadays never contains water. Some miles beyond Haoz-i-Khan road enters curious hilly ground, consisting of low flat-top ped, scarped hills, the road frequently running up a nala bed between walls as it were. These nala-'beds are always wide and open. At 34J miles the road reaches a big hill. One approach es this hill across an open plain and it looks like a wall of rock. The road enters it in what appears to a nala bed, f to 1 mile wide, from113 No. 70— conkl, Ghurian to Karman, via Yazdan, 8fc, No. of ftage. Names of stages. D istakcbs in miles. Interme diate.

It is a very curious place. Bed, up which road went, gradually narrowed, cliffs approaching one another more closely. Passed an impercep tible watershed, and then descended through a similar nala to Chehel Pai. Here three little stone huts for travellers, a dry haoz and the well, all situated in the bed of this curious nala, here per haps half mile wide, with cliffs on either hand. The road the whole way was very well marked,, being greatly used by pilgrims. There- were generally five or six well-worn tracks abreast. From the Naiband kotal to Ohehel Pai it is per fectly easy for guns. Well at Chehel Pai is 87 feet below surface. It is approached by an inclined tunnel, down which steps are cut in the rock, more or less rough. It is very troublesome to water animals from, as the- water has to be carried up these steps. Watering 36 mules aud 6 horses about dried it out, but it filled up fairly well again in about six hours. The Lut on this western side of the Naiband range appears to be much more hilly than to the east ward, ridges of detached hills being scattered oyer it, with next to no vegetation. All supplies^, etc., must be carried. For 3 miles road continues down the same nala-bed with cliffs on either side; then emerges into open plain, and makes straight across for Darband hill on the other side. It is a most desolate ' dasht of sandy gravel; surface a little soft at first, but firm enough below : not a bush to be seen. Small stone pillars built by side of road about every 2 miles, presumably to mark it. At 22 mues reach foot of hills and road goes up for 1 mile along a nala-bed among low outer hills to Dar band. ^ . Here is a newly-built caravansarai, a very small spring of water and some date trees. A post ot a couple of men is kept here. . Road good for guns all the way, though a htt e heavy here and there. ^ , In the valley passed over in this inarch lowest point was 1,930 feet. This valley drains eastwards113 15 No. 70—contd.

This would give a probable height to the point (where Khanikoff crossed the same drainage) of perhaps 1,700 feet, which ia probably the lowest point of the Lut between Birjand and Karman. From there the Lut prob ably slopes gently away towards Sistau which has a height of 1,300 to 1,400 feet. 18 Yusufabad 3,670'. 29 383 Road runs north-west from sarai for about 1 mil© till it gets on edge of main nala coming out of the hills. It then turns west-souih-west up nala and runs along high right bank of nala going up and down across the side streams. In one place there is a nasty drop into a nala of about 30 feet, good enough for baggage ani mals, but guns could not pass in its present state; altogether this part of the road would want looking at. The road and nala gradual ly trend south, and after about 4 miles road descends into the wide nala-bed and runs up it. At 12J miles a large nala comes in ou right hand (as one goes up the road), and about J mile up this, is ruined sarai of Chah Kura There are two or three wells here a little abovo the sarai. They appear to be old harez pits, but the harez does not run at present. They held plenty of water. The sarai and wells are off the main road whicb continues up the main nala. After .leaving the junction of the nalas, road continues up main nala and soon enters some clay hills, where track is very narrow at the bottom, barely wide enough for a gun carriage to pass in its present state. At 15 miles an easy kotal among these clay hills is passed and the road then descends into a plain surrounded by hills mainly of a fantastic character; very steep clay ridges, with walls of limestone perched on top. Passing through this plain at 28 miles, small village of Karimabad is reached. Good supply of water from a karez, and at 29 miles the small village of Yusufabad. There is extraordinarily little vegetation anywheio about this country, the very scantiest camel graz ing, except in the immediate vicinity of viilagea, where camel-thorn grows freely, Yusufabad is in the Rawar district, which consists of a large plain, lying north and south, with high hills to west, the highest being 11 ,060 feet114 No. 70— contd. Ghurian to Karman, vid Yazdan, fyc. No. of stage. D istances in miles. R emaeks. Names of stages. Interme diate. Total. high. The hills to the east are more detached. The drainage of the valley runs away through the hills to the east into the Lnt. There are scattered small villages about in the valley and not much cultivation, except in neighhourhood of Rawar and the villages. Yusufahad is watered by a large fcarez which comes from western hills, and which fills a large tank near village. From this tank it is run off, as required, to the various small villages in neighhourhood. 19 R awar 3,730'. 5 00 00 CO Road runs straight across plain, passing two or three villages, none very big. Encamped on the north edge of village, which is a long strip of walled gardens and houses mixed, some 2 miles long. Head-quarters of district and is said to contain 1,500 houses. Supplies very dear as they had a famine the previous year. 20 Hioz-i-PisJ ... 4,420'. 16 404 So called because it is 5 farsakhs from Rawar. Road runs up Rawar valley, passing at first through a lot of ground cut up by Icarez holes. At 2J miles village of Khairabad ; at miles road, continuing in a south-east direction, crosses a nala with low banks and then continues up bank of same nala, sometimes running up its gravelly bed and some times on its bank. It runs on in direction of curious mass of hill, a flat-top, detached hill, with precipitous sides, which appears to block up the end of the valley. Along this part of road there are low hills close on left,'valley on right being of varying width of from 2 to 5 miles. At Haoz-i-Panj is a smali building intended as a sarai, and a not very big covered liaoz 9 full of rather bad smelling watei^ Fortunately this year, apparently on account o the plentiful spring rains, there was good running water in the stream close by. This is, howevei, unusual. In very dry years the haoz water even is uncertain. 21 ABID 6,080'. 13 417 Road runs up valley, still in the direction of squaie- topped hill, over dasht. After about 7a nules i drops into the bed of nala, banks having this ime become some 30 or 40 feet high.

Guns, however, would have to stick to the bed. It would be a heavy bit of work for them in any case. After a tiresome march of 13 miles Abid or Ab-i-Bid is reached. The ascent is very considerable all the way, amounting to 1,660 feet. Here there is a sarai apparently only partly built. There is a large willow-tree on the rising ground, and from all over this bit of ground near the tree water oozes out, making little running streams. On the whole, there is a very fair supply, more than ample for all caravans, and the water itself is good. The dasht was much more like the Afghan ones, having vegetation on it. 22 Haeuz 6,560'. 14 401 Road runs from Abid south-east, still up same vallev, with high hill to south, for about 1 mile, where it passes oyer a gentle watershed, and, leaving the Eawar drainage, descends another narrow valley still in the same direction. At about 3| miles end of this valley is reached and road emerges into a sort of basin among high hills which receives drainage in various directions, the result ing drainage running apparently away north-east into the Lut. At this point road turns sharp to right and runs due south. At 4| miles low kotal over some day hills is passed and about 5| miles a second higher and stonier kotal is crossed and the road drops down on to Sar-i-Apsh in the bed of a stream which makes its way into the aforesaid basin. Sar-i-Apsh is on the edge of the stream with big hills at its back. It is a small village. There is a nice running mountain stream, the first real running stream seen since the Hari Rud. Road continues on south up valley of this stream which is walled in by a ridge of hills on west, but is pretty open and undulating to east. Patches of cultivation and little hamlets at inter vals all along the stream. At 14 miles village of Haruz is reached, situated on the stream. It is only a small village, but there is a caravansarai. No doubt a fair amount of supplies could be col lected in the valley. There is a moderate amount of tamarisk along the stream. The road was good enough for guns with the exception of the116 No. 70— concld, G hurt an io K arm an, vid Yazdan, fyc. No. of stage. Names of stages. 23 Sae-i-Asia 5,850'. 24 Kaeman 5,680'.

Cold very great and firewood is scarce. Last year a kafila was snowed up here for 20 days. There is a direct road from here to Khabis which runs up the Haruz valley. There is also a direct road from here vid Sar-i-Apsh across the Lut desert passing south of the Kuhi- Murghab to Sar-i-Chah and Khusp. There is no water on it between Sar-i-Chah and Sar-i-Apsh. This road is only used by kafilas in spring. Road leaves ''the main and ascends steadily a south among lowish hills. After stream at Haruz road to 3 miles winding a kotal is reached, road up beinsr good. This is a good deal the highest point yet reached on the march, being 7,650 feet high. Fine high peak standing to the west of kotal. Road then des cends pretty rapidly to the S. E. for a mile, till it gets into a main nala, where there is a small hamlet with a little cultivation and a running stream. It then descends bed of this stream with high hills on either hand till 11 miles, where it emerges into a very wide valley running N. W. and S. E. dotted with villages. It runs over the daman of the hills to the good-siz^d village of Hut (17J miles). Passing this 3| miles further on in same direction reached Sar-i-Asia, a small village with good caravansarai. Sar-i-Asia is on the N', edge of the wide and open valley which runs from Karman vid Zarand to Yazd. The road runs from Sar-i-Asia to S. E. between some detached hills which are left to south and the main range to north of the valley. Then turning a little more south it runs straight to the city. About half-way there is a curious rocky hill to right, with the remains of fortifications running all up the side. This road, after pass ing through a quantity of ruins, enters the north gate of the city.117 No. 71. Gulpaigan to Burtjjiud, via Khonsa Authority — B ell. No. D istances in' miles. of stage.

Twenty years ago, the whole country was mostly nnder water and covered with reeds and swamps full of fish and fowl. Now these have all dried up, and the ground is being brought under cultivation, and men were to be seen ploughing with either a camel or a pony in all directions. This soath^ west corner of the Yamut country is far the most thickly populated. ^ Obahs were dotted all about. The Jafarbais in Persian territory are said to number 3,000 families. Of these about 500 are Charwas and are located on the right bank of the Gurgan within a radius of 8 or 10 miles from the river. Of the Chumurs some 50 families are said to have settled at a place lately left dry by the sea called Tazahabad, about three farsakhs to the north of Giumish Tapa, but with that exception all the remainder are either at Griumish lapa or to the south of it, between the Gurgan and the sea. The chief Obahs are Khoja Nafas at the present mouth of the Gurgan and Bash Wskha at the mouth of the old bed of that river 5 or 6 miles further south of it. Each of these places numbers from 600 to 800 families. None of the Jafarbais extend east of the telegraph line. The Jafarbais are large camel, sheep, and cattle owners. The sheep and wool all go to Russia, and also some cattle. Camels and also buffaloes are bought, it is said, by Turks from Azarbaijan who come here every year to purchase them. Formerly the river Gurgan found its way to the sea along what is marked in the map (Sheet No. 84) as the old bed. This was left high and dry, and some forty years ago the Persians made an attempt to turn the river back into the old bed by building a ' band ' across the stream at the place where we are now encamped. The site of i-n then built to guard the dam is stilly visible. The first flood, however, though carried the band' away, and no attempts to turn the river have been made since. The old119 No. 72— concld. G iumish T apa to A strabad. Names of stages. D istances in miles. Interme diate. E emaeks. Total. A stuabad 12 25 bed is now some 10 or 15 feet above the present level of the water. After that the river conti nued to flow in two channels, one to Khoja Nafas and one to Gumish Tapa, till within the last eight years when the latter branch ran dry. There are three bridges now across the river, one at Ak Kala, Persian fort garrisoned by 300 Saihazes and 20 gunners, one at this village and one at Obah-i-Haji Muhammad Khan, about four miles further down. The two latter are both slight wooden structures built on high piles and stretch across on a level with the banks. They were erected by a carpenter from Astrakhan at a cost, it is said, of only 250 tumans each. The piles are said to have been 10J zars (3| feet= 1 zar) in length, of which 4j are sunk in the bed of the river and 6 are above it, and the bridge is said to be 55 zars in length and 4 (14 feet) in breadth. The river here runs between perpendicular banks some 20 feet below the level of the plain. There is nothing to mark the course of the river, and so sudden is the drop that a hundred yards otf no one could tell that the river was near. Pass the little bridge over the Karasu, 5 miles out, which river forms the limit of Tamut territory in this direction. The river, however, could hardly be dignified by that name, as the channel was dry and mostly overgrown with grass and only some 15 feet broad and 4 or 5 feet deep. Beyond, pass through level plain, mostly covered with reeds and quite uncultivated for another 4 miles, and then pass the villages of Kala and Zangi Mahalla to Astrabad. The difference between Astrabad and Mashad at this time of the year is very great. Here orange and lime trees are in full fruit, and the oaks have not ygt shed their leaves. The sun by day is hot at times, and yet, only a few hundred feet up, the hillsides are all covered with snow. The country is wonderfully green all round, and though the^ town is deep in mud, still the temperature is pleasant, and were it not for the mud the place might be a pleasant winter resi dence.120 No. 73.

General Summary of Itoute, From the foot of mount Alwand a grassy plain extends to the north, the group of hills called the Buwata Dagh, being the most conspicuous point in that direction. About 45 miles from Hamadan the road crosses the lower western spurs of that group, which appears to consist of a central map of rocky mountains rising 2,000 to 3,000' above the plain, and surrounded at a distance of, at the point traversed, about 6 to 8 miles, by a belt of low hills; the range appears to be continued to the north-west in a chain of rocky hills, which is probably the same afterwards crossed at Bijar, further to the west; the most prominent peak ob served from the Buwata Dagh in this direction may probably be identified as the Kuh-i-Znghal pointed out from Bijar to the south-east of that place. From the Buwata Dagh an undulating grassy plain is crossed to the foot of the Paighambar Dagh, a great map of round-topped grassy hills, crowned by a central rocky citadel: inside the outer ring of hills and surrounding this citadel is a belt of richly cultivated land, with many villages. Crossing the outer circle of hills to the north of Bulam Haji, the road skirts the valley, down which the Teheran-Tabriz road and telegraph passes, keeping high above it, and to the south, until they meet at Zindjan. Throughout the whole distance villages are numerous and water in streams and springs plentiful ; corn is fairly plentiful, especially in the rich country surround ing the Paighambar Dagh. A considerable amount of coarse grass grows on the hill sides and undulating country.^ With the exception of the fruit-trees in gardens, and a few groves of willow and poplar near the streams, firewood does not exist ; cowdung is the chief fuel used by the inhabitants. Large caravans of pilgrims from Tabriz and the neighbourhood of Tiflis were met; they were nearly all mounted on excellent strong ponies in good condition. The road is good throughout and practicable for wheels, with the exception of a few hundred yards in place which might easily be made so.131 No. 75. H asan K uli to K ara K ala. Authority — U nknown.

This place afterwards suffered from famine. Two farsaJcls. ^ Shortly after leaving Alui pass through Hasni, a caravansarai in a ruinous state, and a few houses, fields and gardens. Deh Hak is a small town at the north-west end of the valley, nestling between barren limestone hills. It looks more important than it really is, as nearly 1,000 dwellings of sun-dried brick, presenting a compact appearance, are situated amongst vine yards and fruit-trees. A few stable-like 41 inns.' Population about 8,000. Principal crops, wheat and barley. Distance from Chalisja, 8 farsakhs.. From Deh Hak there is a direct road to Gulpaigan as follows : Khundab, Ifarsakh ; three forts and numerous hovels; thence 31 farsakhs north west, the Madar-i-Shah caravansarai. About 2 miles beyond is a narrow pass between rugged hills. Duah, about 6 miles from the pass, ^con- tams a number of new huts and two old caravan- sarais. From Duah the road passes into the fine plain of Gulpai^an farsakhs by the wide bed of a torrent, the same on which there is a bund near the Madar-i-Shah caravansarai. A few miles east of Gulpaigan is the large village of ICukh, with a poor caravansarai. From Kukh the road crosses the hills to Kumi. The first 3 miles of it lies in a cultivated plain as tar as a well-built bridge. Here the road leaves the cultivated part and ascends to the pass above.133 No. Ift—confd. Isfahan to Gulpaigan.

Valley wide and apparently destitute of villages, but flocks of sheep are met with. The little town occupies one of the higher undulations of the valley. Its mud-built houses rise above each other, and there are some two-storied brick buildings on a rocky bluff at the eastern end. A few shops. Popula tion about 2,000. Water from Jcanats, collected in a reservoir half a mile from the village. V mere track leads in 10 miles to two or three villages; it then enters a mass of confused low hills, the undulations becoming very steep and rocky as it nears Khonsa. In front rises the high barren chain of El Ahwaz, Behind and to the north ward the ranges are low and of the usual sterile, monotonous kind. Tin and copper are found amongst these hills. The valley is barren and dreary enough; but from a rising piece of ground, Gulpaigan and its neighbourhood can be seen 10 miles to the northward. The undula tions get steeper, and the rough way leads at times over the bare rock ; in places clear little streams issue from the soil and herbs and flowers spring up. The sudden change from this barrenness to exuberant fertility is most rerrarkable, for Khonsa and its superb valley, overflowing with rich foliage and cultivation, lies at the traveller's feet on emerging from the rocky way. This beautiful valley, extending^ north and south for 6 or 7 miles, is often very narrow, and in some parts merely a gorge ; a chain of hills rises almost at once from the cultivation on the western side, and inconsiderable hills running into each other, without the slightest semblance of vegetation, from the boundary to the eastward. A break neck path leads to a large and neglected burial- ground, and into Khonsa through a dirty and poor-looking bazaar. Cf. Route No. 80, stage 5.

Up to Dumbina, presents no difficulties, being nearly level and across open country ; beyond Dumbina and up to Chaman-i-Sultan, it crosses a hilly tract, but could be traversed by wheeled carriages ; bullock-carts were seen in use about Chahil Khuni, west of Dumbina : from Aligudar the route taken through the Tang-i-Darband is in that part rough and stony, and crosses and recrosses the stream several times ; from Darband to Burujird the country is again open and presents no difficulties. Between Burujird and Hamadan the road is hilly, but the only difficult part lies about the villages of Jalpahan and Aliabad, where it is rough and .stony, but could no doubt be made practicable for wheels. Up to Dumbina, villages are common and corn fairly abundant; from Dumbina to Aligudar the country is hilly, but the valleys appear very fertile, and a considerable amount of corn is grown along the course of the many streams, by which that tract is watered. Ali gudar itself lies in a large and rich valley, with many villages to the south and south-west, and much cultivation. Darband, at the west outlet of the defile of that name, has a large area of corn land ; from thence to Burujird the road lies down a rich valley with many vil lages and much cultivation ; between Burujird and Hamadan villages are numerous, and the valley, m which Kalilabadis situated, appears to grow a very large amount of fine corn. Fire wood is everywhere scarce, the hills yielding a scanty supply of brushwood. 'Kah,' the broken stalk of the corn, is the common fodder for horses 5 coarse grass grows in parts and U plentiful in the valley of Burujird. Water is met with throughout in streams, springs and Tcanats. Horses, ponies, mules and donkeys are found in all the villages, but nowhere in large numbers ; pack bullocks were noticed in use about Burujird j in that city no doubt a considerable number of transport animals might be collected.1SS No. 78.

After crossing various low ridges for some 5 or 6 miles, the road eventu ally leads down on to the level of the Daragaz plain at a place called Ispain, and some 4 miles beyond that lies Chapashlu surrounded with gardens and vineyards. ^ Chapashlu contains some 400 families of Turks and Kurds. Turki is the language spoken by all. . . . The village possesses some H5 ploughs of irrigated land and 200 ploughs of unirrigated.

The Baluk is terminated, and the head, of the Daragaz valley is closed by a gorge with precipitous rocks rising two and three hundred feet on either side at the entrance and rising higher and higher further on. This gorge is said to be quite impassable. Two roads lead, out of the valley. The one to the south of the gorge to Durbadam. The second leads to the north of the gorge to Sham- khal and thence along the ^ skabad-Kuchan high road to the frontier at Bajgirha. The respective distances are said to be 5 farsakhs to Durbadam, but with a less difficult road, and 3| farsakhs to Bajgirha. By the latter it takes about seven hours to do those 3| farsakhs, so bad is the road. Leaving the valley just to the right of the gorge, commence with an ascent of 1,275 feet according to the aneroid, straight up the side of a steep hill. Thence up and down, in and out of various ravines along the southern slope of the hills with the Durungar river gorge below on the left the whole way. At about the 7th mile we got to the foot of the Kotal-i-Chubast, the crowning difficulty of the whole march. Here necessary to climb up the almost perpendicular face of a hill for some 400 feet and then a passage along a narrow rocky ledge with a steep declivity below and nasty rocks jutting out above every here and there, just so placed as to catch the loads on the mules and send the animals over the edge. It took an hour and a half to get the few Abdari and other mules over this pass, and at one place felts had to be laid down to get the horses or mules up at all. Beyond this there is an easy and gradual descent to Shamkhal, where the first water was reached at about the 11th mile. The muleteers suffer greatly from the want of water on the road, and any one doing this march should be careful to carry water with him. The baggage mules, which started at 5 a.m ,, did not reach Bajgirha till 4 p.m ., and many of them then with cut and bruised legs and heads from their frequent falls on the rocks. Shamkhal is a small village just at the head of a second precipitous gorge which runs down and joins the main Durungar stream gorge. About a mile beyond is the high road at Mihman- khana.

It is called the guest house, but is not used as such. There was not a soul in it, and the only use apparently it was put to was that of a store-house by the Persian Customs officer for the storage of a number of bales of wool, taken over as payment in kind of the taxes due from a large consignment on its way from Sabzawar to Askabad. Some 2 miles beyond or to the north of the Mihman- khuna rench the village of Bajgirha-i-Irani, as it is called to distinguish it from the Ptussian post called Bajgirha-i-Urusi on the opposite side of the frontier.

Thence road goes on west-south-west, being com manded on the left by bold heights ; then across numerous ravines and valleys, in one of which is village of Churm (50 houses). Road then ascends for a short distance a low spur, and descends by a bad stony path to another stream, which, unit ing with that from Ohurm, goes on to Archin- gan. From this road crosses to valleys, in latter of which is village of Sanai, a mile up the glen, consisting of 100 houses. Eoad now goes down this valley for ^ of a mile ; then over a spur for | a mile, and down another valley for f of a mile, from which it ascends verv steeply over earth-covered slopes for | of a mile to east of the Ahdahi Pass. Prom thence the descent to Tgdalik is very steep and commanded by an iso lated hill, with scarped sides, that overhangs river and affords a splendid site for a fort. From Tgdalik, road ascends to the Gardan-i-Tutlak in about 1 hour by an easy gradient, except the last 200 yards which are very steep. Thence over 2 small valleys, first named Tutak to mouth of Darband-i-Khakistar. Road goes up this pass for nearly an hour over huge boulders, passing by positions of great strength, particularly at a part 30 wide, where a wall 15' high has been erected across, and where towers on both sides command the entrance. Beyond the wall a succession of 4 or 5 little glens are passed, filled with trees and connected with each other by narrow defiles. After leaving this, this defile opens out a little though still crowned by lofty cliffs, as far as a place called ' Chahar-Rah,' where 2 valleys meet and whence a road goes over the hills to Kardih and thence to Mashad. From this there is a steep ascent to the top of the Kotal-i-Lain, fol lowed by aii equally bad descent to the village of Lam, containing 50 houses of Kurds. From this, road ascends at first by an easy though stony gradient, but afterwards getting worse qnd worse, till the top of Kotal-i-Tn-gaun^r^ched by very steep, stony, zigzag track.

For 20 minutes road is very difficult, being impeded by boulders and shut in by overhanging cliffs. Defile then opens, and is easier for next 10 minutes, after which open valley begins ; after going down this for^ 5 minutes, road leaves stream, to wind again amid desolate glens and narrow defiles, till it em erges into the plain. Thence after ascending and descending over several spurs, into different small glens, the five valleys of Zangalani are reached. River here 30' broad and 3' deep is crossed by a ford, the current of which would be impassable after rain. About half a mile above the ford, road is joined by the one over the hills; thence it goes over open hills, ascending easily for f of an hour, and then descends over the same sort of country for one hour and a quarter, to the deserted fort of Sain. Then on past small fort of Kumach Khur on a hill through low, deserted valleys, with good soil and water to a low ridge, whence a level road leads to Muhammadabad in one hour and three-quarters from Sain. 4 M ian K uh ... 17 74 From Muhammadabad road goes out to south-west and in a mile passes old site of chief village of the Khanate. It then passes between low hills for 2 miles, when it passes village of Pain-Kala, ^ a mile on right, and 2 miles further comes to village of Khalk Vardi, that of Chapishli being about 1 mile further on to left front. One mile to right of Pain-Kala is Kala-i-Abbas, and 1 mile still further to right is Sadabad, kotal be ing 3 miles further off still on the right. From Khalk Vardi the road goes over an open undulat ing plain for 4 miles to village of Kala-i-Mina, 1 mile off the regular road to left. From this the ascent of Allahu Akbar Pass is made. The ascent is a little over 3 miles, and takes 1^ hours to accomplish. The whole road is easy, and except for a few short bits, where it could easily be improved, is practicable for artillery. Before descending, road passes over a low neck of the ridge, after which it goes down easy, but rather stony, to a curious series of little reeky projections, which rise straight out of the ground to a height176 No. §v~~contcL Kalat-i-Nadiri to Bujnurb, via, Daragaz.

These make road very difficult, and the interstices would have to he filled up with earth before artillery could get over. From this, road descends pretty steeply and much encumbered by stones. Last part is es pecially bad, going through a narrow defile with cliffs close on either hand, and the road lying over masses of sheet rock, making it quite im practicable for artillery in its present state. Thence road continuts alongside the stream, ascending imperceptibly to the south of Mian Kuh, about one mile on. From Mian Kuh road goes along valley, gradually ascending for 3 miles to small hamlet, just be yond which a defile is entered, where another stream joins from left, up which there is a road to Mashad. It then turns to right up a little valley, and presently commences ascent of the Kotal-i-Maidan-i-Khuni. Ascent is very easy, not taking more than half an hour, into an undu lating plain covered with grass ; level for f of a mile. Descent is easy at first, but gradually be comes worse, till towards end it is very rocky, steep and difficult, and would have to be much improved for artillery. The whole descent is about miles to village of Tawarikh, having a good deal of cultivation and plenty of water. From this there are two roads, 1 down the defile, the other over the hill. The latter is tl»e shortest and is quite easy the whole way to Mairi, a village of 100 houses and having a good water-supply. Thence road goes down a ravine for 2 miles to village of K^ala Agha Sayad, when the main valley of Kuchan is reached, and from which the town of Kuchan is reached in 6 miles over a fine open undulating valley. 2,000 houses of Kurds.

B emarks, Kahiran KHCTBUK 21 Sena The following is Plowden's itinerary from Kami- ran:— The road from Katmran to Khuruk continues to follow a northerly direction ; in some parts it is excellent going, and is wide enough for two carriages to pass; in other parts it is a mere bridle path, and one has to tread one's way over steep and stony ground. For the first 6 or 7 miles the road traverses a mountainous and very uninteresting country. The hills, though lofty, are hare and brown ; there are no trees, no vil*' lages, and no cultivation. The prospect is more pleasing as one approaches the village and valley of Sururi (Saora F), where there is a good deal of cultivation. The Sururi valley continues as far as a stream called Cham-i-Gahwara. (This is evidently the river called by Webb, Ghoru). From this stream the road gradually ascends, and at length after a somewhat steep climb crosses a considerable elevation, which is said to be a portion of the Shah a range. The descent on the other side is longer and more gradual, but the general character of the country is as unin teresting as before. The road passes for about 7 miles through a sparsely cultivated valley flanked by bare treeless hills, until it reaches the next village of Khuruk, which contains about 40 well-built houses and furnished ample sup plies. There appeared to be very little traffic between Sena and Karmanshah, but there is said to be more in the spring, after the first melting of the snow. The road, though a mere footpath, for a great part of the way seemed quite good enough for all the purposes for which it is used. There is plenty of water even at the driest season of the year. There is very little to be said about the road from Khuruk) to Sena; its characteriptics are much the same as those which distinguished the last 7 miles of the former stage. The road passes through a thinly cultivated valley shut m by lofty hills. Here and there, where water is ob tainable, a Kurdish village, its site marked by poplars or chenar trees, is visible sometimes on the lower slopes of the hills, sometimes perched high up and difficult of access. The produce or the crops about here seemed inferior in quantity and quality to that of the plains of Kanud Mahi- dasht and Karmanshah*187 No. 102.

Here enter into another valley, water shedding east. Cross this valley, and at 15^ miles, at Haisabad, commence a moderate rise for 1| miles to the divide (5,590'). Then along slope of hill for 4 miles to Parispa. The road leads over the Bakarabad divide, but Parispa could be reached by an almost level line from the 5,120' divide, the first come to on the road, by follow ing the watercourses leading eastward beyond the low mud range between it and Parispa, for the latter place is on a river which accepts the Bakar abad watercourse. The detour may, however, bo hardly worth the trouble, and the Bakarabad Kotal is evidently better suited for a main traffic, as be yond are wealthier low-lying valleys. The kotal could be easily cut through or reached at low inclines by^ hugging the mud hillocks to the north. Parispa would seem an obligatory point as from it exists the best line to reach the central plateau. 4 H amilabad 6,200'. 12 85 On leaving the village, cross river (brick and stone bridge).

The country seems deso late, and but few villages are passed. In deep winter, with 3' of snow, perhaps an un favourable impression was gathered. At 6 and 7 miles two low spurs (rtinning south-east and north-west) are passed, and the road then gently descends into, and goes up a valley for 6 miles to low mud kotal.

The whole of this road is frequently used for wheel traffic, but not in paying quantities, as I only saw an average of eight vehicles a day on the Kum-Teheran section, This latter road apparently can be only a failure financially, as it is too elaborate and expensive a concern for such a poor country. Donkeys, seemingly, are exempt from toll and they form 80 per cent, of the transport. The formation of this new road, with its accompanying changes of sarais, &amp;C., have made it desirable to re-write this sec tion of the road. The observant traveller can not fail to be struck by the utter want of popu lation between Kum and Tehran, albeit he is charmed with the green slopes and northern feel in the air.194 No. 104.

Thence it descends by a pretty steep and rocky path to a ruined rohat without water, passing by curiously shaped mountains with mushroom-like tops, whence it descends more gradually over a stony, sloping plain to a very broad clay and sand tract into a thicket of about 3J miles broad. After passing through this,- it goes over a very broad tract of clay, bare of vegetation, overflowed in spring by the rain and melted snow from the mountains, for 7 miles to a haoz with no water.

The village contains now 40 families of Kurds from Firuza, to make room for whom the former residents were turned out and sent elsewhere. Had it not been for this, the Finiza people would have left Kuchan territory altogether, and as it was they were only returned with difficulty. The character of the country has quite changed here.

The slopes of the Takraaran valley are cultivated for rain crops, but the more level bit in the centre, known as the Chul -i-Takmamn, is left for grazing. The whole valley looks very bare at this time of the year, as there is not a sign of anything green about it. Ascend the slopes on the southern side to the village of Chahar Burj at the 5th mile. This is not the Chahar Burj marked on the map, as it lies nearly on the top of the hills to the west of the village of Surazu {vide sheet No. 2). Here first met the Shadenlus. Leaving here on another mile to the top of the hills, a rise from the valley of some 1,100 feet, and thence a steep descent for 3 miles to the village of Hammami, and then down a ravine to the Garmakhan valley below. The river Atrak crossed by a wooden bridge at Garmakhan village, the river running here between high steep banks and being some 25 or 30 feet wide, and 2 or 3 feet in depth. Garmakhan is a small level valley, containing some half dozen villages with a total of about 150 families of Shadanlu Kurds, and is well watered from the Atrak. Temperature at 4 p .M. 76°. Road leads over the low hills to the south-west of the Garkm^khan valley. Thence strike the Bujnurd stream (here some 10 feet broad and 2 feet in depth) and follow the banks of that stream through the hills and emerge on the Bujnurd plain. Bujnurd ^ stands in the centre of a circular valley containing about a dozen villages with fine hills all round and a plentiful supply of water, and the view from the top of the Chief's garden-house is green and pretty. The town of Bujnurd is said to have a population of 10,000 people, the estimate in the Gazetteer of 1,500 houses is nearer the mark. Bujnurd is simply a large open village, with a long bazaar in the centre, but it has no trade to speak of, and the shops are simply sufficient to supply local wants. See Index.207 No. 115.

Nearly 2 miles beyond Darband passed to the east of the village of Kirik, and 2 miles beyond that the village of Aishkhana. Shahabad is a village containing about ICO houses, and is now the head-quarters of the Simalghan* district.

Leading np the level Chaman-i-Bid plain for the first 2 miles cross the watershed at Sangchil at a height of some 200 feet above the spring, and then commence a gradual descent of some 1,000 feet into the Karabil valley. For the first 4 or 5 miles road traverses the northern side of a, plain that sloped away down to the south-east, and finally, drains into Shaghan, the only thing visible to break the monotony of its arid surface being the small teppe or mound of Robat-i-Ashk away in the distance to the south. The road here runs west immediately under the Kurkhud range. To the north of the Kurkhud hill, lay the Kastan spring forming the source of the Fucha stream. About half-way from Chaman-i-Bid a slight descent is come to, and beyond that the plain slopes westwards, finally draining into the Dahana-i-Gurgan near Dasht. This plain is known in its upper part as the Karabil valley. Robat-i-Karabil consists of a small village'of ten houses built near the ruins of an old stone robat. The water-supply is scanty, but there are the ruins of numerous old Jcanats all over the plain, which doubtless could be opened out again, were people and capital available.

Eight miles west of Eobat-i-Karabil, and nine miles east of Dasht, is the little village of Armutli containing five houses, and situated at the foot of the Sarai range which bounds the valley on the south. The Karabil valley gradually narrows, as it goes west, and at Armutli (not Armut Ali) is barely a mile in width, and halfway to Dasht, becomes quite narrow. The road there leaves it and descends through the hills to the south into the Dasht plain. The village of Dasht contains now fifty families of Gandar Turks. These fifty families provide a guard of 25 sowars, who are all armed with Wernd rifles. These 25 sowars are supposed to keep a watch on the road from Sugha, the valley lying to the west of Fucha, and other places, by which the Yamuts cross the Karatigan hills to the north. These hills to the north and north-west of Dasht are wooded on their upper slopes with mazu trees. Below them are sprinkled small junipers, but these end here, and are not to be seen further west. Thermometer at 4 p . m . 64°. A beautiful march down the Dahana-i-Gurgan or the Gurgan defile. Lofty hills on either side wooded to their summits with mazu, a kind of oak, and the valley, which, as a rule, does not exceed 200 yards in width, full of trees of various sorts, all in their autumn tints and more or less covered with moss, lichen and mistletoe. The road is stony in places, and in others, to judge from the holes, it must be very muddy in wet weather. The jungle is so dense that nothing but a pack animal could get through, and a regular road would have to be cut through the wood before it could be made passable for wheels. Laden camels must have difficulty in getting through. The descent is gradual, but about 1,100 feet in the 11 miles.

The village of Ishaki lies away np in the hills to the south and is not visible from the road. It contains some twenty families of Turks. Sup plies procurable. The road continues on down the defile through thick wood. The trees on the hill-side are of fair but not of great size, but the oaks in the valley rise to a height in places of 100 and 120 feet with a circumference of 14 or 15 feet at the base. In addition to the oaks there are species of beeches and sycamores and a dozen other kinds of trees, and the glades are full of brambles, ferns and bracken. Some 4 miles below Ishaki the defile gradually widens, and the narrow pass may be said to end there. At about the 5th mile the road passes through an old cemetery said to have belonged to the Gareli Turks, the ancient inhab itants of the country before the Kurds arrived. Some 2 miles beyond the cemetery is the first Goklan Turkoman Obah or village, consisting of some 30 Kibitkas or Alachiks, as they are here called. Beyond this the hills on either side widen out and decrease in height, and one passes through an open grassy valley with wooded hills on either side, those on the south being rather more wood ed than the northern ones. The stream flowing through the Dahana-i-Ourgaa is not the main Gurgan river but only an affluent called Ab-i-Dahana which joins the Gurgan river at Aji Kaushan near Daragaz, some 8 or 9 miles to the west by north of Ohakur. The main stream is said to take its rise from a spring called Yali Chashma at the foot of the Guli Dagh ran^e. The Ab-i-Dahana dries up shortly after leaving the first Goklan Obah and the bed of the stream is dry at Shaghal Tapa. Another little stream from the hills to the south supplies the latter place with water. Lower down springs appear in the bed, and at Chakur there is a running stream again. Shaghal Tapa consists of two villages, one the Kibitkas of the Goklan Turkomans, numbering some 50 families known as the Obah-i-Subhan Kuli Khan from the name of its headman on the north bank of the stream, and a settlement of some 30 families of Farsiwans from Kuhsar in Astrabad living in a village of reed huts on the south bank of the stream, Thermometer at 4 p.m . 73.211 no, 115— contd.

Almost the whole valley is uncultiyated. The soil is excellent and requires no irrigation, but owing to the want of population miles and miles of beautiful land are lying waste. This was not the case formerly, as 5 miles below Shaghal Tapa are the ruins of Shahrak and an old cemetery said to have belonged to the Garelis. There are also various old Tapas about. From Chakur march north round the end of the hills to the valley of the Gurgan, and then up the banks of that river to the head.quarters of the Baindar section of the Goklans camp. The road leads over bare undulating country covered with dry grass round the foot of the hills, till the Gurgan river at the 12th mile. Two miles out cross the Ab-i-Dahana at Gnzar-i- Dagh, and 3 or 4 miles beyond that the Ab-i- Karezli coming down from a little valley of its own. Goklan Obahs scattered about all along tbe road mostly of the Kirikh section which number some 400 families altogether. Like all Turkomans the Goklans have neither trees, gardens, water or fields anywhere near their settlements, the Kibitkas being simply struck down in the middle of the bare dry plain, the only difference between the Goklans and other Turkomans being that the former seem to have a partiality for putting their Kibitkas in straight rows, which the others, have not. The women have to fetch the water up from the nearest supply whatever the distance. The Gurgan river where it is crossed about 20 to 30 feet in width and 6 inches in depth, but it flows very low down in a large deep bed, some quarter of a mile in width, and quite 100 feet below the level of the surrounding country. The Baindar settlement consists of five Gbahs containing from 100 to 140families and occupies both banks of the Gurgan just after it issues from the bills. Baindar consequently is not the name of any fixed spot, and going to Baindar means simply going to any of the Obahs occupied by the Baindar section. Thermometer at 4 p.m, 71.°m No. ll5'*~concld.

Shortly after leaving Baindar the valley closes in r the bed of the river narrowed considerably, and leaves the open plain for the hills. The road leads up the banks of the river, passing several Obahs on the way. Wherever the bed of the river widens out sufficiently rice crops sown, but the slopes on either side generally dry and bare with a light friable soil. About a mile from Arkakli pass the mouth of thr Kai valley on the souths through which is a glimpse of wooded hills, but the forest seems all to have been left behind. The Kai section is said to number 200 families and the Kai stream joins the Yali Chashma stream and both flow together into the Gurgan which' may be said to commence as the river Gurgan at the head of the deep ravine forming its bed where^ the above-mentioned streams issue from the hills ; into the plain at the Baindar settlement. Arkakli consists of only some 100 families, 50 families having migrated to Chandir in Russian territory five or six years ago. It appears that since Russia occupied the Akhal, several migra* tions of Goklans have taken place.

The road traverses an open valley for 10 miles along the right branch of the Khnramabad river, and then goes for 4 miles among low hills. Direction N. W. The road goes for 8 miles among low hills, richly wooded, to the Ab-i-Kashgan a deep and impetuous stream, divided at this point into a number of narrow branches, which are crossed by rustic bridges of woven boughs. It then continues for 4 miles farther among hills and descends in to the plain of Alashtar, which it crosses for 20 miles, and then ascends some rising ground and arrives at the low hills at the entrance of the plain of Khawah. Direction N. W. The road traverses the lower plain from Khawah for 8 miles and crosses two streams ; it then ascends the high table-land of Khawah (considered the best pasturage in Persia) very gradually for 4 miles. It then crosses this magnificent pasturage, which is intersected throughout by rivulets at every 300 or 400 yards and is broken into knolls. Direction N. and W. The road crosses a rocky range of hills for 8 miles, and then descends into the valley of the Garmasab river, which is crossed by a ford, whence it joins the Hamadau road. Connects with Section II. N.B. —In winter this route is impracticable from the snow, and the road then goes by the Pul-i- Taskan and Hatilan. Another authority makes the total distance 144 miles and gives the following account of the road Five easy stages. The road presents but few ob stacles to the march of an army, except just after leaving Khuramabad, when it winds a good deal amongst the hills lying along the bed of a large stony river. No villages between these two towns but two; Harun about 28 miles from Karmanshah, and another at 32. Several very beautiful plains are passed. At Harun a large river is crossed, and another, by a fine bridge, 4 miles before reaching Karmanshah. Country well watered throughout by numerous rills from the mountains. Cow-dung, mixed with straw and baked, is uni versally used for fuel. Population of district for most part belongs to the Iliat tribe of Kurds ; there are also some Turks. The produce of grain in these parts, especially in the province of Kar manshah, is very abundant. (See also Section II.)223 No. 124. Kuchan to Bujnukd, vid AulJiorily —P. M.

Possibly it may have been destroy ed by an earthquake in its day and deserted for the present Kuchan, just as the latter was des troyed last year and was so nearly deserted for a fresh site still further east this year. From Hissar the road crosses the hills by a stony kotal, and then descends on to the village of Kuran in the valley on the other side at the foot of the higher ranges behind. Kuran is divided into two villages—one of Kurds and the other of Turks, each containing some 50 families. Camped between the two by the side of the line of gardens that borders the stream in the centre of the valley. A couple of miles down the banks of this stream is the Darband, where the Isfajir stream joins it, and both pass through the gorge together into the plains below. Supplies plen tiful. Road led uphill for the first 5 miles, passing the village of Safo at the 4th mile and then to the top of the kotal, an ascent of nearly 2/300 feet from Kuran. Then gradually descend, some 1,400 feet, into the Ogaz valley passing the villages of Osbeg at the 9th mile and Chapa at the 10th mile. The Ogaz valley or district contains six villages altogether, and is a fertile and well cultivated spot. The nomad flock owners all go across the border into Russian territory for the winter, paying a grazing-tax of from 10 to 16 krans per 100 shet^p. Eggs, fowls, ghee, and such like things, are also all taken to Askabad for sale. The road leads gradually up fhe hills on the north west of the valley for the first miles to the top of an easy kotal, a rise of about 1,000 feet, and thence down again for another 4| miles into the Tarkharan valley on the other side, passing the villages of Turan (not Taza Turan as noted in the map sheet No. 2) at the 6th mile to Daula right and Kala -i-Beg at the 8th mile.

Road leads down the Tarkharan vallej for the first 6 miles to the village of Doaha, situated at the jimction with the Tarkharan stream of the Jiristan stream from the north, the Tarkharan valley here falling about 100 feet a mile. Then turn up the narrow valley of the Jiristan stream, past the village of Milanlu-i-Pain at the 10th mile. The valley is well-wooded with apri cot, walnut, pear, and willow trees. Half a mile above Milanlu-i-Pain, a small settlement nameL Churma, where forty of the families lately evict ed from Firuza have been located. The Jiristan Baluk, in which Milanlu is situated, contains 15 villages with a total population of some 400 Kurd families. One of the villages is named Aikhas. Possibly the second, Ogaz,. marked in the map sheet No. 2, to the west of Durbadam, is meant for this. A second road from Hasan Kala to Milanlu leads direct over the hills, but said to be bad for laden mules, and the lower road taken in pre ference. Milanlu itself stands in an open upland and the weather is beautifully cool. There is a direct and well-worn road from Mil anlu to Askabad. Road leads gradually up for the first two miles to the foot of the hills, and thence for another two miles a steep climb up the face of the high,, range that here bounds the Jiristan district on the north. The rise from the village to the top of the kotal by aneroid was nearly 1,900 feet, making the height of the kotal, known as the Yanikara in Turki or Kharparan in Persian, 7,700 feet. The view from the top over the hills to the south was very fine, but the view to the north was stopped by another parallel range of greater height, called C}iu^an i said to now form the Russian frontier in this direction.

Descent on northern side of kotal runs down a long spur, and is very steep in places. Four miles down, in bed of the nullah, ravine entirely blocked fey a huge landslip of ancient date. The small lake formed thereby does not contain water for more than a month. The water gradually disappears underground, to appear again presumably in the form of the springs at Sir am and other places, which form the Firuza stream. The climb over this landslip is very rough, and below it the valley is again blocked by a succession of other slips, making the final descent into Sirani very steep. The village contains about 35 houses of Kurds and lies in a little basin at the head of defile leading down to Firuza. Descent down this defile very rapid. Coningham gives height of Firuza as 2,294 feet, so there is probably an average fall of nearly 300 feet per mile. The road leads up the valley to the village oi Sar- dao, 3J miles out, and at the 5th mile crosses a ridge with a steep and trying ascent and a des cent again on the other side to the little villager of Kalata. Thence the road passes over undu lating uplands to the Persian village of Khaira- bad, which stands on the edge of the plateau. The village consists of only a small fort and a few huts round it containing some 20 families of Kurds and Turks, and is said to be entirely snow-bound in winter. Russian Khairahad lies a mile or so to the north of the Persian village, and is only separated from the latter by a slight rise, just sufficient to mark the watershed which forms the boundary between the two places.

Found no water en route this side of the Regrawan, but obtained a sufficient supply by digging 3 feet or 4 feet. The Harut Rud here has very low banks, and its bed is not 100 yards wide, whilst the channel of main stream is only 30. The river is used for purposes of irrigation in Sabzawar and Anar- dara, and never reaches the Sistan Hamun. Route west by south across the Harut End, and Over a spongy tract and through a belt of jangle. At 25 minutes passed a wide and shallow water- run. Beyond this, turning west, we entered amongst hills running north and south and then emerged on to the undulating pasture tract of Arwita. Crossed this, and passing through a gap in Eejrkuh, entered on a similar pasture tract of Dam Dam, and crossing it, halted at Chah-i-Dam Dam, where is a shallow well of dark coloured, but not bad tasting water. Proceeding, passed through a gap in the Dam Dam hills, and dropped on to a wide and very long plateau, extending north and south between parallel ranges of hills. This is the Dasht-i- Naumed ; it extends north up to latitude of Mashad, and constitutes the boundary between Persia and Afghanistan. Crossed this plain in one hour and 15 minutes from side to side, by a well-beaten track. It ex tends, however, considerably both to north and south. Then entered a hollow between low spurs, and encamped at Chah-i-Sagak. Water very brackish and scarcely drinkable. This route by Chah-i-Sagak was the ancient high way and caravan route between Persia and India. The Afghan territory in this direction ends here. Route west between low ridges. At about 4 miles the gully widens and branches off between the hills to the north and south. In 1 hour and 15 minutes reached the watershed at a narrow gap (3,900').

Hence the path des cends to the dry bed ot the Rud-i-Mil, a wide shallow water-run. Proceeded up its course for some miles ; then, crossing a low ridge on left, halted in a. little hollow. Proceeded again north west and in 32 minutes entered a circular basin through a jery rough and stony gap. Crossed this basin in half an hour, and entered a similar, but wider, one through another stony gap. Beyond the second basin descended by a deep ravine, and came to a spring issuing from a rock. It is situated in a narrow gorge. Pollowed the course of the stream for a little way; then turn ing sharp to left, passed a water-mill, went over some rough ground, and in 20 minutes from the spring reached Duruh, a flourishing village of 300 houses. 7 H tjsenabad 27 141 Route west by north across the Duruh valley, which runs from north to south in a great sheet of pasture land. In 4 hours, on rounding the end of a low spur, came to Chah-i-Bannah,' the Pistachio Tree Well,' at the entrance to a defile in the hills. Water excellent. Proceeded up the defile along the course of the dry torrent, and in 45 minutes reached the Gudar-i- Mishan pass, the watershed between the Duruh and Husenabad valleys. The ascent is winding, but not steep until just at the pass (4,900'). Path is mostly along the bed of a narrow ravine, and would require some preparation for the passage of guns. The descent is by an easy path to the wide plateau of Husenabad, where is a neat little square fort with a bastion at each angle. Some cultivation. Large herds and flocks in valley. About 200 huts, and close by them a Jcarez of briny water. * 8 B aebisha 29 170 Route north-west over an open extensive plateau covered with excellent pasture, on which were some lliat camps and large flocks of gcats and sheep.

For wheeled vehicles the road would require a good deal of making and some blasting. The descent is easy, and by a good path, down to the Sar- bisha plain. Crossed the end of the plateau, and in 1 hour and 40 minutes from the pass arrived at the village of same name. It contains 350 domed buts. A good deal of corn cultivation around the village.

Eoute north-west along the skirt of Sarbisha hiD on our left (the wide plateau on our right). At about B miles is a hollow' at the foot of the hills, and on left is a spring and clump of trees. At about 2 hours the road turns west, and, leaving the plateau to the right, enters an open glade between two hills. These further on diverge and enclose a wide basin called Haoz-i-Khnn Bayaban from an ahambar of that name in its- centre. Eeached this cistern in 2 hours and 20 minutes from Sarbisha. Proceeding north-west from the ahamhar, in 10 minutes came to some undulating ridges, and crossing these came to a low watershed. The descent was gradual and along the course of a rocky ravine, and conducted to a tract of downs. Crossed these north-west, leaving the Baghran range on left, and the Sarbisha plateau on right. Beyond these downs turned to left over some low mounds, and descended into the Mod valley, reaching camp in 2 hours and 25 minutes from Haoz-i-Khan ahamhar* Mod is a poor-looking village of some 300 houses. Route west by north down the slope of the Mod valley by a well-beaten track. Route held a course parallel to some ridges to right, about a mile or so from road. At 2 hours and 55 minutes, having passed en route two ahambars (the first dry) halted at a third, opposite a gap in a ridge, through which the Mod stream runs to the Sarbisha valley, and there joins another ravine that passes through Birjund and drains to the Khush river.289 No. 180— concld.

Thence descent 2,000' to the village of Agdash, 15 miles over plain sloping easily to the north east reach Chapishlu. Total descent from sum mit of pass (about) 3,000'. The descent of the Maidan Khana Pass is steep and impracticable for guns, but the hill-slopes are soft and a road might easily be cut. The ascent of 1,000' to the crest of Allah-u-Akbar is impracticable, the hill side being formed of bare limestone rock, and seamed with deep precipitous gulleys. The des cent of 3,000'is good, the road having apparently been made, and guns might with care be driven down. The valley following the Kibkan stream to Abivard also appears quite impractic able for guns, and is shut in by precipitous spurs on both sides. Prom the village of Darband an alternative road goes back over the shoulder of Kuh-i-Imarat, a mountain to the east passing to the east of Tubil, reaches Eadkan, in the valley. It is shorter, but avoided by caravans on account of the steep and bad ascent of the Dumji Pass.

There is a ruined fort in a very strong position, high above the left bank of a stream, with steep scarped sides. It is not commanded, and could be made almost impregnable, and a short covered way would enable the garrison to procure water from over the clilf. The road crosses numerous low but steep spurs to the valley of Kala-i-Minar. The defile of this valley affords a very strong position. The nor thern entrance is almost completely shut up by the hill through which it passes, and a few hours' work here would render this one of the strongest positions that could be found anywhere. The ascent to the summit of the range is very easy, through a picturesque valley with trees and water, and bounded by rugged ridges of a red stone. This valley, as indeed the whole way to Shahr-i-Nao, affords the most splendid grazing ground even in July, and for this reason it is clearly the line that should be taken by the cav alry of a force proceeding to the east, if other things permitted. The defile of Kala-i-Minar is certainly impracticable for artillery as it stands, but it could easily be made practicable in a few hours as the soil of the hill is soft. The summit of the pass is called the Uardan-i-Kala-i-Minar, It abounds in strong positions, and the road is completely commanded by a very steep, rugged, and impracticable ridge which runs along the left the whole way. The descent is gradual to the plain for about 8 miles, and is quite good and practicable for artillery. From the foot of the hills the road traverses an extensive plain covered with thick scrub to the fortified village of Himmatabad. There is, however, a suitable spot for a camp at the foot of the hills, and in deed watei: and fuel are procurable all along the route. A good road. From Kala it leads down the right bank of a small stream, partly through cul tivation and partly through splendid pastureland. The road traverses a waste with no water, no in habitants ; a low ridge is crossed shortly after leaving Shahr-i-Nao. Mashad-i-Reza is the name of two villages about a mile apart, comprising, one, a hundred, and tbe other about 60 bouses. A fair supply of good water and plentiful cultiva tion.250 No. 137— conid.

Cross broad uncultivated plain, annually innundated and liable to be im passable from March to end of April. At G miles, pass a ruined tank, two miles to left of road, and parallel to it line of deserted buildings noticed, 6 or 7 miles long. At 10 miles ruined caravansarai and tank of Dugharu. The fort here a mere mound. Afghan outpost accommodated at caravansarai. Their water sup ply from covered tank, filled in rains. No force of any size could depend on it for water. As a rule a force would have to march straight from the Ilari Rud, opposite Kuhsan to Karez (about 22 miles via Kafir Kala and 28 miles by the wet weather route above mentioned). 12 Tibpul 12 172 Country on left bank of Hari Rud from Xafir Kala waterless and uncultivated. The low plain extending from the Hari Rud to Kafir Kala is in the dry season heavy with sand and friable soil, which during the rains be comes absolutely impassable even for a horse man, so deep is the mud. The road from Karez to Tirpul then makes a detour to the south along the lower slopes of the Sang-i-Dukhtar range. About 7 miles from Tirpul the Hari Rud carves northward towards Toman Agha. The road from Kafir Kala vid, Kuhsan to Tirpul is practicable for all arms, as also the road along the left bank, except at the approaches to the bridge, which are several feet deep in water in the flood season. A raised roadway to remedy this defect might be carried away as was, several times, that made in 1888 for the Afghan Boun dary Commission. Except in the flood season, therefore, there is no great difficulty in taking infantry, cavalry, pack transport and mule artil lery across the Tirpul bridge, despite the uneven- ness of the roadway.

Even on 18th April, at Tirpul ' the roads were still in places mere broad running streams, and the soil a great quagmire, in which our horses fre quently sank above their hocks, and could not extricate themselves until the rider dismounted.' In fact an immense amount of damage was done to houses and property. All this shows how military movements on this line would be serious ly inconvenienced by periodical bursts of bad weather. (He made the distance 168 miles.) * # * * At about 2 miles river, taking a bend northward, has eaten away right bank up to foot of outlying spurs of plateau. The road therefore runs across the spurs. With this exception the road from Tirpul to Herat is perfectly practicable for all arms and for wheeled transport: and, even here, a Pioneer battalion would remove difficulties in a few hours. From the Tirpul Valley, road runs south by east to Shahbash, a fortified village on slight eminence. It might be made key of strong defensive position commanding passage of Valley.

At 7 miles, pass small aoul 20 houses. At 7^ miles a stream joins from right, and above junction is a curious conical hill with scarped sides called Panj Mar, (or Panj Mund) which offers another impregnable site from which to command the pass— {MacGregor}, Here there is a small valley one mile long, and at the end of it road splits in two, the one to left going by an exceedingly difficult defile (Tang-i- Shikasta) impracticable for guns, the other going over the hill to right by Shiga defile, and joining the left road about 2 miles further on— {Mac- Greg or). Position at this point is unassailable, road leading straight up to a cliff, going between precipices, and apparently coming to a cul-de-sac, as no sign of a road is seen. The hill rises 400' above defile, and searches every foot of it for a mile. It would be possible to ascend the hills on the south bank of the defile, and going along the crest, get in behind the position half a mile to the rear, and descend from this to the Tang-i-Shikasta, whence a steep path leads up to the rear of the hill; but this path is so close that it would be impossible to get up by it unperceived, and no troops could force their way up. It might be possible to turn this position on its right, but the hills are so open that there would be little chance of doing so without being exposed and the paths up to it are all of an extremely impracticable nature—(i^cGmjror).

The villages in the hills between Andarukh and Balghur are known by the general name of Chulaikhana, being the settlements of the Chulais, a Turk tribe, but speaking both Tuiki and Persian. The head of the tribe is Abul Fatteh Khan, who lives at Marish, a village about a farsakh south of Balghur, and is the hereditary Governor of the- district, independent of Kalat. There are about seventy families in Balghur, but they say the weather is so cold that grapes will not grow here and they have little fruit. The altitude by the barometer is about 6,000 feet, a rise of 1,200 during this march. Returing about a mile to Rubat-i-Balghur the road^ runs for about 1| miles up the main valley, then a narrow gorge in the rocks. The road then? winds on up the nullah for another 3| miles r when another bad gorge is reached; at the top of that the road divides that to the left or west going, it is said, direct to Charam, and that to the right or east, to Bardeh. A mile beyond this^ the watershed is reached at a low kotal called Kamar-i-Pirzan, with a rise from Balghur of some 1,500 feet. Beyond this instead of the narrow rocky defiles ; previously gone through, an undulating open country on the top of the hills, known as the Karadagh range, and the roads run along this up and down, crossing ridge after ridge. A mile from the Kamar-i-Pirzan, a small hamlet of nomads where a road branches off to the left to the village of Abkamak. Some Sf miles beyond that the second kotal, called the Deve Boyun, or, in Persian, Shutar Gardan, is reached, after several steep ascents and descents, with an eleva tion of some 230 feet less than that of the Pir- zan, but with a much steeper approach. The ascent from the south is very rocky and difficult for laden mules, and impassable for camels. The descent on the north is very steep for the first 800 feet, and then it winds down to the village of Bardeh, some 770 feet further down in the valley below. \263 No. 139— concld.

The descent down this on the northern s^e of the hills very steep, comprising first a sudden drop from an elevation of some 6,400 feet to about 5,000 to the bed of a nullah where water is reached, and thence down the nullah between scarped hills on either side till camping-ground reached at the junction of this nullah with the Istiksu nullah, some 5 miles from the top of the pass and with a further descent of some 800 feet. The village of Istiksu contains some fifty families of Jalairs.

E bmabks, Note, —This route connects with Routes Nos. 28, 29, 30 and 32 of Section III, Central Asian Routes. M. de Blocqueville, a French photographer, accom panied a Persian expedition against the Turko mans of Merv in 1860. On the I9th May 1860, the troops marched to Kala Yahudi, 3 leagues from Mashad on the road to the valley of Ak Darband. Water and forage obtainable. The army was here divided into two corps. M. de Blocqueville accompanied the first column, which marched in the direction of the Ak Darband valley, through which the Pol-shai flows. Water very bad. This river flows E. and falls into the Tejend or Herat River. Following its course, the troops passed Karabagh village, surrounded by strong walls to protect it against the Turkomans, and a little farther an other village of the same kind, but in ruins and uninhabited. The next places mentioned are Chahar Gumbaz, or ' 4 domes,' ruins close to the stream. Mazdaran, a fort on the summit of a mountain and visible from the banks of the river. It guards the mountain pass against the Turkomans. Sarakhs is reached from this point by a shorter road than that through Naorozabad. ^ Ak Darband guards both the mountain pass and the passage of the river flowing between scarped banks. The fort was held by 40 or 50 men, with two cannons. It was later abandoned and replaced by the fort of Shurja, with a garrison of 200 men. The river bank was overgrown with reeds, which had to be fined. At Shurja the column took a mountain road to Naorozabad, a fort with 200 men, at the entrance to the plain of Sarakhs, on the left bank of the Tejend River. This fort must be considered as marking the limits of the province of Khorasan, as the fortress of Sarakhs, although belonging to the Persians, does not give them possession of territory which they can cultivate, and on which the garrison sets foot only for the purpose of cutting wood and grass. On the 1st June, the column reached Sarband, where it encamped, distance 120 miles from Mashad. Here the troops were employed in constructing a dam on the Tejend, a branch of which had flowed in a north erly direction and had even reached Kacha Kum by means of canals, after watering ancient Sarakhs.267 No. 143.

There is no necessity for stopping at Ghuskan (Route No. 144), or of crossing bridge there, unless one desires to travel by the left bank of the Kashaf Eud, also called Ab-i-Mashad. The Prince Rukn-ud-Daula used the left bank this year (1890), driving in a carriage, as the ground is harder. The two routes join at Robat-i-Mahi. Ground near Chilghai not so good for camp, as that at Kalshur close by. Water {kanat or from the Kashaf Eud). Supplies, fowls, eggs, milk, lucerne, barley, wheat, in limited quantities, but several neighbouring villages could contribute con si durable quantities. A good road or railway would be easily run to this place. Kalshur has forty families, and twenty pairs bullocks. Chil ghai has twenty families, twelve pairs of bullocks (or ploughs). ^ Its water is from the Kashaf Rud.

Direct route along bank of river to Shurja cannot be used owing to boulders and jungle, but it is said that there are no other difficulties, and that a good road could be easily constructed. The Ak Darband is the easiest route to Masbad from Pul-i-Khatun, but possibly river route might be preferred, if properly cleared, as it is perfectly level, and near water the whole way. If not liable to floods, a railway will probably be brought by this route by the Russians to Mashad. From Robat-i-Mahi (2,358 feet), road to Mazdaran gradually ascends over rolling ground to point where, at 4 miles, a bend of river almost touches road. In hot weather this would not be a bad place to halt at, as there are trees and shade, and no more water is met with during the rest of stage. Hence road steadily ascends to the plateau on which is the village of Mazdaran, at foot of pass (3,000' by aneroid); 16 families in village ; 5 ploughs and'fine spring of water ; good site for summer camp for small force, and large force could be encamped on summit of hill and neighbouring ridges.

This tract, he said, was practicable only for camels, who covered the distance in three days, getting no water the whole time. By this route caravans could reach Bandar Abbas in 28 days, viz., 13 days from Birjand to Karman and 15 days from Karman to Bandar Abbas; but by the longer route more to the east, vid Neh and Bam, took 50 days. Caravans only went to Bandar Abbas once a year, going and returning during the winter.

This is nothing but a long winding street in the midst of plantations. Beyond, path is very narrow and broken, and leads up winding course of a rapid hill torrent, which we crossed some 30 times. In one hour from Targobah reached Jagar, on the bank of the torrent. This route is impracticable for camels, so baggage was sent from Mashad by Sharifabad to Nishabur. See foot-note, p. 570. Jagar is 4,650', above the sea and 1,460', above Mashad. Climate damp, and in winter rigorous. Thomson's account for this stage is as follows : Road for first 8 miles excellent across level plain • then ascend small hill by easy path, and at 10 miles, just before reaching Gulistan, take direct road across low hill to right front, and strike into valley at Ambaran, 18 miles.

In 2 hours and 45 minutes came to ahamhar i &amp;x\&amp; beyond this, bending round to the west, in 40 minutes reached the Sadarabad sarai. There is a good ahambar here and a fortified hamlet opposite the sarai; it contains 30 houses, but only 7 inhabitants. Formerly from 15,000 to 20,000 pilgrims used to pass this way annually, but during the past three years but few have come. There is no cultivation here, nor are any supplies procurable. Sadarabad is a new and capacious sarai. Beyond this the road goes W. by S. across a desert tract of light sand and clay, bare of vegetation. In 30 minutes came to Pul Abrasham. This is a very ancient and decayed brick-bridge of a single high arch across the Kal Abrasham, a good stream of clear, fresh water on a sandy bottom, which is easily forded.

Beyond this the road leads over some low slaty ridges and then crosses a wide stony hollow to Abbasabad. In 1 hour and 10 minutes came to a collection of three or four springs in a hollow to the right, and in 45 minutes more arrived at Abbasabad. Good Icarez streams; but very little corn cultivation. Eoute westerly. From Abbasabad skirted the desert for a short distance, and then entered on a very rough hillskirt of low slaty ridges. In 1 hour and 20 minutes we entered the Dahna A1 Hak between rugged hills. The defile winds by an easy ascent between close-set hills of no great height. Cleared the pass in 25 minutes, and in 5 minutes more came to the A1 Hak sarai, which is fast going to ruin. There is a small village here of 50 houses, but it only contains a few families ; around it are a few mulberry trees, and there is a g@od little Tcarez close by. Beyond this the road goes over an open but very broken country. In 'So minutes came to a small gap in alow ridge, and then continued route over similar country to that previously traversed, and at length reached an open gravelly plain, in the centre of which stands the Miandasht sarai. There is no village here, but the sarai is fortified and contains 30 resident families. A new sarai is in course of construction. Water from a Icarez stream. The residents here all derive their supplies from Maiomai. See Index. Route westerly over very broken country, sloping to the N. in which direction it drains to the Jajarm valley. In 2 hours and 40 minutes came to a deep gully, called Dahna Zaidar. In 1 hour and 40 minutes from the gully reached the Zaidar fort, on the edge of a wide ravine. This fort is garrisoned by 50 sarhaz. Beyond the fort are some trees and a Tcarez, but no cultivation. The road hugs the hills bound ing the valley or plain to the south. The great plain called Kavir is covered with pasture and dotted with Turkoman towers. In 1 hour and 35 minutes from the fort arrived at Maiomai. Road very rough and stony.

In 1 hour from Maiomai crossed a good kai'ez stream, and in 1 hour and 30 minutes more came to an ahamhar close to a low ridge that extends from S. W. to N. E. Across the plains cresting this ridge, passed on to a very uneven country in tersected by ravines and hollows, and covered with pasture. In hours from the ahamhar ridge, came to the deserted sarai of Farashabad, also called Rah- matabad. In 55 minutes from this, still over broken country, came to an ahamhar. Beyond tbis the route is due W. over an open plain, gently sloping towards Shahrud. In 2 hours and 5 minutes came to the ruins of Khairabad, amidst which are cornfields and a few occupied huts watered from a small harez. In 30 minutes more came to a thin and very muddy stream from the village and gardens of Badasht, a little to left, then rising gently, in 20 minutes more came to a lar^e Jcarez stream, and crossing it entered on a hard, stony hillskirt, traversed up to Shahrud.

From this point the road descends quickly along the course of a dry, pebbly ravine, occasionally rising over low undulations abutting upon it from the heights on either side. In 1| hours came to the ruins of a little fort on the left of the ravine. Beyond this the road turns off to the right, W.S.W., and, crossing some ups and downs, comes to the Chashma Karam spring. We reached this in 10 minutes, and then ascend ing by a steep, narrow and stony path entered on an undulating tract of low ridges and hollows, and in 12 minutes more reached the crest of a watershed (5,600' above the sea). Descent by a difficult and narrow path down the bed of a winding gully or water-cut, mostly dry, but here and there were moist spots from oozing springs ; the gully leads to a wide, stony hiliskirt which slopes down to the plain. The wide tract of low hills now passed form a barrier between the valleys or plains of Damghan and Samnan. Following the long slope of the hillskirt along ihe line of telegraph, gradually entered on the plain, and in 2 hours from the ridge came to an aham- har. Here the road turns a point to the W., and leads across a wide, stony, parched and sterile plain (girt on all sides by distant hills) up to Samnan. Samnan is a telegraph station ; the town has a flourishing look and is plentifully supplied with water from several good karez streams. 19 Labgied 22 431 Route westerly.

This district produces much corn, and is considered one of the gran aries of Tehran. Eoute W.N.W. across cultivation for a mile or so, and then on to a gravelly pasture tract, gently sloping up the hills in front. In 1 hour and 50 minutes we entered the Sirdara defile of the Kuh-i-Tuz (?) through a low ridge of hills, that end on the plain a few miles to the left. The defile is easy, with low hills on either side. In 30 minutes came to the ruins of a small mud fort in the centre of a basin in the defile, and in 45 minutes more emerged from the defile on to a wide plateau. A thin stream of no depth, and crossed several times, flows N. and S. through the central basin. The plateau to its N. is green with pasture, and near the defile has a good strip of corn cultivation; crossed it N.W., skirting low hills to right, and in 1 hour and 50 minutes came to a deep and rough boulder stream ravine, on the farther bank of which stands Aiwan- i-Kaif. This is a flourishing village of 300 houses round a fort, and is surrounded by gardens and vineyards, 'watered from a strong harez stream. To the S. W. the country slopes down to the wide plain of Yeramen (?).

The fort above the village and the walls around it are now in ruins, and half the population has been moved to Mu- hammadabad further south. The village now contains about 100 houses. The hanats during the times of the Turkoman raids were allowed to fall into disrepair, and the people are now too poor to dig them out afresh, and the consequence is that the gardens around, are mostly dried up. Large quantities of unirrigated grapes though are grown here and are turned into raisins. The valley here is said to drain down to Khartut, but there are no inhabitants in it beyond a few Goklans who have lately settled at Khartut itself, and the reeds are said to be very thick further down.

These ranges of hills and valleys are all parallel, running west hy north and east by south. The ground gradu ally slopes to the west. The country looks bare and brown, and can be ridden over anywhere.

Wheafe and riee are the staple crops, and once the fear of the Yamuts is removed the area under cultiva^ tion will increase year hj year. The probability is that a new village will shortly be built at Gazabad, as the people, once danger is removed,, will soon get tired of coming all tiie way from Bashkala to look after their crops, and thus the* valley of the Atrak will be gradually repopulated. The number of old wells and water channels show that the valley was well cultivated in olden days,, and there is no reason that it should not be so again, unless indeed Russia steps in and prohibits further cultivation on the plea of there not being- sufficient water for her subjects lower down. As it is, the whole valley from Kharaki right down to Chat is said to be entirely uninhabited. Kharaki itself consists at present of 30 families of Firuzagis from the 400 who were turned out of that village when it was handed over to the- Kussians. Much malarial fever at present, but as the ground is cleared, the fever will probably diminish, Atrak valley here about a mile in width as a rule,, perfectly level and with a rich soil. At present it is covered with low reeds, camel-thorn, thistles and weeds about 2 feet in height. On the south a range of hills known as the Bishum runs'' parallel with the river some 2 miles back, and on the right bank a little below Kharaki is a long high hill called Buz dag hi. Both ap parently sink lower and lower as they go west. Climate of valley warm. Hills on either side bare and brown, and country generally looks hot. Land at KharaJci irrigated from spring in nullah coming down from north but water runs through a thick reed beds, and is not good for drinking.

There the stream comes from a curious piece of bog in which is a fine wi|low, A sarai left unfinished and a man who sells very limited supplies. The road continues to ascend, and at 15 miles rises to 6,400' and then descends through narrow valley. At 17 miles (just where the valley widens out and the Karman road turns due south), the course is south-east and at 18J miles there are strawberry-and-cream- coloured hills to left, distant about a mile.

There are two old forts, one on either .side, at some distance above track. Their present use is to act as a landmark for the numerous caravans which come from Sistan in the winter. From this point the big range at the point behind Di Kuh changes direction and runs nearly due west. The hills, which were covered with snow, must reach to a height of 9,000' to 10,000'.

At 7| miles Bagh Bala: both these hamlets occupy a narrow strip along left bank of stream. At 8J miles the valley narrows to a breadth of 100 yards and thenqe forward the track is mainly in the river-bed. At 11 miles the valley again narrows to a still' greater degree at a miir below which is the famous Khar Shikan pass. Its worst feature consists in a huge rock which so bars up the valley that no animal witli • its load on could pass. Added to this there is - a copsideiable drop, but still, compared- with the passes on the Shiraz-Bushire road, beyond its extreme narrowness, there is no great difficulty, that a charge of dynamite could not remove. At llf miles gorge widens out and the Sarai-i-Khar Shikan, a few stone huts with a guard, is reached. Only milk and bread are obtainable. Just below the stream disappears, not reappearing until 14 miles, where there is a bamboo thicket. At J.6 miles the valley again commences to widen out, and there are patches of bamboos which form excellent food for cattle. At 17 miles a hamjet Bisha and just below Boz- i-Kuh.

Total. 1 B ekendi 26 26 From Pachinar to Akbaba there are two roads j the one via Karza and Mazeran ; and the other via Mula Ali and Bekendi. Of the two routes, tbat of the Xarza is generally followed, not less on account of its being the better route, than that of its being the post road. The roads divide within 400 yards of Pachinar, the Karza one going to the left up the pass, and the Bekendi one up the bed of a torrent, a tributary of the Safed liud, which it joins below Pachinar. Again, in 1887, a road was made from Pachinar to Bekend. Shortly after its construction, the rains swept away the whole construction. The road was never rebuilt, as what now exists of the former one is merely a track, which caravans occasionally follow when the Karza is blocked with snow. This track keeps to the bed of the torrent for the first nine miles, as far as a small village, called Mula Ali. Supplies to a very limited quantity are procurable here-, but the houses are uninhabi table, except by Persians. For about the next two miles the road keeps along the side of the mountains, and then again des cends into the torrent bed. The road gradually keeps ascending, is rough and very bad going for the next 12 miles, keeping in a south-easterly direction. At about 12 miles from Mula Ali, the torrent splits in two, one coming from the south-east and the other from the north-east for a short distance, and then almost north-west. The former is the Hamadan route, and the latter the Bekendi one. It would seem as if one was marching back on a parallel road, separated only by a mountain, for at least two miles. The stream then takes an easterly direction. Before reaching this point the road goes through a very narrow gorge in the mountains, so narrow in fact that a mule with a good^load could just get through. On either side there is sheer perpendicular rock of from two to three hundred feet. This gorge or cut is about half a mile long; on emerging from it the road comes out on the open, and keeps in an easterly direction into Bekendi.

From Bekendi to Akbaba is about 12 miles; there is a very fair road, much the same as the Kasvin-Akbaba one. About four miles out of Bekendi, the road crosses a low range of sand-hills, and at six miles from that place is a small village called Kuhin. Just before reaching Kuhin a road branches off to the left to Mazeran. Taking the^ two routes, the Karza one is prefer able, as it is eight miles less and there is a made road. A very good road could easily be made via Bekendi. For a railway the Bekendi route would undoubt edly be followed, as it is nearly level the whole way, the only difficulty being the gorge referred to, while the Karza has a sudden ascent up to a height of seven or eight thousand feet.

One of these crosses the river, and turns the defile of the Hari-Rud, leading back to the Persian bank of the river near Zurabad. The main drawbacks of this road are the two crossings over the river, which are not practicable at all times of the year. Moreover, it is said, they327 No. 170— contd.

The second and shortest route over the mountains,which I followed, cannot properly be called a road ; in parts it is not so much even as a bridle path. The third and long est, at the same time the best route, is that which passes through Turbat-i-Shekh-Jam and Lenkar to Zurabad. The mountainous portion of this road is got over in only one day's journey. The second of these routes from Pesh-Robat follows the bank of the Hari-Eud to Kalsan-Kala, after which it turns to the west, and crosses the Jam, 3 versts (2 miles), from the confluence of that river with the Hari-Rud. Beyond this point the country is hilly ; the road passes the ruins of Kala-i-Melu near a fresh water spring, and 8 versts (5i miles) farther enters the mountains, through which it runs as a narrow path over the bare rocks through defiles and deep valleys and over high passes. In many parts there is not even a track of any kind. For pack animals this section of the route is very difficult; the clearing of a carriage road would be a great undertaking, There is plenty of water, as there is a stream in every defile, and there is excellent forage. The mountain slopes are covered with trees, and near the Galabat spring there is a pretty thick forest. We emerged from the mountains at a point within 12 versts (8 miles) of a Sal or settlement, and passed a line of neglected Jcarez, and then along a copious stream diverted into the fields at Zurabad. Zurabad is now acquiring a very great importance. With the sanction of the Persian Government, as many as 2,000 tents of Salors have been pitched there. There are two roads from Zurabad fo Pul-i-Khatun : the first and shortest passes through the moun tains ; the second crosses to the eastern bank of the river and returns to the Persian shore through the Garman-Darband,where it joins the first road. The mountain road as far as Deana-Darband is difficult; it is very much like the route from Kale-i-Melu to Zurabad. Near Deana-Darband, the road runs down to the Hari-Rud, and passes along the bank of that river to Sarakhs. Here, on the eastern side of the river, the mountains stretch as far almost as Pul-i-Khatun. On the Persian side, however, they stand away from the river, and the road runs only here and there over low spurs, while from Pul-i-Khatun to328 No. 170— Pesh Robat to Sauakhs, via Zorabad, Vul-i-Khatun and Naorozahad.

In former ti nes the road from Sarakhs to Pul-i-Khatnn lay through Daolatabad and Shnrja, standing away from the river, and over a difficult ground. This was considered the safer way, but since the country has been pacified that route has been abandoned. This route is very important, as it would probably be used by an army marching from Shahrud to Khorasan. It lies on an average about 25 miles north of the post road. Pul-i-Khatun signifies woman's bridge. The four arches of the bridge still exist. The central and fifth arch was, however, destroyed by Mehdli Khan during his expedition to Merv. The total length of the bridge is 25 fathoms; the Kara- Su (Kashaf-Rud) joins the Hari-Rud near the bridge. The breadth of the river at that part is about six fathoms, the depth is very inconsider able, the water not being higher than a horse's knees, yet the ford is very inconvenient owing to the big stones in the bed of the river. en^s The foregoing route should be studied with the aid of Condie Steph excellent map of the Hari-Rud Valley. From this it would appear that the stages and distances are as follows from Pesh Robat kala kaxsan® JAM RIVEB E ntrance or Y aki T ut P ass Zoeabad m 10 Direction due N. along valley of Hari-Rud, and about f of a mile west of river : much of ground is swampy, but in parts there is good pas turage ; Kala Kalsang in ruins. 12 22 Here 2 or 3 miles above its junction with Hari- Rud is open ground suitable for camp and good grazing.

Condie Stephen makes the following general observations regarding the roads to Sarakhs and the laterveniog country :— From Kafir Kala the river runs in a northerly direction along an uninhabited but fertile valley, piercing the Jam and Siah Babak ranges through a gorge known by the name of Tangi Daria. This gorge is exceedingly narrow in parts, and is impassable for all arms, except in the late summer, when a few horsemen might, by crossing and re-crossing the shallows, force their way through the thick brushwood and jungle. On the right hanh from the Siah Babak range northward the ground is high and undulating as far as Daolatabad, where the hilly waves finally subside into the desert. On the left bank, after the Jam mountains are crossed, the ground330 No. 170— contd. Pesh Robat to Sauakhs, vid Zofahad,Vd-i-Khatun No. of stage. Names of stages. D istancks in miles, Interme diate. Total. E bmabks, is flatter thf\n on the right, there being a tract of open fertile land near the river, burther on, the stream winds westward round the foot of'a high range till it reaches Pul-i-Khatun, whence, after running eastward for a few miles, it again flows northward in a widening valley to Sarakhs. Between Kuhsan and Naorozabad (18 miles south of Sarakhs) the country on botli sides of the stream is uninhabited, except at Wo spots, Muhsinabad and Zorabad. Portions of the valley abound in natural pasturage, and the land near the banks between Toman Agha and Tangi Daria, and between _ Pul-i-Khatun and Sarakhs, mighl easily be irrigated. Rain fall said to be small. Usual rainy seasons are November, April, and beginning of May. River water wholesome, but somewhat muddy in winter and spring. Country roads. —At present the best route from Kuhsan to Sarakhs is vid Karez, Turbat-i-Shekh- Jam, Lankar and the Pesh Kamar pass. In the summer of 1882, the Governor-General of Khora- san travelled from Sarakhs to Turbat by this route in a caleche. The whole length of this road is about 163 miles, that is to say, ] 8 miles longer than the Khumbao and Kizil Bulak route. Small supplies are obtainable at the three inhabited spots mentioned above. In ^ summer time the best road from Zorabad to Pul*i-Khatun is by the Sehamad-din (?) ford. The river is re-crossed a few miles south of the Garmab pass. Between Turbat and the river there are three passes in the Jam range, viz., Beni Tak, Stoi, and Yaki Tut. Of these the Stoi route, though a mere pathway, is the best To the east of the Hari-Rud, eight separate roads and path- ways cross the Siah Babak range (Barkhut moun tains) enumerated from the river. Eastward they are as follows (Mialsheni, Karangan, Khumbao (Sang Nevesht), Osiabad, Aomesar Chashma Sabz, Valad, and Chahar Velang. The Khumbao pass is the easiest. According to information supplied by the guide who accom panied M. Lessar along that route, it is even in its present condition available for light carts. 1 he first four of the above-named routes converge at Karez Elias, where there is a plentiful supply of good water. An easy road leads from Karez Elias to Zurabad vid the Kulfakar ford. Gradients. — The gradients in the Stoi pass and in the pass leading from ZoraVad to Garmab331 No. 170— con eld.

The total resources in provisions of the three inhabited towns in the neighbourhood of the Hari-llud are as follows : Karez— 600 quarters of wheat, 3,000 sheep, 30 oxen j Muhsinabad — 2,250 quarters of wheat, 7,000 sheep, 1,000 oxen and cows and goats ; Zorabad—7,500 quarters of wheat, 400 oxen and cows, 2,000 sheep.

This by degrees became worse and worse, and, with the exception of a dry bit here and there, proved little better than that to Pir-i-Bazar. After about a farsakh and a half through a swampy forest, with a thick underwood of brambles, alders, and a variety of climbing plants, crossed a small rivu let called the Nura, some 5 yards broad, and now only a few inches deep. It has not the appearance of ever becoming a large stream, though, close to ford, it has a high bridge of one arch which however did not seem to be much used, being overgrown with rank vegetation. A far sakh farther, village of Kuch-i-Isfaban. Con tinuing onwards over a slightly improved path, arrived on the banks of the Safed End. River at this season is never very large, and, owing to the late dry weather, was not so full as usual. Still it was too deep and rapid to ford, and at least 100 yards across. One bank was abrupt ; the other was low and covered with fragments of rocks and trees, marking the course of the wide and rapid torrent, which the river becomes in the spring. Tillage of Rashtabad is situated a short distance from the river, though not visible from its banks, being concealed among the trees. Road to Lahijan lay through alternations of na tural forest, mulberry plantations, and rice fields ; and though at first very bad, gradually became better. The country also seemed to improve, being more open, and not such a continual swamp as heretofore. After about a farsakh crossed two small streams a few hundred yards distant from each other by a couple of single arched bridges built of brick. From this point road became good; sometimes hedged in on either side by a magnificent growth of box, which chiefly composed the underwood of the forest, and sometimes opening on a beautiful landscape of cottages, lawns, and cultivation. Another farsakh on, arrived at the river Shimarud which, flowing from the mountains, enters the Safed Rud near its mouth. Crossed the Shima- rud over a lofty, pointed bridge, built of brick, and seemingly in good repair, having two large centre arches, and two smaller ones on each side.333 No. 172— contd, H asht io A mul.

Langarud Rud-i-Sae The river flows over a gravelly bed, and, though at this season only about 60 yards broad and. fordable in many places, bears the appearance of becoming a rapid torrent in the spring. For 2 or 3 miles now traversed a more open country, covered with brambles and fern, without any trees, and arrived at another bridge of four arches, similar to that just mentioned, across the river flowing to Langarud. It is about the same size as the Shimarud, and resembles it in general appear ance. Lahijan, about 3 farsakhs(12 milesj from Kasvin, is situated on the east bank. Road lay over the remains of old stone causeway. The pavement was composed, of square blocks of stone and large boulders, broken up and inters persed with deep holes full of mud, forming a path most painful and injurious to the horses, and which in any other country would have been deemed perfectly impracticable. The hills rose abruptly on route, intersected by deep ravines, and covered with forest, from which occasionally peeped, forth grey masses of stone. Here came upon a rivulet. After travelling along the foot of the mountains for about 8 miles, turned towards the sea, over a flat country cleared for the cultivation of rice. The road still continued in the shape of a cause way through the swamps, but it had been re paired in many places, and a few hundred yards from Langarud, had been substantially recon structed with stones and brick. The road, sometimes dry and sometimes deep in mud, lay as usual through alternate intervals of swampy forest, ricefields, and mulberry planta tions. After about an hour's travelling, arrived at a small branch of the river Shalmun, now a mere rill, trickling over its pebbly bottom, but when full about 15 yards wide. Continued along its bed up to the main stream, which is forded, and then passed through a village of the same name situa ted on its banks. The Shalmun has its rise in the mountain of Sammon, one of the loftiest peaks of the Elburz Eange, along this part of the coast; river was at this season about 60 yards wide, and not more than a foot and a half deep. A short distance farther over a wretched pathway, crossed small river (Balisar), the boundary of district of Ranaku, and then, passing through large village of that name, and fording another small interme diate stream, came to the Kiarud, over which there is a lofty brick bridge in good repair. Then334 No. nz—contd. Rasht to Amul. No. of stage. B D istancbs in miles. E bmaees. Names of stages. [nterme- diate. Total. entered the village of Rud-i-Sar, a halting-place. The distance between Langarud and Kud-i-Sar a little more than 8 miles. 5 SUEMIEU Leaving Eud-i-Sar, jnst ontside village, forded the river Naorud, about 15 yards wide, running over a sandy bed between high and thickly wood ed banks, and after about half an hour s ride came to the seashore, along which road lay during the remainder of the day's march. The scenery along these shores of the Caspian is usually of the same character,—a narrow strip of sand bordered on one side by the sea, and on the other by a belt of forest, beyond which is a level—sometimes wooded and sometimes cleared—backed by a range of high forest-clad mountains, the loftier summits of which are bare, and at this season covered with snow. During the day, forded the following rivers in succession : the Sarasun, Pul« i-Rud, Ganzarud, Lartijan, Manzarud, Sikarah- Eud, Husenabad, Usian, Mianden-Eud, Sarkhuni, Achirud, and the Turparu, besides 31 small name less streams, which were now mere trickling rills, though their dry beds were sometimes 20 yards across. Of the rivers just enumerated, the Pul- i-Rud, the Sikarah-Rud, the Miandeh-Eud and the Turparu are the largest; the summer bed of the last mentioned being about 230 yards broad. Road occasionally turned off the sands over turf half-covered with brushwood ; after about 7 farsakhs, came to the small village of Surmiru. 6 ZUYAII 20 • f • Crossing a small river of the same name, proceeded along the beach. Immediately after passing the river Sarmiru, the land between the shore and the mountains appeared to sink much lower than the level of the sea, and, with the exception of the invariable belt of forest along the coast most of the country was cleared and employed in rice cultivation. Grossed the following streams : the Bur-i-ghi, Nusaru, Kiarlaharu, Shir- i-Rud, Vanshak. Shahli Kalan, Mazar, Til-i-Eud, Ukilisar, and another. Of these the Shir-i-Rud is the largest and deepest; the Nusaru and the Kiarlaharu come next in size; but all are consi derable rivers in the summer, though at present they do not contain much water. Besides those mentioned, there were 16 smaller streams. After passing the Mazar, continued to Zuvar, a small village, 5 farsakhs from Sarimur. situated inland, about half a mile from the shore.335 No. 172— conid, R asht to A mul. No. of stage.

The scene here^ too, was changed ; instead of foam and breakers, the sea was calm as a mill-pond, and, save the occasional splash of some huge sturgeon gambol ling on the surface, not a ripple disturbed its tianquil bosom, which appeared like a vast sheet of glass. About 2 miles from the village, cross ed the river Izarud, where there is a fishery of the azadmahi, ami soon afterwards came to the banks of the Neshbarud. Thence the road goes to Abbasabad, about 7 miles from Zuvar, arriv ed at, after crossing the river Passandeh and another nameless stream. Continued along the sands in a direction E. by S. The day's march forded the following rivers, of which the Namakab-Rud is the largest; the Asp- i-Chi, Landzabad, Til-i-Rud, Palanga-Rud, Kal- arubad, Namak-Ab-Rud, Nao-Rud, Rud Pusht, Sard-Ab-Rud, Chalus, Karpamsa, besides 17 other small streams, some of which are probably bran ches from one or other of the larger rivers. After travelling 5^ farsakhs, arrived at the village of Karparu. Continued along the coast in mrch the same direc tion as last march. After crossing the rivers Manshallak and Musiabad, the mountains ap proached close to the shore; sometimes the road lay within the skirts of the woods, the ground of which was covered with flowers. Fordpd the Hari-Rud, Mazikar Rud and the Dnzdika Rud, the mouth of which was then choked by a sandbank, which had been thrown up by the late winds ; the waters, however, were collecting inside, and by their weight would very soon force a passage for themselves. A short distance from the shore, on the banks of this stream, is situated a large village called Kalentes. Some way farther on crossed, the river Aliabad, and during march passed over seven smaller rivulets, besides those named. Turned from the seashore to the village of Sarurdin Kala, situated some few hundred yards from the beach. Continued journey along the coast. From this point the mountains began gradually to recede from the shore, leaving a tract of low marshy land, which, at halting-place, whs from 15 to 20 miles broad, dotted with numerous villages, and(3) 83(1 No. 172— concld.

During march, the beach was more stony than usual* shelving »brUptly into the sea, which •^ppgared along this part ot the coast to be of greater depth than before. Cross the following streams, besides eight smaller, nameless ones. The Nimak-ab-Rud, the Kacharu, Alam-Rud, the Sulerdeh (dividing Kujur from Nur), the Rustam-Rud and the Izat Deh. First along a dry path parallel to the shore, through low bushes, but afterwards turning into the belt of forest proceeded towards the beach j no track was here visible, and the rain of the preceding night had so flooded the ground, which was of a soft boggy nature, that it was almost impassable. , Avoiding this obstacle and taking a devious path among the trees, reached seashore on the banks of the AUamrud. This river is the boundary between the district of Nur and Amul, and more inland it is called the Alisharud. The stream was deep, rapid, and dangerous from quicksands. The passage was accomplished, the water, how ever, running considerably above horses' girths. Continued march among low sand-hills, covered with dwarf oak, prickly shrubs, and medlar trees, for three or four miles, till the Haraz, on the opposite bank, of which the village of Mahmudabad is built. The river was about 30 yards broad, its bed was deep and the current rapid. The only method of crossing was in a boat, the horses swimming over. Turned inland through village of Mahmudabad, and proceeded a short distance farther over a swampy country, to village of Taligi-Sir. This was almost a continuation of Mahmudabad, houses being found nearly all along the road. The road (if one can possibly apply the term where there was really no road) lay wherever it was found most practicable, thiough a succession of swampy ricefields, interrupted occasionally by a mile or two of forest In several places encountered wide and deep ditches, crossed by narrow bridges formed of the trunks of a couple of trees, made so slippery by the rain and mud that they were unpleasant and dangerous both to horses and riders. At length arrived on a wide plain partly cultivated and partly covered with fern and brambles, in the midst of which Amul is situated. See Index.43 837 No. 173. S abzawah to K uchan.

General Report (Vatjghan). From Samnan to Bajistan, a distance of 401 miles, the route lies through sparsely populated tracts where water, though abundant enough at long intervals, is yet insufficient in all places for the requirements of troops. Supplies are scarce and totally inadequate to meet the supply of anything beyond the few caravans and solitary travellers who pass this way. The road, though unfit in its present state in a few places for guns, is a good one, and though it crosses several mountain ranges, the ascents and descents are so gentle that they form no serious obstacle, if the passes east of Duzai and north of Chah Pali be excepted. The greater part of the road runs over open gravel plains or along glacis-like slopes formed of the same materials which connect the hills with the Jcavir, To the south the Dasht-i-Kavirstretchesaway for miles, and though I examined it with the greatest caro and questioned many natives in the hope of find ing routes across it, there were only two that I saw or heard of—the route from Yazd to Dama- ghan via J andak, and the road I crossed north of Chashma Dubor, which was said to run direct from Anarak to Mashad.

For instance, Khar to the north of Reza is said to be a place of about 1,000 houses, and a centre of desert communications. From Bajistan to Jumain, 29J miles, the road is good ; water plentiful, and towns and villages, whence supplies might be drawn, are near the route. From Jumain to Nistafan near Rui Khaf the route appears to be fairly well watered, with the exception of Kalat Ali. The road is good but for the very difficult descent over the eastern slope of the Khaibar Kuh, Supplies are plentiful between Jumain and Nao- dehpeshan, but from thence until Nistafan is reached nothing is obtainable except sheep and goats. All other supplies would have to be carried. During the months of June, July and August the heat on this route is excessive. March, April and May are the best months for movements, when the climate is milder and the water-supply considerably larger. A vast sup ply of it might be obtained by the construction of dams and shallow tanks by which means shepherds maintain thousands of sheep for weeks together out in the desert during spring time, when grass and herbage abound everywhere except on the itself.

There is a standing dispute on this account be tween the Russians and Persians. At 4 or 5^ miles from Naurozabad is Sangar, near the Hari Rud Sangar contains sixty Seistani families. It has thirty ploughs and is irrigated by a canal from the Hari Rud, the head of which is about a mile above the village. Direct road to Pas Kamar leaves at 6 miles. Ca mels and mule transport sent this ^ way, and re ported good, and shorter by some miles than the way by Pul-i-Khatun. Pul-i-Khatun distant from Sangar about 16 miles. Latter part heavy, over sand. Sl^ir Tappa passed at a mile on left, the road not passing through it. The modern village is at the foot of the mound. It contains thirty families of Kermanis. It has twenty ploughs, and is irrigated by a canal from the Kashaf Rud. It formerly possessed a canal cut from the Hari Rud, but this is in disrepair owing to the river having washed away its head, which was cut at too acute an angle with the river. There is also an old hanat on its south side. Shir Tappa is close to the river. At Pul-i-Khatun the river was running strong but apparently fordable. At Pul-i-Khatun there seemed to be only two small one-storied barracks, one for the Cossacks, and one for the infantry. They did not seem capable of accommodating more than one hundred men each at the most. The Cossacks horses are under a rough shed of rough poles, with a thatch ed roof. The rest of the buildings seemed like895 No. 185.-— S arakhs to T urba.t-i -S hekh J am, vid Daolatahad, fyc. No. of itage. Namea of stages. Distahtces IN MItius. Interme diate.

On high bank a few hundred yards on road to Pas Kamar is an old caravansarai, which should be repaired and held by the Persians as an outpost. Road to Pas Kamar is perfectly easj', on right bank of Kashaf Rud, 4 miles from Pui- i-Khatun. Water and supplies at Pul-i-Khatun. Pas Kamar has one hundred and thirty families of Raotis (associated with Jamshedis)—twenty ploughs. Present Chief of Raotis, Haji Amin Khan. Raotis famish fifty-five sowars. All the Jamshedis have been removed from the frontier. Eaotis migrated from Derawat some generations ago. Pas Kamar is an important point. From it one road leads over Pas Kamar range to Zora- bad and Jam. Another road leads along the Ka shaf Rud to Akdar Band ; but this at present not used further than Shurja, being blocked with jungle and boulders. Shurja is cultivated by the Raotis. Supplies fairly plentiful. Fuel oi excel lent quality procurable from neighbouring hills, principally pistachio and juniper. Water ^plentiful from Kashaf Rud, and although brackish quite drinkable. Camping ground extensive and sandy soil. This place is also called Kala Muhammad Haji,. Timuri. There are a few black tents, and some mud houses. Water plentiful, and fuel procur able in the vicinity, and from hills. General direction southerly. First followed Kashaf Rud, and at 9 a. m . turned up Nari defile. Path quite an easy gradient, flanked on both (Nari) sides by high hills covered with pistachio trees. A dry (at this time) water-course filled with tamarisk bushes runs down through the defile. At 9^- reached Nari spring, water bitter. Elevation 1,400 feet aneroid. (Here a path branches off to Di- rakht-i-Anab in a westerly direction 2 (?) farsakhs distant with many ups and downs, but fit for lightly laden camels. A nab has one spring of sweet water, sufficient for two flocks of sheep (a flock one thousand or one thousand and five hun dred). Thence path goes to Kal-i-Farshami (1 far- sakh) and thence by easy road to Kul-i-Malikabad, 2 farsakhs. Here is a valley and spring not far from Natu on Mashad-Zorabad route. Kul -i- Malikabad has about twenty Seistani families; five ploughs. Near Malikabad, at a distance of 1 farsakh, is Bagh-i-Kashmiri.

This ascent is the only bit unfit for wheels, hut a good road could be made without difficulty. Reach plateau and about 2 hours afterwards, crest of pass. Elevation 2,400 feet (aneroid). The ouly difficulty is the short ascent just mentioned, but this could be avoided by following some of the ridges or nullahs to the east of present path, by which the Shorab plain could be reached, through which passes road to Burj-i-Khnda Bakhsh from Pul-i-Khatun. Prom the Shorab valley to top there is no difficulty. Descent on southern side easy : direct road goes to Chashma Timuri, but the Kal-i Kerao is a better camping-ground. Turned off to west at 12-20, and arrived in camp at 1-5 P.M. Milk and lucerne procurable; very little at Ohashma Timnri. This pass over the Pas Kamar range is generally known by the name Burj-i-Khuda Bakhsh. It presents no difficulty worth mentioning to construction of a road or rail way. A. direct road to it from Pul-i-Khatun, known as the Shorab route, as it passes through the Shorab plain above mentioned. General direction south-easterly. Follow course of the Kal-i-Kerao, bed of which contains tamarisk jungle and reeds, through which a sluggish brook flows. Passed at l^- hours a nullah on right a few hundred yards up which is Chashma Timuri. Here was a camp of Timuri black tents. Water- supply suffices for two or three thousand sheep, and enbugh to irrigate a yoke of land. Con tinued to follow windings of Kal-i-Kerao, which widens out between low clay hills, till 3 hours. Road good whole way. Two farsakhs on, nullah joins Hari Rud. This affords a good marching route towards Zorabad from frontier. Leaving the Kal-i-Kerao arrived at Zorabad at 12. At 1| miles from Zorabad crossed the Kushlaghar brook, the newly settled village of same name being abont 2 miles on right (west). About the Kerao nullah are a number of Nurzai shepherds from Herat, now under protection of the Nasrat- ul-Mulk. In all there are about four hundred families scattered between Zorabad, Bakharz and Khaf. People of Zorabad are called Urganjis. Number of families fifty ; twelve pairs of bullocks. They furnish twenty-four sowars. There are twelve artillerymen here, and two field guns with out horses.

Water, fuel and forage at Zorabad which is 7 miles from the river. (Macgregor). General direction south-west. Marched over Zorabad plain and at 3 miles passed ruins of old Zorabad, on conspicuous mound. Thence to Gusha Tut spring, about 3 miles ; water good with flowing water used for irriga tion. Thence to Karez Umar (not Zamma as in map N. W. F. Sheet 11 N. W.) crossing low hills about 3 miles. Here is abundant water of good quality, and a large encampment of black tents (Timuris). Thence to Karez Zamma (three ruins) 2 miles. Thence to Padah (willow) Jan Morad, 2 miles. Here is a fine spring of good water, with a good outflow for cultivation. At 2 miles passed ruins of Bini Tak (marked in map Nakdali, which guides said was several miles to the west) and at 2 miles camp at Burj-i-Kilich Khan. At Biri Tak comes in a road from Gushlaghar reported easy. At Bini Tak is a fine plain, which in older times was irrigated by a icanat Soil of the low hills said to be excellent. Timuris say that wheat of fine quality was formerly grown on them as rain crops. With the exception of a few ups and downs between Padah Jan Morad and the Bini Tak plain, load is perfectly easy for wheels even in its present state. Hills on north face well covered with trees, but not a stick at Kilich Khan. Pass is called Bini Tak from a high peak west of Kilich Khan camp, at the base of which goes a drivable road to Mahmudabad. This route was driven over by the Prince Rukn-ud- Daula this year, ]890. Snow on hills adjoin ing. There is a good spring at Burj -i-Kilich Khan used in spring and summer by Timuris. Fuel can be obtained by sending to the neighbour ing hills. General direction nearly south to Chashma Yakhak, and thence across the plain to Jam in a nearly south-westerly direction. Reached by easy ascent top of Bini Tak pass at 9J miles.

The other pass which goes to Mah- mudabad (see remarks last stage) is said, to be even easier. Passing the Yakhak spring at foot of descent arrived at Chashma (xul at \2i, Heie is a good supply of fairly ^ good water. Thence to Jam it is quite easy going over the plain. The village of Yakutan is passed at 3 miles from Jam. It has one hundred and twenty families of J amis. There are twelve yoke of oxen, and supplies of wheat, bnrley and lucerne procurable in con siderable quantities. The whole route from Pas Kamar to Jam (water and supplies) as above des cribed, apparently presents no difficulties of a serious nature to the construction of cart-road or railway. In winter none of the passes are closed except occasionally during the actual progress of a snow-storm.

Camp on left bank of canal, which is here some 50 yards broad and about 9 feet deep. Road passed through Kala-i-nao, a good sized village. Thence the road crosses the gravelly plateau till arrival here. We passed a large extent of inundated ground on our left most of the way. From Khwaja Ahmad to the Bandi-i-Sistan is four miles. Khwaja Ahmad consists, it is said, of some 300 wattle and daub huts scattered about on the banks of the canal. Road ran almost the whole way down left bank o£ river, through tamarisk. We passed on our way ruins of Shahristan, said to be situated on an island between two branches of the canal and quite uninhabited ; a little to the north was the village of Sharifabad. To our right front on the opposite bank are the ruins of Nad-i-Ali consisting of three mounds. This is the last village on this side of the Chilin- gak district; some three miles out we came to the first branch of the river; here a strong running stream, some 60 yards broad and 5 and 6 feet deep. All the baggage had to be crossed over in two tutins. The horses and mules were swum across by the Turkoman sowars. The camels with tents were able to cross at a ford, some 300 yards below, where the water just came up to their saddles. For the next seven miles road led through dense tamarisk jungle, with small hamlets and clear ings every here and there. Camp pitched on left bank of second branch of the river, which here runs between very low banks: supplies from Milak. From the crossing place I rode first some three miles up the right bank of the stream to the bund known (as far as I could ascertain) as the Band-i-Afghan. Along the old bed of the river, there now flows from the bund a stream only some 20 or 30 yards wide and three or four feet deep. About two miles down the left bank of the latter we came to the small Afghan village of the Deh-i-Do situated on the right bank under some padah trees.

Beyond Karkun we found tbe whole country under water. Tbe stream beyond Karkan was up to tbe men's necks at tbe ford. Road from Karkun to Lash Juwain said to be always closed by water during flood season in spring and summer, when people cross in tutins, but to be dry in autumn and summer as a rule: it is said to run from Karkun across tbe river to Takhta Pul, thence to Deb Darwesb Muhammad, Eata- mak.

Jalalabad, which lies about a mile to W., is surrounded by water, and the crops both here and there have mostly been destroyed. Supplies bad to be collected from other villages. A very hard day's march. First we had about a mile of water to wade through to village of Jalalabad, in the mud of which many of the camels stuck and fell. Beyond the village again was more than half a mile of deeper water still, too deep for tbe mules to get through loaded, and all the baggage had accordingly to be put on the camels.

The two villages here- contain some 40 families of Berberi settlers, and also Persians from Jam and Khaf, who between them cultivate 24 ploughs of land. Supplies plen tiful and water good. The villages are the private property of the Nusrat-ul-Mulk. Road was mostly level as far as Farahgird, at the 10th mile; thence turning to the left it passes across undulating ridges till the village of Maragha is reached. Farahgird consists of several villages with a conical mound, surmounted by some old buildings in the centre. It belongs to the shrine at Mashad. Maragha and the next village, Sang-i-Atish, now contain about 100 families of Berberi cultivators, who have 24 ploughs of land. Supplies scarce ; water good from a spring. At Maragha we were told there were two roads.. The upper one through the hills, whicb was said to be difficult for baggage animals, and the lower one via Kula Bakhsh. We chose the latter. The road ran down the bed of the stream tor some distance and then turning off to the lett, passed the village of Asasur and on across an opett plain to Kula Bakbsh, distant about 11 miles.ROUTES IN PERSIA, SECTION III.

It stands on a nearly level plain, irrigated to a very small extent, and barren enough to appear ance elsewhere, but capable of producing fine crops of wheat with sufficient and seasonable rain. There are no gardens or vineyards to screen the village, and the mud houses are of one single storey, with a small enclosure for cattle. The whole covers a small extent of ground^ and could not be held for half an hour against a force provided with guns.

The following general description of the little known country between Lailan and Sangar may enable one the better to appreciate the military features of the above route :— The first 30 rDiIes is tolerably level and' the road' gocd ; but after leaving Sain Ka'a and the valley of the Jagbatu, there is a stretch of 35 miles of rough country as far as the village of Genja Kishlak, with one narrow defile along the bank of Xaurachai, a tributary of the Jaghatu. The total ascents amount to 3,900' and descents to 2,700'. From Genja Kishlah an open valley is followed up to the watershed line. Persian troops with guns have several times passed along the route, making good stages. The hills are low and of easy slopes, destitute of vegetation, save a scanty herbage. The valleys open, abundantly watered, fertile, and well cultivated. In winter and spring, the valley of the Jaghatu is ex tensively inundated; communioation is carried on, between the villages on either bank, by boats. At such times the road on the hillskirt becomes difficult, but never impassable. But little snow460 No, 211—contd. T abriz fo K armanshah, via Binao, Lallan^ fyc. D istances im' milks. Kc. of Names of stages. St ge. Interme diate. Total. falls in the valley itself. The higli plateaux about Mahi Bulak are covered with snow for two or three' months, and impassable often for several days. Caravans pass over the snow when hardened, the gradients, being everywhere, easy. The villages of the Afshar district are small, for the most part mere hamlets. They number about 100 in all, with an average of 20 houses, giving a popula tion of 10,000 souls. There are also abtmfc 20O tents of nomads. The villagers are Kurds and Turks with a.few Afshars, to which tribe also the Khan belongs. Grain is X -)roduced in sufficient quantity to supply the wants of the district, but there is little surplus. Forage and fuel would be found in the villages in considerable quantities and water is of course everywhere abundant. Carriage is not procurable. Camels are neither kept nor reared, though the country seems in every way fitted for them, and there are but few mules. From Kizil Bulak to Khusharabad, a distance of 60 miles, the route lies through the district of Gerus. The small stream, on which Kizil Bulak stands, winds through a broken tract of hills of easy outline and destitute of vegetation. As far as Khushmakam, 9 miles, the road follows the windings of the stream. At this point the vallej opens out into the valley of the Kizil Uzan, tree less and seemingly barren, but having a good soil, yielding fine crops even on large tracts not irrigated. Crossing this plain, a rough tract of mountain, known as the xik Dagh,is traversed. The worst portion of it, that beyond Kara Bulak, may be turned by aline which has been followed by Persian guns, striking off from Kara Bulak eastward to the village of Kuska Gul, 4 miles dis tant, thence down an easy slope to the Kizil Uzan, and up its open level bed till the caravan road is rejoined near the bridge of Salamatabad, a detour of 10 to 12 miles at most. The passes of Nasir- abad and Salamatabad offer, however, no serious obstacles to the passage of a lightly equipped force, or to the construction of a permanent military road. The total ascents and descents up to Kara Bulak are 625 feet and 200 feet, respectively, and from Kara Bulak to the level of the Kizil Uzan is a fall of 900 feet. The first portion is quite prac ticable for the passage of guns, and the second might be made so with some little labour. The Kizil ITzan is crossed by a sound stone bridge.

Total, narrow point below the bridge, lias a width of over 200 paces, and carried a stream in the driest season, November, of about 60 feet section, flowing at 2 or 3 miles per hour. For four months of the year, in spring and early summer, it isunfordable everywhere. From the river bank is a long easy ascent of 1,500 feet in 10 miles to the town of Bijar, which lies hidden in a cluster of precipitous heights, the culminating points of an extensive area of plateau country. The caravan route from the town of Bijar lies through a narrow defile known asthe Tang-i-Kalija, and up a rough glen on to the southern slopes of the plateau. The road is tortuous, and the rock, which crops out J^i'eely, a hard limestone ; but the whole length of the pass, known as the Gardan-i-Alakabut, is so short and the gradients so easy, that a road might be made at no great cost of labour. The total ascents and descents from the town to the south slope of the plateau are 600 feet and 600 feet respectively. The pass may be turned by a long detour of 12 to 15 miles by the villages of Kara Bulak and M ok alia. The artillery of the Shah's escort have come horsed to Bijar by this route. From the pass of Alakabut is an easy; undulating country, offering no serious obstacles as far as Khasrabad, the last village of Gerus. The higher portions of the district are subject to a heavy snowfall, impeding traffic, and frequently closing the road for many days. The town of Bijar is often completely isolated. From Khushrabad to Sera Agatch on the borders of the province of Karmanshah a portion of Kurdistan, known as the Manal-i-Ishfandabad, is traversed. The distance, 23 miles, is over an undulating and very practicable country. A large tributary of the Kizil Uzan. known as the Kachigird orTalwar Rud, is crossed, but, though unbridged, it is said to offer no obstacle save at times of high flood. There are but a few small villages along the route, and the surface of the country is destitute of trees, and has but scanty- vegetation. The complete absence of wood in these tracts and in the neighbouring mountains is evidenced by the appearance of the villages, the houses of which are all dome-roofed, resemb ling at a distance clusters of beehives. The dis trict numbers 60 villages, of which three only— Sarishabad, Kurba on the high road, andLailan— have over 100 houses. The average of the whoW46^ No. 211— con id.

A good deal of grain is exported thence to Hamadan, local prices bein'- somewhat higher than at Bijar, but less than half the current rate at hfaniadan, distant only two day's journey. Carriage is, as elsewhere on the route, scarce ; mules may be procured in the villages, but not in large numbers. Four miles beyond Sera Agatch is a high rocky range, which divides the drainage basins of the Kizil Uzan and Tigris, and forms also the boundary lines of the province of Karmanshah. The crest of this ridge is crossed by the route at a low point known as the Gardan-i-Girdakanu, which is marked from , a distance of many miles by the ICuh Panja, a precipitous three-peaked elevation in the range. From the pass of Girdakanu to Besitun, on the high road between the capital and Baghdad, is a distance of about 56 miles, for the most part over a very broken mountainous country, more difficult than any yet traversed bv the route, but still practicable for any force with any description of carriage. The ridge of Girda kanu once crossed, the wh^le aspect of the country is changed ; lofty rugged mountains flecked with snow, green valleys, winding streams and villages with ample orchards and vineyards tike the place of the bare slopes and barren rocks of the Kizil Uzan valley. Of the 56 miles from Girdakanu to Besitun, 17 only are level plain. The,total ascents amount to 2,000 feet, and the descents to 3,300. The pass of Girdakanu, which is gained by an ascent of 1,000 feet, is rugged and steep, and commanded by heights difficult of access, but might, with no great amount of labour, be made passable for guns. It may also be turned, by a detour of about 20 miles, by another pass to the west of Kuh Panja. Fourteen miles from Girdakanu, the Gawarud, an affluent of the Tigris, reaching the plain below Zohab, is crossed. Thence is a long ascent and descent over the shoulder of a remarkable mountain known as Mahin Kuh. No better pass into the valley of^ Sangar exists, and though steep, it might, without difficulty, be made practicable for guns. Crossing the beautiful valley of San gar, a third pass, the Gardan-i-Mulawas, leading into the valley of a large affluent of the Tigris, is reached. This is said to be also the easiest pass from Sangar to Karman- shah, and the formation of the range on either side bears out the statement. Though rugged463 No. 211— eonid.

Total. - • • it is by no means a serious obstacle ; guns might cross it in its present state, and a Utile labour would render it easilv practicable. At the foot of the pass lies the little valley of Dinawar, and opposite to it frowns a precipitous, impracticable- looking range of mountains, which seems to fairly bar all further progress to the south, but through the heart of which is poured, neverthe less, the whole drainage of many hundred square miles of country, and lies the best road into the plain of Karmanshah. The plain of Dinawar, draining from the south and west, sends two considerable streams to the foot of the imposing wall of rock, where joining they find exit through the Tang or defile of Dinawar, a cleft in a great mass of mountains. Winding for 7 miles be tween towering precipices, the open valley of Chamchamar is reached. Across the mouth of the valley runs the high read from Tehran and the telegraph line. The defile of Dinawar, though affording an excellent passage through a very impracticable mass of mountains, would be difficult to traverse in the face of any deter mined opposition; its flanks for many miles being inacc.'ssible, and when accessible so flanked by steep scarps as to be nearly impracticable to direct assault. A detour of about 20 to 30 miles from Dinawar, east over a low pass, crossed with ease by horsemen and laden camels to Shana, a station on the high-road, turns the defile. The province of Karmanshah may be termed the granary of Persia, and, except in seasons of extreme scarcity, the country might be relied on, to supply a very large force in all that would be necessary, to enable it ta traverse the barren tracts beyond. Mules, camels, and horses are owned and bred in large numbers, and corn and forage are plentiful. Notes on the topography and resources of the dis- tricts through which the caravan route from Tabriz to Karmanshah lies. On the map of Persia, issued from the Survoyor- (reneral's Office in India, Karmanshah lies about 300 miles south of Tabriz, both fixed points. The caravan route follows a somewhat longer line, which is deflected to the west by a mass of moun tains lying south-east of Tabriz, known as the Kuh-i-Sahend, from a prominent peak, and again to the east by the Jaghatu river, the upper course of which it follows as the easiest line.464 No. 211— contcL Tabriz to Karma^sfiah, vid Binah, Lallan, fyc.

There are few villages within the mountainous tract dominated by the Sahand peak, and the pasturage is poor. The plain is fertile, but somewhat scantily watered, the small streams following from !?a,hand. being almost entirely consumed in the irrigation of vineyards and orchards. The large villages, Khusrushah (1,000 houses)^ Ilkhiji (300 houses), Mamaghan (500 houses), Dakhara- gan (800 houses), and Gengan (1,000 houses), having in all 3,600 houses, representing a popu lation of 18,000, do not grow corn sufficient for their own consumption. This apparently has long been the condition of agri culture in the district, but of late years a large demand for dried fruits for foreign export has stimulated the production of fruit and rendered the villagers even more than formerly dependent on external supplies of grain. Probably not more than an average of a month s supply per family would be found in the villages at any time of the year, and in summer much less. This also would be available only at a very high price or by prompt requisition. Forage would be even more difficult to procure on the spot in large quantities. As in other parts of Persia, little, save chopped straw, is used. In autumn and early winter there would be a consi derable quantity found stored in the villages the winter supply of owners of cattle at other times very little. In spring and early summer unlimited pasturage would be found along the edge of the lake basin. Firewood may be procured in large quantities from the gardens and plantations. Carriage is almost unprocurable, save to very small extent-there being but few nomads, and the export trade being carried on mostly by carriers from Tabriz. Water is everywhere procurable, either in the small streams flowing from Sahand, or by digging at 3k depth of 10 to 15 feet. It is reputed of good quality.59 465 No. 211— contd* T abriz to K armanshah, vi 4 j Binah, Lailany Distances ik miles. No. of Names of stageg. stage. Interme diate. Ebmibes. Total. The appearance of the people bears testimony in favour of the climate. Gengan to Binah. —Between Gengan and Binab, a distance of 33f miles, which may be termed the second section of the route, the western ramifica tions of Kuh Sahand—rough low spurs of lime stone and slate projecting into Lake Urumia— are crossed. Of the 83J miles, 18f miles are level plain, and 15 miles hilly ground. The highest point reached is about 450 feet above the lake. The sum of the several ascents of the ridgos intervening is 600 feet, and of the descents the same. In no cases is the gradient of even the present track so steep as to prevent guns or carts being driven. It is unlikely that any preferable alternative road would be found to the right or left. The hills are entirely destitute of wood, and of easy outline. There are many extensive plateaux and gentle slopes, cultivated without irrigation. The plain, at a distance of a mile or two from the water's edge, and thence to the hillskirt, is ex ceedingly well watered, fertile, and well cultivat ed. The whole extent, varying from 1 mile to 12 miles in width, is however small, and its grain produce insufficient to support the large population. Grain is imported from the districts north, and from Khamsa to the south-east. As in the Dakharagan tract, the villagers support themselves for the most part by the production and sale of fruit, which is dried and exported in large quantities to Russia. Including Maragha, the chief town of the district, which is estimated to have 2,500 houses, and Binab, which has 2,000, there are 4,0 to 50 large villages on the plain and hillskirts, having an - average probably of not less than 150 houses each, which gives a population of 30,000 to 35,000 souls. A description of one of those villages will suffice, for all exist under the same conditions, and are alike undefended. The inhabited portion of the village is commonly a mere kernel, enclosed in a dense mass of vineyards and orchards. Each house forms a portion of a small block divided off by narrow ill-paved lanes—never as much as 20 feet broad and often less than 10 feet. Each has a central court or yard, a high wall and strong gate facing the lane, and high walls on the othftr three sides ; beyond the court is usually a small patch of gardens.466 No. 211— contd* T abriz to K armanshah, via Bin ah, Lallan, fye.

The walls of all are built entirely of mud. which becomes nearly as hard as stone. With a v double storey, the elevation is about 20 feet, the lower walls three feet thick, upper two feet, the roof flat, with six beams of poplar vary ing in length from ten to fifteen feet covered with a thin layer of mud. A parapet wall of mud bullet-proof, runs round each roof. Such build ings would afford no protection against shot, but would be difficult to fire, and little or no wood being exposed, fire would rot spread rapidly. Houses, or more properly shops, in the bazaar— 4 the principal street of the village—are built on a different plan, that is, covering much less ground, but of the same materials. The vineyards or orchards—in local parlance always gardens—ex tend for more than a mile around the larger vil lages, being thickest above and below on the line of irrigation. They cover from two to about ten acres of ground, are thinly planted, and enclosed by solid mud walls of twelve to fifteen feet high, with a single small gate. Narrow lanes and watercourses wind through and about them, affording a very in different means of communication. Thcugh the height of the garden walls, and the thinness of the cover within them detract from their defen sive value, they might, with some little labour, be converted into an excellent screen, very difficult to penetrate in the face of even undisciplined op position. In respect to forage, the tract about Binab and between that town and Maragha is better suppli ed than the last, but the pastures are of less extent. Fuel is plentiful, and water is easily procured. Carriage in any quantity is not to be found. There are no large droves of camels, and but few mules. Near to Binab the road traverses a mud' flat—a depression in the plain, some two miles in width— that would, form a serious obstacle to the passage of guns or waggons. A causeway has been raised across it, which is in process of being, roughly paved, not by the local authorities or even by the villagers, but by the labour of an aged mendicant, possessing a single donkey to transport himself and his paving stones ! The morass—a term the flat is said fully to deserve in winter—may be turned by a long detour over a rough hillskirt.4G7 No. 21 \~~'Contd. T abriz io K armanshah, via Binah&gt; Lai Ian, fyc.

To the left of the road are low hills, to the right, a plain, stretching away for 20 to 30 miles to Myandab, a large village of the Suj Bulak district, and to the foot of the range separating Myandab from Suj Bulak. On a small tributary of the Jaghatu, dry in autumn, is the considerable village of Maiikandi with some eight or ten others, having large gardens and wide tracts of corn land in cultivation. At Myandab, grain is said to be abundant. Maiikandi is the last large village, with the ex ception of Bijar, that is to be found on the route till the province of Karmanshah is reached. Along the route, and about the eastern portion of the feuj Bulak district, are a considerable num ber of nomad camps, from which camels might be procured. In summer, the camps would be found further east in the mountains. In the village of Suj Bulak, and nowhere else in the length and breadth of Persia, there are many rough two-wheeled carts, adapted however only for use in the plain. Forage, equally with grain, would be procurable in large quantities in the western portion of the district. Water is scarce only in the barren tracts to the east. The only natural fuel procurable on the route after leaving Maiikandi, till the valley of the Jaj;hatu is reached, is a small thorny shrub found on the plain, which serves well for the purpose, but is difficult to collect. / In the ' Kishlaks ' or winter campsof the nomads, large quantities,of this fuel and also of ' Tapala,'* or cakes of camels' dung, may be found collected during autumn and early winter. The village of Lailan is a fair type of the villages on the elevated portion of the district. It.stands on a nearly level plain, irrigated to a very small extent, and barren enough to appearance else where, but capable of producing fine crops of wheat with sufficient and seasonable rain. There are no gardens or vineyards to screen the village, and the mud houses are of one single storey, with a small enclosure for cattle. The whole covers a small extent of ground, and could not be held for half an hour against a force pro vided with guns.468 No. 211— contd.

District of Gerus. —The district of Gerus, one of the hereditary chiefships of Western Persia, covers a large area between the districts of Kham- sahand Kurdistan, and the provinces of Azarbai- jan and Karmanshah. The surface is broken by the drainage of the Kizil Uzan into a number of wide level plateaux, culminating at one central point in rocky elevations, and round their edges, falling abruptly in a labyrinth of ravines to the drainage level. The valleys and glens are well-watered and fertile, but their area bears a very small proportion to the whole. The extensive plateaux are almost desti tute of vegetation and barren to all appearance, but have an excellent soil, and with seasonable rains bear large crops of wheat and barley. As much as fifteen-fold is commonly stated to be yielded under favourable conditions. The rocky elevations and the unplonghed portions of the plateaux afford pasturage, seemingly poor in quality, but of unlimited extent. Various computations place the number of villages at about 500, with an average of 30 houses each. For the most part they are small, there being but two, Khasrabad and Najafabad, of over 100 houses f These have about 300 each, and Bijar, 1,500. Hence the population may be roughly estimated at 80,000 to 85,000 souls. Kurds, Turks and Persians— that is, clans speak ing Persian but of obscure origin—are found in about equal proportions. To the south and west the Kurdish element predominates, to the north the Turkish.469 No. 211— contd. Tabriz to Karmanshah, vid Bhmh ) Lailan, tyc. No. of stage. Names of stages. Distances ix miles.

The revenue of the district, estimated at about 12,000 tomans=£4,800, is assigned to the Chief, who furnishes to the Shah's army one regiment of 800 men and 350 artillerymen—for the most part in the Turkish villages. Bejar. —Bejar, the chief town, is curiously situat ed in a hollow surrounded by barren peaks, ris ing at several points to about 1,000 feet. Even in former times the position could not have been a strong one, for it is open on two sides. It has no defences save a weak wall enclosed, but not effectively screened, by large gardens. The 5,000 or 6,000 inhabitants are occupied chiefly in agri culture. Save a few carpets nothing is manufac tured. The high elevation of its site entails the disadvantages of a rigorous winter and a scanty water-supply ; it was, no doubt, selected in troubl ed times when the level fertile banks of the Kizil Uzan were trampled by hostile bands of Tartars or Kurds. The villages of Bejar are usually without gardens, and stand in the centre of extensive tracts of plateau land ploughed for corn. The quantity of land owned by each village is so extensive that a crop is grown only every third year on the same land. The average yield of wheat on such lands is calculated at five-fold. Ordinarily, the gross produce of the district is said not to exceed, to any large extent, the local re quirements. The adjoining tracts to the east and north being sufficiently well provided to supply the local wants atZindjan, Kasvm and Hamadan, and consequently to put a limit to production in Bejar. But after a good harvest a considerable surplus would certainly be available. The price of wheat in November 1875 (a good year) was 10 krans or rupees four per kharwar of about 600 lbs., or barley fths of that of wheat; while paid in kind, that is as harvest wagps, or in satis faction of cash assignments, the value of a khar war of wheat was only from five to^seven krans. The only exportable product of the district is sheep, which are kept in large flocks on the upland pas tures and the wastes surrounding the cultivated lands. They are taken to Kasvin and as far as Tehran. Their s^le pays t for imports, that is, supplies the peasantry with the few articles of foreign make that they require. Forage may be procured in large quantities, and in spring there are a few fine pastures about the head-waters of the Kizil Uzan.470 No. 211— contd. T abriz to K armanshah, via Bin ah, Lailan, fyc.

Fuel is more scarce perhaps than elsewhere on the- route, the people depending on dried camel-thorn and small stores of the ' Tapala ' before men^ tioned. Beasts of bnrden of all descriptions are almost unprocurable, and the fact is remarkable, for the country seems peculiarly fitted fo^ rearing eamels. There are no nomads save a few tents of Shah's J^evend, and few mules or borses are bred in the villages. In tbe district of Khamsa, lower- down the course of Kizil Uzan, camels are to be found in considerable numbers, there being a large and constant export of grain thence.. From Khasiabad to Sar Agatch on the borders of the province of Karmanshah a portion of Kur-- distan known as the Mehal-i-Ishfandabad is traversed. The distance, 23 miles is over an undulating and very practicable country. A large tributary of the Kizil Uzan, known as the Ketchigird or Talsvar Kud, is crossed, but, though unbridged, it is said to oifer no obstacle save at times of high flood. There are but a few small villages along the route,, and the surface of tbe country is destitute of trees, and has but scanty vegetation. The com plete absence of wood in these tracts and in the neighbouring mountains is evidenced by the- appearance of the villages, the houses of whicb are all dome-roofed, resembling at a distance clusters of beehives. The ' mahal,' or district, numbers 60 villages, of' which three only—Sarishabad, Kurba, on the. high road, and Lailan—have ov^er 100 houses. The average of the whole is, from 20 to 30 houses. A good deal of grain is exported thence to Hama- dan, local prices being somewhat higher than at Be jar, but less than half the current rate at, Hamadan, distant only two days' journey. Carriage is, as elsewhere on the route,scarce ; mules may be procured in the villages, but not in large- numbers. Four miles beyond Sara Agatch is a high rocky range which divides the drainage basins of the Kizil Uzan and Tigris,, and forms also the bound-, ary lines of the province of Karmanshah. The crest of this ridge is crossed by the route at a low point known as the Gardan-i-Girdakanu, which is marked from a distance of many miles, by the KuhPanja, a precipitous three-peaked elevation in the range.Wi 471 No. 211— contd.

From tKe pass of Girdakanu to Besitun, on the high road between the capital and Ba^hdadi, is a distance of about 56 miles, for the most part over a very broken mountainous country, more diffi cult than any yet traversed by the route, but still perfectly practicable for any force with any des cription of carriage. The ridge of Girdakanu once crossed, the whole aspect of the country is changed ; lofty rugged mountains flecked with snow, green valleys, wind ing streams, and villages with ample orchards and vineyards take the place of the bare slopes and barren rocks of the Kizil TJzan valley. Of the 56 miles of this section of the route 17 miles only are level plain. The total ascents amount to &lt;3,000 feet, and the descents to 8,300 feet. The pass of Girdakanu, which is gained by an ascent of 1,000 feet, is rugged and steep, and commanded by heights difficult of access, but might with no great amount of labour be made passable for guns. It may also be turned, by a detour of about 20 miles, by another pass to the west of Kuh Panja. Fourteen miles from Girdakanu the Gawa Rud— an affluent of the Tigris reaching the plain below Zohab—^is crossed. Thence is a long ascent and descent over the shoulder of a remarkable tabular mountain, known as Mahin Kuh. No better pass into the valley of Sangar exists, and though steep it might without difficulty be made practic able for guns, the soil of the mountain slope be ing almost uniformly of good depth and soft. Crossing the beautiful valley of Sangar, a third pass—the Gardan-i-Milawas, leading into the valley of a large affluent of the Tigris—is reached^ This is said to be also the easiest pass from San- gar to Karmanshah, and the formation of the range, on either side, bears out the statement. Though rugged, it is by no means a serious obstacle; guns might cross it in its present state, and a little labour would render it easily practicable. At the foot of the pass lies the little valley of Dinawar, and opposite to it frowns a precipitous, impractic able-looking range of mountains, which seem to fairly bar all further progress to the south, but through the heart of which is poured, neverthe less, the whole drainage of many hundred square miles of country, and through which lies the best road into the plain of Karmanshah.472 No, 211 — con tel.

The plain of Dinawar draining from the south and t , west sends two con- Defile of Dmawair. &gt; » , i giderable streams to the foot of the imposing wall of rock, where joining, they find exit through the Tang or defile of Dinawar, a cleft in a great mass of mountains formed by some gigantic effort of nature^ probab ly subsequent to the formation of the mountains themselves. From a distance the indentations of the two flanks of the defile are seen to correspond exactly— 4 each salient being opposed by a re-entering angle of equal depth—on the hit hand side the strata are inclined at a sharp angle, appearing to have fallen away from the opposite mass by the subsidence of the earth's crust beneath. Wmding for 7 miles between towering preci pices the open valley of Chamchamar is reached. Across the mouth of the valley runs the high road from Tehran and the telegraph line. The Dinawar stream joined by the Gamas-ali, and further on by the Kara Su from Karmanshah, flows south into a mountain defile, a repetition on a smaller scale of the grand chasm it has just cleared. The defile of Dinawar, though affording an excel lent passage through a very impracticable mass of mountains, would be difficult to traverse in the face of any determined opposition ; its flanks for many miles being inaccessible, and when accessible so flanked by steep scarps as to be nearly im practicable to direct assault. A detour of about 20 to 30 miles from Dinawar east over a low pass, crossed with ease by horse men and laden camels, to Sena, a station on the high road, turns the defile. The district of Sanghur, which commences at Gir- dakanu, consists of two valleys, that of the Gaowi Rud, undulating and bare, showing a few villages and large stretches of excellent corn land; and that of the fehaja Rud—in which lies the town of Sanghur-—level, well-watered and covered with villages, gardens and plantations. There are said to be in all, including hamlets in the mountains, 153 villages, of which 20 have 100 houses and upwards. The average of the whole is about 30 houses. ^ The people raise and export considerable quantities of grain chiefly to Hama- dan and the barren tracts beyond.

It numbers 2,000 houses and 40 shops. Unlike most other towns in Persia, it has no ruined quar ter—the famine, though felt, has left no perma nent traces. The inhabitants, almost entirely engaged in agri culture, export their corn, fruit, and a few carpets made by their women. The Kurdish nomads of the district, having the command of extensive pastures, rear large num bers of small hardy horses and mules. Forage and fuel are plentiful. The district or petty chiefship—for it is held by an hereditary chief—of Dinawar has about 80 villages and hamlets, lying in the picturesque, fertile valleys of the two streams, the Kangar- shah and Jannisar, that unite at the defile. Their chief estimates the surplus grain produce at about 6,000 k bar wars or 2,800 tons. It now finds its way chiefly to Hamadan. A consider able number of horses and mules might be found in the district, and fuel and forage in large quan tities. Then ' mahal' of Chamchamar, on which the defile of DinavAar opens, is exceedingly beautiful and fer tile. It is traversed by the windings of the Dina war stream, the banks of which are well wooded; its villages are enclosed in gardens and plantations of tall forest trees ; and its soil, when not cul tivated, is covered with a luxuriant natural vege tation. It numbers about 80 villages with an average of about 40 houses each. One-fourth of the soil is abundantly irrigated, and the dry or £&lt; daima ' lands bear excellent crops. The surplus grain produce is estimated at 24,000 kharwars or 8,800 tons, of which one-fifth is barley. Of the ' mahals ' or districts of Karmanshah, Chamchama is by no means the most productive. The province may, in fact, be termed the granary of Western Persia. A rough estimate, made by several natives, of the surplus produce of the province gives a total of 380,000 kharwars or 139,333 tons of wheat and barley as ready to be 60 m.474 No. 211— conoid.

The road gradually descends from Kizil Kapan into a valley.

It was rather swollen by the late rains, but the depth was not more than 83 in the middle, and the width about 16 yards. Then passed the villages of Xendi and SnlaK, and turning north over a low hill, approached Namin, about 7 miles distant trom Ardabil. Namin is a very pretty village situated in a small valley at the foot of the mountains which divide the upper country from the low lands of Talish (Holmes), Todd passed two villages, which he calls Namin and Namm north. The former 15 miles from Ardabil on the right bank of the Karasu, which is there forded, and which forms the boundary between Ardabil and Valkhi, but contains very little water, except in spring, when it is a con- siderable stream. Namin north is the residence of MirKazim Khan chief of Velki, Astara and Ujarud and lies north 45° east 5 miles of Namin. it is situated in a ravine descending from the mountains to the north-east. These mountains aie called Shindan, are distant about 4 miles, and reach, according to Colonel Monteith, a height of 7 ' ( ?9V abo ™ the sea. Between Now- ahdeh and Isamm, four villages on the right and nght front, the road turns to the west. From tne map 15 miles appears correct. The great discrepancy in the distances given by the two travellers may be explained by the custom prevailing in son.e parts of the east of calling the various groups of dwelling, situated in the same rayon by the same name. On quitting Namin, 1 mile to the south-east is the village of Daderan, whence the road turns east by north, leaving the Khan Agha on the right, and, crossing the brow of a hill sprinkled with underwood passes within about half a mile ot Mount Shindan, a perpendicular rock, which marks the south-west point of Russian Talish. i ^rom this point the road descends through thick wood, scarcely passable at this season from mud and melting snow.

Near the mouth of the Karghan- rud is another Russian fishing station, of 5 or 6 huts, immediately after which the road turns to the west and ascends by the side of the river, through the forest, for some 3 miles to the village of the same name, which is on both banks of the stream. The houses are scattered amongst half-cleared thick wood and rice cultivation. Returned by narrow pathway through forest to the sea-shore.

Thence to Amul the track runs north beside the Haras, over un- dnlating country, well cultivated with rice. Canals numerous but shallow, and fields slightly fenced. The Haras or Haras-chai has a good sound gravelly bed, and is fordable everywhere, except after spring floods. Country descends to within 5 or 6 miles of Amul. Canals make it difficult to cross. The banks of river are high and well wooded. Ouseley says of that stage For first 3 miles road runs in bed of stream, on over short pieces of causeway, in places not more than 3 or 4 feet broad, cut in steps on the side of the hill, and formed of layers of wood and stone placed on deep clay, the natural soil of the hill. This causeway is almost impassable to horsemen and laden mules, and is fast .falling into utter decay. Commencing at the third mile, there is a stretch of this kind for 2 miles on left bank. The hills commence to be wooded 2 miles after leaving Parnsp. The remains of an ancient and more substantial road, built up against the solid rock on the other side of the stream, are visible, and are probably the work of Shah Abbas ; but earth-quakes and torrents have nearly destroyed it, and travellers prefer the modern causeway although the distance by it is greater. At 5 miles the valley through which the stream flows to the plain expands to 400 yards, and road pro ceeds down bed of stream in northerly direction. At 11 miles stream emerges from valley, and 5 miles beyond Amul is reached. # # »492 No. Vil—contd Tehran to Astrabat^ vx &amp; Jmul, Barfarusk, Sari and Ashraf. No. of stage. Names of stages.

Notes on the road from Tehran to Astrabad, vi&amp; the Lar Valley, FiruzJcuJi and Khinq plateau. From Tehran two roads may be taken to the Lar Valley, one via the Afche Pass; the other the Levasnn Pass. Thus Tehran. Tehran. Afche Levasun. Lar (Yurt Khandla Khan). Lar (Yurt Khandla Khanl These roads are locally well known and are of no special importance beyond the former beipo^ largely used by caravans carrying coal from the mines in the Lar Valley. The Afche is a difficult pass, consisting mostly of rocky ledges and loose rubble, specially from the south side. The Levasnn Pass and route, though said to be longer, is very much easier and the snow clears earlier in the year. Phalour, the 3rd March, practically marks the limit of the Lar Valley and is a name given to a small amount of cultivation on the slopes of the valley of Imam Fadeh Hashim, only worked during the summer months from Rehna, at other times untenanted. (No supplies are available.) It is a plane of some importance as commanding four valleys.— (1) The northern, along which the Lar drainage flows to the sea. (2) The southern, or valley of Imam Fadeh Hashim, leading to the town of Demar- end and the plains of Veramin. (3) The western, leading to the Lar pastures. . (4) The eastern, leading to Firuzkuh, commonly known as the Ghazom -tnai Valley. . L , This valley of the Ghazan-Chai to Firuzkuh is that followed in the present report. The road is easy, and fair village supplies are available. ... +1^ Firuzkuh, small well-watered oasis amid the barren mountains, is^ of importance as point on which caravan traffic from Tehran and Semnan converges on its way to Mazanaarun and Mashad-i-Sar on the Caspian.499 The main caravan route from Tehran runs by Jajirud, Sultanabad, Firuz Kuh, Do-aB^ olurga, etc., to Mashad-i-Sar, vide Routs (1), that from Samnan joins the above at Firuz- knh. From Firuzkuh the lateral road to Astrabad, via Fulhad Maialla, Chabardeh, Ziarat, is ^he one dealt with in these notes. North-east of Fimzkuh, the road rises to a height of some 6,500 feet and passes over a series of plateaux to Khing, generally maintaining itself at the same mean elevation. A fair amount of grazing is found, and the Iliats make their summer quarters on these uplands. Little is procurable in the way of supplies, except such as may be found in the nomad camp. viz., sheep, goats, milk, and these only from March till November. Water is fairly plentiful. From Khing the road falls to 5,400 feet at Fulhad M ah alia, a village situate in a wide Basin, where water is of poor quality and very scarce (a mule track leads from here to panigban), thence to Chashma-i-Ali over a desert track where water is procurable at long intervals only, and very limited in quantity. At Chashma-i-Ali a good supply is again to be had ; here a.mule track leads to Damghan much used by caravans proceeding to Masbad- i-Sar by Chahardeh and Chaman-i-Sawar. Between Chashma-i-Ali and Ghahardeh water becomes more plentiful. Chahardeh itself consists of a fine cluster of villages which, however, have never entirely recovered the loss sustained during the great famine. Like Firuzkuh, Chahardeh is of importance as form ing an oasis in the surrounding wilderness and as lying on the caravan route from Dam ghan to Bandar-Gaz, which conveys nearly the whole of the cotton grown as far east as Sabzawar to Bandar-Gaz during the summer months. This road runs thus: Damghan, Chahardeh, Chaman-i-Sawar, Bandar-Gaz, The Shahrud Kuzluk Pass road to Astrabad is comparatively little used except in winter as an alternative route to the Chaman-Sawar when the latter may be closed for short periods by snow. Continuing from Chahardeh mountains covered with grass, juniper, etc., take the places- of the desolate hillsides hjtherto met with. Between the 11th and 16th mile the road passes- through a short mountain george, twenty or thirty yards broad only, with precipitous rocks on either side, and at the 19th mile a branch valley opens into the main route (Chaman-i-Sawar) which running north-east takes the higher ground to Ziarat. This north eastern valley is about half mile wide, enclosed by bold crags, and is ascended by a long narrow ridge to the plateau of Turk Maidan, another summer pasture of the Iliats. Six miles from Turk Maidan the edge of the plateau is reached and below lie stretched the plains of JVlazandaran and Astrabad. Ziarat lies in thick forest about half-way down the mountain side and is reached: by a circuitous course of five miles and a descent of some 3,740 feet, which, though very steep, is over good soil and easily traversable by mules in fine weather. In wet these might find difficulty owing to the clayey nature of the soil. From Ziarat to Astrabad the road offers some difficulty for 8 miles, passing as it does&gt; through forest, and generally in the rocky bed of a river; but afterwards for the last 4 miles- on a level and open country. It will be seen from the foregoing that the lateral road from Firuzknh to Astrabad is of importance in so far as it connects the two chief caravan routes, viz., the Tehran, Sultanabad, Firuz Kuh, Shirgeh, Mashad-i-Sar route with its two branches (Samnan, Do-ab, Mashad-i-Sar) Samnan, Firuz Kuh, Mashad-i-Sar and the Damghan, Chahardeh, Ghaman-i-Sawar, Bandai- Gaz route, which taps the country as fai east as Sabzawar. As regards its physical aspect, the track offers no difficulties to mules, except possibly in wet weather at the descent to Ziarat, and could be readily traversed by Infantry, Cavalry and; Mountain Guns. During years of ordinary rainfall water is sufficient with the exceptions noted. Fair grazing is available, and during the summer, standing crops could afford fodder for;- horses in case of necessity. From a military point of view the plateaux would be at the mercy of any troops having forced their way southwards as far as Chahardeh. To hold the plateaux, the Damghan, Bandar- Gaz road would have to be defended north-of Chahardeh, the defile 12-18 miles serving as a good position for such defence, or even others further north whence, I am told, the descent towards Bandar-Gaz is more abrupt than from the plateau of Turk Maidan to Ziarat. The road by Chaman-l-Sawar is described by Morier as the most difficult he ever traversed^ In some places deep in mud, in others over slippery rock, and that it is impossible to conceive a- country more easily defended against an invading enemy.500' No. 219, T ehran to A strabad, vid, Larfalley, ChasAma-i-Ati.

The descent on their eastern slope is steep- and only passable for mules, which take 30 minutes to accomplish it. At foot of descent is the Jajirud river, with a shooting box of the* Shah near its right bank. River is some 20 yards broad, and flows south-east to plain ot Veramin. It is spanned here by a stone bridge. Galandarek is situated at the foot of the spurs ot the Alburz range. Considerable cultivation and several small villages in its neighbourhood. Sup plies and water plentiful. From the Jajirud river to this village road is level and good and runs due- east. Galandarek has an elevation of (say) 5,8GCr ^hour's march. Just beyond Galandaiek a water course is crossed by a stone bridge. It comes from a mountain valley of the Alburz, where it has supplied water to a few villages, and it joins the Jajirud. Half a mile from Galandarek load, from an easterly direction, turns sharp north on entering a small village, and following right bank of a deep gorge for J of a mile ascends foot hills of the Alburz ; road in places overlooks a deep defile, and passing terraced fields and a few vil lages reaches Afchar, where supplies and water are plentiful. Afchar is (say) 6,500 feet above Galandarek. . i. n j ^ Leaving Afchar, course of a valley is followed, ana then a steep and stony ridge is ascended by a zig zag till a small plateau is reached with an altitude of (say) 7y300 feet. From this the ascent is exceedingly steep over a tolerably well construc ted mule road, till an altitude of (say) 9,000 feet is reached. Here watershed which divides the streams flowing into the Caspian from those now- ing south is crossed. # 11 t v ! Fifty minutes suffice for descent into the Lar val ley. At foot of pass mule road, which continues to the district of Mazandaran, and along whicn the supply of charcoal is brought for Tehran, must be quitted, and valley of the Lar, whic lies east and west, followed.

Lofty cone of Damavand domina tes the valley. Time, 4 hours. Road follows the Lar river through more or less grassy land for seven miles, crossing the river itself and a tributary of white sulphur ous water which joins it on left bank. This tributary rises at a remarkable sulphur spring known as Deev Assiah or ' Devil's well.' At seven miles from Yurt-i-Khanlar Khan the Lar Valley is contracted by the lava flow which, for merly issuing from Damavand and impinging on much contorted limestone rocks, dammed it up, forming a large lake. A stream, the Delichai, coming from the west slope of the extinct volcano, joins the main river at this point, viz., where it enters a deep gorge which it has cut through the igneous and limestone rocks. Road to Ask follows the river, but that for Damavand keeps to right from the confluence of the Ab-i-Safed, i.e., 1| miles from Yurt-i-Khanlar Khan, and passing through the mountains, after five miles the main road from Tehran to Mashad-i-Sar is reached; these five miles are rough from here. Turning south west it ascends for four miles up to Imamzada Kassim, whence it descends along the ridge of the mountains in a zigzag to Damavand in a south-easterl}' direction. Damavand is more of a town than a village, having a governor, and a population numbering from 6,000 to 8,000, and its neighbourhood is well cultivated. Cf. Route No. 229, stage 2. Six hours' march. Direction north-easterly. Road for the first three miles goes through cultivated ground and over a low hill to south-east, when it joins main road from Tehran to Firuzkuh, north-east by east. About three 'miles from road from this point to south-east, is a village called Ab Honck. Then road goes along foot of mountains on north ; those to south are about three miles distant. Sixteen miles from Dama vand, the village of Javun was passed ; popula tion 100, with a chaparkhanah. The river which passes this village goes to Varanck,502 No. 219— con Id.

The valley now being traversed is covered with cultivation which consists of corn and lucerne, also a few fruit gardens near the villages. Seven hours' march. Eoad goes for first five miles along foot of the mountains to the village of Saidabad, where there is a population of 30 families, when it winds into wild mountains of soft crumbling soil for eight miles, after which it descends to the river Delichai. This river comes from near the Damavand mountain and passes Hasanabad, and then it joins the Hable Rud which goes to Khar. From here the road winds deeper into the moun» tains, which are covered with pine-trees, for four miles, when the village Aminabad is reached. This village is on a slope on the mountains, and not so close to Firuzkuh as marked on St. John's map. Also village Arja- mand is not on the main road, but eight miles behind Aminabad to the north. Koad goes for another three miles up and down hills, when it comes to the river Nim Rud, which flows into the Hable Rud near Farahabad. About a mile from the road down the river there is a village called Haram Deh. Four miles further Lasun,- a village of ten families, was passed. People come here only in the summer for collecting the har vest and go in the winter to Firuzkuh. The country from here to Firuzkuh is more or less cultivated and covered with chamans (meadows). Firuzkuh is built at the foot of the mountains and is the residence of the deputy governor, who has jurisdiction over a large district. Ten hours' march. For first six miles road goes north-east along a rivulet coming from Gur Safed passing village of Komen; then it passes the Tang Sarenza. This valley is all covered with corn-fields. At the other end of the Tang there is an old fort in ruins situated on a hill. The- country now loses much of its rocky appearance, and it is broken into a variety of volcanic hills of various colours. The valley is called Gur- Safed, and it is 12 miles long. It is partially cultivated and inhabited by the Heftari tribe, who come here for the summer months to graze503 No. 219— contd.

Road goes for a mile from this valley between two low mountains, then it comes out into another village named Jash inhabited by the Sanghi Sari tribe, who go in the winter to their village Sanghi Sar, 12 miles north-east of Samnan. Eight miles further the valley of asaran was reached, which is well cul tivated. There is a caravansarai and a few huts. Three miles before reaching the caravansarai, road going from south to Mazandaran was reach ed. This road is much used for traffic in the winter between the latter place and Samnan. 8 v Fulhad Mahall^ 40 173 hours' march. Road first winds into the mountains, at the bottom of which are small patches of cultivation. It then ascends a steep mountain of a deep chalky soil to a pasturage, which having crossed, it enters on a very remark able tract of wild mountains. Leaving these heights one comes to a pine forest and then into the Rudbar valley with small patches of culti vation ; then it goes over some mountains and emerges into the Fulhad Mahalla plain, which is of large extent, but very little cultivated owing to the scarcity of water.

Road is at first good, but in the winter is said to be very muddy ; it follows a rivulet whicli turns off to north, eight miles from Fulhad Mahal- la. The river marked on St. John's map as going to Samnan is wrong; no such river was seen. Samnan is supplied with water from a river on the other side of these mountains, and from Sanghi Sar. Five miles from Fulhad Mahalla there is a ruined and uninhabited village called Nilu, near which some gypsies were encamped with some brood mares.

From here road is good and leading through hills, when it descends to Chashma-i-Ali Astenek, a village surrounded by gardens, near which the river passes. This river comes out from some low hills backed by mountains at Chashma-i-Ali Imamzada, which is two miles above the village, and goes to Damghan. It is full of fish. 61 hours. Direction north-north-east. A mile from the Imamzada one comes to a beautiful long valley all cultivated for seven miles. Four miles from Chashma-i-Ali, Relate, a village of 500 in habitants, is passed on left. Three miles further Chahardehis reached, which was composed of four villages (from which the name is derived), but only three villages exist now ; the fourth was ruined by an earthquake. Population 150. From here for four miles, road goes over a rocky mountain, whence it descends to the remarkable and diffi cult pass, Tang Shamshir Bur, which is a defile, 3 yards wide and 500 to 600 yards long ; rocks on each side are very high and perpendicular, insomuch that it would appear as if the hand of man had been employed in the formation of the pass. At its termination to north, the open ing is through a sort of natural gateway about four or five feet in width. When two caravans meet, one has to wait outside till the other A small stream flows through the pass, which makes the descent difficult for camels and other loaded animals. Even horsemen have to dis mount. The road from the gateway descends along the ridge of the mountains covered with pine trees. Two miles further there is another bad pass ; after that the road is good to Sawar. This place is used by the Government as a graz- ing-ground for artillery horses, it being a remark ably good place, All round Sawar the mountains are covered with pine trees. Nine hours' march. Direction north-east. Hav ing travelled about a mile a turn is made to right into another valley situated on main road from Shahrud to Mazandaran ; three miles fur ther a turn is made to left, and after two miles' march the ascent of the Jahan Numa is reached505 64 No. 219— conoid* T ehran to A strabad, vid Lar Valley^ Firuzhuh and Chashma-i-Ali* No. of stage.

Jahan Nuraa is a village of (say) 100 families, but owing to the thick mist that was hanging in the forest it was impossible to say. From here the descent, which is eight miles, is most difficult and most danger ous ; in some places the path is so narrow that a loaded beast can scarcely pass and in other places very slippery owing to the ground being always moist, besides there are many precipices. The kotals, south of Shiraz, are very good in comparison with this one. This pass is called the Sanduka. The road thence goes for 10 miles along a plain, the path being sometimes not more than 2 feet wide, through jungle, which continues unbroken to the walls of Astrabad. There is much danger of losing the way in this jungle, as the paths are numerous and cross each other. Cf. Route No. 68, stages 2 to 5. No. 220. T ehran to B ayazid, via Zindjan, Tabriz, Khoi.

The plain travelled over from Kasvin, now became hilly and broken j in some places the soil was soft, and the road swampy and muddy. All this part of the country is well watered by a variety of streams, but no large ones. For last three stages, cf. Route# No. 230, stages 11 to 13. General bearing of road north. On the left, in a valley, several villages ; the road all the way is full of ascents and descents. At 5 miles came to a valley with a stream and much cultivation, and, at an interval of 6 miles, a similar valley with a stream. About 4 miles from Armagana, came to a third stream. The whole distance from Zengan is intersected by valleys. There is a square fort in the town. General bearing north 15° west. Koad over a succession of hills, the valleys of which were mostly cultivated. At about J 2 miles, on the left hand side is the village of Dasht 13ukk. After this reach an eminence, from which an im mense range of snow-clad mountains was vis ible. Road much to the westward and over mountainone country. As 0 miles passed the village of Gul Tapa. At 15 miles came to the banks of the Kizil Uzan, which we crossed by an ancient bridge; the bed of the stream was about 200 yards in breadth, but was then in a great meas ure dry. Commenced the ascent of the Kafilan Kuh im mediately on quitting the river; this took just one hour, descent on opposite side half an hour. In descending saw another river called Rud Khona Mianeh ; it flows from west to east, and combined before being crossed with three other streams (the Karangu, the Sheher Cheyi, and the Aye Degemeish) about 3| miles to the eastward, carrying their united waters into the Kizil Uzan. Crossed the river by a bridge of 21 arches. Mianeh was formerly a large town, but is now a miserable village. For this and the next stage, cf.

Not a tree all over the country, but there is generally much cultivation. 17 Saidabad 25 321 Road good north 40° west. At 5 miles the village of Bini Kieu. At about the 20th mile entered a pass in the mountain, on the right of which was 1* a piece of water. After ascending and descending the pass, came to a caravansarai; it contains a square area of two hundred and sixty paces of solid construction. Turned off from the high road to the left, and at about 2^ miles from the caravansarai reached Saidabad. There is a great scarcity of wood over the whole country traversed. 18 Tabbiz ... 14 335 Bearing north 50° west. At 10 miles came to a stream running from south-west to north-east, and surrounded by more wood than latterly. The road across the plain is fine ; about 3 miles from Tabriz it is intersected by hills of a sandy and strong soil. 19 Ali Shah 24 359 Bearing of route, north 75° west. Difficulties along the road through the centre of the plain which was then (1st June) in many places flood ed. Near Tabriz, on the left, are some houses and gardens; then the village of Mayan. Having travelled 3 miles from Tabriz on a bearing nearly north, came to a bridge of nine large and three small arches, thrown over the river Agi, which flows from east to west, and falls into the Shadi (Urumia) lake. It rises near Ardabil, and is fordable by mules where we crossed it. About 4 miles from Tabriz passed the village of Alwar, and, 3 miles further on, another village of the same name, each surrounded with a609 No. 220—conid.

The greater part of the plain'is of a soil strongly impregnated with salt. About 4 miles from Ali Shah, we crossed a bridge of four arches. Luxuriant crops of barley and corn in the vicinity. The plain of Tabriz extends far to {he west and south. The lake of Urumia (Shadi) is about 7 farsahks (28 miles) from Ali Shah. 20 T asujf ... 33 391 After leaving Ali Shah, the road skirts Shebester, a large town surrounded by several villages, with luxuriant cultivation. Streams of water mean dered in every direction. Near Shebester passed the village of Mishola, and lower down in the plain those of Arsoleh and Hali, on the left of the road. Others are seen at every turn of the road, situated at small intervals on either side alternately. The road skirts the lake throughout its course; and about 5 miles from Tasuj is a village on the left called Kudhar Khona, where was a custom house. Tasuj has a number of old ruins about it, and must formerly have been a large place. 21 ♦ K hoi 36 421 Course for the first 10 miles, to the foot of the range which encloses the plain and lake, bore nearly west, when it suddenly turns to the north through mountains, and for 10 r : les more wound among them, through very narrow ^efiles, and by sharp ascents and descents, till we reached, on the far side, the plain of Khoi. Towards the lake the mountains are mostly of an argillaceous soil; but, towards Khoi, they are green to their sum- mits, and have valleys covered with fine pasture. At the distance of two farsakhs from Khoi (7 miles) passed on the right the village of Disa- jis, surrounded by fields of wheat and barley ; on the left of the plain are more villages. Passed a small range of hills, and came all at once on the plain of Khoi. Crossed the Otur by a seven- arched bridge ; the river flows from west to east, and falls into the Araxes, or Arras, about 12 far sakhs (42 miles) to the eastward. The plain of Khoi (in breadth from north to south, 5 miles, and in length 10 miles was covered with corn, broken only here and there by the foliagd of enclosed gardens.

The road over the plain was through rich country ; 2 miles from Khoi is a large col lection of houses and gardens. 23 Zauvia 24 451 Road on a bearing of north 50° west. From Pereh, we entered mountains of easy access, which, almost 10 miles before reaching Zauvia, opened into a plain, surrounded like a basin by mountains on all sides inclining to the centre. On entering the plain is the village of Selawan, high on the right, and, on the left, a small vil lage called Khore. The plain was cultivated in all parts. 24 Kara. Aina ... 18 469 Road on a bearing of north 20° west. Owing to rain the road was very muddy. From camp wo took a turn eastward to the village of Ikafti on the borders of a mountain torrent. Further on, for some miles, the road traverses a pass formed by the gradual meeting of the spurs of the moun tains ; it then entered an oval plain, extending for about 8 miles from north to south, and 3 in breadth. There are about 21 villages abtmt Kara Aina. Fifty miles south-west of Kara Aina is Van, from whence a road here joins in. The tract over which we passed, though generally of admirable soil, was for the greater part a waste. We saw, however, immense flocks grazing in the recesses of the mountains. 25 Aoajik 22 491 Bearing north 20° west. Road, on account of rain, very bad. A swamp at the extremity of plain. After passing the village of Ak-diza, the road leaves the plain, and winds through valleys formed by the western mountains. About 12 miles from Kara Aina are several hills.

In lieu of the old chaparkhanahs, substantial post- houses have been erected at a distance of about 16 miles apart. These post-houses are built of burnt brick, contain good rooms, partially fur nished, and have patches of garden in front of them. At Shahabad and Hazarek no provision;?, except tea, eggs and fowls are obtainable. About a farsakh from the former station the Karaj river is crossed by means of a substantial stone bridge, built, I believe, during the reign of Shah Abbas. At Yenghi Imam is a small village where mutton or lamb is sometimes procurable. Yenghi Imam possesses a mosque. Kishlak and Kavandeh are like Shahabad and Hazarek with regard to provisions. The plain between Tehran and Kasvin is plenti fully dotted with villages, orchards and vine yards, and large tracts of country are under barley and wheat cultivation. Cf. Eoute No. 220, stage 6.

These rooms are for the convenience of the owner of the village, who, however, rarely visits the place. Agha Baba is rich in flocks and herds. A carriage can be driven over the road from Kasvin to Agha Baba, which, however, for the first 5 miles, is heavy after rain. Shortly after leaving Agha Baba, the road enters the mountains (a spur of the Alburz range), is undulating and gradually ascending. Two far-» sakhs from Agha Baba, somewhat off the cara van road to the left is Mazeran*. a miserable and small village, where no supplies can be obtained, Midway between Agha Baba and Mazeran is a small stream, probably dry in summer, which is used for purposes of irrigation as frequent patches of corn on the hillside testify. With the ex ception of these patches there is scarcely any vegetation. From Mazeran the country becomes more moun tainous. The road is gravelly, and the ascent more marked. A stunted tree is occasionally seen in the valleys. At about 2 farsakhs from Mazeran the road becomes rocky in places and runs along the mountain side overlooking a ravine through which rushes a rapid stream fed by springs running down the face of the moun tains on either side. The water of these springs is flowing towards the Caspain, thus showing that the watershed or highest point of the moun tain has been passed. At 3 farsakhs from Mazeran, the fairly large village of Karza is ■ reached. Karza possesses a caravansarai fo^ the accommodation of animals, while good quar. ters for travellers are easily procured at the Kid- khuda's house. Supplies are obtainable here.f 8 P achinab 20 136 At Karza the road leaves the mountain torrent^ and the descent of the well known ^ Karza pass is shortly commenced. The road is tortuous, steep, and in places rocky, constantly descending for 2 farsakhs, when a broad and partially dry river-bed is reached, on the further side of which is PachinarJ.

From Pachinara road following: this stream is said to reach the upper plateau of Persia, i.e., the Kasvin plain, by a much easier gradient than that of the Karza, and if a railway was to be constructed from Rasht to Tehran, it would probably follow this route. The fact, however, of a narrow gorge having to be passed which becomes impracticable on the rising of the stream, renders the Karza pass preferable for traffic. At Pachinar there are a few houses in addition to the chaparkhanah and caravansarai, and some cultivation is seen along the bank of the river, which is a branch of the Safed Rud, the stream crossed by the road at Pachinar falling into it. Provisions scarce. During spring, however, lambs, sour milk, etc., can sometimes be purchased from the nomads who are fond of camping in this neighbourhood. The water here is rather liable to give dysentery. From Pachinar the road runs along the left bank of the river for a distance of one farsakh, when it is crossed by means of a stone bridge similar to that at Karij. For the next 2 far- sakhs the road follows the direction of the river, sometimes descending into the dry portions of its bed, and then ascending the mountain side for a few hundred feet. The road then leaves the course of the river and undulates through hillocks for one farsakh, when the large village or small town of Manzil is reached. The river is sometimes unfordable for ten days together. 9 M ANZZL 1G 152 Manzil from its position in the mountains is sub ject to high winds. It has a chaparkhanah, caravansarai, native telegraph office, several shops, and a goodly number of houses. Olive trees flourish, and there is a good deal of cultivar tion. Provisions are plentiful. Half a farsakh from Manzil the Safed Rud is peached. Two or three years ago two arches of the brick bridge, which here crosses the river, were washed away, and the Persians seem unable to effectually repair the damage; several attempts have been made and efforts are still being made to substantially rebuild the broken arches, but unfortunately the work of the modern Persian has heretofore proved insufficiently strong to withstand the force of the river when in flood.

Passing the village of Duzarkash, Hisamabad, and others the road, after another 6 miles, reaches the line large village of Bikandi, situated on a stream flowing into the Mullah AH valley, and past Pachinar. The telegraph poles now cross the Burandasht range, whilst the projected hue of railway will folloW the Bikandi valley. From the little spring, called Asalek, there is a steep ascent. The road then enters into the Aspabin valley, over-towered on the right by the rugged Piruz range. This valley passes at Beg Baghi into that of the Yuzbashi stream, which is rather wider. Here figs and oleanders already attest a warmer climate. After winding for a while_ through this valley, past winter camps_ of Ghaiasvand nomads, the road enters the main valley of Mullah Ali (called also i u S a r . j n )* The picturesque village of Mul lah Ah is deserted in summer, only a few men remaining to guard the rice-fields. The stream at this plape is not passable in spring, except by the bridge. Passing the village of Kogir, the road reaches a few miles farther the post-house of Pachinar.

The road then bends to the left, and about 3 miles from Pai-K Chinar, crosses the bridge of Loshan, beyond which the district of Jamalabad commences^ The heat here is intolerable. The Shahrud here- flows through a broad sandy valley, bounded on either side by dry barren hills. The villages are only inhabited in winter. The cane-brakes on the banks, and the dry plains beyond, swarm with bugs. To the right are mountains of some height with a few trees and villages, of which Biwarzan is the most important. On the left the hills are lower; in a valley on this side are the villages Ulkand and Ulshan. Near the northern end of the valley, lies the village of Siyapush, with large olive groves. Twelve miles from the' Loshan bridge is the village of Manjil, with a post-house and telegraph office. Above it, at the- edge of the forest, the little village of Har-zeblL Rustamabad proper is a large village in the moun tains some distance (perhaps 3 miles) off the road to the left. The chaparkhanah stands alone near the roadside ; provisions scarce. The cara- m vansarai is a quarter of a mile beyond the chapaxv khanah, where there is also a very small village. Leaving Rustamabad the road is somewhat hilly for the first farsakh, when a toll-gate is passed, whence there is a made road the whole way \o Rasht. This road, however, as far as Kudum is. for the most part in a shocking state of repair^ and after wet weather is a veritable quagmire. When the river is not full its bed forms the best track in many places. Near the toll-gate, fertile country is entered, and at 4 farsakhs distant, over an undulating rough road through beautiful forest scenery, the cbaparkhanah of Kudum is; reached. Kudum consists of a chaparkhanah and caravan-- sarai. Supplies are very scarce. Owing to the humidity of the climate the floors of the buildings are boarded, the roofs sloping and red-tiled, a&amp; indeed are all the buildings throughout the pro vince of Ghilan. From Kudum to Rasht the distance is not more than 16 miles, notwithstanding the postal autho rities pay for 6 farsakhs, and the chaparkhanah- people charge for 7 and sometimes 8 faiy619 No. 222— contd.

The road is level and good with a ditch and hedgerow on each side. Two farsakbs from Kudum is a small maidan surrounded by shops. Here a bazaar is held every Wednesday, from which fact the place is called Chehar Shamba^ Shelter sheds and cottages are passed on this road. Beans, rice and mulberry trees are exten sively cultivated. Le Mesurier (1888) described this part of the road as fairly good, cobbled in some places and staked and bound at the sides. Rasht is a moderately-sized town with a large amount of bazaar in proportion to its size. The principal products are rice, tobacco, silk and embroideries. There are two consulates (Russian and English), several good caravansamis, a custom house, post-house, telegraph office, chaparkhanah etc. Rasht has a mixed population, Turkish, Persian, Armenian, Russian and Hebrew being the languages most used in the bazaars. * * * 9 » Another authority gives the following account of the road between Kustamab'ad and Kasht 11 A nzali 15 The road is a stony series of ascents and descents^ varied occasionally by a slough honeycombed by the feet of passing animals. On one side is a pre cipice, towards which the path shelves in a sinister fashion. At 6 miles pass a bridge over a tributary of Safed Rud. 12 R asht 12 ••t The road goes through swamp and jungle for } mile, and then gets on the main Rasht road, which is excellent at first, with ditches on each side and a wall fence a foot high; but the good part comes only in patches, while between are veritable sloughs of despond, which look as if made to break the legs of animals. At 6 miles reach a sarai, when the road improves. **9*9 13 P ie B azxb 8 216 From Rasht to Pir Bazar is 2 farsakhs of flat road generally in a frightful state of disrepair.

After which, road varying in direc tion from west to west-south-west^ arrives at 4th mile at village of Salian. Close beyond Salian come to deep bed of the Karij, in which at this season there is little water, but during the floods this is a dangerous and difficult ford, and accidents frequently occur. Thence proceed north by west passing presently a weather-worn artificial mound and village Kulma, situated at 5th mile. Then south-west by west to that of Sultanabad at the 6th mile, and south-west by south and south-west to that of Nasrabad, at 8-| miles the villages on the plain around becoming less frequent.

Being on the high road to Ramadan, it is a station for caravans, for the use of which there is good accommodation. Prom this to Paizabad is 7 farsakhs, or 28 miles, generally over a parched and desert tract, which it is better to traverse during the night, in order to avoid exposure to the great heat in a part where water, if procurable at all, is salt or brackish.

Here also the water is brackish, but this is not the case throughout the district. The houses are generally domed, wood for rafters being scarce. The produce of the fields appears to be confined to barley, wheat, melons and cotton. Proceed southward for miles, past village Shalgan, and then from south-south-west to south-west by west by a good road and gentle ascent over a country frequently intersected by hills. Path afterwards became stony, and at about 10th mile a long descent commenced through a hilly country towards the plain of Saveh, which is traversed in direction south-west. Reach this small and ruinous town, after a ride of nearly seven hours, or about 21 miles. Some supplies and brackish water procurable. Way led to village Bagh-i-Shekh, situated 5 miles east-south-east of Saveh. Thence travel to vil lage Tehris Nahid, east-south-east, a distance of 4 miles, beyond which plain presents large patches of Kavir, consisting of a light and highly saline soil, almost destitute of vegetation, which on the fall of rain becomes a bog or marsh. On drying it cracks all over and breaks up, as though from the action of the plough, and in this state a horse will generally sink to its fetlocks in it. Prom Tehris Nahid the bearings were south 2o| 0 east for a short space, then south-east and east-south east to village and caravansarai of Mujidabad, situated at 17 miles from Saveh.

The road from the last camp passes along the base of the hills, and crosses a small stream of running water at 3 miles after which it traverses a level stony plain to H^mdes, where it crosses a river-bed with a little running water brackish, but drunk bv cattle, to a dilapidated caravansarai, called Sho rab after the stream. The latter runs through a rather deep bed, with steep sides, but the cross- ing on the road is an easy one. Good water almost sweet, is to begot from a small sprW running towards the caravansarai from the south and irngating a few fields.

Thence a barren stony- plain to camp. The last mentioned Jcdnat is taken along parallel to the road for 3 miles, then fills a tank and turns off to the left through an avenue of young trees to villages, If miles off the road. The whole of the above march is heavy with dust and atones, but fit for wheels. At Sin- sin there are two caravansarais. The hills are at 2J miles south of the caravansarai, and several streams are brought thence in kanats, one of which supplies excellent water to a vaulted cis tern at the caravansairai. Watercourse crosses road between post-house and village. There are five or six small villages dotted about the plain at no great distance, but little cultivation. Water good during latter part of March. Encamp on banks of stream or near caravansarai. Supplies must be got from Kashan. This stage may be divided into two, by halting^ at Shorab, 12 miles from Pasangan, where there is a caravansarai in good repair (Markham), but no supplies ; water and firewood only procurable. General direction south-south-east. 'Road level and good until near Kashan, where it becomes diffi cult from the light sandy soil. The plain is generally barren, but there are villages and cultivation along the bottom of the hills to the right. At 7 miles pass water and cultivation at the small caravansarai and village of Kasim- abad. At 11 miles it reaches the small town of Nasarabad in cultivated country to the left. The town is said to have a small bazaar, its houses being of mud, many of them double-storied, wilh rounded roofs. There is a masonry caravansarai on the road with halakhanas outside the town, and two masonry-covered tanks which, however, rarely contain good water. A better supply can be got from a spring said to exist outside the town on the north-east side. All the country up to the hills, at 3 miles south-west, is irrigated, and there are several small villages in sight.^ The road thence passes over a partially cultivated plain with many villages in sight, and at 13§ miles reaches two contiguous villages, Bahlun and Aliabad, the latter a large village, in the centre of which is a small fort with high walls and towers at the four corners. At 16f miles there is a village called Nushabad on the left, with a conspicuous blue domed itnamzada, and a good deal of cultivation and trees.

A few miles farther on two roads lead to camp at Kashan. Kashan is a large irregularly built town with high walls of mud, which are flanked by but- tresses, generally in ruins. On the south side these walls sire surrounded by a ditch, and the whole is falling to pieces/ The trade and manufactures are considerable, consisting of carpets, copper uten sils and silks, and the water-supply is good, being drawn from a few wells, and from three Jcanats, one coming from Fin, a well-known garden and palace of Shah Abbas, distant 4 miles, one from Nasarabad, and the third from the hills. Ka shan contains a telegraph office, a large building in a walled garden outside the Darwaza-i-Daolat, and several caravansarais. Two roads lead to the town from the direction of Sinsin ; the first fol lows the telegraph post to the telegraph office; and the second, a hollow road, turns off to the right, and passing through various gardens enters one of the western gates and goes through a line of fine bazaars to the Darwaza-i-Daolat at the east end. Supplies abundant of every kind. Encaraping- ground, 1 mile south of city, near watercouive flowing through plantations. Curzon thus describ es Kashan : ' one of the most dilapidated cities in Persia. A more funereal place, I have not yet seen.' , General direction south by east to entrance of Dara-i-Duzdan pass, thence south by west. Eoad undulating. Easy ascent over stony ground for first 5 miles, thence rugged the whole way to stage. Leaving Kashan telegraph office, the road runs along a narrow causewayed road be tween the city and the Birun-i-Shahr, a large suburb, and then passing several water-mills, crosses a stony plain to a ruined village at 4 miles, where there is a good stream of water. Thence it goes over the same plain, gradually ascending towards the hills on the right, and at 13 miles enters the Dara-i-Duzdan pass, with a small forti fied village at its entrance, and ascends gradually to Gabarabad, a small caravansarai at 15 miles. Ihe road is in places rocky, and runs along the left bank of a deep ravine to a small plateau commanding the pass, on which the caravansarai is built.

The road then enters and follows the bed of this nullah ; high mountains on the left; and a less elevated flat-topped ridge along which infan try might march* To the right, at 22 miles, the river is closed by a dam, forming a fine sheet of water in the spring. If this bank were to hurst, Kashan and surrounding country would be inun dated. Road passes along right margin of the lake, which is 7,000' above the sea, and such water as may remain in it or the stream is liable to be frozen. The ascent here is steep and roughly paved, but guns could be -dragged over it. At 25 miles the valley opens out, forming a fine open plateau, surrounded by hills. _ The road follows a valley to the right, down which flows the stream from Koh-rud to Gabarabad, and shortly after enters the fine terraced gardens and cultivation of the latter. The water in the brook here and at Koh-rud is free from the white precipitate observed farther down. Koh-rud is a large rich village, built on the side of the steep bare hills to the right of the road, in the arc of a circle, the chord of which is occupied by a small caravansarai and post-house, and an old fort on an eminence. The valley below the village is about half a mile wide, and is filled with chinars, poplars and fruit trees ; above the village the valley opens to a mile wide, and is carefully cultivated in terraces irrigated by the stream running towards Gabarabad, which will be noticed below. There are large herds of goats and sheep at the village. Encamping-ground for small force off road on slopes of hills. General direction south-west. Road good ; steep near top of pass. From Koh-rud the road follows the valley of the Gabarabad stream, which disap pears at 3 miles. The ascent is gentle at first, but becomes rather steep near the top of the pass at 5 miles (8,750'From this point the road des- cends slowly through high valleys surround ed by gently sloping hills, and communicating with each other by gorges with precipitous hills on each side. There is a little good water in a marshy spring at 7 miles, and a good stream at 9 miles, which is a favourite hal^g- place for mules. The road thence runs through a narrow valley shut in by barren hills.

Soh consists of two considerable walled villages, built on slight eminences and a large brick cara- vansarai in rear of the space between them, on the rough rising ground towards the hills about a quarter of a mile off. The village walls are flanked by towers, and the houses are loopholed for musketry. These villages are built in an irrigated valley running north, 20° east and south, 20° west, and bounded to the west by a high and bold range of hills running off into a more rounded and lower range towards the south end of the valley. The latter is divided diagonal ly by a nullah, 20' or 30' wide and difficult to cross, which irrigates the fields, and supplies the villages with water. There is a telegraph station. One farsakh further on are the village and post- house of Bideshk. (Curzon.) General direction south-east. Eoad level and good across a wide barren plain. Leaving Soh the road crosses the nullah at the lower village by a high causeway with a small waterway, both banks high and abrupt. At 5i miles the road passes the vil lage of Deh-Lur, on the left bank of the nullah, and leaving the latter on the right, passes over a wide barren plain, on which at 16 miles is an ahambar, which generally contains good rain water. From this point Morchikan is distant 7 miles across the same plain. Morchikan is a large fortified village, walls about 500 to 700 yards long and flanked by round tower*. There is an other large village, about 1,000 yards off, and several extensive walled gardens near the post- house and caravansarai. The water-supply is from a canal which is passed just before reaching the caravansarai. It is said to be brackish, but is hardly appreciably so. The village is situated on a wide plain 1| miles south-east of some small hills. Supplies scarce. Encamp in plain near caravansarai or beyond village. According to Markham this stage is 28 miles, while Curzon calls it 24. Water is plentifal and flows m streams from the Jcanats. (Markham.) 259 General direction south-east by east.

On the south of it, near the Armenian burial-ground, is a fine open space for an army to encamp. Sup plies of every kind plentiful. There is a British Consul here. Population from 70,000 to 80,000. (Curzon), The Zaindarud is crossed by five bridges, as it passes through Isfahan, which are described as follows by Curzon. Commencing from the west or up stream :— 1. Pul-i-Mainur, of brick, with arches of varying size and shape, resting on roughly hewn stone piers. 2. Pul-i-Chahar Bagh, or Julfa, ' the stateliest bridge in the world approached by a paved ramp or causeway, the bridge is entered at the west end by a gateway. Its entire length is 388 yards, the breadth of the paved roadway is 30'.' On either side is a covered narrow path way, 2^' wide, opening by frequent arches, both on to the road inwards and outwards to the river, and surmounted by an open footpath. In addition to these roadways, there is a vault ed passage below the roadway, to which access536 No. 226— contd. T ehran to I spahan, via Post Road, D istances I If miles. No. of Names of stages.

The bridge is of 33 arches of 20' span and 15' high, the piers being 11' thick. 3. Pul-i-Jhubi, 300 yards further east, down stream. Plain brick bridge of 14 arches. 4. Pul-i-Khaju, 300 yards further, 24 arches, span ning 154 yards. Built on top of a dam or band of solid stone with sluice-gates at intervals. The bridge is of brick and has a second roadway similar to that described in No. 2, passing aIon&lt;* the top of the causeway. The main roadway is 24' broad, and is also flanked by covered gal leries. 5. Pul-i-Sharistan, of brick, on stone foundations and piers. South of the river lies the suburb of Julfa.

The gradients throughout are easy and suitable for transport work, although at times along some of the slopes the collar work is severe. The hills which the road traverses are of a clayey formation, often covered with a loose sandy rubble, which has been utilized as material for metalling. This rubble binds readily with the clay, and forms a good solid bed for traffic; fortunately the greater part of the road runs over clayey soil, so all that is required to keep the surface in order, is that sufficient gravel should be scraped off the hill-sides, or brought up from the rivers and strewn over it. The sandy stretches of the road are less easy to deal with and require more attention, as owing to the non-binding property of the sand, a greater thickness of rubble is necessary.

Route N o. 21«i stage 4, The road passes through several well-supplied villages. From Sarbandan to Firuzkuh. no supplies are to be had, except in small quantities, at the wretched huts which are called tlie caravan- sarais of Aru, Delichai and Aminabad. At Aru the road gradually inclines towards the range of hills to the south. The Delichai river is a rapid mountain stream flowing from the north west in a deep ravine, through a mountainous broken country. To the east of the ford is a steep and rocky ascent over hills sprinkled with juniper. From Aminabad to Cihazan-chai the load is good, except at the descent to the river, which is abrupt and rocky. The Ghazan-chai flows from the north. It is a considerable stream, but fordable at all seasons. The road from Firuzkuh into Mazandaran leads over a pass, about 10 miles to the north-east ^ of that place. Near the summit of the pass is a large and well-built, though now ruined, caravan- sarai. On the 9th April the snow was deep on tl.e summit of the ridge for about half a mile, and the road had only recently been opened. Immediately below the snow on the northern side is a forest of stunted oak, and the path runs in the bed of a small stream, the source of the Talar river. This bed descending becomes a narrow ravine, and in the course of a few miles the oak gives place to the juniper, elm, chesnut, beech, box and rhododendron, springing from every crevice of the rocks. At 32 miles below the remains of a hill fortress, called by the people of the country the Castle of the Dev-i-Sused, the ravine contracts to a narrow gorge, which was formerly defended b^ a stone wall, the remains of which and of a gateway are still visible. In the vicinity of this place are a few patches of barley. One mile beyond burkhrobat rice is cultivated. The road here runs through a dense thicket, and before we reached the PuU-Sufed, which is a well-built stone bridge over the Talar. we came upon the commencement of this branch., or bhaa Abbas's causeway. At Pul-i-Sufed the road turns north-north-west and continues along the eastern bank of the river, and as far as^ Shirgah it is execrable. The causeway of ShaK Abbas has a magnificent work, formed by a trench, 20 feet deep and 14 wide, cut in the side of the mountain,572 No. c Z%9—~co7i{d.

In consequence of the incessant vains which fall in this part of the country, and of the want of all repair this c-auseway has heen nearly destroyed. In inwiv parts the stones have been washed away, and their place having been supplied by Wg and branches of trees, it is difficult even for mules to pass. Sabi '• ' Fo y r mil es beyond Shirgah the road leaves the hills and enters upon a fine level tract of countrv covered with cultivation, pasturage, and wood The road here diverges to the north-north-east from the Talar river. Between Aliabad and Sari, 15 miles m a not th»east direction, the causeway for a mile or two is in good repair, and leads through a natural avenue of ma^nnificent trees. All traces of it are then lost until within 3 miles of Sa i Travellers are obliged to pick out a pathway for themselves through swamps, brushwood, and nce-nekls, at some distance from the original line of road. 0 Ouselcy's acconnt eomrnpnees from a point (name unknown) 19 miles on the lehran side of Kauun :— 1 K ailun 19 Dblichai Fibuzkuh 24 21 43 64 The road crosses a deep river-bed near the town, and at 1 mile ascends a high hill winding by a narrow and dangerous path; it then des cends and crosses the river. The next 4 miles lie over hills and through chasms between moun tains; and at 8 miles again crosses the river; then for 2 miles it goes along the river, which it exosses by a ford at 12 miles. At 16 miles reach fcarun, a beautiful village ; then in 3 miles reach Kailun, crossing and recrossing the river twenty times. ^ The road goes back on the last stage 1 mile; then goes nearly east along a valley between two ranges of hills.

It then descends for ^ mile, and forests appear, the road narrowing and becoming very difficult, when it goes over steep mountains, or in the bed of the river covered with boulders, the hills on both sides being covered with jungle. At 18 miles reach some huge rocks, called Khana-i-Dev-i-Sufed: neai this is the dilapidated sarai of Surkhrobat. Beyond, at 4 miles come to Doab f at the junction of two streams; and 4 miles farther to Talar Rudbar. 5 zlrab 16 108 The l*oad goes along the river Talar for 6 miles, and is in many places execrable j then crosses it by the Ful-i-Sufed a bridge of two arches. Thence it is very difficult indeed over a rugged path, up and down steep hills through chasms between rocks, crossing the Talar at least twenty times, and frequently passing morasses where horses sink to the saddle girth. 6 Shirgah • 1 18 126 The road still continues by the Talar river, fre quently crossing it for the first 9 miles along Shah Abbas's causeway, completely broken up, and is very difficult indeed. At 7 miles arrive at the S'ar-i-Kala, a frightfully difficult ascent, up which animals cannot go without being reg ularly dragged up. Thence the road continues equally bad by Mian-i-Kala, through magnificent forest to Shirgah. The road is execrable, some times on a, level with the stream, sometimes as cending 500 to 600 feet above. Several torrents are crossed by good bridges. At 22 miles the road becomes more level and the hills recede. 7 Aliabad 10 136 The road commences very bad, going through a most beautiful country on the right bank of the Talar for 8 miles, when this river is crossed. At 7 miles ascend a well-wooded hill; thence road to Barfarush. 8 Sari 16 152 The road is much better, but at 3 miles the cause way disappears, and travellers have to go as best they can through the fields.

N. 40° W. At 5 miles a villnge. At about the liOth mile, we entered a pass in the mountain, on the right of which was a piece of water.

Beyond this the road goes at considerable height, and then up and down past gardens and fields through dry watercourses to little mountain village Aghal- dar, whence it ascends more steeply into Bagiran mountains, crossing which it descends, crossing deep valley and falling and rising repeatedly, till it begins to follow the windings of a steeply ascending stony valley. Then a little pass is crossed to a side valle}^ from which the road again at once ascends among high and steep rocks to the highest point of the road, from whence on either side rise abrupt rocky crests. Thence the road descends for 2farsakhs along a valley, at first stony and pretty steep, through a saline watercourse overgrown with tamarisk ; then the slope becomes less, and the valley is contracted farther down by-high rocky walls into a deep ravine. Beyond this it widens again and crosses to fields of Kalat-Kuli-Sin, whence it follows the deeply-worn bed of stream coming down from the mountains to a steeply sloping plain, and from which the road descends along a karez.

Naiband at 31 miles is a fair-sized village of some 100 houses; it was planted as an outpost against the Baluchis. The inhabitants make their living by importing corn, etc., and reselling it to travel lers, as they only grow enough corn for their own consumption, although they have generally a large surplus of dates. At 26 miles the camel route takes a course about a mile longer over perfectly level ground and joins the Birjand road about a mile from the outskirts of the village. The whole country is suffering from drought as may be seen from the fact that most of the haozes are dry : also nearly all their sheep have died, only the goats surviving. No camels at Nai band, only a few very fine donkeys. From Tun to Naiband the only part offering the slightest difficulty for wheels is the belt of hills, 6 miles from Naiband. The late governor of Karman is said to have sent three carriages the whole dis» tance from Karman to Ma shad and evidently by going a mile or two more to east, a perfectly- flat plain would be found. Naiband is very important as being the meeting point of the Mashad, Herat, Birjand, Sistan, Karman and Yazd roads. Its water-supply is ample and very good, but once outside the village there is only the very scantiest grazing, whence no camels. No. 234. Tun to Nishabur, via Bardashand. Authority —MacGregor.

At 16 miles Tun, a walled town perhaps IJ miles across, mostly filled with cultivation and ruins, but a size larger than Jumain. The town is governed by Mirza Ghulam Khan, aged 25, son of the governor of Tabas. The bazaar is very poor, not even producins: potatoes or onions. Population from 4,000 to 5,000. Although this route is apparently not used for through traffic, from a military point of view, it offers a very good alternative route to that Bajistan. With the exception of the Kotal-i- Kalat, which is even now passable for artillery, the road is remarkably good for all arms, being, as a rule, very hard. As regards water, the only stretch without an abundant supply is from Jangalto Bimurgh, some 24 miles. Elsewhere there is a practically unlimited supply. Firewood and forage are also abundant as also all supplies, as both Tun, Jumain and Turbat are situated ia very fertile districts.608 No. 239— contd. Y azd to K asiian, vid AJcda, Nain and Ardidan.

About 4 miles road crosses a ridge of hard sand] and thence to Haoz-i-Jafar, 10 miles from Yazd', is a succession of hard sand and gravel ridges' and heavy soft sand hollows. Water is good (from two ahamhars) at Haoz-i-Jafar. Eoadthen enters the hills seen north of Yazd, and ascends very gradually over stones and gravel up a valley enclosed by steep, rugged and bare hills on either side. At 6 miles (from Haoz-i-Jafar) a river-bed is crossed, and then there is an almost imper ceptible rise to the watershed between this valley and the next. The road then descends very easily to^ Anjirak, the general direction of the march being north-north-east and north-east, and the distance not far short of 22 miles. 2 K haeanak 23 45 Road leaves Anjirak in a direction of 25°, and at 1 mile passes the old sarai and an ahamhar. It then ascends easily over the neck of a hill for 1| miles, and descends very easily over gravel for 1 mile, when it follows an open valley running east and west. At miles it passes the Haoz- i-Sufed, which is in ruins, and has no water. 4J miles onward it goes through a low gravel ridge, and shortly after passes another old haoz with no water. At 13J miles it enters another low gravel ridge, and, passing on the left the road to the well of Chah-i-Nao (2 miles off, with water), it ascends by an easy gradient to the top of a ridge in 2J miles. Next it descends very gradual ly over gravel, through a sort of plateau, and arrives after 7 more miles at Kharanak. The water-supply here is good, and there is an excel lent sarai; but supplies are scarce. There is no village nearer to Kharanak than Saugand on the north or Ardakan about 45 miles to the west on a bearing of 255°. The road from Kharanak descends at once into the ^ a ^ ne the same name, and goes through a ( ~®™ low hills on either side for 8 miles. At the 4th mile there is some water.

Road now gets somewhat more stony, but is good going. At 12|- miles road fairiy enters the mountains, and ascends very gently and easily in a narrow .valley, with high, steep, rugged and bare mountains close on each hand. Road still good, and here valley is covered with tufts of camel- thorn. At 14 miles ascent continues to this point (852' above Yazd and 4,630' above the sea). From here road gently descends over the same nature of ground, closely shut in by mountains as before. Road continues to descend till 15f miles (4,430' above the sea). From here a valley that expands to the dimensions of a plain falls by an easy descent to the west, and opens out the great plain of Yazd. At 16 J miles arrive at good cara van sarai of Anjirak. Here there are latrines outside the caravansarai, a thing very rarely to be seen. There is a tank where the water is excellent, and a fort. Grass is the thing only to be bought here. Anjirak is nearly enclosed by high, bare moun tains ; there are stones everywhere, and a few tufts grow about the place (altitude 4,690'). Anjirak is usually the first stage out of Yazd. The route from Anjivak is over a stony road, level. About | a mile from the caravansarai there is an old and ruined fort. Road still ascends very gently, and again descends by a very easy gradient.

Eoad is now in a plain or plateau with tufts, about 2 miles wide, sloping down from here very gently. Beyond this some old kanat wells are seen, and at 34J miles the village and fort of Kharanak is gained. In this village there are 100 houses and a good new caravansarai. There is also a fort. Wheat, barley, turnips, and carrots are grown; no potatoes. Milk, eggs, fowls, grain, and straw can be bought. This plain is 5,450' above the sea. Water good. See Index. Down narrow gully between black, slaty rocks. Road steep in parts, but not bad, and wheeled artillery might go over the whole. There is an immense amount of salt efflorescence, and at a distance of about | a mile from Kharuna the stream is salt, and disappears soon afterwards. There is a little scrubby tamarisk in the valley. At 3 miles, pillar b^ the side of track marks the road to Ardakan. About a mile beyond this there is said to be a spring of fresh water. At 4| miles the gully opens somewhat; road is down the dry bed of a torrent enclosed on both sides by hills; it is still very good. At 7i miles the bed of the watercourse is lost in a vast and open plain, sparsely sprinkled with tufts, Koad still descends easily and gently ; it is hard and good, though here and there stony ; it is now on the glacis-like slope that comes from a low range of hills on the left. This slope is continued beyond the road to the right and to the front. At 10 miles, road begins to turn gradually round to the north thus turning the end of a spur on the left. At 13i miles is a dry tank. Colonel MacGregor's estimate of the distance is 16 miles or nearly \ longer than the above estimate.

There are, however in places a good manj stones. The road now gradually enters the hills, and at 21 miles has low hills on both sides. At a mile or 2 distant these gradually close in on the road, which still ascends easily. At 21| miles is a well, where there is a small amount of water, but not sufficient for travellers' horses. At 23 miles there is another dry well. At 23| miles the road to Rizab turns off to the left, for Rizab is not the direct road from Khanma to Sukand. At 24^ miles arrive at Eizab (29 miles, MacGregor). No village or cultivation ; a mined tower, and a half-ruined caravansarai. No supplies of any kind. The water is sufficient, but rather salt. Rizab lies close under some hills on the north, those on the south being some 6 or 7 miles dis tant, at an elevation of 3,750' above the sea. Route from liizab is over a good and hard road steadily, but easily, ascending over the plain, which is enclosed by low black hills on both sides. At 291 miles the summit of the watershed, which connects the hills on the north and south, is gained. Then comes a mile or 2 of perfectly level ground before the descent is commenced. Altitude of this watershed or neck is 4,420' above the sea. At 30f miles, road is in a plain, sloping like a glacis downwards to the right for about half a mile, where it is bounded b} 7- a very low ridge, beyond which is another plain.

From here there are two roads to Robat-i-Khan ; southern or right hand road being 2 farsakhs (6 to 8 miles) longer than the nortltern, and more subject to raids of Baluch robbers. Both roads pass over about the same distance of heavy sand, but northern road is the worse of the two after rain, and is difficult to trace. The northern or shorter road is the one now described. There are no dwellings of any kind on this road, but on the southern there is a caravansarai with sweet water at Shutaran,* 3 farsakhs from Robat-i-Khan, where is also a fort, but no residents aud no cultivation. At 12 miles the mountain on the right ends, aud the plain stretches many miles to the E. On left is the sanie apparently limitless plain. The road up to this is hard and good. In front to the N.

A ruined fort lies a J mile to the N.W, An isolated pjiamidal peak lies also to N. W,, rising alone amongst the low hills inthat direction. To W, the country is broken and hilly for some miles, but there are no high mountains. To E. there is a distant range of hills. Plain is much cut up and broken. There are low hills in every direction. Altitude of this point 4,850', The road proceeds in a N. N. W. direction among low hills. It continues thus as far as Kala-i- Maidan, At 24 miles there are three villages ; they are poor places, containing some 30 houses each, all enclosed in forts, which are square. With towers at the corners. The plain here appears to be surrounded on all sides by hills at a distance of 6 or 7 miles. There are no high mountains very near. The plain itself is cut up, broken, and hilly. There is a considerable amount of cultivation, but where not cultivated the plain is stony and covered with tufts. T he road from the Gudar to this point is good. At the Kala-i-Maidan the water is sweet from hctnats, and supplies are procurable. Tho principal of the three villages is on right of road. At 25 miles road strikes the bed of a watercourse, diy, but on the side of which is an irrigation channel. Road follows down this watercourse fof some distance, keeping on its left bank. Here towers may be seen all over the fields. At 27J miles the large, wide bed of a watercourse comes from left. There is in winter a small stream of salt water in it. Road now follows down the winding river, keeping entirely to its bed ; the amount of water increases, and the banks, which at first were only 6' or 7' high, get higher and higher, until the river is running through a gorge between steep hills of clay and sandstone 200' to 300' high, which slope sharply down to the bed, leaving but little flat ground for bed of rivef. Road is good enough in dry weather, but impassable when river is swollen, and then there is no alternative route, except for people on foot. Bed of river is covered with fine black sand, but going very good. The water is crossed times innumerable. Road con tinues thus without variation until 34 miles from Sir. At 34 miles river bursts from its prison, and gains a vast, bare and stony plain. Road is at once directed on the snowy Nishabur range, one low632 No. 243— co at (I, Yazd to Mashad, via Khar an ah^ Pusht-i-Badam, 8fc. Biage. Names of stages. \ D istances in miles, Interme diate.

Crossing the valley ascend the watershed Kopet Dagh : ascent very difficult for bagg age animals and rocky for 2 miles. The des cent from the watershed is mostly over soft ground, the first two-thirds of a mile in a North-East direction and the last three miles in a South-East direction by the valley wind ing to the source of the Ab-i-Garm. The valley of the Ab-i-Garm through which the road now runs, is narrow and uncultivated. There are a number of spiings in the valley which overflow and make difficult going. Amirabad is inhabited by 10 Kurdish families, who have 140 cattle and 1200 sheep and goats. Annual supply of 320 cwts of wheat and 190 cwts of barley. 4 ■ Karatigan 23l N 68| For 3 miles follows right bank of the Chacha : valley uncultivated, 200 to 300 yards broad, and bounded by low hills. At 3 miles road cros ses to the left bank by a good ford and enters into a transverse valley, running North-West. At 2 miles from the ford a stiff ascent and descent practicable for baggage animals. The next 4^ miles a slight descent to the bottom of the defile, after which road leaves the defile and runs north along a spur for one mile and then descends to a spring at Sangu- nek. From here to Karatigan the road runs along a valley, at first with a slight as cent and then descent: this portion of the road is practicable for wheeled traffic. Kara tigan is populated by 50 families, who have 450 cattle. Annual supply of 5800 cwts of wheat and 3220 cwts of barley. No fuel or grazing en-route. 5 Dushak 33l 102 As far as Hodji-Bulan (Hoja-Botan) road runs along the valley. The gorge at Hodji-Bulan is very narrow, bounded by rocky but low hills : the path passing through it is verv narrow and would require to be widened for a distance of 300 yards. For the next 5 miles road runs along the foot of the hills and then through a plain to Dushak. No sup- f w S- Ff ^ en ' f ' 0t * te ' Water and fuel at Hodji-Bulan.3 ROUTE N O. xl^h.—concld.

The road is good for camels, but impassable for carts across the Mentug pass. There are numerous flocks jof sheep and goats among the hills, but supplies are scanty, the nomad fimouris only cultivating enough for their own use. Water supply during the march is unreliable, but at Shahnissen is abundant, (Elevation 3,75o')» The road is a good hill track suitable for camels but not for carts. Zorabad, once a large place, is now in a state of decay. It lies in a fertile valley in which there are numerous vil lages: but supplies are scanty, as the nomads are bad cultivators. Water is abundant. (Elevation 2,350'). The road is similar to the last stage: very little water until the Keshaf Rud is reached at Paskamar. Supplies are scanty. Field guns could be got over the pass but not easily. (Elevation 1,700'). The road is good and suitable for wheeled traf fic. Supplies sufficient for a small party only. There is an alternative route from Zorabad to Pul-i-Khatun running along the Hari Rud, the distance being about the same. This al ternative road, however, is less suitable for laden animals, though quickest for a courier. It is broken, and stony, and in places bad.Route No. 77 (a). Section III.
