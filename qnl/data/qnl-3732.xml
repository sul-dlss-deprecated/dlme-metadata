Bridge makes the request because current prevailing winds necessitate the crossing of the line by aircraft.The reply (ff 2-3) from the Political Agent, Cornelius James Pelly, dated 29 March 1947, states that the only information in his office regarding the prohibited zone is from a letter from the Station Superintendent for BOAC, dated 11 December 1940, confirming the location of the prohibition area, of which he encloses an extract. No indication is made as to whether the line marking the prohibited area is still in force or not.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Overseas Airways Corporation</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Airspace (law)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000340#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000340#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
