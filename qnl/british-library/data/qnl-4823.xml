I understand that Bowie had an idea of discussing with you the possibility of having a Consular Agent at Bandar 'Abbas. If the Persian Authorities are likely to place difficulties in the way of the Consul, Kerman, when at Bandar 'Abbas, and to refuse to let him fly his flag, it would be well worth considering whether the appointment of a Consular Agent would not offer a solution of the trouble. « J' J.

K,.y Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to paraf^ranhs 2 and 3 of your Circular Uo.'M dated the 21st November 1931, and to inform you that the Governor of Bandar Ahhas has recently informed the Hirza (Persian Hunshi) there that the Head Clerk at Bandar Ahhas cannot he considered as one of the official staff as no 'British Consulate exists at Bandai Ahhas. the Governor contends that the Head Clerk tails under the category of ’’foreigners residing in Persia” and insists that he should get himself registered mth the local Nazmieh at an early date. p. I heg to request your instructions in this matter.

Sir, 1 have received your despatch ho.35/261 ^une l^th last and have given consideration to the question of the registration of the Head Clerk at the Bandar Abbas Consuls te. P, In all the circumstances it appears to me that much trouble will be saved if he registers with the police as requested. 3. 'he situation at the moment is that the Persian Government have not as vet notified their formal consent to the amalgamation of the Kerman and Bandar Abbas Consulates and that therefore the Bandar Abbas Consulate is still in being, though the post of Consul is unfilled. -he Governor is therefore premature in his arguments but once the amalgamation takes place V seems to me that his view of the position will be correct. 4. It is, however, possible that some degree of recogni tion for the Bandar Abbas office may be secured and in that case it may be possible to approach the Ministry for Foreign Affairs about the position of the Head Clerk. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Honourable ‘fhe Political 'Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire (No.92), I am , Sir, Your most obedient servant, (SignedJ v.A.L.Mallet.

The Residency, r u ^ ^ I Bushire, the ?4th July, 1933, My dear Mallet, Will you kindly refer to your despatch -No. 11, dated the 7th Sfuly 1933, to the Consul, Kennan, regarding the registration of his Head Clerk at Bandar ^hhas. 2. I hope that it will he possible for you to obtain some degree of recognition for the Bandar f Abbas office, as otherwise the Consul, Kennan, nay find himself in an un dignified position when in Bandar T Abbas. .3, If the Head Clerk at Bandar * Abbas of the Consul, Kerman, has to be registered by the Police as a 'foreigner residing in Persia', is it not possible that the .Police will demand that the remainder of the Consul’s staff shall register themselves ( and indeed, logically, the Consul himself l), when they come to Bandar ’Abbas in the winter V The news, that the Staff of our Consulate ( as it will continue to be in the eyes of the local Persian and Arab; have to register with the Police seems likely to arouse comment. 4. 1 do not know whether any enquiry has been made about the Consul, Ker&amp;an, flying his flag when in residence at Bandar ’Abbas. ^owle, 1 know, considered it distinctly preferable that the Consul should fly his flag, but he realised the difficulties and thought that the enquiry which Hoare proposed to make from the -Persian Government appeared to be the only course, that would meet the case. ± hope that you will have aijhappy issue to your enquiry, for i fear that the fact that our .’flag, which has flown in Bandar Abbas/ V.A.1.Mallet, Esquire, H.M.’s Charge’ d’Affaires, British Legation, Teh ran.'Abbas since (T?) 1900, is no longer flov/n, although the Consul (as he v/ill still appear to be) is in residence there, will not be understood. t*he local Persian or Arab wil^hardly grasp the delicate subtleties involved. Put if the Persian Government refuse, it seems imnossible to do otherwise than to accept the situation, as it would be worse still, if the Consul were to hoist his flag and then be forced to take it down again. 5. I appreciate that, in a way, 7/e are in the position of asking the Persian Government for a favour in acquiescing in our arrangements for amalgamating these posts, though they are probably themselves only too delighted to see one British official instead of two in that area { does this not make our position slightly stronger than it appears at first sight ?), but I hope that it may be possible to Consul at Kerman appearing in too humble a role 'Abbas.
