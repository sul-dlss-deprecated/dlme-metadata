Holland, Esq., Political Agent and His Majesty's Consul, Maskat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. CU. IaA ^ A In continuation of my letter No. 452, dated 29th April 1909, regarding Habib bin Sulayim, I have the honour to forward herewith, in original, a letter from Habib to Brahim bin Muhammad bin Juma which has recently come into my possession. 2. Brahim bin Muhammad is one of the Sultan’s confidential secretaries, and it appears that at the request of a third person he wrote to Habib asking if he would sell one of the telephone sets which he was known to have in his possession. Habib in his reply refuses to sell on the ground that the telephones do not belong to him, but are official and the property of the German Emperor. He thus seems to claim for himself the position of a German Agent. 3. It is possible to regard the reference to the German Emperor merely as a device invented by Habib to enable him to shelve an inconvenient request and at the same time to enhance his own prestige, since if he were really a German Agent he would hardly reveal his hand in this way. On the other hand, it must be remembered that the letter is addressed to a person who ordinarily enjoys the Sultan’s confidence and who might be aware of his most secret designs. It is conceivable, therefore, that Habib’s German connection, if it exists, has already been the subject of discussions between himself and the Sultan and that he believed himself to be revealing in this letter nothing which was not already known to the addressee. 4. If so, the matter takes a more serious aspect, for His Highness must \ have been playing a double game for some time past, and may have already committed himself to some extent. I still find it difficult, however, to believe that this is the case; partly because His Highness has given the most positive assurances, both to Major Cox personally and to myself, to the effect that he would inform us at once should he become aware of any German overtures; and partly because Saiyid Faisal is constitutionally unable to keep a secret, and if any political proposi tion had been submitted to him by Habib, I might reasonably expect to hear of it through my usual sources of information. 5. The information which has reached me does not tend to show that Habib has any interest in German politics. A dismissed employe of his who had every reason to bear him ill will possessed no knowledge on the subject and the Sultan, whom I have recently again questioned, has stated positively that Habib has not made any overtures to him which might seem to have a political bearing. Habib has thrown out hints to His Highness to the effect that he is willing to undertake commercial concessions, such as the manage ment of the Customs, the farming of the Zikat or inland transit dues, and the institution of a coasting service of small steamers or launches, but the2 Sultan, according to his own statement, has so far refused to lend an ear to such propositions. Habib has, undoubtedly, a commercial connection with Germany and it is possible that development of his schemes by involving German capital might subsequently afford the German Government an opportunity for Consular intervention. But the Germans already possess a pretext for interference, should they wish to avail themselves of it, in the Wonckhaus Branch at Mutrah. 6 . I am making further confidential enquiries as to the possibility of a secret understanding between Habib and the Sultan, and I will report the result to you. I am unable to request His Highness directly to explain the letter, because the person who gave it to me particularly requested that I should not do so. If it were known that I possessed the letter, the Sultan would at once guess who must have given it to me. From comparison of the handwriting of this letter with another which I possess, written to me by Habib, it seems to me to be a genuine document. I have previously submitted in paragraph 11 of my letter No. 2003-K., dated 2nd July 1909, a suggestion as to the means which might be employed for excluding the possibility of German intrigue in Maskat. (Translation of a letter, dated the 12th Ramazan 1327 = 28th September 1909, from Habib bin Sulayim, Maskat, to Ibrahim bin Muhammad bin Juma, Maskat.) Peace be to you and the mercy of God and His blessings; and thereafter your noble letter reached me, and you have done well. This is what was becoming on your part. But with regard to the telephones which I have . ^ . .« .. . here in my possession, they are in all 10 * (?) telephones, but they do not belong to me. They are official, the property of the German Emperor, and they are not for sale. Be satisfied and farewell. Cl,mm (Conf icier, tia i) (Copy) No. 1116 of 1909.

The courtiers at the Palace on becoming aware of this gorgeous respect which is going to be accorded to this man formed themselves into two factions - one in d favour of the man and the other against him - those in favour admired his loyalty and felt anxious to have him amongst them and the reverse party liad in mind that the mar. would surely rob then of some of the influenceinfluence willcii tliey up-to-date Gnjoy at tlie Palace gav© exit tiiat tli© T!5an f l*ad lossn livlni^ in a i-ferraan Colony at the Con^o, liad been suborned by that Government to attach himself to the Court of 7!uscat to watch tlieir interests.” Go much I could collect from him - I will again see him in two days’ tine.

The particulars which Mr. Thesiger gives regarding Habib bin Sulaiyim are interesting. With reference to the incident mentioned in the last paragraph but one of the letter I would venture to ask whether His Majesty’s Government could be moved to sanction the extension of good offices to Maskat subjects seeking help from British Consular Officers in any country. I am under the impression that such a concession is granted in the case of Afghans and for obvious reasons it is desirable that Maskat subjects should be able to look to our officers for help and protection when abroad. | Copy of confidential letter No. 6 , dated 16 th January igog, from His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Boma t to the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty*s Consult Maskat. With reference to your telegram of the 30th December, I have the honour to inform you that it was unfortunately undecypherable in parts. I gathered however, that you wished to know: “ If I could give you any information regarding two Maskat subjects, Magid bin Said and Habibu bin Selim, the latter of whom recently sent to the Sultan- valuable presents of German merchandise, and who is believed to have left the Congo in October last, and to inform you if they are likely to be German Agents.” I was unable to make out one sentence preceding and one following the last question. I replied that Habibu bin Salim was a well known trader here and Magid bin Said was at one time his Agent. Before leaving the Congo Habibu tried to engage several Europeans for the Sultan's service and that he was in Germany in 1907 . As regards the possibility of his being a Germen Agent I cannot give you any information but will tell you briefly all that I know of him. Habibu bin Salim has lived for many years in the Congo Free State, having his place of residence at Stanleyville. He is I am led to believe a relation of the late well known Sultan Tippoo Tib. He rendered some services to the State during their troubles with the Arabs and was privileged as regards trading facili ties. In 189a Magid bin Said joined the Arabs who were fighting the State- was taken prisoner and sentenced to penal servitude. Habibu who was interested in him obtained his release after three years’ imprisonment and took him as his2 Agent, Magid declares as his partner. About 1906 the two men quarrelled. Magid appears to have robbed Habibu of a quantity of ivory which he sold to a Dutch Trading House, and was supported by a State Agent whom Habibu accused of sharing in the proceeds of the robbery. Whatever was the actual truth Habibu could get no redress though he appealed personally to the Governor. The matter was suppressed and Habibu lost all his ivory. In consequence he went to Belgium but with no success and from there he went on to Germany returning to the Congo In December 1907. I am told that he was financed by a Hamburg Trading House which was interest ed in ivory but of this I have no certain knowledge. In Germany he appears to have passed himself off as a very important person and was disgusted to find in receiving his Hotel bill that they had charged him on the scale reserved for Oriental potentates. On returning to Stanleyville he seems to have determined to abandon the Congo and return to Maskat. At this time he allied himself closely to a Swiss, M. Blanchet, Director of a trading business, an Italian, Dr. Avezza, Medical Officer of the Railway Company and another, whom he tried to persuade to go back with him to Maskat promising them well-paid employment under the Sultan of Oman, They seem to have been much taken with the idea but could not break their contracts. M. Blanchet has since been dismissed and has left the Congo and it is probable that he is in communication with Habibu at this moment. At first these gentlemen used to talk freely of their plans with the English architect employed in building the Stanleyville Vice-Consulate but when Habibu learnt it he made them swear to say nothing more as he said he could not trust the English. He left the Congo about September 1908. Of Magid bin Said I have no recent news and I believed that he was still in Stanleyville and that there was still enmity between him and Habibu. Magid has altogether lost caste as a Muhammadan and drinks. He is unscrupulous and not to be trusted in any way. Habibu has been of late years badly treated by the State who object to private traders, especially when successful, and they have practically robbed him of a great deal of ivory. Habibu appealed to the British Vice-Consul Mr. Michell but it was decided that this Consulate had no standing to intervene in the case of Maskat subjects. This is all I know of these two men, the present Vice-Consul at Stanleyville will be absent for some four months on a journey and I have no one to whom I can trust further enquiries on the spot. G.

I thought it as well to communicate the information regarding Suleiman bin Nasir to His Majesty’s Foreign Office as well as that regarding Habib, in case the two men should prove to have any connection with one another. 3. Such further information as may come to hand will be duly communi cated to the Government of India on receipt. I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copies of the correspondence marginally cited regarding two long-absent Oman subjpcts named Habib bin Sulaiman and [►Suleiman bin Nasir, respectively, in connection, with whose contemplated return to Maskat there is some suspicion, or at all events possibility, of German intrigue being at work. No. 758, dated the 8 th November 1908. From— Captain F. McConaghet, Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty^ Consul, Maskat, To —Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I am putting up a short note regarding Habib bin Sulayim (Seedie). This man left Maskat about 20 years ago. He went to the Congo Free State, West Africa, and is reported to have made a large sum of money by trade, etc. About seven months ago, Habib sent a present to His Highness consisting of 60 boxes containing telephones, lamps, tower-clock, etc. Value of present reported to be about Rs. 35,000. The Sultan has lately received a letter from Habib, in which he state 8 that he has deposited a sum of one lakh of rupees for His Highness. In return he has asked His Highness to lend him a house on arrival and also to give him a suitable plot of ground for building purposes. He also has asked His Highness to give him the Customs, etc. The man is reported to have left Africa on 14th October and should reach Maskat before the end of the year. The man is reported to have dealings in Germany. I have had no opportunity to go into the case, and I have not thought it advisable at the present stage to mention the matter to His Highness. There may be something in it, but this present note will require careful checking. No. 8273, dated Bushire, the 15th November 1908. From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—R. E. Holland, Esq., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat. I have the honour to refer to Captain McConaghey’s communications Nos. 757 and 758. Probably he recorded these notes as he was leaving, in order that the subjects might not be overlooked, hut ordinarily speaking notes in this form are of little advantage unless the Political Agent’s views accompany; and I 3790 F. D.2 shall be glad to receive any observations ycu may have to make in connection with the two under reference. As regards Habib bin Sulayim, it would, I think, be as well for you to ask the Sultan for information about him in a friendly conversation and warn His Highness of the individual’s probable connection with German interests. No. 933, dated Maskat,the 12th December 1908. From— K. E. Holland, Esq., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Mask at, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to your letter No. 3273, dated 15th November 1908, regarding Gopalji Walji’s property and Habib bin Sulayim. 2. I mentioned Habib in conversation with the Sultan yesterday, and His Highness informed me that it is quite true that the man has sent him large presents, that he is coming here in a few months’ time, and that he has asked to be provided with a house. I warned His Highness of Habib’s possible connection with German interests, and His Highness informed me in return that so far he had been able to gather no indication, either from Habib’s letters or from any other source, to the effect that he had any connection with Germany. 3. 1 will address you separately regarding Gopalji’s property. No. 857 8, dated Bushire, the 22nd December 1908. From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Maskat. TVith reference to your letter No. 933, dated 12th December 1908,1 have the honour to request that you will endeavour to ascertain where Habib bin Sulayim’s precise domicile has been of late years, and where he is now. On getting the information, it would seem advisable to ask our nearest represent ative by telegram to furnish full information regarding him. It seems hardly likely that the man would send the Sultan such valuable presents and state that he has deposited a sum of one lakh of rupees for His Highness's enjoyment, unless he had some motive in doing so. No. 189, dated Maskat, the 13th February 1909. From— R. E. Holland, Esq., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat, To —Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to your confidential letter No. 3578, dated the 22nd December 1908, on the subject of Habib bin Sulayim. 2. In accordance with your verbal instructions I submit the following precis of the information available regarding the man. In March 1908 it came to the notice of my predecessor that His Highness the Sultan had received from a Seedie subject of his, by name Habib bin Sulayim, resident in the Congo Free State, a magnificent present consisting of 54 cases containing telephone material, acetylene gas plant, a clock-tower and other articles to the total value of about 1135,000. The articles were of German manufacture and the cases were consigned to His Highness by the Hamburg firm of Warnholtz and Gossler in S.S. Savoia leaving Hamburg about 17th February 1908. 3. In October 1908 my predecessor learnt privately that His Highness had received a letter from Habib in which he offered a lakh of rupees as a present, and mentioned that he hoped shortly to arrive in Maskat. He asked that a house might be placed at his disposal on arrival and that a suitable plot of ground might be given him for building purposes. It was further rumoured3 •Copy enclosed. fSee Diary for 27th December 1908. in the bazar that Habib bad bad dealings with German political agents and that he had asked His Highness to give him the control of the Maskat Customs. 4. In your letter No. 3273,dated 15th November 1908, you instructed me to ask the Sultan about the incident in a friendly way and to warn His Highness of the individual’s probable connection with German interests. I accordingly did so, and His Highness then informed me that the man bad in fact sent him large presents and had asked to be provided with a house on his arrival in Maskat. His Highness bad, however, been able to gather no indication either from Habib’s letters or from any other source implying political connection with Germany. 5. In accordance with your further instructions I telegraphed* to His Bri tannic Majesty’s Consul, Boma, for any information that he might possess regarding Habib and also regarding anotherf Maskat subject Majid bin Said bin Sam also resident in the Congo Free State, who had subsequently written and offered presents to His Highness. From the replyj which I have received it appears that Habib was a well- known trader in the Congo Free State + opy enc ost . that he left the State a short while ago en route for Maskat. Before his departure he is said to have attempted, presumably without success, to engaee Europeans for the service of the Sultan of Maskat. He was in Germany in 1907. The second man, Majid bin Said, is reported by the Boma Consul to have been the agent of Habib. 6. The Sultan has recently had a telegram from Habib announcing his arrival atMombassa. In his reply the Sultan offered Habib passages for himself and his family from Zanzibar to Maskat in the yacht Nur-ul-Bahar which His Highness proposes shortly to send to Zanzibar. Habib will probably reach Maskat next month. On his arrival, I wdll furnish any further particulars that I may be able to obtain regarding him. The Sultan has promised that he will at once inform me if any overtures are made to him by German agents through the medium of Habib, and I regard it as practically certain that no such overtures have yet been made. The fact that Habib’s agent in the Congo Free State has also offered presents to the Sultan seems to suggest that in both cases the offers are the outcome of a not unnatural sentiment of loyalty mixed with a desire to display newly acquired riches. 7. If Habib turns out to be a competent man of business without German leanings, and if he can persuade His Highness to entrust him with the management of the Maskat Customs, the change may be very advantageous for the trade of the place. In order, however, further to elucidate Habib’s connection with Hamburg, I would suggest for consideration that His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at that place should be asked to furnish any information he may be able to procure regarding the man.

I am enquiring further and am telegraphing to Uganda and to the East Africa Protectorate.” I also asked the Consul-General why the Sultan’s yacht was going to Dar-es-Salaam (vide my last diary), but have as yet received no reply. In consequence of a conversation with the Sultan I telegraphed to the Consul-General, Zanzibar, as follows “ I should be very glad of any information regarding a Maskat subject named Suleiman bin Nasir of Suikie who is said to be coming here. The Sultan suspects him of being a German Agent/’ Consul-General replied to-day :— ** Reference your telegram 18th. Suleiman bin Nasiris a very intelligent and influential Arab. He was formerly Wali of Lar-es-Salaam, and still draws a pension from the German Government, I will send further informa tion as to his movements as soon as possible.” I have suggested to the Sultan that if Suleiman applies for permission to come to Maskat, be should be discouraged without any reason being assigned. Telegram P., No. 101, dated the 26th-February 1909. From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—Foreign Office, London. About a year ago the Sultan of Maskat was the recipient of a consignment of presents to the value of £2,000 which had been despatched to him from Europe by order of one Habib bin Sulayim. Habib was formerly a Maskat subject ; but is not personally known to the Sultan. About kO years ago he migrated to Africa, and is said to have made a fortune on the Congo. In view of the possibility of Habib being a German emissary, enauiries were made, and the Sultan was warned to be circumspect. Habib is now at Mombassa, and is said to be about to leave for Maskat. It is reported that be expects to be made Wazir or Customs farmer. No connection with Germany has so far been traced to him in Africa. It has been ascertainedhowever that he was in Germany in 1907, and the consignment of presents above referred to was despatched from Hamburg by the firm of Warnholtz and Gossler in a Hamburg-America steamer about 17th February 1908. I solicit communication of the above information to our Consul-General at Hamburg with instructions to make enquiries regarding the individual and to telegraph the result to me.

We were recently asked by the Sultan of Miskat to obtain information regarding the antecedents of a man named Suleiman bin Nasir, formerly a Maskat subject, who was said to be returning to Maskat from lilast Africa, and whom the Sultan suspected of German proclivities. The Consul-General, Zanzibar, has now wired that tins man is a very intel ligent and influential Arab, that he was formerly Wall of Dar*es-Salaam, and that he still draws a pension from the German Government. The Political Agent, Maskat, is advising the Sultan to discourage Suleiman’s return to Oman. Telegram P., No. 103, dated the 26th February 1909. From— Major P. Z.

In answer to the Resident’s enquiries as to what the facts were, His Hishness stated that the ship was going to Zanzibar in any case to take some of his ladies down in connection with a family marriage now on the tapis, and that in reply to Habib he had telegraphed that he was at liberty to avail himself of the* ship, but asking him to await letter under despatch. In the letter His Highness said he had told Habib that the ship’s movements were uncer tain and that he would probably find it more convenient and comfortable to travel via Bombay by mail. It was agreed that enquiries made regarding this individual had*elicited nothing to his discredit, but His Highness assured6 the Resident that he quite realised the reed for circumspection and would at once exchange with the Political Agent any information that might come to hand.

Boma, January 16, 1909 . ■“n Sir, With reference to your telegram of the 30th December I have the honour to inform you that it was unfortunately undecyphenable in parts. I gathered however that you wished to know : 'If I could give you any information regarding two Muscat subjects Magid bin Said and Habibu bin Selim, the latter of uh om recently sent to the Sultan valuable presents Of German merchandise, and who is believed to have left the Congo in October last , and to inform you if they are likely to be German Agents'. I was unabl to make out one sentence preceding and one following the last question. I replied that Habibu bin Selim was a wellknown trader here and Magid bin Said was at one time his Agent. Before leaving the Congo Habibu tried to engage several Europeans for the Sultan's service and that he was in Germany in lOO'H As regards the possibility of his being a German Agent I cannot give you any information but will tell you briefly all that I know of him. Habibu bin Sdlim has lived for many yeqrrs m Hi e Congo Free State, having his place of residence at Stanleyville. He is I am led to belzevea relation of the late well-known Sultan Tipj.o Tib. He rendered some serv&amp;coe to the State during their troubles with the Arabs and was pnvileged as regards t rad ing fa c i 1 i ties . In 1892 Mag id bin Sa id joz ned the Arabs who were fighting the State, was taKen prisoner'M prisoner and sentenced to penal servitude. Habthu who was interested in him obtfedned his release after three year* imprisonment and tool him as his aaent , Magid declares as bis partner. About 1906 the two men quarrelled. Magid appears to have robbed Habibu of a quantity of ivory which he sold to a Butch trading house y and was supported by a State Agent whom Habibu accused of sharing in the proceeds of the robbery. Whatever yr as the actual truth Habibu could get no redress though he appealed personally to the Governor. The matter was suppressed and Habibu lost all his ivory. In consequence he went to Belgium but with no success and from there he went on to Germany returning to ti\e Congo in December 1907. I am told that he was financed by a Hamburg Trading house which was interested in ivory, but of this I have no certain Knowledge. In Germany he appears to have passed himself off as a very important person and was disgusted to find in receiving his Hotei bill that they had charged him on the scale reserved for Oriental potentates. On returning to Stanleyville he seems to have deter mined to abandon the Congo and re+u^Ti to Muscat. At this time he allied himself closely to a Swiss, M.Blanchet Director of a trading business, an 1+alian Dr Avezza, Medical officer of the railway company and another, whom he tried to persuade to go booh with him to Muscat, promising them vie 11 paid employment under the Sultan of Oman. They seem to have been much toften with the idea (jrJc mt could not breoft- their contracts. M. Blanchet has since been dismissed and has left the Congo and it is probable that he is in comimunication with Habibu at this moment. At first these gentlemen used to talk freely of their plans with the English * architectarchitect employed in building the Stanleyville Vice- Consulate but when Hobihu learnt it he made them swear to say nothing more as he said he could not trust the English. He left the Congo about September 1908. Of Magid bin Scfid I have no recent news and I believed that he was still in Stanleyville and that there was still enmity between him and Habibu. Magid has altogether lost caste as a Mohamedan and dririhs. He is unscrupulous and not to be trusted in any way. Habibu has been of late years badly treated by the State who object to private traders, especially lohen successful, and they have practically robbed him of a great deal of ivory. Habibu appealed to the British Vice-Consul, l T r.Mtohell, but it was decided that this Consulate had no standing to intervene in the case of Muscat subjects. This is all I Know of these two men, the present Vice- Consul at Stanleyville will be about for some four months on a journey and I have no one to whom I can trust further enquiries on the spot.

Grey to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, that Captain Cromie, His Majesty's Consul at Boma, has asked for instructions as to the status of natives of Muscat in the Congo Free State. Although Muscat is in fact an Independent state, it has been the practice of His Majesty's Government in certain countries such as Persia and in certain con ditions to extend to natives of Muscat the treatment accorded to British protected persons. In the ab sence of any special reasons, natives of Muscat would not seem to be entitled to the good offices of His Majesty's Consular Officers in the Congo Free State, but before issuing any definite instructions Sir E.

Sir, We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Secret despatch No. 13 of 5th May 1905, relative to an application made to His Majesty’s Consul at Aleppo by two supposed natives of Maskat for registration. 2. In reply, we transmit copies of correspondence with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and with the Political Agent at Maskat, which explain the circumstances in which the documents referred to were granted. The document issued by His Majesty’s Consul in regard to Hai Mahmed-bin-Ahmed was merely a recommendation for good offices, and expressly says that he is an Omani subject. Major Grey’s action therefore in this case does not seem to call for any remarks. As regards Shadad-bin-Nusaf, there seems no doubt that Major Grey’s action was irregular, in view of the fact that that individual, being a subject of the Sultan of Maskat, clearly failed to satisfy the conditions necessary to entitle him to he certified as a British-protected person. 3. In answer to Major Grey’s request for instructions, we propose to inform him through the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (1) that he should on no account give a certificate of registration to any person who cannot prove British nationality or the status of a subject to a Ruler under British ^ protection, his conduct in cases of the latter kind to he regulated by the 4/0 3 * 5 principles laid down in your despatches Nos. 55 (Political) of 23rd June 1905 and 67 (Political) of 30th June 1905; (2) that such personal requests as Major Grey refers to as being made by the Sultan in the case of Shadad-hin-Nusaf) should be met by the grant of letters of recommend ation, due care being taken to grant even these with discrimination and for thoroughly good reasons only. In order that there may he no mistake as to their purport and intention, the letters of recommendation should be issued in such a form as cannot be mistaken for a certificate of any sort, preferably in the form of a letter addressed to one or more of His Majesty’s Consular officers.4 .

The Baluch Shadad bin Nasaf came to Maskat from Syria in November last, and after explaining his circumstances to me desired to be registered as a British subject. He was unable to prove to my satisfaction that he’had a right to be considered as such, little or no evidence beyond his own statements were forthcoming, and as he had undoubtedly been born in Matrah I did not consider myself justified in assuming him to be other than a subject -of the Sultan of Maskat. I therefore dismissed his application. Two days later Shadad was sent to me by His Highness with a request that I would give him a certificate which would entitle him to protection equal to that enjoyed by our own subjects. I replied that I would not do this without instructions and offered to refer the case to the Government of India. After further discussion with His Highness during which I was informed that the man had made all arrangements to leave on the following day, I agreed in the cir cumstances to register him as a“ British protected person ” noting specifically on the certificate, in order to avoid possible future difficulites, that such action had only been taken at His Highness the Sultan s request. The latter express ed his gratitude and satisfaction. Case (II). The document granted in this case is a non-committal one it amounts only to a request for such good offices as His Majesty s Consul might feel able to give. 3 . As similar requests for British protection as that recorded in connection with case (1) will probably be made by His Highness the Sultan in future, take this opportunity of soliciting instructions as to what action shouM be taken thereon in case I have over-estimated the amount of protection which it is con sidered desirable to afford to Maskat subjects. 4. The remarks contained in paragraph 2 of Foreign Office Circular, dated 3rd July 1893 (Treaty,) dealing with spheres of influence would appear to be of interest in this connection.Enclosure No. 3. f Confidential.)

In reply to your letter No. 3157 E.-B., dated 17th August 1905, I have the honour to forward copies of Foreign Office circular despatches (Treaty) of 3rd July 1893 and 22nd May 1905, with the question and answer to which they refer. 2. In paragraph 2 of the circular of July 1893, reference is made to “British spheres of influence”, and I thought that probably His Majesty’s Government would he prepared to consider Maskat as being such a sphere, and to afford protection to the subjects of the Sultan, at his direct request, except in case of a question arising with any Power by whom British influence in Maskat is not recognised, should such Power raise an objection. I therefore referred to this circular. 3. So far as I can ascertain, this is the second occasion only on which His Highness the Sultan has made a direct request for a protection certificate to be granted to one of his subjects. The first was in the case of one of his subjects residing at Chahbar, to whom a certificate similar to that granted by me in the case of Shadad was given after consultation with Major Cox. Recently, however. His Highness sent me a list of 114 of his subjects, also residents of Chahbar, asking that they may be granted similar protection. Upon this request I am naturally taking no action, pending the receipt of a decision in regard to the present case. 4. A copy of this letter will be forwarded to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Circular. ^ Treaty. Foreign Office, 3rd July 1893. Sir, I am directed by the Earl of Roseberry to transmit to you herewith, for vour information and guidance, copies of a letter which has been received from Mr. R. B. Martin, M.P., and of the answer which has been returned to him, after consultation with the Law Officers of the Crown, as to the assistance and protection to be afforded by Her Majesty’s Diplomatic and Consular Officers to natives and vessels of a foreign State, such as North Borneo, which is uncer British protection, and the conduct of whose foreign relations is under the control of Her Majesty’s Government. The answers given to Mr. Martin’s enquiries, with reference to natives of a State under British protection, apply equally to the case of natives of a British sphere of influence, with this modification, that Her Majesty s Govern ment cannot, as of right, claim to represent such a native at all in the case of a question arising with any Power which has not by Treaty or Agreement recognised the said sphere of influence.

Dear Sir Edward Grey, The question that I want to ask the Eoreign Office (I need not trouble you with it in the House) is, “ Has the citizen of a protected State, e.g., British North Borneo, a right to claim the services and protection of a British Consul or Consular Agent, exactly as if he was a subject of the British Crown, both for himself and for a ship sailing under (e.g.) the British North Borneo flag ” ?

Sir, I am directed by the Earl of Rosebery to inform you that the question submitted in your letter to Sir Edward Grey of the 27th Eebruary last, as to the assistance and protection to which natives of British North Borneo, and ships sailing under the British North Borneo flag, are entitled, has been carefully considered, and I am now to reply as follows :—■ The natives of a foreign State which, as in the case of North Borneo is under British protection, and the conduct of whose foreign relations is under the control of Her Majesty’s Government, are considered by Her Majesty’s Government to be entitled, when out of their own native country, to the general assistance and protection of Her Majesty’s Diplomatic and Consular Officers, but so far only as the action of such officers is not founded either on British statutes or on treaties which refer only to British subjects. (A native of a State under British protection cannot, so far as the applica tion of such statutes or treaties is concerned, be considered to be a British subject.) They are also entitled to be considered British-protected persons for the purposes of civil or criminal jurisdiction in countries, other than their native country, where Her Majesty has and exercises extra-territorial jurisdiction, except in so far as such jurisdiction depends upon treaty or capitulation refer ring only to British subjects. Ships flying the flag of a British-protected State, whose foreign relations are entrusted to Her Majesty’s Government, may reasonably claim, and Her Majesty’s Diplomatic and Consular Officers may extend to them general assistance and protection ; but where the right of interference of the officer is founded upon the statute or treaty referring only to British ships, it cannot be extended to the ships of a protected State. I am, &amp;c., T. H. Sanderson. Circular. Treaty. Eoreign Office, 22nd May 1905. Sir, On the 3rd July 1893, a circular (treaty) despatch was, by direction of the Earl of Roseberry, addressed to His Majesty’s Consular Officers abroad,3 © enclosing, for their information and guidance, a copy of correspondence Tvitli Mr. R,. B. Martin, M.P., respecting the assistance and protection to be afforded by His Majesty’s Diplomatic and Consular Officers to natives and vessels of a foreign State which is under British protection, and the conduct of whose foreign relations is under the control of His Majesty’s Government. Questions have recently arisen with regard to the correct interpretation to be placed on paragraph 1 of the letter to Mr. Martin of the 21st June 1893 (enclosure No. 2 in the circular despatch above referred to). I am therefore directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to inform you that His Majesty’s Government consider that the same measure of protection may properly be extended to British-protected persons abroad as to British subjects, except in so far as the right or power to exercise such protection depends upon a Treaty, Agreement, or Statutory Enactment which excludes, or cannot be construed as including, such “ protected persons When the whole control of the foreign relations of a State has been assumed by His Majesty’s Government, it is apparent that the duty of pro tecting the natives or subjects of that State in other countries must also be assumed. What measure of protection can be given must depend upon the extent of the jurisdiction enjoyed by His Majesty’s Government in the country where the protection is desired. It is only where that jurisdiction is confined to those who are, in the strict technical sense of our municipal law, British subjects, that it cannot be exercised in respect of protected persons.

My Lord:* I have the honour to request the favour of Your Lordship's instructions in the following matter: A few months ago two Indians presented themselves at the Vice-Consulate of Adana and applied to be regis tered as British Subjects. They were respectable men with farms and had been several years in the country. They had no documents of any kind to shew their nation ality and had taken no steps in the matter before. Captain Townshend therefore declined to recommend them to me for registration unless they produced proof. They then left Adana and three months later returned, bringing documents of which I have the honour to for ward copies herewith.

The general question of the status of Brilish-protected persons in foreign countries formed the subject of my Political Despatch No. 55 of the 23rd June 1905. It will he seen, from the correspondence now forwarded, that, in view of the opinion which has been recorded by the Law Officers of the Crown, Omar Basar is held to he entitled to receive the passport for which he has applied. I would, however, invite your special attention to the considerations set forth in paragraphs 3-5 of the Foreign Office letter of the 6th June 1905, which should guide the British local officials in dealing with such applications for British protection ; and I request that your Excellency will issue such instruc tions as you may think necessary for the due observance, in any case that may arise, of the principle laid down. 3. As regards the particular application of Omar Basar, there is no objection to the grant of a passport to him, unless it is considered expedient to withhold it, in view of the considerations discussed in the two concluding paragraphs of the India Office letter of the 8th March 1905. I have the honour to he, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) St. John Brodrick.ENCLOSURES. Sir, Dated 26th January 190o. enquiring whether there granting to Omar Basar, is anv one of Secretary’s Enclosure No. 1. India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, 8th March 1905. With reference to Sir Horace Walpole’s letter of the 24th August 1903 on the subject of the claim of certain natives of Shehr and MokalJa to he registered as British protected persons at Hodeida, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Brodrick to enclose, for Lord Lansdowne’s information, a copy of a telegram* from the Government of India objection to the Resident at Aden the natives of Sheln: and Mokalla f Enclosures in Foreign Secretary’s a ^ OVe , referred to, a passport to letter, dated 26th January 1905.

I am also to enclose n Copy of papersf received from the Government of India on the subject. -from the papers now sent it seems clear to Mr. Brodrick that Omar Basar is a person who is prima facie entitled to British protection ; but I am to observe that our officers by attempting to extend such pro tection to him might raise at Hodeida the general question, which has .lust been referred to the Law Officers of the Crown, as to our right in places like the Ottoman Dominions to extend British protection to the subjects of states over w Inch we exercise a protectorate, and I am to add that if that question were raised in this particular case, the prospect of our getting the lurkish authorities to admit our claims would be diminished by the circumstances that Omar Basar is a subject of one of the Hadramaut States, and is, moreover, at this moment on had terms with the Turkish local officials. It may be that the facts that Omar Basar has, for his own purposes, abstained for so many years from seeking the protection of the British Consulate at Ilodeida and allowed himself to he regarded as an Ottoman subject, and that he applies for British protection only now, when he has fallen out Aiith the Turkish officials, should he considered to disentitle him to British protection or, at least, to justify some delay on our part in acceding to bis application for it, but that is a point for the consideration of the Foreign Office. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. I am, &amp;c., A. Godley. Enclosure No. 2. Foreign Office to India Office. Foreign Office, SiL 6th June 1905. The Marquess of Lansdowne has had under his consideration your letter ot the 8th of March last, in which you request an expression of his Lordship’s views as to whather the Resident at Aden should be authorised to grant to one Omar Basar, a native of Shehr and Mokalla, a British passport to Hodeidah. 16059. a 2The question of principle involved in your letter was dealt with in the report from the Law Officers of the Crown, which was communicated to the India Office on the 22nd ultimo. In view of their opinion Lord Lansdowne agrees with Mr. Secretary Brodrick that the man Omar Basar is entitled to receive the passport which Lie Aden authorities are apparently willing to grant to him. ^ , His Lordship considers that the question raised in the last paragraph of your letter is one which can he more readily answered by the British local officials than by this Department. If a man who is entitled to British protection refrains from applying for such protection for a long period, the delay may doubtless afford reasonable ground for refusing to extend it to him supposing always that the British local officials consider such a course to be desirable, but, if they are not of this opinion, the protection need not necessarily be On the other hand such British protection should be limited to events occurring after the grant of the British passport, and the grantee should not he allowed, by obtaining recognition as a British protected person, to escape the consequences of his actions while he was content to hold the position of an Ottoman subject.

From ditto, dated 22nd May 1905 (with enclosures). 2. Your Excellency will see that, acting upon the advice of the Law Officers of the Crown, the Secretary of State tor Foreign Affairs lias issued circulai^despatches to His Majesty’s representatives abroad explaining the terms of the circular Despatch of the 3rd July 1893, and informing them that His Majesty s Government consider that the same measure of protection may properly be extended to British-protected persons abroad as to Biitish subjects, except in so far as the right or power to exercise such protection depends upon a treaty, agreement, or statutory enactment, which excludes, or cannot be construed as including, such protected persons. It is pointed out that the measure of the protection which may be accorded must depend upon the extent of the jurisdiction enjoyed by His Majesty’s Government in the country where the protection is desired. With regard, however, to the Ottoman Dominions, His Majesty’s Government hold that there is nothing in the Capitulations to prevent them from placing British-protected persons on the same footing as British subjects in the matter of jurisdiction; and they consider that the Ottoman Order in Council of 1899 in its definition of British subjects plainly asserts this right, which has not been disputed by the Turkish Government. 3. Adverting to the 7th paragraph of your Excellency’s letter under i cplj } I agree with your Government in the view that the conclusion of 16021. 1.1118. a 1 * : 1formal agreements with the Native States on this subject is unnecessary and undesirable.

Government of India to Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, No. 1739 F., dated 8th October 1894. forward, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the enclosed copy of a letter from the Government of India, No. 65, dated 17th March 1904, and its enclosures, together with the connected papers* noted in the margin, and to make the iollowing remarks. 2. It nill he observed that the Government of India in their letter not only submit their views upon certain points which have been raised regarding the status in Turkish Arabia of persons who are subjects of the Native States in India, but further take occasion to discuss the wider question as to the principles which should govern the status of such persons in foreign countries generally, and it seems to Mi. Brodrick most convenient to consider this wider question first. 3. In reference to it I am to say that Mr. Brodrick concurs generally with the Goiernor-General in Council in the desire to see the subjects of The pi otected states of India treated abroad with the same consi deration as the British Indian subjects of His Majesty, and ho agrees entirely with the opinion that for this no formal consent of the rulers of those states is needed, nor is it desirable to seek it. But on the other hand it must he borne in mind that, though in recent times the British Government has, owing to the exigencies of the position, drawn to itself the exercise of the entire external sovereignty and of particular portions (in some instances even the gnat hulk) of the internal soveieignty of the Indian Ruling Chiefs, yet the British Parliament, the British Indian legislatures, the Courts in England and India, and the British authorities, political and administrative, have, down to the present moment, continued to treat the territories of those Chiefs as states lying beyond His Majesty’s dominions, and the people of those territories ns being the subjects of those Chieis and not British subjects in the proper sense, though they or their rulers may he said to owe to the British Crown loyalty or allegiance in the wide meaning of these words. I am to add that Mr. Brodrick is advised that a definition of British subject,” like that in Clause 3 of the Ottoman Order of 1899, referred to hy the Government of India, involves no departure from that view— that it is merely a device adopted hy the draftsman with a view to convenience of drafting in a case where those responsible for the Order consider that His Majesty has in some w r ay or other acquired as against a foreign state the right to exercise within its territories, in icspect of the subjects of Indian Native States, the same powers that He possesses in respect of British subjects. Its effect is not to convert the subjects of those states into British subjects, hut simply to put them, for the particular purposes of the Order, and in so far as an Order of the kind can do so, on the same footing as British subjects.4. This being the position, it appears to Mr. Brodrick that Lord Elgin’s Government were right in holding, in their letter of the 8th October 1894 (referred to in paragraph 2 of the Government of India’s letter now under consideration), that Sir T. Sanderson’s letter to Mr. Martin of the 21st June 1893 governed the case ot subjects of Indian ^Native States in countries like the Ottoman dominions, and that it is, irom the very nature of the position, impossible for us, in dealing with such persons, to escape from the limitations mentioned in Sir T. Sanderson’s letter. 5. It does not, however, I am to say, follow from this that the subject of an Indian Native State would, when in a foreign country, be left without adequate protection. Having regard to the relations existing between the British Government and the Native States, the subject of a Native State would, M r . Brodrick presumes, he in a pos tion to claim from us in any foreign country, whether in the Eastern or in the Western world, at least full “ pioteetion’’ in the more limited and proper sense in u Inch the word is usually understood in States of the Western type, subject only to the exception as to statutory provisions mentioned hv Sir T. Sanderson, which, in the case of the subject of a Native State, would not be likely to be imp )rtant, nor could our diplomatic and consular agents icfuse to extend such protection to him, except in circumstances in which they would deny it to a British subject. Furtlmr, as our claim to extend protection of this sort to the subject ot a Native State stands on grounds independent of any sort of concession by a foreign state, Mr. Brodrick presumes that no foreign state would be likely to dispute it. G. Assuming this to be so, it would be only in regard to the further measure of protection exercise l in foreign states of the Eastern type that is to say in regard to special privileges, the right to exercise extensive foreign jurisdiction and the like, W which we should have to rely on treaty, capitulation, grant, usage, sufferance, and so forth, that there would be room for any question, and it would be impossible ^ o sua , w ithout rna king detailed inquiries, in what foreign countries and in regard to what classes of persons under onr protection, our claim to exercise this further measure of protection has been, or is likely to be, disputed, and bow far hardship or inconvenience has arisen, or is likelv to arise, from this. It may be that there are places where our claim has not yet been recognised, and where it would be desirable for us to assert it or press for a concession; but Mr. Brodrick would be averse to the formulation of any principle which would commit us to taking this course everywhere, and in regard to all classes of persons under our protection. No doubt, as a rule, the grounds on which such a claim is recognised in the case of His Majesty’s subjects, apply equally in the case of persons under His Majesty’s protection, but this'may not always be so. Again, there are classes of persons entitled to our protection, but who do not choose to claim it, and whom it may be best to leave to their own devices. Further, there are some tribes on the confines of India whom we regard as in some sense under our protection, or at least within our sphere of influence, but whose position with reference to us is not as yet clearly defined, and in regard to which questions of difficulty might arise. For these reasons Mr. Brodrick would prefer to ivait and deal with each case as it arises with reference to its particular circumstances. 7. To turn now to the questions raised in Baghdad. Mr. Brodrick thinks it is by no means improbable, having regard to what is said in the enclosures to the Government of India’s letter, and in the letter of the 22nd February 1904 from the Judge of the Supreme Consular Court at Constantinople, that any objections which have been raised to our claim to exercise, in respect to subjects of the Indian Native States andothers under our protection, the powers and jurisdiction which th£ Ottoman Order in Council of 1899 assumes us to possess, are simply the result of the ignorance or want of intelligence of the Turkish local officials; and the course he would accordingly propose to take, unless indeed Lord Lansdowne feels any doubt as to the correctness of the assumption made in the Order in Council, is to request the Govern ment of India to instruct the Consul-General at Baghdad that if in the ordinary course any case of the subject of an Indian Native State or other protected person comes before him to which the Order in Council applies, and which seems to him in other respects a proper one to he dealt with under that Order, he should not hesitate so to deal with it; and that if any serious difficulty is raised by the local officials he should consult the Judge of the Supreme Consular'Court. 8. The questions referred to in the correspondence as to the acquisition by persons under British protection of the Turkish nationality, and as to the holding of land by persons who have not acquired that nationality, are collateral matters, as to which Mr. Brodrick does not propose to issue any instructions unless they should present themselves in a more definite shape ; hut seeing that the Turks possess a regular naturalisation law, the former question ought to be a simpler one than it is in other Oriental countries. I have, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, A. Uodley. Foreign Office. Annex. Memorandum by Legal Adviser, India Office. It must, I think, be admitted that there are good reasons why subjects of Native States should, when found in foreign countries, enjoy the same measure of protection as is accorded to British subjects. The matter is discussed in Hall/s Treatise on Foreign Jurisdiction, Section 100, and the view taken by him is similar to that urged by the Government of India. Nor do I see any objection to the proposal which is made as well with reference to subjects of Native States in India as to subjects of other protectorates, provided that it is clearly understood that it is only in foreign countries that they are deemed to be British subjects. It is another question whether foreign governments are bound to treat as British subjects persons wdio do not really come within that designation. That must, I think, depend on the terms of the treaty or other understanding between the British Government and the govern ment concerned. I can hardly think that the expression “ subject of England ” was when originally used in the Capitulations intended to include subjects of protected states, but I presume that the expression has since been understood to have that extended meaning, or that other wise tire Ottoman Government has consented to extend to such persons privileges originally conceded to British subjects only. I presume that this must be so, for otherwise the term “ British subject ” used in the Order in Council of 1899 could not well have had assigned to it the meaning given in Clause 2. I suggest that it should be ascertained how it came to have that meaning assigned to it. I would also suggest that it may be desirable to ascertain in what respects subjects of Native States are at a disadvantage as compared with natives of British India, whether they are at a disadvantage in Tnatters other than those to which the Order in Council relates, and whether the certificate given under that Order is ever questioned by the Ottoman authorities.

Memorandum by Mr. Hurst on India Office Letter of 7th Julv 1904. •/ I ha\e had to keep these papers a long time, as they have involved a considerable amount of study on somewhat difficult questions. Tin.* proposal to which the India Office ask Lord Lansdowne to agree is contained in paragraph 7 ol their letter, and is in substance that the Consul-General at Baghdad should he instructed that in ordinarv cases where he considers it proper to do so, he should treat the subjects of Indian native states and other British protected persons as British (Paper J.) subjects, adopting in this respect the same position as the Ottoman Order in Council 1899. lo this proposal I think agreement should be expressed, but the letter and its enclosures discusses the general status abroad of British-protected persons, and I do not think we can avoid offering observations on the general questions raised. It is impossible to compare the letter from the Government, of India to tin* India Office with that from the India Office to tliis Office without seeing that there is a considerable diver gence between them, ami speaking for myself, I think the measure of protection to be afforded abroad to natives of the Protected States in India is hotter defined in the letter of the Government of India than in that to which we must now reply. It is well to bear in mind that the question involved affects not only the inhabitants of the Native states in India but the inhabitants of all the British Protectorates as well. Beference is made in both the letters under review and also in other j } of the enclosures to a circular ' 1&gt;n ’ issued by this Office in 189;J, with regard to the measure of protection to be afforded to natives and vessels of a foreign state, such as North Borneo, which is under British protec tion. Both parties have felt that the limitations described in it must also apply to the natives of the Protected States in India. This p t tt circular was based on a Law apei Officers’ opinion obtained in view of certain questions which a director of the British North Borneo Com pany had put to Sir E. Grey soon after our protectorate of that territory had been declared. The Law Officers’ Report dealt with the status abroad of natives of protectorates and spheres of influence generally, and laid it down that a native of the former was entitled to Brdish protec tion abroad from Consular Officers except in so far as the action of such officers is founded on statutes or treaties referring only to British subjects, and they added that such a native cannot be considered to be a British subject so far as the application of such treaties or statutes is concerned. This latter statement, which is embodied also in the circular, is, I think, liable to misapprehension, and I am inclined to think it has been misunderstood. It must be read in connection with the previous sentence and in that previous sentence I think that British subject is used in its technical sense. There are some treaties under which Consuls act where the word “British subject'’ is not used at all; certainly one and perhaps _ , T . more (Muscat 1873, Siam 1899) v ^ ' where the word has been ex tended by agreement to include some who are only protected persons, and others where it has certainly been treated by both the contracting parties as not having been em ployed in its technical sense, c.g, Zanzibar (1886).I cannot think that the Law Officers intended that the words “British subjects” in such treaties should be construed in a sense different from that intended by the parties. The limitation contained in the Law Officers’ opinion, and repeated in the circular only, I think, amounts to this, that the Secretary of State cannot confer on protected persons abroad benefits which by statute or treaty are restricted to those who are British subjects according to the technical meaning of that word in English law, tfu/., a Zanzibari cannot he treated as a British subject for Foreign the purposes of the Uganda be registered as a British subject in Siam, as the latter would be contrary to the Agreement (Paper N.) Marriage Act, nor can a native of (Paper L ) of 1899. It seems to me that the position in law of British protected persons abroad may be summarized as follows : that the Secretary of State is entitled to extend to them the same measure of protection as to British subjects, except in so far as the terms of either a treaty or a law prevent it, but that, not being British subjects, they are not entitled to such protection as of right, and the Secretary of State may, if he think fit, treat them differently. This is, I think, consistent with the view the Law Officers enter tained in 1893; and it approximates to the status of the natives of German Protectorates as defined by Count Metternich in his commu nication of 17th August of this year : “ Natives in the German “ Protectorates have accordingly, even as regards their persons, no “ share in those rights which the German laws grant to German “ nationals (Pt,eiehsangeborigen) as such. They are therefore not “ ‘ Reichsangehoi igen ’ in this more restricted legal sense. From the “ point of view of International Law, however, as being subjects of “ of the Empire, they are considered as ‘ Angehorigen ’ thereof in the “ broader sense, and as such have a claim to Imperial protection even “ outside the Protectorate.” The view I have indicated above appears to me to provide adequately the elasticity which paragraph 6 of the India Office letter shows to be necessary, as it leaves the Secretary of State a discretion as to what measure of protection to afford : it also leaves no scope for friction with the local sovereign, as the decision rests wholly with the Secretary of State, and it is only where there is a distinct limitation in the terms of the treaty to that effect, that the local sovereign can claim that protected persons should be treated differently to British subjects. It also obviates all necessity for any special or further agreements being concluded with the Indian feudatory princes, a step the Indian Government deprecates. Applying these principles States in India, it will, in limitation on the power of the Secretary of State to place them on the same footing in the Ottoman Dominions as British subjects in the matter of protection and jurisdiction. There is nothing that I can see in the Capitulations to show that to the case of the natives of protected mv opinion, be found that there is no (Paper P.) that word is used in the (Paper O.) British which of the period of the “the .tingiisii' means subjects” in the sense in Naturalisation Act, 1870. The date Capitulations is 1641, a anterior to the formation precise rules about British natiouality that now obtain. Further, I think it is quite impossible to read Articles XXXIII.-IY. of the Capitulations without seeing that there was no intention in the mind of the Forte to limit the privileges of that treaty to the “ English,” in any narrow sense, for the preamble to Article XXXIV. expressly allows the merchants of Spain, Portugal, &amp;c. and all other16021. C merchant strangers” to have recourse to the protection of the English Consuls. Lastly, in their opinion of 18th August 1904, the present Law Officers distinctly laid it down that persons aper might he entitled to the benefit of the Capitulations who arc not British subjects in the technical sense. I think it is clear from the above that there is nothing in the terms of the Capitulations to prevent the full measure of protection being afforded to British protected persons that is given to British subjects. 1 agree with the view expressed in the India Office letter that the inclusion of “ British protected person ” in the term “ British subject ” in the Ottoman Order in Council 1899 does not convert them into British subjects, but it is to my mind a most distinct assertion of the right of His Majesty as against the Porte to place British protected persons on the same footing as British subjects. It must not be forgotten that the right of these Kashmiris and others to protection could not be challenged by the Porte if Kashmir were annexed and incorporated in the British dominions. The Native States in India enjoy their present position merely because it is part of the policy of the Indian Government not to annex; but if that policy were reversed, and annexation of the Native States decided on, no foreign Power would be allowed to raise objections, and the treatment to be accorded to their inhabitants when abroad appears to me to be a matter equally outside the scope of foreign interference, whether such States are annexed or not. With regard to registration, I think the same policy might be suggested as has been adopted for China, viz., that protection and registration should go together. If a Kashmiri settling in the Ottoman dominions prefers to identify himself with the Native population and to refrain from claiming whatever rights to British protection he may have, I see no reason why he should not be allowed to ; but if lie does, he should not be permitted to demand British protection the moment he gets into trouble and needs consular assistance. He should not be recognized (in the absence of exceptional circumstances) until he has registered himself, and protection should be limited to events subsequent to the registration. C. J. B.

Constantinople, 11th December 1904. y\Tth reference to your Despatch No. 65, of the 21st October, and more especially to the last paragraph of the letter to the Govern ment of India enclosed therein, recording the registration ot an Afghan I would draw your attention to the Embassy circulars to Consuls ot 12th May 1890 and 30th November 1891, respecting the extent to which persons of Afghan nationality are entitled to British protection in the Ottoman dominions. I transmit herewith copies of these circulars for facility of reference, and I would be glad if you would adhere to the instructions contained therein so long as they have not been superseded. . With regard to the more general question raised in your Despatcnes No. 42 of 21st July, and No. 65, of the amount of protection to beaccorded to subjects of States under British protection, His Majesty’s Embassy have not received any intimation from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs modifying the instructions contained in his circular of 3rd July 1893 (quoted in tne Government of India’s letter to Mr. Secretary Brodrick of 17th March last) which must accordingly guide their action should any question of this nature be brought before them. T have no doubt that the great caution and tact enjoined on you by the Government of India in dealing with this matter will deter you from taking any avoidable action likely to raise any awkward discussion with the Ottoman authorities as to the status in Turkey of the category of persons in question, more especially until His Majesty’s Government have expressed their views in reply to the Government of India’s representations.

In order that all doubt on the subject may be removed, I beg to inform you that you are hereby instructed to extend to subjects of the Amir sojourning in the Ottoman Empire your unofficial countenance and protection whenever needed. Such protection would not give them the right to claim the benefit of the capitulation between Great Britain and Turkey, but it would entitle them, ns British protected persons, to receive British passports, and to have the aid and support of His Majesty’s Consular officers in any difficulties whicli tiiey might have with the Ottoman authorities. Those who were originally Afghans by race, and are now subjects of the Empress of India, will be entitled to the full enjoyment of rights which belong to such subjects in His Majesty the Sultan’s dominions, and to the full benefit of the capitulations, and the exercise of such rights is distinctly claimed for them. Your action in matters affected by this Circular will consequently be guided by these instructions. You will communicate a copy of these instructions to the Consular officers under your orders.

In reply, I am to say that Mr. Secretary Brodrick would merely suggest, for Lord Lansdowne’s consideration, that in point 1 of the reference to the Law' Officers of the Crown the words “ placed upon it in Mr. Hurst’s Memorandum, viz.,” should be omitted; and that for the words “terms of either a Treaty or a British Statute prevent it,’ the following words should be substituted, viz., “right or power to “ exercise such protection depends upon a Treaty, Agreement, or Law, “ which excludes or cannot be construed as including such protected “ persons,” He w^ould, further, observe with regard to the reference in Mr. Hurst’s Memorandum to the Muscat Agreement of 1873, that Article 2 of the existing Muscat Treaty of 1891 expressly states that subjects of Native States in India shall, for the purposes of that Treaty* be regarded as British subjects.

I have the honour, by direction of the Marquess of Lansdowne, to transmit to you a letter from the India Office and its enclosures, together with the other papers noted in the accompanying list* which . , • tt, i o relate more particularly to the * *SeeAnnex 1 in Enclosure 2. .. „ . , * . question ot the status m the Ottoman dominions of subjects of the Native States in India. The wider question of the status of such persons in foreign countries generally is also discussed. It will be seen from Enclosure 2 in the India Office letter (Paper C.) that Major Newmarch, Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and Consul-General at Bagdad, has recently referred, for the consideration of the Government of India, certain cases arising within his jurisdiction involving questions as to the Courts before which such persons should he tried, the administration of their estates, and generally as to the deii-ree of protection which should be accorded them. A further despatch from Major Newmarch of the fth April 1904 (Paper D), incloses the opinion of the Judge of the Supreme Court at Constantinople on these points. The views of the Government of India, both on the questions thus raised and also on the wider question of the protection in foreign countries of the subjects of Indian Native States, are fully set forth in their letter of the 17th March 1904 (Paper B). A note by the Legal Adviser, India Office, of the 13th May 1904 (Paper E), is also enclosed; while the views and suggestions of the Secretary of State for India in Council are contained in the India Office letter of the 7th July 1904 (Paper A), which, in. forwarding the above correspondence, encloses in addition correspondence winch had passed between the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and the Government of India in 1893-1894 (Paper E), when the matter was previously under consideration. A memorandum, which has been drawn up by Mr. Hurst, Assistant Legal Adviser to this Department, is also enclosed (Paper G). The further papers (H to Q) aie those referred to in the foregoing correspondence. I have the honour to request that you will be good enough to take these papers into your consideration, and that you will favour Lord Lansdowne with your opinion on the following points:— 1. Whether the opinion of your predecessors expressed in their Report of the 8th June 1893 (Paper H), paragraph 1, bears the interpretation : That the Secretary of State is entitled to extend to British-protected persons abroad the same measure of protection as to British subjects except in so far as the right or power to exercise which protection depends upon a treaty, agree ment, or law which excludes £ ‘ or cannot he construed as including such protected persons,” hut that not being British subjects, they are not entitled to such protection as of right; 2. Whether, having regard to the terms of the capitulations, the Secretary of State has the power to place such persons on the same footing in the Ottoman dominions as British subjects in the matter of protection and jurisdiction. 16021. DHis Lordship will also be glad to be favoured with any observations of a general nature which you may desire to offer upon the papers now submitted to you. I am to add that this reference has been submitted to the Secretary of State for India in Council for his observations, and that Mr. Brodrick concurs in its terms. I have, &amp;c., The Law Officers of h. A. Campbell. The Crown. Annex 2. Law Officers’ Keport. ]. We do not think that our predecessors in their Report of the 8th June 1893, laid down that British-protected persons abroad were not entitled as of right to protection, and, in our opinion, British-protected persons are so entitled. When the whole control of foreign relations has been assumed by His Majesty’s Government it appears to us that the duty of protection follows. What measure of protection can be given must depend upon the extent of the jurisdiction enjoyed by His Majesty’s Government in the country where the protection is desired. If that jurisdiction is confined to those who an;, in the strict technical sense of our municipal law, British subjects, it cinnot be exercised in respect of protected persons. 2. We see nothing in the capitulations to prevent the Secretary of State from placing British protected persons on the same footing in the Ottoman dominions as British subjects in the matter of protection and jurisdiction, and we think that the Ottoman Order in Council of 1899, in its definition of “ British subject,” plainly asserts this right which, so far as we know, has not been disputed by the Porte. 3. We think that the right asserted in the Order in Council to treat protected persons in the Ottoman dominions as on the same footing with British subjects should be adhered to. R. B. Finlay.

On the 3rd July 1893,* a Circular (Treaty) despatch was _ addressed by the Earl of Rosebery KO i£'hZlZf nS *' 1894 ’ t0 His Majesty's Representatives abroad, inclosing for their in formation and guidance a copy of correspondence with Hr. R. B. Martin, M.P., respecting the assistance and protection to be afforded by His Majesty’s Diplomatic and Consular Officers to natives and vessels of a foreign state which is under British protection, and the conduct of whose foreign relations is under the control of His Majesty’s Government. Questions have recently arisen with regard to the correct interpretation to be placed on paragraph 1 of the letter to Mr. Martin of the 21st June1893 (Enclosure 2 in the circular despatch above referred to). I am therefore directed to inform you that His Majesty’s Government consider that the same measure of protection may properly be extended , to British-protected persons abroad as to British subjects, except in so far as the right or power to exercise such protection depends upon a treaty, agreement, or statutory enactment, which excludes, or cannot be construed as including such “ protected persons.” When the whole control of the foreign relations of a state lias been assumed by His Majesty’s Government, it is apparent that the duty of protecting the natives or subjects of that State in other countries must also be assumed. What measure of protection can be given must depend upon the extent of the jurisdiction enjoyed by His Majesty’s Government in the country where the protection is desired. It is only where that jurisdiction is confined to those who are, in the strict technical sense of our municipal law, British subjects, that it cannot be exercised in respect of protected persons.
