Political Agent, Bahrain.D.Q.No: /3 ^T Po 1 i t i cal iig© ncy, Bahrain,the 7th December 1931* Dear Colonel, A little w||ile ago I noticed that v/hen repatriating a slave to Muscat,in addition to the is. 13/- fare,r/e were obliged to pay Is.5/- quarantine fee. I wrote to Major Fowle and pointed out that since Bahrain was,and had been free from infection for a very long time, the re appeared no justification for levying a quarantine fee against useand enquired what machinery was in existence for refunding it. le replied that the Is.5/- is collecten for the upkeep of the ua ran tine Station and the whole of the )uarantine establishment,and the fee,which is collected by Mespers, is never refunded, I don ? t know whether the Residency was consulted when Hedgoock instituted this tax,but,I think you will agree, that we are amassing the burdens which are placed on the very- poor deck passen.^rs who travel in the Gulf* The steamer fares have already been enhanced considerably and in addition to that they have to go to the expense of providing’ themselvee with nationality papers,which,even in the case of Certificates of Identity,form a serious item to a man living so near the starvation line as the average diver. Now in addition to this Muscat levy this very heavy charge of Ks.5/- for a service which is negiigible,since they are already bound to support an Agency Burgeon,or rather we are,and a very small fee would recompense him for going a hundred 3 rards to occasional steamers. If anyone were to charge me two or three hundred rupees for a quarantine fee I should be justifiably annoyed but that is what it represents proportionately to the average diver. Avevy considerable nuraber of these people return eveiy year frora Bahrain to Muscat after the diving und if only those who have to go by steamer pay this fee,it will hit the 3.1 as those who cannot afford to pay it will go by dhow. If Muscat continue this charge,Bahrain will be quite justified in instituting it and would require very little inducement to do so and then another burden will be placed on these unfortunate deck passengers* I m addressing fehis to you instead of Bradshaw in case you care to discuss the matter with Major Bowie. If the unseat State urgently require extra funds,surely the burden ought to fall on the broadest backs? The Ilonjble Lt Gol.E.V.Biscoe,I.A .0^1 't 4- 4 1 — x * J_ v .

Adviser to the Bahrein Government now states that the restrictions against landing in Bahrein apply to passengers arriving by steamers from Basrah only. Passengers from other Northern Ports travelling either by steamers or native craft are not included in the limits of the embargo M . It would appear that the facts mentioned in this memorandum are not quite correct as quarantine is imposed against all Second &amp; Third Class passengers arriving here by our Company’s Vessels from north of Bahrein.

A set ; of Picture and Letter Posters, Magic Lantern Slides, Models and Cinema Films mentioned in the list are kept ready for the use of mofussil committees for Baby and Health Week celebrations. Each set of cinema films contains some films on (1) Maternity and Baby Care, (2) Preventable diseases and (3) Entertainment topic. Posters include those secured from various sources in India and abroad and they are not available for sale. 2. If intimation of a proposed Baby and Health Week or Health Exhibition is given about two months in advance by any mofussil committee, in the British Territory. Bombay Presidency, it is frequently possible to guarantee the despatch of one complete set together with our Standard Cinema Machine with Transformer or Electric Generator in charge of our operator for the celebration free of hire charge See paras 3 &amp; 4 below for transportation and damage charges. In the case of Indian States and centers outside this Presidency a small loan charge will be made, for which see para 5. The Committee will have to ■ spend for petrol and kerosene which is required for the electric generator. If electric current (Voltage 230) is available, there is no neeed to send our Elecric Generator as our Standard Cinema Machine is fully equipped with resistence and special cinema lamp for use with direct current. 3. The mofussil committee will have to bear the transporta tion charge for our material and the travelling expense of the cinema operator. They will have to arrange for the lodging and boarding of the operator during his stay there. The local commi ttees are advised to arrange privately for the BOARDING and LODGING of the men sent by the Association but if private boarding arrangements are not possible the committee will have to pay their boarding charges which may vary from Re. 1/—to Rs. 1-8-0 per day according to local conditions. These are about the only expenses they will have to bear for securing the material from the Association. If they want to purchase any of the healthliterature shown in the list they should submit an * indent for the same together with an advance of at least half of the price of the material ordered. The Railway Companies will give concession for the exhibits, cinema machine, electric generator, etc., of the Associa tion, in case the same are sent to a place for the celebration of Jlaby and.Health Weeks or for Educational Propaganda in Health and Child Welfare during Fairs, Melas, Conferences, etc. We wiU ^end the form of certificate together with a risk note form for the use of local secretary. On the onward journey from Bombay the mateiial will be booked at full parcel rate and for the return jjourney free of charge if the local secretary will properly fill up | the certificate and forward it to the local Station Master. 4. Mofussil Committees should please note that in as much as all our exhibits ( models, lantern slides, cinema films, etc. .are being sent to them free of loan charge, a moderate bill to cover the damage, if any, to the exhibits will be made when our mechanic will inspect them after their return from their place. By damage we do not mean 01 dinary wear and tear but it is .found exhibits sometimes get very much damaged or even broken altogether if sufficient care is not taken by the local committees to protect them from rain or from the on-rush of visitors to the exhibition, or from thieves, cattle, etc., if the exhibits are kept in the open at night. A bill will be made to cover such damages. 5. Centres in Indian States and in British Territory outside Bombay Presidency, will be supplied with a complete set of exhibits and cinema outfit in charge of our operator provided (1) we receive their application sufficiently early, (2) they are ready to bear the transport and the travelling expenses of our material and men and hire charge for material indented and (3) there are no mofussil centres in British Territory Bombay Presidency, to whom the exhibits and men are already booked for that period. Pull information regarding the loan charges* etc. is given in the Circular letter to centres in Indian States and those outside Bombay Presidency. It can be had on application to the Honorary Provincial Secretaries. G. K. Devadhae, H. V. Tilak. Honorary Provincial Secretaries. %Price • No. Item. Per Per Language. Copy 100 Pamphlets. 1.
