You will remember it was about the wireless enthusiast in Bahrein who v/ants an amateur transmitting licence. I do not think it is necessary for this to come to the I.C.C. and I have had a word with the Admiralty about it and they now concur. I think, therefore, you should proceed as suggested in the last sentence of your letter. Yours sincerely, J.P.Gibson, Esq., India Office. *mmmmm mmmm ■ncnn mm m. AIR MINISTRY, ADASTRAL HOUSE. KINGSWAY. SN.C.Z. //November, 1937, In reply to your P.Z.6875/37 of the 26th October, I have made enquiries in the appropriate branches here and they see no objection to the installation of an amateur W/T transmitter station at Bahrein, provided that any aerials, etc,, in no way interfere with flying facilities in that island. 702212/37 A very large nuraber of transmitting licences have been issued to amateurs all over the world. Presumably Mr. Brown would have to obtain a licence from the G.P.O. India whose regulations are, I believe, based on similar regulations applied by the G.P.O. at home. It is understood that these regulations provide for the withdrawal of licences and the closing down of any transmitting station in the event of emergency or war. In addition we think that clauses should be inserted in the licence providing for (a) the closing of the station at any time on request by the British Political authority in Bahrein should they consider such a course desirable , and (b) to ensure that there is no interference with local R.A.F. and civil v;/T facilities. It seems hardly necessary, therefore, to bring so small a matter to the attention of the Imperial Communications Committee, but if you have any further doubts regarding this proposal it may be as well to refei the question officially. / S7 ftz«, Lifts h Sia£.

Brown in Bahrain, provided the licence were issued on the lines of amateur transmitting licences in the United Kingdom. We suggest, however, that it would be advisable for the question to be considered by the Imperial Communications Committee, and I presume you will take the necessary steps to bring the matter before this Committee, if you concur in the suggestion.

In this, the Fifth Edition of A Guide to Amateur Radio, an endeavour has been made to place before readers a comprehensive and up-to-date account of radio theory and practice as applied in particular to the experimental viewpoint. The need to record the achievements of the pioneers of Amateur Radio seems desirable when memories tend to become short-lived and development strides on, hence the Introductory Chapter which outlines briefly certain historical and ethical aspects of the movement. The technical chapters, written in clear and concise language, should enable the reader with but an elementary knowledge of electrical matters to grasp the principles governing the operation of valves and valve circuits. Chapters dealing with Ultra-high Frequency Apparatus and Television have been included for the first time, wEilst the subject-matter contained in other chapters has been thoroughly revised and numerous new diagrams added. It is hoped that the methods of treatment adopted by the author of the Television Chapter (a Founder and Council Member of The Television Society) will be appreciated. No attempt has been made to deal at length with earlier Television systems, but the interested reader may obtain the necessary information by referring to books mentioned in the chapter entitled “ Selected References.” The chapters dealing with Transmitters, Receivers, Aerials and Valves have been extensively rewritten in order to bring the material up to date. The later chapters deal with such general subjects as the Morse Code, Useful Formulae, and International Prefixes, w’hilst details are also given of the methods of obtaining Artificial and Full Radiating Aerial Licences. As in past years the production of this Edition has only been made possible by the whole-hearted co-operation of a group of prominent members of the Radio Society of Great Britain. In this connection we record our grateful thanks to Messrs. H. A. M. Clark, B.Sc. (Eng.), A.M.I.E.E. (G60r); D. N. Corfield, D.L.C. Hons., Grad.I.E.E. (G5CD) ; E. L. Gardiner, B.Sc. (G6GR) ; F.

(BRS.648). ‘ We also acknowledge the original work contributed in earlier editions, and in particular that prepared by Mr. T. P. Allen, M.Sc., A.M.I.E.E. (GI6YW), much of which has been amplified by present contributors. Thanks are also accorded to all advertisers who by their generous support have enabled the publishers to again offer this wealth of information at a low price. By supporting advertisers readers will be rendering a service to the cause of Amateur Radio. J. c. B2 34 CHAPTER ONE Amateur Radio An Introduction A GREAT many people into whose hands this book falls will get from it their first contact with what is known as Amateur Radio—a scientific hobby which is one of the most interesting and progressive in this age of science. For others, who may already have some idea of the meaning of Amateur Radio, it is hoped that this introduction will serve to deepen their knowledge and under standing, at the same time perhaps correcting those erroneous impressions which are so easily formed merely by what one hears. So far as it is possible to compress within these pages the years of work culminating in modern technical practice in the branch of the radio art which we are discussing, it has been done in the succeeding chapters, and it is therefore no part of this introduction to deal with technique, but rather with the aims, objects, principles and traditions of Amateur Radio as a hobby. The first explanation must therefore be a definition of Amateur Radio—what is it ? In the fewest possible words, it is an interest in radio carried to the point where one is able to sit down at one’s own apparatus and communicate with similar amateur stations scattered all over the world. Amateur Radio, sometimes incorrectly called “ amateur broadcasting,” has therefore nothing whatever to do with broadcasting in the accepted sense—apart from the fact that the ether is the medium used for all radio purposes—since a transmission made by an amateur is intended, in the vast majority of cases, only for the station to which it is addressed. Moreover, as is well known and will be clearly brought out in the following pages, the frequencies (wavelengths) set aside for amateur use fall in the short-wave band, and it is by accident rather than design that the ordinary commercial receiver brings in amateur stations. To say that broadcasting is now a common place is a clichS, but it is nevertheless only during the last few years that it has become an indispen sable institution. It is therefore not surprising that many people regard Amateur Radio as the offspring of broadcasting; a natural development, due to amateur interest in the technical side of radio engendered by broadcasting itself. From this, it is easy to understand why Amateur Radio is often thought of as the youngest and least developed of the scientific pursuits. Actually, however, the very reverse of all this is the case. Not only broadcasting, but also the fundamental technique of practically all forms of wireless communication is chiefly due to the pioneer work of men who were amateurs in every sense of that much abused and overworked word. From the very early days, the progress of radio has been largely sustained by amateurs. Before the Great War, when the parent of this Society was formed—the Wireless Society of London— knowledge was scanty and apparatus almost unobtainable, but devoted enthusiasts struggled with their experiments, and communication over twenty miles or so was hailed as no mean achieve ment. Commercial radio was almost entirely confined to ship-shore working, though a few Government and service stations were also in existence. In August, 1914, pre-war Amateur Radio activities were brought to an abrupt con clusion, and in the ranks of the fighting forces the amateurs of that day turned their specialised knowledge and ability to good account. After the War, and the inevitable struggle with officialdom to get the ban on private experimental stations lifted, came a period of tremendous expansion in the world of radio. Much research had been carried out during the four years 1914-18, and as this information became available, amateurs once more began to play their part in the work which has led to the results of the present day. The earliest broadcasting station in this country, at Writtle (' Two Emma Toe ”) was built and staffed by engineers who had gained most of their experience as amateurs. The establishment of broadcasting as a national undertaking was the direct result of the pioneer effort at Writtle, and once again professional engineers were recruited from the amateur ranks. It is noteworthy that the technical work of the B.B.C. is still largely in the hands of these erstwhile ‘‘ amateurs.” But what is probably the most romantic and fascinating of all is the story of short-wave radio, of which so much is heard to-day, when a listener with his “ all-wave set ” beside him can tune in programmes literally from the ends of the earth. The intense research work and engineering effort making this possible has been crammed into less than ten years, and is the result of what can only be described as an accident. It happened like this. With the establishment of broadcasting, amateur transmitting stations were no longer wanted—or so it was supposed—• and the licence conditions were revised to confine their experiments to the wavelengths below broad casting ; that is, from 200 metres down. Various eminent mathematicians had asserted that these short waves were useless, just as they had done for the long waves when Marconi first started hisA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 5 Transatlantic tests, and it was thought that the -^mateurs would be safely out of the way and could - do no harm. Before long, however, the critics were again confounded, and amazing records were being set up by low-power stations using, in most cases, less energy than the domestic electric lamp. In fact, to the astonishment of the technical world, it was found that direct communication with the Antipodes was quite easy on these short waves, which had hitherto been considered useless. Once more history was repeated. The commercial interests hastened to stake their claims, for obviously it was going to be much cheaper to operate long distance services on these new frequencies than through expensive high-power long-wave stations with a comparatively limited range. The great research laboratories turned their attention seriously to radio, calling on the amateurs for staff. Short wave broadcasting was established, and gradually what had been a barren desert in the radio sense became populated with important stations and services. As will be remembered by many, it looked for a time as if this country was going to be left behind in the development of international broadcasting by short-wave radio, till an amateur transmitter in Surrey, who recently passed through the presidential chair of this Society and is still an active member, obtained a special licence and carried out tests on his own initiative for over a year. The results he obtained form the basis of our present and projected Empire broadcasting system. The amateurs, who had made all this development possible by their collective efforts, were in danger of being squeezed out again, just as they had been from the broadcast band. But by now their worth had been recognised by the more influential Govern ments. An international agreement was drawn up in 1927 which, while regulating and sharing out among the various claimants the new range of wavelengths available, secured for the amateur also his right to a share of the ether. With modifica tions, this agreement still stands, and to-day there are private stations all over the world in daily contact with one another, still pursuing the never ceasing search for further improvement. Since the early days, the scope for amateur research has naturally been getting progressively less, but Amateur Radio as a hobby has grown considerably, and there are now about 60,000 stations in the world, internationally organised. Each country has its own representative body— such as the Radio Society of Great Britain and the American Radio Relay League—and all these societies act together through the International Amateur Radio Union. This is not only a constantly active force doing its not inconsiderable share towards world unity and understanding, but is also a very necessary arrangement in the strictly business sense, as the commercial interests are still hungry for the modest space in the ether allowed the amateur. The British Government, realising the potential value of the amateur operators in time of war or other emergency, has established a reserve recruited entirely from the amateur ranks. The Royal Naval Wireless Auxiliary Reserve is not the least enthu siastic of our “ territorial ” organisations, consisting as it does of capable young men whose interest-in an absorbing hobby maintains their keenness and efficiency. The present trend in radio development is to go lower and yet lower in wavelength, as illustrated by the B.B.C. television transmissions on 7 metres. This wavelength was chosen on account of technical necessity, as one of the theoretical drawbacks is the limited service area, which has been shown mathematically not to exceed visual range. Hence, as everyone knows, the decision to transmit from Alexandra Palace and the erection of a high mast to improve range in the optical sense. Apart from the fact that totally unexpected distances are regularly being covered by this comparatively high-power transmitter, it is worth noting that during the last few months amateurs on five metres have obtained two-way communication well outside optical range with much lower power, while confirmation of Transatlantic reception has also been received. It looks as if history is going to repeat itself yet again. * * * * * It will now be evident that Amateur Radio—- represented in this country by the Radio Society of Great Britain, one of the oldest organisations of its kind in the world—-has behind it a tremendous record of service and achievement, while in the course of the years have grown up its associated traditions. Though we who are now its practitioners rightly regard Amateur Radio primarily as a hobby—-since the exploitation of broadcasting and communications has long since passed into the hands of commercial concerns—the main interests of the more technically- minded members of this Society are still in the direction of discovery and improvement, though, as has been said earlier, the opportunities are not as great as they used to be ; for radio, having become commercialised to the fullest extent possible con sistent with present developments, now offers a very lucrative field for professional research, with which the amateur can scarely hope to compete. During the last few years, therefore, Amateur Radio has tended to develop along its own lines, such as the production of better apparatus, main tenance of more consistent communication, preparation for emergency work, improvement of station efficiency, and so on, all this being carried out on the amateur frequency-bands which have now been in use for some time. In other words, Amateur Radio has become the hobby it now is, open to anyone sufficiently interested to attain the standard of knowledge required to qualify for an amateur transmitting licence. As might be imagined, however, there is a little more in it than just that. Apart from what has to be learnt—which comes surprisingly easily to those who have had any sort of scientific training or experience, as it does to the beginner graduating from “ wireless ” as a hobby—it is necessary that the would-be amateur should start with the know ledge that the success of Amateur Radio depends on co-operation. It was co-operation which made progress possible thirty years ago, and it is still as necessary to-day, even if only for a successful contact with another station. On this ever-present necessity for co-operation is largely based the tradition of Amateur Radio, of which much could be said, for it probably has no parallel in any other human activity. This tradition, contained in what is termed simply the “ Ham Spirit '—“ ham ” being an abbreviation of “ amateur ”—is that feeling of camaraderie and6 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO good-fellowship which is common to amateurs the world over. For the game of Amateur Radio is followed by people of both sexes and of all ages, colours and creeds, and it is not confined to any one class or section of these communities. At any gathering of this Society, for instance, members meet on common ground—their interest in Amateur Radio. Whatever they are outside, and it may be literally anything from the proverbial dustman to the unlikely millionaire, in the meeting they are amateurs and it is the Ham Spirit which binds them together. Money, on which most of us base our hopes and fears in everyday life, is of very secondary importance, for a man is not judged by the equip ment he can purchase but by the signal he radiates. And some of our leading members use entirely home-built apparatus costing no more than a few pounds. In other words, a good amateur is the man who makes the most of his opportunities, whatever they may be. If he can use all the best and latest apparatus, so much the better ; but that in itself does not make him a better amateur than the youngster struggling to get a signal out of a thirty- foot back-garden. A 56 Me Rotating Beam Aerial. The tradition of Amateur Radio is therefore very valuable and much cherished, and though it has never been formulated in so many words—all the best laws are the unwritten ones on which our codes of morals and conduct are based—-it means in effect that there is among amateurs a tacit understanding that they help one another in every way possible within the framew'ork of Amateur Radio ; that any member of this Society can count on the free and ready assistance of any other member with whom he may come in contact, personally or otherwise. Nor is this confined only to this country ; it applies with equal force the world over. Our members who have visited other countries know how much it means if they are able to get into personal touch with foreign amateurs, and the Ham Spirit is never so much in ^ evidence as when an English amateur goes abroad. With all this has grown up the language of Amateur Radio—that curious form of abbreviated English which every amateur must know, and which enables a Hindu to communicate with a Greek, even though neither of them can speak any other tongue but his own. This international language, carried out in the morse code, is easily learnt “ on the air ” by any aspiring amateur and, together with the Q code, is probably the nearest approach to a really universal language yet devised, if the fact that it is accepted in every country of the world counts for anything. It is impossible in this short chapter to cover all of what might be called the human side of Amateur Radio, just as this book can only hope to present a brief outline of all the multifarious branches of its technique, but this introduction would not be complete without some further reference to the Radio Society of Great Britain, which serves not only as the representative body but also as the guiding influence and focus of British amateur activities. While membership is open to anyone sufficiently interested to join, and carries with it a number of privileges and advantages, the Society like all others, however well established they may be—can only exist on the progress made by, and the support of, its members. This means that a lot depends on the individual member—his interest in and his acceptance of the traditions of Amateur Radio, and the understanding that by joining he is going to do his share not only in maintaining the traditions, but by himself making progress, con tributing a little something to the sum total of our knowledge and experience, by which Amateur Radio lives. The prospective member may have had Amateur Radio presented to him in other ways and from other sources, for, human nature being what it is, Amateur Radio is itself now at the point where it could very easily become commercialised. That this degree of progress has been possible is, in this country, solely due to the achievements of this Society in bringing the game to that stage where it is a scientific hobby no longer confined to a few, but open to all. Many harsh things have been said and unfair conclusions drawn from what can sometimes be heard “ on the air.” Certain organs of the bookstall radio press have not been slow to seize upon those less worthy and worth-while aspects of Amateur Radio—but which yet have a circulation and advertisement value— to present it in a way which, while it may be amusing to that mysterious entity, the-man-in-the- street, is far removed from the practice and principles of Amateur Radio as it really is. It can therefore be said without fear of contradiction that it is only by having access to the various publications of this Society that aspiring amateurs can hope to obtain authoritative information and guidance along the right lines. And so we leave you to study the rest of this “Guide to Amateur Radio.” Whether you are interested or whether you are not, if you join or if you do not, the next time you see a tall mast and a lighted window late at night, think of Amateur Radio, and remember how one of the most amazing sciences of this age has put the world at the finger tips of the Amateur Radio Operator. \ » f • cCHAPTER TWO F imdamentals Ohm’s Law—Tuned Circuits—Propagation—Skip Effect Efficiency——Receivers T HE primary purpose of this chapter is to describe in simple language some of the fundamental principles involved in the study of high frequency alternating currents. The amateur experimenter will, however, be well advised to increase his knowledge of these principles by studying the more comprehensive publications which are enumerated in another page. Besides possessing a general, if only elementary, knowledge of high frequency engineering, the reader must understand circuit theory if he is to appreciate to the full the operation of the radio apparatus he will construct and operate. This does not mean that a radio experimenter must be a scientific “ highbrow” ; the majority of amateurs are men of very ordinary technical attainments, and thousands have never received a technical training of any sort. Interest and keenness are the only necessities for the beginner; technical knowledge is bound to follow, especially if the reader becomes associated with other amateurs, as he will do if he joins the Radio Society of Great Britain. In this chapter an attempt has been made to give the beginner some idea of ” how and why the wheels go round.” We can very briefly sum up the task which a radio amateur has to perform—if he possesses a trans mitting station he must be able to radiate electrical energy in a useful manner to a distant listener, and he must be able to receive efficiently the energy that a distant transmitting station sends to him„ If, as will be the case with many new readers, reception only is to be considered, their task will be to receive efficiently signals radiated by their transmitting colleagues. The Electron Radiation, without which there could be neither transmission nor reception, is a direct result of the behaviour of the electron, and in this short sum mary it would seem a good idea to get down to the elemental facts. The electron is the smallest possible quantity of negative electricity and, with its counterpart the proton, is the basis of all matter. It is difficult to imagine that the difference between a piece of coal and a piece of copper is merely one of arrange ment and number of electrons; nevertheless it is so, and everything we know as matter is composed of countless electrons and protons. An Electric Current Electricity is not ” generated ” by a battery or dynamo any more than water is generated by a water pump. Batteries, dynamos and the like, generate a stress tending to cause the electrons in a body to move in some particular way, just as a pump generates pressure or ” head ” and tends to cause the water to flow if we provide a path for it. If we provide a path or “ circuit ” for the electron motion we obtain an electric current; a current is, in short, a drift of electrons in some direction. D.C. If the drift is maintained in one direction we call the current ” direct ” or “ continuous ” ; a centrifugal pump would produce this effect in a closed system of water pipes. A.C. Suppose we stress the circuit in alternate direc tions, then the drift of electrons will reverse periodically, and this is called an ' alternating ” current; a reciprocating pump in a closed system of water pipes would be something similar. Alternating current is now widely used to transmit energy for domestic and commercial use, and the standard rapidity of reversals, or ' frequency,” in Great Britain is 50 per second. The currents used in telephone work have various frequencies corresponding to the pitch of the sound, and these range from about 40 per second to about 8,000 per second. Such frequencies are known as “audio-frequencies,” or 'low-frequencies.” Ampli fier valves following the detector handle frequencies of this order. Alternating currents of greater than 10,000 cycles per second are known as “ radio-frequencies.” and as such may be as high as 300,000,000 cycles per second, or even higher. When speaking of such large numbers it is more convenient to speak of the “ thousands ” of cycles per second ; the frequencies above would be therefore 10 kilocycles per second (kc) and 300,000 kc. Even the latter is large, and when dealing with the very high frequencies we often speak of “ megacycles ” or million cycles per second ; e.g., the above would be 300 Me. The Circuit The amount of stress generated by any source is called the ' Electro-motive-force ” (E.M.F.) and is8 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO measured in volts; the E.M.F. generated by a single cell of a dry battery is about volts. Naturally the greater the E.M.F. applied to a given circuit the higher will be the current, which is measured in amperes. For any electric circuit the current which will be set up by a given E.M.F. will be found from the relation :— „ . E.M.F. (in volts) Current (in amperes) = Ohm’s Law The law governing direct current circuits is known as Ohm’s Law, and from the formula given above it will be seen that providing w’e know the value of two factors, we can obtain the third. We can express Ohm’s Law in the following manner :— E = lx R where I = Current in amperes, R = Resistance in ohms and E = E.M.F. in volts. R = Rj + R 2 R 3 + R 4 ' + R 6 Fig. 1 shows diagrammatically the three conditions described. Rl R2 R3 -AAAA/ —ww—vwv— Fig. 1. Resistance The opposition to a direct current will be due to the size and material of the conductors, and this is called the resistance of the circuit. The resistance of a conductor may be found from the following formula, where L and A must be in the same units, i.e., either centimetres or inches. The constant p depends on the material, and is known as the “ specific resistance ” ; values for various materials may be obtained from any good electrical handbook. Resistance (ohms) = p^- L = length of conductor ; A = cross-sectional area. Resistances in Series When resistances are connected together in a circuit so that the same current flows through one after the other, their values are added together to obtain the total resistance they offer in the circuit. Thus :— R = Rj-}-R 2 -|-Rs - )-R4+ .... etc. where R=the total resistance and R t R 2 etc., are the individual resistances. Resistances in Parallel When resistances are connected so that they offer alternative paths for the circuit current, e.g., the filaments in a battery receiver, the formula for finding the total resistance is :— R = —+ —+ Ri Ra 1 j~+ etc. As there are alternative paths for the current it will be obvious that the total resistance is reduced, and will be less than the lowest resistance in use. Resistances in Series-Parallel Frequently in radio circuits resistances are arranged in series-parallel. The formula for finding the total resistance for such a circuit is Power and Heating Effects In all electrical circuits heat is generated in the wire or components carrying the current. The power used in heating or the heat dissipated can be found from the formula Power (watts) = E X I By substitution we can also state that ; W = I 2 x R.orW = JK where E = E.M.F. in volts, R = Resistance in ohms and I = Current in amperes. If -we require to know the input power to the last valve in a transmitter, w r e multiply the volts applied to the anode of the valve by the current passing through the valve, e.g., if a transmitter is operated at 500 volts and the current .passing is 50 mA the power input is 500 X -05 = 25 watts. Eddy Current Losses Every electrical current has associated with it a magnetic field. If the current is alternating then the field also alternates, conversely alternating magnetic fields can induce alternating currents in any conductor they traverse. Thus an alternating current in one circuit can induce current in adjacent circuits by its magnetic effect. In some cases we deliberately transfer energy in this way; often however, such induced currents cause undesirable loss. It is therefore necessary to be cautious particularly in high frequency circuits to see that no large metal objects are close to the coils or circuits carrying large current. Skin Effect Such an effect occurs at high frequency in the actual wire down which the original current flows. The effect is to induce an opposition current in the conductor which effectively increases its resistance—HMMBMBMaMMnNPMnMRVWWM A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 9 The material of a conductor will thus produce the same resistance for direct current or for alternating currents of low frequency, but as the frequency is increased the current tends to travel only on the surface of the conductor, and this effect is very pronounced at radio-frequencies. As the whole section of the conductor is not utilised the resistance is increased. When the conductor is in the form of a coil the current distribution on the surface of the conductor is not uniform because of the effect of current in neighbouring turns. At radio-frequencies we find conductors of large surface area and, very often, copper tubing instead of solid conductor. Reactance An alternating current has, in addition, two other types of opposition, viz., that due to a condenser and that due to an inductance. These additional oppositions are known as reactances and differ from resistance in that they do not dissipate energy. But as they are similar to resistance in that they limit the current they are measured in “ apparent ohms.” The values of both kinds of reactance depend on the frequency of the current ; the reactance of a condenser (X ) can be calculated from the formula x c X = — ohms 47C J where / is the frequency, C the capacitance in farads and = 3 14. The reactance of an inductance is given by Xi, = 2:r / L ohms where L is the inductance in henrys. Impedance When a circuit contains reactance and resistance in series, the simple addition of the oppositions does not give the total opposition of the circuit ; to obtain this total opposition, which is a mixture of resistance and reactance, the following formula must be used :— z„ yW+ This quantity is called the ' impedance ” of the circuit. Resonance It will be noticed that the capacitative reactance and the inductive reactance subtract, i.e., their oppositions are of different types and the result of putting a capacitance in series with an inductance is to reduce the inductance effect. When their values are equal the resultant reactance of the circuit is zero. It will be noticed that under these conditions the impedance of the circuit reduces to its resistance. As the current in a circuit depends on the impedance, the current in a circuit containing capacitance and inductance will be a maximum when the reactance is zero. Therefore for maximum current we write, 6 28/C = 6 ‘ 28 / L There are three variables here, two of which are usually fixed by conditions. If L and C are fixed we get the frequency for maximum current in the shape:— 1 - 6-28 VTCT This is the frequency of tune of a circuit containing an inductance L and a capacitance C. Tuning Direct currents are not affected by reactance except in the case of switching on or switching off ; these transient conditions may well be left until the reader has a more thorough grasp of the fundamentals. Working with a fixed value of inductance L and varying the value of the capacitance C we may alter the tune of the circuit to get any value of frequency; this is the case in receivers and transmitters where the variable element is usually the capacitance, for practical reasons. Parallel circuits carrying alternating currents are a little more difficult and the reader is referred to the many excellent text-books on the subject if occasion should arise for such calculations. Fig. 2 shows how the current will vary in a tuned circuit as the value of capacitance is changed ; it will be seen that the current rises to its maximum Fig, 2. at a value C R . This value of capacitance is such that, at the particular frequency applied to the circuit, the total reactance of the circuit becomes zero. The formula given for the frequency of resonance of a series circuit is true also for a parallel tuned circuit, and we meet parallel circuits more often than series circuits. Let us consider them separately: Fig. 3 shows a series circuit, the resistance R being mainly the resistance of the wire in the inductance coils. Inspection of the formula for the resonant frequency shows that we may employ a small C and a big L, or vice-versa, but the product LC must be a certain value for a given frequency. In other words, we may employ any ratio of induc tance to capacity so long as their product is constant. What will be the practical effect of changing the L/C ratio ? Fig. 3. In the series circuit the reactance is zero and the impedance equal to R (this is true at resonant frequency only), no matter what value the L/C ratio, but the higher we make the ratio the greater will be the alternating voltage across either the condenser or the inductance. In short, altering the L/C ratio will not affect the current through10 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO the circuit, except in so far as the resistance will be increased by a bigger coil, but the voltage across the L and C will be varied. Fig. 4 shows the parallel circuit. Again it will be seen that we may employ any L/C ratio as long as their product is of the correct value for the frequency. In this case the value we choose for 1- A ~ Fig. 4. L/C is of great importance. The opposition (“ impedance ”) that such a circuit offers to an alternating voltage applied to the ends A-B is found from the expression L/CB, when the frequency of the applied voltage is the same as the resonant frequency. Obviously the higher we make the L/C ratio, the more opposition the tuned circuit offers to the current, and therefore the smaller will be the current. The parallel circuit at its resonant Irequency behaves like a resistance of value L/CK. and this value is often called the *' dynamic resistance ” of the circuit. The resonant frequency of the circuit is slightly affected by its resistance, but this may be neglected in practical work. The result of using a high L/C ratio in a parallel circuit then, is to offer the source a high opposition, and reduce the current in the circuit. The considerations governing a suitable choice of L/C ratio will be dealt with later when circuits are being treated. “ Q ” A term which expresses in a simple way the ' goodness ” of a circuit is coming into general use. It is ' Q,” which is coil reactance/resistance. This is really the Q of the coil, but in practice the circuit resistance is mainly located in the coil. As reactance depends on frequency, the frequency at which Q is calculated should be stated, but as resistance will vary with frequency also, the Q may be assumed to be constant in the neighbourhood of the stated frequency. Obviously, we want a coil to be a reactance and not a resistance ; Q shows how well we have achieved this. Radiation Let us return to the little electron, and see how it produces radiation of wireless waves. When an electron is accelerated some energy is radiated from the circuit in the form of electio- magnetic waves. The steady drift in a direct current circuit represents no acceleration except when the drift is started or stopped, and it is therefore at these instants only that there is any radiation of energy. But the electrons in an A.C. circuit are being started, stopped, started in a reverse direction, and so on, continuously. Such a circuit will steadily radiate energy. The energy radiated at the commercial frequency of 50 cycles per second is infinitesimal, but as the frequency gets higher the amount of energy radiated in the form of electro-magnetic waves (“ wireless ' waves) is increased. These waves travel out at the immense speed of light, viz., 300,000,000 metres per second. Wavelength If the current in a circuit has a frequency of f ” it will be clear that we radiate f waves per second. So that, at the end of a second, the f th wave is just leaving and the first one is 300,000,000 metres away. We have f waves stretching out over 300,000,000 metres, so each must be 300,000,000 -j- f metres long; this is the wavelength. The wavelength is the distance travelled during one cycle. It will be noticed that the very shortest waves will be generated when we cause the current to reverse an immense number of times per second— a “ high ” frequency. This is also the condition for greatest radiation for, as mentioned before, the energy radiated increases with frequency. Short waves provide us with the best radiation and, fortunately, all amateur work is done on short wavelengths. The only useful part of the energy is, of course, that which arrives at the receiver, wherever that may be. In commeicial point-to-point communi cation the position of the receiver is known and the energy can be concentrated in a beam in that direction. Amadeur transmitters will be in com munication with others in many places, and beam work is not possible save for exceptional experimental work. Standing Waves and Travelling Waves When radiation is required it is necessary to set up “ standing waves.” and where high-frequency power is to be transmitted from one place to another (c.g., from the transmitter to the radiating system) without radiation, “ travelling” waves are necessary. In an ordinary low-frequency lighting or power circuit the variations are caused by ” travelling ” waves, and ammeters connected at different points to read the circuit current will all show the same value. This is because the length of the circuit is small compared with the wavelength ; 50 c/s represents a wavelength of about 3,726 miles. We have, in telephone work, circuits carrying alternating currents of speech frequencies, and the wavelength of 1,000 c/s is only about 186 miles— which is quite of the same order of length as many telephone lines. A more detailed account of this subject will be given in the chapter dealing with aerial systems. Propagation In the early days of wireless it was considered that long waves gave the best results, and that the strength of signal received depended on the distance between transmitter and receiver, the most distant instrument, of course, receiving least. Waves less than about 200 metres long were found to be rapidly attenuated in passing over the earth by causing currents in buildings, trees, hills, etc., which were too small to affect the longer waves. With the development of more sensitive receiving devices it was found, however, that this picture isA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 11 not true, but that short-wave signals could avoid earth-bound obstacles and travel around the earth in a number of “ hops.” The attenuation of a wave 20 metres long (frequency 15 million c.p.s.), is so great that its ” ground wave ” can only be heard for about 20 or 30 miles. \\ hen Marconi first transmitted radio signals across the Atlantic Ocean in 1901, a great controversy arose as to how the signals could follow the curvature of the earth. It was known that even the long waves would not go far through the earth, and it was soon shown that the ” dragging ” effect of the ground on the bottom of the wave-front would not give it enough curvature. Finally a theory was developed both by Heaviside in England and by Kenelly in the U.S.A. that the earth is encased in a conducting atmospheric shell which acts as a reflector and so forces the waves round its curved surface. Subsequent studies have shown that this theory is correct. Explorations of the atmosphere by physicists using radio and other means have given us an idea of its constitution and have opened up a great new branch of science, of interest to the meteorologist as well as the radio upwards. These ionised regions are not sharply defined, but vary in intensity from height to height, being most highly ionised in the layers named. The whole of the atmosphere above about 60 miles high is ionised to some extent, and is known as the “ ionosphere.” The ionosphere owes its electrical properties to energy radiated in various forms from the sun, and it is natural therefore that the layers will vary according to the energy received. During the night, for instance, when the source is absent, the ions or electrically charged atoms will tend to recombine with the free electrons, forming neutral atoms, and the conductivity of the ionosphere will decrease. For our radio waves the effective height of the layers will increase, and they may lose their reflective power altogether, making short-wave com munication impossible. In addition to the daily cycle, there is also a seasonal variation according to the amount of light received. A third variation is provided by the sun itself, which suffers internal disturbances of a very complex nature causing its radiated energy to vary month by month and year by year. Serious Fig. 5. man. Our present knowledge involves two electrically conducting layers of prime importance in wireless communication, and as the studies progress, more and more layers of secondary importance are revealed. We shall consider here only that major pair, for in terms of these a simple explanation can be given of how long and short wave signals can curve or ” hop ” round the earth. The energy radiated upwards at a small angle to the horizontal rapidly gets clear of the surroundings of the transmitter and travels upwards. As it gets higher and higher it finds the air becoming more ionis3d, i.e., more conducting. This eventually causes the wave to be turned down again, rather in the way a beam of light is reflected from a bright surface. We may consider the waves are reflected from the conducting layers situated at a considerable height above the earth’s surface. The first of these to be discovered, the Heaviside layer, has a height of about 60 miles. The other important layer is known as the Appleton layer and this exists from about 140 miles disturbances are made manifest by the appearance of visible markings on the sun, called sunspots, and often on these occasions the ionosphere is so affected as to cause sudden and profound changes in the propagation of waves, usually for the worse. With all these changes taking place we find that the daily, seasonal, and yearly alterations in short wave propagation, make an extremely interesting study for transmitting amateurs, and although present knowledge is well advanced there is here a great field of work in which the amateur can take part. Different frequencies penetrate the layers to different depths before they are bent back, the higher frequencies penetrating more deeply and being returned to earth at more distant points than those of lower frequency. Also when the layers are effectively at their greatest heights, during the night, the range of the reflected ray will be greatest. Fig. 5 shows the simpler aspects of wave propagation in diagrammatic form ; the lines representing wave tracks under various conditions. Thus A and B represent 7 and 14 Me (40 and12 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 20 metres) paths during the day, and C and D the same paths at night. There is for each frequency a limiting steepness above which reflection is not possible, after 'which the layer is penetrated, and so it will be seen that outside the range of a score or so miles of the ground wave, nothing can be received until such distance as the reflected wave appears ; leaving a large area of no signal. Skip Distance This area, which is annular in shape, is an area of no signals and its width is called the ' skip distance.” The diagram shows why the skip is greater at night than during the day, and why it is greater during both periods for the higher frequency. Weak signals may occur inside the skip distance but these are due to a certain amount of scattering at the place of reflection and are not true reflected signals. It is often impossible to receive British amateurs on the 14 Me band in Great Britain, except when inside their ground-wave range, but their signals are coming down in America, Asia or even further afield. On wavelengths greater than about 200 metres, reflection is always possible at any angle and so the skip area does not exist, although the change-over from the Heaviside to the Appleton layer during night is evident. On medium waves used for broadcasting (200-600 metres), the more distant European stations are only weak in this country as a number of hops are involved to cover the distance, with considerable loss at each earth or sky reflection. After sunset, when the Heaviside layer gives place to the Appleton layer greater strides are made and the distant stations are more easily received. As the wavelength is shortened or the frequency increased the skip becomes greater until at some limiting frequency the wave is not sufficiently bent to follow round the curvature of the earth, and long distance propagation is no longer possible. This limit was until recently about 25 Me (12 metres), but in the last two years, due to increased activity on the part of the sun, the limit has moved above 30 Me and long distance working on the 28 Me amateur band has become good at times. The upper frequency limit shows great variation with changes in the reflecting layers and offers an easy method for the study of short-wave transmission. The wavelength of 7 metres, chosen for Television work, is normally beyond the upper limit and can only be received in the range of the ground wave, though authentic cases have occurred where reflection apparently became possible for a while and 7 or even 5 metre signals have been heard over distances of several thousand miles. The 28 and 56 Me bands are now occupying the attention of advanced amateur workers, though whether long distance communication will ever become regular on the latter frequency remains to be seen. It is quite to be expected that in the years to come, with decreasing solar activity, the upper limit will recede to lower frequencies. The general variation seems to follow the known eleven-year cycle of the sun, but it will be necessary to watch over many years before the general trend can be established. The daytime signals on 7 and 14 Me are usually not very strong because these are never completely reflected, part of their energy passing through the lower layer to be reflected by the upper. as indicated by the dotted track E in Fig. 5. Because of this loss, and the number of hops that would be involved, the daytime range is not very great. At night, reflection from the more intense upper layer, and the longer stride, allow much greater distances to be covered and world-wide range is possible. Long distance propagation takes place by means of the upper layer, and the highest frequency tracks appear to use this layer only. In the daytime the waves must pass through the lower layer and suffer considerable loss. In commercial communication high power is used, but in amateur work effective long-distance communication is only possible at hours which favour the required direction. Fading It is usually possible to find more than one path by which a signal can travel from one place to another, and these paths differ in length, so that it is possible for the two positive crests of the w-aves to arrive together, or alternatively one positive crest can arrive by one path and a negative crest by the other. In the former case they will add to strengthen the signal, whilst in the latter they will oppose and weaken it. Now the reflecting layers are seldom perfectly steady, and so as they move the two or more waves can move in and out of step, causing undulations in the strength of signal received. This effect is known as ” fading,” and sometimes a fade from maximum to minimum can occupy several minutes, whilst at others, and particularly on higher frequencies, the fading cycle can be so rapid as to sound like an audio frequency modulation. Naturally the effect is very pronounced when some part of the track from transmitter to receiver is in the shadow edge of sunset or sunrise, involving transition of the reflections from one layer to another. Amateur Bands Amateurs are permitted by international agree ment to transmit continuous wave telegraphy and telephony in small channels of frequency which are usually referred to as the 1 • 7 Me, 3 • 5 Me, 7 Me, 14 Me, 28 Me and 56 Me bands. The actual frequencies are set out in detail in a later chapter, but it should be mentioned here that the 1 -7 Me band is just below the medium broadcast band, and is useful for British and European working. The 3-5 Me band falls between 75 and 90 metres and besides offering a useful channel for local working, it permits long distance communica tion during the winter months. The 7 Me band is used extensively for both short and long distance contacts, but is losing some of its popularity for DX (long distance) work, owing to the enormous amount of interference from local stations. The skip effect on this band frequently permits the reception of European and long distance stations simultaneously, which as a consequence demands the use of a highly selective receiver in order to eliminate the unwanted local (European) signal if DX stations are to be contacted. For all-round long distance work the 14 Me band has no equal, but in common with all other amateur bands the best time, or best period must be chosen if reliable contacts are to be established. As a general rule East Coast American amateurs can be worked from Great Britain on this band at mostA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 13 hours of the day, but the more distant North Americans have peak periods which usually occur just before sunset in winter, or in the early morning (06 00-08-00 GMT) in summer. The 28 Me band still presents something i,f an enigma by virtue of its inherent unreliability as a DX medium, but in recent years (1935-1937) many important data have been collected. As an example many readers will remember the outstanding feats recorded in the national Press during October, 1935, when several well-known British amateurs made historical first contacts with distant places on this frequency. The return to “ good conditions ” on 28 Me was prophesied by radio amateurs, who had formed the opinion that long distance working would become possible when a new sunspot maximum occurred. That this theory has been proved correct is but an instance of the intensive research being carried out by experimenters. It is impossible in this chapter to discuss the sunspot theory, or to do more than mention a recently discovered phenomenon known as the Dellinger effect, but those who are interested in these subjects will find the Society’s Research and Experimental Section (Propagation Section) a most valuable medium for the exchange of information. During the past three years considerable research work has been carried out by amateurs working on frequencies in the order of 56-60 Me. This band has even more intriguing possibilities than the 28-30 Me band, especially in view of the fact that on rare occasions distances up to several thousands of miles have been covered. As mentioned in an earlier paragraph frequencies higher than about 30 Me are not expected to be reflected to any appreciable extent, in fact until recently most experimenters were of the opinion that the range of 56 Me transmissions was optical. With the increase in solar activity and by the employment of more advanced apparatus amateurs are hoping to prove whether long distance communication is possible at certain periods. The R.S.G.B. have sponsored numerous 56 Me tests and it is anticipated that many more will be arranged in the future. At the time of writing the 56-60 Me band is internationally assigned to amateurs and experimenters. Very little work has been recorded on the metre wavelengths (112 and 224 Me) but groups of amateurs are continually experimenting in this connection. Before passing on to the next subject it should be mentioned that the amateur bands are in approximate harmonic relationship, i.e., the frequencies are multiples of the lowest frequency. This fact is of great advantage in the design of crystal controlled transmitters as will be seen later. Reception of Waves By a kind of inverse of the radiation process, an electromagnetic wave arriving at an aerial can set in motion some of the electrons of the wire, and these in turn can be made to produce a minute alternating voltage which can be magnified in the receiving instrument until it is great enough to deliver its message. Now at the transmitting end we can radiate any desired amount of power, and generally this power is uniformly spread out in all directions, and so the receiving system can only collect a minute amount proportional to its size. Thus, at 1,000 miles from the transmitter where the energy may be regarded as spread out round a circle about 3,000 miles in circumference, a receiving system a mile long could only collect one three-thousandth part of the energy under the best possible conditions, and in practice, owing to losses on the route, considerably less than this would be received. An aerial a mile long is beyond ambition, and the type of aerial possible in amateur installations far smaller, and its receiving power proportionately less. It will thus be seen that receivers need to be extremely sensitive. In broadcast reception the voltage available for the receiver is often of the order of 1/1,000th part of a volt, and in amateur long distance work the receiver seldom collects more than a few millionths of a volt. In commercial point-to-point communication, where the location of the receiver is known, the energy is concentrated in a narrow beam in that direction and thus a considerable gain is obtained, 100 times being practicable ; although there are limits to the extent to which this system can be carried. At the receiving end the inverse process does not give a corresponding gain because the aerial can only intercept the energy crossing the area it occupies, but directive reception helps greatly in reducing interfering signals and noises from extraneous directions. In amateur work in the past it has been desirable to be able to communicate with stations in many widely separated places, and directive aerial systems have not been used to much extent, but in recent years attention has been paid to directivity. With an ever-increasing number of amateur stations in the world it has become necessary to discover a means of avoiding the interference which their signals, jostling for room, tend to make. An increase of the power radiated only helps one receiver and aggravates the others. Directive transmission helps the desired receiver by giving it more energy, and at the same time tends to prevent interference with receivers in other directions, whilst directive reception helps to keep out undesired signals. High directivity is not desirable in amateur work, and in fact not usually possible, but simple directivity has been found a great advantage, and large numbers of amateurs are now experimenting in this direction. Some of the simpler directive sending and receiving aerial systems will be discussed in the chapter dealing with Aerials. The Valve For the reason that the whole art of high fre quency radio communication is based fundamentally upon the valve, it is desirable that some brief mention should be made here of the principles underlying its operation. The simplest form is the diode or two-element valve ; it is this class of valve which we use in our rectifiers. When the cathode or filament of a diode is heated, electrons are emitted within the valve, and pass to the anode or plate, assuming the anode is positive in respect to the cathode. If we connect a battery with its negative terminal to the cathode and its positive terminal to the plate a continuous flow of electrons takes place in the one direction. If instead of a battery we connect a source of alternating current to the anode and12 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 20 metres) paths during the day, and C and D the same paths at night. There is for each frequency a limiting steepness above which reflection is not possible, after which the layer is penetrated, and so it will be seen that outside the range of a score or so miles of the ground wa\e, nothing can be received until such distance as the reflected wave appears ; leaving a large area of no signal. Skip Distance This area, which is annular in shape, is an area of no signals and its width is called the ' skip distance.” The diagram shows why the skip is greater at night than during the day, and why it is greater during both periods for the higher frequency. Weak signals may occur inside the skip distance but these are due to a certain amount of scattering at the place of reflection and are not true reflected signals. It is often impossible to receive British amateurs on the 14 Me band in Great Britain, except when inside their ground-wave range, but their signals are coming down in America, Asia or even further afield. On wavelengths greater than about 200 metres, reflection is always possible at any angle and so the skip area does not exist, although the change-over from the Heaviside to the Appleton layer during night is evident. On medium waves used for broadcasting (200-600 metres), the more distant European stations are only weak in this country as a number of hops are involved to cover the distance, with considerable loss at each earth or sky reflection. After sunset, when the Heaviside layer gives place to the Appleton layer greater strides are made and the distant stations are more easily received. As the wavelength is shortened or the frequency increased the skip becomes greater until at some limiting frequency the wave is not sufficiently bent to follow round the curvature of the earth, and long distance propagation is no longer possible. This limit was until recently about 25 Me (12 metres), but in the last two years, due to increased activity on the part of the sun, the limit has moved above 30 Me and long distance working on the 28 Me amateur band has become good at times. The upper frequency limit shows great variation with changes in the reflecting layers and offers an easy method for the study of short-wave transmission. The wavelength of 7 metres, chosen for Television work, is normally beyond the upper limit and can only be received in the range of the ground wave, though authentic cases have occurred where reflection apparently became possible for a while and 7 or even 5 metre signals have been heard over distances of several thousand miles.

The actual frequencies are set out in detail in a later chapter, but it should be mentioned here that the 1 - 7 Me band is just below the medium broadcast band, and is useful for British and European working.

As a general rule East Coast American amateurs can be worked from Great Britain on this band at mostA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 15 resistance is called “ Radiation Resistance,” and is an imaginary resistance which may be considered to account for the energy which is radiated into space. Suppose we knew that 5 watts of energy were being radiated when the aerial ammeter read 0*25 amperes. Then, since the power absorbed by a resistance is its value in ohms multiplied by the square of the current it carries, the radiation resistance of the aerial must be (•25) or 80 ohms. With the same aerial carrying 0-3 amperes the power radiated would be 80 (0-3) 2 , or 7 - 2 watts. The radiation resistance measured at the centre of a horizontal half-wave aerial is about 80 ohms. The value for a Marconi aerial may be calculated approximately by formula. It will be obvious from the foregoing that most energy is radiated when the aerial current is a maximum. A subsequent chapter deals with Aerials as a special subject. Oscillator Frequency The frequency of the wave radiated from a simple oscillator as shown in Pig. 7 is fixed mainly by the frequency of tune of the grid circuit of the valve. For this frequency we had the formula q 28 or, if one feels happier with wavelengths, we have the formula for w^avelength viz 1885 V LC (i n this case the values of L and C are in microhenrys and microfarads, but for the first case the values are in henrys and farads). Whether we work in frequency or wavelength it must be clear that the product LC is the deciding factor. Frequency Stability It is essential that the frequency of a transmitter should be maintained as constant as possible in order to produce a steady readable si'gnal which does not interfere with other transmissions. To accomplish this we must avoid swaying aerials (which might alter the capacity and hence the frequency of the transmission) ; mechanical vibra tion ; and the effects of sudden heating of the valve or other components in the oscillator circuit. Oscillators for Transmitters Numerous types of oscillator circuits have been designed, but in modern transmitters it is usual to confine the actual oscillator to the first stage of a transmitter building up the power through a series of amplifiers until the last stage is reached. This stage which is generally called the P.A. (Power Amplifier) feeds the aerial. Under the chapter entitled “ Transmitters ” different types of oscil lators are described. Keying Telegraphic communication is carried out by radiating energy for short or long periods corres ponding to the dots and dashes of the Morse code. To achieve this result a key must be inserted in some part of the transmitter circuit which will interrupt the plate or grid supply to one or more valves. Numerous keying methods have been developed and these will be mentioned in a later chapter. For the reason that a transmitting station may cause interference to receivers connected to neigh bouring aerials, it is necessary for amateurs to arrange their keying methods in such a manner as to reduce this effect to a minimum. Suggested methods for overcoming “ key clicks ” and “ wipe out ” are described elsewhere in this handbook. Telephony Modulation Instead of completely interrupting the output of the transmitter to produce telegraphic signals we may vary, i.e., modulate, the amplitude of the high frequency currents at an audible frequency, or to the same wave shape as that of ordinary speech and music. The aerial current would be1G A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO of the form indicated in Fig. 8 where the dotted lines represent the “ modulation envelope.” There are many methods of achieving this object, those most suited for amateur use being described elsewhere. Television Modulation In the case of Television, the process of modula tion is fundamentally the same as in telephony. The modulation envelope has a shape determined by the variations of illumination in the scene trans mitted. Fig. 9 is a typical example of a television modulation envelope which will be explained in greater detail in Chapter 14. Efficiency The power input to the plate of a valve is easily calculated : multiply the plate current expressed in amperes by the normal plate voltage. In an oscillator circuit some of this power is converted into H.F. energy and may be radiated from the aerial, whilst some merely heats the plate. It is an obvious advantage to have as much converted to H.F. as possible, and to keep the plate heating at a minimum, i.e., to work the valve at high efficiency. Quartz Control The best type of oscillator is one which has its frequency controlled by a small slice of quartz. The quartz crystal takes the place of a tuned circuit in the oscillator and is mounted between two smooth brass plates, the top one usually being fairly light and carrying a fine wire connection. If a slice is cut in a certain manner from a large quartz crystal it will be found to have “ piezo electric ” properties, i.e., if the slice is squeezed between two metal surfaces it will produce between them a small difference of potential or voltage. Conversely, if a small potential difference is applied to the plates the crystal will shrink or expand, according to the direction of the strain. Like everything mechanical the crystal has a natural frequency of mechanical vibration, and if we apply pulses of voltage to the plates at this exact frequency the crystal will increase and decrease in thickness as it oscillates mechanically. This shrinking and growing produces, of course, the piezo-electric voltages between the plates; a shrinking produces one direction of potential difference ” (P.D.) and growing the opposite P.D. Frequency Multiplying Any periodic variation may be shown to be made up of sine waves of different frequencies. The distorted wave of Fig. 10 (c) is obtained by adding the two waves (a) and (6). The wave [b) is double the frequency of (a), and is therefore called a “ second harmonic ” of the (a) frequency. When a sine wave variation is applied to the grid of a valve working on the straight part of its characteristic the superimposed wave on the plate current is an exact image of the grid variation. This is the condition of distortionless amplification. But if the valve is biased so that the grid variation falls on the lower curve of the characteristic, the plate current variation will no longer be a pure sine wave but the distorted wave as shown in Fig. 11. This distorted wave will be of the same type as Fig. 10 (c), and therefore we know that it is composed of a second harmonic as well as a fundamental frequency. A condenser and induc tance placed in parallel in the plate circuit, and tuned to twice the fundamental frequency, will trap this component (Fig. 12); the voltage across this trap circuit may be employed to drive further stages at twice the frequency we started with, or the frequency may be doubled again with another valve biased right down to “ cut-off.” When the tuning of a frequency doubler stage is passing the correct setting the plate milliammeterwill be noticed to kick downwards and when tuned to the minimum meter reading it will be found that a loop of wire connected to a flashlamp bulb and held near the inductance will indicate double-frequency current present by the glow in the bulb. Power Amplifier When a valve is used merely for amplification and does not provide its own grid excitation, it is called a power amplifier (P.A.) and its work is inA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 17 c some ways similar to that of the output stage of a receiver. A triode valve used for amplifying H.F. is decidedly unstable ; with a tuned input circuit and a tuned output circuit it becomes what i« known as a “ Tuned Plate-Tuned Grid Oscillator,” and would act as such if we took no steps to prevent self oscillation. Some of the H.F. energy in the tuned output circuit finds its way back through the plate-grid capacity and stray wiring capacities to the grid input circuit Only a small amount of such feed back energy is sufficient to make the valve oscillate of its own accord. If it is to function properly as an amplifier it must not oscillate. One way of overcoming this effect is to neutralise the circuit as described in the next paragraph, but recently screened grid or pentode valves suitable for transmitting purposes have been designed in which the grid anode capacity has been made so small that neutralisation is frequently unnecessary. Fig. 12. Neutralising The idea of neutralising is quite simple ; we do not try to prevent the plate voltage fluctuations acting across the plate-grid capacity and so affecting the grid potential, but we provide a second feed back path through a very small ‘‘ neutralising ” condenser and arrange that this second feed-back will be of opposite phase, or opposed, at every instant to the feed-back produced through the valve. Fit?. 13 will illustrate this in more detail. The H.T. tap on the coil will be a point of zero H.F. potential but, rather in the manner of a springy piece of steel held at the centre, the ends of the tuned circuit will be points of high variation, or to be more exact—great H.F. variation of potential. The plates of the condenser C will be at opposite potentials at any instant ; when one plate is positive the other will be negative. One end of the condenser C being connected to the plate will vary with the plate’s voltage ; the other end will have an opposite voltage at every instant. Both ends are connected to the grid through small capacities, one by the grid-plate capacity and the other by the ‘'neutralising condenser” (N.C.). The grid, therefore, receives opposite pulses by the two paths. If the two paths are balanced the pulses will be of equal and opposite magnitude and the grid will be unaffected ; in this case no energy is being fed back and the valve will not self-oscillate. Such a balanced condition is obtained by a careful setting of the small condenser, N.C. Various other connections may be used for neutralising but the principle is the same. An inspection of Fig 13 will show that if the circuit is properly adjusted the H.F. voltage from the drive will be passed through the two small capacities and affect equally the opposite ends of the tuned circuit. If the ends are not equally affected the drive will produce an oscillatory current in the tuned circuit. Probably the most satisfactory method of adjusting a neutralised power amplifier is that which uses a grid current meter in the circuit of the valve to be neutralised. With the H.T. removed from the amplifier and the previous stages in operation, a position of the P.A. grid condenser will be found when the grid current is at maximum. If the condenser in the amplifier plate circuit is tuned it will be observed that a deflection occurs in the grid current meter. If now the neutralising con denser is adjusted in conjunction with the previously mentioned condenser, a position will ultimately be reached when no deflection of the grid current meter occurs as the plate circuit condenser is tuned. At this stage the valve is correctly neutralised, because although the output circuit of the valve is varied, no energy is being drawn from the grid circuit. A simpler but less satisfactory method is to employ a loop of wire closed through a low consump tion flash lamp bulb and held near the anode circuit. When the bulb is illuminated the presence of oscillatory current is indicated. The neutralising condenser should be turned slowly until no current can be detected in the tuned circuit by means of the loop. To reach a final adjustment watch the driver’s plate meter and slowly swing the dial of the P.A. plate tuning condenser backwards and forwards about its proper tuning. When passing through tune, and if the P.A. is not quite neutrahsed, the energy fed through from the drive loads the18 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO drive slightly and the plate meter shows a kick upwards. Adjust the neutralising condenser until the driver’s plate meter is steady at all positions of the P.A. tuning condenser dial. The P.A. plate voltage may now be switched on and the tuned circuit set for minimum plate current to the P.A. ; the aerial can now be coupled to the P.A. tank, but make sure that this does not upset the neutralising —re-neutralise if necessary. In amateur work one often requires to change the band on which the transmitter is working—this means changing coils if the efficiency is to be maintained. In the ordinary system of neutralising just described, each coil would have three connections, and the centre one will probably not divide the coil electrically in the same ratio in each case. This, of course, means re-neutrahsing. To get over this difficulty the centre point of two capacities may be taken, and this gives rise to what is now called the Split-stator method. Fig. 14 shows these connections clearly. The principle is the same, but only two connections are required for each coil; remember it is easier to match two condensers than two parts of a coil. The two condensers are of the ' ganged ” type, and if they are accurately matched there should be no difficulty about re-neutralising after changing band. P.A. Efficiency A P.A. stage should be arranged for high efficiency. To obtain this condition the grid should be biased to twice or three times the “ cut off ” value (“ cut-off ” is that value of grid voltage which reduces the anode current to zero). This is usually achieved by using batteries and connecting a resistance of 20,000 or 30,000 ohms in series with them. When the excitation is applied the grid is swung into the positive region and grid current flows. This current flowing through the resistance in the grid circuit causes a voltage drop across it. The voltage drop is such as to make the grid more negative, and the resistance acts really as a self biasing device. Such resistance is often employed without the addition of batteries in series, but should the excitation fail, the P.A. will draw an abnormally large plate current as it will be unbiased and damage may be done. In addition, the P.A. must in such a case be keyed, as it would not be practicable to remove the excitation by keying a previous stage. With high grid-bias and high excitation voltage, the plate current will flow for only a very short period of time, and the output circuit is excited by “ flicks ” of power. This reduces the heating of the plate and increases efficiency. It also introduces harmonics as the plate current will be very dis torted ; however, the tuned circuits minimise the radiation of higher frequencies, especially with loose coupling. The output circuit should have as high an L/C ratio as possible, and the plate voltage of the valve should also be high for high efficiency. One often hears attempts at high efficiency derided on the grounds that if one is to increase the excitation to a very high amount it means more power in the pre-P.A. stage or stages, and that one is robbing Peter to pay Paul. This may be so, but further consideration will show that it is very much worth while. The power input reckoned on a cost basis— i.e., the cost of energy supplied to a transmitter of the ordinary amateur type—is not an item to be considered unless the power is derived from batteries. On the other hand, the licence limits the power input, and with a fixed power input the output depends on the efficiency. A few extra watts in the pre-P.A. stages may increase the output by only a little, but even that little is where it is wanted, and efficiencies between 80 and 90 per cent, can be obtained. There is a limit, of course, and there can be too much excitation voltage; but the usual trouble in amateur P.A. stages is under excitation. Push-Pull Just as in the output stage of a low-frequency amplifier, push-pull may be used for H.F. amplifi cation—or, indeed, nearly every operation in the transmitter. Push-pull (P.P.) has the advantage that the circuit is symmetrical to earth, and at very high frequencies this is a decided help. In P.P. the inter-electrode capacities are in series and hence less capacity is in parallel with the tuning circuit. Another advantage is that if higher power is required and the H.T. voltage is limited, the power may be doubled by using a second valve connected in P.P. with the first; the excitation required will, of course, be doubled. High-efficiency amplifiers produce strong har monics and one of the merits of the P.P. circuit is that the even harmonics are cancelled, and there isA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 19 less liability to radiate such frequencies. There is, however, more tendency to parasitic oscillation— i.e., oscillation of random frequency caused by the capacity and inductance of the wiring, usually, and not the frequency of the tuned circuits. P.P. circuits are neutralised in much the same way as the single-ended amplifier, and when neutralising, the two condensers, marked C in Fig. 15 should be varied in value together. Short-Wave Receivers Short-wave receivers differ in many ways from broadcast receivers. The coils and condensers are ui auiailer value, and the tuning range ouiy a matter of a few metres. Interchangeable plug-in coils are usually employed for band changing as switching arrangements would not only be compli cated but might be a source of serious loss and “trouble” at high frequencies. A single valve used as a grid-detector is capable of pulling in head-phone signals from the ends of the earth, but most amateurs add an additional stage of low-frequency amplification. This may be a pentode, though a triode will give all the amplification that is necessary. It should be remembered that a loud signal is not the desideratum, but a high “ signal/ background” ratio. Amplification will not improve matters if this ratio is low, and will not make the signal more readable. A leaky-grid detector followed by a single amplifying stage is a very popular arrangement, and is used in thousands of stations. The coupling between the two stages may be any of the usual types ; transformer, choke, or resistance-capacity. The reader will, no doubt, very soon make a pet of some particular circuit, as we all do sooner or later, but in the following remarks it is intended to deal only with what might be called “ standard ” methods. The aerial is not often intentionally tuned, and therefore almost any sort of aerial will prove a good collector of signals. It may be coupled to the detector grid circuit either capacitatively or inductively. At certain places on the tuning dial the aerial may impose such a load on the tuned circuit as to make oscillation difficult or impossible. Such a “ hole ” in the tuning is very awkward when it appears right on the amateur band. To dispose of the trouble the aerial coupling condenser may be set to a smaller value or a small loading inductance added to the aerial lead-in. The L/C ratio of the tuned circuit should be high as the voltage a signal produces across the grid depends upon this ratio. The range of tuning required on any one band is very small, and it is convenient to spread the band over a considerable extent of the tuning dial. This may be done by using a fixed value of “ tank ” capacity across the grid coil and having only a very small value of tuning condenser in parallel. One then varies only a small part of the total tuning capacity. For the reception of C.W., the detector must be in a state of oscillation, and the loudest signals will be obtained when the reaction condenser controlling the feed-back is set so that the set is only just oscillating. The locally produced oscil lation is of practically the same frequency as the incoming signal, and the two produce audible beats which are heard in the telephones. The frequency of the beat note is the difference of the two high frequencies, so the operator at the receiver may vary the pitch of the note by altering the tuning of the receiver. At the high frequencies used by amateurs the amount of detuning necessary to produce a beat note is not sufficient to affect the strength of the signals to any appreciable extent. The frequency of oscillation of the receiver may be above or below the signal frequency to produce the required beat note, and it is often useful to beat on one side or the other according to the extent of interference on the desired frequency. To make this clear let us take an example : suppose the desired signal is on a frequency of 7,200 kc and an interfering station is transmitting on 7,201 kc. If we set our receiver on 7,200-5 kc we would produce a beat note of 7,200-5-7,200, or 500 c.p.s. with the wanted signal; but the unwanted signal would also produce a beat frequency of 500 c.p.s. But on going to the other side of the signal and producing a frequency of 7,199-5 kc the wanted signal would again produce a 500 cycle beat, but the unwanted would produce a 1.500 cycle beat which would be easily distinguished. Superheterodyne Receivers If the receiving oscillator were set so much off frequency that the beat produced were of radio frequency, we should obtain the superheterodyne principle. This beat of radio frequency is known as the “ intermediate frequency ” (I.F.) and can be amplified by one or more I.F. amplifying stages. A second oscillatory detector could beat with this amplified I.F. and produce audible signals for the low-frequency amplifiers and telephones. Single Signal Reception It will be seen from the foregoing remarks that when a simple oscillating detector type of receiver is used, two stations separated by quite an appre ciable difference in frequency may produce the same audio note in the telephones ; in other words, a signal producing a beat note of 1,000 c.p.s. when we are tuned to 7,200 kc may produce the same beat note when we tune to 7,202 kc. Between the two frequencies the pitch of the beat note will fall out ol audibility and rise again. Only signals which are of the same frequency should cause interference. This condition is not possible to obtain with the simple oscillating detector, but is achieved very closely by a type of receiver known as the “ single signal ” superhet. A&gt; \ A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO Suppose we require to receive a signal of 7,200 kc. It may be that the conditions are as shown in Fig. 16. The lines Cl, C2 represent other stations, amateur or commercial, and' the lines Ol, 02 represent two possible frequencies for the local oscillator (to produce the intermediate frequency beat note of, in this case, 500 kc). Suppose the detector circuit is tuned to the 7,200 kc signal and the separate oscillator is tuned to 7,700 kc (the position 02) the beat is 500 kc as required and is amplified by the 500 kc I.F. amplifier as a radio frequency signal. But the inteiference C2 on 8,200 kc will also beat with the oscillator and produce the same intermediate frequency. However, it is 1,000 kc “off tune ” and the input circuits will be sufficiently selective, or can be made so, to prevent trouble from this “ radio frequency image.” The higher the I.F. the easier it is to prevent this trouble, but the I.F. should not be too high or amplification falls off, and the medium broadcast band should be avoided. The frequency usually used is about 500 kc. Changing the oscillator frequency to Ol is not always a solution, as there may be interference at Cl producing the same trouble. Another trouble arises with two stations such as B1 and B2 : they beat with one another to produce the I.F., and do so without the help of the separate oscillator. If they produce any response in the input circuits, they will come in together on top of any signal that is being received. Again, the selectivity of the input circuits should be sufficient to prevent such signals being received. A stage of high- frequency amplification before the detector should eliminate the possibility of either trouble. If such troubles have been eliminated by the input circuits we are left with signals such as A which is only 2 kc off resonance, and this may quite possibly be a very loud signal from a local station. The input circuits will not show any discrimination between these two signals, the selectivity of high frequency circuits being poor. Thus the I.F. amplifier wall receive two signals— the required one at 500 kc and if we use the oscillator setting 02 the interfering signal at 498 kc. There will, of course, be a heterodyne oscillator coupled to the second detector to produce an audible beat with the CVV signal. If the heterodyne oscil lator is tuned to 499 kc to produce a 1,000 c.p.s. beat, it will also be producing the same beat with the interference. However, by tuning to the peak of the I.F. ^ resonance curve, the required signal will be given considerable preference. This is shown in Fig 17. The preference is increased as the selectivity of the I F. circuits is increased, and this can be achieved by reducing the resistance of the I F. circuits by regeneration (“ reaction ). This method of disposing of the audio-frequency “ image ” interference is successful to a very large extent, but the ratio ' signal/noise level ” is not as high as when the selectivity is produced by using a quartz crystal. Such a crystal behaves like a very selective circuit when suitably coupled to the I.F. amplifier, and will allow the ' image ” at, in this case 2 kc off resonance, to be reduced to inaudibility. This type of receiver has become very popular and is a great advance from the point of view of selectivity. Micro Waves As the frequency is increased into the ultra band, there is an increasing difficulty in obtaining good efficiencies. This has led to the development of several types of oscillator working on quite different lines from the usual form. There is the Barkhausen oscillator, for example, in which there is no tuned circuit; the grid is given a higher potential than the plate—both through chokes —and the output is delivered to a pair of parallel conductors connected with plate and grid. The principle of this oscillator is that the electrons are attracted to the grid but shoot through its meshes and come into the region of the lower plate potential. They slow up and swing back to the grid. They may miss the meshes again. They finally fall into the grid, but may make several oscillations through its meshes before doing so. The frequency is determined primarily by the grid potential. Gill-Morrell oscillations are really Barkhausen oscillations generated when a tuned circuit is con nected to the oscillator ; the tuned circuit is found to have a modifying influence on the frequency. The Magnetron valve is now often used for generating appreciable powers at ultra-high fre quencies. It consists of a split anode of cylindrical form surrounding a filament. The tuned circuit is connected between the plates and the H.T. is sup plied to the plates by a centre tap on the coil. The valve requires a rather bulky magnetic field system, but is capable of producing comparatively large powers at good efficiencies, but it is difficult to modulate the oscillations. Conclusion An attempt has been made in this chapter to set out briefly certain fundamental principles governing the operation of radio frequency circuits. In the space available it has not been possible to enlarge upon any one subject, but it is hoped that the beginner will find pointers to many of the problems which are likely to require solution once he decides to make amateur radio his hobby. Frequently throughout the chapter the reader is referred to later pages of this book. He will be well advised to follow up these amplified references and read them in conjunction with the fundamental explanations given herein.21 CHAPTER THREE ■MMR A Modern Valves . . . and their applications I T is intended in this chapter to cover a general survey of modern valves, but before the various types are dealt with, it may be best to explain briefly the theory of operation of a valve and the constants and nomenclature in general use. Theory The simplest form of valve is the Two Electrode or Diode, which consists of a filament (or cathode) and an anode, the latter surrounding the filament more or less completely. The two electrodes are contained in a bulb in vacuum; the reason for the vacuum we will come to in a moment. If the filament be heated to a fairly high temperature, the molecules of which the filament is composed will be in a state of violent agitation. If the tempera ture is high enough atoms composing the molecules will fly off from the filament; these atoms have numbers of free electrons associated with them. Now when an electron tends to leave the parent molecule the latter becomes positively charged due to the fact that the number of electrons re maining are insufficient to neutralise the positive charge in the molecule. The electrons themselves being negatively charged, there is, as a result, a force tending to pull back these electrons to the filament. So we place a positively charged body (the anode) near the hot filament in order to attract these electrons. As they travel through the space between the filament and anode they may encounter molecules of gas, these molecules impede their progress, and consequently, it is essential that the amount of gas in the valve should be a minimum, and it should be what we call “ Hard.” If there is some gas present, the collision between the electrons and molecules of gas will ionise the gas and a visible blue haze will appear between the electrodes. As there are electrons travelling from the filament to the anode, they form a cloud in the intervening space, this cloud of electrons is in itself an electric field or charge in the space between the filament and anode, hence its name “ Space charge.” This charge tends to repel the electrons leaving the fila ment because it is of the same polarity, hence the potential applied to the anode (H.T. voltage) must be sufficient to overcome the repelling force of the space charge. If sufficient potential be applied to the anode, electrons will travel from filament to anode, and via, the external circuit back to the filament. This means that there is an electron flow externally from anode to filament, and due to the fact that current as we know it is in the opposite direction to electron flow, a meter will show current flowing from the positive H.T. to the anode. If we raise the H.T. voltage or anode potential, the electron flow or current will increase, and it will continue to increase wdth increase in voltage up to a point when the space charge is completely neutralised, and we reach the “ Total Emission ” of the filament. This value can only be altered by changing the filament temperature. It will be obvious that if we apply no potential or a negative potential to the anode, there will be no electron flow due to the space charge being unneutralised, hence in regard to the anode current, the valve is a The 362 RFP 30 Transmitting Pentode suitable for suppressor grid modulation with powers up to 30 watts. 1.

Suppressor Grid. ’*22 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO unilateral device, in other words, current can only flow in the anode circuit in one direction; thus the principal use of a diode is as a rectifier. In order that we may control the anode current by other means another electrode is placed between the cathode and the anode, known as a “ Grid,” which consists of a helix of fine wire; this addition turns the Diode into a Triode. The object of the grid is that by varying the potential on it, we can modify the space charge in the same way as by varying the anode voltage, and hence vary the anode current. The grid being an open helix or mesh it does not present any obstacle to the electron flow. As long as the grid potential is negative with respect to the cathode or negative end of the filament it will attract no free electrons, but if it becomes positive, electrons will flow to it in the same way as to the anode and “ grid current ” will pass. If the grid is varied up and down in potential the anode current will vary in the same way, and if a resistance or load is connected in the anode circuit, a voltage drop will be obtained across it, also varying in the same way. If this resistance has a suitable value the variation of voltage drop will be of greater amplitude than that of the variation of grid voltage, hence the property of the triode valve to amplify. The ratio of the change of anode current to the change of grid voltage is known as the “ Mutual Conductance ” (g) and is measured in milliamperes per volt. If we make the grid more negative and then raise the anode voltage, or make the grid less negative and lower the anode voltage, we can arrange the values such as to keep the anode current constant, and of the same value in each case. The Standard Telephones and Cables 4316A. Transmitting Acorn suitable for operation up to 600 Me Scale: Full Size The ratio of change of anode volts to change of grid volts for constant anode current is known as the “Amplification Factor” (p). The amplification factor divided by the mutual conductance is known as the ' Impedance ” (Ra) or A.C. resistance of the valve, and appears like a resistance in series with the external H.T. circuit. In this figure the mutual conductance must be in amps, per volt to get the units right. The resistance or load that we connect in the anode circuit is known as the “ Load Impedance ” ; this has a value for triode valves as a rule between one and ten times the valve impedance for output triodes, 1.6 times being about the best value. When we apply an input of A.C. voltage to the grid, an amplified A.C. voltage appears across the output load in the anode circuit, and due to there being a capacity between the grid and anode acting as a condenser, some of this voltage gets back to the grid again; whether it appears in a direction tending to aid the input voltage or to cancel it depends on the type of load in the anode, i.e. inductance, capacity or resistance. Since the reactance of a condenser is lowest at high frequencies, the feed back from anode to grid becomes most serious at high frequencies, causing either instability or low amplification depending on the output load. In an endeavour to overcome this difficulty a Screen-grid valve was invented. A screen-grid valve or Tetrode is a triode valve having a screen between grid and anode, so that instead of a capacity between grid and anode, there is a capacity between grid and screen, and anode and screen; the screen has a lower voltage applied to it than the anode, but is virtually connected to the cathode {i.e. via a large condenser). Nevertheless, some capacity exists due to the fact that the screen has a grid formation, in order that electrons can pass through it to the anode, but its magnitude is far lower than that of a triode.A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 23 VALVE DEVELOPMENTS BY 1932 Hivac introduced the Faraday Box Shielding to the Screened Grid valve construction, resulting in the lowest possible control grid to anode capacities. 1934 Hivac introduced a range of Multi-electrode 2-volt “ Midget ” valves. © 1935 Hivac introduced the Beam Power Output Tetrode, embodyingthe Harries “ Critical Anode Distance ” discovery. 1936 To meet the exacting requirements of Short-wave experimenters, Hivac produced a range of Special Short-wave valves. 1937 THE ALL-STAGE VALVE This is a Multi-Grid Critical Distance valve which is so constructed, that it makes possible the production of a Multi-Valve receiver, such as a superhet, using only one type of valve throughout.

Designed by Amateur Transmitters for Amateur Transmittersmmmmumrn WWM A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 25 A Pentode valve is merely a screen-grid valve having an additional grid between the screen and the anode, the object being to prevent a kink in the characteristic which occurs when the anode voltage of a screen-grid valve is lower than the screen voltage ; this kink is known as ' Secondary Emission ” effect. Briefly the explanation is that when an electron hits a body such as the anode, electrons are knocked off. These electrons will be attracted to any body at higher potential than the anode—in this case, the screen—which causes a drop in the anode current, .and a corresponding rise in the screen current. In a Pentode the effect of this grid, which is earthed, between the screen and anode, is to repel these secondary electrons back to the anode and prevent them reaching the screen. In the above description a number of constants and definitions have been defined and explained, but as there are a few more in general use applicable to most types of valves, these are given below. Anode Dissipation is the power in watts expended in loss in the anode of a valve and is dissipated as heat ; this must not be confused with either power output or power input (anode watts from H.T.). In any valve the anode dissipation is the remaining power left after the useful R.F. or L.F. power output has been deducted from the power input, i.e., the H.T. supply. In the case of amplifiers operating under Class A, or normal bias conditions, the anode dissipation is near enough to be considered as the input power, but for oscillators or Class B, C or driven Class A amplifiers the dissipation may be only 40 per cent, of the input power, depending on the efficiency obtained. The Osram Z.A1 K.F. Pentode Acorn type, suit' .able Xor ultra short-wave re ceiver. Power Output is always a relative and often ambiguous term as a definite figure is difficult to rely on, as in the case ol an amplifier the harmonic content of the output must be stated, and in the case of oscillators the circuit conditions and frequency must be known. For Class A amplifiers the approxi mate power output may be calculated by multi plying the R.M.S. input voltage (0 -707 X grid bias) by the mutual conductance at the operating point, squaring the result and multiplying this by the output load impedance. Load Lines are lines which can be drawn on the anode volts—anode current curves of a valve from which the power output and harmonic content can be studied. For example, in Fig. 7, which is referred to again later, the line AB represents a load impedance given by 450 volts 180 mA i.e., 2,500 ohms. Input Impedance is the apparent resistance of the grid to cathode or filament of a valve, and is a figure difficult to determine as it is dependent on the frequency and the type of load in the anode circuit of the valve {i.e., inductive, resistive, etc.). In the case of triodes it is approximately equal to the reactance of a condenser, whose value is the grid to anode capacity multiplied by the amplification factor, but in the case of screened grid and pentode valves the grid to anode capacity is very small and no approximate figure can be calculated. Grid Emission is the condition where the grid of a valve commences to emit electrons itself and, so to speak, competes with the cathode, resulting in grid current flowing. If a high resistance is present between the grid and cathode the current will be in such a direction as to neutralise the grid bias and, at the same time, damp the circuit heavily. The effect is due to the heating of the grid by the close proximity of the hot cathode and by radiated heat from the anode ; the effect is accentuated if any active cathode coating adheres to the grid. The effects are avoided by keeping the grid-cathode resistance path low and avoiding excessive heater or anode temperatures {i.e., avoid overrunning the valve). Anode Emission is similar to grid emission but occurs when the anode attains sufficient temperature to emit electrons ; this effect gives most trouble in the case of rectifiers causing breakdown between anode and cathode (or filament) or loss of emission. Conversion Conductance is a term used in conjunc tion with detectors or frequency changers and is the ratio of the input voltage of one frequency to the output current of another frequency, as in a 1st detector of a superheterodyne receiver. The con version conductance is the current in the anode circuit of I.F. in micro-amperes divided by the input voltage to the grid of R.F., the symbol being p a V. Conversion Gain or Translation Gain is the ratio of I.F. output voltage to the R.F. input volts. The figure is bound up with the dynamic resistance of the T.F. transformer used in the anode circuit. Both are a measure of the efficiency of the valve as a detector or frequency changer. Types of Valves It is proposed next to deal with the various types of valves and cover briefly their usual applications with such remarks as are applicable. The valves will be grouped into two classes :— (1) Those suitable for receiving purposes. (2) Those suitable for transmitting purposes. Amongst the latter class some of the receiving types find application in low- power stages or transmitters. (I) Receiving Valves Amongst the receiving valves figure those of the filamentary type commonly known as battery or26 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO directly heated, and the indirectly heated type. It is not proposed to deal separately with each type as almost any receiving valve has a counterpart in both types. (a) Triodes. The general tendency during recent years has been to considerably increase the efficiency of triodes. This is marked in the battery type by an improved performance for a lower filament power consumption, and in the indirectly heated type by a very improved mutual conductance resulting in a higher amplification factor or a lower impedance, or both. The use of a modern triode does not involve any new difficulties except that the higher stage gain obtainable requires precautions in de coupling and in the prevention of parasitic oscillation. (b) Pentodes. The modern pentode comprises two classes :— the radio frequency pentode and the L.F. output pentode. The former has almost entirely replaced the screen grid valve due to the fact that an R.F. pentode is capable of handling a much larger signal without distortion and at the same time giving a higher stage gain. The anode impedance being higher, there is less damping on the tuned circuit connected in series with the anode and selectivity is in consequence higher. R.F. pentodes are obtainable with straight or variable p, characteristics. A usual application is as an R.F. or I.F. amplifier, but they are also very useful as a combined first detector and oscillator in a superheterodyne receiver. R.F. pentodes may also be used for a frequency changer by injecting a local oscillation from an oscillator valve, which may also be a pentode, into the suppressor grid. A typical circuit of such an arrangement is shown in Fig. 1. Suppressor Grid Injection Frequency Changer. The majority of types are obtainable with the suppressor grid brought out to a separate pin. an advantage in certain types of oscillator circuits. The modern L.F. output pentodes are much more efficient than their predecessors, some of the indirectly heated type giving 3 watts output for an input swing of around 3 volts and having a mutual conductance of about 12 mA/V. Others, namely, in the A.C.—D.C. range, give 2 watts output with anode and screen voltages as low as 130 volts, and 1 watt with less than 100 volts. The battery types are correspondingly also more efficient. too '**&lt;*000 a. (c) Double Diode Triode. Double Diode Triode valves comprise a high gain triode with two diodes, efficiently screened from the triode, having a common cathode or filament. The chief application is in circuits using automatic volume control. The types of circuit are legion but in the main comprise full or half-wave diode detection with L.F. amplification, with or without a delay voltage on the A.V.C., or, in addition, using the triode as a direct current amplifier as well as L.F., giving the above variations of arrangement with amplified A.V.C. Fig. 2 shows a typical circuit using one diode (Dl) for the L.F. output and the other diode (D2) for the A.V.C. voltage, the A.V.C. being delayed by the amount of the bias of the triode, namely, the drop across the auto-bias resistance Rl. Other useful applications are in valve voltmeter circuits and other types of measuring apparatus. A variation is the Treble Diode Triode, which has an additional diode enabling the advantage of Quiet Amplified and Delayed A.V.C. in one valve, where previously an additional valve has been necessary. {d) Double Diode Pentode. This valve comprises an L.F. output pentode and two diodes usually mounted as a separate unitA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 27 within the same bulb. It has most of the uses of a double diode triode and can be used where the R.F. voltage on the diodes is reasonable in magnitude, and in consequence the L.F. amplification need not be great. Another variation comprises an H.F. pentode and two diodes, this valve performing the function of an R.F. or I.F. amplifier followed by diode detection. {e) Triode Pentode. Triode pentodes were introduced a few years ago for use as combined detector oscillators in super heterodyne receivers. They comprise a small triode and an R.F. pentode screened from each other but having a common cathode. The triode is arranged as an oscillator injecting its oscillations into the common cathode lead of the R.F. pentode. The advantages are small harmonic content, giving freedom from ' squeaks ” at parts of the tuning range, no pulling of oscillator frequency by tuning the R.F. circuits and a high conversion gain. Fig. 3 shows a typical circuit The triode pentode is unsuitable for use on short waves in general due to the necessity for using cathode injection which causes locking between the oscillator and the R.F. signal. Fig. 3. Circuit for Triode Pentode. (/) Pentagrids or Heptodes. A Pcntagrid consists of a screen grid and a triode element coupled by a common cathode electron stream. It comprises, in order : a heater and cathode or filament, five grids and an anode ; the grids in order being : (1) triode control grid, (2) triode anode, (3) electrostatic screen, (4) screen grid control grid and (5) screen. The triode is screened from the tetrode (screen grid) unit by the electrostatic screen (.grid 3) ; hence, if the triode is connected up in any conventional oscillator circuit the tetrode unit will be modulated by the oscillator solely by virtue of the variations of the electron stream from the cathode due to the triode. A typical circuit is shown in Fig. 4. The tetrode unit has a variable ;x characteristic enabling A.V.C. to be applied to the frequency changer, giving improved A.V.C. operation. All the advantages possessed by the triode pentode (e) apply to the pentagrid except that the harmonic content is slightly larger but not large enough to give any trouble. A pentagrid is quite satisfactory for use in short-wave frequency changers in general, but difficulties may be encountered due to a small residual coupling between No. 2 and No. 4 grids, causing a drop in conversion gain when the signal frequency and the oscillator frequency are very close together. In some cases this effect may be bucked out by means of a very small capacity between No. 1 and No. 4 grids. Also there is a drift in the oscillator frequency when the grid bias on the control grid (No. 4) is varied, as with A.V.C., amounting to about 0-01 per cent. These effects can be largely overcome by driving No. 1 grid from a separate oscillator, preferably of an electron-coupled type. Pentagrid valves may be used in push-pull for ultra short-wave work, i.e. 28 and 56 Me, the control grids (4) being in push-pull and grids 1 and 2 in parallel; this arrangement enables satisfactory oscillation to be obtained on these frequencies. These valves are obtainable in A.C., A.C.-D.C., -and battery types. (g) Hexagrids or Octodes. As their name implies, they have six grids or eight electrodes. They are essentially the same as pentagrids with the addition of a suppressor grid converting the screened-grid unit into an R.F. pentode. They have no great advantage over a pentagrid except the fact that when the input voltage of R.F. is large there is less change of over load and consequent cross-modulation. The con version gain is of the same order, but they give somewhat improved performance on the short waves. (h) Triode Hexodes. A Triode Hexode comprises a triode valve and a m xer valve having a common cathode. The mixer has four grids between the cathode and the f^. 4. Typical circuit using a Pentagrid.28 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO anode, the first grid is the control grid and has vari-^x characteristics, the second is an electrostatic screen, the third is the oscillator grid and is con nected internally to the triode grid, and the fourth grid is a screen and is strapped to No. 2 grid. The triode is connected in any conventional oscillator circuit as is shown in Fig. 5. The valve will give a higher conversion gain than the pentagrid, due to the fact that the control grid is nearest the cathode and in consequence has the highest mutual conductance ; also the valve does not suffer from an oscillator drift due to A.V.C. or to coupling between the oscillator and signal grid, although it has all the advantages of elect ionic coupling. The amplitude of the oscillator requires to be in the order of 12 volts R.M.S. (i) Triple Twin. A triple twin valve is a special type of output valve comprising two triodes contained in one bulb internally connected as a direct coupled amplifier. The cathode of the first triode (input triode) is connected to the grid of the second triode (output triode). The anode of the input triode is connected to H/JT. and the output of the 1st triode is the grid cathode impedance of the 2nd triode, the output load in effect being in its cathode instead of its anode. No external grid bias is required and the power output is of a higher order than a triode or pentode, being over 4 watts for one valve and over 12 watts for two in push-pull. See Fig. 6. (j) Beam Power Output Valve. The Beam is the latest type of output valve. It is a Tetrode (i.e. screen-grid output valve), but employs principles used in Cathode Ray tubes, in that the electron stream is focused towards the anode by special shaped grids arranged with their turns dead opposite and two focusing plates. The output of two in push-pull with an H.T. voltage of 400 volts is 60 watts of audio. The reason for the large power output is the fact that they are designed in such a way that the distortion is mostly 2nd harmonic with very little 3rd or higher harmonics, this result is opposite to that of a pentode, hence the large power output in push- pull where the 2nd harmonic cancels out. Fig. 7 shows the characteristic curves of a Beam valve and a pentode of equivalent size. The line AB is a load line drawn on the curve. It is seen that the line extends further to the left before it cuts the zero grid volts curve than it does for the pentode, indicating a greater power output. (k) A.C. — D.C. Types. Attention must be drawn to the ranges of valves available for A.C.—D.C. and automobile receivers. These valves can be wired up in series and used on A.C. or D.C. mains without the introduction of hum and are available in nearly all the types described above. The automobile types comprise many of the A.C.—D.C. series and are suitable for operation on a 12-volt battery, hence they have application for portable receivers in the field, and in the home may be run from a suitable transformer, no L.T. rectifier being required. (/) Acorn and Midget Valves. The first Acorn type valves to be produced in England were A.C. mains-type triodes, and R.F. pentodes of very small dimensions designed for use on ultra-high frequencies such as 56 Me and tele vision. M dget Valves are ordinary types of very small dimensions for use in portable receivers and for deaf aid apparatus. (m) Metal Valves. These valves, now popular in America, are the ordinary valve types mounted in a metal bulb, welded or brazed together, having the lead-out wires passed through eyelets of a material known as “ Fernico ” mounted in the metal bulb. They have characteristics similar to normal types, but are somewhat smaller in bulk. (») Magic Eye Tuning Indicator. This form of tuning indicator, known under various trade names, consists of a cone-shaped piece of metal coated with fluorescent material (the target). Electrons emitted from a cathode impinge on this target and cause it to glow wdth a green colour over more or less of its surface. Two or more small rods act as grids and when their voltage is altered a shadow moves, opening and closing on the target. A small triode is also mounted within the bulb in order to amplify the voltage applied to the grid rods, i.e., improve the sensitivity. The grid of the triode is normally connected to the A.V.C. line in the receiver, with the result that the 'eye” opens and closes in accordance with the tuning of the receiver. Connections for Triple Twin Valve. (2) Transmitting Valves Under the classification of transmitting valves those used solely for R.F. circuits will be considered. The types of transmitting valves in general use are : Triodes, screen grid and pentodes. The use ofA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 29 electronic oscillators and magnetron valves is con fined to ultra-high frequencies (56 Me or greater) and does not come within the scope of this chapter. Transmitting Triodes range in size from small receiving battery valves for very low power circuits to water-cooled valves for high power. As a rule the valves have dull-emitter filaments up to a power of 250 watts, and above that figure bright-emitter tungsten filaments. Indirectly heated cathode valves are not generally used except for crystal oscillators or master oscillators, and even then their application is limited. In general, valves are chosen which do not have an exceptionallv high mutual conductance, a usual figure being between 1 and 4 mA/V., and have a medium impedance, say, between 3,000 and 25,000 ohms. The reasons being that a high mutual conductance valve presents difficulty in neutralising, and very low or high impedances result in low efficiencies, in the former due to awkward L.C. ratios of tuning circuits, and the latter due to the difficulty of getting a short-wave tuning circuit with a high dynamic resistance and at the same time giving adequate selectivity to reduce harmonics. Valves designed especially for short-wave work as a rule have the grid or anode, or both, brought out through the top or side of the bulb, and more often than not no base at all is provided, the object being to reduce the capacity between the electrodes and at the same time reduce the possibility of leakage or breakdown at high voltage—likely with the more usual type of pinch (where the lead-out wires are bunched together in the glass near the base). In the case of valves especi ally designed for use on ultra- short waves the anode is often made of graphite in the form of a hollow block. Anodes of this type are capable of dissi pating more energy with less chance of gas being driven off. These triodes can be used quite satisfactorily on a wave length of 2-5 metres. Recently a new transmitting valve has been designed known as the Transmitting Acorn. This valve is built on the same lines as the receiving _ Acorn but of somewhat larger dimensions. It is capable of dissipating 30 watts on the anode and will operate at frequencies up to 600 Me, giving an output of 8 • 5 watts at 300 Me and 4 watts at 600 Me. An illustration of one of these valves accompanies this chapter. . . Screen grid and Pentodes in the receiving types are largely utilised as crystal oscillators, master oscillators either of the dynatron or electron coupled type, and as Tri-Tet oscillators or frequency doublers. For the latter the output pentode type are very useful. For higher power circuits screen-grid valves and R.F. pentodes are obtainable, the former in sizes up to 250 watts and the latter up to 100 watts. A screen- grid or R.F. pentode gives somewhat higher am plification and the vital necessity for neutralisation is removed although it is advised as a precaution against the possibility of self-oscillation. The greatest advantage of their use as a Power Amplifier at high frequencies is that due to their high amplification factor, the amount of drive from the previous stage is quite small, and at very high frequencies, 28 and 56 Me, a considerable drive is difficult to obtain. The Beam valves referred to earlier in the chapter are also used extensively for transmitting purposes. They make extraordinarily efficient Tri- Tet oscillators and frequency-doublers even as high as the 56 Me band where as a 28-56 Me doubler outputs in the order of 10 watts are obtainable. They have in fact been described as the valve that makes 56 Me crystal control possible. The R.F. pentodes can be modulated by varia tions of the suppressor grid potential, and this variation can be supplied by a small receiving valve, effecting a great economy in speech frequency equipment. The valves produced at present are not very suitable for use on ultra-short waves. (3) Rectifier Valves Rectifiers fall into two classes : Vacuum diodes and vapour-filled diodes. The vacuum type may be either directly or in directly heated and are usually full-wave for small valves and half-wave in larger sizes. The indirectly heated type have the advantage that they heat up slowly and, in consequence, allow the other valves in the receiver or amplifier to get hot before the H.T. voltage is applied, giving an appreciable saving in the breakdown voltage of smoothing condensers required. The maximum power obtainable from the indirectly heated type is 500-600 volts at 250 mA full wave. The directly heated type range from 250 volts 60 mA up to water-cooled type giving 20,000 volts and several amps. The vapour-filled type are invariably directly heated, having a filament in the form of a spiral or zigzag,’ and flat or concave plate for an anode, the BEAM VALVE.

Comparative characteristic curves of Beam and Pentode Valves.CHAPTER FOUR Transmitter Design Valve Opera! ion—Oscillators—Doublers—Power Amplifiers Practical Circuits T HIS chapter deals with the generation of stable oscillatory power for the aerial, whilst Chapter 5 will deal with the means of imposing the message on this “ carrier ” power. Some of the fundamental principles and definitions have already been given in Chapter 2, which should therefore be studied first. However, for convenience, reference is made herein to one or two of the figures used in that chapter. Requirements The function of a transmitter is to supply power to an aerial at a definite frequency ; it must also be possible to convey intelligence by means of the signal radiated. There are two ways of performing the latter function, first by breaking up the signals to the dots and dashes of the morse code ; second, by modulating the signals with speech. The first requirement is a generator of oscilla tions of a definite frequency ; the valve has now practically superseded all other methods of genera tion and is the only method we shall consider. The oscillations generated must be of the correct fre quency and must be stable, as will be seen later. Short-wave work calls for very stringent control of the frequency and stability. A plain valve oscillator coupled to the aerial is quite unsuitable; consequently, more complicated transmitters involv ing at least two stages are necessary. The amateur frequency channels have a convenient harmonic relation, that is to say, frequencies in the 3-5 Me band can be multiplied by two to give frequencies within the 7 Me band, and so on right through the six normally allotted bands. This makes possible the type of design in which special valve circuits can be arranged to double the fre quency originally generated, with the result that a complete transmitter can be built in which R.F. output on all the amateur bands can be picked off from the various multiples of the original master frequency. In general, then, amateur transmitters will fall into one of two classes :— (a) The master oscillator and amplifier. (b) The master oscillator and harmonic amplifier, according to whether it is desired to work on one band or several harmonically related. Fundamental Valve Operation The valve being the most fundamental part of the transmitter, it will be well to consider here briefly its operating conditions and behaviour. Trans mitting valves differ considerably from receiving valves, both in design and operation. In a receiver they are usually required to deal with very small oscillations, and even an output power valve only runs at poor efficiency. In a transmitter, all the valves are, generally speaking, power valves, and due to the need for high efficiency are run at “ full steam.” This imposes special requirements on such valves. It has already been shown that if we apply normal voltages to a valve, and place a suitable impedance in its anode circuit, then by applying an oscillating voltage to the grid an amplified voltage can be obtained across the applied impe dance or anode load. Thus in Fig. 1A, R repre sents a resistance connected in series with the high tension supply and the anode, whilst an oscillation is applied to the grid, together with bias from a small battery. The grid oscillations cause variations in the plate current which, passing through R, develop an oscillatory voltage drop across it. H T + Fig. 1. Fundamental valve amplifier circuit. Now in the ordinary receiver circuit it is required that the anode voltage shall be a faithful reproduc tion of the original grid oscillation, which means that the anode current must be strictly proportional to the grid voltage, in other words, the grid volts, anode current curves must be straight. An inspec tion of almost any such curve will show that in general it is straight only over a small range, so that for fidelity we can only use a limited portion of the available current. Fig. 11, Chapter 2, represents such a curve and shows the grid oscillation along the centre of the grid base, and the corresponding anode current variation to the right. Obviously, if the grid swing is too great the bottom part of the anode current curve will be flattened off. Alternatively, it is 3132 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO not possible to put the steady position further up the curve towards zero bias, because then the oscillation would swing the grid positive with respect to the cathode and a similar form of dis tortion would occur, due to the fact that in this region the grid acts like an anode and passes a current which damps the driving source. The power in the oscillation is thus a small proportion of the steady power supplied (D.C. volts X mean anode current) and the efficiency is small. Various means have been devised to improve matters, but the best result so far is still low efficiency or high distortion. In a high-frequency transmitter the valve is only concerned with one frequency, or very nearly so, and we can thus place a tuned circuit in the ancde instead of the usual resistance or transformer as used in audio amplification. Fig. IB shows a valve with a tuned anode output circuit. Pulse Operation: Harmonics The distortion which occurs when the grid of a valve is swung too hard is often serious. The flattening of the crests of the oscillations is equivalent to the introduction of new frequencies which are integral multiples of the original, and these multiples are called “ harmonics.” The qualities of a musical instrument depend upon the proportions of har monics it generates, and if in reproducing them, this is altered by the introduction of new ones, the instrument sounds false. In the detector stage of a receiver this distortion is used, and with proper control on the type of distortion applied to the R.F. oscillation, it can be made to deliver up its modulation as audio without secondary distortion of this latter. In the R.F. amplifier we can tune the anode circuit to the desired frequency and it will select only that frequency, so that the distortion does not matter. It is thus possible to apply larger oscilla tions or drive to the grid, and so swing the anode current much harder. This means that much more power is available in the anode circuit for the same steady input and hence greater efficiency is achieved. The parallel tuned circuit in the anode is equiva lent to a high resistance load (its dynamic impe dance) at the fundamental frequency. The anode current oscillation develops an oscillatory voltage across the parallel circuit, and there is an oscillating current flowing round the coil and condenser of much greater magnitude. At the harmonic fre quencies, the circuit is out of resonance, and having low parallel impedance does not develop much harmonic power. The power available may be taken out into a load circuit by direct connection to the anode, by tapping on to the coil, or by magnetic coupling to another circuit, as shown in Fig. IB. The effect of this extra circuit is to reduce the dynamic impedance of the anode circuit to a lower effective resistance. There is an optimum value of impedance for each valve and for each operating condition, which may be found by adjusting taps or couplings. Obviously, the anode coil and condenser employed must be electrically good, otherwise they will represent part of the load and will thereby take some of the power. With no restriction on valve distortion, efficiency can be much higher than in the straight amplifier. By making use of grid distortion as well, very high efficiency is obtainable. Nearly all R.F. power amplifiers are now operated in this manner. The modern method of adjustment is as follows :— Referring to Fig. 2 the bias is increased to “ cutoff ” at the left. The drive now causes the anode to conduct pulses, as shown in the lower curve at the right. It is increased till the grid is swung as far beyond positive as it can be made to go, and the anode pulses become high. The tuned circuit of Fig. IB now receives a succession of kicks, and if it is tuned to their frequency large oscillations will be maintained in this closed or 'tank” circuit, the power being taken from the valve to make up the loss due to the coil resistance and the load. The amplitude of the anode swing is determined by the size of the pulse ; the fundamental output is represented by the dotted wave. The second harmonic (twice fundamental frequency) will be of smaller amplitude but can be selected, if desired, as an alternative. The D.C. input, represented by the horizontal line, is about one-third or less the peak of the pulse, and is fixed by the average of the pulse. The efficiency, therefore, is highest when the pulses are high and narrow. They may be narrowed by in creasing the bias still further and increasing the drive to suit, and it is usual to bias to at least twice cutoff, provided enough drive is available. It is to be noted that these increases of efficiency are obtained at the expense of input, and not by increasing output for the same input. To get greater output at the higher efficiency the anode swing must be increased still further. There are two ways of doing this :■—-Firstly, by increasing the drive. This will not help very much because if we drive the grid too far positive, grid current will be excessive and the drive will be held back. Secondly, by increasing H.T. volts and at the same time increasing both bias and drive. The limit to this process is set by the power lost which goes towards heating the anode of the valve. Valves with white molybdenum anodes may safely dissipate enough power to heat the anode red, though it is not recommended for continuous operation. Valves with dull (nickel) or black carbonised anodes should never be run even visibly hot. Such over running is liable to liberate gas from the electrodesA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 33 which may quite suddenly destroy the vacuum and ruin the valve. Another limit is set by the excessive R.F. voltage which may be generated, which heats and eventually cracks the seals. Most transmitting valves are designed to operate with grid current flowing. Receiving tubes, except Class B types, will often not operate in this way without developing trouble. Finally, if the valve is to operate at high efficiency it must have sufficient cathode emission to allow it to pass heavy pulses. In a valve passing a steady plate current of 50 mA, the pulses may be required to reach ten times that value, though it is impossible to obtain such a current under direct current test conditions. The filament therefore should never be underrun, for starving the pulses will result in excessive anode heating. Driving Power. The oscillation required for driving the grid represents power. The grid current which flows every time the grid becomes positive represents a power loss to be supplied by the driving agency. It may be estimated roughly by taking the PR value for the grid current I flowing through the gridleak R. In a triode amplifier stage, the power output available can be 5 to 10 times the power required for driving. In pentodes much better ratios (50 to 100) are obtained. The driving power may be obtained by “ borrow ing ” some of the output of the anode circuit, in which case we have a self-oscillator, or it may be derived from the output of a previous stage, in which case we have a power amplifier. Regarding the efficiency obtainable in practice with a power amplifier, 60 per cent, is a very good figure for 14 Me, whilst 90 per cent, can be obtained at lower frequencies. For estimating purposes, however, 50 per cent, is a good value to use. At frequencies above 14 Me efficiencies drop, and it is advisable to run normal valves at low rating or use valves specially designed for the purpose. Transmitting valves, particularly modern ones, should never be run beyond the makers’ rating - they can afford to find the bursting point, maybe you cannot ! Oscillator Circuits Having discussed how the valve can be made an efficient R.F. amplifier, let us now consider how we can make it act as a generator by feeding back some of its output in order to excite the grid. Such a generator is called a self-excited oscillator. The easiest method is to connect a coil between grid and cathode, and couple it magnetically to the anode as shown in Fig. 3. Referring to Fig. 1, if the grid is made more positive, that is nearer zero bias, then the anode current increases. The increased current through the load results in increased voltage drop across it, and since the H.T. end is at a steady voltage, the voltage at the anode must drop. Thus if an oscillation is applied to the grid, then the anode voltage swings in opposite sense, i.e. opposite phase. The same applies of course whether we use a re sistance or a circuit tuned to the frequency of the oscillations. In a self-oscillator therefore it is essential that the two coils Lj and T 2 should be connected in the correct direction. In Fig. 3, if the coils are wound in the same direction and connected as shown on plan, then the grid voltage will be of the correct phase. The process is exactly the same as in the regenerative detector of a receiver, except that the anode is tuned, as we desire to take power from it. The voltage applied to the grid must be sufficient to give a pulse large enough to make up the power lost in the last cycle of oscillation in the anode circuit, due to its resistance, or by that taken by any output circuit. The coupling between the coils is increased, until sufficient grid voltage is obtained. The oscillations always start themselves, as any disturb ance in the circuit, however minute, builds up as in a reaction circuit. Now, returning to the pulse theory, it is essential for efficiency that bias be used. This may be applied from a battery, but it is easier to use a condenser and leak C 2 and R. Each time the grid swings on the positive side of zero bias a pulse of current will flow from it : C 2 will average out these pulses into a steady discharge flowing away down R, to Fig. 3. Fundamental oscillator circuit. produce the required bias across it. The value of R is important. If it is too low there will be not enough bias, if it is too high then the charge in C 2 will leak away too slowly, at an audible rate in fact, in which case grid howling will set in and the output of the oscillator instead of being pure R.F. will be badly chopped at this howling or “ tquegger ” frequency. A suitable value to try for R is 10,000 ohms, but the best value should be found by experiment. C 2 at R.F. should be between 100 and 1,000 p.[i.F. The efficiency of a self-oscillator can never be the same as with separate excitation, first because part of the output is used in the drive and second because it is not possible to drive so hard. The Hartley Oscillator The reversed feedback circuit just described is one of a large group of oscillators which use in ductive coupling for the feedback. There is another class in which feedback is obtained by capacity, and nearly all oscillators can be placed in one class or the other. The Hartley oscillator is the best known of the inductive types and is the easiest to adjust. Fig. 434 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO shows how it is derived from an oscillating detector circuit. In the final circuit the tuning condenser is placed across the whole coil, as this usually produces the best oscillating conditions. Notice that the choke feeding the anode is now across an active part of the circuit and should therefore be of good quality and suitable for the frequencies it must reject. For this reason the circuit is known as “ shunt fed.” rt.F.C. Fig. 4. Derivation of the Hartley oscillator from a reacting detector circuit, by simple rearrangement. In Fig. 5 the coil is broken and the H.T. supplied at the ” earthy ” or ‘‘ cold ” point where there is no R.F. potential. The choke is now less important, and any choke of average quality can be used, or even a resistance. The oscillating circuit is closed by a condenser which must be large enough to have a low impedance ; -01 pF mica is suitable ; paper condensers should never be used in closed circuits as they introduce more resistance than mica types. Hitherto the illustrations have shown filament type cathodes in the valves, with battery supply, but in later figures a simple cathode only will be shown, and unless specially noted the cathode may be either directly or indirectly heated. The T.P.T.G. (Tuned Plate-Tuned Grid) Fig. 6 shows the circuit with capacitative feedback, the actual capacity used being that between the grid and plate electrodes of the valve, as illustrated in the lower skeleton diagram. When the grid and plate are tuned to nearly the same frequency, oscillations start, but for maximum efficiency these circuits should be slightly out of tune with one another. This oscillator is not so easy to adjust but is very popular because better stability is obtained than with most other circuits in this group. The series-fed Hartley, in which the loss from the choke in shunt with the anode circuit is removed by feeding at an “ earthy ” point. In Fig. 6 the grid condenser and leak are shown connected at the “ earthy ” end of the tuned circuit ; this is not essential, but is sometimes convenient in transmitter circuits. Stability and “ Note ” The stability demanded by H.F. operation is very great. The bands authorised for amateur transmission are very narrow, and it is absolutely essential to keep the frequency from moving outside and causing interference with commercial signals. For this reason, before any attempt is made to adjust a transmitter, means should be available for checking frequency. The best way is to use a monitoring receiver, preferably entirely screened Fig. 6. The T.P.T.G. circuit, with skeleton circuit below showing the feedback via anode grid capacity.A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 35 (batteries and all), which can be accurately calibrated by reference to the known and published frequencies of certain stations near the bands, such as the British commercial stations, and by cross-reference to a quartz-crystal oscillator. Further, the oscillation must be so steady that during communication it does not move out of audible beat in the receiver tuned to it at a distant station. This means ± 5 kc, which in the 14 Me band amounts to one part in 3,000, a high order of stability. With improving receiver design, the demand becomes progressively more critical. The frequency is determined fundamentally by the tuned circuit Lj Q (Fig. 3) being such that the reactance of Lj and C x are equal but opposite ; the reactance around the closed circuit is then zero, and the oscillator chooses the frequency which gives this condition. Unfortunately, many things tend to upset the reactances of the circuits. For example, the valve is connected and the capacity of its electrodes must therefore be included. As the valve heats up this latter will change and the frequency with it. If the oscillator valve is to be keyed by breaking its supplies, the frequency may wander each time the key is closed and the electrodes cool again when it is opened. This would cause chirpy signals to be heard in the receiver. The damping effect of the valve and its grid load also have an effect which makes the frequency dependent upon the voltage of the H.T. supply, etc. The ripple from a badly smoothed mains H.T. supply would cause the R.F. to “ wobble,' producing frequency modulation, and this at the receiver end is likely to sound very heavily modu lated or broad in tuning, causing interference with other signals. From the same cause too large a value of C 2 or R would cause a “ chirp ” owing to the finite time required to establish steady bias. Further the output circuit throws capacity into the closed circuit, and if this has loose connections or is unstable (e.g. a swinging aerial) then instability so great may arise that the signal is unreadable. For these reasons it is extremely difficult to make a reliable transmitter from a plain oscillator coupled to an aerial, and such an arrangement is never to be recommended. ' High C ” Most of the above troubles can be cured by making Ci large (say 200 ppF at least) and L correspondingly small to suit; there is of course a maximum beyond which oscillation is not obtainable. With Q large the variable external circuits have correspondingly less effect. Some oscillator circuits, especially the ' Dow ” and “ Tritet ” described later, actually require high C for proper working, and so automatically help in this way. An important aid towards stability is the use of very low-loss circuits; looser coupling may then be employed and the circuit left in a cleaner state. With High Q circuits, the condition of zero re actance is more critically dependent on frequency. The choke CH and condenser C 3 in Fig. 3 are for the purpose of preventing the R.F. current from passing into the battery, or power supply, another common cause of impurity in the oscillation. Separation of the R.F. components into their proper channels should always be attended to. Oscillator Adjustments Various apparatus is essential for the adjustment of an oscillator. A feed-meter, a receiving monitor, and absorption wavemeter, also some form of output indicator or artificial aerial, are essential. Some of these devices are described in other chapters. The beginner will be advised to carry out experi ments with simple oscillators, and these indicating devices, in order to learn how the circuits behave; this experience will of course be invaluable later. Initial experiments may be made with ordinary audio power valves working on low power. A feed-meter, say 50 mA full-scale, should be included in the H.T. supply as in Fig. 6. For monitoring purposes various schemes are available, but the best is a completely screened oscillating detector. Other arrangements include listening to a harmonic on an ordinary oscillating receiver (e.g. down to 14 Me if the oscillator is on 3 -5) ; this is a particularly useful method for stability adjust ments as any variations are multiplied. The absorption wavemeter consists of a variable condenser of about 100 ppF capacity, arranged in any convenient manner to take plug-in coils. It can be calibrated by means of an oscillating receiver, beating with known stations. With very loose coupling the beat note is heard to change sharp’y as the wavemeter condenser is tuned ; the centre of tins change of note is the resonant fre quency. There will at the same time be a change in the feed current to the oscillator. Such a wave meter is not suitable for accurate work, but is invaluable for general adjustments, as it is a fool proof method of adjusting circuits to roughly the correct frequency ; e.g. in a frequency-multiplying stage the exact harmonic can be found easily, though it is very difficult with monitoring methods. (See Chapter 9.) For an artificial aerial or load the instrument described in Chapter 13 may be used, or a low voltage lamp may be connected in series with the wavemeter, the wattage being chosen to suit. Starting with a small H.T. supply, oscillation is indicated by a sharp fall in anode current showing arrival of bias from grid current. If it rises at the commencement of oscillation, then the gridleak is far too low. With any oscillator using more than about 250 volts H.T. supply, it should be possible to light a neon lamp held near the anode connection, whilst a small loop closed by a pea-lamp can be coupled to form another type of indicator. The frequency may be checked roughly by coupling the absorption wave-meter loosely and tuning it for maximum ' pull ” of the feed. Such a check is not in itself sufficiently accurate for ensuring that the frequency is within the amateur bands, as they themselves are only a few kilocycles wide. It may be necessary to adjust taps, coils, etc., before oscillation is obtained, and in the T.P.T.G. case, of course, the tuning. Taps, couplings and gridleaks are all adjusted for maximum output in the load, consistent with stability. Note that as the coupling of the load is increased the power output rises to a maximum and then drops back with tight or overcoupling, whilst the feed rises continuously until oscillation ceases. This Optimum point should never be exceeded in any part of a trans mitter, as it invariably leads to instability and a bad note ; it is always better to be a little under coupled.36 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO It should be possible to key the oscillator without bad chirp. If a mains power supply is used it may be difficult to produce a perfectly clean note especially on the higher frequencies. It is not usually an easy matter to run a directly heated filament from A.C. supply, as the ripple on the frequency is often bad. If the oscillator shows abnormal effects, such as sudden changes of feed when tuned, or overheating with low inputs, it may be suffering from parasitic oscillations. These are dealt with later. Crystal Control Quartz is endowed with certain physical properties which make it valuable for the control of trans mitters, and its adoption is now almost universal. Its mechanical properties are such that the natural vibration of a thin slice 1 mm. thick, correctly cut, is of the order of 3 Me, and the internal damping is so minute that it is equivalent to a circuit of extremely sharp resonance, much sharper than any device employing coils and condensers, as we know them. Thus, if a slice of quartz is placed between flat electrodes, it can replace the grid circuit of a T.P.T.G. when an oscillator of great stability results. The frequency of the oscillation is adjusted by grinding to a definite thickness: skill is needed for this operation as results depend on the accuracy with which the faces are ground flat and parallel. Quartz crystals may be ground to as high a frequency as 3-5 Me with success, but above this figure the power capacity drops and the grinding becomes more critical. A crystal frequently used employs a 2-4 Me cut. When connected to a valve with a 7 Me anode circuit such a crystal will drive from its third harmonic with good output. These are known as “ thick-cut ” crystals. Fig. 7 shows such a circuit using a triode. In operation, tuning the anode condenser C from maxi mum downwards, a sharp drop in current occurs at some point and the crystal is then oscillating at maximum output. Continuing towards zero capacity, the feed rises and the output drops. It is best in practice to work slightly below maximum output, otherwise stability is slightly impaired, and starting up is not quite so certain. Stability is such that the frequency can be specified to within 1 cycle per 10,000, using fairly good quartz, provided it is not overrun, although it is advisable to check occasionally as poor samples have been known to vary badly and move the transmission out of the allotted amateur bands. As with other circuits the frequency depends slightly on temperature. Overrunning causes heating of the quartz with consequent frequency drift, which may be sufficient to cause a distant receiving station to lose the signals. Again, excessive vibration is liable to crack or ruin the crystal. The input to the oscillator should therefore be limited to about 5 watts, or perhaps a little more. It is a good plan to insert in the “ earthy ” lead to the crystal a pea-lamp which glows at 50 mA, and never exceed this current for any length of time. For a triode crystal oscillator, a suitable valve is the LS5B ; the H.T. should not exceed three to four hundred volts, especially if the crystal is a good one. A.C. heating may be used with centre-tap connection as shown in Fig. 7, the “ centre-tap ” condensers being of the order of •Olp.F. The choke and condenser Q are for ' cleaning ” the R.F. out of the power supply. It is not usual to employ this type of crystal oscillator connected directly to the aerial because the oscillations starting and stopping would produce a chirpy effect. Also, only a small power may be handled by a crystal stage and for high power this must be amplified by additional stages. Fig. 7. Triode crystal oscillator. Note also a method of feeding a directly heated cathode from A.C. A pentode valve makes an excellent oscillator when used with a quartz crystal, and much higher outputs may be obtained for the same amount of crystal heating. Triode valves cause more crystal heating than pentodes for the same input power, and pentodes are becoming universally popular for this work. Fig. 8 shows a good circuit for a pentode crystal-oscillator. The screen voltage should be kept fairly low even though the plate voltage is increased to more than normal ; it is found that using more than a minimum screen voltage the input current is increased without a corresponding increase of high-frequency output, and it is usual tp use an adjustable potentiometer for this purpose. Fig. 8. Pentode crystal oscillator circuit. The suppressor Is shown joined internally to cathode, but if accessible it should be earthed. Cl C 3 are bypass condensers and R., drops the screen to about 100 volts. This type of valve can be keyed with hardly any appreciable lag in the crystal, and for this reason it makes an excellent low power transmitter circuit. Other Oscillators There are a number of other oscillator circuits of secondary interest, some of which are illustrated in Fig. 9. The first, the Colpitts, is similar to theA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 37 Hartley, but the tap is made between two condensers ^ p instead of on the coil : it is useful where harmonic '' output must be minimised. A variety, useful on ultra-short waves, uses the grid-plate and grid- cathode capacities for the Colpitts tap, and is called the “ Ultraudion.” A variety of the TPTG is known as the “ TNT ” (Tuned-not-tuned), the grid coil being made so large as to tune with the valve and stray capacities only. Its advantage is that it is simple to tune over a small range of frequencies. Fig. 9. The “Colpitts,” “Ultraudion ” and “TNT ” Oscillators. Electron-Stream Coupling A very important self-excited arrangement is known as the Dow, or electron-coupled oscillator. In this type the load circuit is shielded from the frequency-determining circuits so that variations of load cause very little change of frequency. Varia tions of supply voltage also affect the frequency but little, and the E.C. oscillator is therefore an excellent generator of stable frequency, whether this is required for metering, monitoring, or transmitter excitation. Fig. 10 shows the evolution of an E.C.circuit from a simple triode Hartley oscillator. In the Hartley (A) the cathode or cathode tap is at steady or earth potential, although it is not essential for its working that this be the earthy point of the circuit. As long as the plate, grid, and filament have the proper relative potentials any one of the three may be made the earth point. The second diagram shows how the plate may be held at earth potential with regard to H.F. though still at a high D.C. potential above earth ; the fixed condenser has a negligible reactance to H.F. and holds the plate to earth, or zero potential. The circuit is most suitable for valves with separately heated cathodes ; if a directly heated filament is used it is necessary to feed this through chokes or else wind the coil double from the bottom to the tap and supply the filament current through this pair. The complication which this involves tends to make the correct adjustment difficult. In modern, indirectly heated valves the insulation between cathode and heater is usually sufficiently good for the small R.F. potential developed across the tap. The third diagram (C) shows the substitution of a tetrode, which is intended to be a screen-grid type. The screening grid has been “ borrowed ” to make the anode of the inverted triode circuit (B), and if the anode of (C) is covered up the circuit (B) will be recognised. The real plate of the tetrode, if given a positive D.C. potential, will receive the electrons passing Fig. 10. The “ Dow ” or electron-coupled oscillator (ECO), derived from a Hartley. This combines the functions of oscillator and buffer or frequency mutlipller.38 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO through the screening grid. The electron stream passing through the screening grid will be modulated by the oscillations set up in the Hartley circuit, and therefore the plate current of the tetrode will have an H.F. component. A tuned circuit connected in series with the anode, shown coupled to the load, can extract power from the modulated anode current, which incidentally consists of quite good pulses, and this can be coupled to the aerial or used to drive another valve. If the screening is good and there is no other coupling between the two tuned circuits, the tuning of the anode or load circuit can have little effect on the frequency generated. To keep the frequency constant with small changes of H.T. voltage, and to allow of optimum output power adjustment, the screen grid is fed from a potentio meter across the plate source, as shown. An oscillator of this type is capable of producing signals of stability and character equal to crystal- controlled oscillators, but, as with all self-excited oscillators, care must be taken to have rigid con struction and to avoid all vibration, not to mention careful frequency measurement to ensure that the frequency is ' inside the band.” The E.C. oscillator is very rich in harmonics, and if the output circuit is tuned to twice the generated frequency the output will be almost as great as on the fundamental frequency. Third and fourth harmonics are also strong, so care should be taken in identify ing the harmonic obtained. Thus the valve may combine the functions of oscillator and doubler. Heating of the valve and the warming up of the compartment in which it may be contained will produce some frequency drift; to minimise such changes the valve heater should be switched on some time before use, and kept connected during the period of working. Pentodes are not suitable for this circuit unless the third or suppressor grid is brought out to a separate connection so that it can be earthed or joined to screen, the latter being preferable. The Tritet A very popular circuit, giving good flexibility with great output, is shown in Fig. 11. It is called the ' Tritet ” because it combines a triode crystal oscillator with a tetrode buffer-doubler in one valve. Fig. 11. The “ Tritet ” oscillator, a type of E.C.O. When a pentode is used it is preferable to connect it as a tetrode. Note the pea-lamp crystal overload warning. It is of the TPTG type, though the feedback capacity is not obvious, being actually the capacity between grid and earth. It is shown with the screen and suppressor grids connected, though in many pentodes this cannot be done as the suppressor is not brought out but connected to cathode inside the bulb. The former (or tetrode) connection gives better output and is more stable. The circuit is also seen to be of the ' electron-coupled ” type. C 4 must be large enough to pass the harmonic frequencies easily, these being delivered to the anode tank circuit CL. CL cannot be tuned to the fundamental of the crystal as the two circuits will then oscillate of their own and overload the crystal. Similarly, on no account must the cathode circuit be tuned as low as the second harmonic, and it is advisable to make sure of thia by shunting C 4 with a good quality 100 p.p,F conden ser, and choosing L 2 to tune the crystal with about 200 ^p.F ; no more output is obtained by increasing L 2 , and a heavy crystal current will result ; therefore a pea-lamp or some indicator of crystal current is essential. From the anode, using an ordinary output size pentode with 300 volts on the anode and 100 on the screen, 2 watts of second harmonic output can be obtained as well as quite a deal of third or fourth harmonic. When it is desired to take out the funda mental, the coil L 2 is shorted and the anode coil tuned up, the circuit then becoming the ordinary pentode C.O. The screen potentiometer shown may be used or any other kind of adjusting device, but the screen voltage must not be allowed to rise much above 100 volts. C L and C 3 are of course essential. It is a good plan to connect a jack in series with the leak R to take a grid current meter. To place the circuit in operation tune C 4 from maximum downwards, oscillation being indicated by a drop in plate current. Now tune the anode circuit for a sharp minimum feed, and use the absorption wavemeter to check that the correct harmonic has been chosen. Set C 4 some way short of maximum out put. The circuit may be keyed in the anode supply, leaving the supply on the screen and the crystal oscillating, though the adjustment for note may not be easy. Keying the screen supply may be attemp ted, though a chirp is almost certain to result. In adjusting E.C.O. or tritet generators, it is often found that a better note, i.e., purer, or less chirp on. keying, is obtained if the anode circuit is detuned slightly to one side or the other. The output from a tritet will drive a small PA stage on three bands ; such an arrangement makes a very compact three-band transmitter. Frequency Multipliers If an anode circuit is tuned to a multiple of the driving frequency, say the third, then it will receive a kick at every third cycle of oscillation, and pro vided it is not too heavily loaded the pulse will maintain oscillations at three times drive frequency. Frequency multiplication has already been men tioned, though a new way of discussing its operation is here introduced. The efficiency of such an amplifier is governed by the same considerations as before ; namely, hard driving and high narrow pulses, but note now that one pulse has to supply several oscillations in the anode tank, and so the efficiency becomes progressively lower as the multiple increases.A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 39 Only precision instruments enable you to test accurately and trace radio faults efficiently. “ AVO ” Instruments are outstanding for precision.

MUIRHEAD &amp; CO. LTD. ELMERS END (Tel. Bee. 0041 2) KENT■■HMIVMHHPPI RADIO 41 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR The advantages of doublers and the like have ✓ already been mentioned. The same master oscilla- ^ tor can be used to control the frequency on several multiple frequencies. The amateur bands, though not completely harmonically related, are never theless of such frequencies that one crystal can be arranged to control frequencies in all bands. Fourth harmonics can be obtained direct in one stage, though where it is desired to work on the 4th or 8th, it is more usual to employ a chain of doublers. With the advent of the modern H.F. transmitting pentode with its enormous power gain from grid to output, it is now practicable to design a “Drive Unit ” containing all the multiplier circuits in one unit with the crystal oscillator, all working at low power. Descriptions of such units giving one or two watts output on any band have frequently been published. Such units usually employ small pentodes, as these are better than triodes, and often make the fourth harmonic production sufficiently good for practical use. The circuit of a frequency multiplier may look the same as that of a straight amplifier, but the anode circuit is tuned to a multiple of the grid frequency. Neutralisation is not essential, though it sometimes helps to improve the note. The efficiency is often less than that of a straight amplifier even for mere doubling ; in a single valve multiplier the pulse of current contains only a proportion of harmonic, for example only 30 per cent, second and progressively less for higher multiples. Again, the energy supplied by one pulse has to feed the load for a number of cycles instead of only one. Also the anode circuit must not seriously impede the fundamental component of the pulse or it becomes distorted in such a way as to lose some of its harmonic content, a condition usually incompatible with high efficiency at the multiple frequency. during the other half cycle ; the anode thus receives twice as many pulses as either grid. Under driven con ditions, the resistance R provides extra bias in addition to the fixed bias. These difficulties can be overcome to some extent by using two valves in a ' push-push ” circuit, such as that shown in Fig. 12. This will give all even multiples but not odd ones. In doubling, the anode circuit receives pulses alternately from one or other valve and so the efficiency can approach that of a straight amplifier stage. The fundamental com ponent merely oscillates between the two valves and does not require to flow through the anode tuned circuit. An interesting variation of this uses a “ Class B ' twin valve with two triodes in one bulb and a common cathode connection. This will be seen in V 4 of Fig. 13. The grid bias conditions of a multiplier are similar to those of a P.A. stage, and there are a number of ways of obtaining supplies. These will be discussed under P.A. stages. Of the triodes the LS5B is one of the best doublers in the 10-watt class, though pentodes are often more efficient because they are easier to drive and the fundamental has a means of escape through the screen grid. For this reason they are more popular. There are a number of American pentodes specially designed for P.A. or multiplier work at R.F. though the number of British valves of this type is at present small. Of these the ' 362 ” type RFP15 is an example suitable for E.C. oscillators, doublers or low-power amplifiers. With pentodes, the screen potential is fed through a small resistance or choke and the R.F. component bypassed through a condenser to an earthy point in the usual way, and as with E.C.O. or tritet, it is often advisable to arrange for adjustable screen voltage. When the suppressor is accessible it is often found better to connect it to screen and make the valve into a tetrode for multiplying. Whilst discussing oscillators, the question of the L/C ratio was mentioned, and it was shown that for stability in a self-excited oscillator high C was desirable, but now that the frequency is deter mined and fixed, we can choose the sizes in the doubler and amplifier stages in terms of efficiency only. For driving purposes volts are required, and to obtain the maximum for a given input wattage high L and low C are required. Having found a size of coil to start with, it may be increased till the valve input capacity represents practically all the tuning capacity. On the anode side a rather high impedance is required to suit the valve, but this must all be due to load and not to internal loss of the coil. This again leads to a high L/C ratio. There is a limit, but it is not usually attained on short waves. The adjustment of a doubler is a simple process. First with reduced H.T. voltage, the drive is applied; the coupling being adjusted for optimum at reson ance (the feed rise or grid current is taken as an indication). Tuning the anode circuit then pro duces a sharp minimum current at its resonance, and this should be fairly low, say one-third of the maximum. If this is not the case, or the tuning is flat, then there is loss in the circuit which may be due to dirty connections, a bad coil former, or dust in the condenser, including bad insulation. There may also be trouble in the decoupling or feed circuits. Power Amplifiers The first practical considerations in the final or P.A. stage are the circuit and the valves to be used. Generally there is the choice between “ push-pull ” and “ single ended ” ; the advantages and disadvantages about balance, and the deciding factor is often the valves available for the power to be used. Bearing in mind that triodes are sometimes cheaper, a 10-watt station might use a single triode such as the LS5 or LS5B. For 25 watts a42 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO pair could be used in push-pull, or a single ended pentode or triode of the 25-watt class, such as the Mullard T25D (triode) or the “ 362 RFPlo pentode. For more than 25 watts the matter of drive becomes important, especially if triodes are used. As with doublers, best drive is obtained with high inductance, and high anode inductance helps the efficiency. , . ,, A P.A. stage has its grid and anode tuned to the same frequency and therefore it is necessary to see that there is no feed-back from anode to gnd, either magnetically or by grid-anode capacity. The result of this is either self-oscillation or at least a bad note which is liable to occupy a wide frequency range and cause unnecessary interference. With pentodes designed so as to be properly screened between grid and anode, all that is necessary is to avoid coupling outside the valve. dials. With hard drive there may be a slight “dimple” in the peak of grid current, but this should -r- fit in with the tuning resonances. In push-pull circuits it is necessary not only to balance the stage, but also to balance the valves to take equal loading, and for this it is best to have the grid returns separate so that individual grid currents may be observed. The two neutralising condensers should be worked together so as to be equal, until the stage is neutrahsed, after which they can be worked one against the other till the grid currents balance. Neutralising connections for push-pull are illustrated in Fig. 14. The advantage of a push-pull circuit is that once it is balanced, the settings are for practical purposes the same for all frequencies, whereas in the single ended stage it is necessary to reset each time the coils are changed to another band. Sometimes it is not possible to stabilise the P.A., Fig. 13. A transmitter lor 100 watts telegraphy or 25 watts telephony, employing a drive unit (lower) and a push-pull P.A. (upper). Note the twin-triode valves, V 3 used as an oscillator-doubler and V, as a push-push doubler. Note also the method of connecting self-closing jacks to prevent The valve is arranged to fit through a sheet of thin metal with the input circuits on one side and the output circuits on the other. This acts as an electrostatic screen. The grid coil must also be well separated from the anode coil. A good distance is five times the diameter of the anode coil. With triodes, and pentodes not designed for good internal screening, neutralisation or balancing is necessary. The process has already been described in Chapter 2, and we shall only enlarge upon it here. Rough balancing with loop circuits or neon lamps is fairly easy, but seldom sufficient to obtain a good note. The grid current method is un doubtedly the best. When the stage is correctly balanced all tunings should be independent of each other, max. drive, min. anode current, and max. grid current should all coincide on the tuning a condition for which there are many possible causes. Firstly, make sure that the neutrahsing condensers are not too small or too large. They should be of the same capacity as the grid-plate of the valve. A rough estimate of the value of the condenser can be made by examining the electrodes. If the plate is large and close to the grid a fairly high value, say up to 15[xp.F, may be needed, but in a well spaced triode the value may be as low as 3ji.p.F, and so a little care is needed to see that the minimum capacity of the condenser is not too great. There are a number of suitable condensers on the market, such as 3-15ppF. In pentodes the screen grid, by shielding, reduces the grid-plate capacity to a fraction of a pp.F, and this can usually be ignored in a transmitter, but only if the shielding is carried on outside the valve by arranging it to pass through a hole in an earthedA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 43 metal baffle and in such a way that the anode and grid components cannot “ see ” each other. If this is not done, or if the internal screening is not too good, then neutralisation will be needed, although the capacity required will probably be very small. In such cases it can be made up by arranging two small plates about an inch square with a third earthed plate to slide in between. Another method is to wind a few turns of wire on a glass tube for one plate of the condenser and use a wire sliding inside the tube for the other. An example of these latter can be seen in the illustration of the “ D.X. Three ” transmitter which appears below. They can be seen immediately above the grid tuning con densers of the push-pull P.A. valves. Parasitic Oscillation Very often trouble is caused by the valve oscillat ing at some unexpected frequency, and finding this frequency is equal to the cure. The stage may appear to be running quite well, yet the efficiency is poor and the electrodes may be overheated. To discover the unwanted frequency explore with a receiver and listen for spurious notes— generally bad. If there are many, very close in wavelength, then the trouble is ultra-short wave oscillation, due to excessive length of anode or grid leads. If it cannot be cured by a rearrange ment of the circuit, then a few ohms of resistance in the grid and anode leads will cure it. If the oscillation is of low frequency, as indicated by a row of ' whiskers ” close to the main carrier, then the trouble is in the feed circuits, possibly due to bad decoupling or too high a grid condenser or leak. There is also the possibility of two chokes producing T.P.T.G. oscillations of their own. A single strong, rough signal at some frequency other than that of the crystal is caused by ordinary self-oscillation, and if this cannot be neutrahsed out, then examine the feed circuits for a faulty condenser, or an excessively long return circuit to the'cathode. It is advisable to monitor the transmitter when in use, keeping an ear open for unauthorised fre quencies, some of which may fall outside the amateur bands. Monitoring of this type is not carried out as much as it should be, for one fre quently hears spurious oscillations, even from commercial transmissions. With such troubles, or poor neutralisation, it is impossible to produce good clickless keying, and local interference often results. Anode Efficiency The correct load for maximum efficiency in the valve is usually of the order of several thousand ohms, and much higher than the aerial impedance. To overcome this it is necessary to transform from one to the other either by tapping the real load along the anode coil or by using a small coupling coil. The correct impedance transformation is obtained in the one case by adjusting the tap position and in the other by the size and position of the coupling coil. Now the anode tuned circuit has its own losses and these will make up part of the load seen by the valve. The power dissipated by this form of loss is not available in the output circuit ; high anode The “D.X. THREE” 50-WATT TRANSMITTER. The trltet drive is on the left and push-pull P.A. on the right, set for 14 Me operation. This can be built for a total cost of about £12, plus power supplies, and will operate on four amateur bands.A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO efficiency can only be obtained by making these negligible in comparison with the desired load. This is achieved firstly by the use of high quality components, and secondly by raising the value of the anode tuning inductance to as high a value as possible, and reducing the condenser to suit. The transformed load resistance appears in parallel with the coil and so fixes its dynamic impedance at the value required for correct operation of the valve. With this fixed parallel resistance an increase of L/C ratio has the effect of reducing the “ Q ” of the circuit. (The ” Q ” has been defined in Chapter 2 as the ratio of the reactance to series resistance ; in terms of a parallel resistance it is the inverse, i.e., ratio of parallel resistance to reactance.) Thus by increasing L the Q “ on load can be made much less than that of the free circuit and all the power goes into the load. By the use of good components the free Q can be some few hundred ; on load the practical limit of Q is about 4 or 5, and this fixes the size of the coil for maximum anode efficiency. Tuned transformers of this type will not work at lower values of Q. Very often, in fact, it is not possible to attain such a high value of coil inductance owing to the stray capacities already in circuit, such as the anode/earth, and the minimum capacity of the variable condenser. On ultra-short waves this is usually one of the chief limits to efficiency, the largest possible coil already having a lower dynamic impedance than the load required by the valve even before the aerial is coupled in. To estimate the constants of the anode circuit we proceed as follow’s. Suppose the valve-operating condition (for R.F. driven P.A.) is given as 50 mA at 500 volts. This would represent a load of 10,000 ohms, but we know that the pulses go to at least 150 mA, and so the load is more like 3,000 ohms. This is the plate load, since the valve passes to practically zero impedance at the tips of the pulses. To get a Q of 5 the reactance of the coil must be one-fifth of 3,000, that is, 600 ohms. The reactance is thus one-fifteenth of the value obtained by dividing the plate voltage by the plate current. Valve Types For R.F. amplifiers or doublers, etc., the triode is the simplest type of valve and provided care is taken and sufficient drive is available very high efficiencies can be obtained, but the ratio of drive to output power is not very good at the higher efficiencies. It was seen from Fig. 1 that when the grid is at peak positive the anode potential is at its lowest. Now', the electrons emitted from the cathode are attracted through the grid to the anode when it is sufficiently positive, but at its lowest peak it tries to go below the grid potential, and its electric field tends to force the cathode emission into the grid, giving a heavy grid current ; consequently much drive power is required to overcome the damping this represents. In the pentode there is the screen between the anode and grid and this is at a steady potential well above that of the grid, and the electric field of the anode therefore has very little influence on the grid. The result is that much less power is required to drive the pentode and greater stage-to-stage power gain is possible than in the triode. On the other hand the efficiency of the pentode cannot be so great since there is the steady drain of Fig. 14. THE “D.X. THREE” TRANSMITTER. Cl .0002 variable condenser, type 957, Eddystone.

The screen voltage is usually kept fairly low compared with the anode so as to allow the latter to swing in potential. A type of valve which has been derived from the pentode has come into prominence recently and offers great prospects in transmitter design. This is known as the “ beam valve.” It is a British invention, but its R.F. type is so far only available in the U.S.A., in the 6L6 or 807 classes. By careful design it has been found possible to dispense with the suppressor grid and yet obtain behaviour like that of the pentode. (See Chapter 3.) The removal of this grid makes the anode-earth capacity of the valve very low and so high anode efficiency can be obtained at very high frequencies. This is aug mented by the fact that the load impedance required is very low and easily obtained at the high frequencies. The 807 type is one of the first valves available which can be run at full rating at 60 Me, and promises to revolutionise ultra-high frequency design. Most R.F. pentodes fall off at 30 Me and many at only 15 Me. Tuning Up the P.A., or Doubler The grid is first biased to at least cutoff, and starting with reduced H.T. the grid circuit is tuned, The drive must be enough to increase the feed to 50 mA at least in the case of a 10-watt stage. Tuning the anode to resonance without load should cause a drop to well below 10 mA. The load is then coupled up and tuned for maximum output, which will in the case quoted be about 30 mA. If the anode tuning under load does not exhibit the flatness of a low-Q circuit then it is fairly certain that an increase in coil size will improve output. If it will not draw up well as the load is coupled up, then, if there is no shortage of drive, it is possible that’the coil is too big, though this condition is not likely to occur above 7 Me where capacity is usually the limitation. The adjustment for a doubler stage is much the same except that the flatness of tuning and dip on resonance is not usually so great. Ihe frequency of the output should be checked with an absorption wavemeter. . To use the output of an oscillator to drive a subsequent stage, various couplings are available, but only the inductive type has been considered so far. The grid following the oscillator can be tapped through a condenser into the oscillator anode coil. This is not usual, except in the first stages where plenty of drive is available, but in the power stages where all possible drive is required, two inductively coupled circuits are used. Ihe direct tap leads to trouble because part of each anode circuit capacity is in the next stage, and the current branching into this must return down the common earth line, with the result that interstage coupling occurs and instability results. Also it leads to unbalance if one is stepping from a ” single-ended ’ to a push-pull stage. Link or Transmission Line Coupling. Plain inductive coupling between pairs of c.rcuits has the disadvantage that movable coils are needed for adjustment of coupling, making the construction complicated. By introducing an auxiliary circuit to do the coupling, this disadvantage is overcome. Such an arrangement, which is called link coupling,” is illustrated in Fig. 14, where it transfers the output of Vj from the coil L 2 to the grid coil L 3 of the push-pull amplifier stage. The flexible connection in the link circuit acts as a type of trans mission line. (See Chapter 7.) The energy in L 2 is stepped down to a low impedance by means of the small pickup coil ; in other words, it passes down the connecting link at low voltage and high current so as to minimise loss, and by the inverse process it is stepped up again into L 3 . The coupling coils are usually a few turns placed round or near the “ cold ” part of the coil, and the link is usually twin flex or concentric screened cable. Adjustment is made by the number and position of the turns. The couplings can be slid on and off the ends of the coils, or if the coils are self-supporting they may be slid in and out between the end turns. If there is H.T. potential on the coil the coupler can be insulated by good-grade sleeving. The link may be of any length, though if more than a few feet is used it should be built and adjusted as a proper transmission line, by first terminating the far end with the correct resistance and adjusting for maximum output, and then replacing the resistance by the receiving circuit and adjusting this end. M The couplers are placed at the “ earthy ’ part of the coils to prevent transfer by capacity as well as inductance—an undesirable feature ; in fact it is good practice to earth the link at some point. Thus in Fig. 14 the earthy point of L 3 is at the centre, and the coupler is wound over that point, whilst the earthy point of L 2 is at the H.l. end. Coupling can be adjusted by sliding at the end of L 2 . Link coupling offers the great advantage that each stage of the transmitter becomes a distinct and separate unit, and trouble from feedback disappears. If desired, the drive unit, or the P.A., can be several feet away from the rest of the appara tus, allowing much greater flexibility of layout. Then again, the links can be brought out to ordinary plugs and jacks, so that any individual stage can be brought out on the bench for adjustment. By taking R.F. drive from any part of the circuit, new circuits can be tried on a separate assembly, without dismantling the transmitter. This separation of stages by these means is not merely a convenience to suit the circumstances, but is a definite technical advantage, one of the finest aids to the suppression of undesirable emissions such as key-clicks and spurious notes, for a little spatial separation is worth any amount of screening, and helps reduce undesired couplings which so easily lead to instability. Aerial Coupling In general this is a function of the aerial, and is considered under the chapter dealing with aerials. Broadly, it consists of some means of transferring the power from the high impedance of the anode circuit to whatever impedance the aerial presents, and is usually some form of tuned transformer. There is everything in favour of a link coupling between the anode and the aerial network, though probably the simplest way is to bring the aerial or aerial feeder to a resonant condition and couple its coil to the anode with variable coupling. Ihe aerial should damp the network to flat resonance, though if it overdamps it, then it may not be possible to draw any power from the anode circuit.4G A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO V A popular method is to tap the aerial or feeder directly into the anode circuit, but this is very poor practice. Apart from the danger of having H.T. voltage in the aerial, it is the surest way to trouble, as it allows everything in the transmitter to radiate, thereby causing interference in local receivers. It also upsets the earthing arrangements, often allowing R.F. energy to flow back into the mains. A point to note is that the presence of the aerial circuit may disturb the neutralising adjustment, and it is advisable to recheck it after the aerial is set up to its coupling. This effect does not occur with link coupling. Power Supplies The design of power supplies for the anodes is considered in another chapter. For a small two- stage transmitter a single H.T. supply can be used, but with more stages it is usual to have at least two, one for the driver unit and the other for the P.A. stage. If a self-excited non-crystal oscillator is the frequency source, its power supplies should be well separated from a H.F. point of view, and should be very pure, heavy low-frequency de coupling or smoothing being used. Remember that keying or modulation of the final stages is liable to react seriously on the voltage of the H.T. supplies unless the power pack is separate, or has heavy ballast. Grid Bias There are many ways of obtaining the bias for the various stages. The first is of course from batteries, but as several hundred volts may be required this is not very convenient or economical. Another method is to use grid-leaks. This method is quite satisfactory for the early stages where the valves are not liable to come to much harm if the bias is removed, but in the final stages it is important to note that if the drive stops so does the bias, and if the valve is operating with high voltage applied it will be damaged. A third method is automatic bias, obtained from the plate current passing through a cathode resistor, which is shunted for R.F., as for'example, R 5 , C 13 in Fig. 13. Automatic bias is not easy to arrange unless a separately heated cathode is used, but this is often possible in the drive unit. In the P.A. stage, where bias to twice cut-off is needed, it results in much of the H.T. being used for bias, and makes adjust ment difficult, since when the plate current drops to zero there is no bias. It is, however, always safe. The resistor should be of sufficient wattage to take the power dissipated in it. Fourthly, a power pack may be used for bias. This should have a heavy load resistor across it, liberally tapped, and each tap or lead should have a IpF condenser between it and earth. The steady load should be at least three times the total grid current. Probably the best arrangement is to use sufficient battery or power bias to give cutoff, together with a 10,000 to 20,000 ohm grid leak in each grid return. This will give the extra bias required under full drive conditions. In switching on the trans mitter it is as well to see that the bias voltage comes up before the H.T. All the various methods of bias supply are well illustrated in the diagrams chosen, as well as a good selection of cathode connections, which are, in general, usable to choice.

The short side aerial Is for the 'phone monitor.A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 47 Components In the drive stages, ordinary receiving components can be employed, though they should be of good quality. Coils may be simple and wound on ordinary good formers. Plug-in types can be used where flexibility is needed, as, for example, the Eddystone formers. This Company’s range of small tuning condensers also helps to make the layout compact. In dealing with condensers, note that quantity of dielectric matters as well as quality. For example, bakelite end plates are not to be recommended. Condensers and coils using ceramic insulation are now available, and these are usually very good. In the final stage, where utmost efficiency is needed, the anode components, at least, must be as near perfect as possible. The variable condenser is called upon to withstand high R.F. voltages, and should have large spacing between vanes. Very often a receiving type can be dissected and rebuilt with two plates and two washers at a time, giving double spacing and a quarter of the original capacity. The anode tank coil should be of larger girth than the others, say 3 inches diameter, and composed of heavy wire or tubing, so as to give plenty of surface and very low H.F. resistance. It should be bolted straight on to the tuning condenser, or joined with similar conductor or copper strip. Neutralising condensers should be of the highest possible quality, as they must withstand more D.C. and R.F. voltage than any other part. All resistances should be of sufficient rating to dissipate the power applied. In grid leak circuits a safe figure for triodes is 10 per cent, of the anode power of the valve concerned, but for pentodes a 1-watt leak will be enough for nearly all cases. Fixed condensers must be able to withstand the voltages applied across them, and if H.F. currents of any magnitude are passed, this must be con sidered as an additional requirement. In general mica dielectric condensers are best. Planning and Building There is no best method of design, and trans mitters are often built to suit the geometry of the radio room ; the method of link coupling helps to make this possible. Certain points are worth bearing in mind, however. Each stage of the trans mitter should, as far as possible, be a separate unit, though the whole may be on one base. All parts should be as accessible as possible, though the H.T. circuits should not be exposed so as to allow acci dental contact. An ideal design would thus be housed in some sort of frame or case which can be ■j;jjj*own well open for adjustments other than normal. A rack and panel system can be built in which any stage consists of a front panel and base sliding into a frame. A stage can then be replaced by a new unit for experimental work, or brought out on to the bench for adjustment. Another system often used is to build all the stages in a row on one wooden base, no front panel being used. Condensers and coils are then mounted on brackets and insulators. A hollow base'to carry the supply wiring is desirable. Such a construction is very suitable for experimental work but is rather exposed and gets dusty quickly. An example is given in reference No. 8 cit the end of this chapter. If plain wood is to be used, it should be thoroughly seasoned, and much trouble will be saved if the plan is adopted of always giving the top and panels a covering of thin metal, say aluminium, and making all common earth connections direct to this material. A metal veneer has two advantages ; firstly, the earth impedances are low, which helps stability ; secondly, the electrostatic field from all parts of the apparatus to earth absorbs less power if it is not required to pass through a mass of dielectric, such as wood, or other insulating materials. In the same way, the magnetic field of a coil wastes power in adjacent large metal objects, and to avoid this loss the coils should be no nearer to such than one diameter. The power supplies should be kept separate from the H.F. circuits, and the feed wires should be brought up in one bunch to the various stages and not allowed to wander indiscriminately through the circuits. The power switching should be so arranged that no H.T. can be applied till after the bias and filaments are on. If a separate filament trans former is used then the mains to the H.T. primary can be taken through the filament switch and then again switched. If one transformer is used for all supplies, then an extra well insulated switch can be included in the centre tap of the H.T. winding. If suitable relays are available, all this can be worked from push buttons with the aid of thermal delay switches. A popular type of construction showing a two-stage drive unit at the bottom, an intermediate buffer stage on the middle shelf and the P.A. stage above. The Anal anode coil is mounted above for coupling convenience. The link coupling from the buffer to the P.A. can be seen as a twisted flex.48 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO Meters Meters represent an expensive part of a trans mitter and it is desirable to keep down the number if possible. One milliammeter is absolutely essential and two very desirable, and these can be arranged to measure all feed and grid currents. A 50 or 100 mA fullscale is most useful with a 10 mA for grid currents. The meter can be arranged with a plug and telephone jacks can be fitted in all circuits, as in Fig. 13. Self-closing jacks must be used and the preferred method of connection parallels the closing contacts (see Fig. 13) by cross connection ; in this way the circuit is not broken when inserting or withdrawing the plug, thus there is no arcing at the contacts. There is no reason why a low reading meter should not be used with the appropriate shunt across each jack, the multiplying factors being marked over the jacks. Examples Two designs have been selected to illustrate the principles of transmitter design. The first, known as “ The D.X. Three,” is built to the circuit of Fig. 13. It comprises a tritet oscillator which drives a push-pull P.A. A receiving-type output pentode in the tritet taking about 25 mA at 350 volts will drive a pair of RFP 15 valves to about 50 watts input, on any of four amateur bands. Band change is made by changing the coils, and normally the second harmonic of the tritet is used, though for 3 • 5 Me is shorted to make it a straight pentode C.O. The links are set up on the plug-in coils. The drive unit can be seen to the left of the illustration, well separated from the P.A. Note the link coupling. The P.A. uses two ganged condensers on both grid and anode sides for condenser tap balancing, and it will be seen that these are arranged for short wiring to the valves. Since no external screening is applied to the valves small neutralising condensers are needed, as already described. The whole transmitter is built up on a metal deck, with R.F. wiring above and service wiring concealed below. The P.A. stage takes a current of about 100 mA at 500 volts on load, the screens take about another 15 mA and the grid current is about 15 mA with up to 70 volts negative bias. This bias, and up to 40 volts positive for the suppressor grids, can be obtained from a single 120 volt dry battery, with chassis connected at about 80 volts on the battery. The suppressor current is only a few mA. (See reference 14 at the end of this chapter.) The second example is somewhat more elaborate and its radio frequency circuit is given in Fig. 13, whilst the illustration on page 46 shows its modulator unit and aerial coupler and the rack type of assembly. This transmitter will run at 100 watts on C.W. or 25 watts on telephony. The modulator unit and monitor are on the bottom deck, the drive unit on the next and the P.A. stage at the top. Above is built out a universal type of aerial coupler. The drive unit is of a type known as the ' Jones Exciter ” and uses two twin triode valves. V 3 is a combined crystal oscillator and doubler, whilst V 4 is a second doubler of the push-push type. This unit alone will give an output of 10 watts on any of three bands and makes an interesting little trans mitter on its own. By switching of the link circuit the ouput can be taken from any of its three stages, the valve V 4 being out of action in some cases. The link coils are L 10 , L u and L 12 , and these are taken to the switch S 2 , whence they may go to an aerial coupler or via L 5 to drive the P.A. The unit can be used thus as a single C.O. or a C.O. with one or two doublers. With the aid of crystals in the 1-7, 3 -5 and 7 Me bands drive is available on any band from 1 • 7 to 28 Me. Plug-in coils are used to give the various combinations. Note that in the push- push doubler a plain step-up transformer is used in the grid circuit. The P.A. stage is again push-pull with split stator condensers in grid and anode, which can be seen in the picture. The method of shielding the input from the output circuit can also be seen, the valves passing through holes in the metal screen. Telephony modulation is done by the application of audio frequency voltages to the suppressor grids and for this purpose the suppressor must be biased negative to reduce the standing carrier output power as explained in Chapter 5. For telegraphy it may be given positive voltage for maximum output, and this change is made by the switch S 1 . Jacks are shown at all points where anode or grid currents are measured, but if sufficient meters are available they may of course be wired in permanently. For detailed description see reference 12 at the end of this chapter.

It is impossible to transmit intelligence without making some change or variation in this H.F. current. We may, for example, completely interrupt it at suitable intervals, thus breaking it into the so-called ' dots and dashes ” of the morse code. Alternatively, we may periodically change the amplitude in some desired manner and in this way transmit audible sounds or perhaps visible images. For simplicity we shall treat the transmission of morse signals first. Keying Requirements In order to transmit telegraphy, we must be able to reduce the H.F. aerial currents to zero at will. For amateur transmitters, it is usual to use a hand-operated key for this purpose. It is necessary to arrest the flow of H.F. current completely in order that no radiation shall be produced in between the dots and dashes. A further requirement is that the operation of keying shall not cause any variation in the frequency of the transmission, because this will render the reception of the signals difficult, and perhaps impossible, and will also cause interference with other transmitting stations. It is also desirable to keep the currents and voltages in the keying circuit within reason to prevent arcing at the key contacts, which would cause them to become dirty and unreliable. Also unless elaborate precautions are taken there may be an element of danger with high voltages on the key. It is, of course, necessary to arrange the circuit in which the key is situated so that it can be extended to a convenient position near the receiver. Another very important requirement for satisfactory keying is that the H.F. current must not be interrupted nor started too suddenly, because a great deal of interference in neighbouring receivers might be so produced. Further reference will be made to this point. Keying Circuits The most obvious place to insert the key is in the source of H.F. energy, 'i.e., the master oscillator stage of the transmitter, since when this stops oscillating there will be no output from a correctly neutralised transmitter. This, however, is to be strongly deprecated, as it is difficult to avoid changing the frequency of the oscillator slightly when the key is operated. This applies to a certain extent with even a crystal oscillator, and in any case throws unnecessary loading on the crystal. As a result it is more usual to key one of the transmitter stages following the master oscillator. In low power outfits it is quite common to key directly in the high tension circuit of the power amplifier. If this is done the key is preferably placed in the negative lead as shown in Fig. 1A. This has the disadvantage that when the key is open it is possible to receive a shock from the H.T. supply by putting one’s fingers across the key contacts. A circuit which does not have this disadvantage is shown in Fig. IB, where the key is con nected directly in the grid leak circuit. When the key is raised, the grid collects a very high negative charge, and the anode current of the valve ceases to flow. It is necessary that the insulation resistance of the key and the grid circuit should be very high to get satisfactory grid blocking ; other wise there will be a ten dency for the valve to “ squegger.” It is prob ably better to combine both these types of keying in the circuit shown in Fig. 1C. Here the key is connected in the cathode circuit and it will be seen that it interrupts both the grid and the anode circuit simultaneously. When directly heated filament valves are used, the key will, of course, be placed in the centre tap lead of the filament trans former. Fig. ID shows an alternative arrange ment which has some advantages. An ad ditional grid bias battery is employed a§ shown. This battery is placed in series with the normal battery and is so connected through the resistance R that Fig. 1. Four typical methods of keying a transmitter. 50• GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO when the key is open, the grid receives a bias equal to the sum of the two batteries. This bias must be so arranged that the anode current is reduced completely to zero. When the key is closed, the normal working grid bias is applied and the additional or over-bias is shunted by the resistance R. R should not be of too low a value, a value of from 1,000 to 5,000 ohms for every volt of over-bias being suitable. When screen-grid and pentode valves are used in a transmitter, advantage of the additional electrodes may be taken for keying purposes. The screen circuits may be keyed in the same way as anode circuits but unfortunately reducing the screen voltage to zero seldom completely stops radiation. With a pentode, however, the tube can be completely cut off by reducing the suppressor grid potential from the usual small positive value to a sufficiently high negative value. Batteries may be used for this purpose, but Fig. 2 shows how this voltage may be obtained automatically. The value of R must be found experimentally so that the value is cut off with the key raised. A fairly high value, such as 10,000 to 50,000 ohms, is necessary. stages and to apply the chosen circuit to one of the doubler stages or perhaps a buffer amplifier. Keying Filters When primary keying is employed, the circuit is effectively interrupted previous to the H.T. smooth ing circuit. The current is prevented from growing rapidly by means of the low frequency chokes and from dying rapidly by the smoothing condensers. The effect is illustrated in Fig. 4A. In the case of the keying circuits shown in Fig. 1, the current will start and stop suddenly, as illustrated in Fig. 4B. HIGH VOLTAGE. LIVE SIDE. O t I O- 200V. ^20 W HFC LAMP X £X EARTH SIDE. HFC vm/ rv liT Fig. 3. Primary Keying. Fig. 2. Suppressor Grid Keying for Pentodes. When using rectified A.C. for the H.T. supply, the primary circuit of the H.T. transformer may be interrupted by the key, but this can only be done where a separate transformer is used to heat the rectifier filaments. When using primary keying in this way, it is generally necessary to connect some load across the transformer primary in order to stop heavy surges due to the magnetising current. This may take the form of an ordinary incandescent lamp ; sometimes a Neon lamp is used. H.F. surges are also apt to be sent back into the mains when keying in the primary in this manner, and it is generally advisable to utilise an H.F. filter to prevent this effect. A suitable filter is illustrated in Fig. 3. Unless the power to the final stage of the transmitter is less than about 40 watts it is generally advisable to key the supply to the frequency doublers or buffer only. For keying high power transmitters, any of the previous circuits may be employed, but it is always best to avoid keying the high power c, 0.01 /xF to 0.05 fxF. C, 0.001 fiF.

This causes signals to be radiated over a very wide band of frequencies at the moment of opening and closing the key, and will produce severe interference in the nature of “ clicks ” in neighbouring receivers even when these receivers may be tuned to some frequency widely different from that of the trans mitter. In order to avoid this effect, the waveshape of the signal must be similar to Fig. 4A, i.e., the sharp corners must be rounded off. This is done satisfactorily when primary keying, provided the condensers in the smoothing circuit are not too large. If this is the case, the signals will “ tail ” and be difficult to read. To prevent this, the condensers should be reduced in value and the inductances increased to keep the smoothing good. When using the type of circuits shown in Fig. 1, the rounding off of the signals is accomplished by the use of a key-thump filter of the type shown in Fig. 5. The condenser here prevents the circuitA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO from being interrupted immediately the key is open. The resistance in series with the condenser prevents sparking at the key contacts when the key is closed. Suitable values must be chosen for each particular case, and it is always advisable to use a monitor to check that the signal output is satisfactory. If the regulation of the H.T. supply is poor, the high voltage which may be produced when there is no load will produce a peak at the beginning of each signal as shown in Fig. 4C. This may cause trouble and should be prevented by the use of an artificial load across the H.T. supply, taking approxi mately 15 per cent, to 20 per cent, of the full load current.

Keying Valves It is sometimes convenient to key the grid circuit of an additional valve whose sole function is to control the current to one or more of the ordinary transmitter circuits. In Fig. 6 a triode is connected in series with the main H.T. negative lead. When the key is closed the triode will pass the fuel current of the keyed stage losing a few volts only but when the key is open the resistance R forms an automatic bias resistance for the keying valve, and if sufficiently high (say 20,000 to 50,000 ohms) will reduce the current almost to zero. The keying valve must obviously be capable of passing the full load anode current of the keyed stage, but it should be noted that the anode dissipation will not be excessive as the voltage on the anode of the keying valve will not be very high. More elaborate keying filters may be used in the grid circuit if desired. Keying Relays Where considerable power is being keyed or where the key is located in a very remote position from the transmitter, it is advisable to use a relay. In this case the key closes a local battery circuit which operates the relay ; the relay contacts are connected in the circuit in the place of the key* When a relay is used a small mica condenser should always be connected across the key contacts in the local circuit to prevent clicks due to small amounts of high frequency energy generated by the spark from being radiated by the long key leads. This remark also applies to direct keying when long leads are used even if a filter is employed at the transmitter end. A value of -01 pF would be suitable. Broadcast Interference Interference with neighbouring broadcast receivers will always be less when a coupled circuit is used in the output of the transmitter. Direct tapping of the aerial on to the tank circuit generally causes a great deal of trouble of this nature. The so-called Collins coupler [see Chapter 7, page 80) very often helps to reduce this kind of interference as the radiation of harmonics is considerably reduced. If interference with broadcast receivers cannot be eliminated by all possible efforts at the transmitter, local remedies at the receiver must be employed. A small choke coil inserted in the receiving aerial is usually a certain cure. The dimensions are not critical but the length of wire on the coil should preferably be in the order of a quarter-wavelength of the interfering signal. A smaller choke with a tuning condenser in parallel with it will form a wavetrap which should be still more effective. Sometimes the trouble can be traced to the intro duction of H.F. current into the mains which in turn pass it on to the receiver. This applies particularly to receivers in the same house as the transmitter. The provision of H.F. chokes in each mains lead to the receiver with a mica con denser across the mains terminals will generally cure the trouble. The insulation of the chokes and condenser should, of course, be suitable for the mains voltage. Considerable assistance in the matter of broadcast interference will be found in a series of three articles in the T. &amp;- R. Bulletin, dated December, 1933, January, 1934, and May, 1934. Modulation—General Principles If we require to appeal to one of the human senses directly, without the process of translation which the morse code requires, we must vary the H.F. aerial current to a particular predetermined degree and not just interrupt it at suitable intervals. Whether we are transmitting sound or vision we must convert the sound or light into electrical currents of exactly corresponding frequency and amplitude. We shall in this chapter confine ourselves to the transmission of sounds only. Let us suppose that we have already achieved this conversion from acoustic waves to electrical currents, about which more will be said later. We have the choice of varying either the frequency or the amplitude of the H.F. currents in the transmitting Fig. 6. Using a valve for Keying. See T. &amp;■ R. Bulletin, July, 1932.A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 53 aerial, which is generally called the “ carrier.” The variation of the amplitude of this current is the only practicable system of transmitting telephony used by amateurs. It is important that, once amplitude modulation has been decided upon, every step possible shall be taken to prevent frequency modulation as well. Considerable distortion would otherwise result and the likelihood of interference with other stations is greatly increased. Fig. 7. A. Nature of acoustic waveform which is to be trans mitted . B. A constant amplitude (unmodulated) carrier wave. C. The carrier modulated by Curve A. D. A carrier modulated by a single low-frequency. E. Full or 100 per cent, modulation. P. Overmodulation. Fig. 7A shows a curve which may be taken to represent part of a complex sound waveform. B of the same figure illustrates the constant amplitude H.F. current in the aerial, i.e., the carrier. C shows the carrier varied in ampli tude to conform to the curve shown in Fig. 7A. Such a carrier is said to be “modulated.” The frequency is unaltered, but the amplitude is constantly changing and is defined by the dotted line which is called the modulation envelope. For purposes of explanation it is more simple to consider the transmission of a single low frequency. For example, Fig. 7D illustrates a carrier wave modulated by the sine wave shown with the dotted line. When the modulation is such that the amplitude of the carrier is increased to twice its average value, and decreased to exactly nothing, the modulation is said to be complete, or 100 per cent. This is shown in Fig. 7E. If the modulation exceeds 100 per cent, we have the condition shown in F, in this case 150 per cent. Such a condition is referred to as “ over modulation.” This causes the carrier to “ break ” or become zero over a considerable period. The radiation of a wide waveband is produced by this effect and considerable interference with local receivers as well as distortion of the transmitted signal will almost certainly result. It should be noted that up to 100 per cent, modulation the average value of the carrier is constant and except in the case of controlled carrier transmission to be described later, this will always be so. The percentage modulation is defined as :— max. modulated a mplitude - carr i er a mplitude ^ 100 , carrier amplitude Since the maximum current at 100 per cent, modula tion is twice the carrier current the peak power must be 4 times the carrier power. The effective power input at 100 per cent, modulation is 1-5 times the carrier power, hence to modulate the carrier fully, the average power in it must be increased by 50 per cent. In order to produce 100 per cent, modulation we must therefore be able to supply a low frequency power of an amount equal to one half the carrier power. For example, to modulate a 10-watt carrier fully we shall require 5 watts of audio frequency power. Since power varies as the square of current, the aerial current will rise to VFfi = 1-226 or by 22-6 per cent. Aerial current meters do not of course follow the modulation frequencies. All the usual types indicate R.M.S. current, which increases on modula tion. As already shown, this increase will be approximately 22£ per cent, when the carrier is modulated fully by a sine wave. Speech and music waves, however, are peaky in nature and the R.M.S. value may be very much less than for a sine wave for the same peak value. This gives a very much smaller increase in the measured cicrid.! current. For example when a transmitter is being modulated to a peak va’ue of 100 per cent, with ordinary speech the average value of the modulation is in the order of 30 per cent. When using a continuous pure tone (sine wave) for modulating, however, the percentage modulation can be obtained by what is sometimes called the Heising formula.-V A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO If I 0 = R.M.S. value of unmodulated aerial current (as read in a hotwire or thermo-junction meter).

Increase of I 0 Modulation 22-5 100 13-0 75 6-0 50 1-5 25 Methods of Modulation We now have to see how to achieve this variation of aerial current. One obvious method is to vary the resistance of the circuit in which it flows. This may be done by the insertion of a carbon microphone in the aerial circuit. It is, however, a very unsatisfactory method, because the micro phone is at radio frequency potential and there is a limit to the current for which microphones can be built to carry. Secondly, we may vary the output of an oscillating valve circuit by varying the anode volts, the grid volts, or maybe the screen volts at the modulated frequency. When this method is applied to self-oscillating valves, the frequency is also likely to be varied and while frequency modulation has been used successfully, frequency and amplitude modulation together can only produce serious distortion. In order to keep the frequency stable, therefore, it is usual to modulate only driven amplifier stages. Let us consider first of all modulation by varying the anode volts of a driven amplifier valve. It is necessary for the modulation envelope to correspond to the low frequency modulation input. Thus the output H.F. current must be proportional to the anode voltage. This is achieved by the use of what is called a ' Class C amplifier.” This is an H.F. amplifier where the grid bias is at least twice the cut-off value, and where the H.F. input or drive is very large. Fig. 8 shows by the full line the ideal case, where proportionality is achieved between the applied anode voltage and the H.F. output ; in other words, when the anode voltage is doubled the H.F. output current is also exactly doubled. In practice this curve may be very closely approxi mated to as shown by the dotted line. There are two common methods of varying the anode voltage of a modulated H.F. amplifier. Choke or Heising Modulation This method is illustrated in Fig. 9. The H.T. supply feeds both the oscillator valve Vi and the modulator valve V 2 through a common L.F. choke L s , which has a high impedance to all modulation frequencies. The circuit shown for Vj, is a typical neutralised power amplifier, and Cj being the tank circuit, and L 2 and C 2 the usual H.F. choke and bypass condenser. It will be seen that con sidering the valve V 2 as an ordinary Class A low- frequency amplifier, the valve \ j is its anode load. By this we mean that the inductance L 3 by virtue- of its high impedance, prevents any audio frequency change of H.T. current, and consequently the anode voltage variations of V 2 are applied directly to the anode of V v and all the audio frequency output power of V 2 is delivered into \ j. W hen V ^ is- arranged as a Class C amplifier described above, it will be found that its resistance defined as- anode voltage su b stant i a iiy constant, anode current This resistance is the load impedance of the modulator. For 100 per cent, modulation we must swing the anode voltage of Vj from its normal value to twice PEAK OUTPUT — IDEAL FORM FOR DISTORTIONLESS TRANSMISSION USUAL FORM IN PRACTICE APPLIED ANODE VOLTAGE. Fig. 8. Relationship between anode voltage and output of a modulated R.F. amplifier. its normal value and down to zero without distortion 1 at all modulation frequencies. We must therefore arrange that the value of the anode load of the modulator is suitable for the valve employed. It will be clear that we cannot swing over this- range of voltage with the same H.T. voltage on the modulator as on the Class C amplifier, because- the maximum anode swing we can obtain from any Class A amplifier without distortion is considerably less than its own anode volts. We must therefore arrange that we have more H.T. voltage on the modulat r than on the driven amplifier. Fig. Iff illustrates several methods of achieving this result. Fig. 10A shows a circuit very similar to Fig. 9 except that Vi is fed through a resistance R, shunted by a condenser C 3 . This resistance produces a drop in anode volts of Vj equal to the anode current of Vj, multiplied by R. Knowing the maximum anode swing to which we may drive V 2 , we can drop the anode volts of V 1 by means of R to be just one-half this value, and we must drive V - ! to such an anode current that its anode voltage divided by its anode current gives the optimum load for V t . The distortionless output from V 2 must be enough to- swing this impedance to twice the unmodulated anode volts of V 1 . This will enable us to fix the-“’—s . . .■ r\c Tr\ AMATFUR RADIO Wireless World “ The Practical Radio and Television Journal which gives the best Technical help for the Wireless Amateur What is new in the world of radio and television, both in theory and practice, is recorded week by week in THE WIRELESS WORLD.

We can thus find R, which will be equal to the difference in anode voltage of V, and divided by the anode current of C 3 is put in the circuit to bypass the resistance R for the modulation frequencies and is usually of the order of 1 to 2 p.F. In order to produce very low frequency modulation satisfactorily, the reactance of L 3 at the lowest modulation frequency must be greater than the impedances of Vx and V , in parallel. A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO Li rW^ of V 2 is not at zero D.C. potential, and the windings of the transformer or batteries employed to light this filament must be suitably insulated. It is also necessary to have good insulation between the primary and secondary of the low frequency trans former which feeds the grids of the modulator. In Fig. 11B the positions of modulator and modu lated amplifier are reversed. The modulator filament is in this case at earth potential and the modulated amplifier filament and grid circuits are at a D.C. potential above earth. This means that we must employ some form of inductive coupling, for example, link coupling for the H.F. valve. In this type of modulator there is no L.F. loss due to the modulation choke, but we must beware iLi f / WVWVr y ^^ v -° + ♦ v i f—\ I UT R l_3 H -T Hh Fig. 9. Simple Choke Modulation Circuit. In Fig. 10B the required anode voltages are applied directly to the respective valves by means of low frequency chokes L 3 and L 4 . In order to couple the two anodes together, condenser C 4 is connected. In Fig. IOC the maximum per missible swing of V 2 is increased by means of a suitably designed transformer T. The anode swing is of course increased by the turns ratio, but notice that the impedance of the load is now equal to the anode voltage of Vx divided by its anode current divided by the square of the turns ratio. An important feature of this circuit is that the direction of the windings on T can be so arranged that some of the D.C. magnetisation of the core is balanced out. Push-pull Class C power amplifiers may be modulated in an exactly similar manner by any of these three circuits. Series Modulation Instead of feeding the modulator and modulated amplifier in parallel through a choke, we can feed them in series as shown in Fig. 11. This obviates the use of a cumbersome and expensive low frequency inductance. The driven H.F. amplifier is still the load for the modulator and the conditions stipulated for choke control still hold. The voltage drop across the modulator will require to be considerably greater than across the modulated amplifier in order to secure full modulation as in the choke control case. The valves are chosen to efiect this with the required H.F. drive on the amplifier and bias on the modulator. Two arrangements are possible. In Fig. 11A the modulated amplifier is connected with its cathode to the negative of the H.T. supply and the modulator V 3 is connected in series with the positive lead. This means of course that the filament58 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO of the capacity across the modulator anode circuit due to the capacity of the filament windings to earth which may produce a loss of high modulation frequencies. Design of Modulator In all the foregoing circuits the modulator valve has been shown as a single triode for simplicity, but there is no reason why one or more valves should not be put in parallel to obtain more audio frequency output. Single modulator valves must always be worked as Class A amplifiers, i.e., their grids must never be driven positive nor far into the curved part of the characteristic. They must always be arranged to have their optimum anode load which is usually of the order of two to three times the anode impedance of the valve. If these conditions are not observed, considerable harmonic distortion will be introduced, which distortion must also occur in the received speech or music. Frequency distortion, i.e., the production of various degrees of modulation at different fre quencies when a constant input at all frequencies is applied to the modulator grid, must also be avoided. This is liable to occur in the input transformer to the modulator grid unless this is of suitable design. This, however, is purely a question of low frequency amplifier design. In the modu lator itself a loss of bass frequency response is most likely to occur with choke control. It is necessary for the inductance of the choke when carrying the total D.C. in the circuit, to be such that its reactance, i.e., 27rfL where f is the lowest modulation frequency, shall be preferably two or three times the impedance of the modulator and modulated amplifier in parallel. Similarly condenser C, in the circuits of Fig. 10, while being large enough to bypass the radio frequencies, which is its true purpose, must not have a reactance at the highest audio frequency which is low compared with the two valve impedances in parallel. If this reactance becomes less than say twice the parallel valve impedance, there will be a noticeable loss of H.F. modulation. Using Class A amplifiers as modulators, it is not possible to obtain a better anode efficiency than about 15 per cent. To increase this, we may use two Class A valves in push-pull. Owing toTthe cancellation of even harmonics by this method, we can obtain more power out of such a modulator than with the same two valves in parallel, and may, for amateur purposes at least, get efficiencies up to 25 per cent. When using push-pull modulators, however, it is always necessary to employ an output transformer. The type of circuit shown in Fig. 10 C can obviously be modified to employ a push-pull modulator stage. Of recent years high efficiency modulators have been developed where two valves are used in push- pull, but working with Class B characteristics, i.e.,’both valves are biased to cutoff, and only pass anode current when audio frequency drive is applied. The L.F. voltage applied to the grids may be such as to drive them positive and grid current will flow at the peaks. This type of modu lator, however, requires considerably more care in adjustment in order to obtain good results, and is certainly not to be recommended for beginners. The important points to remember with Class B modulator stages are, firstly that the previous stage or driver must deliver the power absorbed by the grid circuit. This means to say that it must be of the nature of a power amplifier and not a voltage amplifier, and will generally have to deliver about 10 per cent, of the maximum B stage out put. It is usual to arrange a low impedance valve for this purpose and also very often to use a step-down transformer to the grids of the Class B stages. This is to ensure that the Class B valves are fed from a low impedance in the grid circuit, thus enabling grid current to be drawn without distorting the input waveform. It is also very necessary that the regulation of the high tension supply to the modulator stage shall be very good, since the anode current is constantly varying during modulation, and falls to zero when the input ceases. It is also essential, unless a D.C. generator is employed, to use mercury vapour rectifiers with a well designed choke input smoothing circuit. For the same reason grid bias cannot be conveniently obtained from a cathode resistance and either a battery supply or a separate small rectifier should be used. A special type of valve, known as a “ Beam ” valve (see Chapter 3) is very popular in Class B circuits. The American 6L6 and the Mazda AC4Pen are examples. Further information on this subject will be found in the chapter dealing with power supplies. In compensation for these difficulties of design efficiencies up to 50 per cent, or 60 per cent, can be obtained. When operating with quite low powers it is possible to use some of the Class B valves which have been specially designed for this purpose for use as output stages of ordinary broadcast receivers. These valves really consist of two separate valves in one bulb and possess a characteristic which makes them particularly suitable for Class B operation. Grid Modulation It is possible with care to modulate a radio frequency amplifier by varying its grid bias at the modulation frequencies. The modulated stage of this type always draws the same anode power from its H.T. supply, but the variation of gridA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 1 bias alters its efficiency as a radio frequency ampli fier during the modulation cycle and hence the radio frequency output. It necessitates much less audio power to modulate a stage in this manner, but for a given H.F. amplifier valve and given anode voltage, less modulated output is obtained than when using an anode modulated amplifier. Fig. 12. Grid-Modulation. Fig. 12 shows V 1 as a typical radio frequency amplifier where its grid bias, which is fed through the usual H.F. choke in the grid circuit, consists of a fixed bias which should be a battery supply, in series with the output from the modulator stage V 2 , via a low frequency transformer. It is usual to’ make the value of the fixed grid bias about 50 per cent, more than the cutoff value. The H.F. input is then adjusted to make the H.F. amplifier just take grid current. The grid drive is then reduced until the aerial current falls to half of its previous value. Full modulation will be obtained when V 1 just shows grid current on modulation peaks.

The economy which is effected in the audio frequency gear required is generally outweighed by the considerably large H.F. amplifier valves required to produce a given full modulated output. Modulating Screen Grid Amplifiers Where tetrodes or screen grid valves are used for the modulated stage, it is possible to produce modulation by varying the screen voltage, but unfortunately only low modulations can be produced without distortion and the adjustments are very critical. It is also possible to modulate the anode voltage of a screen grid valve, but difficulties are soon encountered when full modulation is attempted owing to the secondary emission which occurs when the anode voltage is less than the screen voltage. This difficulty can be overcome by modulating the anode voltage and the screened voltage simultaneously and in the correct proportion, but there is very little to recommend the method. Modulation of R.F. Pentodes Radio frequency amplifiers employing pentodes are now becoming common owing to their high efficiency, and they can fortunately be modulated very easily by varying the suppressor grid potential. For a given anode voltage and radio frequency grid drive, the output is dependent upon the suppressor grid potential. As a small change in voltage on the suppressor grid produces a con siderable change in output power, we have available a means of modulating considerable H.F. energy with quite a small audio frequency input. The modulated peak output power of such a stage will be comparable with the carrier output of a Class C stage working under similar operating conditions. The correct method of adjusting a pentode modulated stage is firstly to obtain maximum radio-frequency output with the suppressor grid at the recom mended maximum voltage, then reduce the sup pressor grid voltage keeping the drive constant until the anode current is reduced to half its previous O + ANODE. O + SCREEN. •Total load for both valves,60 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO value. The L.F. modulation voltage is then added in series with the suppressor grid bias. Fig. 13 shows Vj as a radio frequency pentode arranged for suppressor grid modulation. LjCj is the tank circuit which is not shown with a neutral ising circuit, although this may be necessary with some pentodes. The screened grid voltage is applied as usual with C 2 as a bypass condenser to earth. The suppressor grid voltage is fed through the radio frequency filter L 2 and Cg, from the suppressor grid bias in series with a resistance RV 2 is the modulator valve which is generally of the Class A variety and supplies the modulating voltage across R through the transformer T.

Power Having discussed ways and means of modulating H.F. energy, we must now consider in what stage of the transmitter this is best done. In order to avoid distortion, we must not frequency-multiply our carrier after it has been modulated. Thus we cannot modulate before the actual transmitted carrier frequency has been produced. For most amateur sets this means that the modulation must take place in the final P. A. stage. The modulated radio frequency energy is thus fed straight into the aerial. If we require the power to be increased after modulation, it is necessary to use a so-called “ linear ” or “ Class B ” amplifier. In this class of amplifier, the output power is proportional to the square of the input voltage. Although some distortion is necessarily produced, the radio fre quency harmonics are filtered out by the use of a tuned anode circuit in the usual manner, but the amplitude of the output H.F. current is proportional to the input driving voltage. In this way no distortion of the modulation is produced. In general the construction and arrangement of such an amplifier is exactly the same as the Class C amplifier, but the grid bias must be fixed and is generally made equal to or slightly less than the cutoff value. The amplifier is then driven from a Class C amplifier which has been modulated by one of the foregoing methods. In practice the Class B amplifier is tuned to give the maximum aerial current possible with an unmodulated drive. The drive should not be enough to cause very heavy grid current, although a reasonable amount is permissible. The drive is then reduced until the aerial current is half the previous value. When the previous stage is modulated to 100 per cent. the aerial current will rise to double its unmodulated value and the peak power will be four times the unmodulated carrier power. A Class B amplifier therefore has to work with only a quarter of the carrier power which would be obtainable from the same tube operated as Class C, and therefore we do not qbtain such a considerable economy in overall power of both modulating and H.F. stage as might be at first expected when modulating a low power stage, rather than modulating the last stage of the transmitter. On the other hand we do save considerably on the size of the L.F. equip ment which may be convenient in certain circum stances. One useful feature of this method of designing a transmitter is that by increasing the bias on the Class B amplifier beyond the value suggested above and by driving harder to keep up the output it is possible to increase the per centage modulation, so that if we cannot modulate the Class C amplifier fully, it is possible to raise the modulation to 100 per cent, in the Class B stage. This, however, must be done with care and a certain amount of experience is required to obtain good results. Controlled Carrier Telephony All the modulation systems described so far employ an R.F. stage which produces a carrier wave whose average value is constant, the degree of modulation varying from instant to instant according to the speech input. This means that even when no speech is being transmitted the full carrier is radiated. This represents unnecessary radiated energy and may cause heterodyne interference even during periods of no modulation. In the controlled carrier system the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied according to demand so that the modulation percentage is always in the order of 100 per cent. That is to say, when the speech input is low the carrier amplitude is small but as the input rises the carrier is auto matically increased by an amount which just prevents overmodulation. Comparison of Fig. 14 with Fig. 7 will make this clear. It is necessary to ensure that the average carrier shall increase as rapidly as the speech input demands and decrease to a small value immediately the speech ceases. Fig. 14. Controlled Carrier Telephony.A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 61 The advantages are :— (a) Economy in power supplied to the R.F. stages since full anode power only obtains when the speech input is a maximum. This means that smaller valves may be used for the same peak output. (b) Reduction in heterodyne interference with other transmitters. (c) Reduction in received noise level at low speech levels. The value of R can be so set that the modulation voltage is just sufficient to give full but not over modulation. Such a circuit when correctly adjusted can give good commercial quality, particularly if the bias of V 3 and V 4 is so adjusted that there is a minimum carrier of about 10 per cent, of maximum, but first-class quality is not easy to obtain. Similar valves are generally used in all four positions. Fig. 15. Controlled Carrier Circuit using Class B Modulator. Several methods can be employed. One is to control the grid bias or suppressor grid voltage of the modulated stage in sympathy with the average value of the modulation. Alternatively the anode voltage may be varied. Since the introduction of Class B modulators the latter method has become popular. In Fig. 15, V 1 and V 2 form a push-pull radio frequency stage of conventional type which is to be modulated. V 3 and \ 4 are the Class B modulator valves. These function as already described. The audio input is applied through transformer T 4 to the modulated grids. Note that a fixed bias is necessary to hold these valves at nearly cutoff. The audio voltage developed across R on the secondary of the output transformer Tj is applied to the anodes of V 4 and V 2 via the tank inductance. The main H.T. supply, which must be of good regulation, is applied to the R.F. stage and the modulator in series. That is to say the negative is connected to the modulator cathodes, the positive to the anodes of V 4 and V 2 , wdiile the cathodes of the latter are connected to the anodes of the modulators through the centre-tap of the primary of T,. When there is no audio input the anode current of V 3 and V 4 is almost zero due to their bias. Thus the anode voltage of Vi and V 2 is very low and a very small carrier is produced. When the speech input is applied, the anode current of V 3 and V 4 rises, enabling Vx and V 2 to feed and produce a carrier which is modulated by the audio voltage which occurs across R. The condenser C which is generally 1 or 2 pF prevents the actual modulation voltage from reaching the valves by this path and makes the carrier vary according to the mean value of the speech wave. Duplex Telephony Duplex telephony is a term used for a system of transmission where the transmitter and receiver are simultaneously in operation at each of the two contacting stations. In this way either operator may talk at any moment instead of waiting for the other to “go over.” The commonest w'ay of doing this is to use some form of carrier control transmission where the carrier falls to zero with no speech input. Another term for this type of transmission is “ quiescent carrier.” In addition it may be advisable to use special aerials for trans mitter and receiver ; the latter will require to be as selective as possible. If the two transmitters are at opposite ends of the band then controlled carrier may not be necessary, in which case, apart from being particularly careful to avoid over modulation, there are no special points to be considered in the design of the actual transmitter. It will, however, be necessary to screen the receiver carefully and if it is mains operated to ensure that no R.F. energy gets back into the mains. Microphones Our next task is to see how we can produce electrical currents of a waveform exactly corres ponding to the sound waves which are to be trans mitted. It is necessary for this purpose to use a microphone. The subject of microphone design and operation is large enough to fill a chapter of its own, but unfortunately we can spare space for an outline only. The simplest type of microphone and the earliest to be invented, consists of a number of granules of carbon in loose contact, carrying the electric62 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 1 li current. When these granules are jostled by means of a diaphragm which is set in vibration by a sound wave, the resistance of the contacts between the carbon granules is varied and consequently the current in the circuit will vary more or less in sympathy with the sound pressures. There are two general types of carbon microphones in use, first, the type used in ordinary commercial telephony. This includes the common solid back type of microphone. The great advantage of this instrument is that it gives a high electrical output, but the quality of reproduction obtained from it will certainly not exceed that of commercial tele phony and it is necessary to speak close to the instrument, which is generally held in the hand. Two to six volts is usual and a step-up transformer with a ratio of 1 : 50 used in conjunction with such a microphone will generally produce enough to operate the modulator grid direct. carbon microphones ' blasting ” is generally trouble some with loud speech or music, and for this reason they are not generally used for very high quality V reproduction. Fig. 16 shows a typical amateur- made microphone of this type. Crystal Microphones The best type of crystal microphones produce substantially perfect speech quality and are rather expensive instruments. Very much cheaper instru ments working on the same principle are, however, on the market and give very good results in amateur sets. The crystal employed is a type of Rochelle salt which, when vibrated by means of a diaphragm, produces a Piezo-electric voltage in a similar manner to the quartz crystal used for stabilising trans mitters. It is, however, a much more sensitive material than quartz and with two stages of ampli fication, adequate output is obtained for small modulators. Fig. 16. An amateur-built Carbon Microphone, An improved version of the carbon microphone is the type referred to as the “ transverse ” current microphone. In this case a mica diaphragm is employed behind which is a very thin layer of fine carbon granules. Current is passed from one edge of this layer to the other in a direction at right angles to the sound pressure. The frequency response is very much better than any ordinary commercial type, but the output obtainable is much less. It is usually necessary to use either two or three resistance-coupled stages of amplifica tion in order to load up, for example, a PX.25 modulator valve. An input transformer for such a microphone must have a primary suitable for a 300-500 ohm circuit and a ratio of about 1 : 20 is common. Using a polarising voltage of 6 volts, feed currents of 15 to 20 mA are usual. In all Condenser Microphones In this type of microphone a condenser is used, of which one plate forms the diaphragm. The spacing between the plates is very small and when the diaphragm vibrates the capacity of the con denser is varied. A polarising voltage is applied to the microphone in series with a very high grid leak. The grid of a valve is connected to one end of the grid leak and the cathode to the other, using of course a suitable grid bias and a de coupling circuit to keep the polarising voltage from the grid. The potentials developed across the res : stance when the microphone capacity is varied by sound waves are thus amplified. It is generally necessary to put the first stage of the amplifier in close proximity with the microphone; consequently this form of microphone is commonly built into a so-called “ head amplifier.” Good condenser microphones are very expensive to buy, but it is not beyond the capabilities of a mechanically minded amateur to manufacture quite a successful one. Ribbon Microphones These give exceptionally good quality and are easier to make than a condenser microphone. A full description is impossible here, but in principle the microphone consists of a small strip of aluminium foil suspended between the pole pieces of a powerful Fig. 17. A Crystal Microphone suitable for amateur equipments.A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 63 magnet. The output from the strip is stepped up by means of a transformer (ratio about 1 : 20) to an impedance suitable for operating into a line. The amplifier can then be placed in any convenient position and should have a grid input transformer similar to that used for a transverse current carbon microphone. The output, however, is much less than with this type and three stages of high magni fication are generally required in the amplifier. Microphone Amplifiers It will be observed from the foregoing remarks that all good quality microphones are very in sensitive, and we must therefore employ an amplifier to raise the level to a suitable value to drive the grid of the modulator valve. The usual practice followed in high quality low-frequency amplifier design is all that is required. Resistance coupling between the stages is advisable and the input transformer to the first stage must be suitable for the type of microphone employed. We must of course provide suitable volume control to enable the correct grid input to the modulator for full modulation to be obtained with various loudnesses of the sound. This volume control should preferably be inserted fairly “ early ” in the amplifier to avoid overloading the first stages. There is no reason why a screen grid valve should not be used for the first stage, provided that the anode resistance employed is small—preferably not more than about 25,000 ohms. One very important precaution to be taken is to prevent the introduction of radio frequencies from the transmitter into the microphone amplifier. This may be achieved by keeping the amplifier well away from the transmitter and completely screening it where possible. In this case it is advisable to use a step-down transformer from the amplifier to the line which connects it to the transmitter and a step- up transformer at the far end into the modulator grid. Considerable reduction of radio frequency pick-up can be obtained by the use of resistances of several thousand ohms in series with the grid. Fig. 19 is a typical circuit for a speech amplifier suitable for a transverse current microphone. It would also be suitable for a crystal microphone or a sensitive ribbon microphone if suitable input R!—400 ohms, 1 watt. R 2 —20,000 ohms, I watt. R 3 —15,000 ohms, j watt. R 4 —10,000 ohms, i watt. r 6 —100,000 ohms, i watt, r 6 —10,000 ohms, £ watt. r 7 —10,000 ohms, j watt. R 8 —1,200 ohms, i watt. Fig. 19.

With the usual type of ribbon microphone or condenser microphone a pre-amplifier would probably be necessary. The amplifier which is resistance-coupled through out has a screen grid valve in the first stage. Its anode circuit is well decoupled to prevent low- frequency back-coupling. \ 2 is a high magnification triode. The grid resistance of V 3 forms the gain control and should consist of a logarithmic low potentiometer if possible. If the amplifier is also intended for use with a microphone of larger output than the usual transverse current variety it would be advisable either to make R 5 a potentiometer or to reduce the anode resistance (R 2 ) of the first valve in order to prevent overloading the second. Adjustments The general adjustments required to get the best operating conditions of any particular type of modulator have been indicated in the description above. Considerable information can be gained however from the indications of the various meters in the circuit. Fig. 20. Circuit of Phone Monitor and Overmodulation Indicator. For example, the meters in the anode circuits of a microphone amplifier, which it is assumed employs Class A valves only, should never indicate any variation in anode current, if distortion is to be prevented. In the case of a push-pull Class A amplifier, slight kicks on high modulation may be permitted without serious distortion. The same remarks, of course, apply to Class A modulator valves which are really low-frequency power amplifying stages. When using Class B push-pull amplification, however, there will be no anode current unless modulation is taking place and the meters will, of course, flick upwards during modu lation The modulated Class C amplifier or linear Class B amplifier should also show no variation of anode current. If it does, it denotes that the amplifier is being overloaded, or that the correct operating conditions have not been arrived at. The aerial current will theoretically rise from its unmodulated value by 22-6 per cent, for full modulation with sine waves, but when transmitting speech or music, very little change will be observed. If, however, a downward movement of the meter is observed during modulation, the operating con ditions are incorrect. This is usually a sign of insufficient drive on the modulated stage, or perhaps incorrect grid bias. Monitoring The continuous monitoring of a telephony trans mitter is always advisable. This, of course, can be done on the station receiver, but unless it is well screened and contains an input radio frequency volume control, its detector is liable to be saturated and its output is no indication at all of the quality of transmission. It is also not permissible to listen to the harmonics of the transmission as is often done for C.W. A far better scheme is to use a separate monitor. This consists simply of a tuned circuit which feeds a diode detector or more conveniently a Westector. This tuned circuit is weakly coupled to the transmitter, and the D.C. in the circuit is measured by means of a milliammeter. Fig. 20 shows such a device. A pair of telephones can be jacked in and the quality of transmission judged by listening. A suitable detector is the Westector type W.6, but the coupling should not be increased beyond the point at which a current of 0-25 mA is obtained. If using a diode, this may consist of an ordinary triode with grid and anode strapped, but it has the disadvantage over the Westector that it needs an L.T. supply. It will operate more satisfactorily at the higher frequencies however. Modulation Measurement There are several methods by which the degree of modulation in a transmitter may be measured. When using choke modulation, an electrostatic voltmeter can be connected directly across the modulation choke. Knowing the unmodulated anode voltage of the Class C amplifier, we can calculate the modulation percentage as follows :— , , . choke volts modulation = X 141-I percent. amplifier volts It is, however, better to base our measurements on the actual R.F. output. The rise in aerial current is not a very good indication, and the use of a peak voltmeter is to be recommended. A suitable circuit is shown in Fig. 22. The potentio meter is varied until the anode current only just Fig. 21. A neat Phone Monitor (For Circuit, see Fig. 20.)A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 65 starts to flow, when the unmodulated carrier is applied. The voltmeter will then read, let us say, V, volts. Now modulate the transmitter steadily and readjust the potentiometer until the anode current again just starts to flow on the highest peaks. Suppose the voltmeter now reads V 2 volts, then modulation = ( ) X 100 per cent. In order to indicate overmodulation we can use the Westector circuit shown in Fig. 20. When the transmitter is correctly adjusted there will be no movement of the milliammeter with modulation less than 100 per cent., but should this figure be exceeded, the meter will flick upwards. Some such simple overmodulation indicator should be in use in all amateur transmitting stations to avoid interference with neighbouring receivers. MODULATED CARRIER Fig. 22. A Modulation Measuring Circuit. The Cathode Ray Oscillograph The cathode ray oscillograph forms a very useful tool for studying and checking the operation of radiotelephony transmitters. It is a device which will indicate visibly the actual waveform of the voltage in a circuit. As a result it is possible to apply it to a modulated radio-frequency circuit and obtain a picture on the screen similar to the diagrams in Figs. 7 and 14. With a carrier wave on any of the amateur bands the actual individual carrier oscillations will be so cramped up as to appear continuous and a solid picture of the modulation envelope shape will result. Such features as overmodulation can readily be detected. Fig. 23A illustrates the appearance of a carrier 100 per cent, modulated with a steady tone. In B is shown the waveshape observed when overmodulation occurs in an anode- modulated stage. F To obtain these images it is necessary to supply the vertical or Y-deflecting plates with the modulated R.F. from, say, the output tank circuit. The horizontal or X-plates are fed from the “ time-base ” circuit which should operate at about one-third or one-quarter of the modulation frequency. Another valuable method of using the cathode Fig. 23. Oscilloscope Images. A. 100 per cent, modulated wave. B. Overmodulated wave. C. Carrier only. D. Distortionless modulation less than 100 per cent. E. Distortionless 100 per cent, modulation. F. Non-linear modulation. ray tube is the production of the so-called “ trapezoidal ” figures. In this case the vertically deflecting plates are fed from R.F. voltage either through a small condenser from the tank-circuit or a coupled tuned circuit. The horizontally deflecting plates are connected to the same source as that used for modulating the transmitter. The shape of the figure so obtained indicates clearly the performance of the set. In Fig. 23C is shown the rectangular figure obtained with zero modulation. The figure becomes trapezoidal as in D when the modulation is applied and triangular when exactly 100 per cent, linear modulation is reached as in E. The percentage modulation may be obtained by measuring the height of the short and long ends of the figure. Calling these S and L respectively :— L — S Modulation = T g X 100 per cent. ~r o Curvature of the edges of the figure indicates non-linear modulation due to overloading or incorrect adjustment in one of the stages. There is insufficient space in this chapter to illustrate all the effects observable with an intelligently used cathode ray tube but enough will have been said to show its potentialities. There is a small oscilloscope known as the RCA.913 which is suitable for obtaining all the effects described above. It has the advantage of requiring only a few hundred volts to operate it. A larger tube known as the E.40-G.3 has been introduced by the Mullard Co. in this country which has the advantage of a 3-inch diameter screen on which the image can be made large enough for measurements of an accuracy sufficient for all amateur purposes. [Concluded on page 125.)CHAPTER SIX Power Supplies * D.C.—Rectified A.C.—Filters—Safety Devices B EFORE any decision can be made as to the type of transmitter which is to be employed, attention must be given to the all-important question of its power-supply. This will depend chiefly upon the availability or not of electric supply mains. For the Low-power Transmitter Generally speaking, where no public supply is available the amateur must content himself with a low-power outfit. There are several courses open in such circumstances, depending chiefly upon the expenditure permissible. For the very simplest low-power sets the ubiquitous dry battery holds its own. For example, with dry batteries totalling 300 volts from which a drain of 20mA or so is possible, six watts are available as input power, and with an efficient low-power set an amazing amount of work can be done using such a power. If H.T. accumulators are purchased, then the tyro will undoubtedly be able to put out a more reliable and possibly steadier signal. They have the advantage that, during discharge, they maintain a steady voltage very much better than the dry battery. An alternative for the man with no mains supply consists of the use of some form of rotary-converter to be used on a low-tension accumulator battery. This will generally be made up of a high voltage generator coupled to an electric motor driven by means of a 6-volt, or preferably 12-volt, car starter battery. Although more expensive, this method has the merit that large low-tension accumulators are generally easier to maintain in good condition and more easily transported to the local charging station than H.T. accumulators. Using the D.C. Mains For the intending transmitter who has a public electric supply at his command the prospect is, however, distinctly rosier. His high tension supply will not only cost him considerably less, but its flexibility and possibility of expansion to meet later needs will be much greater. The supply will be one of two kinds. If it is Direct Current there is immediately available an almost perfect power supply for the low-power transmitter, since most D.C. mains are between 200 and 240 volts. Any lower voltage can easily be obtained by potentio meter and series resistance circuits such as are used i n ordinary receiver practice. Generally speaking, a public D.C. supply is not suitable for direct connection to the transmitter, however. Its voltage will be varying very slightly many times a second, producing what is known as a “ ripple ” voltage. It is necessary to use what is known as a ' filter ” or smoothing circuit in order to remove this. + D.C. _ MAINS L Z c z 4- HT Z c SUPPLY Fig. I. Filter circuit for D.C. Mains. Such an arrangement is shown in Fig. 1. L is an iron-cored choke which should be some 5 henries or more when carrying the current which the trans mitter will take. Its resistance should preferably be as low as convenient. The condensers C should be, say, 2 p.F each, of a working voltage equal at least to that of the mains and preferably greater. A filter of this type will provide a smooth, unvarying supply to the transmitter. Without it considerable hum would probably be heard at the back of the transmitted speech or music, or a ripple would be heard superimposed upon telegraphic signals. Sometimes improved results are obtained by putting the choke in the negative lead, or even one in each as shown in Fig. 2. As some transmitter circuits are connected to earth at the negative H.T. terminal it is always advisable to put a non-inductive condenser of, say, 0-1 p.F capacity in the earth lead of any transmitter working from D.C. mains. This is because the supply authority generally forbids earthing the supply mains, and in any case the positive main is sometimes earthed. In the latter case, of course, the main would be short-circuited when an earth connection is put on the negative H.T. terminal on the transmitter. In all cases where mams are employed it is essential to protect the circuit with suitable fuses. In the case of D.C. mains there should be one in each mains lead before the filter. A three-amp. fuse would be ample for the average transmitter. In the case of A.C. mains circuits described below where a transformer is used the fuses should again be directly in the mains lead, that is to say in the primary circuit. 1 « * 66A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 67 Small circuit-breakers can now be easily obtained. These are very suitable for protecting the main supply to the transmitter. Not only can they be set to the required tripping current but they can be immediately closed again, thus avoiding any long delay in a transmission while fuses are being replaced. If a higher voltage is required than that of the mains it will be necessary to use a motor driving a high-tension generator, as there is no convenient method for “ stepping-up ” D.C. mains voltage directly. o- + DC. MAINS ^innrnm + H.T Soppuy Fig. 2. Filter circuit using two chokes. A.C. Supply Finally we must consider the case where an Alternating Current supply is available. This presents both advantages and disadvantages. In the first case we can employ a power transformer, which will change the voltage to any required value. We can, for example, step the voltage up as high as we require for our H.T. supply and also step it down to supply the low-voltage filament current for the transmitter valves. The disadvantage lies in the fact that the polarity of the voltage is changing over many times in one second, at the “ frequency ” of the supply in fact. Since a trans mitter must always have its valve anodes main tained positive with respect to the filaments we have to “ rectify ” the A.C. V Fundamental circuit of thermionic rectifier. A simple rectifying circuit is given in Fig. 3. The two valves (VV) shown are known as “ half-wave ” rectifiers. In low-voltage circuits these two valves are often enclosed in a single bulb as in rectifiers f2 for receiver H.T. supplies such as the Marconi U14 or U18. The filaments are lit from a step-down transformer T 2 , and the anodes from a step-up transformer T,. These are shown as separate transformers, but in low-power sets may actually be made as one transformer, using a common primary winding. If the filament winding has no centre tap this lead may be taken directly to one end of the winding. The rectifiers will only pass current when their anodes are positive and with the arrangement of Fig. 3 one valve will pass current during one half cycle and the other valve during the next and so on. In Fig. 4, curve A represents the primary voltage applied to the transformer. Each half of the secondary applies a charging voltage in turn to the condenser C 1 of Fig. 3 through its respective rectifier. If there were no load on the rectifier the condenser voltage would rise to the peak value of one half the secondary voltage. The load, however, partially discharges the condenser nearest to the rectifier (C 1 ) before the next charging impulse arrives. The waveshape of the voltage across this condenser (generally called the “reservoir” con denser) is shown in curve B. Fig. 4. Wave shapes. The ripple voltage is removed by the inductance and final condenser C , which forms a filter of the type illustrated in Fig. 2. The output is thus substantially a steady D.C., as shown in curve C. A single inductance filter of the Fig. 1 type can often be used very successfully. It will be readily appreciated that if the reservoir condenser is too small the load will discharge it too far before the next charging pulse arrives. This produces a large ripple voltage. Too large a value causes charging currents which are greater than the valve can handle safely. A usual value is 4 fxF for voltages of the order of 500 or less. For higher voltage outputs a smaller size is permissible. The degree of filtering required for rectifier circuits is much greater than for D.C. main supplies. Since the value of Cj is limited by the foregoing considerations, the values of L and C 2 must be made large enough to obtain the necessary smoothing. The cutoff frequency, i.e. the ripple frequency above which the filter is effective in smoothing, is equal to [xF- , . _ where L and C„ are in henries and 7t a/LCj L is the total inductance of both68 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO chokes when one in each side is used. This should be as low a frequency as possible and certainly not greater than the freqnencv of the mains supply- For small rectifiers up to 500 volts output good smoothing is obtained, using an inductance of some 20 henries with a condenser (C ) of 4 pF. The condensers used should have a working voltage of at least 50 per cent, greater than the maximum D.C. output voltage. Ihe inductance of a smoothing choke may fall considerably when a direct current flows through it, and it is necessary to see that the required- value of inductance is obtainable at the maximum working Current. Information on the design and construc tion of chokes will be found in the T. &amp;R. Bulletin, March, April, and June, 1931. Mercury Vapour Rectifiers Ordinary thermionic two-electrode valves are suitable for any voltage up to 1,000, but the hot- cathode mercury vapour rectifier is now becoming common. These valves are very much more efficient. The Os ram GU5 half-wave rectifier. Rating 1 000 V 0.25 A. s . For example, the Osram GU5 or the Ediswan M.U1 will supply 250 mA at 1,000 v. (0-25 kilowatt) wxth a voltage drop of 15 volts only. The valve is in the same size bulb as an ordinary receiving valve. The chief point to notice, however, is that the fila ment which requires 2 amps, at 4 volts must be warmed up for a minute or so before switching on the H.T. It is necessary therefore to use a separate transformer for this purpose. Swnxnes which will automatically close the H.T. circuit after a suitable delay are obtainable at quite a low figure. A typical example manufactured by the Varley Co. is illustrated. When switching off the transmitter temporarily, as for example when receiving, the rectifier filaments may be left alight - J V-.IIUKC input niters us i n g GUI or MU1 rectifiers a slight different form of filter to that given in Fig 3 desirable. Every pulse of A.C. from the H.T tran former charges the first or “ reservoir ” condense through the valve. If the valve has a moderate; high anode impedance, such as has a thermion rect fier, this chargmg current will not be excessiv providing, of course, that the maker’s recommended condenser value is not exceeded. In the case of the mercury rectifier, however, the internal impedance is very low indeed, and it is preferable to use what is termed a choke input filter. In this circuit (Fig. 5) the first element of the filter is an inductance of such a size as to limit the condenser charging pulses to a reasonable value. Fig. 5. A simple choke input Alter. By using a choke of a type which has a very high inductance when the load current is small and which falls when the current rises, excellent regulation of the rectifier can be obtained. That is to say, the output voltage will be nearly constant for all currents up to full load. I his feature of good regulation is becoming of great importance now that Class B modulators and controlled-carrier transmitters are coming into general use. In such circuits the D.C. anode current varies from instant to instant depending upon the degree of modulation. If the power supply has a high resistance, i.e. poor regulation, the voltage will vary as the load varies. Any unsteadiness in the voltage applied to the anode circuit will introduce distortion. I he circuit given in Fig. 5 is suitable for supplying mj ^ 1-000 volts using two GUI’s or GUo s. The following component values will give good results :— Condenser (C) Inductance of choke (at 25 mA) Inductance of choke (at 250 mA) Resistance (R) The resistance R serves the purpose of preventic the current from falling below 25 mA, and also f 3 pi 501 51 40,000 ohm A popular delay switch for use with mercury vapour rectifier.A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 69 0 *. discharge the condenser completely when the power switched off. F urther details of this type of circuit will be found in the T. jR. Bulletin for October, 1935. Where an automatic delay switch is used for closing the H.T. transformer circuit, this should be of a type suitable for operation at the filament voltage and connected as shown in Fig. 6. Where high voltages are being used it is preferable to operate the delay switch either from a separate 4-volt transformer or a winding supplying filament current to one of the transmitter valves. In this way the insulation between the heating resistance and the contacts is not subject to such a high strain In Fig. 6 a further stage of smoothing filter has been added. The values are chosen as indicated earlier. Power Supplies Giving Several Voltages Fortunately, the valves in a transmitter which take most current require, in general, less smoothing than the early stages such as crystal oscillators, etc. For such a multi-stage set it is more economical to employ a separate filter for these stages which can have higher inductances designed to carry less current. In many cases the voltage required for such stages will be considerably less, in which case a completely separate rectifier and filter would, of course, be employed. If the H.T. transformer has suitable tappings several rectifiers and filters may be fed from the same transformer as shown in Fig. 7. Here the 1,000-volt supply is rectified by the mercury rectifiers and an ordinary full-wave rectifier, for example, the U14, draws its H.T. supply from the 500-volt tappings. Thus we have available 1,000 volts for the final stages of the transmitter together with, perhaps, the modulator, while the 500-volt supply can be used to feed the frequency doublers, etc. Keying The method of keying the set is bound up to a certain extent with the H.T. supply. When dry Input smoothing filter. batteries or H.T. accumulators are used the main H.T. circuit should be keyed as this will economise considerably in the life of the batteries. Where rectifiers and especially rotary machines are used H.T. keying is not to be recommended as the voltage will rise when the load is removed and cause surges and possibly a “ chirpy ” note, particularly if the transmitter is not of the crystal-controlled type. The effect of using poor power supplies in keyed circuits has been discussed in detail in Chapter 5. Fig. 7. A power circuit giving two separate H.T. supplies from a single H.T. transformer. Safety Devices It must be remembered that even a few hundred volts can cause quite unpleasant physiological effects if carelessly handled. There is no reason for the amateur to be unnecessarily perturbed, however, provided that a few simple precautions are taken. Firstly, always connect a red pilot lamp across the primary of all H.T. transformers. This should preferably be a neon lamp to lessen the possibility of a burnt-out lamp which is, of course, a source of great potential danger. Failing this, a red 15-watt sign lamp may be used. The possibility of its failing is greatly reduced by using, say, a 250-volt lamp on mains of 200 to 240 volts, thus increasing the life of the lamp. In all cases where voltages above, say, 250 are being used it is advisable to connect a resistance across the smoothing condenser nearest the trans mitter of such a value as to pass, say, 10% of the full load current. If then the transmitter filaments happen to be switched off before the H.T. rectifier, this will discharge the filter condensers and remove the possibility of dangerous shocks. Since, as in the case of the pilot lamp, the safety of the operator may depend upon its correct functioning, it is always desirable to use a resistance with a wattage rating at least double that actually consumed.

Introduction T HE design of the aerial system is of the utmost importance in a transmitting station, for if it has not the ability to radiate usefully, the power supplied by the transmitter is wasted. The difference between a good and a bad aerial system can be as great as a hundredfold difference in transmitter power. The efficiency of a transmitter or receiver can be observed quite easily, but the radiation from an aerial cannot be seen, and its efficiency can only be determined by patient trial over a long period, through contact with other stations. A proper understanding of the principles of aerial design will therefore save much time and trouble. Briefly, the problem is to transfer all the R.F. power output of the transmitter to the aerial system, whence it must all be radiated in certain desirable directions, without local absorption of the radiated energy. Sometimes uniform radiation in all direc tions is desired, often it is required to be directive ; it may be required to work for small or for very great distances, or both ; the same aerial may have to work on several amateur bands. An experi menter’s ambition in these directions is often seriously hindered by the space available. Theory of Operation Aerial systems have tuning properties, even as the tuning circuits of the transmitter and receiver, and are, in effect, open oscillating circuits, the only fundamental difference being one of scale. In order to radiate well, the aerial must be of appreciable dimensions compared with the wavelength of operation ; the tuned circuits of the transmitter however, are small and confined, and therefore do not radiate appreciably. Simple aerials fall into two classes, the Marconi and the Hertz. The difference between the two is a simple one, but it is of fundamental importance in understanding the design and operation of trans mitting aerials. In the Marconi a wire of indefinite length is used in conjunction with either counterpoise wires or an earth connection, and the system is brought into tune with the transmitting frequency by means of a coil in series. This coil is the source of coupling to the transmitter, and is either series or parallel tuned, depending on the wavelength and the physical dimensions of the system. The operation of the Hertz aerial is based on the fact that the wavelength to which any wire will tune depends directly upon its length. The radiator is thus self-tuned and no earth or counterpoise is necessary, so that it can be placed where it is less disturbed by the ground, buildings, etc., and so is more efficient. Short wave aerials are all developed from the Hertz type, because of its greater efficiency, and because the lengths of wire involved are convenient. On the longer wavebands, however, some type of Marconi is more common, in spite of lower efficiency, because the lengths of wire required for a Hertz are too great. First, the reader must have in his mind a clear idea of what happens when an aerial is energised from a R.F. source, as is the case when an aerial system is coupled to a transmitter. Perhaps the best way to visualise the phenomena under discussion is to perform some experiment which will illustrate them. Take a fairly heavy cord, such as a thick sash-cord, about 20 ft. long (the longer the better) and fix it to something solid with an elastic joint. Pull it fairly tight from the far end, and wave it gently. The illustration will be easier if the rope is hung vertically downwards. A frequency of waving at which the rope assumes a steady and violent oscillation (the centre waving back and forth) will soon be found. This can be maintained with quite a gentle pull provided it is at the right speed and at the correct instants. This oscillation is an exact analogy to an electrical oscillation in a resonant wire. If you wave too slowly you will find that you cannot transmit much power to the rope, as the source (your arm) is now out of tune with the resonant frequency of the rope. Now a study of the motion will reveal that the rope has maximum velocity, and consequentlv maximum energy of motion at the centre when it is passing through the “ straight ” position. You will also find that you are pulling hardest at the end when it is at each extremity of a swing. At this point the rope is coming to rest and reversing, and at the instant of reversal it has no energy of motion ; all the energy of the system is now in the form of a. force at the ends. . c cuer &amp;y 01 motion corre sponds to the current in an aerial wire, whilst the force you are applying represents the electrical force or voltage at the ends. Notice also that you ar ® a PP 1 y in g alternate pulls in opposite directions sideways, corresponding to the opposite directions “ 0 V° n t ^ le centre , but a quarter of a period of oscillation out of step with the maximum velocity at the centre. In an exactly similar way, the sequence in an aerial carrying electric oscillations 1S vo ta S e (+ force), + current (+ motion), — ^ ^ T f° rce )&gt; aiK f — current (— motion), and so lortn, and the energy alternates between the ends and centre twice per complete period. 70A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 71 You could equally well supply the energy to maintain the oscillation by moving the centre or some intermediate point, fixing both ends elastically, but you would find yourself supplying energy of motion at the centre, and some proportion of each at intermediate points. In a similar way a resonant aerial can be supplied at any point; if at the end, it is supplied chiefly with force or voltage, and is then said to be “ voltage fed ” ; if at the centre, it is supplied chiefly with current and is then called “ current fed The ratio of the voltage at any point to the current at the same point is called the 'impedance”, and it will obviously vary from a high value at the free end to a low one at the centre. The dotted line in Fig. I represents the voltages in a wire AB at any given time instant. With maximum voltage at the points V, there is maximum current at the point C where voltage is minimum, and as we found with the rope, the voltage and current maxima are out of step in time as well as in space. v A B V Fig. 1. Wire operating on Its fundamental frequency—half-wave or Hertz. Returning to the rope, suppose you wave it at twice the original speed; you will find that a second mode of oscillation can occur, with two loops swinging. At three times the frequency three waves may be made to appear, and so on. Notice that at any instant adjacent loops are moving in opposite directions. In electrical terms they are said to be in opposite phase, and oscillations of this type are also possible in an aerial, when it is said to be on its fundamental frequency, or at its second or third harmonic, according as there are one, two or three current “ loops ” or maxima. V Fig. 2. Wire operating on its second harmonic (full wave). In Fig. 2 we see a system oscillating in its second mode, or at its second harmonic. The points V are still the points of maximum voltage, whilst C and C 1 are the points of maximum current. The wire of Fig. 2 carries a complete cycle of operations, and since the distance between th£ crests is a whole wavelength this is called a full-wave oscillation. In Fig. 1, however, we have only half a cycle, and this wire is said to have a half-wave resonance. If the length of the wire AB is the same in both cases, then the wire of Fig. 2 is excited at twice the frequency, or half the wavelength, of that in Fig. 1. In the same way the wire may carry any number of complete half-waves. Another fact which may emerge from experi ments with the rope is that the shorter the rope the higher the frequency, and vice versa. The frequency of resonance of an aerial wire is related to its length in exactly the same way, but it is often found more convenient to talk in terms of wavelength when dealing with aerials, since the direct wavelength proportion is easier to use than the inverse frequency relationship. The actual proportion is that the wire is half a wavelength long for its fundamental resonance. Oscillations of this type are called standing waves and occur in any efficient radiating system, be it a rope, a piano string, or an organ pipe executing air vibrations. In order to understand how they are formed, a further experiment may be made with the rope. Pull it tight and give it one sharp flick. You will see a little wave run down the rope to the far end, and then come back to you and you will feel the energy of the wave. The wave was reflected at the far end, and you may also have noticed a further reflection when it reached your hand. When the impulses supplied at your end are timed so as to allow one transit of the rope, then the large standing waves which you observed previously are built up. Bearing in mind that the wavelength is equal to the velocity divided by the frequency, and that the velocity of a wave in a wire is the same as in free space, it will easily be realised that in a half wave length of wire a wave starting from one end will just arrive back at the home end in one complete period, and will thus be in step with the feeding source. The remarkably convenient tuning property of an aerial wire is thus explained. Radiation and Radiation Resistance It is not possible here to give a complete account of how the energy leaves the aerial, but it may be noted that the fundamental requirement is the presence of a standing wave system on the wire. As the energy moves about on the wire as described above, alternating between the voltage and the current forms, electric and magnetic strains in the surrounding medium do not interchange in quite the same way. Because of the finite velocity of propagation of these strains they do not follow the oscillations in the wire exactly, but get left behind, so to speak. Each interchange of current and voltage in the wire therefore causes a quantity of energy, in the form of a system of electric and magnetic forces, to be left behind in space. These are pushed out by the forces due to the next oscillation, and thus travel outward into space. Obviously, the greatest energy will be radiated when the forces are greatest, that is, when the current and voltage are greatest. The power radiated by an aerial may be repre sented by the square of the current at any point multiplied by a fictitious resistance placed at the same point and commonly known as the radiation resistance. At the centre of a half-wave this has a value around 80 ohms, so that a current of one ampere in the centre of such an aerial would represent about 80 watts of radiated power. In the case of a full wave aerial the radiation resistance at one loop (J-wave from end) due to the whole aerial— 72 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO is usually more hke 1U0 ohms. At the ends the apparent radiation resistance is of the order of several thousand ohms, and intermediate values are given by intermediate points. It is usual to refer the radiation resistance to a point of maximum current in the standing wave system in the wire. In the Hertz or harmonic aerial the radiation resistance is high compared with the wire resistance, and the efficiency high : in the short Marconi the radiation resistance is very low, and appreciable power is lost in heating the wire. The Marconi Aerial On the 1-7 Me (160 metre) band, and also usually on 3-5 Me (80 metres), it is seldom possible to erect a Hertz aerial, and some form of Marconi Fig. 3. Vertical quarter-wave Aerial, showing “image* effects. In many cases the available wire length is rather less than a quarter-wave ; in this case the aerial may be brought to resonance (maximum current at earth connection) by using a loading inductance, and perhaps a tuning condenser across the latter if the aerial is much too small. This is showm in Fig. 4b. Harmonic Aerials When the aerial is a little too long, a condenser can be used in series with the coupling coil. Fig. 4c, but where the aerial is much too long it will probably be better to use a harmonic aerial. Instead of using a quarter-wave aerial to get the current maximum at the earth connection, the same purpose would be served by using an aerial of length equal to three quarter-wavelengths, or five, or any odd multiple of a quarter-wavelength. For example, an aerial of length 25 metres (about 82 ft.) is just a little short of three quarter-wavelengths for a 40-metre trans mitter, and a small coil and parallel condenser would tune it to this three-quarter-wave position. The voltage and current distribution in the aerial would then be as shown in Fig. 4d. Harmonic aerials are not suitable for short waves unless there are several complete half-waves in the system, because the radiation is sent off at too high an angle. The ' long ” one approximates to a long horizontal aerial and can be very effective, though it has been found advisable to avoid having the bend at a voltage maximum. ^ wucie a vert] quarter-wave of wire is represented. The curr and voltage distributions are shown, and the v is assumed to be earthed at the bottom. Now observer at the point P would be able to receive t waves from any point A on the wire, one direef and the other by reflection from the ground at Now extending the line PB, you will see that so as P 1S concerned, the reflected wave appears a\ e originated at A lt and not A, exactly as if 1 ground level were a mirror. As this holds for a position of A, it follows that the half-wave of w is virtually completed by an image of the n quarter-wave, as shown. T , Xhi l ^ th f fundamental type of Marconi aeri The shortest length which will permit maximi current at the base and maximum voltage at t top with of course the greatest efficiency, is t quarter-wave. This is shown in Fig. 4a. If this quarter-wave aerial is fed at the earth en the conditions require a large current and a 1c voltage, a very low resistance.

Marconi Aerials, showing feed methods.A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO is usually of high resistance, and to overcome the loss of efficiency due to this, a system of wires known as a counterpoise is employed in place of, or in conjunction, with the earth. The counterpoise should extend as far as the aerial, but need not of necessity be under it. It is best from the point of view of efficiency to arrange matters so that the portion of the system which is the electrical centre and carries the maximum current is in the centre of the coupling coil, and if this cannot be arranged by adjusting the length of the counterpoise it can be done by the use of series condensers in the aerial and counterpoise leads, as well as the parallel one across the coupling d:oil. The two series condensers are adjusted so that when the third is tuned for maximum loading of the transmitter, maximum current occurs at the centre of the coil and also in the aerial lead-in. When using the 3-5 Me (80 metre) band, the same aerial system which was parallel tuned for 1*7 Me (160 metres) will often need to be series tuned as it is longer than a half-wave for this band, and often, too, the same size coupling coil may be employed. To get an idea of the size of this coil, a rough rule is that it contains about half the length of wire which would be required to make the aerial system up to a whole half-wave total length. The Hertz Aerial As the wavelength to which a wire will tune (its fundamental wavelength) is twice its length in metres, an aerial 21 metres long (approximately 66ft.) has a fundamental wavelength of, roughly, 42 metres. Such a wire is therefore half-wave in the 7 Me band and full-wave on 14 Me. On 3-5 Me (80 metres) it would be quarter-wave, but the radiation efficiency would be very low, since it would not be operating as a Hertz. On 80 metres, about 132 ft. of wire would be required; that is, twice 66 ft. The exact resonant frequency of any wire is, however, somewhat affected by its location, and the required length for a given frequency varies in different cases, depending on the proximity of the aerial to trees, buildings, and so on. Normally, a Hertz will radiate with practically equal effective ness within plus or minus 1 per cent, of its resonant frequency, so that this is not of great importance in ordinary working. Under practical conditions it is usually necessary to use an aerial of a length suitable to give resonance at a definite frequency. That is, suppose the transmitter to be crystal-controlled at 7-100 Me th*j aerial must be designed accordingly. The formula below is that used for the calcu lations. Length = X K. where F is the frequency in Me and K is a factor depending on the physical arrangement of the system. If the wire is thin compared to the wave length, and the aerial is at least a half wavelength clear of any other objects of any size, such as trees and buildings, K = 95 per cent., and this will be good for any wire up to about 12 S.W.G., for frequencies of 14 Me and lower. For the two highest bands the factor will be nearer 93 per cent. if heavy wire is used. Thus in the case chosen, where F is 7-100 Me, the length comes to 65-9 ft., and 66 ft. will be near enough for practical purposes. The length is measured to the far ends of the loops of wire round the insulators. If the aerial comes within a quarter-wavelength of buildings or trees, K will often be nearer 93 per cent., but it is best to use the first figure given as a starting point, and then check up the tuning as described later. In some varieties of the Hertz which are symmetrical about the centre, it may happen that one end comes near an earthed body, in which case it is better to do the trimming at that end only. Thus, in the case chosen, if one end were well clear, but the other end came within 10 ft. of a roof, it might give a better balance in a symmetrically-fed aerial if the end near the roof were shortened by as much as 6 inches, or proportionally for other frequencies. Long Radiators A development of the Hertz is the long wire containing a number of complete half-waves. Such an aerial can be much more powerful in some respects, as will be discussed later. The formula for the resonant length changes from that given, to 4Q2 L = -j^(« — 05) feet where n is the number of complete half-waves and the factor in brackets replaces the old K. It will be seen that the length is never quite the full length 492 of the half-waves (which would be —g^) but approaches it as n increases. This is due to the fact that the wave on the wire travels slightly slower than the wave in space, and it will be seen that if a wire is cut for 4 half-waves on 14-2 Me then it will be slightly too long for two half-waves on 7 • 1 Me and a little further out for 3-55 Me. This is a slight handicap when it is desired to use the aerial on several bands. In such cases it is best to cut the length to suit the highest frequency or for the one where greatest effect is required. In some methods of feeding the aerial it is important, in others not, as will be shown. Feeders or Transmission Lines By the use of devices known as feeders or trans mission lines, the energy of the transmitter may be carried a great distance without appreciable loss either in the device, or by radiation. It is then possible to place the radiating element in a position where it may be used to maximum advantage. For example, the Hertz radiator may be only 33 ft. long (14 Me), yet it can be placed as high as 100 ft. and supplied efficiently. On the other hand, if it were necessary to bring part of the radiator to the transmitter, most of this valuable height would be lost, and the radiated power would be partly lost in the building and might also be sent in an un suitable direction. The use of a feeder thus allows us to control the behaviour of the aerial more easily because it can be placed and oriented as desired. There are three main types of feeder. The first consists of a pair of parallel wires a small fraction of a wavelength apart (a few inches) and is often called a twin or balanced feeder. At any point along the feeder the currents in the two wires are equal in value but opposite in sign, and as the wires are close together the radiation from them cancels out. v Counterpoise The earth i74 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO G2NO H K ADAMS WEBBS LONDON BRITAIN’S LEADING SHORT-WAVE STORE COMMUNICATION TYPE RECEIVERS R M E 69 1938 Model • Six Band Tuning : 9 to 550 metres. • Calibrated Microvolt R.

I G6VA 'PHONE GEPRAPD 208976 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO v This feeder may be operated in either of two ways : it may have equal and opposite ' standing waves ” along it, in which case it is called a tuned feeder, and the distribution of current and voltage is as shown in Fig. 5. Such an arrangement needs to be tuned at the bottom end so as to accommodate a definite number of quarter-waves. It is possible, on the other hand, to arrange matters so that current and voltage are distributed uniformly all along, and there are no standing waves, in which case the feeder is said to be “ matched.” The matching is done by making the load at the far end have such a value that it absorbs energy just as fast as the feeder supplies it, when there can be no reflection, as in the case of the aerial, and thus no standing waves. It is always possible to produce a transformer effect in the aerial so that the radiation resistance is stepped up to the required value, and in some of the types illustrated this is done. A matched feeder is always preferable to a tuned It is not very easy to represent the behaviour of feeders with rope experiments, as it is difficult to do the load matching in a mechanical circuit, but you may easily approximate a long unmatched feeder by freeing the far end of the rope and laying it along the ground, when you can send waves along it which are not reflected back, but are attenuated progressively, or in the electrical case absorbed by the feeder. The value of the resistance which matches the feeder is known as the characteristic or surge impedance, and connection of such a load to one end gives the feeder the peculiar property that it appears to have the same resistance at the other end, whatever its length. It may thus be regarded as bringing the load resistance to the ' home ” end provided it is matched. The actual value of the surge impedance of a feeder depends on the ratio of wire diameter to wire spacing, and the graph of Fig. 7 shows how the impedance of parallel wires varies. It will be noticed that almost any feeder one is likely to construct falls between about 400 and 800 ohms. In one of the aerials shown here the design is given for a 600 ohm feeder, and this is a convenient size, striking the best compromise between weight and losses. It can be built with two 16 S.W.G. wires spaced 5 in. apart by wooden or glass rods about every 3 ft. along its length. If other gauges of wire are used with the same spacing the impedance will, of course, be different. The surge impedance of a concentric type of feeder is given by Z 0 = 138 Log 10 Outer radius Inner radius ohms. If there is solid insulating material between the conductors, this expression must be divided by the square root of its dielectric constant, and the velocity of the wave in the line will also be reduced by the same amount, an important point to remember w'hen estimating the length of a quarter or half-wave section of feeder. The impedance of a concentric feeder is typically much lower than that of a balanced pair, and such can be easily made with a characteristic impedance of about 50 to 100 ohms, suitable for direct connection in the centre of a half-wave aerial. The single wire line, however, is generally higher in impedance, and cannot be easily estimated. It is between 800 and 1,000 ohms, but usually varies along the wire as it approaches the ground. one from the point of view of efficiency. In com mercial practice matched feeders are commonly made 1,000 ft. long without serious loss, but an unmatched One must not be many quarter-waves long. The second type of feeder also has two conductors, the second conductor forming a tube round the other. Flexible varieties of concentric feeders are now becoming available for amateur use. In the third type, use is made of the earth for the second conductor, and so is called a single wire feeder. This type can only be regarded as a feeder when it is matched, and to do this is much more difficult than in the case of the twin feeder. It is not recommended for the beginner, though examples of its use are given later. Construction of Twin Feeders The construction of such feeders is not difficult, and with a little care the losses can be made very low. Enamelled wire is to be preferred as the oxidation of bare wire causes its resistance to rise slightly in time. The separators are cut from dowel which is quite cheap, and a small hole (about No. 48 morse size) is drilled near each end. The rods are then cooked in paraffin wax ; 1 lb. of wax will treat enough spacers for any amateur station. The wax must not be boiled hard, but just kept near the boiling point, for not only will it oxidise and lose its insulating value, but it is also very liable to catch fire. When the rods are well impregnated they are removed with pliers and left to get stone cold, after which they are given a quick dip in someA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO just molten wax. This will produce a thick adherent coat of wax which will make them last for years instead of months. The wax will prevent the water from staying on, and soaking into the wood. Short lengths of 20 S.W.G. wire are now inserted in the holes and used for binding the feeder wires across the ends. Such a feeder will withstand the roughest winds, as it is very light and swings as a unit, whereas one using heavy spacers will not, but will bend at each joint and rapidly disintegrate. It is recommended to standardise on the 600 ohm line, as most practical information, regarding taps, matching conditions, and general adjust ment, is given in terms of this, and in some cases only applies if a 600 ohm line is used. If the feeder is transposed every few feet, its impedance may be reckoned about 10 per cent, lower than that given by the formula on the chart. 800 700 600 500 400 300 - p 200 IOO 1-0 2 3 4 5 6 0 IO SEPARATION (D) INCHES. Fig. 6. Characteristic Impedance of Twin Feeders. There is now a variety of twin feeders available from Belling and Lee which consists of a pair of wires moulded in high quality dielectric. This has a low characteristic impedance suitable for direct connec tion in the centre of a half-wave aerial, but it should not be used in the centre of a full wave or similar places where the impedance is high, as no energy will be transferred at the mismatch. Twin flex or better high grade “ cab-tyre ” twin may be used, but these materials like the previous example, have low impedances and lower velocity. In wet weather they are liable to change impedance and also have greater loss; they should, therefore, not be used in damp places or in great lengths. These remarks apply particularly to lighting flex. The characteristic impedance of these is likely to be between 200 and 100 ohms. A match of impedance to the aerial is often obtained by untwisting one to two feet where the feeder joins the aerial and splaying slightly. No definite rule for this adjustment can be given as flexes vary. The chief advantage to be obtained from this type of feeder is in reception. Since the feeder is twisted it does not pick up any radiations and thus is a great help in reducing some types of local interference which are strongest near the ground. This type can definitely not be used when the top is full-wave, but only when it is one or three half waves, and for reception it is better to cut it short than to run into the full wave condition. A better system which may be used has a feeder of two wires which are transposed every few feet. Suitable insulators for this purpose may be purchased, and are known as “ Transposition blocks.” The ' End Fed ” Aerial Probably the simplest way to energise an aerial is that shown in Fig. 7a where one end of the wire (which may be any number of half-waves) is brought up to a tuned circuit which is directly coupled to the aerial. The wire could, of course, be connected directly to the anode circuit of the P.A. stage, but this is very bad practice as it allows the radiation of harmonics and any spurious frequencies which may be in the transmitter, key clicks, and so forth, which can cause interference in local broadcast receivers, whilst the harmonics can cause serious trouble elsewhere. With the separate circuit the transmitter is also likely to behave much more satisfactorily. To adjust the circuit, the anode condenser is tuned for minimum feed in the usual way, and the aerial coil, very loosely coupled, is tuned until it “ draws ” current in the P.A. The aerial is then tapped in and the coupling increased until the load is up to the optimum which has already been found with an artificial aerial (see Chaps. 4 and 13). It may be necessary to try a few taps before satisfaction is obtained. The aerial coil should be big enough to tune with about 50pp.F. If the system refuses to operate a different type of earth connection may be tried, or the length of the aerial changed slightly. This type of aerial is very suitable when the transmitter is located at the top of a building, the “ earth ” being the largest metal object available, such as the w r ater cistern or the mains sheathing, or a lead roof. A direct earth may be long enough to become resonant, but can be series tuned. Fig. 7. Coupling an “ End-fed ” Aerial78 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO A link coupling may be used in cases where it is not possible to bring the end of the aerial to the transmitter (Fig. 7b). This is a system which can be made to feed the same wire on several bands, as the difference in length for the various bands can be tuned out, or inserted easily. If the wire is too long it will call for more capacity in the circuit to which it is coupled, if too short it will call for less. The difference is such that a wire which is half-wave on 7 Me will be up to two feet short for the second harmonic. Fig. 8. The Zeppelin Aerial. The Zeppelin Aerial This very popular arrangement is illustrated in Fig. 8. The radiating portion AB is any desired number of half wavelengths long and is erected in a position as high and as clear as possible, and a pair of feeder wires runs up to one end in the manner shown. To ensure correct excitation and minimum radiation off the feeder it must be correctly dimensioned. The two wires run parallel to each other, a distance of 6-12' apart, and are spaced at intervals with wooden or glass spreaders. This feeder has standing waves on it and can be regarded as a Hertz folded back on itself. It is rather difficult to couple to the transmitter if it is an exact number of half-waves long at any of the frequencies used, and this length should be avoided. The chart in Fig. 9 shows possible lengths of feeder for two bands, and also the method of tuning the coupling The best adjustment of the aerial does not give equal currents in the two feeders. To adjust remove the top AB (Fig. 9), and support the feeder in position. Couple the circuit EC very loosely to the transmitter and tune to resonance, which will be sharp. Then connect the top. Resonance will now be flat, and coupling may need to be made tighter; the correct length of top will bring the resonance to the original tuning point on the condenser of EC. The best results are usually obtained by making the feeders one quarter-wave long and series tuning them. If the aerial is to be used on two or more bands this is not possible, and a suitable length must be picked off the chart, Fig 9, to avoid the half-wavelength on any of these bands. The aerial will, however, work quite well on other bands than that for which the top is correct, tuning being adjusted for equal currents in the two feed wires. For operation on lower frequency bands, where the aerial is no longer a half-wave, the side DE of the feeder may be disconnected, and the remainder of the system connected with a counterpoise or earth to make a Marconi aerial. Single Wire Feeds When an aerial is in resonance the impedance at any point is resistive, varying from a low value at the current maximum to high at the voltage maximum. There is thus some point at which it will match the impedance of a single wire feeder so that radiation from the feeder is prevented and only takes place from the aerial proper. When the “ top ” is half wave long (Fig. 10) the aerial is sometimes called a “ Windom ”, but the top may be any resonant length. This type is attractive for its simplicity of con struction but difficult to adjust. The determination of roof-length and feeder tapping point are inter dependent and the system is complicated theore tically and practically. Theoretically, because the correct functioning of the aerial depends on the exact length of wire being obtained for a given frequency with the tapping accurately fixed in relation, the essential feature of the ” Windom ” being that it must be energised at its exact response frequency, whereas practically, as already stated, the actual resonant frequency of any Hertz is affected by local conditions. Further, unless the roof-length and tapping point are correctly deter mined for the gauge of wire used, the feeder itself will radiate and affect the operation of the whole arrangement. Note that there is no second wire to neutralise radiation off the live arm ; in fact, the difficulty of preventing the feeder radiating always presents a problem in all single-wire fed aerials such as this, as there is a tendency for these systems to work as simple ' inverted L ” aerials. A further and more fundamental difficulty occurs when it is desired to operate on two or more bands. This is that the length of the top is not the same for the harmonics as for the fundamental, but is actually about two feet longer in the 14 Me full-wave position than in the 7 Me half-wave. It is usual practice to adjust critically for 14 Me where correct low-angle radiation is always required, and to let it look after itself on 7 Me where this is not quite so important. A method of compromise is given in the next section. The correct method of adjustment involves first tuning the top, which is done by connecting the feeder at an approximate point, and inserting a pair of meters or current indicators immediately either side of the tap in the top. When these read equal currents the top is in tune. The meters are then inserted in the feeder, one at the tap and the other one-eighth wave below; when they read equally the tap is correct and the feeder non radiating. The feeder must come away at right angles and also be clear for at least a quarter-wave.A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 79 This type of aerial is very effective when correct but slight misadjustments will soon spoil it. In its harmonic varieties, particularly the longer ones, it is somewhat easier to adjust, and a radiator 136 feet long can be used very effectively on 7, 14, and 28 Me if the tap is correct on one of the higher bands, since the comparatively short feeder cannot compete with the long aerial even if it does radiate slightly. Fig. 9. Tuned Feeders for 7 Me half-wave or 14 Me full-wave. Lengths which bring the wave below the axis call for series tuning : above, parallel tuning. In proportion for other frequencies. Avoid the peaks of parallel tuning. The following table gives some suggestions for adjustments, the factors being divided by the frequency in Me to give the dimensions in feet. These will be within a few inches but the final adjustment must be made to suit the location of the aerial. The second figure for full-wave tap is the distance from the centre of one half and it will be seen that it comes nearer than in the half-wave case. For higher harmonics it comes even nearer and the top is as given under “ Long wire radiators ”. Close information is not available for other bands, but the dimensions will be nearly to scale.

Centre-fed Aerials It has already been seen how an aerial can be fed at high voltage at one end j it is also possible to feed at the centre with high current. Such an arrangement is shown in Fig. 6. The upper diagram illustrates the voltage and current distribution when the top AB is a half-wave, and the lower shows it when the top is a whole wave. Here tuned feeders are employed, and it is advisable, as in the case of Zepp. feeders, to avoid such a length as will cause the appearance of a high voltage end at the transmitter. (Fig. 10.) In the lower it will be seen that to avoid this, the feeder must not be a whole number of half-waves at the harmonic frequency of the top. If this is attended to, the feeder will be satisfactory for the fundamental. Suitable lengths will be found from Fig. 10, by avoiding those points where the curves rise to peak. This system should not be used with long feeders, but it has the advantage that the top need not be accurately tuned. Matched Impedance Aerials This type is illustrated in Fig. 11 and its operation may be explained by regarding the top as a trans former, the aerial impedance at the tapping point being that required for matching the feeder. This aerial may only be used in this way on the band for which it is designed, but where it is possible to erect an aerial for each band it will be found excellent. It is very easy to adjust, and will operate in a matched condition almost completely over one band, being very flat in its tuning properties. The dimensions for the tappings and the trailers are given in the diagram, whilst the top is a half-wave subject to the slight corrections given in the section on theory of operation. The feeder may be any length, as it is matched, and for this reason also the aerial is very efficient. The feeder may be tapped across a few turns of a free tuned circuit which is coupled to the trans mitter output. The two taps may be moved together up and down the coil, which may help to make the currents in the two wires equal. The resonant frequency of the top may be checked by listening on an ordinary receiver, provided the feeder is not too long, and does not contain an even number of half-waves (a temporary length may be added if necessary). About ten turns of wire across the home end are coupled tightly into the oscillating detector circuit of the receiver, and the effect on the reaction control is noted. The resonant fre quency is that at which the application of the feeders has most effect on the amount of reaction required for oscillation. This method is quite80 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO general and may be used on a variety of aerial systems, but it is most satisfactory in the case of matched feeders. Having tuned the top, the match ing may be done by sliding the ends of the feeders about slightly until the feeder has no effect on the tuning of the coupling circuit at the base. The length of the trailers is important, but the values given will be good enough for nearlv all cases ; in fact, all adjustments, including the tuning, will be found very flat. If the top is set in the centre of the amateur band for which it is designed, the svstem may be used with success all over that band. The remarks made earher about symmetry’ applv particularly to this aerial, and it may often be necessary’ to shift the middle by lengthening one end and shortening the other before a balance of current is obtained in the feeder wires- (TRRTj 4 T Fig. U. A Matched Impedance Aerial. Top f\ T o. 12 to 16 s.w.g.) L Trailer t Spacing s , *70 + TT - I/O 148 F 110 to 120 F 'here F is in Me and lengths in feet. The laroer values of S are for the thicker wires, or higher frequencies. In deaiing with this and any other svstem of matched feeders it is necessary’ to avoid sharp bends in the feeder, and particularlv in this svstem must a bend be avoided within about quarter-wave of the bottom of the triangle. The svstem will still work well but it will never be possible to balance lie currents in the two wires, and the losses wfll be increased slightly. If it is necessary’ to carry the lower part of the feeder parallel to the top it is advisable to give it a twist or so as it comes along. As already mentioned, this aerial is essentially a one band ' device, but there is no reason' in general why the two feeder wires may not be paralleled and the whole used as a Marconi or even an end-on arrangement on other bands. Feeder Balance The above is an example of a symmetrical aerial in which accurate matching of the feeder is not important ; a slight mismatch w’ill not cause any appreciable loss. It is very’ important, how ever, to make sure that the currents in a twin feeder are equal, and it often happens that thev will not balance. This may* occur w’hen the length from the transmitter to one end of the aerial is a half or full wave, and can be cured by’ an earthed centre tap on the coupling circuit. Coupling Circuits Various methods of coupling the aerial or the feeder to the transmitter have been discussed under the individual types. Briefly it is required to connect the aerial or feeder into a suitable tuned circuit in such a w-ay that it damps it heavily, flattening its tuning with load ; finding such an adjustment is the first step to coupling efficiency. The said tuned circuit may’ be the anode circuit of the P.A. stage, though this is not recommended for the reasons already given, or it may be a separate circuit the coil of which is magnetically coupled to the P.A. anode coil, through a link coupling. I f the transmitter has a balanced output stage or if the feeder is balanced, or both, some care may be needed to preserve the balance, such as splitting the anode coil apart in the centre and passmg the aerial coil into the gap so formed, but link coupling will be best for these cases. To adjust a link coupling first load up the trans mitter with an artificial aerial to determine its correct loading ; then choose the link turns according to the information in Chapter 4, coupling loosely at the transmitter end to start with. Next find tappmgs for the aerial which will draw some load with rather flat tuning, and then increase the coup ling at the transmitter end to load it fully It may be necessary to readjust each end again, but at the aerial end there are tw’o ways of getting the right load, viz., by coupling turns or by aerial taps. A well known coupling arrangement is shown in Fig. 12, and is known as the “Collins” or l niversal coupler. It enables almost any aerial to be coupled to any transmitter, and moreover one such device is capable of dealing with all cases m one station which uses a number of aerials and/or a number of different bands. Fig. 12. The Collins ” or Universal Coupler. (A) Balanced circuits. (B) Unbalanced.A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO In the case of two-wire feed systems Fie. 12a is the ^ arrangement The tank circuit of the output valve is adjusted for minimum feed with the network disconnectedi. The transmitter is then switched off and the leads of Q are tapped a few turns either side of the centre tap of the plate coil. (The condensers shown in these leads are for blocking off the H.T. only, and should be the largest available mica condensers say 0 01 pF.) The condenser C 2 i h&lt; L aenal end 15 set about its mid-position and with the transmitter running, Q is adjusted for minimum feed. If the input is too low or high, f ^ and readjust C, for a new minimum obtained satisfactor &gt; r operation is Suitable values are 350 to 500 ppF maximum capacity for Q and C*. The coils L, and L, may be about 30 turns 14 S.W.G. on a 2| in. former spaced over about 5 in., and tapped with a short wire to take the tapping clips ever}- few turns. The unwanted turns are shorted as shown. This is no cause of loss as it would be in a tuned circuit of a receiver or transmitter as the loads imposed on the coils by the aerial and transmitter are very heavy. Suitable turns for use are 30 for the 1 - 7 Me band, Id for 3 - 5 Me, 10 for 7 Me, and 5 for 14 Me. Adjust ments should always be made using the largest possible number of turns in circuit, but if too many are included it will not be possible to load the transmitter fully. The two coils Lj and Lj should each contain the same number of turns when using a balanced system. It may be found that the currents in the two-feeder ammeters are not equal, and if so they should not be balanced by altering the relative turns in L, and L., but rather the trouble should be sought in the aerial or earth system. For an unbalanced system, such as a Marconi aerial, the circuit is changed to that of Fig. 12b. If possible both coils should be included in the one arm, as shown. The adjustments are as before, but only one of the leads off Q is now tapped on the plate coil, the other going to the centre tap or transmitter earth line. On the 1-7 Me band when 'the aerial is more than one quarter-wave long it may be necessary to add extra capacity across C 2 , whilst if the aerial is very short Q may be loaded Tip instead. The network may be link-coupled to the transmitter output, using a fairly large value of C x with the link across it. The coils and condensers should be assembled on a panel and may be arranged for complete flexibility with clip connections throughout. It may then be used on all bands and with a number of different aerial arrangements. A chart should be attached for recording adjustments for various conditions. This device, though rather difficult to understand and handle at first, is capable of better efficiency of transformation from the transmitter to the aerial than any other which has been described, and is extremely flexible. It is also recommended for reception, especially where a half-wave aerial with twin feeders is used. Current Measurements It has been seen that the current, impedance, and voltage vary from point to point in an aerial system, and so it is necessary to be cautious in interpreting the power in the svstem in terms of CU ^ e ?u’ Some suggestions as to what to expect win therefore be helpful. An effiaent 10-watt output stage win not put more than 1/10 ampere into a matched 600-ohm feeder, as in the svstem of fig. 11, and a higher current is a definite sign of mismatch and standing waves : the current in the top would, at the same time, be about 0-3 amp hor a 100-watt transmitter the corresponding currents would be about 0-3 and 1 amp. respect tively. In a tuned feeder, such as that of the Zepp., tiie current depends on position, and mav be anything from zero to half an amp. for 10 watts input, whilst the current at the centre of each half-wave in the top is as before. Directive Properties Aerials seldom radiate uniformly in all directions, rirst, because there is never any radiation in the direction of a straight wire, and second, there is the effect of the image in the ground. Furthermore long wires favour certain directions at the expense of others, apart altogether from ground effects. Aerials are therefore said to be directive, and the directivity is defined in terms of the power radiated in a favoured direction compared with the total radiation in all possible directions in a spherical space. By making use of these properties and combinmg a number of aerials correctly some verv effective systems can be built up. } First of all, it is desirable to know what directional properties are required. At an amateur station it is generally desired to transmit equally in all directions of the compass, but at what angle to the horizontal should radiation take place to achieve best results ? It has been shown in another chapter how short-wave signals travel in a number of hops.” and it is best to reach the desired distance in a minimum number. This means that for long distances shallow radiation at a low angle is best For shorter spans, however, such as about 1 000 miles, a higher angle is desired, but then not so much power is required as at the low angle. The best compromise, therefore, is an aerial which sends most of its energy off at a low angle in all directions of the compass, with a moderate amount at some what higher angles. In advanced amateur work, applied directivitv is now often used, and this subject offers a verv interesting field of experiment, especially when coupled with a study of propagation. Vertical Directivity For convenience, directivitv is divided into that taking place in the vertical plane and that taking place in the horizontal plane. To secure a good signal in the right direction of the compass horizontal directivity is of first importance, whilst to cover the correct distances the angle of elevation of the wave or vertical directivity must be correct. Diagrams representing the relative strengths of signal in various directions are known as “ polar diagrams ” and each type has its own vertical and horizontal diagrams. The vertical aerial has uniform radiation in the horizontal plane, but its vertical diagram is affected to a very great extent by the ground, as is that of any system. Considering Fig. 3, we have alreadv seen how the “image” appears. Now, in the horizontal condition we are looking at the aerialA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADK3 from the best viewpoint and maximum strength is received, but in some direction such as AX the image appears further away. If X is Y er y rem °^’ the image wave will be along the parallel line A &gt; and will have the extra distance AZ to traverse. This will put it out of phase with the direct ray from A and so it will not add so effectively as m the horizontal direction. As the angle of elevation increases, the signal gets less and less until in e vertical direction it becomes zero. The polar diagram is as in Fig. 13a, whilst the horizon a diagram is of course a circle. ' , /////}////7777/T///7/77s'-7 Fig. 13. vertical directivity is very complicated, and depends- on the height. We shall therefore only consider the simplest cases. The half-wave wire sends no energy in the direction of the wire, and has a broad maximum in all directions at right angles to it. When considering the effect of the ground a honzontal aerial will send off most in a direction at right angles to the wire and at an angle to the earth which is steep for low wires, and becomes shallower as the wire is raised. The best height is a wave length but this is not often possible except sometimes in the case of 14 Me (which requires 60 ft ) Half a wavelength is fairly good, however, and often attained on 7 Me. In the direction of the wire, a horizontal aerial is not usually successful, but an excellent compromise can be effected by sloping the wire at about 30 degrees to the horizontal, when good radiation can be obtained off the low end as well as sideways, having the effect of filling up one end of the top diagram of Fig. 14. Vertical Polar Diagrams. (A) Quarter-wave earthed (Left.) t B) Half-wave, free, at ground level. (Right.) Now suppose the ware is half a wave long. Then together with its image it becomes a full wave aerial, the image now being in opposite phase. The result is that horizontally the two waves will cancel, giving zero, whilst at some angle, such as 30 degrees, the image signal will travel half a wave further than the direct signal and the phase thus become additive. \ ertically, again there is, of course, zero, and the diagram is as shown in Fig. 13b. Raising the half-wave above the ground increases the number of directions in which addition takes place; for example, if the bottom is one quarter- wave high then horizontal signals again appear together with another “ lobe ” at a high angle. Of these the first is very effective for long distance work in all directions provided it is in clear space, though it has been found that amongst trees or buildings it is not so effective. It is also much more liable to cause interference in local receivers than a horizontal aerial. The others are not very useful because most of the energy goes off at the high angle. Horizontal Directivity The polar diagrams for various lengths of wire in free space are given in Fig. 14, the number of half-waves being indicated ; the wires are marked thick. These occur in much the same way as for the vertical case. Starting with a number of current loops in the wire in alternate phases, there are certain directions in which the distances involved allow all the component signals to add, and others in which they cancel. There is of course always zero along the direction of the wire. It will also be seen that when there is an even number of half-waves the components cancel at right angles to the wire. The largest lobe is always nearest the wire, and as the length becomes greater (i.e., more half-waves) the number of minor lobes increases. In the absence of the ground these lobes are really cones about the wire as axis, and their number is equal to the number of half-waves on the wire. With the wire parallel to the ground these polar diagrams are still effective horizontally but the Polar diagrams in the plane of the wire for half, full (2) and two-wave (4) Aerials. The angles of the lobes are 54° In (2) and 36° and 75° in (4).A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 83 A full-wave aerial in practice shows very clearly the effect to be expected from Fig. 14 \ radiation in the favoured directions being good, together with short distance high angle radiation off the ends. If the height is f-wave the end radiation begins to become effective. The sloping method can again be used to help one way. The two-wave (4 half-wave) aerial is very effective. It is so inherently directive that the ground has much less disturbing effect than in the shorter cases, and where space is available this makes a verv good long or short distance aerial, practically omni directional. The end radiation is now fairly low, and the only blank direction (at right angles or broadside ”) is critically defined within a few degrees. Such an aerial is possible for 14 Me when the length is about 136 feet, whilst on 7 Me it would become a full-wave. Aerials with more half-waves are even more powerful but are not usually attainable. Effect of Feeders Generally speaking, the properties of an aerial are not affected by the method of feeding, provided the feeder does not radiate. The single wire fed is most likely to go wrong; the Zepp. is an exception in which the two feed wires are not balanced. The twin balanced feeder is the safest, for provided the energy is fed into them it must be radiated by the aerial ; having nowhere else to go ! The full-wave case of the centre-fed aerial of Fig. 5 (lower), however, does not follow these rules, for here it will be noticed that the two halves of the top are in step with each other, or in phase, and, therefore, aid in directions at right angles to the wire. The characteristics of this aerial are much the same as those of a single half-wave, except that the radiation tends to be more directive at right angles to the wire, and this is what happens whenever the aerial has a whole number of half-waves each side of the feed point. The diagram is then more like that of one half of the system. The Great Circle Map In Fig. 15 is shown a rather uncommon projection of the Earth’s surface. It is constructed with London at the centre in such a way that all places on the globe are in their true direction from the centre and their distance is also to scale. Finding the direction and distance cannot be achieved with an ordinary atlas because such maps attempt to show the world to scale. In Fig. 15 (which is called a “ Great Circle ” or ' Azimuthal ” projec tion), distances, except along the radii are badly distorted ; the edge of the circle is really the antipodean point to London, and New Zealand which is roughly the same size as Great Britain tends to spread round the edge. The map cannot be applied to other measurements than those from the centre, but such a map can be drawn with any place as centre. Our illustration which is to the scale of 10,000 miles to the inch is too small for accurate work, but an excellent map ten times as large can be obtained from Messrs. Iliffe 6- Sons, price 2s. This map has been introduce! because of its great value in setting up aerial systems. Wireless waves, in general, travel round the earth along great circles, and so by tracing out the diagrams of Fig. 14 and applying them to the map we can find out what a given aerial will do and see which is the best direction to set up the wire. In tracing the polar diagrams, the ends should be carried across so as to allow for a certain amount of “ end ” radiation, as indicated in the previous section. Fig. 15. A Great-circle Map centred on London. All directions and distances from the centre are true to scale. The zones marked are the pales,—N. and S., U.S.A.—W, Brazil—PY, S. Africa—ZS, India—VCJ, Japan—J, Australia—VK and New Zealand—ZL. Applied Directivity—Beam Aerials Directive systems can be built up in two ways, firstly by combining a number of half wave radiators, and secondly by taking advantage of the known directive properties of long wires and building up combinations of these. In either case the com ponent parts are fed in such a way that the signals add in the favoured direction and tend to cancel in other directions. The signal strength in the favoured direction and the sharpness of the “ beam ” increase with the size and complexity of the “ array ” ; and in commercial point-to-point work, by the use of an array occupying up to thirty or more “ square wavelengths ” of area, a beam only a few degrees wide is obtained. In amateur work only the smaller structures with their limited directivity can be used, but some of these can give very helpful results, especially if they are applied to obtaining low angle radiation rather than great horizontal directivity. Reflectors The first step is to turn all the radiation over to one side of the aerial so that the power on this side is doubled and on the other side reduced towards zero. Fig. 16 shows a pair of half-wave elements both supplied from a common feeder at the right. Energy arriving at the first joint separates, half being radiated from the right hand wire and the rest travelling down the connecting feeder to be radiated from the left hand wire. Now suppose that the spacing D is made one quarter-wave.A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO direction, it is usually pointed to steer the minimum signal where desired rather than to face it accurately towards the wanted direction A simple switch can be arranged for reversing the link and if the aerial is mounted vertically it can easily be ma.de rotatable. An important point is that the chara £- teristic impedance of the connecting link must be about 80 ohms to match the aerials, otherwise the standing wave developed on it will oppose the flow of energy from one wire to the other. Alternatively some matching device must_be used. 1 he length of the elements L is about as for a single half wave, and the spacing D is feet, where F is the frequency in Me. Owing to the size they would otherwise attain, such arrays are only convenient w 14 Mr and higher freouencies. Then towards the right hand direction the radiations from the two elements will cancel, since that from the left wire has to make a double quarter-wave extra journey, and so arrives half a wave or half a cycle late, making it oppose the radiation from the right hand wire. In the other direction, towards the left, there is no difference in journey between the two radiated components, consequently all the energy is radiated this way. In this case the right hand element is called a reflector, and because both elements are supplied directly from the feeder, it is said to be a “ driven reflector.” If the connecting link is crossed so that the D L COUPLING REVERSED. Fig. 16. Radiator and Reflector. Polar diagrams are shown for two spacings, and with both polarities of the reflector wire. current in the right hand element is reversed, then it will be seen that the radiations towards the left will cancel, whilst towards the right there is in addition to the half-cycle ” space delay ” another half-cycle delay due to the reversal, bringing the radiations in this direction one whole cycle different, i.e., back into step and additive. Reversing the link thus reverses the direction of radiation, and the two polar diagrams of the system are shown immediately below it. In this way can be built a simple reversible beam aerial, which will give a great improvement over a single wire at great distances, not because of the extra power in the favoured direction, but chiefly on account of the lowering of the angle of radiation towards the horizon. The radiators may be either horizontal or vertical with equal effectiveness. In reception, it is of great help to be able to shut out interfering signals from the ' back,” and in fact, due to the broadness in the forward Parasitic Radiators It is not essential that both wires be driven directly ; one of them may quite well be free to pick up and re-radiate some of the energy from the driven element. The free wire is called a '' para sitic ” radiator, and can either reflect the wave away from it or draw it over towards it, according to its length. In these cases the minimum is not so good as when both wires are driven, but the polar diagram is very similar in other respects. With a spacing D and driven element L as before, the free wire is feet long for reflection and — r r feet long if it is to be a “ director.’ In the practical arrangement the direction can easily be reversed by connecting a clip across an insulator placed at the point of the free wire so as to lengthen it by the correct amount, which is approximately 4 feet on 14 Me. A Four-way Array If in Fig. 16 the distance D is made half a 492 feet wavelength, p , then the polar diagrams available are as shown, at the bottom. The parallel connection shown places the two wires in opposite phase, and allowing for the time of transit, it will be seen that their radiations add in both directions. By crossing the connections of the link the wires are placed in phase and their radiations cancel in the plane of the array but add in the “ broadside ” direction. The change-over can again be arranged easily and in this case the link may be of any reasonable characteristic impedance. This fyp e can only be used with vertical radiators, but it is also very effective in lowering the angle of radiation. Broadside Arrays By using these two principles, viz., placing radiators in a row and all in phase with each other, and setting up a chain of reflectors behind them, a highly directive ' broadside array ” can be built up, and this is the basis of commercial types. The elements can be vertical or horizontal and can be “ stacked ” one above the other as well as in horizontal rows, the stacking giving low angle radiation. The elements can in theory be separated by any amount, but a half-wave separation is most effective. Arrays of this type appear under a variety of names but differ chiefly in the method of feeding their elements. A large array of this typeA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 85 will employ up to twenty-four columns three or four elements high ; and owing to the complication of structure which this involves, these types are now being abandoned in favour of simpler but equally effective long wire structures. Long Wire Beams—The “ Vee ” The four half-wave radiator of Fig. 14 has its major lobes of radiation at angles of 36 degrees to the wire. If we were to take two such radiators in the form of a V with an included angle of twice 36 or 72 degrees, then provided they were fed correctly two pairs of major lobes would add along the bisector of the V, whilst the remainder would be in odd directions and would not necessarily add. Such an arrangement is shown in Fig. 17a, and is known as the RCA Vee aerial. As shown, it will operate in both directions along the bisector, but if a reflector of similar type is placed behind it then it becomes unidirectional. It is equally useful in transmission or reception, and of course becomes more directive and more effective as its length (in wavelengths) increases. The angle A depends on the length L in wavelengths, as follows :— L wavelengths Angle A 1 110° 2 70° 3 60° 4 57° 8 35° The adjustments are in no way critical ; in fact the aerial tunes quite flatly over a wide frequency range, and can be used effectively on two or three amateur bands provided it is long enough. It is of course most efficient on the band for which it is designed. As it is symmetrical it may conveniently be fed by a balanced line, and if it is desired to match the line impedance to the aerial, the method shown is convenient though not essential. Quarter-wave “ Stubs ” The transformer shown in Fig. 17a is called a ' matching stub,” and operates as follows. The length S is first adjusted by sliding the shorting bar till the system is in resonance as given by maximum current in the shorting bar. The “ stub,” being made of two close parallel wires, does not radiate, but there is a standing wave along it, and so the impedance across it varies from point to point. There is thus a point at which a transmission line can be correctly matched in, and this can be found by sliding the taps about till there are no standing waves on the feeder. This type of transformer is available for use wherever a symmetrical system is to be fed. For example, it can be used with a straight centre-fed aerial, or for the simple two-wire arrays illustrated, but it tends to limit the operation to one band. It has even been applied to the Zeppelin aerial, but in this case it is very difficult to obtain a balance on the feeder. The “ Bruce ” This aerial, Fig. 17b, also known as the ” Inverted Vee ” is another long wire aerial working on a slightly different principle. It will not be described, in great detail here, but briefly it is a single long wire in the form of an inverted V, fed between one end and earth. When it is so dimensioned that the length L is one half-wave greater than D, signals in the horizontal direction and in the plane of the V add up. A new feature is the termina tion of the far end of the wire to make it aperiodic, the value of the resistance R being of the order of 400 ohms. When this is done correctly it operates only in the direction of the arrow. It is most useful in reception, but unlike the horizontal Vee type, it needs a high mast. The Diamond Aerial This highly successful development of the Vee (Fig. 17c) has been called the “Rolls-Royce” amongst aerials. Briefly it consists of two hori zontal V’s placed end to end, but it can be designed according to a variety of methods to secure the (A) The “Vee.” (B) The “Bruce” or “Inverted Vee.” (C) The “Diamond.” Radiation is in the direction indicated, and reception from the same direction.correct combination of directivity and angle of wave elevation. As with the Bruce type, it can be terminated to make it aperiodic over a very %vi e range of wavelengths, and the resistance K U n this case around 800 ohms) absorbs all the energy which would be transmitted to or received from the “ rear.” In transmission the resistance absorbs half the power and must therefore be some kind of resistance mat of sufficient dissipation. In recep tion, if correctly terminated, this aerial can be a most powerful factor, favouring the correct direction to the almost complete exclusion of interference from all others. Choice of Aerial System With all this information it will probably be a difficult task to decide what is best, and matters are often complicated by the fact that local circum stances limit severelv the available directions and height, so that a short summary will probably help. It will be generally assumed that it is desired to work on several amateur bands with one aerial, including the 7 and 14 Me bands. The primary ■object, of course, is to get the aerial as high and clear as possible. If the transmitter is to be located at the top of a building, then one of the -end-on arrangements may be used, and converted to a Marconi with earth or counterpoise for the lower frequencies, but it is not advised if the station is at ground level. Multi-band operation usually makes the feeder system difficult, limiting one to the Zeppelin or a centre-fed type, or possibly a single wire feed operating correctly on one band only. In all these •cases it will pay to try to keep the feeder length down. The best length of top is the greatest possible, say 136 feet, or if this is impracticable, 66 feet. all directions with one aerial is usually only possible for'those* who are licensed to use higher power. It often turns out, however, that an aerial does not behave according to theory, and then it is found that some factor, such as a tree, for example has been overlooked, and the design has to be modified, accordingly. Receiving Aerials The receiving problem is not quite the same as thjtransmitting one ; m the latter case « JS a'ways desired to give the loudest signal at the other end, but when receiving, what is required is the greatest ratio of signal to noise, and the noise may originate in the receiver, or it may be interference from near or moderately distant electrical equipment. Also it may be atmospheric noise coming in by the same routes as the signal. To overcome the first it is obviously best to use a big aerial that can produce a loud signal, and for this there is nothing better than the transmitting aerial, connected as it would be to the transmitter. For dealing with the second form of interference, the best aerial will depend on local conditions, and a large aerial m ^y be best in one case whereas a very short one would be best in another. The third case cannot be dealt with to any extent at the receiving station except in certain cases by the use of directional receiving aerials. A system thoroughly to be recommended is a centre-fed top with either twisted flex or transposed twin wires. Together with a Collins Coupler as described this will make an excellent arrangement, both from the point of view of signals and local interference. By means of the coupler it will be possible to tune it correctly for all bands. The length of top is not critical, but results will be roughly according to the information given for 4-i 4 -t-* nr d Q 1 Q It will pay to study the map of Fig. 15 in conjunc tion with the polar diagrams, and where it is possible to do so, a slope down towards the south will be very useful as this will tend to make the aerial cover most of the inhabited part of the globe. A 136-foot radiator will, however, be found practically omnidirectional on 14 and 28 Me. In cramped locations, the best that can be done is to get all the radiator as high as possible, even if it means folding it to get the length. Folding will upset the dimensions already given, but if the energy reaches the top it must radiate. Testing of Aerials When an aerial has been erected and adjusted to satisfaction, it often happens that it does not give immediate results, but it should never be condemned on this score. Short-wave transmission has a habit of “ going bad ” for periods now and then ; in fact, it is this variability of transmission conditions which is one of the most fascinating attractions of short-wave work. It is, therefore, necessary to give any aerial a trial lasting several weeks before one can be sure if it is working properly or not. With a 10-watt transmitter and a good aerial it is possible occasionally to send a good readable signal over long distances in at least one direction, but to give a good average signal in It is emphasised that as a general rule the use of the transmitting aerial for reception, connected as it would be to the transmitter, is excellent. It is a splendid way of finding out the transmitting properties of the aerial, and it also tends to prevent one from wasting time calling stations one can receive well, but to whom one is not sending a good signal, since the two operations of sending and receiving on an aerial are governed by the same laws. Conclusion By a study of the foregoing it should be possible for the beginner to derive benefit from the vast amount of experimental work which has been done in the past, and know how to set about building his transmitting aerial so as to secure the best results that his local conditions will permit. AERIAL PROBLEMS. Aerial problems are dealt with extensively in the T. &amp; R. Bulletin, whilst constructional articles covering the design and erection of suitable masts and radiators are also featured. Advice concerning aerials is given by the R.S.G.B. Technical Enquiry Bureau, details of which appear in a later chapter.I CHAPTER EIGHT Receivers Straight Superheterodyne—Super-regenerative Types—A.\ .C.— Crystal Filters—Noise Suppression I T is intended in this chapter to explain the operation of various types of receivers and to discuss in a general way particular methods used in the design and the manner in which these methods differ from those employed in broadcast receivers. The objects of a receiver are to enable a signal on a particular wavelength to be tuned in and made audible and to enable the signal to be separated from other signals having wavelengths of the same order. The former implies that the receiver must tune to the required wavelength and must possess sufficient range or “ sensitivity ” to enable a weak signal to be heard, and the latter implies that the tuning should be sufficiently sharp or discriminating to separate the wanted signal from the unwanted, i.e., the ' selec tivity ” should be high. How sensitivity and selectivity are obtained will be covered later in this chapter. There are three main types of receiver each having numerous variations of arrangement; these are :— (1) Straight Receiver often known as a T.R.F. (tuned radio frequency). (2) Superheterodyne. (3) Super-regenerative. It is proposed to describe the essential theory of the above three types before going on to practical details. (I) Straight Receiver (T.R.F.) This form of receiver is generally, of the three types mentioned, the simplest and cheapest to- construct. It comprises a possible radio-frequency amplifier, some form of detector, and a low-frequency or audio-frequency amplifier. *H Fig. 1 shows a circuit of such a receiver. The first valve V! is a radio-frequency (R.F.) amplifier. The aerial is coupled to the grid coil 1^ through a small coupling coil and the grid coil is tuned with a variable condenser C, to the required frequency or wavelength. The incoming signal is amplified in the valve, and the amplified output appears across the second tuned circuit L 2 C 2 . The R.F. voltage across- this circuit L 2 C 2 is applied to the detector valve V 2 . Before proceeding further it would be as well to describe the action of the detector and the types that may be used. The simplest type of valve detector is a diode, which comprises a filament or cathode and anode, and has the property of passing current in one direction only, i.e. rectification. (For a description of the fundamental principles of the valve see Chapter 3.) Now, if we apply a modulated R.F. carrier wave such as Fig. 2A to a diode valve connected in a circuit such as Fig. 2B, where the carrier frequency is Fj and the modulation frequency F 2 , the diode88 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO rectifies the modulated carrier only ; the top part of the sketch Fig. 2 A above the line xx will appear in the output across R x in Fig. 2B ; and this output will appear as a direct current, which varies up and down at a rate depending on the frequency of F x and F 2 . Now if we connect across a condenser Cj, of such a value that its reactance to the carrier frequency F x is very low, but its reactance to F 2 is high, then the variation of voltage due to Fj will charge it up to some mean value that is constant as far as F x is concerned, but its voltage will vary up and down about this mean value at a frequency F 2 . Flence an A.C. voltage appears across Q R x that varies according to F 2 , which is the audio modula tion frequency, and if this voltage is applied to the grid of an amplifying valve an audio output will be obtained in the anode circuit. A diode detector is not in general suitable for use on short waves and its use is confined to superheterodyne receivers ; nevertheless, the principles of operation outlined above are common to all types of detector. For short wave use there are two basic methods of detection :—(a) Anode Bend ; (6) Leaky Grid. (a) The Anode Bend Detector This detector depends for its action on the fact that the anode current—grid voltage characteristic of a valve is curved both at the bottom and top. The top bend is rarely used in practice, so we will confine ourselves to the bottom bend. Fig. 3 shows the dynamic characteristic of an H.L. type Figs. 2a and 2b. Diode Detector. battery valve. An unmodulated voltage of 1 5 volts R.M.S. is applied to the grid, which has a grid bias of 2 • 7 volts ; this is shown at the bottom of Fig. 3, and on the right of the curve is shown the resultant anode current variation obtained by geometric projection. It can be seen that recti fication is not perfect as with a diode because there is some reverse current (the shaded area). The efficiency as a rectifier is one area divided by the other. Fig. 4 shows the effect of applying a modulated carrier, projected in the same way. It will be noticed that the anode current shows, as in Fig. 3, the rectified peaks of carrier, but in this case the peaks vary in height according to the modulation. In both cases the mean anode current rises above the initial value. If we connect in the anode circuit a circuit arranged to separate the modulated and modulating frequencies, we can select the one we require. Fig. 5 shows such a circuit. RFC is an R.F. choke which presents a high impedance to R.F. but a negligible one to A.F. The condenser C passes the R.F. away to earth, but will not pass A.F. as with a diode detector. The audio output appears across the load R, which may be a resistance or the primary of an A.F. transformer. It will be seen that in Fig. 4 as long as the valve operates over the straight portion of its curve, ABC, the resultant A.F. voltage will be linear and an exact reproduction of the original modulation, but if the portion ABC is curved the A.F. output will be distorted. The grid bias corres ponding to the point C is chosen so that it is just on the bend of the curve as shown. Also the R.F. input to the grid must not be allowed to exceed a value where the point A swings up the curve further than the zero line, i.e., the grid should not be allowed to run positive or distortion will result. (b) Leaky Grid Rectification The leaky grid detector depends for its action on the fact that when the grid of a valve is made positive a current flows from the grid to the filament or cathode, known as grid current. Now referring back to the circuit Fig. 1, the valve V 2 has a high resistance R x and a condenser C s between the grid and the tuned circuit L 2 C 2 . If an unmodulated carrier is set up in L 2 C 2 corresponding to the carrier of a station, then at a time when the voltage is zero, i.e., the sine wave of R.F. passes through zero, there will be no voltage across L 2 C 2 and both plates of the condenser C 3 will be at zero potential. If we imagine the resistance R x discon nected and the carrier increased to, say, 2 volts negative, the anode current will be some steady value and no grid current will flow. The grid itself will be 2 volts negative with respect to the filament, and as the condenser C # is as yet uncharged its plates will be at equal potential. Next imagine that we travel rapidly through zero to a position of 2 volts positive (at 20 metres wave length this would take 1/30 of a millionth of a second) ; now the left-hand plate C 8 is 2 volts positive, and since the condenser is still uncharged the grid will also become 2 volts positive and the anode current will suddenly rise. But as the grid has become positive, grid current will start to flow and the right-hand plate of C 3 will begin to lose its positive potential, whilst the left-hand plate remains at -f- 2 volts ; in other words the condenser is acquiring a charge. After an interval of time, depending on the value of C 3 , the grid will lose its■■■■■■■ warn A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 89 positive potential entirely, and let us assume it returns to its original value of — 2 volts, at which value grid current ceases to flow and no further change takes place. Now if we move rapidly back to the original condition or on to the next half cycle, the left-hand plate of C 8 is then — 2 volts and simultaneously the right-hand plate will become 2 volts more negative or — 4 volts, and as there is no grid current at — 4 volts the grid will remain at this potential indefinitely if no further change takes place and if the insulation is perfect. Hence the object of the high resistance R, or grid leak. With the leak connected, the charge will leak away and the grid will take up a potential such that the current from grid to filament equals the current through the grid leak in either positive or negative half cycle. Now with an R.F. voltage applied, the left-hand plate of C s will vary from + 2 volts to — 2 volts as before, but the grid will not vary in quite the same way as before. On the positive half cycle the condenser will become fully charged as before, but on the negative half cycle the time will be sufficient for the condenser to discharge completely through R x , with the result that the condenser will remain slightly negatively charged as long as the R.F. input is applied, causing the anode current to drop to a mean value. lie on a straight line. It will be seen from the diagram that rectification is present and that the effect is the same as for anode bend rectification but upside down. The values of C a and R! are chosen so that their time constant is long compared with one cycle of the carrier but short compared with one cycle of audio frequency. The time constant in p, secs, is taken as the product of C 3 and Ri where C is in p.p.F and R in megohms. A usual value of C 3 for short waves is •oooi p.F and R x from 1 to 5 megohms. In the so-called “ power grid ” detector the mode of operation is the same except that we use con siderably higher anode voltage on V 2 , and due to the different grid current characteristic under these conditions we are enabled to use more suitable values for C 3 and Rj and thereby obtain a condition more nearly approaching Fig. 6B, i.e., less distortion. Fig. 4. Anode Bend Rectification (modulated signal). Comparing the two types of detector'there is little to choose between them as regards distortion, if operated correctly, but the leaky grid method is more sensitive to weak signals than the anode bend, due to the fact that it is operating higher up on the valve characteristic, i.e., where the mutual conductance or slope of the valve is higher. The sensitivity to strong signals is much the same for good signal to noise or background ratio is required for C.W. morse, the anode bend type, whilst giving the same loudness of signal, will reduce the noise. The leaky grid type, due to the grid current shunting the coil witn a resistance; tms win tenu to lower the selectivity of the circuit. Selectivity and Reaction At this stage it would be as well to explain the terms “ selectivity ” and “ reaction.” When a coil is tuned with a condenser to reson ance with the applied R.F. voltage, a current flows90 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO around the circuit. This current depends on the applied voltage and the R.F. resistance of the coil and condenser. Obviously the lower this resistance the greater the current at the resonance frequency, and at the same time the smaller, compared with the resonant current, will be the current at any frequency other than the resonant one ; the ratio of the current at the resonance frequency to the current at some other frequency is known as the “ selectivity ' of the circuit. In practice the resistance of the coil and condenser determines the selectivity, and thence the current in the coil and the voltage across it; obviously the most selective circuit will provide the most voltage to apply to the grid of a valve and at the same time reduce the input of any undesirable frequency, i.e., interference, in proportion. We can reduce this resistance to a fairly low value by good coil and condenser design, but a practical limit is reached and we have to resort to another method. Fig. 5. Anode Bend Detector. If the grid of a valve is connected to a tuned •circuit to amplify the voltage across this circuit, and some of the amplified voltage in the anode circuit is returned to the grid in such a direction as to increase the voltage already on the grid, the grid total voltage is increased in effect, which is the same thing as lowering the resistance of the tuned circuit. If the amount of amplified voltage feedback is increased until the amount of feedback is such that all the losses in the tuned circuit are can celled out, then the voltage and the selectivity will be infinitely great ; actually in practice oscillation of the valve takes place just before this ideal condition is reached. Nevertheless, a considerable reduction of the R.F. resistance and an increase in the voltage is effected before oscillation occurs. The actual increase of voltage is usually of the order of 20 times. The effect of reaction, as this process is called, is to introduce negative resistance into the tuned circuit. In practice the reaction is applied as a rule to detector valves and to the I.b. amplifier of superheterodyne receivers. In Fig. 1 the reaction on the detector valve V, is applied through a variable condenser C 4 and the separate coil (reaction coil) L 3 coupled to L,. In some types of detector circuit the condenser' C. is fixed, and the amount of feedback is controlled by altering the amplification of the valve V 2 by varying the anode voltage, or, when a pentode valve is used, by varying the screen voltage. For the reception of C.W. signals the detector valve is allowed just to oscillate by increasing reaction, and the tuning altered to give an audio beat or note with the incoming carrier. Under these conditions the detector is operating in its most sensitive and selective state, which accounts for the generally better reception of C.W. signals on T.R.F. receivers. Audio Frequency Amplification The output of any of the above types of detector is usually amplified by an audio frequency amplifier in order to increase the strength of signals, particu larly where a loud-speaker is employed. In such an amplifier the coupling between the valves may be a resistance capacity network or, as in Fig. 1, an A.F. transformer. Where a volume control is required it is usual to use a potientiometer across the secondary of the transformer or as a grid leak for the amplifier valve V 2 in the case of resistance capacity coupling, arranged in either case so that the grid of the valve is connected to the slider of the potentiometer. The valves for the A.F. amplifier are given a grid bias such that they operate over the straight portion of their charac teristic curve. This grid bias may be obtained from Fig. 6. Leaky Grid Rectification.A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 91 a battery or by a system known as autobias, which consists of placing a resistance between the cathode and earth. The bias is obtained by virtue of the voltage drop across the resistance caused by the anode current passing through it. This results in the cathode becoming positive with respect to the earth, and as the grid is connected in effect to earth, the grid is negative with respect to the cathode. The resistance should be shunted with a condenser to prevent audio voltages being developed across it: a suitable value is 25 pF. Grid bias for R.F. ampli fiers can also be obtained in the same way ; if a variable p valve is used the grid bias may be varied by making the resistance variable and so varying the amplification. For R.F. the value of the shunting condenser should be about oT pF.

(2) Superheterodyne Receiver The superheterodyne receiver differs from the T.R.F. in that the signal or carrier frequency is amplified at the original signal frequency, the frequency is then changed to another frequency and further amplified before being rectified in the detector and applied to the audio amplifier. The second frequenev is known as the ‘ intermediate frequency ” (I.F') and the amplifier working at this frequency as the I.F. amplifier. The reason for this is that by changing the frequency we can choose an I.F. frequency such that the amplification and selectivity are just what we may require, also as this frequency is fixed by the design, once the initial adjustments have been made no further tuning of this amplifier is required. The process of frequency changing depends on the same principles as modulation in a transmitter. A valve is operated on a non-linear part of its characteristic curve. The signal carrier is applied to the valve and at the same time a separate oscillator or adjustable second carrier is applied, with the result that in the anode or output circuit both carriers appear, also the sum of the two carrier frequencies and the difference of the two frequencies. For example, if we have a. signal carrier of 1,000 kc and we adjust the local oscillator to 1,500 kc, then in the output of the frequency changer there are present 1,000 kc, 1,500 kc, 2,500 kc, and 500 kc. If the output circuit is tuned to, say, 500 kc and the I.F. amplifier is also tuned to 500 kc, the 500 kc beat will be amplified, and if the original 1,000 kc signal was- modulated, then the 500 kc beat will also be modu lated, and if the output of the I.F. amplifier is- detected the modulation will be audible in the detector output. If the I.F amplifier has sufficient selectivity all other frequencies present in the frequency changer output except the I.F. will be rejected. Obviously, the I.F. may be higher or lower than the signal frequency, depending on whether the sum or difference frequency is used. For example, commercial “ All Wave ” receivers usually use an I.F. of 465 kc, in which case on long waves the signal frequency is lower than the I.F. and on other wavebands the signal frequency is higher than the I.F. The type of valve used for a frequency changer varies in different types of receivers ; it may be a pentode and a separate triode or pentode local oscillator or a combined valve where the mixing valve and local oscillator are mounted in one valve. (For details see Chapter 3.) The local oscillator frequency is adjusted as part of the process of tuning the receiver so that for all wavelengths the sum or difference in fre quency, as the case may be, between it and the signal carrier is equal to the I.F. The condenser adjusting the oscillator frequency is usually ganged to those tuning the R.F. amplifier or aerial circuit, but it is necessary to arrange that the change in oscillator frequency occurs with tuning at a different rate from the R.F. circuits in order that the sum or difference (I.F.) remains constant. This result is accomplished either by using specially shaped vanes for the oscillator section of the gang condenser or by a method of placing a condenser, known as a “ padding condenser,” in series with the oscillator tuning condenser. In a multi-wave superheterodyne there are separate R.F. and oscillator coils for each wave band, together with trimming and padding con densers arranged to be brought into circuit with ganged switches. Coils not in use are often short- circuited in order to avoid absorption effect from other coils in use and all coils may then be mounted adjacently. The efficiency of the frequency changer depends to a great extent on the correct voltage of the local oscillator and on the ratio of signal frequency to I.F. For these reasons the oscillator coil design and circuit have to be carefully designed and the I.F. frequency must be chosen so that the ratio is not too great. Short wave superheterodynes have an I.F. around 450/500 kc. in order that when the receiver is tuned to say 20 Me the ratio is- not exceedingly large. Superheterodynes especially designed for frequencies between 30 and 60 Me usually have an I.F. around 4 Me. Another reason for keeping the ratio low is that the- apparent sharpness of tuning resulting from a high ratio makes tuning difficult. Cl, C2 C3 C4 C5 LI L2-L3 L4, L5 R.F.C. T1 Rl, R5 R2 R3 R4 VI V2, V392 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO In order to receive C.W. signals a second oscillator is coupled to the detector input after the I.F. amplifier, and adjusted to such a frequency that it beats with the I.F. to give an audible frequency. It is necessary that care should be taken in the design so that no output of this I.F. beat oscillator gets back to the input of the I.F. amplifier or overloading may result, but in any case the voltage of this oscillator and the voltage of the average I.F. signal should be of the same order for the best results. As the selectivity of a superheterodyne depends on both the R.F. and I.F. circuits, it is usual for the bulk of the selectivity to be in the I.F. amplifier Layout of typical 1-v-l T.R.F. Receiver. See Fig. 1 for circuit. as this is of fixed frequency and therefore remains constant once it has been adjusted. The “I.F. Selectivity” is obtained by using efficient coils or I.F. transformers of high Q, usually wound with stranded wire (Litz) and fitted in some cases with air dielectric trimmers instead of mica. For telephony reception the coils are arranged for a band-pass, that is to say, the two coils forming the I.F. transformer are tuned to slightly different frequencies in order to transform the sharp peak of the resonance curve into a narrow flat-topped peak. Where extreme selectivity is required reaction may be applied to the I.F. amplifier in the same way as for a T.R.F. detector. Another method is to employ a quartz crystal in the I.F. amplifier. This crystal has a frequency equal to the I F. and will act as a very selective tuned circuit and is known as a “ crystal filter” or more popularly as a “ crystal gate.” The “ R.F. selectivity ” must be of a reasonably high order otherwise two objectionable types of interference may be present. The first is known as “ Second Channel ” interference and is caused by the fact that there are always two R.F. frequencies that can beat with the local oscillator and give the required I.F. As an example, if the I.F. of a receiver is 500 kc and the signal being received is 14,000 kc, then the local oscillator will be tuned to 14,500 kc’, but if there is an interfering signal on 15,000* kc that will also beat and give 500 kc I.F., so that it is necessary in this case that the R.F. tuned circuits should be able to reject the 15,000 kc signal adequately. The second type of interference is less common, but can take place with strong ^ local signals when an interfering signal gets through the R.F. circuits and beats with the harmonic of the local oscillator. In the above example a signal on 28,500 or 29,500 kc could beat with twice the local oscillator frequency 29,000 kc and give 500 kc. ^ Another possible case of interference occurs when a signal at I.F. arriving on the aerial gets through the R.F. tuned circuits: this rarely occurs when there is more than one R.F. tuning circuit and it can be cured by fitting a rejector circuit in the aerial circuit tuned to the I.F. Due to the generally higher sensitivity of super heterodyne receivers over T.R.F. receivers, stations suffering from fading are more often receivable and a method of overcoming this fading known as ' Automatic Volume Control ” (A.V.C.) is employed. Where this method is used the detector valve after the I.F. amplifier is a diode valve. The rectified I.F. carrier, which appears as a D.C. current in the diode load, depends for its amplitude on the strength of the I.F. carrier and of course originally on the signal from the aerial. This D.C. is applied as grid bias to the I.F. amplifier valves and sometimes to the R.F. amplifier and frequency changer as well, in such a way that increase in signal strength increases the grid bias and hence lowers the amplification. In this way the output remains nearly constant whatever the aerial input. In some cases a small fixed voltage is arranged to be in opposition to the A.V.C. voltage so that no drop in amplification occurs until this voltage is overcome; this is done in order that no A.V.C. action occurs on weak signals and is known as Delayed A.\ .C.” In other cases where exception ally perfect A.V.C. is required, the A.V.C. voltage is amplified before application as grid bias in a valve and is then known as ' Amplified A.V.C.” . Where delayed A.V.C. is used a double-diode valve is used, one diode being used for audio and one for A.V.C. as it is undesirable to put a delay voltage in the audio circuit. Where no A.V.C. is required any type of detector may be used, such as Leaky Grid or Anode Bend. In the case of an ultra short-wave superheterodvne with a 4 Me I.F. a diode detector is not very satis factory due to its internal capacity bypassing the I.F., therefore either leaky grid or anode bend is employed. A recent application of a form of A.\ C. is a noise suppression circuit where the circuit is so arranged that any noise peaks having an ampli tude appreciably greater than that of the required signal cause the receiver to become virtually dead during the duration of the noise peak. The effect is that instead of the noise appearing in the output louder than the signal, the signal is cut off momen tarily during the noise. It has been found that for certain types of interference, such as static and motor car interference, which consist of short duration peaks of high intensity, a receiver can be operated at a readability that would be impossible without a suppression circuit. In practice the I.F. amplifier is split into two channels, one dealing with the signal I F. only and the other dealing with the noise I.F. onl v. The output of the noise channel is rectified by a diode valve having a delay voltage, which is adjust- able to suit the noise-signal ratio. The D.C. output of this mode is connected in such a way as to cause the b !? S ° n s ig na -l I F. amplifier to increase to cut off and so render the sound channel inoperative. TheA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 93 audio amplifier in superheterodyne receivers follows the practice adopted for T.R.F. receivers. (3) Super-regenerative Receivers This form of receiver employs a special type of detector and in general is only used for ultra short wave reception. As mentioned under T.R.F. receivers, when a detector valve with reaction is used and the reaction increased above a certain point, oscillation sets in, and on a telephony signal there is an audible whistle or beat with the carrier. Therefore it is normally necessary to have the detector in a state of just not oscillating to receive telephony. In this state at ultra-high frequencies, where the losses in the coils, etc., are enormous, the circuit losses have by no means been removed. If the reaction could be increased so as Circuit diagram for straight receiver, suitable for amateur band working, 10-160 metres. Cl Coupling condenser, 50 midget. C2 Band set „ .0002 /xF variable.

Anode decoupling resistance for R.F. stage, 10,000 ohms, and condenser IjiF. to cancel these losses without an audible beat, the sensitivity would be far higher. This result is achieved by introducing into the detector another voltage at a supersonic frequency (above audibility) in such a way that oscillation ceases every half cycle of the supersonic frequency. This frequency is known as the “ quenching frequency.” The quenching frequency is injected into either the grid or anode of the detector valve and is generated in a separate valve, or in certain cases in the same valve. Due to the fact that a valve does not cease func tioning instantly when the grid voltage is increased or the anode voltage is lowered, it is necessary that the quenching frequency should not be too high or else the oscillation of the detector may not have time to stop during a half-cycle of the quenching fre quency. Also the frequency should not be too low otherwise it will be audible as a high-pitched whistle. The voltage injected must be enough to reduce the detector oscillation to zero each negative half-cycle. A quenching frequency of between 10 and 100 kc is suitable for a signal frequency of around 40—60 Me. A super-regenerative detector is not generally suitable for ordinary short-w'ave w r ork and is very little used for the broadcast band, due to the fact that firstly the quenching frequency has to be too low, and secondly because the circuit losses are much smaller and consequently the increase in sensitivity is not so marked. The continual starting and stopping of oscillation causes a continual rushing noise to be produced by the detector when not tuned to a station, but when tuning to a strong signal this noise disappears ; the effect being that of automatic volume control. The selectivity of a super- regenerative receiver is usually poor, being greater with a low-frequency quenching frequency and less with a high-frequency. The sensitivity is very high for the number of valves. This type of receiver is of no use for C.W. reception, due to the fact that no audible beat can be produced and for this reason the transmission must be I.C.W. or phone. Fig. 7 shows a typical circuit of such a receiver. V t is a leaky grid detector of the H.L. class, V 2 is the quenching oscillator valve of the L class, and V 3 is an A.F. amplifier; L,! the aerial coupling coil, L 2 , Cj the grid tuned circuit, L 3 , C 2 the reaction coil and condenser, L,, L 5 the quenching oscillator coils. The variable resistance R 2 is for adjusting the amount of quenching frequency injected into the detector anode circuit, R 3 is a variable resistance giving a fine adjustment of reaction ; R 4 is the A.F. volume control, T 4 is an audio transformer, and the resistance capacity filter R 5 . C 5 is to prevent the quenching frequency overloading the A.F. amplifier. Super-regenerative detectors are sometimes used as the last detector for superheterodyne receivers for ultra short-wave work, a second frequency changer being employed to produce a suitable I.F. This is advantageous because these detectors are noise-discriminating to damped w'aves, such a motor-car interference. Plan view of the superhet receiver, Fig. 9, showing the position of all components on the top of the chassis. I he symbols used coincide with those shown below Fig. 9.94 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO Practical Details Having dealt with the theory underlying the operation of the three types of receiver, we will now briefly consider the relative advantages of various arrangements of receiver and discuss practical details, leaving out the super-regenerative as this has special application to ultra short-wave work only. The simplest type of receiver for a beginner is a two-valve T.R.F. for headphone use. Such a receiver comprises a detector and A.F. amplifier, and under favourable conditions is capable of putting up a very good performance indeed. As an example of this type of receiver Fig. 8 shows the circuit and a list of components for a two-valve receiver covering from 1 • 7 Me to 28 Me with inter changeable coils. This consists of an R.F. stage employing a screen grid valve followed by another screen grid valve as a leaky grid detector.' An L.F. stage may be employed if required but this is not shown on the circuit as it would be conventional in design. The aerial circuit is not tuned but a system of band spreading is used for the detector tuning. Reaction is controlled by C 4 and Rj giving a very fine control. For full details of this receiver the reader is referred to the T. &amp; R. Bulletin dated April, 1937 : “ The Helping Hand.” Part II. The question as to whether or not an R.F. amplifier is advantageous is a debatable point ; it involves an additional tuning control or a ganged circuit, but against this it will remove dead spots or reaction irregularities due to aerial damping on the detector and will give an appreciable gain in sensitivity except below about 28 Me. An alternative is an aperiodic or untuned R.F. amplifier. When we come to the case of superheterodyne- receivers an R.F. amplifier is very necessary in order to provide some amplification before the frequency^ changer. This keeps the signal to noise ratio good. Fig. 9. CIRCUIT DIAGRAM OF SINGLE-SIGNAL SUPERHETB RODYNE RECEIVER.

It is in some cases an advantage to use reaction on the R.F. amplifier; this is often done in mains receivers by tapping the cathode of the R.F valve a few turns up the grid coil (electron-coupled oscillator fashion). Fig. 9 shows the circuit of a single-signal 6-valve superheterodyne receiver described in an issue of the T. &amp; R. Bulletin. This receiver was especially designed for amateur require ment. The apparatus is mounted on a metal chassis ; all coils and valves are screened in suitable me tal cans. In the circuit Vj is an R.F. amplifier, using an R.F. pentode which is transformer-coupled to another R.F. pentode V 2 , operating as an anode bend frequency changer. V 3 is the local oscillator of the electron-coupled type, coupled into the frequency changer grid circuit via L,,, L 3 . V 4 is the I.F. ampli fier valve working at an I.F. of 460 kc, reaction being used to improve the sensitivity and selec tivity, giving single-signal operation. The reaction coil L s is in the cathode instead of the more usual anode, and the amount of reaction is controlled by varying the screen voltage by the potentiometer R 8 . The detector V 5 is of the anode-bend type using an R.F. pentode, the grid bias being obtained by autobias in the cathode lead R 4 , C 21 . The grid bias for the R.F. and I.F. amplifier and the frequency changer is obtained in a similar way. V 6 is the I.F. beat oscillator for C.W. reception and is also of the electron-coupled type and can be switched on and off at will by the switch Sj. This oscillator is coupled into the detector by injection into the screen of the valve. The choke RFC 2 and con densers C 9 , C 10 are to remove any I.F. that may pass to the anode circuit of the detector from the output. The output of A.F. from the jack J is suitable for headphone use, but may be amplified in any suitable A.F. amplifier for a loud-speaker. The R.F. amplifier, like the I.F. amplifier, has provision for reaction in the same way, control being by the potentiometer R 7 , the object being to improve the gain and selectivity of the R.F. amplifier as required. The tuning coils L 2 and L 5 are tuned by the gang condenser C, the small trimmers Cj, C 2 and C 3 are to obtain band spread, and at the same time to trim and pad the circuits. This is necessary as the coils are of the plug-in type, no switching being used. The advantages of tiio superfieteiodyne receiver over the T. R.F. are, a very much greater sensitivity and selectivity, and the possibility ol single signal operation. Due to the h'gher amplification they afford, they give the impression of a stronger back ground noise, but this is to a great extent an illusion, due to the higher signal level at which signals are received. Where a receiver of either type is used for C.W\ reception a tuned filter either incorporated in the A.F. amplifier or in the output is a great advantage. Such a filter is quite simple to construct and should pass a frequency of around 1,000 cycles and reject about 200 cycles on either side. When a filter is used most of the mush and atmospherics are removed, together with signals from stations whose beat-note in the output does not fall within the pass-band of the filter. With regard to aerials used for short-wave reception, the best results are likely to be obtained if the aerial is built in the same way and with the same care as if it were to be used for transmission. A poor aerial will probably receive nearly all the same stations as a good aerial, but the background noise and local interference may be very bad in comparison. In bad cases of local interference aerials of the doublet type having a screened down lead may be used with advantage. In conclusion, it is regretted that the above is only a brief survey of modern receiving technique. In order to cover the subject in detail a series of articles would be required and then they would not be up-to-date for more than a few months. Never theless a wealth of up-to-date practical and theoreti cal information appears in the T. &amp;• R- Bulletin from time to time and readers in search of more specialised treatment of this fascinating subject are referred to that journal.

Nearly all amateurs possess some means of frequency measurement and even the simple absorption meter is invaluable in tuning up a new transmitter for the first time or for changing bands. With the use of modem regenerative crystal oscillators it is quite easy to select the wrong harmonic of the crystal so that an absorption-type frequency meter calibrated in all the amateur bands renders this dangerous error impossible. The Absorption Frequency Meter Fig. 1, (a), (6) and (c) shows the basic circuits for three types of absorption meter, (a) consists of a coil of wire L tuned by means of a variable condenser C. When this circuit is tuned to resonance with an oscillating circuit, to which it is loosely coupled, an H.F. current will flow round the coil and condenser, dependent in magnitude upon the degree of coupling. In the case of an autodyne receiver a click will be heard or, if the coupling is too close, the receiver will stop oscillating. With a transmitter P.A. or frequency doubler stage, resonance is indicated by a small increase in anode current to that stage. If a neon lamp is connected across the tuning condenser, or a flash- lamp bulb connected in series with the inductance, it will be found to glow when the circuit is in resonance with the transmitter. It is preferable to I7U* Lf C3 1 Fig. 1. Absorption Frequency Meter. (A) Basic diagram of fre quency meter.

Me. have the flash-lamp bulb in series with another winding coupled to the tuned inductance because a series connection with the latter increases the resistance of the circuit, making sharp tuning impossible. See photograph of simple absorption frequency meter on next page. The great value in an absorption type of instrument lies in its response only to the frequency determined by the dimensions of the coil L and the capacity C, from which the frequency may be calculated by the formula :—A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 97 Frequency = 2 n * 10« where 2 tt =6-28 L = Inductance in microhenries C = Capacity in Frequency and Wavelength Before dealing with the valve type of frequency measuring instruments it will be advisable to consider briefly the relationship between frequency and wavelength. Most of the contributors to periodicals dealing with broadcast radio matters continue to write in terms of wavelength, but on short wavelengths, in order to be accurate, figures must be given to several decimal points, and for this reason it is preferable to use the equivalent figures in frequency. If the wavelength is required it may be calculated from the formula (1) or by reference to tables : Wavelengths 3 ^ 000 - 000 ^ Frequency in cycles The frequency of an oscillating current is the number of times it reverses per second whereas the wavelength (usually denoted by the Greek letter lambda) is the distance traversed by one reversal or cycle which is dependent upon the velocity of a wave. The velocity of a wireless wave is a constant, given as three hundred million metres per second, hence the formula may be abbreviated as :— = 300,000 X kc The Heterodyne Frequency Meter The heterodyne type of frequency meter employing A simple Absorption Frequency Meter. 1 LB coil, Eddystone type ACBE (12-26 metres). 1 Y „ „ „ ACYE (22-47 „ ). 1 R „ „ „ ACRO (41-94 „ ). 1 W „ „ „ ACWO (76-170 „ ). 1 180 upF scientific S.W. condenser, Eddystone, 1 4-pin Frequentite valve holder, type 949, Eddystone. 1 knob dial and cursor, type 1026. 1 single fuseholder, type F5, Bulgin. 1 piece 1 /16th aluminium, size 10 inches by 3£ inches. a valve oscillator is capable of a high degree of accuracy. Due care must be taken in construction to obtain mechanical rigidity of wiring and components, when calibration permanancy will be ensured. Almost any type of oscillating valve circuit may be calibrated. A dial is affixed to the variable condenser which controls the tuning of the oscillator and one which can be read accurately to fractions of a degree is chosen for the purpose. Messrs. Muirhead market a precision vernier dial which can easily be estimated to one-tenth of a degree, and this, of course, is eminently suitable for frequency measuring instruments. Fig. 3. A Mains-operated Electron-coupled Frequency Meter. Components are same as In Fig. 2, except that R3 and 4 are 10,000 ohms each as potential divider across the H.T. Circuit diagrams for Triode, Dynatron and Electron-coupled frequency meters have appeared from time to time in past issues of the T. &amp; R. Bulletin and these circuits have been selected for their superior stability over circuits chosen at random. The electron-coupled circuit is the most favoured one amongst amateurs of to-day and may be used with either battery or mains valves. With battery valves it is necessary to keep the filaments at R.F. potential above earth, either with H.F. chokes or a specially wound inductance, the latter scheme being perhaps simplest. Figs. 2 and 3 show suitable circuits for both types of valves. The electron-coupled circuit is independent of all reasonable changes in cathode and plate voltages and provided care is taken to secure mechanical rigidity in construction, it will provide an instrument with a high degree of permanence. All components are subject to slight changes in dimensions due to expansion and contraction with rising and falling temperatures. This will result in some slight change in frequency. By the incorporation of a midget trimming condenser across the main variable condenser this may be compensated for and the dial readings will again conform to the calibration chart. It occasionally happens that these temperature changes cancel one another out, but should a frequency meter be found to drift rather badly, this method of adjustment may be found rather useful.98 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO Frequency Meter Monitor Another advantage of the electron-coupled circuit is its ability to supply R.F. from the plate circuit without affecting the stability of the oscillator. By this feature we can make one valve provide a dual purpose of frequency meter and monitor. See Fig. 4. The same result may be achieved by modifying either Figs. 3 or 4 by adding another valve to act as a detector and coupling through a very small capacity with a grid leak of two megohms ; the phones are then placed in the plate circuit of the triode detector. Using the frequency meter as a monitor without a separate detector is not very satisfactory on the higher frequencies. It should be remembered that a signal monitor must be carefully screened as even with low power inputs to the transmitter the local field is too powerful for an unscreened detector. Calibration of Frequency Meters Whenever possible the operation of calibrating a frequency meter should be undertaken by the constructor. Knowledge and experience will be gained by the performance of this task. The calibration of heterodyne frequency meters will be undertaken by the Calibration Section of the R.S.G.B. provided the instrument is of sound mechanical construction and properly adjusted for band-spread. As the band-spreading adjustment necessitates a rough form of calibration it Wl11 be difficult to collect a number of points to form a complete calibration curve. The most useful asset to frequency meter calibra.- tion is in the possession of a 100 kc quartz crystal. This in a properly designed oscillator, will give marker harmonics for all the amateur bands, as well as 100 kc spaced points in between. An experimenter who wishes to carry out regular and systematic measurements of frequency will find that some local form of oscillator is an absolute necessity and at the end of this chapter we describe such a unit. For the calibration of absorption type frequency meters, an autodyne receiver is necessary. A super- het may be used to calibrate a valve instrument but care must be taken to avoid image-frequency effects and if available, it will be safer to use the autodyne receiver for heterodyne frequency meters as well. It is usually preferable to make the calibration curve to fit the 3 • 5 Me band and instead of making the curve in one continuous line split it up into a number of sections as shown in Fig. 5 This will enable the scale to be made more open and therefore more accurate, without having to use an enormous sheet of graph paper. A twelve-inch flexible curve, .obtainable at most drawing offices, will facilitate the actual drawins? of the curves. Cl 25 nfiF Eddystone microdenser. C2 65 ,, Eddystone padding condenser.

The receiver is operated in 14 Me and each of the crystal harmonics from 13,000 kc up to 16,000 kc is heterodyned and tuned to zero beat in turn by the frequency meter. These harmonics will provide points on the 3-5 Me scale 25 kc apart. Further points can be obtained from some of the numerous commercial transmitters which can be heard sending V's and traffic almost continuously, their frequencies being obtainable from the list published in The Amateur’s Call FREQUENCY -Kc Fig. 5. Method of drawing Calibration Curve. Instead of drawing the calibration curve in one continuous line, the above sketch shows how it can be divided up into several sections, thus making a more open scale. Book. Reaction is used on the receiver to locate the crystal harmonic or signal from the commercial transmitter, the reaction may then be reduced to the non-oscillating condition, similar to that required for the reception of telephony and the harmonic heterodyned by the frequency meter which is tuned to zero-beat with it. After this has been done and a note made of the condenser reading, the receiver is again made to oscillate and the next harmonic or signal located, and so on until the whole range has been covered. With an absorption type of frequency meter, instead of reducing reaction on the receiver to the non-oscillating condition, it is tuned to zero-beat with the signal, in a weakly oscillating condition, then by loosely coupling the meter to the receiver, the dial of the meter is slowly turned until the absorp tion of RF from the receiver causes it to cease oscillating. By moving the meter further away, a position will be found where on again gradually moving the meter dial backwards and forwards the receiver just barely stops oscillating. At this point the absorption frequency meter is in resonance with the harmonic or signal on the receiver. The 100 kc Crystal Oscillator Quartz crystals, which are to oscillate on 100 kc, are cut in the form of rectangular plates and are known as 100 kc bars. These are obtainable from advertisers in the T. cS- R. Bulletin together with suitable holders. The purchase of a holder is advisable and the manufacturer’s calibration of the crystal obtained with the holder supplied. The calibration certificate should be given to within plus or minus 0 025 per cent, and anyone proposing to use one of these crystals for monitoring their trans missions when employing electron-coupled master oscillator drive should obtain a check calibration on the complete oscillator circuit. Bar type crystals differ from the usual quartz plates used for controlling the frequency of a transmitter in two important ways. (1) They have a much lower temperature coefficient, and (2) they vibrate in a longitudinal mode. Quartz oscillators of the plate type vibrate in a transverse direction and the frequency is proportional to their thickness. The cross dimensions are not so important except that the usual width lies between £ in. to 1 in. across and a crystal that has been ground to a certain frequency can again be made lower in frequency by reducing the cross-dimensions, but not in the same proportion, as thickness reduction increases the frequency. A transverse oscillator could be manufactured for 100 kc but this would not be such an economical proposition as the bar type owing to the fact that it would be nearly cubical in section and use quite a large piece of quartz. Another disadvantage would be the much higher temperature coefficient which the transverse oscillator possesses. The cross-cut plate or transverse oscillator has a tem perature coefficient of about 23 parts in a million negative per degree centigrade ; this means that a 3-5 Me crystal will decrease in frequency nearly 81 cycles for each rise of one degree in room tempera ture. With the bar type of crystal the temperature coefficient is never more than five parts in a million, providing, of course, the correct cut is made. Out of several tested, it has, in some cases.

It can therefore be said that a bar type of crystal, calibrated at 15° C. over abnormal changes in room temperature, which can be reckoned from 5° to 25° C., never varies more than plus or minus 5 cycles, which makes a difference on the 35th harmonic of plus or minus 175 cycles. This variation is negligible for all amateur requirements and being linear might be easily corrected for if necessary. C* Fig. 6. Triode 100 kc Oscillator.

(Concluded on page 125.)CHAPTER TEN The Ultra-high Frequencies General Characteristics Short and Long Distance Communications Introduction I T is generally understood that the term “ ultra- high frequencies ” relates to those frequencies of the radio spectrum lying between 40 and 224 Me, or, converted into wavelengths, roughly 7 to 1 metre. Below 1 metre, the wavelengths are usually measured in centimetres, and special technique and valves are required, information on which is beyond the scope of this chapter. In the above-mentioned band of frequencies, the part most used by amateurs, and therefore of the greatest interest, lies between 60 and 56 Me, often referred to as the “ 5-metre amateur waveband” and it is with this we shall be chiefly concerned. At the same time much of the following information will apply to the 114 Me (2^-metre) band, more especially when short-distance ground wave com munication is being discussed, and also to the 42 Me (7-metre television) frequency—in this case the general rules for both long and short distances apply. General Characteristics It is now known that both short distances, up to 50 miles or so, and long distances can be covered with 56 Me equipment, and the factors governing the distance will be gone into fully later. There are, however, certain points which must be borne in mind and which hold good, whatever the type of apparatus used. The first of these is the installation of the transmitter and receiver. The higher the station is situated above sea level the better, but as this factor is not usually under control, the next best thing is to see that the aerial system is as high above ground as possible, and clear of external objects. High-frequency feeders to the aerial will often be necessary and care must be taken to ensure that these are correctly matched at both ends, or the advantages of a high aerial will be lost. A special section treats of aerials and feeder systems. Again, since a half wavelength at 56 Me is only 8 feet, it is easily possible for nearby metallic objects with lengths approaching this, or multiples thereof, to develop strong resonances. The effect of these will be to cause signals to be strong in one direction, and very weak in another, usually the desired one ! The only cure for this is either to remove the resonating objects, oftener easier said than done, or to change the frequency slightly, thus altering the pattern of the radiated field, even if it does not cause the resonances to disappear. Whilst atmospherics are only to be heard under the extreme conditions of a local thunderstorm, man-made interference can at times be bad. The chief offenders are the ignition systems of cars, which generally radiate waves occupying a broad band of frequencies between 60 and 30 Me, unless suppressors are fitted to the sparking plugs. This radiation is chiefly over the surface of the ground and if the aerial system is well elevated and the feeders properly balanced, little of it will be picked up. Turning to fading, this is liable to occur on the ultra-high frequencies but the causes are rather different to those producing this effect on lower frequencies, except over long distances, when, of course, the variation in the ionisation of the upper layer still gives rise to fading. Over short distances it i$ due to the movement of objects in the path of the wave, whilst columns of hot air from chimneys and the heated air lying over the earth during the middle of a hot summer day also cause variations of signal strength. Variations in signal strength have been noticed over even short distances of a few miles from day to day and are difficult to explain. Reception varies considerably at different seasons and over periods of years, especially where long distances are concerned. Fading, when it occurs, usually differs from the type experienced on lower frequencies in that, instead of the signal varying between relatively fixed maxima and minima, it reaches momentarily an occasional maximum of great intensity. Echoes, which are sometimes audible on frequencies lower than 30 Me and give trouble to commercial stations, have never been recorded on ultra-high frequencies. Magnetic storms give rise to rushing or hissing noises, rising to a peak and dying away again, but are not so strong or frequent as on the lower frequencies, from which it is assumed that the storm has to be of a very strong nature before it produces an audible effect. Thunder storms, as previously mentioned, occasionally cause atmospherics but have a more noticeable effect on signal strength, which is liable to vary considerably even at a considerable distance from the centre of the disturbance. Short-distance Communication For many years past, the amateur 56 Me band has been used for short distance communication, for which it is very suitable, and use is made of it102 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO in many of the larger centres for across-town work, so avoiding much of the congestion which exists on the lower frequency bands. In this service, it is very difficult to predict the range that may be expected, as so many factors «nter into it. Chief of these is the position of the station—if this is situated on top of a hill, a very •good range, up to 30 miles or so, is possible, but if down in a hollow, it may be found difficult to contact another station only three or four miles away. Tram and telephones wires, buildings of iron girder construction and similar obstructions will cause the range to vary in different directions. If a single vertical half-wave aerial is used, the radiation is omnidirectional, unless affected by nearby resonant metallic objects, but, by the addition of one or more reflectors, or the erection of a multiple array, or both, the strength in one particular direction can be increased to a value which would otherwise require an increase of power at the transmitter of as much as ten times. The 56 Me is extremely popular for portable work and the reason of this is not far to seek. Small aerials can be quite efficient, the actual apparatus can be made small, compact and light, and the power supply derived from dry batteries. Only very low power is usually used, but this is offset by setting up the station on top of a hill in open country, under which conditions a range up to 100 miles is attainable. Two points should be noted here. One is that if it is desired to send out or to receive signals from a particular direction but over a wide angle, it is better to erect the station not right on top of a hill but some little way down the side facing the desired direction. This will result in stronger signals, due to the reflected waves off the surface of the hill adding to the original waves. The other point is that the nature of the ground on which the station is situated may have an effect on its working, as any slight mineral deposit will cause severe attenuation. Moving a short distance often makes a big difference. Thickly wooded and densely populated areas reduce signal strength, whilst ridges and hills may cut it off entirely. Large clumps of trees near the station have a screening effect, greater in wet weather and when they are in full foliage, but one or two isolated trees do not give any trouble, and can often be put to good use in raising the aerial well clear of the ground. Propagation is best over water, as signals suffer only slight attenuation, and the resulting range for a given power will be found to be greater than over land. Successful communication has been maintained between moving cars with the aid of 56 Me portable apparatus, but it is generally difficult to maintain this over a greater distance than three miles, owing to the bad screening that is almost bound to intervene. Equipment has also been used by explorers and mountain climbers for the purpose of keeping in touch, and during the last Mount Everest expedition reliable contact over considerable distances was maintained with low-powered transmitters. The ground wave only is used for short distance work and as a vertical dipole aerial radiates vertically polarised waves, it is necessary, as a general rule, to use receiving aerials in the same plane as that used at the transmitter, otherwise a considerable decrease in signal strength will be found. This rule is sometimes upset by the presence of much wire or metal in the vicinity, and beyond the optical range the plane of polarisation tends to become less clearly defined. In these cases, it is necessary to experiment to find the best angle at which to set the aerial. Transmitters for short distance work are usually of the self-excited type, modulated either by speech or by morse tone signals, the latter giving a greater ran&lt;*e or, if reception conditions are difficult, greater reliability. The frequency modulation and “ spread ” of this type are bad and it is necessary to use receivers of the super-regenerative type. These have the advantages of high sensitivity, ability to discriminate between noise and signal, and very broad tuning, but suffer from a high natural background noise. This disappears, more or less, on tuning in a strong signal but it is difficult to read or identify a weak one. Receivers of this type vary considerably in their effectiveness, according to the design, layout and valves used, these factors having a greater influence than on lower frequencies, and can also cause severe inter ference to other receivers, over distances up to as Long-distance Communication For short-distance work, use is made of the ground wave and, as has been pointed out, the range of this is only slightly greater than the optical distance. For longer distances and also for communication between two points which, while not actually a great distance apart, have much screening intervening, it is necessary to make use of reflected waves, as on the lower frequencies. Up to several years ago, it was thought that reflected waves did not exist and that the Kennelly- Heaviside and Appleton ionised layers simply dispersed the ultra-short waves without reflecting them. A few years ago however, it was proved that under certain conditions, reflection could take place from these layers, and very long distances, across the Atlantic, for instance, and from the East Coast to the West Coast of America, have been covered at different times. “Certain” is a word often used to cover conditions and very often it is left at that and not explained ! In this case, the conditions referred to are when the layers are very heavily ionised and this in turn depends almost entirely on solar activity. When the hydrogen eruptions in the sun are many and violent, under which circumstances they are visible on earth as “ sunspots,” the ultra-violet radiation is greatly increased and the density of the layer is intensified, whilst it is also probable that the “ smoothness” (if we may call it such) of the surface is better than usual, and a much greater proportion of the energy radiated from a U.H.F. transmitter is reflected back to earth. It is necessary that the angle of incidence be very small, some 10° to 15°, and this entails care in the design of the aerial system. It would naturally be thought that when the sun was highest in the sky, the ionisation of the layer would be greatest, but this is not actually the case. The ionisation, it would appear, goes on increasing while the sun is visible and only disperses very slowly, at any rate in the summer, and thus conditions may be expected to be at their best from 3 p.m. until well after darkness has fallen.ually seech eater eater and ssary type.

DUBILIER CONDENSER CO. (1925) LTD., DUCON WORKS, VICTORIA ROAD, NORTH ACTON, LONDON, W.3.A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 105 The Appleton layer is situated 40 miles (approximately) above the earth, and the K.H. higher still, but during 1935-6 a complete new series of layers was discovered by National Physical Laboratory workers. These are situated between the troposphere and the stratosphere, that is, between 4 and 8 miles above the earth. It has been proved that these new layers, which are much thinner than the previously known layers, and which vary but little during the seasons, are capable of reflecting ultra-short waves and this with a fairly high degree of efficiency. The degree of ionisation is not dependent on the radiations from the sun, as it can be quite high during relatively quiet sunspot periods, and the means by which ionisation occurs is not yet definitely settled. It is known that thunderstorms play a large part, and this is curious, since thunderstorms usually occur below the level of the layers, and it would seem that electrons are “ sprayed ” upwards from the thunderclouds. Also, 7 to 8 miles above the earth is a region known as the tropopause, in which temperature inversion occurs, that is to say, instead of the temperature getting lower with an increase of height, the reverse occurs, and this also probably has something to do with the maintenance of the ionisation. (The reader is referred to Fig. 5 in Chapter 2). These low-level layers are responsible for medium distance communication and explain why amateur 56 Me signals sometimes cover unexpected distances, and why the television signals from London are heard much beyond the predicted range of 25 miles. One thing should be noted about the new layers and that is that the angle of incidence of U.H.F. waves should be much greater than in the case of the Appleton layer and this, of course, necessitates maximum radiation from the transmitting aerial at angles between 30° and 60°. A large field of experiment lies open here to find out the effect on field strength at various distances with various aerial systems arranged to radiate at different angles. The solar sunspot activity follows, as is well known, an eleven-years cycle, and we are at present approaching the peak of one of these cycles, it being predicted that the maximum will be reached during 1938-9. The possibilities of reliable and regular long-distance communication on frequencies around 56 Me are therefore increasing every day and it is absolutely essential that as many amateur stations as possible, transmitting and receiving, take advantage of this fact, and spend all the time they can studying conditions and listening for signals. It remains finally to point out that super- regenerative receivers are not suitable for this kind of work, since, for one thing, the background noise is too great to allow of the reception of weak signals, and for another, some kind of modulation is necessary on the transmitted signal, it being impossible to read straight C.W. Further, it is practically hopeless to expect self- excited transmitters to cover great distances for two main reasons. One is that the frequency stability is poor and consequently the signal would be difficult to locate and hold; the other that the radiated wave covers a large channel of frequencies, when the energy should be concentrated into one effective frequency. Transmitters should be either of the long lines or crystal control type. Designs of both types appear in the next chapter. PITMANS RADIO BOOKS - A Selection MODERN RADIO COMMUNICATION (2 vols.) By J.

Order from a bookseller or direct from SIR ISAAC PITMAN &amp; SONS, LTD. Parker StKingsway, London, W.C.2CHAPTER ELEVEN Apparatus for the Ultra-High Frequencies ^ alves—Frequency Measurement Aerials— Receivers—Transmit! ers Introduction I T is mentioned in the previous chapter that much longer distance communication is now taking place with efficient apparatus. Con versely, it is only possible to work or hear another station at a great distance by means of high quality modern transmitters and receivers, and it is undoubtedly well worth while to pay considerable attention to the design of such apparatus, and to include only components which have been specially made for use on the ultra-high frequencies. Fortunately, the amateur is much better off to-day than was the case even a year ago as many manu facturers have recently added to their catalogues a range of components very suitable for inclusion in modern equipment. When choosing components for use in either a ultra-high frequency transmitter or receiver several points should be borne in mind. The chief of these is the insulation, which should be of ceramic or similar type throughout. Bakelite and paxolin should be avoided. Variable condensers should be physically small and mounted well clear of metal chassis, in order that the capacity to earth may be low, whilst the minimum capacity must also be small or the tuning range will be unduly restricted. Radio frequency chokes should have low self capacity and the types with closed rings or masses of metal at the ends are inferior, as the inductance value is reduced and losses introduced. Fixed -condensers should be of the tag type, of small physical dimensions and with mica dielectric. Never use the so-called “ non-inductive ” tubular type in high-frequency apparatus. There is no advantage in using anything larger than -0003 pF, this value presenting minimum impedance. The self inductance -of bigger condensers tends to act as a choke rather than a bypass. In the grid condensers in receivers -00005 pF is quite large enough as the time constant will be too great if a higher capacity is used. The coils in a receiver should not be made of very thick wire, nor should the turns 'be widely -spaced. The reduction in the self capacity between turns through spacing more than one diameter is negligible, but the reduction in inductance is considerable and therefore more turns have to be used to obtain a given value of inductance, thereby increasing the resistance of the coil. The special silver-plated coils made by Eddystone, mounted on •ceramic bases, are very suitable. A compromise has to be struck in the design of transmitting inductances and the use of copper tubing coils is deprecated, as in modern high L/C circuits the current flowing is not high, but the heavy mass of metal in such coils in the extremely rapidly changing magnetic field can give rise to heavy eddy-current losses. No. 12 or 14 s.w.g. wire is quite suitable for powers up to 50 watts, and the skin resistance will be reduced if this is silver- plated by means of the following process. First clean with a scouring powder and polish brilliantly, and then treat with a mixture of J-oz. silver nitrate, J-lb. cream of tartar and f-lb. common salt. Construction should, whenever possible, be made on metal chassis, of copper or aluminium, the stability being thereby improved. All earth returns for any one circuit should always be taken to one point on the chassis, otherwise circulatory currents through the chassis will cause unwanted coupling with other circuits. It is advantageous to put different stages in separate metal boxes, earthing these at one point only ; this principle has been adopted in the superhet receiver described later. It is very important that all leads carrying high- frequency currents be extremely short—every i-inch will make a difference. Many of the wires are actually in the tuned circuit and, if long, will cause trouble in increasing the wavelength beyond that desired, or make it necessary to use a very small Valves W hilst normal valves usually work quite well on the ultra-high frequencies, much better results can be obtained if the special types now available are used, and it will be noticed that these are specified in some of the apparatus described. A valve with high inter-electrode capacities will act, to a certain extent, as a bypass condenser to the excitation or signal voltage and also the inductance value will have to be very small, so that only a low value of dynamic impedance will be attained and efficiency will in consequence be low. 11 is therefore necessary to choose valves with low mter-electrode capacities, but at the same time the mutual conductance must be reasonably high or oscillation will not be obtained easily. Acorn valves are very little bigger than the acorn after which they are called. Up till recently they were only made in America, but several 106A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 107 British manufacturers now produce both triode and pentode types. The connections are brought out to tiny pins on the periphery of the glass and no base is fitted. Quite a useful gain is possible in high- frequency amplifying stages with the pentode type of acorn valve (see chapter 3). The Hivac Co. produce a range of special short-wave valves, fitted with ceramic bases, in which the grid is brought out to a top cap, so increasing the spacing between the output leads. It also enables a more compact layout with shorter inter-valve wiring to be obtained. The PX230 SW type in this range is a very good valve to use in either a self-excited or a driven type of transmitter. A range of midget valves, known as the “ X ” series, is also produced by this firm with low filament consumption, and these are very suitable for inclusion in portable apparatus. Osram market the HL2/K and VS24/K, battery triode and screen grid types respectively, of catkin construction, of much smaller dimensions than normal and with widely spaced output leads. These two valves are very efficient for 56 Me and television work. For low power battery-supplied transmitters, the LP2 valve is probably the most satisfactory, two in push-pull giving a good output with as low as 100 volts on the anodes. Class ' B ” valves, such as the B21, are also very successful. Turning to higher powers, with supply mains available, the amateur is much better off to-day, as quite a number of special valves are now available. Carbon anodes, which allow of greater dissipation before gas is given off, are fitted to some, examples being the Ediswun ES501 and the Taylor T55, both of which will handle 100 watts and more. The Raytheon RK34, a twin high Mu triode, and the Taylor T20, are good valves to use when the input desired is in the region of 25 watts. The higher power Class “ B ” valves, such as the 6A6 and 53, make good self-excited oscillators for inputs of 10 watts. All filament type valves, whether for receiving Fig. 1. Heterodyne wavemeter.

The resistance of a filament, even in a low voltage high current type, is usually five ohms or more and this is in the oscillatory circuit, so that a condenser, which tends to make the filament unipotential, will have a beneficial effect on output. Cathode type valves, such as the RK34, do not require this precaution, but similar condensers should be connected from each side of the heater to the cathode to prevent modulation hum occurring. It is very important that the filament voltage,, measured at the valve holder, be kept at the full rated value. If long leads are used to the filament, the voltage at the source must be rather more than specified, as the performance, both of battery and mains type valves, will fall off very badly if the voltage is even slightly below the rating. This, point is one often overlooked when newly built, apparatus fails to come up to expectations. The special valves, with well spaced electrodes, can as a rule be run at full ratings on 56 Me, but ordinary valves should have the anode voltage reduced, since the internal dissipation will be higher on the ultra-high frequencies, and the life will be shortened. Frequency Measurement Measuring frequencies in the region of 56 Me presents a difficult problem to those who have previously had little experience. It is only too easy to imagine that one is using the correct frequency when in fact it is very many kc away from it. Two types of wavemeter are desirable, one of the absorption type and one of the heterodyne type, the latter being self-modulated and so providing a source of signal voltage for testing and lining up receivers. The absorption type cannot give false indications, but no lamp should be included as this- flattens out the resonance to such an extent as to remove much of the usefulness. A suitable meter can be made by mounting an Eddystone 40ppF micro- denser on a panel with a knob and pointer dial and placing a single turn of wire 2-in. diameter across its terminals. A Po/ar 25 pp.F trimmer is also connected in parallel and this combination will give a good degree of band spread. It will be found unnecessary to place the coil nearer than 3 inches to the receiver coil and resonance will be indicated by a very sharp click in and out of oscillation in the telephones. When used with a transmitter, either look for a kick in the anode milliammeter or place a loop and bulb near the tank coil, and watch for the dimming of this as the knob is rotated. The heterodyne wavemeter is constructed to the circuit shown in Fig. 1. W T ith a good valve, 60 volts^ H.T. will be ample, and the note, which will depend on the transformer and may be anything between 200 and 500 cyles, should be audible in the receiver with many yards intervening. W 7 ith the modulation cut out, the oscillation of the receiver should be audible with the heterodyne meter and vice versa. Both these meters should be calibrated, if possible, by an amateur licensed to use the 56 Me waveband. Failing this, hang up an 8 feet 3 inches length of wire clear of surrounding metal objects and connect to the receiver via a very small capacity, such as an inch or two of wire twisted together. If the receiver is on the correct waveband, a point on the dial should be found where oscillation ceases108 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO (but make sure this is not caused by a choke resonating) due to aerial absorption. Take a reading on the absorption meter and then reduce the aerial wire to 7 feet 9 inches, repeating the process. I he two points so found will roughly indicate the limits of the band. Once this has been found, accurate points can be taken by picking up the harmonic from a calibrated receiver working on 28 or 14 Me and from crystal oscillator harmonics. Aerial Systems Chapter 7 is devoted entirely to aerial systems and. in general, the information and designs given therein will apply equally to aerials for the ultra- high frequencies. At the same time, some remarks on special systems will not be out of place here and the reader will probably appreciate definite data for application on 56 Me. The simplest type one can possibly use is the half-wave end-fed, consisting of a single wire 8 feet or so long (see the table for exact lengths), tapped directly on to the transmitter or receiver, preferably through a very small variable condenser. This aerial may be erected either vertically or horizontally, but for short-distance work the former is preferable. Frequency. Aerial Length. 56 Me 00 4- * 57 Me 8' 2 ' 58 Me 8' 59 Me 7' ior 60 Me 7' 9' Table of lengths for 56 Me aerials. It is possible to improve on the performance of such an aerial very considerably and, if omni directional radiation is desired, further half waves can be added in phase. This simply means adding on further lengths of 8 feet or so, and inserting a phasing coil between each length. The size of the phasing coil, which must absorb a half wavelength (i.e., 2^ metres), should ideally be determined by experiment. The coil will be correct when the aerial system as a whole causes the transmitting valve (oscillating on the desired frequency), to the plate circuit of which it is loosely coupled, to draw maximum current. Start with four turns of 14s.w.g. enamelled wire, one inch in diameter, self-supporting, or, better, cemented to celluloid strips, joined to an insulator which takes the actual strain of the aerial wire. One of the benefits of this type of aerial is that, providing several half waves are used, the top section will be high and well out in the clear and so radiate efficiently, whilst feeders will not be necessary. The addition of a reflector behind the aerial will concentrate the radiation over a fairly wide angle forwards and increase the signal strength in that direction to a degree which would otherwise necessitate a verv considerable increase in the power of the transmitter. If the whole system is made rotatable, transmission can be made in any -desired direction. A good example of this type of aerial is shown in the photograph. The reflector wire is cut 3 inches longer than the actual aerial wire and is spaced one quarter wavelength (approx. 4 feet) behind it. Circuit of a 56 Me field-strength meter for determining resonant frequency of aerial systems. Feeders When the aerial, or aerial array, is erected high up between masts, it is necessary to use feeders to transfer the power to it from the transmitter, or the received signal voltages to the receiver, and greater care is required in the design than on lower frequencies. Unless quite short, plain electric lighting flex should not be used in the construction of feeders, as the losses tend to be high, especially in damp weather. Cab-tyre cable is fairly good, but heavy and unwieldy, and it can only be used where strong support is available. A specially made feeder cable which possesses the desirable qualities of low losses and impedance, strength and lightness is now on the market at a reasonable price, and can be used with confidence. Zepp (voltage) feeders are often more convenient, as they are connected to the lower end of the aerial wire, but where possible it is preferable to use current-carrying feeders to the centre of the aerial. Better than either is the matched impedance type, which can be directly connected to the actual aerial or to what is known as a “ stub ” or matching section. With feeders designed to have an impedance of 600 ohms, the ends can be fanned out to connect to the aerial a foot each side of centre, the aerial remaining in one piece. The low impedance feeder cable mentioned above has a characteristic impedance of 75 ohms and can therefore be connected directly to the centre of the aerial, the impedance of which at the centre is also 75 ohms.■a A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 109 In this case the aerial will be cut, each end con necting to one feeder. When a matching section is used between the feeders and the aerial, the type is known as Johnson ' Q ” and particulars of the design will be found under Chapter 7. The Windom type of aerial can also be used on 56 Me, but it will usually be found that the feeder and aerial both radiate and it is difficult to cure this fault if any length of feeder greater than 20 feet is used. Long Wire Aerials An aerial which is finding increasing favour for long-distance C.W. work is the long horizontal wire used as an end-on voltage-fed, without the use of feeders. It depends for its success on the fact that any length of wire longer than 75 feet will, in all probability, show a resonance, that is, a definite number of half waves, within the 56 Me band. If 117 feet or longer this must happen, and two resonances, one at each end, may be found. It is necessary that the transmitter be adjusted as closely as possible to this resonant frequency, since the radiation falls off very rapidly either side of it. This is not difficult in the case of a self-excited transmitter but where a frequency-controlled transmitter is used the length of the aerial must be adjusted by adding on or chopping off short lengths of wire until the natural frequency corresponds with the working frequency. Now, a multiwave non-phased aerial radiates not equally in all directions but in four lobes at an angle of approximately 15° to the length of the aerial and also at a low angle to the horizon, the actual angle depending on the height of the aerial above the earth. The bearing of the station with which it is desired to communicate is taken from a map (or globe) and the line of the aerial is oriented to correspond with the resulting reading, taking North as shown by the compass. Since true North differs 14° or so from magnetic North, one of the lobes is bound to be directed in the correct direction. Obviously, if this aerial is used at home, communication will be easiest in four main directions and it should be erected with this in mind. It is a good aerial for portable work provided means of support are available. A word about finding the resonant frequency of the aerial is necessary. The only reliable method is by means of an untuned field strength meter and details of this are given in Fig. 2. This should be set up about 8 feet fron the end of the aerial and the transmitter frequency varied until the highest reading is obtained in the F.S.M. milliammeter. It is important that the F.S.M. be of the untuned type, otherwise two adjustments will become necessary and reliance cannot be placed on the results. It will be realised that, whilst the aerial is carrying an even number of half waves, at some intermediate frequency it will also carry an odd number of quarter waves, and act as a Marconi aerial. A lamp inserted in the aerial, close up to the tank coil, will show that there is such a frequency, the lamp lighting at a different frequency to the one previously found. This particular frequency will have prac tically no effect on the F.S.M. and the radiation will be very much lower than when a voltage resonance is used. Various other aerials are available for beaming the radiation in a particular direction over a narrow angle, these including the long armed V-type, Diamond (or Bruce), and Reinartz, but these are more difficult to erect and get working properly, and enough has been said to enable good results to be achieved. Receivers A good deal of information has been published in the past on the super-regenerative, or quench, type of receiver and it is therefore not proposed to include much herein. The super-regenerative receiver has a high degree of sensitivity, but against this it has many serious disadvantages. The background noise, an inherent feature, prevents weak signals being copied, C.W. is unreadable, being heard inverted, the selectivity is extremely poor and severe interference can be caused to other receivers. On the other hand, the background noise of a well made straight type is so low that two L.F. stages can be used, thus providing a high gain to bring up weak signals. A high-frequency stage is recom mended, since although little or no amplification can be expected, the usual advantages of fixed detector loading, elimination of ' dead spots” due to aerial resonances, and independence from a swinging aerial causing signals to wobble, are obtained. Band spreading is more than ever essential, but the condenser capacities are smaller than for lower frequencies, 25 p.p.F being ample for the band-set position and 10 [i.p.F for the tuning or band spreading condenser. Smooth reaction control is very desirable and it will generally be found advantageous to combine the capacity and potentiometer control methods, settirtg the reaction condenser to give weak oscillation and using the potentiometer when searching for signals. This will prevent variation of frequency of the main tuned circuit with reaction control. The two chief troubles encountered with 56 Me receivers are hand capacity and threshold howl. Both depend on the design and if the radio frequency currents are prevented from straying they will not occur. No earth lead is required but a counterpoise 4 feet long will often stop hand capacity effects. Chokes should be fitted in the telephone output leads, and plenty of bypass condensers used. Threshold howl, which is due to H.F. reaching the L.F. stages, is less liable to occur with resistance coupling, and grid stopping resistances will prove helpful in preventing it. Practical Straight Receivers In Fig. 3 is given the circuit of a receiver embodying many modern and desirable principles. It will be seen that the input circuit of the high frequency valve VI is fully tuned, and this is really necessary, as harmonics of commercial stations on lower frequencies may give rise to false signals, if a choke or resistance is used. Tuning is not critical and no slow motion dial is necessary, so that there is little extra complication. The valve can be the Hivac SG220SW with battery operation, or the Osram W42 with mains supply. Both these have the grid connection brought out to the top cap and advantage should be taken of this to make the connection to the tuned circuit very short. V2, theA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 111 consideration. The first is the band width required in the output. For television reception this must be of the order of 2 Me if distortion is to be avoided and full justice done to the transmission, and to accommodate this, a fairly high intermediate frequency of 3 - 5 Me must be used, entailing special I.F. transformers. For our purposes, amateur C.W. and telephony reception, the standard I.F. of 465 kc will be quite suitable and has the advantage that use can be made of the numerous commercial I F. transformers designed to give a high gain at this frequency. The selectivity will naturally be a good deal higher than that of a straight receiver and it may be necessary to purposely introduce resistances across the I.F. transformer windings in order to flatten out the response to allow reception of broad telephony signals. Second channel interference is not likely to be troublesome in the present state of the 56 Me input capacities. The question of “ locking,” that is the local oscillator forcing the incoming signal frequency into step with it, must be considered, as this effect is difficult to avoid. On the whole, an entirely separate oscillator, which for the sake of stability should be of the electron-coupled type, is preferable. The coupling to the frequency changer may be capacitative, inductive or electronic, the last method being by far the best. Either a normal type of frequency changer valve can be used, the generated oscillations being injected via the grid of the oscillator section, or injection can be made via the suppressor grid of a normal high- frequency pentode, if this electrode is separately brought out and not connected to the cathode. This latter method is the most satisfactory, as the suppressor grid is well screened from the input circuit and “ pulling,” “locking” and interaction will be at a minimum. When either method is used, the connections to the grid will have a damping CIRCUIT OF 56 Me SUPERHETERODYNE RECEIVER. Cl .0003 juF T.C.C., type M. R2 5,000 ohms 1 watt Dubilier.

The R.F. stage is also of benefit in removing the aerial loading from the frequency changer valve and in providing a stronger signal to its input grid. The actual process of how the frequency changing is accomplished is very important. There are several valves such as the X41 [Osram) specially made to act as efficient frequency changers on short waves, but it must be admitted that the •efficiency falls off considerably on such high frequencies as 56 Me, due probably to the high effect on the oscillator circuit and experiment is necessary to find the point at which the optimum R.F. voltage is injected. As previously mentioned, care must be exercised in the layout of the ultra- high frequency circuits. The I.F. and output circuits can follow normal practice, more or less, but it should be remembered that a beat oscillator will be required for the reception of C.W. signals. A Practical Example. When one makes up one’s mind to go to the trouble of building a superhet receiver, there is little point in doing things by halves. The valves are the heart and the all-important factors in the working of the receiver, and the design to be112 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO described is built up around three of the acorn type made by Osram, those being used are, (1) a pentode, as a radio frequency amplifier, (2) a pentode, as the frequency changer, using suppressor grid injection, (3) a triode, as an electron-coupled oscillator. The circuit shown, Fig. 4, embodies only the three stages referred to and it is necessary to ensure efficient coupling to the following apparatus, which can, if desired, be a short-wave receiver or even a broadcast receiver, although a properly designed I.F. amplifier will be much more satis factory. Details of such an amplifier will be found elsewhere but a few remarks on coupling to it will be given later. Taking the circuit in detail, the three coils, L2, are identical, being Eddy stone five-turn silver-plated ones mounted on steatite bases. The condensers C5 are also identical, being Webb’s Radio 15 pp-F type, with ganging extensions, and these are not altered in any way, this capacity giving a band spread of the 56 Me band over nearly the whole dial. The condensers C6, Polar midget trimmers on ceramic bases, fulfil two functions, in that they tune the circuits to resonance with each other and also act as band setters. All the components mentioned take up very little room. The grid of VI is tapped down on the second turn from the “ hot ” end of the coil and this is done also with the other grid connections, to give sharper tuning. C5 is connected across the whole coil, but C6 only across the portion between grid and cathode, adjustment being then less critical. R1 controls the bias of VI in the normal way and is therefore the R.F. gain control, normally set for full gain ! The radio frequency choke can be of any good commercial make, but its self capacity must be exceedingly small. The screen grids of both VI and V2 are fed in the common network R3/R3, but separate bypass condensers are used, one in each box. C7, the coupling condenser, is a tiny mica dielectric trimmer set to about half capacity (i.e., 15ppF) or less and it connects to the grid of V2, not to the end of the coil. The heater condensers Cl are there to guard against modulation hum and as both ultra-high and intermediate frequencies are handled by V2, extra condensers C8 are included to deal with the lower frequencies. The third stage is likely to prove the trickiest, as here strong steady oscillation must be maintained over the whole band. Experiment may be necessary to obtain optimum settings but, to begin with, the cathode tap should be connected one turn up from the “cold ’’ end of the coil, and the suppressor grid about a half turn up. This will seem very small coupling to V2, but if the suppressor connection is Using the RK34 as a neutralised power amplifier in long lines circuit. made higher up the coil, operation will become erratic and it may be found impossible to bring the oscillator frequency high enough, even with C5 and C6 set at minimum. As the lead from the coil to the box carries considerable R.F. current, the voltage injected via the suppressor grid is quite adequate. The superhet is constructed with all the components appertaining to each stage in a copper or aluminium box. The resistances should be mounted on small paxolin sheets, the condensers rigidly soldered in the wiring, and the rest of the components firmly bolted to the sides. The first valve is mounted down in one corner so that the anode pin projects through into the second box, so enabling short leads and giving very effective screening. No trouble from instability should be encountered. The suppressor grid connection is run through the sides of the boxes, which are all set up in line, either on a chassis or in a metal box. It is important that only one connection be made between each box. The condensers are ganged together by means of flexible couplers and short extension spindles. A small I.F. transformer can be fitted in the middle compartment (or outside) and twin screened leads run to the I.F. amplifier. If an input transformer is fitted in the amplifier, small condensers of -0001 pF should be interposed between the leads and the input terminals. Alternately, a screened broadcast type choke can be fitted in the superhet where the I.F.T. primary would normally be and a screened lead via •0001 pF condenser taken from the anode of V2 to the input of the amplifier, the return being made via the common earth of the two parts. A condenser should also be interposed if a receiver is used to take the place of the I.F. amplifier, its function being to prevent the inductance of the coil in the first stage being much reduced and consequently the circuit thrown completely out of resonance. Lining Up For this process, a small test oscillator as previously described, Fig. 1, is essential, and this should cover the entire band and give a modulated note of between 300 and 1,000 cycles. A transmitter, suitably modulated, and working on the lowest power at which it will function will also serve. The oscillator can be set 465 kc lower or higher in frequency than the other tuned circuits and the former should be chosen. To begin with, the test oscillator should be placed close to the superhet and set at the high frequency end of the band and the condenser C5 at minimum. C6 of the oscillator stage is then rotated until the output is greatest, preferably measured by an output meter, otherwise by ear. C6, associated with V2, should then be rotated, and it will be necessary to put the oscillator several feet away to obtain a sharp reading. Finally C6, of VI, is adjusted to resonance, and this will be found critical. Set the test oscillator to the low- frequency end of the band and rotate condenser C6, when the note should again be audible before they are fully meshed. Final small adjustments of each trimmer will put the band in the most convenient part of the dial scale. Ultra-high Frequency Transmitters Considerable information relating to the design and construction of the now old-fashioned self- excited tuned plate/tuned grid, Colpitts andA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 113 _ Hartley types of transmitter has been given in previous editions of this Guide and elsewhere, therefore it is not proposed here to go into these details. High-class, properly designed components and much more efficient valves are to-day available to the experimenter, and with these it is possible to build transmitters which give a clean stable output, suitable for C.W. or telephone communication, and which do not call for unlimited time and patience to get going. Before considering driven types of transmitters, there is one particular type which calls for attention and which, although coming under the term ' self- excited,” is in a class of its own. This is the now fairly well known “ long lines ” type, in which resonant copper rods take the place of the normal tuned circuit. The inductance of the rods is set to such a value that with the distributed capacity and the valve inter-electrode capacity, resonance occurs at the desired frequency, and the valve will only oscillate at this frequency. If the rods are made very rigid and firmly supported to prevent vibration, the output is very steady and unaffected by external influences. Whilst a single valve may be used, it is usual to use two valves in push-pull, this having the advantage of putting the inter-electrode capacities in series, and so halving their effective value. Since the grids exercise the greater control, rods should be used in the grid circuit, two being used in parallel, separated by a distance of two inches, their lengths, which are governed by the valves used, being somewhere between three feet and four feet. The anode circuit may, if desired, be the normal coil and condenser, but it is better to use rods here also, so obtaining a very high L:C. ratio and con sequently a high impedance load for the valves. Adjustable shorting bars are fitted across each pair of rods to enable the frequency to be adjusted. A practical circuit is given in Fig. 5, this being an example of a transmitter employing grid ” long lines ” and the usual coil and condenser in the anode circuit. The valve is the Raytheon RK34, a double triode especially developed for ultra-high frequency transmission with inputs between 5 and 25 watts. It has a unipotential cathode, which prevents carrier modulation when A.C. is used for filament heating. The grid lines consist of £-inch copper tubes 40 inches long, spaced 1|- inches between centres. The anode circuit may, if desired, be identical, the H.T. being fed via the choke to the shorting bar, but as shown, it consists of a coil of three turns T 3 ff -inch tubing, 2 inches diameter and an Eddystone 20[X[jlF microdenser. The aerial coils are one turn each and the condenser, C2, 40 p.jxF. If anode lines are used, aerial coupling may be either by direct tapping(s) or by a ' hairpin ” supported above the lines and tuned in the \isual way.

Driven Transmitters There has, in the past, been a certain amount of difficulty in getting satisfactory results, with efficiency and economy, from a driven type of transmitter on the U.H.F. but it is now possible to construct an efficient transmitter, using only three valves, for a very reasonable outlay, and readers are urged, especially if they are interested in long distance communication, where the tone of the signal will make an enormous difference, to build one on the lines described, rather than experiment with a simple self-excited affair. Since exciter units for providing the initial drive required are discussed earlier in the Guide; there is no need to go into them in detail here. A word must, however, be said about crystal versus electron coupling control. The former should be used if at all possible, in order to ensure absolute steadiness of the final frequency. In the case of electron coupling, if used, every precaution should be taken to ensure not the slightest frequency drift or vibration can occur, since if the first circuit works on a frequency in the region of 3,500 kc and the final on 56,000 kc, a multiplication of 16 has taken place and any variation will be multiplied by this amount.114 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO The chief requirement of the final stage of a transmitter is ample driving power and this has been one of the difficulties which have had to be overcome. As explained previously, the various stray capacities of the components and values employed have had the effect of partly bypassing the available energy and also reduced the size of inductance employable, so reducing the available R.F. voltage across the tuned circuit, often to a value insufficient to drive the final valve to any degree. It must therefore be borne in mind that considerable more R.F. driving power must be provided than normally called for by the final valve in use. Front view of 50 watt, 56 Me C.C. transmitter, with panel removed. From 28 Me upwards, capacity coupling will not be suitable and separate tuned circuits, either inductively or link-coupled, become essential. The ratio of inductance to capacity in the anode circuits must be kept as high as possible, in order to allow high R.F. voltages to develop. The final valve will usually be fed with the output from a 28 Me stage and act as a doubler to 56 Me but there is no reason, providing care in the layout is exercised, why another valve, acting as a straight amplifier on 56 Me, should not be added, with a worth-while increase in output. Another good arrangement is to drive the grids of two valves in push-pull, connecting the anodes in parallel. The output tank circuit will receive a “kick” every half cycle instead of every cycle and consequently the output, on double the frequency, will be greater than with the usual connections or with one valve. Ihe circuit for push-pull doubling, as it is called, when using the RK34 valve is shown in Fig. 6, and it will be seen that neutralising is required, both neutralisirg condensers being connected to that side of the tame coil remote from the anodes. Split stator condensers of 25 ppF total capacity are necessary in both grid and anode circuits in order to preserve symmetry and prevent parasitic oscillation. A Practical 3-Valve Transmitter This description of a practical transmitter must be brief, but the circuit diagram, Fig. 7, and the photographs will give the essential details of the design. Points of interest to note are that the final frequency may be either 28 Me, with an output power in the region of 40 watts, or 56 Me with an output of about 25/30 watts, the number of adjustments is comparatively few, and cathode biasing is employed throughout, so that in the event of excitation failing, no harm from excessive anode current can happen to any of the valves. The first valve is a Raytheon 6L6, known as the beam power tube, of pentode type, but not having a suppressor grid. This valve has acquired a name for itself through its high efficiency in turning D.C. into R.F. energy. A Q.C.C. 7 Me crystal is employed in a tritet circuit, and the cathode coil LI, consisting of six turns 18S.W.G., inches diameter, is wired directly in. Note that this coil must be small in order that C2 may have a high value and act as an efficient bypass to the R.F. energy developed in the anode circuit. A 60 mA fuse bulb, not shown, should be included close to one electrode of the crystal and at no time should this show more than a small glow, or damage to the crystal may result. L2 is wound on a four-pin Eddystone former, the yellow spot main winding of nine turns being correct, the other being removed. In the diagram, C4 couples the first valve to the second, but an improvement has since been effected by replacing it with a winding of 12 turns, 26 S.W G. wire on the same former as L2, about 1 inch below the main winding. One end of this connects to the grid, the other to the chassis via the grid leak, R3, which is bypassed by a -0005 pF condenser. This inductance, being resonant over a wide frequency band, requires no tuning condenser, and cuts out the parallel connections of C4 and the R.F.C. The second valve, which doubles from 14 to 28 Me, is also a6L6,the anode coil being five turns, 18 S.W.G. on an Eddystone former, the link winding consisting of two turns of the same wire, connected to the other pins. The screen voltage is fed via a potentiometer R5, which may be a fixed Bulgin 20 watt type with a tapping clip, or a Varley 30,000 ohm variable, the latter giving a ready control of excitation. R4 are decoupling resistances and each screen is separately bypassed to the chassis. Keying is effected by breaking the lead to the screen grid of the second valve, and, with the small filter employed, is absolutely clickless. Should there be a slight tail in the note, a 100,000 ohm resistance connected from the screen grid to earth will cure it. All bypass condensers should be connected straight from the valve holder or condenser to chassis. Either one side of the heaters or the centre tap in the trans former may be connected to the chassis.A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 115 The final valve is a Taylor T20, having the anode brought out on top. It is used as a straight neutralised amplifier on 28 Me and as a regenerative doubler on 56 Me. It may be mentioned here that whilst pentodes work well on lower frequencies, they are generally unsuitable on the U.H.F. as, due to the number and close spacing of the internal electrodes, the input capacity is high and the benefit of requiring small driving power is lost. The grid coil is identical with L3, the link windings being connected together with a short length of heavy power type flex. C9 must be of the split stator type and this can either be made up of two condensers ganged together or purchased as a unit. so that the anode current doubles, and tuning C3 for maximum output. This condenser will be practically at minimum, as also will CIO and C9. The actual anode current will vary according to the setting of the tapping on R5, the maximum being about 40 mA. CIO of V2 is then tuned for the anode meter dip and CIO of V3 for maximum drive. The final valve must be neutralised before H.T. is applied or it may go off into oscillation with high anode currents. This is done by holding a lamp and loop over the grid coil and adjusting C8 until rotating C9 has no effect on the glow of the lamp. With the coils specified C9 will be very near minimum capacity on both 28 and 56 Me. Fig. 7. CIRCUIT OF 56 Me CRYSTAL CONTROLLED TRANSMITTER. Cl .001 m F T.C.C., type M. C2 .00025 uF Polar.

L4 and L5 are identical coils, being ' R V.” inductances wound of 14S.W.G., three turns 2 inches diameter for 56 Me, and six turns for 28 Me. R1 can, if desired, be connected direct to earth without any biasing battery. A meter is desirable to measure the grid current flowing and the working bias will be found by multiplying the grid meter reading by 10 and adding to it the anode current reading multiplied by - 2 .

[Concluded on page 125.)116 CHAPTER TWELVE % \ i Measuring Instruments Moving Coil—Moving Iron—Metal Rectifier—Thermal Meters—Changing Instrument Ranges—Circuit Testers—Simple Bridge Measurements W HEN designing or operating transmitting and receiving apparatus it is necessary to take measurements of the currents and voltages in the circuits involved in order to obtain satisfactory results. The instruments required for this purpose must be reasonably accurate and robust and cheap enough to be within the reach of the amateur’s pocket. Of recent years, many firms have produced small instruments with the qualities mentioned, and very suitable for amateur requirements. These instruments cover a wide range of measurements which may be divided into the following classes :— (1) Direct current measurements. (2) Mains frequency alternating current measurements. (3) Audio frequency alternating currents. (4) Radio frequency alternating currents. No one instrument can be made to deal with all these quantities, so a meter must be chosen of a type most suitable for the particular work in hand. It may be required to measure direct currents ranging from microamperes to many amperes, and voltages ranging from microvolts to many thousands of volts, while the alternating currents and voltages of similar magnitudes which have to be dealt with may have frequencies ranging from a few cycles per second to many millions of cycles per second. D.C. Instruments—The Moving Coil Meter The most practical and most widely used instru ment for measuring direct currents and voltages is the moving coil meter. In this instrument a coil of wire, usually rectangular in form, is mounted on pivots in the field of a permanent magnet. When the current to be measured flows through the windings of the coil, it is caused to rotate, thus moving a pointer across a scale and giving an indication of the current. The current is led into the coil through hairsprings mounted at each end of it ; these springs also serve to control the movement of- the coil and to restore it to its normal position when the current ceases to flow. The range can be varied when measuring voltages, by putting resistances in series, so losing some of the applied voltage in the resistances, and when measuring current, by putting shunt resistances in parallel with the coil, thus bypassing some of the current through the shunts. A moving coil movement (with a thermocouple incorporated) is shown as a drawing in Fig. 4. Moving coil instruments can be made highly sensitive, that is, a large deflection can be obtained for a very small power consumed in the instrument, so that an accurate reading can be taken without appreciably altering the quantity to be measured. For instance, if one measured a small high tension battery, as used in radio receivers, with a voltmeter which took 100 mA from the battery, the battery volts would drop and an inaccurate reading would be obtained. A moving coil meter, however, could be made to read the volts and take say only 1 mA, which would be well within the intended discharge rate for the battery, and would not appreciably alter its voltage. Many instances such as this occur in radio work, where the quantities to be measured are small. Fig. 1. A 50 mA moving coil meter made by Ferranti, Ltd. D.C. instruments of this class are made in various ranges from 0-1 mA to 0-500 mA. 0-.75 amps, to 0-30 amps. 0-100 microamps to 0-500 microamps. 0-2.5 volts to 0-500 volts. The voltmeters usually have a resistance of 200 ohms per volt but the 0-500 volt model is made 500 ohms per volt. The models of ranges 0-150 volts 0-250 volts and 0-300 volts are also made with resistances of 1,000 ohms per volt. Moving Iron Instruments For measurements on A.C. circuits of mains frequencies and where the current taken by the instrument is not of importance, moving ironA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 117 instruments can be used. They are cheap and robust and can also be used for D.C. measurements if a high degree of accuracy is not required. In these instruments a fixed iron and a moving iron are mounted in the magnetic field at the centre of a coil through which the current to be measured is passing. Under these conditions a mutual repulsion exists between the two irons and the moving iron is deflected, thus indicating on a scale the current being measured. Fig. 2. An Elliott Brothers’ edgewise pattern moving coil meter with top cover removed to show interior. These instruments are made in many ranges and are usually 200 ohms per volt for voltmeters, although for certain ranges they are made 1,000 ohms per volt. Metal Rectifier Instruments The metal rectifier instrument is very useful for measurements on mains frequency alternating current, and on alternating currents of audio frequencies. It cannot be used on radio frequencies or on D.C. The instrument consists of a moving coil meter into which has been incorporated a Westinghouse metal rectifier. Most of the advantages of the D.C. moving coil instrument are retained in the metal rectifier instru ment. The power consumption is low and the sensitivity is high, rendering the instrument very suitable for measuring low alternating currents (microamps) and small A.C. voltages. For instance, the audio volts across the loudspeaker terminals can be measured with one of these instruments. They can be made to read with a reasonable accuracy up to frequencies of 20,000 cycles per second. Thermal Meters Thermal meters can be used very effectively for measuring alternating currents of all frequencies, including audio and radio frequencies. These instruments consist of a moving coil type meter into which is incorporated a thermocouple or thermo-j unction. When the current to be measured is passed through the “ heater ” to which the couple is attached, the rise in temperature produces an E.M.F. in the couple which deflects the meter and enables the current to be read. The couple consists of a junction of two dissimilar metals, such as Chromel and Eureka, and is attached to the heater by means of a bead of high thermal conductivity material, which has good electrical insulation properties. Fig. 3. An Elliott miniature round type of moving iron meter of 100 volt range. Meters of this type consume 1 volt-amp on the 3 volt range, 2 volt-amps on the 100 volt range, and 2.8 volt-amps on the 300 volt range. The power consumption of the ammeters in this class is .25 volt-amps. For high ranges, an open type junction is used, but for more sensitive ranges a vacuum type is used (Fig. 5) to prevent temperature changes and losses. Fig. 4.

The thermal meter is the only type of instrument which can be used for the measurement of radio frequency aerial and feeder currents with any degree of accuracy.118 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO A type of instrument known as the “ Hot-wire Ammeter ” has been used extensively in the past for H.F. measurements, but while its readings can be useful in a relative way, its accuracy at high radio frequencies is very rarely reliable. Its sole merit is that of cheapness. I Fig. 5. An Elliott vacuum type Thermo-junction. These Thermo-junctions are made in various ranges measuring trom 10 mA up to 12 amperes. The power consumption from the 25 mA range is 20 milliwatts and for the 5 amp. range is 1 watt. Electrostatic Instruments Where even a small load, taken by the measuring instrument from the quantity to be measured, introduces a considerable error, the Electrostatic Voltmeter is used. The instrument consists of a set of fixed metal plates interleaved with, but not touching, a very delicately suspended set of moving plates. When a voltage is applied across these sets of plates there is a mutual attraction and the moving plates are deflected. As the instrument is essentially a condenser, it must be used with care in radio frequency circuits where its capacity might alter the conditions of the circuit. Instrument Ranges Very often it is useful and convenient to be able to alter the range of an instrument so that a wider range of measurements can be made with it. 1. The Voltmeter. In the case of a voltmeter a certain voltage-drop occurs across the instrument, which drop is fixed by the design of the instrument. Any voltage can be measured directly by means of the instrument provided it does not exceed that voltage required to produce a full-scale deflection of pointer. If a higher voltage is to be measured a series resistance must be provided to drop the excess volts. Fig. 7. Interior view of a Ferranti Electrostatic 3,500 volt Volt meter. Note the safety resistance in series. Smaller meters of this type can be obtained with full scale readings of 150v and upwards. Fig. 6. A Ferranti Electrostatic Voltmeter. The instrument is not very sensitive, so it can only be used for measuring high voltages in general, although of late more sensitive models have been made. A typical example of its use is the measure ment of the audio volts across the modulation choke in a speech transmitter, or the measurement of actual D.C. anode volts on a valve without introducing errors due to increased D.C. resistance drop in the anode resistance. Thus, suppose a full-scale deflection is produced on a certain instrument when one volt is applied to its terminals, and it is required to measure 100 volts. Then a series resistance of 99 times the resistance of the meter would be required in series with it so that a voltage drop of one volt would occur across the instrument and a voltage drop of 99 volts would occur across the series resis tance. In Fig. 8A, let R be the resistance of the meter in ohms, Rg the resistance of the series resistance in ohms, V the voltage across the meter and V s the voltage across the series resistance ; then the value of the series resistance is:— „ RXV S Rs=—y— so that a voltage of V-fV s could be measured by means of the instrument. 2. The Ammeter or Milliammeter. When a simple shunt is used in the case of an ammeter the voltage across the instrument and the voltage across the shunt resistance are the same, because they are connected in parallel. If a current in a circuit is to be measured which is higher than that required to produce a full scale deflection of the instrument, a resistance capable■1 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 119 of carrying the excess current must be put in parallel with it. In Fig. 8B let i be the current in the instrument, i s the current in the shunt, R the meter resistance in ohms and Rs the resistance of the shunt in ohms. Then the resistance of the shunt is:—■ i R s = . R where the current to be measured is J + *s- Thus, suppose we had a milliammeter of 10 ohms D.C. resistance and of which the full scale deflection was obtained when one milliampere was passed through it, and a current of 100 milliamperes was to be measured for full scale deflection. Then a shunt must be provided which would carry the VAA/VWA V + Vs 4 4*- -AWWWWAAM— «s (&amp;) A '-AWV^WWWVW 1 (O') Fig. 8.

The Universal Shunt. A useful type of shunt which can be attached to any instrument is shown in Fig. 8C. The shunt consists of a high resistance, AB, which is connected to the instrument. The current i enters at A &amp;nd if it left at B the current in the iRg instrument would be p . If the current is made to leave at C the resistance Rs of AC being — the current in the instrument tR s would now be , 0 , r , . w(K + R s ) So the current in the instrument is reduced by ^ X its original value by making it leave at C instead of at B. If several points on AB are made for C having different values for n, a range of currents can be measured. It should be noted that for a given position of the tapping point C, the shunt value will be the same for any meter, irrespective of the latter’s resistance. Circuit Testers A very useful piece of apparatus which is now available to amateurs at a reasonable cost is the Circuit Tester or Test Set. In the Circuit Tester, a meter, usually a good moving-coil type, is combined with a range of shunts and series resistances, in a case of portable form, and is capable of being used for many kinds of measure ments. The shunts and series resistance are arranged so that they may be changed by means of switches or by plugging the test leads into appropriate sockets or by a combination of the two methods. Such instruments are the Weston Test Set, the Ferranti Circuit Tester, and the ' Avo ” range of instruments. A Ferranti Circuit Tester for A.C. and D.C. tests is illustrated in Fig. 9. Many of these instruments are fitted with an internal battery so that a range of resistance measurements can be made. Fig. 9. Ferranti A.C.-D.C. Circuit Tester. For measurement of A.C. voltage, D.C. voltage, D.C.mA and resistance. A metal rectifier is fitted in most of the instru ments which enables them to be used for A.C. measurements. A typical circuit of a Circuit Tester is shown in Fig. 10.120 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO To adjust the instrument for resistance measure ments P is adjusted with the switch at ‘‘ -f- ” to give a scale reading marked “ + ” and to zero reading by means of R with the switch in the 1,000£} position. In both adjustments the instrument terminals are short-circuited. In the Circuit Tester shown, a range of voltages, currents and resistances as indicated on the stud- switch can be measured, the necessary series resis tances, shunts and adjustment resistances being connected to the moving coil meter by means of the stud switch and the coupled switches Sj, S 2 and Sa por the voltage measurements an ordinary series resistance tapped for various ranges is used. It will be noted that the universal shunt described earlier in this article is employed for the current ranges. A rheostat is provided for use in controlling the currents in circuits in which the instrument is used to measure the current. The variable resis tances P and R, are for use when setting up the instrument to measure resistances, and to enable variations in the battery voltage to be allowed for, as the battery, which is self-contained, runs down. The Wheatstone Bridge For more accurate measurements of D.C. resistance than can be made with a Circuit Tester a simple Wheatstone or Resistance Bridge is employed. This consists of two known resistances R t and R 2 which are termed the “ ratio arms,” a variable calibrated resistance R 3 , and the resistance to be semes Resisross Fig. 10.

These are connected to a battery and a galvanometer as shown in Fig. HA. If R is varied until the ratio of Rj to R 3 is equal to the ratio of R 2 to R 4 the potentials at A and B will be the same, and the galvanometer will not be deflected. The bridge is then said to be ” balanced ” and the value of the unknown resistance can be calcu lated from the known values of Rj, R 2 and R 3 and The range X of measurements obtained on a Wheatstone bridge can be extended by varying the values of the ratio arms. The greatest sensitivity is obtained when the resistances are similar in value. A. The circuit of a Wheatstone or Resistance Bridge. B. A simple Capacity Bridge. A Simple Capacity Bridge A simple capacity bridge is shown in Fig. 11B. The principle of operation of this bridge is the same as that of the Wheatstone bridge. The known ratio arms Rj and R 2 can be a calibrated potentiometer of, say, 10,000 ohms. C 1 is a condenser of known capacity preferably similar in value to the capacity of the condenser to be measured, C 2 . A source of tone, such as a low frequency valve oscillator or a buzzer circuit, is applied to the bridge as shown in Fig. 11B, and the ratio of R 4 to R 2 is adjusted until no sound is heard in the headphones. An absolutely silent point may be impossible to obtain but a minimum position can be found. The value of the capacity C 2 when the bridge is Ri balanced is given by C 2 =^ C,.

All experimental work on the transmitter can be carried out with it and a useful insight into the working of the different stages can be obtained. Details concerning the method of applying for an artificial aerial licence are given in a latter chapter. A Post Office licence is necessary before any trans mitting apparatus is used. Fig. 1. A simple artificial aerial. A simple artificial aerial circuit is shown in Fig. 1. R is a non-inductive resistance preferably of 500 ohms resistance using a short thin resistive element (to prevent standing waves at very high frequencies, and to have a low resistance-frequency coefficient), C a variable tuning condenser and L a suitable inductance so that the whole can be tuned by C to the required frequency. This is the Artificial Aerial proper ; it dissipates nearly all the H.F. output from the transmitter. The associated equipment men tioned above consists of components used for feeding the H.F. into the Artificial Aerial and monitoring it. The simplest method of feeding is obviously inductive coupling between L and the anode circuit of the valve concerned : it is electrically a very sound method, but practically it is hard to carry out in a convenient manner. The next simplest is by capacity coupling to the anode of the valve ; a small variable condenser of 35{xp.F capacity being inserted between the anode and the Artificial Aerial : this is not very good practice as it upsets the tuning and neutralising (if any). The soundest method of all, both convenient and effiicient, is to use link coupling—two coils (each having about 10-20 per cent, of the turns of the main coils) are coupled to L and the tank coil, and connected together by either spaced feeders or flat twin cab-tyre cable. The measuring equipment is, perhaps, the most important part, and on this the amateur can spend all his time, ingenuity and patience. The charac teristics of the H.F. required are:—(a) magnitude ; (b) quality of phone and C.W., degree of key clicks and hum ; (c) percentage modulation ; and (d) fre quency ripple or chirp, (a) can be quite easily measured in arbitrary units by putting an H.F. ammeter in series with R, or by measuring the voltage across L by, say, a diode rectifier ; (b) can be heard on a monitor—either a shielded receiver or a diode rectifier; (c) can only be properly measured with a cathode ray oscillograph, but results of a sort are obtainable with simple peak voltmeters—either peak diode or slide-back types using anode bend or diode detectors ; (d) can be heard either by listening on a very stable frequency Fig. 2.

It appears at first sight that a diode rectifier can be used for everything in the artificial aerial, ■which is true, but unfortunately the load circuit for A view of the complete artificial aerial equipment. measuring modulation is quite different from, that of, say, phone monitoring. For a description of a modulation meter the reader is referred to chapter five. A useful check on the modulation is to couple a single turn of heavy wire with a flash-lamp bulb in series to the coil L, adjusting the coupling so that the bulb lights on the carrier without modulation. On applying speech modulation to the transmitter the bulb should flash slightly brighter on peaks of modulation, this flashing indicates a modulation of around 80 per cent. With this exception of modulation measuring, then, a diode rectifier can monitor and measure a transmission fairly com- Pl XheTcircuit of a complete artificial aerial equip ment is shown in Fig. 2, and the practical layout is shown in the photograph. The constructional details are both simple and obvious ; it is necessary however to say a few words about Rx- The resistance should be short in length and the wire should be of small gauge to prevent skin effects. A limit is set, however, by the heat it has to dissipate, and in the original model the wire off a 50,000 ohm Colverstat was used and arranged in zigzag form across four miniature Eddystone insu- l itors: the 20 in. used had a resistance of 350 ohms ; the wire is very delicate—less than 2 mils, in diameter—and so is protected by the case of tinplate shown which is earth. The values of the com ponents are clearly dependent on M s full scale reading : those given assume M is a 0-5 milliam- meter. R 2 , R 3 and R 4 adjust the range of the diode. Very approximately, full scale reading is given by W watts (D.C. to valve) when W thousand ohms are in circuit. This can vary by 100 per cent., depending on the other constants used in the circuit. For convenience, the LT switch S s is ganged to the potentiometer. For monitoring phone or key-clicks, phones are plugged into J. Another method of providing a resistance to dissipate the output power of the transmitter and at the same time measuring the power output is to use a lamp of suitable size as the resistance R or alternatively to tap the lamp directly on to the tank coil of the transmitter or on to the feeder coupling coil in such a way as to get a suitable impedance match, the rating of the lamp being chosen so that its resistance and the wattage are of a suitable order. As a guide for the choosing of lamp ratings a set of curves for the usual available sizes of lamps was published in the January 1937 issue of the Bulletin. The simplest method of using lamps in order to measure power output is to employ a photometric method known as a ' grease spot photometer.” This photometer comprises two similar lamps and Photometric method of measuring power output. Procedure:—Set up transmitter and light load lamp “A.” Switch on lamp “B.” Adjust the position of spot card until it appears equally illuminated from one side. Switch off transmitter and change over lamp “A” to D.C. supply and adjust D.C. voltage till card is again equally illuminated. Measure D.C. watts. ^4A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 123 MULLARD CATHODE RAY TUBES FOR TELEVISION AND OSCILLOGRAPH PURPOSES Television Tube Type E.46-12 Price 15 Gns.

One lamp is lit from the transmitter output and the other from an AC or DC mains source or from a battery supply, the input to the latter lamp being capable of adjustment and measurement by suitable rheostat and meters. If the voltage on the second lamp is adjusted, a value will be found where the grease spot becomes invisible, i.e. the trans mitted and reflected light on the spot are equal. When this condition is arrived at, the wattage dissipated in each lamp is equal. The arrangement is shown in Fig. 3. A photo-electric exposure meter as used for photography if available can be arranged instead of the grease spot or can be calibrated to read watts at a given distance from the lamp and will give excellent results.

A patch of thick rubber floor covering in front of the transmitter will possibly prevent a serious shock if the positive H.T. terminal should acci dentally be touched, but it is more desirable to acquire the habit of never touching any part of the circuit with the power on rather than using devices which make it safe to do so. A further aid to safety is the practice of properly earthing all metal parts of the apparatus which are not actually part of the circuit. This applies for example to lead sheaths and metal conduits carrying wires, cores of smoothing chokes and transformers and the metal cases of all condensers. The practice of using double-pole switches is strongly recommended, not only with a view to completely isolating the mains voltage but also to prevent a circuit remaining alive even with the switch open due to an earth contact at an unsuspected point.

It will be noted that this result appears to be inverted relative to that obtained on the Wheatstone bridge when measuring resistances. This is due to the fact that the impedance of a condenser is inversely proportional to its capacity. With care the simple capacity bridge described can be very useful, but it must be realised that it will not be accurate for measuring very small capacities below, say, 100 puF, due to the capacity unbalances of the headphones and the ratio arms. In conclusion it should be stated that the measure ments described are only of the simplest kind, but it is hoped they will be of help to readers anxious to understand more thoroughly what they are doing.1 ; CHAPTER FOURTEEN Television Fundamental Principles — Scanning — Frequencies Involved Mechanical Transmission — Photocells — Electronic Transmission Cathode-Ray Tube Receivers Introduction HE striking development of television during the last few years has provided the amateur with an attractive new field for experiment. The production and transmission of television signals is inherently more complex and certainly more costly than that of C.W. or telephony. How ever, a few amateurs have done good work in that field, generally with non-radiating equipment, but the majority have found the cost of transmitting experiments too great for their pocketbooks. The preliminary broadcasting of Baird 30-line signals by the B.B.C. gave rise to a period of receiving activity since the transmissions could be picked up with inexpensive equipment. Unfortunately the service was short-lived and the results possible from it very moderate, but there can be no doubt that the experience and knowledge gained proved useful to many. The present high definition service will remain unchanged in essentials for at least two years ; thus a field for a wide range of receiving experiments has been opened up, the cost of which need not be excessive. In this chapter it is proposed to outline only the system of television in use to-day in this country, explaining it sufficiently to give an indication of its amateur aspects. An attempt will also be made to show the directions in which investigations can most simply and profitably be carried out. Tele vision methods are still very far from finality and there is room for ample improvement even in the receiving equipment alone ; moreover, compara tively little is known about the ultra-short wave lengths which are being used, or the best methods for utilising them. The amateur is particularly well placed for work of this kind, in which simultaneous observations from many points can be collected to throw light upon the behaviour of these waves. Already unexpected results are coming to light, and the experience gained cannot fail to stimulate the development of the 28 and 56 Me amateur bands. Fundamental Principles Television involves the reproduction of a scene with all its details and movement at a distant receiver, employing a radio or cable communication channel to transmit the necessary signals. As in the case of speech, which is translated into electrical variations by the microphone before transmission as radio telephony, some method must be found of translating the scene into an electrical form suitable for the modulation of a carrier wave. What are the factors which make up a scene ? First, there are the changing values of light and shade pertaining to each part. These can be trans lated into variations of potential with the help of the photo-electric cell, which can then be used to control the amplitude of the carrier. The brighter the illumination, the greater the carrier amplitude, just as in telephony a loud sound results in deep modulation; actually the momentary increase in the mean carrier of a ‘‘ controlled carrier ” system is a better analogy. Second, there is the factor of colour. This cannot easily be transmitted, and it is omitted from present television methods, the scene being reproduced in monochrome just as are most photographs or illustrations. The only satisfactory methods known for coloured television involve the sending of separate images for the three primary colours, and the recombination of these in the receiver on lines analagous to colour printing. To achieve this involves so much additional equip ment and general complication that it is not considered practicable at present. Similar remarks apply to the transmission of stereoscopic vision, giving the impression of solidity which is obtained through the combined use of two eyes. This might be possible if two television images were transmitted as viewed from two points separated by the distance between the eyes, but the duplication of equipment needed makes this also beyond our present scope. The scene is therefore viewed from a single point by a single lens, and is reproduced in a plane just as in cinematography. To do even this effectively, taxes our technical resources to the utmost. Scanning There remains the most essential factor of all which goes to make a scene, viz. the relative positions of all the objects which compose it. Desirable as it would be, it has proved impracticable to transmit the scene as a whole, consequently the methods used in newspaper printing, whereby the scene is divided up into a very large number of small “dots”, have been adopted. In television these are termed ' elements ”, and the process used to divide the scene into these elements is termed “ scanning ”. If the elements are small enough each can be regarded as of uniform brightness over its whole area, and can thus be transmitted electrically as a single impulse. The number of elements into which the field of view can be divided, or their smallness in relation to the whole image, determines the “ definition ” of the transmission. Since one element is the “unit” from which the received image will be built up, we 126A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 127 cannot see any object distinctly if it was originally smaller than an element. There is nothing imperfect or unnatural in the idea of dividing a scene into elements, for even the finest printing or photograph shows a granular structure when highly magnified, due to the grain of the paper or of the photographic emulsion. The retina of the eye is built up of numerous small cells, and it is true to say that all vision is fundamentally built up from minute elements in this manner. Attempts to transmit all the elements electrically at the same time over a single communication channel have proved unsuccessful, and would seem impossible unless a separate channel is used for each element ! The alternative is to transmit them successively over a single channel, when the process of analysis becomes sequential scanning ”. Modern television operates on this principle, which is the only one that has proved workable in practice, and which incidentally is also responsible for most of the special problems which arise. n-^) ELEMENTS ' - 401 403 400 402 405 404 Fig. 1. A typical television image showing how it is analysed into elements and lines by sequential scanning. The shaded area is that already scanned when the aperture has reached the position “A.” Considering sequential scanning in more detail;— if the many elements are to be dealt with in succession, they must be taken in some definite sequence, for clearly if the scene is to be correctly reproduced, the receiver must at any instant be reproducing the element which corresponds in position to the one undergoing transmission at that instant. Hence not only must the number, size, shape and position of all elements be identical at both transmitter and receiver, but they must be dealt with in the same order and at the same rate in both cases. This is another way of saying that the scanning process must be strictly synchro nous, which means that the scanning of all receivers must be adjusted to correspond exactly with that of the transmitter from which they are wcrl'ing; and naturally, since the scanning processes must be synchronised, the equipment used to effect scanning must also work sjnchronously. There is an almost unlimited choice of sequences in which the elements might he taken, and several have been used or advocated for one reason or another. In practice, however, the simplest seems the most suitable, this being the one known as ' plain sequential scanning ” illustrated dia- grammatically in Fig. 1. Here the elements are considered to be arranged in uniform rows or “ lines ” across the image field, and are scanned along each row in turn with uniform speed. It is proposed to make a few simplifications of the strict theory for the present explanation, and to regard each element as a minute square, when the width of each scanning “ line ” will be equal to that of an element. If the image field of view is square as shown in the illustration and is divided into N lines, then there will be a total of N 2 elements to be transmitted. If the field is not square, but has a ratio of breadth to height of b to a, then the number of elements b becomes - N 2 . a In practice the shape of a cinema screen is a convenient one to use, when the factor b/a becomes 5/4, and will not modify the total number of elements very drastically. It is usual to specify television definition by stating the number of scanning lines N, and to assume tacitly that the image is not far removed from the square shape, that the elements approximate to squares, and that they are equally spaced in both dimensions. The definition will then be the same along the scanning lines as it is across them, a condition which is by no means essential, but has been found the most satisfactory compromise when the total definition is not quite as great as might be desired. There remains the choice between a vertical and horizontal direction of scan, which is not found of primary importance, but since the equipment is somewhat simplified and the number of lines kept down if the image be scanned along its longer dimension, the present cinema-shaped field is scanned horizontally. Consider now that the scene has been scanned in this manner and the light collected from successive elements applied to a photo-cell to set up pro portional electrical potential. This potential will fluctuate with time as the successive elements of differing brightness are scanned, and it will therefore possess a wave-form of some kind. This could be analysed into a series of sine-waves by the Fourier theorems, and is capable of providing the modulation for a radio transmitter. Thus from the amateur’s point of view television may be regarded as a new form of modulation, which can be applied to his transmitter, if this is suitable in the several respects mentioned later. As a guide to practical methods we must consider the form of modulation that the television signals will comprise. Unlike telephony modulation, which is very similar in characteristics irrespective of the transmitter used, television modulation differs fundamentally according to the number of elements and the rate at which scanning is carried out, or speaking more broadly with the “ definition standards ” adopted. The rate of scanning is determined by two factors; first the fact that the motion o': be scanning process must be sufficiently rapid to appear continuous to the eye, and second, the whole field must be scanned a sufficient number of times every second to give the impression of continuous movement in the final image, thus preventing excessive flicker from being noticed by viewers. In this respect advantage is taken of persistence of vision,! .e., the fact that the visual impression of an object seen remains on the retina128 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO for a fraction of a second after it has actually ceased. As in the cinema this allows a succession of still scenes to appear as continuous vision. In television, however, this convenient defect of the eye is even more important, for at any instant there is not even a still image, but merely a single element moving with an extremely high velocity. The number of complete scannings per second which is necessary to give these effects is dependent upon the actual brightness of the picture. About ten per second will reproduce movement effectively, but some twenty-five are required to eliminate flicker when a receiver image is rather dim, and at least fifty when it is brilliant. The rate at which these scannings follow each other is referred to as the “ frame frequency”. Frequencies Involved in Television Transmission When considering the mechanism of scanning it will be seen that the elements are not trans mitted one after the other along the lines in a series of jumps, but it is in fact an “ exploring aperture ” of the size and shape of an element which moves along the line, picking up the changing values of illumination over which it passes. In early equipment an actual hole in a rotating disc or shutter effected this exploration, whilst in later systems complex optical devices of lenses, mirrors or prisms swept a narrow beam of light along the lines or picked out the successive small areas. To-day electrical methods are used, a cathode ray being the exploring beam, swept along the successive lines by deflecting fields. Whatever form the “ exploring aperture ” may take in practice, its action can only be strictly examined by methods using integral calculus, because its motion along each line is continuous. Such analysis shows that if changes of light (or electrical potentials) of infinite rapidity could be transmitted, it would be possible to see objects decidedly smaller than the scanning aperture itself. This increased definition would only occur along the line, however, and not in the perpendicular direction ; whilst to transmit infinitely high frequencies would involve infinite sideband width, which is clearly impossible. No serious error will be made in practice if it is assumed that the time taken to scan one element is the shortest period that need be considered, and that the single pulse of potential each produces is the smallest electrical unit involved. On this basis it can be said that as the scanning aperture passes over each element an electrical pulse is produced, which will be similar to a sinusoidal half-wave in form, and of amplitude proportional to the illu mination of that particular element. Since the elements follow at uniform rate, these half-wave pulses will combine to produce a high-frequency modulation, of frequency one-half that at which the elements follow each other. Detailed calcula tions by experts differ as to what this frequency should be, giving its values from that stated above up to twice that figure. This value is termed “ f (max) ” and represents the highest frequency which need be transmitted by a television system to provide uniform definition in all directions across the field of view. Let us estimate /(max) for practical cases. If there are N scanning lines across a square field, there will be N 2 elements, and if the frame frequency be F, then the number of elements scanned per second will be N 2 F. Hence /(max) on the basis taken will be N 2 F/2 ; and will certainly not need to exceed N 2 F. This is the highest frequency therefore which the communication channel used for television must handle without serious loss, and as will be seen later may be several Me ! Taking arbitary figures, it is considered tha,t 10,000 elements represents a good moderate definition, and that a frame frequency of 25 is about the minimum possible. The maximum modulation frequency is therefore 10,000x25 ^ 2 = 125,000 cycles/second. This is the order of that used in many foreign systems during past years, and would suffice for certain amateur experiments. The original Baird 30-line low definition system produced a maximum frequency of about 13,000 cycles, which is just within the limit possible as modulation for a medium-wave broadcast transmitter such as the London National at local range. It could therefore be transmitted from that station successfully. The definition, however, was far too low for general entertainment or film transmission, although it was sufficient for fair reproduction of a single close-up. The new B.B.C. service from the Alexandra Palace has increased definition con siderably, and is now able to handle quite complex scenes with adequate detail. With the 405 lines used in these transmissions the /(max) is about 2 million cycles. Such a high frequency cannot possibly be used to modulate a transmitter in the medium or moderately short wave regions, where the carrier frequency would be of the same order, hence there is no option but to employ an ultra-short wavelength carrier. Any frequency above about 20 Me would be suitable ; but the difficulty of fitting in a carrier modulated to a total bandwidth of 4 Me between existing services, and the necessity of avoiding all types of fading, which affect television more seriously than they do telephony, has led to the use of carrier frequencies around 40 Me, i.e. 7 metres wavelength. Summing up the requirements of a television transmission channel, whether radio or cable, it will be seen that it must be able to handle without serious loss the maximum frequency involved, which may reach several Me. This implies either a short wavelength, or special cable of very low internal capacity and losses, It must also be able to handle all lower frequencies down at to least the frame frequency, and for the best reproduction down to zero frequency; namely, a direct current. Moreover, it must do this without marked phase changes, truly a formidable task ! Change of phase will affect the relative positions of portions of a television image, causing distortion or shadow effects. This is most marked in the lower frequencies which correspond to larger dark or light areas of the scene, and it may even be better to omit these rather than to have them present with serious phase displacement. These considerations of complete phase and frequency linearity determine the design of television circuits and their chief differences from the more usual forms used in telephony. Their influence is particularly important in amplifier design, where many circuit devices commonly met in L.F. practice, such as transformer coupling, are entirely unsuited to television work. The disposition of energy at other frequencies should also be noted. The television modulation contains energy at all frequencies from /(max) down to the ” line frequency ”, namely, that at which the scanning lines follow each other, and this is irregularly distributed according to the nature of the scene. Since many features will repeat themselves for V •se\ coi sin be] is wh at noi at tiv anc mu list no1 def •ch£ bui eye stn fre&lt; eas •at -anc hea int( Tra p be i trai cat! .are offe T an emi arm nec&lt; hop to g fror sele mis; ban whe mig tarn mile thes inte Thar quit be p with tran this Ir to 1 the asso fadi: Tece; imp&lt; whil very The capa diffi&lt; sing] AY it!A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO -several successive lines, there is a very strong component at the line frequency, often the largest single frequency to be detected. No energy is believed to occur below this until the frame frequency is reached, which is also comparatively intense, whilst a progressively diminishing amplitude exists at lower frequencies down to zero cycles. It will be noticed that two chief concentrations of energy occur, at the line frequency and frame frequency respec tively. At all others energy is as a rule much less, and is changing continously with the changing image, much of it being in the form of transients. Thus, on listening to a television signal two steady musical notes will be heard, within the audible scale if the definition be low, but in some cases above it. The •characteristic tone of the Baird 30-line signals was built up mainly of a line frequency of 750 cycles per second, and a frame frequency pulsation at 12-5 cycles. I he present B.B.C. transmissions show a strong frame frequency at 50 cycles, but the line frequency is at 10,125 cycles and therefore not so easily heard. Much of the remaining signal energy is .at still higher fiequencies, largely above audibility, -and so the volume of sound heard in ordinary headphones gives a very imperfect guide to the actual intensity of vision signals. Transmission A very good introduction to television methods can be reached through the study of the simpler types of transmission. Whilst these are giving place to cathode ray systems in the broadcast studio, they -are of fundamental technical interest; further, they offer a field for amateur experiment. The normal transmitting licence does not permit an amateur to transmit vision signals. Such emissions are in any case barred from the usual amateur wavebands, in which the wide sidebands necessary for even low definition vision would cause hopeless confusion ; but the Post Office is prepared to grant the use of an additional frequency band of from 30 to 32 Me for vision experiments in ■selected cases. Only one high definition radio trans mission could be accommodated at a time within this band and within range of the transmitter. At times when the ground wave only is being received, it might be possible to operate transmitters simul taneously in localities separated by some 20 to 50 miles or more, but on the frequent occasions when these frequencies are open for DX we should expect interference from distant vision transmitters if more than a very few operated at one time. Even with •quite low definition vision modulation, it would only be possible to accommodate about a dozen stations within the band, and so the scope for amateur transmission of vision by radio seems very limited on Ihis account. In any case vision reception seems to be confined to the ground wave range of the transmitter; the phase, amplitude, and other types of distortion associated with reflected wave working and with fading effects being usually sufficient to spoil reception at great distances. Vision DX is probably impossible except perhaps at very low definitions, whilst no case of good high definition reception at very considerable distances has yet been reported. The type of equipment now to be outlined is capable of handling up to flO-line definition without difficulty, at which it is possible to reproduce a single head and shoulders “ close up ” excellently. With skilful design and ample light its use can be extended to over 100 lines, the limit depending to a large extent upon the efficiency with which each part is constructed and used. Television is less simple than most branches of radio communication, and experience with simple gear is almost essential before anything approaching high definition trans mission over a radio link is likely to prove successful. Moreover, the greatly increased risk of interference to others makes it most important that the amateur working in this new field should be quite clear about what he is doing. Fig. 2. Arrangement of the essential parts of an optical television transmitter. Tig. 2 illustrates the essentials of a vision trans mitter ; and until the recent introduction of electronic transmission, all systems worked very much on these lines. Such systems are still used in some types of high definition film transmission and are suited to amateur use. S represents the scene to be transmitted, which if not in strong daylight must be illuminated by powerful flood'- lights. Illumination reflected from the scene is picked up by the lens L to form a real image in the plane of the scanning device, at I. This process is exactly similar to that used in photography, and L may well be a photographic objective of large aperture. The image thus formed is now scanned, being divided up into lines and elements as explained in the previous section. It is mainly in the form of scanning devices used that transmitters differ, and this will be alluded to later. After scanning, the light corresponding to one element only is allowed to fall upon the130 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO photocell P, which sets up a potential corresponding to the instantaneous value of illumination of the element being picked out by the scanner at that instant. This potential will vary continuously as the scanning takes place, and this variation after adequate amplification provides the vision signal, which can be transmitted over cable or applied to modulate a radio transmitter. Transmission in this manner is termed “ Flood lit ” or “ Direct Pick-up ” television. Its chief limitation lies in the difficulty of obtaining adequate illumination, which has always been the major obstacle to television progress. Scanning devices are inherently wasteful and optically inefficient, whilst even if all such losses could be overcome, there is a fundamental loss of light involved in the process of scanning. At any instant the illumination reflected by only one element of the scene reaches the photocell. Thus, for example, a 100-line scanning involving 10,000 elements would imply that a total not exceeding 01 per cent, of the total illumination of the scene could reach the cell. In practice the proportion would be much less, perhaps only 0001 per cent., since the lens L can pick up only a small fraction of the total illumina tion, whilst there are many incidental losses in even the best scanning arrangements. It will be noticed that this loss of light must increase very rapidly as the definition is raised, being at least proportional to the square of the number of lines used. This is the basic reason why optical-mechanical television methods become difficult to apply to high definitions, and why they cannot be used above about 100 lines unless certain recent, rather involved, optical processes are resorted to. J. L. Baird introduced a second type of trans mission designed to reduce this difficulty, often termed the “ Flying spot ” system. In this method the position of the light source and photo cell shown in Fig. 2 are interchanged, an arc lamp being placed at the point P, whilst the floodlights shown are replaced by several photocells all connected to the main vision amplifier. The process of transmission is virtually the same, but the path of the rays is now reversed. An intense beam of light from the arc lamp will now be projected through the scanner and the lens L, to fall on the scene and illuminate one element of this at any instant. Thus instead of scanning an image of the scene, we can scan the scene itself by a beam of light which covers the area of a single element only at any instant. The remainder of the scene must be in relative darkness, although a little constant illu mination will not matter because only changes in illumination will produce an alternating potential in the vision amplifier. Steady illumination will correspond to a direct current from the cells, which would probably be too difficult for an amateur to transmit as part of the vision signal. The advantage of inverting the process in this way lies in the fact that a higher intensity of scanning beam can be obtained from the arc lamp than could be tolerated from flood lighting. This intense beam is moving so fast that it gives the impression of feeble illumination and is not objec tionable to the person televised. In other words, although the particular element being dealt with is very strongly illuminated, the average illumina tion is small. This is clearly more efficient than to flood the whole scene with intense light, which, besides being expensive and dazzling to the artists. may also be accompanied by a very objectionable amount of heat. Spotlight scanning is, however, only suited to small studio scenes, and was the ^ method employed in the original 30-line B B C. service. For many subjects including outdoor scenes it will be inconvenient or impossible. Direct illumination of the scene is also desirable on the same principle as that shown in Fig. 2, when the subject is a photograph, or a transparency such as a cine- matograph film. In this case ample illumination is possible and optical scanning methods have given some of the best results yet obtained. It will be noticed that beyond explaining the process of scanning little has been said about the methods employed to achieve it. Numerous methods have been evolved, but except for a few which are still being actively developed by such firms as Scophony and Mihaly-Traub, they are now’ obsolete. The earliest and certainly the simplest of practical television scanning devices was the Nipkow Disc, which has been so widely described that it will be familiar to most readers. It consists simply of an opaque disc, usually of aluminium, pierced with a number of holes equal to the number of scanning lines to be used. These lie on a spiral track about the axis of rotation, and are equally spaced along it, so that the angles subtended by the radii on which any two successive holes lie will be equal at the centre of the disc. Thus this angle will be 360/N degrees for an N line disc, and the spacing between the holes would be 1/N(27r»') if they all lay upon a circle of radius r. Actually this is not quite the case, since the holes lie on a spiral, and the radial distance of the first and last hole from the centre will differ by a small amount. For a horizontally scanned image with a breadth to height ratio of b/a, this radial distance will equal a/b times the mean circumferential spacing. Thus the area between the two extreme holes will be approximately a rectangle (having slightly curved sides, which can be neglected) of the shape ratio a to b, and will represent the image frame. As the disc is rotated, the several holes pass successively across this frame, scanning it in a series of lines. If w’e imagine such a disc at the position shown in Fig. 2, with the image of a scene pro jected upon it so as just to fill the area sw'ept over by the spiral of holes, then these will analyse the image into a series of parallel (very slightly curved) strips. At any instant, only one hole will be allowing light to pass, and this becomes the scanning aperture, picking out one element of the scene for transmission. Hence, just as the number of holes determines the number of scanning lines, so their shape determines that of the element. Similarly their size relative to that of the image determines the size of the element. Since the whole frame is scanned once for each rotation of the disc, the latter must rotate at the rate at which successive images are -wanted, say twenty-five times per second, i.e., 1,500 r.p.m. It is important that each hole should accurately fill the width of each scanning strip, so that lines of demarcation will not be too noticeable between them. The television image should always be viewed at the optimum distance, at which the eye cannot quite resolve individual lines. The image w r ill then seem quite continuous. This is practicable where definition is high, the lines being numerous and relatively narrow, but is seldom employed at lower definitions as the imageA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO would appear too small from that distance. To minimise line effect the holes may be made round so that the strips overlap slightly, or hexagonal as in certain German discs. If rectangular they need to be made very accurately. A satisfactory medium definition transmitter using the disc could be built on these lines by the amateur. Definitions above 100 lines should not be attempted, as sufficient illumination is impossible unless more advanced scanning methods are used, or transmission confined to film only. In any case experience at lower definitions is desirable at first, 30 lines being a suitable starting-point for which a disc can be obtained, whilst 50 or 60 lines is a very good medium standard. If the floodlight system be used, a very minimum of 300 watts of illumination is essential and even more desirable for good results. Too much illumination can hardly be used, provided the subjects can be made to put up with the heat ! Still pictures such as photographs or postcards can be dealt with at a lower illumina tion. The “ flying spot ” system will be found easier to use and more economical, a small auto matic feed arc lamp running at from 10 to 15 amps, being ideal to flood the back of the disc through a condensing lens as shown. Metal filament or exciter lamps are of little use here for the scanning of living subjects, as their intrinsic brilliance is too low, but they can be used for small photographs, or “ stills”. The lens L should be of the largest aperture obtainable, not less than F/4, and of magnification sufficient to cover the desired scene. A lantern projection combination might be used. The disc can best be run directly upon the spindle of a synchronous motor ; speeds between 750 and 3,000 r.p.m. being possible and 1,500 r.p.m. a good compromise. If a receiving disc is used it should be run from the same mains, thus achieving synchronisation. Means should be provided for rotating one of the motor frames in order to get the two into phase, i.e., to obtain correct ” framing.” If a cathode ray receiver is used it could be syn chronised from the mains or from the image signal as will be explained later. Other well known scanning systems such as the mirror drum, lens disc, or mirror screw are equally applicable, and the interested amateur can learn about the necessary optical modifications from several of the textbooks listed on page 151. Photo-cells Photocells used in television should be of high sensitivity and of the caesium on silver oxide type. Sodium or potassium cells have too low a sensitivity and are not suitable. Photocells fall into two classes, the ” gasfilled ” type in which traces of inert gas contribute to the ionisation current and increase the output, and the vacuum type in which only true photo-emission is made use ■of. The latter type are almost free from frequency limitations, and are essential for high definition work ; but the gas-filled variety can be employed with fair success at definitions below about 60 lines. They possess, however, a slight time lag •owing to the ionisation of the gas filling not being quite instantaneous, and this reduces their output above about 100,000 cycles, thus blurring the finer detail of the images. Caesium cells are sensitive to the red end of the spectrum, as well as much of the blue-violet, which makes them effective with incandescent filament lighting; further, they improve the light sensitivity much as do panchromatic films in photography. They have made possible the effect which has been termed “ Noctovision ” by J. L. Baird, in which the scene is scanned by infra red light invisible to the eye. A scene is thus televised when in apparent darkness. The small potentials produced by photocells must be amplified before they can modulate a carrier wave or operate a receiver. This problem is a more difficult one than the amplification of sound, and its solution has called for considerable research. The vision signals involve a range of frequencies from at least 25 cycles and preferably much lower, up to a maximum of 100,000 to 500,000 cycles in medium definition work, or as much as 2 Me in high definition. This range must be evenly amplified, and what is more, there must be little phase change of the upper and lower freq uencies particularly the latter. This is of little importance in sound amplification, but in vision the phase of an impulse determines the time at which it reaches the receiver relative to components of other frequencies, and since the scanning process will be progressing at unvarying speed, a phase delay will change the position of objects and seriously distort the image. Exactly similar requirements apply to vision frequency amplification at the receiver, and for this reason it is kept to a minimum, radio frequency amplification being used whenever possible in its place. In transmission it is, however, essential to amplify the photocell signals. A pre-amplifier is usually- placed directly adjacent to the cell or cells, keeping the connecting lead very short. The pre-amplifier and cell may be housed in one box and heavily screened. Every precaution will be necessary to prevent noise pickup, for the output from the cells will be very small. Live interstage leads must be of the lowest possible capacity to earth, since good definition demands that the highest fre quencies be retained. The amplifier may be of one or two stages, and can be direct-coupled with advantage. It is advisable for the best imao'e quality to retain the direct photocell current, which corresponds to the average image brightness! This helps to distinguish between a dark scene and a brightly lit one, which would be reproduced with the same average brightness without it. The main transmitting amplifier is best made resistance-capacity coupled, carefully designed to retain both the extreme high and low frequencies with minimum phase change. The valves used should be of the high mutual conductance type, having at the same time relatively low impedance and inter-electrode capacities. The anode resistance should be kept down to a few thousand ohms in order to minimise the bypassing effect of stray capacities which form a low parallel reactance at high frequencies. A small air-cored choke should be placed in series with these resistances, as the added inductance imparts a reactance to the circuit which rises with frequency, and if suitably calculated to match the valves it will provide a level ampli fication up to very high frequencies. The main tenance of the extreme low frequencies is more difficult, but fortunately it is not absolutely essential for moderately good image quality. It can be approached at considerable cost by the use of very large bypass and coupling condensers, but it has been shown in recent research that careful choice of the values of anode bypass and decouplingA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO condensers and resistances can introduce a com pensating action which levels out the response yerj effectively. It still remains difficult to stabilise a high gain amplifier when the response near to zero frequency is good, and very stable and good H.T. and bias regulation is essential. Paraphase con struction is used as one method of overcoming this instability, whilst in others the amplifier is designed to cut off at near the frame frequency, and a separate channel used to amplify the lower fre quencies. It is impossible to give circuit values here, particularly as television, unlike telephony, differs widely according to the definition standards and type of equipment used. The amateur interested 5 in transmitting experiments will find that an R.C. coupled amplifier built and screened as carefully as possible on the foregoing lines provides a good starting point. From five to eight stages are likely to be required, according to the illumination reaching the photocells, the limit being set by valve noise and Thompson effect. Battery opera tion of the cell pre-amplifier is likely to be necessary. Electronic Transmission The almost insuperable difficulties encountered in mechanical scanning at high definition have led to the use of electrical methods, based on the cathode ray tube, which we shall study shortly. Fig. 3 shows the principle of one of the most successful of these, which has been developed by Zworykin in America and by the Marconi-E.M.I. Television Co. in this country.* Here the illu- « minated scene is picked up by a lens L as before, and a real image formed on the surface of an elec trode which in itself forms the photo-sensitive caesium cathode of a photocell. This electrode is the heart of the system, being composed of a fine granular structure of caesium globules, deposited by a chemical process, which individually insulates, them, upon a mica plate, the back of which is metallised. Each caesium globule thus forms a minute photocell, having an electrical capacity to the metal coating behind it, the mica forming a dielectric. The image formed upon this special surface is scanned in the manner to be explained shortly, by a cathode ray beam, which is in fact a stream of electrons. . The whole is enclosed in the evacuated glass envelope of a cathode ray tube, and can be enclosed in a cameralike case, resembling a cinematograph camera. The image formed by the lens L falls upon the caesium surface continuously, and each globule will produce a small photoelectric current propor tional to the light falling upon it. This will in turn charge up the small condenser which the globule forms, at a rate depending upon the illumination of that portion of the scene. As the scanning beam passes ov r each group of globules (the area of the beam representing the scanning element is much larger than a single globule) it picks up the charge which has accumulated upon them during the scanning interval and transfers it to the external amplifier input circuit. The beam thus merely serves as an inertialess electrical commutatoi oi collector. This system is enormously more sensitive than the older mechanical ones, besides being more convenient. The reason for this lies in the fact that all the light collected by the lens, and not merely that light corresponding to a single element, is producing photo-electric current all the time. The cathode ray collects most of this energy as it scans the caesium surface, and thus a very large proportion of the light available is effectively used. There is. no loss inherent in the scanning process, but only that due to practical or constructional imperfec tions. The system can transmit good images from scenes in ordinary daylight, and is claimed to work up to 800-line definition or more, were it possible to transmit the resulting enormous frequency band by radio. The Marconi-E.M.I. system Emitron cameras 3 which are installed at the Alexandra Palace, employ this type of scanning. The standard of high definition which has been adopted after comparative tests is 405 lines. An interesting idea of the layout and components which make up a modern installa tion will be given by Fig. 8, to which we refer later. The sideband width found necessary to accommodate this definition satisfactorily is the order of 2 Me per sideband, and an ultra-high frequency carrier of 45 Me has been adopted to transmit this. To reduce the effect of flicker in the reception of bright images the expedient of “ interlacing ” has been adopted. This enables the scene to be illuminated 50 times per second, whilst only trans mitting 25 complete image frames, thus keeping down the maximum frequency required. Ihis principle is illustrated in the lower portion of big. 1- T4- r &gt; r\r-»oio4-c c*r\r q‘ t'P llTlf* 'fTOTTl * It is generally recognised that the original conception of this device can be accredited to the late A. A. Campbell- Swinton,, ijsq., one-time President of the R.S.G.13.—[Ed.].A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 133 1st to the 405th, thus coverirg half the total lines in l/50th second, and evenly illuminating the screen. The process is then repeated scanning the remaining lines from the 2nd, 4th and 6th, etc., up to the 404th. In each case the scanning process finishes at a half-line, which automatically pro vides the necessary displacement of the two inter laced rasters, or scanning traces, when the receiver is of the cathode ray type. The final result is equivalent to 25-frame scanning, but with a flicker frequency raised to 50 per second. This reduces the visible flicker almost to zero. Another method of transmission must be men tioned. This is the “ intermediate film ” system. A film is taken of the desired subject at the time of transmission, developed in a few seconds, and immediately transmitted while still wet by optical means. Sufficient light can be passed safely through a moving film to allow of high definition scanning, even by disc methods. The film can be dried for storage, or the emulsion cleaned off and recoated for use over again. This method may seem somewhat cumbersome and costly, but it is one which has been used with fair success. Television Reception In the earlier days reception always took the form of a reversal of the transmitting process, essentially that of Fig. 2. In place of the photocell was placed a light source capable of varying in intensity to correspond to the incoming signal amplitude, the neon lamp being the best known and probably the first used with success. Alterna tively a source of constant brightness such as an arc or filament lamp was used, and the light modu lated to correspond to the signals by a “ light valve ” such as the Kerr cell. The beam then passed through a scanning device, identical with or equivalent to thatatthe transmitter, and synchronous therewith. It was then projected by a lens on to a screen either reflecting or translu cent, and viewed much as would be a cinema image. Such methods are quite practicable at low definition, but possess the same defects as mechanical transmitters, the most serious of which is poor or even useless illumination of the screen as the number of lines is increased. They have therefore been largely abandoned for home use in favour of the more effective cathode ray methods. Cathode Ray Reception In the cathode ray tube we have a means of tracing upon a fluorescent screen a luminous curve connecting two variable quantities, and it was originally developed exclusively for such work. The tube has more recently been found very effective in television reception. Fig. 4 shows the constructional features of a modern receiving tube. In some respects it resembles a valve, consisting of a highly evacuated glass envelope, fitted with a cathode at the neck. This is generally of the indirectly heated construction, suitable for use on A.C. This cathode produces the usual emission of electrons, and these are to some extent concentrated and prevented from straying in all directions by the negative or Wenhelt cylinder. A stream of electrons passes out through a hole in the closed end of this cylinder, and the most usual method for modulating the intensity of this stream is to apply vision signals to the negative cylinder, varying its potential with respect to the cathode. In other tubes an auxiliary modu lating electrode, or grid, is inserted at a later point along the electron stream. Following the cylinder is the first anode, which is held at a fairly high positive potential and accelerates the electron stream into a high velocity beam. The beam, moving rapidly along the tube, strikes the fluorescent coating which covers the inside of the end of the tube, where it produces a glow proportional to the beam intensity or “ beam current.” Unless certain precautions are taken the beam will disperse during its journey along the Fig. 4. The electrode as sembly of a typical cathode ray tube, as used in tele vision reception.134 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO tube, producing a diffuse spot upon the screen. To overcome this it must be focused in order to arrive there as a small sharp spot, which is now the scanning element that builds up the received image. In earlier tubes, used at relatively low beam speeds, traces of gas were introduced to produce “gas focusing’’. This gas was ionised by the passage of the beam, and the positivelv charged ions produced fo.'med a “core'' which attracted the electrons composing the beam towaids its own axis, thus checking dispersion and keeping the beam narrow. This effect tends to break down when the beam oscillates at high frequencies, and focusing becomes poor, with a result that such tubes are not favoured for television. In the modern “ hard ” or highly evacuated tube the beam is “ electron-focused ” by the aid of electrostatic or magnetic fields. In the former case a second and perhaps third anode is introduced at still higher positive potentials. These set up fields which act upon the beam very much as lenses do on a beam of light, and by adjustment of potentials and suitable anode design a sharp and small spot is produced on the screen, and will be maintained even at the highest frequencies likely to be used. There is a limit to the minimum spot size possible, and therefore to the width of scanning line it can trace, which means that too small a screen cannot be used if a large number of lines is to be accommodated. This is one of the difficulties in projecting an image from a small bright tube, on which a sufficient number of distinct lines cannot be accommodated with the smallest spot at present obtainable. Cathode ray screens vary from 1 inch up to some 6 inches in diameter Fig. 5. Schematic diagram of the parts which are needed to make up a complete television receiver. for measurement work, and from S inches through an average size of 12 or 14 inches up to about 24 inches for television work. Having obtained a sharp spot, it is necessary to sweep the beam in parallel lines across the screen to produce scanning. This can be done because the beam of electrons behaves like an almost inertialess wire carrying current, and will be deflected sideways by either an electric or magnetic field. In electro statically deflected tubes the beam passes between two pairs of “deflector plates in mutually per pendicular planes as illustrated. To one pair of these is applied a suitable potential at the line frequency, whilst to the others is applied the frame frequency, serving to displace the lines into a raster, and to return the spot back to its original position after the screen has been completely scanned. A similar effect can be produced by two perpendicular coils carrying oscillatory current, when the magnetic fields deflect the beam in precisely the same manner. One electric and one magnetic deflector are sometimes used in the two planes respectively as a matter of commercial convenience. In cathode ray reception therefore the image is built up upon the fluorescent screen of the tube by the beam, which acts as a scanning device. Ihe brightness of any element is determined by the beam intensity, modulated electrically by the vision signal, while the beam area (size of spot) determines the size of scanning element. A potential variation of 10 volts is sufficient to modulate a modern tube from black to full brilliance, so very little signal energy is needed. The system owes its efficiency to the fact that the screen illu mination follows quite different laws to those of a beam of light. The energy of illumination comes from the beam, being provided by the anode current of the tube, and is independent of the speed with which the beam moves. The average illumina tion thus tends to be independent of the number of lines, and is maintained up to very high standards of definition. The Receiver Fig. 5 shows schematically the parts which make up a complete receiver for radio vision signals. Two radio receivers are necessary, for sound and vision respectively. It is assumed that each of these contains its own power supply. The sound receiver feeds a speaker placed near to the vision screen, whilst the vision receiver provides two outputs. One of these feeds the modulating grid of the C.R. tube. To avoid distortion and to retain the D.C. component of the rectified signal, it is best to provide this directly from the diode detector (or second detector if a superheterodyne is used) which works at “ high level’’, delivering a swing of ten or more volts. Alternatively, a single amplifying stage may be used following a diode working at a lower level. Some means must clearly be provided for syn chronising the scanning process in the receiver with that of the transmitter, and this is done by the vision signals themselves. On studying Fig. 8, which shows the layout of the television trans mitter, it will be noticed that synchronising pulse generators are showm. These are superimposed upon the vision modulation, to produce a carrier waveform of the type shown in Fig. 6. At theA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 135 beginning of each scanning line the generator inserts an impulse of square waveform, which is used to reduce the carrier to zero. Modulation is similarly supressed for a longer period at the completion of each frame. Now it has been decided to limit the vision signal to the range of from 100 per cent, modulation for the high lights to 30 per cent, modulation for black. Zero carrier thus corre sponds to “blacker than black”, which cannot at the moment determined by the synchronising impulse. Fig. 7 shows the typical type of circuit, which apart from its use in television is commonly required when using a C.R. tube for any measure ment purposes. The condenser C is charged up from the H.T. supply. For the potential across this condenser to rise linearly with time the charging current must be constant, which can be achieved if the charging takes place through a high adjustable SIGNALS AT END OF EVEN FRAMES PEAK CARRIER SIGNALS AT ENO OF ODD FRAMES WHITE IOO% BLACH SYNC Fig. 6. The waveform of a television signal as transmitted by the E.M.I. system. further darken the screen, but owing to the amplitude of these synchronising impulses being lower than that of any portion of the vision modulation, they can be separated therefrom by an amplitude filter. The second line from the vision receiver output therefore goes to such a filter unit as shown. This may consist of a saturated pentode valve, so biased that any increase of modulation above 30 per cent, cannot further increase its anode current, thus pre venting any vision signals reaching the anode circuit. A carrier below 30 per cent., however, reduces anode current below the saturation value, producing in the anode circuit sharp impulses at the line frequency, which can be used to synchronise the deflecting oscil lators, or“ time base generators ” as they are termed. These units complete the equipment, together with an eliminator unit to supply them wdth ITT. voltage, which may be included in the time base chassis, and a second eliminator which supplies the anode and bias voltages of the cathode ray tube. These may be as high as 3,000 volts, but very little current is needed, and so the cost of this unit need not be high. Smoothing can be effected by a simple high resistance filter and two condensers of not more than 1 p.F each. Constructional particulars of all these units can be found in current periodicals. We must now discuss briefly the time base units. These must piroduce the line or frame frequency, but not in a sinewave form. We wish to sweep the spot across the screen with uniform speed for each line, and then to return it for the next in the shortest possible time. This necessitates a “ saw tooth ” waveform, having a strictly linear rising portion followed by a steep and brief return as shown in Fig. 9 ; and in the simplest methods is produced by the charging up of a condenser at constant current, followed by its sudden discharge resistance as shown. The process is actually expotential rather than linear, but if the H.f. be high relative to the maximum potential built up across C, then the result will be sufficiently linear for most purposes. It is for this reason that the H.T. should be at least ten times the peak potential across C, 1,000 volts being desirable. By suitable selection of C and adjustment of R, the time period of charge can be adjusted to any desired value. C may be of the order of -1 p.F to -5 p.F for frame frequencies, and about -GOOSuF for 405-line scanning The simplest method of discharge is provided by a thyratron, VT, or gas-filled triode, containing mercury vapour for low speed work or a gas such136 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO as argon or helium for higher speeds. Such a tube passes no current until the anode potential reaches a critical value determined by the grid bias, when the anode resistance drops suddenly to a low value. A thyratron connected across C as shown will thus discharge it every time the potential reaches a certain value, determined by the grid bias which should be provided by a battery or separate stable eliminator, and thus provide the necessary sudden return to zero which the sawtooth waveform demands. above the cathode. It is therefore necessary to provide an amplifier of the sawtooth waveform, which should preferably apply it in opposite phase to the two plates. To the right of the dotted line in Fig. 7 is shown the simplest method of achieving this. . The amplifying valve is provided with equal load resistances in anode and cathode circuit. It is directly coupled to the oscillator to preserve the waveform, and the potentials built up across the two resistances v r ill be in phase opposition. These are Fig. 8. Schematic diagram of the E.M.I. transmitter in use at the Alexandra Palace. If C, R, and the bias be set to give an oscillation period slightly longer than the desired line frequency, .and the synchronising impulses be applied to the thyratron grid, they will momentarily depress the bias potential. Since this was only slightly .above that for discharge, the exact instant will be determined by the impulse, and the condenser ■C discharges and commences to provide a fresh scanning sweep at the correct instant. A pair of deflector plates can be connected directly across C, with the addition of preset potentiometers to adjust the standing bias so that The beam scans an area centred correctly in the tube. These are the “ framing controls”. There are many other types of time base oscillator, some •of which use hard valves only in special types of •oscillatory circuit, but most do not provide sufficient .amplitude to deflect fully the beam of a large tube, which requires from 100 to 1000 volts. Also certain .distortions of the raster are avoided if the deflector plates be worked in push-pull, at an equal potential applied to the deflector plates. This simple arrangement illustrates the principle, but is not usually used for practical reasons, one of which is that a separate insulated H.T. supply is needed for the amplifying valve, and also that the time base generator is raised above earth potential. Radio Receivers Television is now broadcast only on the ultra- short waves, and we will confine our remarks to the London service, in which the vision carrier is at 45 Me and that for sound at 41-5 Me. The sound receiver can follow standard practice, and may be a simple superheterodyne, a straight receiver or even a super-regenerative type preceded by an H.F. stage to reduce radiation. It may be quite independent of the vision receiver, or it may share the H.F. portion of the vision leceiver. In one commercial mcdel both receivers are superhets, employing a common H.F. and fre quency changer section, but two separate I.F.A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 137 channels. In another the sound signals pass through the first two R.F. stages of a straight vision receiver before being taken to a separate simple super heterodyne. Both straight and superheterodyne vision receivers are used. The Marconiphone and H.M.V. receivers are examples of the former, five flatly tuned R.F. stages being used at 45 Me followed by a diode de tector which directly feeds the C.R. tube. The coup ling coils are resonated by the eddy-current method, being fitted with movable brass plungers. The stage gain is necessarily low, as a band width of 4 Me must be amplified without little loss, but the overall amplification is found to be sufficient at any distance from the transmitter at which local background noise permits reception at all. Fig. 9. Typical waveform of sawtooth oscillator output. In most other designs the vision receiver is a superheterodyne, following conventional practice in respect of the frequency changer, which may be a triode-pentode preceded by a single flat R.F. stage. An intermediate frequency between the limits of 5 and 10 Me is chosen, being high enough to pass the necessary bandwidth, and low enough to retain as much stage gain as possible. Single sideband amplification is used in certain designs, with a small gain in efficiency, but the amplification per stage using the most suitable H.F. pentodes cannot exceed about 16, and is generally much less owing to the heavy damping of the couplings by resistance found essential to provide a 2 or 4 Me bandpass characteristic. As a result, 3 I.F. stages seems to be a minimum for local reception, and most receivers intended for use at greater distances make use of 4 or 5 stages. Diode detection is used, the load resistances and shunt capacities being kept very low indeed. It is not usually thought necessary to provide A.V.C., since fading is not expected within the service area of a vision trans mitter, except in exceptional instances. Vision Aerials Owing to the necessity of providing as much signal input relative to local noise and the interference due to passing cars as possible, a special aerial is almost essential for vision reception. The special array used at the transmitter is designed to provide omnidirectional vertically polarised radiation in the horizontal plane. It consists of a ring of 8 vertical halfwave radiators, each centre-fed, and each with a centre-fed reflector behind it. A similar receiving aerial is naturally to be preferred, simplified to a single vertical halfwave as shown in Fig. 10. The length L of this is of the order of 10 feet 5 inches. It will be best proportioned to resonate at a frequency between the vision and sound wavelengths which will give a similar signal amplitude to each, assuming of course that the usual method of feeding both receivers from a common aerial is made use of. When signal strength is poor, a reflector may be added on the side remote from the transmitter, and has been found very well worth while in many cases. It consists of an insulated wire 2 or 3 per cent, longer than the radiator, mounted parallel to it and a quarter- wavelength away. This dimension is not very critical, 5 feet having been found effective. It must be remembered, however, that in the interest of even response over a 2 Me sideband, the aerial Fig. 10. Aerial suitable for television reception. system must not be too selective, and the use of more complex arrays than the simple reflector should not be undertaken without experiment. This suggests a fruitful field for the amateur in determining the system giving best signal strength with a sufficiently wide acceptance band. Matched low impedance lines are generally preferred to couple the aerial to the receiver, both concentric feeder and the 80 ohms parallel or twisted forms being used. The latter is probably the simplest to install, and may be taken directly to the centre of a split halfwave as illustrated. When end feeding is more convenient, the aerial may be terminated by a quarter-wave matching section spaced at 2 inches, bridged at the lower end as in the second sketch. The feeder is now tapped on at the optimum point, which is likely to lie between 4 and 6 inches from the bottom end, and is best determined by experiment with the help of some kind of output meter attached to the receiver. Constructional details of these aerials have been published in the Wireless World of May 28th, 1937. In conclusion it must be emphasised that a very complete description of television practice cannot be provided in the limited space at our disposal, and that the amateur studying this intensely interesting field is strongly advised to supplement these notes by reading a selection of the textbooks listed on page 151.CHAPTER FIFTEEN How to Become a Radio Amateur Morse Code B.R.S. Numbers—Transmitting Licences—Abbreviations Q Code—Signal Codes T HIS chapter has been uTitten especially for the reader who desires to enter fully into the life of a radio amateur. To enable him to appreciate that side of the movement which deals essentially with the transmission and reception of amateur signals, a good knowledge of the morse code is essential. True, pleasure and much valuable information may be gleaned by listening to amateur telephony transmissions, but the telegraphic aspect has an even greater appeal. For example, during contests, morse is used almost exclusively, whilst a very large proportion of amateurs employ this means of communication exclusively. A knowledge of the code is also required before a full transmitting licence can be obtained. Every licensed amateur is compelled by international regulations to pass a morse test because at any time he or she may be called up by a Government or Service telegraphic station. In this chapter we shall not only discuss the morse code and the international signals used by amateurs, but some information will also be given regarding British receiving stations. Learning the Morse Code Memorising the alphabet must be the initial task. Place the morse code in front of you and memorise the letters and figures by uttering to yourself their morse equivalents, until you can buzz, in morse, any letter or figure that comes to mind. This may take a week or so and the golden rule is patience. If you are really keen you can practise all day and every day, because all you need is something to read off, an advertisement hoarding or a newspaper heading, anything will do. What is the idea and the effect of this method of learning ? The idea is to get you into the habit early of impressing the sound equivalents of the various letters and figures on your brain, rather than having to try and remember them as dots and dashes, which always involves the necessity for un scrambling : that is, the letter A to you should be dit-dah,” and not “ dot-dash-what’s-that-A.” The effect of constant practice is finally to get your brain trained to pick out letters and numbers without the unscrambling process being required. I hen you are ready for the receiver. Get on to one of the amateur bands and find a station sending what even to you sounds like a repetition signal— the same thing over and over again. It will probably be either “ Test ” or ” CQ,” incidentally. Hold on to it till you have found out what he is sending. If you have carried out your “ buzz practice ” properly, you will quickly identify a few letters ; if it is a repetition signal you will finally be able to piece it together, and then you get the thrill of your life on finding you have actually decoded and written down your first morse signal ! You have picked an unknown jumble of sounds out of the air and made sense of them ! When this stage is reached, progress becomes faster. As you listen and carry on with your daily ' buzz practice,” you find you can read more easily and comfortably. CQ and Test calls become instantly recognisable by their sound-formation. Note this point. You begin to appreciate the time values which have to be given to letters and numbers to make them readable, which is most important. This brings us back to our original point—that the method of learning suggested here emphatically rejects the commonly accepted idea that the study of morse involves hard labour with buzzer and key, for the reason that the absolute beginner is only retarding his own progress by trying to send before he can read well enough to know how properly transmitted morse should sound. And to know how correctly formed signals sound, it is only necessary to be able to read call-signs. We can imagine a case where our beginner sits down to practise with his friend, using buzzer and key. Neither has the faintest idea of how correct morse is sent and they proceed to develop a sort of code of their own which, while it may be based on the morse alphabet, yet bears no relation in time-values to what they hear on the air. The result is that they are learning and having to unlearn mistakes at the same time, the bother of it being that all this happens subconsciously without either of them being aware of it. The result is the laborious and heart-breaking process which a lot of our readers know so well. By following the method outlined a keen learner with nothing more than the morse alphabet to go by and the simple rule ‘ ‘ one dah is equal in time to three dits ” can teach himself the code without ever touch ing buzzer and key, and we believe that where there is no qualified assistance available, it is the best and quickest way to learn. We are, of course, talking of the case where our beginner is faced with the morse problem alone and unaided, the position in which we know many readers find themselveST The great value of the method is that the only equipment ” required is one’s ability to utter the two sounds '' dit ” and ' dah.” This is what makes practice possible at any time. The ability to read morse, apart from the fact 138A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 139 that it is an essential requirement for a full licence, opens up an entirely new world to the listener, which puts quite a different complexion on Amateur Radio. Before leaving this subject we must briefly mention the instructional method of learning the code. Often an amateur enthusiast may solicit the services of a good telegraphist or possibly a fully licensed amateur, in which case the buzzer method can be used, but from experience we would recommend the employment of a simple valve oscillator arranged as shown in the accompanying circuit. By using this device no audible signals are heard in the room, while a further advantage is the fact that the person being trained receives a similar type of signal in the head phones to that which he will encounter in actual practice. B.R.S. Numbers In order to associate more closely non-transmitting members with the amateur movement, the Radio Society of Great Britain issues to such persons B.R.S. (British Receiving Station) numbers. A B.R.S. number immediately identifies a member with the R.S.G.B. ; furthermore, it permits him to have printed personal QSL cards for the purpose of reporting upon signals transmitted by other amateurs. He may despatch these cards free of charge via the Society’s QSL Bureau, whilst in coming cards intended for him are forwarded, at regular intervals, providing stamped and addressed envelopes are kept at the Bureau. In preparing QSL’s new B.R.S. members should attempt, as far as they are able, to furnish detailed reports regarding the signals heard. The greatest care should also be exercised in recording call-signs, especially when the station heard is using telephony. In the past certain over-enthusiastic B.R.S. members have inundated the Society’s QSL Bureau with useless reports, with the result that the persons to whom the cards have been addressed, have declined to send an acknowledgment. As a general rule a distant station which is heard in contact with a station, for example, in Great Britain, has no interest in a report from a B.R.S. unless the sender of the report is able to furnish him with some useful technical or scientific data. Reports concerning local 1-7, 3-5 and 7 Me transmissions are in general of little value unless it is known that the transmitting amateur is carrying out special tests which necessitate the collection of a considerable amount of data. A detailed explanation of the functions and rules of the R.S.G.B. QSL Bureau is contained in a later chapter. Keeping a good log should be a duty of every amateur experimenter. Details of stations heard, notes concerning apparatus used and circuits tested, together with meteorological data all assist in the preparation of useful reports. Further, as experience is gained the observations can be tabulated and passed on to the Society’s Research and Experimental Groups, or contributions prepared for publication in the Bulletin. A useful style of log book ruling is illustrated. An important task undertaken by selected non transmitting members centres around the periodical checking of activity on the amateur bands of frequency. This work is organised by an ex perienced member of the Society, and the results obtained are of great value to the Council. A special certificate of appointment is issued to members who assist in these checks. From past experience it is recognised that the average person new to short-wave amateur work should spend at least six months as a B.R.S. before applying for transmitting facilities. During this period he should have been able to master a good working knowledge of the morse code, and further more he will have gained experience as regards the technical operation of transmitting gear. By studying carefully the latter part of this chapter a new member should rapidly master the amateur operation procedure used throughout the world. He will also have opportunities of meeting other and more experienced members who will gladly give him advice regarding amateur matters. “ The Helping Hand ” Every month an informative article appears under the above heading in the Society’s journal, T. &amp;■ R. Bulletin. The first four articles in the series dealt with the following subjects :— (1) “ Starting Amateur Radio.” (March, 1937.) (2) ‘‘ Receiving Equipment.” (April, 1937.) (3) ” Frequency Measuring Equipment.” (May, 1937.) (4) ” Using the Receiving Station.” (June, 1937.) Readers desirous of studying these articles, which were prepared for newcomers to Amateur Radio, may purchase the four issues of the Bulletin in which they appear for the special price of 2s. fid. Assuming that a member has progressed sufficiently far with his knowledge of short-wave work to warrant an application being made to the General Post Office for transmitting facilities, what steps should he now take ? The Artificial Aerial Licence As a general rule a B.R.S. member would be well advised to apply first of all for an Artificial Aerial Licence, for by so doing he will stand a better chance later on of obtaining a full licence. Great Britain is the only country in the world in which amateurs are permitted to construct and experiment with non-radiating transmitting apparatus, but permission to use such apparatus must, of course, be obtained from the G.P.O. Members desirous of obtaining an A.A. licence must apply to the Engineer-in-Chief, Radio Section. G.P.O., Armour House, London, E.C.l. They will receive an application form setting out certain technical questions, but the average member who has studied this handbook and other books on the subject should experience no great difficulty in finding suitable answers.140 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO In the event of a junior applying for a licence a parent or guardian is required to stand sponsor until he attains his majority. It is required by the terms of this licence (the fee for which is 10s. per annum) that the transmitting apparatus shall not be allowed to radiate outside the owner s premises ; in other words, some form of dummy aerial must be used. Information regarding artificial aerials is given on another page. Members possessing an A.A. licence may carry out every class of test, including modulation experiments, thereby obtaining valuable experience which will serve them in good stead when, at a later date, they commence work on an open aerial. Holders of A.A. licences are granted a three- letter call sign, beginning with the numeral 2 and followed by three letters (the letter E is not used in British Amateur Calls). Immediately an A-A. licence is issued members are requested to advise the Headquarters of the Society, so that their B.R.S. number may be cancelled. A. A. members, as a general rule, arrange to have their new call-sign printed on their QSL cards, as it is recognised that transition from the B.R.S. to the A.A. grade is an indication of advancement. These members, of course, continue to send and receive reports via the QSL Bureau. In some cases where a member has exceptional qualifications and is able to give sound technical reasons, a full licence is grants d immediately, but in general a younger member is encouraged to spend a few months as an A.A. licence holder, in order that he may become fully acquainted with the practical and theoretical side of transmission. Full Licences Applications for permission to use radiating apparatus must also be made to the Engineer-in- Chief, Radio Section, G.P.O., Armour House London, E.C.l. The applicant must be over 16 years of age, and if under 21 a parent or guardian must stand sponsor until he is of age. Applicants are re quired to answer certain questions as set out on the form supplied, and must give sound reasons for requiring permission to use radiating apparatus. They must satisfy the licensing authorities that a ei £ ex P er ^ men I s cannot be carried out with an Artificial Aerial, and must possess a good knowledge of the morse code. If their application is approved, a morse test—sending and receiving at a speed ol 12 words per minute for five minutes—must be passed, for which test a fee of 5s. is charged. In order to meet the conditions of the Inter- naLona 1 Radio Telegraphic Conventions held in Washington and Madrid, applicants must possess a piezo-electric (quartz) crystal which has been calibrated either by the Society's Calibration Manager or by a reliable crystal manufacturer. This crystal must have a fundamental frequency such that its harmonics fall inside the limits of the Amateur bands in which the station is licensed to operate. As a general rule a newlv licensed station wishing to work on the 7 and 14 Me bands will employ a crystal with a frequency between 3503 and 3598 kc. By means of tri-tet or frequency- doubler circuits the transmitter can then be operated on harmonics of this fundamental frequency in both of the above-mentioned bands. Those starting work on the 1-75 Me band, normally purchase crystals with fundamentals in this band, coupling the crystal oscillator stage direct to the aerial tuning circuit or via a buffer amplifier to the power amplifier. When the power supply available is small, such as in the case of stations dependent upon dry batteries, the use of piezo-electric crystal control is not important, providing every care is taken when adjusting the transmitter to prevent an unsteady or rough signal being emitted. Stations whose transmissions are not crystal controlled must, however, possess a calibrated crystal for use in a frequency meter. This crystal should preferably have a fundamental frequency in the 1-7 Me band in the region of 1754-1797 kc, as such a crystal will give harmonics in all the higher frequency amateur bands. In the case of newly licensed stations, the maximum input to the valve or valves delivering power to the aerial must not exceed 10 watts, but as is mentioned on page 157, Society members have the privilege of applying for use of higher power, after they have been licensed for six months. Normally, new licensees are granted permission to use the 1 ‘7, 7, and 14 Me bands, but they may at a later date apply direct to the G.P.O. for per mission to use the 28 and 56 Me bands. Authority to use the 3 -5 Me band is given to R.S.G.B. members recommended by the Council who have been licensed for at least 12 months. Members applying for permission to work on these special bands of frequency often find that greater consideration is given to their requests if they are members of the Society’s Research and Experi mental Sections, and are definitely engaged in research work in connection with some special issue. ^ British amateur stations are furnished with a call-sign commencing with the letter G, followed 1 e figure 2, 5, 6 or 8, and by a further two letters.

It will be appre ciated that the Council in supporting applications for special facilities assume a certain responsibility for the actions of those they nominate, hence they feel j ustified in taking every possible precaution before endorsing an application. Members wishing to apply for special facilities should apply to their District Representative, who will advise them upon the possibilities of their successful application. Transmitting Facilities The summary of conditions as issued by the G.P.O. under which persons resident in the British Isles may operate amateur transmitting stations are set out below. In publishing these conditions it must be understood that they may be modified at any time without notice by the authorities. They are published here as a guide to the type of requirements necessary and the conditions under which a licence will be issued. Authority for Sending and Receiving Note. —All sending stations must also be equipped for reception. (1) The applicant shall produce evidence of British nationality and two recent written references as to character. A certificate of birth should be furnished if possible ; but this will not be insisted on if the referees testify of their own knowledge that the applicant is of British nationality. The referees should be persons of British birth and of standing, not related to the applicant. If the applicant is under 21 years of age, evidence of British nationality and references should be fur nished both in respect of the applicant and of his parent or guardian. In the case of a company, society or other body, application should be made by one of the principals on behalf of the company, etc., who will be per sonally responsible for the observance of the terms of any licence granted. (2) The installation shall be subject to the approval of the Postmaster-General and shall be open to inspection at all reasonable times by properly authorised officers of the Post Office, who will produce their cards of identity on request. (3) Secrecy of correspondence shall be observed. (4) Applicants must satisfy the Postmaster- General as to their qualification and intention to conduct experiments of scientific value or public utility. If scientific research is intended they should be certified as competent investigators by a Govern ment Department or some recognised scientific body. Authority to use wireless sending apparatus, even with an “ artificial ” aerial (i.e., a practically non radiating aerial) can be granted only if the nature of the proposed experiments and other circum stances warrant that course. Sending Stations Authorised to use a Radiating Aerial (5) Each radiating station must be under the charge of a person who has satisfied the Postmaster- General, by examination or otherwise, that he has attained :— (a) an adequate knowledge of the adjustment and operation of the apparatus which he wishes to work; (5) an operating speed of at least 12 words (morse) a minute, sending and receiving. This qualification is necessary under international regulations, even when wireless telephony only is used. The person in charge of the station must be in a position to act upon instructions in the morse code issued by Government and commer cial stations. A fee of 5s. will be charged when the examination referred to above is necessary. The person in charge of a sending station must make himself acquainted with the regulations of the International Convention insofar as they relate to the prevention of interference and impose certain duties on all wireless operators. This information is contained in Section V of the Postmaster-General’s Handbook for Wireless Operators, which may be obtained through any bookseller, or direct from the Stationery Office, Adastral House, Kingsway. London, W.C.2, price 9d., postage 1$1. A licensee not possessing the necessary operating qualifications may be allowed, exceptionally, to employ a qualified operator to work and take charge of the sending apparatus. (6) Fees. —Small fees are payable in order to cover the Post Office expenses in connection with the grant of a licence and subsequent inspection, etc., of the station. For each station authorised to use power up to 10 watts the charges, which will cover also the use of receiving apparatus (for experimental pur poses only), will comprise an initial licensing fee of 10s., plus an annual fee of £1, payable in advance (i.e., 30s. for the first year and £\ for each suc ceeding year). Higher fees will be charged for more powerful stations. If apparatus is also used for receiving broadcast programmes for entertainment etc., a Wireless Receiving Licence (obtainable at most post offices, price 10s.) must be held. (7) Sending Frequencies. Sending will be limited to the bands of frequencies shown below. These bands represent those allocated by International Convention, less a tolerance to allow for frequency spreading due to modulation and possible frequency variations. The sending frequency should be selected within the bands shown below in order to ensure that crystal variation or transmitter instability shall not cause the frequency to vary outside them. Frequencies in Kilocycles per Second. Approximate equivalent Wavelengths (in Metres). 1720- 1995 174-4 -150-4 7005- 7295 42-83 - 41-12 14005-14395 21 -43 - 20-83 28010-29990* 10-71 - 10-00 56020-59980* 5-36 - 5-00 Note. —Special justification must be shown before sending in one or both of the bands marked * will be allowed. (8) Systems of Transmission .—Ordinarily trans mission will be limited to pure C.W. and telephony. The use of Spark sending apparatus will not in any circumstances be allowed. The use of unrectified alternating current for transmission will be forbidden. (9) Tuning; Measuring Instruments, etc. — The sending apparatus must always be tuned as accu rately as possible to the particular frequency within the authorised bands on which it is intended to send, and in this connection every licensee of a sendingA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO ■&gt; H2 station must satisfy the Postmaster-General that he possesses apparatus of the piezo-electric crystal, or other approved type, for accurately controlling or measuring the frequencies of the emissions. A certificate in respect of each crystal showing the degree of accuracy of calibration to be not less than 0*1 per cent, must be furnished. The licensee must also take all practical steps to maintain the accuracy of such controlling or measuring apparatus and must observe any detailed instructions to that end which may be issued by the Postmaster-General. Emissions must always be kept as stable as .possible (i.e., free from variation, other than neces sary modulation, from the frequency intended to be used), and must also be as free as possible from harmonics and other unessential emissions. (10) Communication Allowed. —A licensee will be allowed to send messages relating to his experiments to any station in this country which is co-operating in these experiments and also to co-operating stations in any country abroad, unless the Admini stration of that country has prohibited communica tion of this kind. (11) Aerials. —Dimensions allowed are as follows: —The length of the aerial (including the external part of the lead-in, or transmission line, if any, unless this is non-radiating) shall not exceed 150 feet. (12) Portable Stations .—General conditions same as for fixed stations. Power of portable stations will usually be limited to 10 watts. Lse will ordinarily be authorised only within a radius of 10 miles of a fixed point. Sending Stations Authorised to use an Artificial Aerial only (i.e., A Non- Radiating Aerial) (13) Morse qualifications are not essential. The fee payable is 10s. per annum. Overcoming the Language Difficulty The newcomer to amateur radio invariably enquires how it is possible for a British amateur to converse in morse with amateurs living in foreign countries who have no knowledge of English. The difficulty is largely overcome by the use of recognised abbreviations. These abbreviations fall into two categories, first those which have been inter nationally agreed to for maritime and fixed station use (the Q Code), and second, abbreviations based on English which have been devised by amateurs themselves. A typical morse message employing both types is given below r :— “ R ok mni tks fr QSO es nwQRU 73 esculgbom This translated into English becomes :—• “ Your message copied completely, many thanks for communicating with me and now as we have no further tests to conduct I will close down by wishing you good luck. I hope to see you later. Goodbye old man.” Thirty-two characters have replaced 161. In the example quoted, two Q code abbreviations have been used (QSO and QRU), the remainder being abbreviations devised by amateurs. The Q Code and a list of the more commonly used abbreviations, is given overleaf. It should be mentioned that numerous minor abbreviations, not listed, are often used but their meaning is usually obvious. INTERNATIONAL MORSE CODE.

QSA 2 Weak, readable now and then. QSA 3 Fairly good ; readable but with difficulty. QSA 4 Good ; readable. QSA 5 Very good ; perfectly readable. QRK Code (Audibility) Rl Faint signals ; just readable. R2 Weak signals ; barely readable. R3 Weak signals ; but can be copied. R4 Fair signals ; easily readable. R5 Moderately strong signals. R6 Good signals. R7 Good strong signals. R8 Very strong signals. R9 Extremely strong signals. Tone Code (Earlier method) Tl Poor 25, 50 or 60-cycle A.C. tone. T2 Rough A.C. tone. T3 Poor rectified A.C. tone. (No filter.) T4 Fair rectified A.C. tone. (Small filter.) T5 Nearly D.C. tone. (Good filter but key thumps or back \v r ave noticeable.) T6 Nearly D.C. (Very good filter.) T7 Pure D.C. (but key thumps and back wave noticeable). T8 Pure D.C. tone. T9 Pure crystal-controlled D.C. tone. 1935 by Mr. A. M. Braaten, W2BSR. The latter code is designed to give in a series of three numerals a complete and accurate report covering ' Reada bility,” “ Strength ” and “ Tone ” of the signals being received. It is usual when using this code to preface the numerical group with the letters- RST but many amateurs now' dispense with this introduction and give the report by means of the numerical group only, as for example, ” ur sigs 569x.” The ” x '' is added if the note appears to- be crystal-controlled. When using the International QSA, QRK code, it is usual to give a report in the following manner :— “ ur sigs QSA5 R6 T9.” RST Code Readability 1. Unreadable. 2. Barely readable, occasional words dis tinguishable. 3. Readable with considerable difficulty. 4. Readable with practically no difficulty. 5. Perfectly readable. Signal Strength 1. Faint, signals barely perceptible. 2. Very weak signals. 3. Weak signals. 4. Fair signals. 5. Fairly good signals. 6. Good signals. 7. Moderately strong signals. 8. Strong signals. 9. Extremely strong signals. Tone 1. Extremely rough hissing note 2. Very rough A.C. note, no trace of musicality. 3. Rough, low-pitched A.C. note, slightly musical. 4. Rather rough A.C. note, moderately musical. 5. Musically modulated note. 6. Modulated note, slight trace of whistle. 7. Near D.C. note, smooth ripple. 8. Good D.C. note, just a trace of ripple. 9. Purest D.C. note. (If the note appears to be crystal-con trolled add an x after the appropriate number.)

It should be remembered that the object of mathematical signs and symbols is to simplify and not to complicate problems. In addition to the information tabulated, the reader has available the invaluable Abacs published by Iliffe &amp; Sons, whilst for those who desire to obtain the answer to a problem by quick methods, the R.S.G.B. Sales Department can supply Lightning Calculators. A list of these is given in Chapter 15 under “ (e) Reference and Data Books.' At the request of readers of earlier editions a Wire Gauge Table has been included, together with amplified definitions of several formulre. The Metric System In this system all multiples and submultiples are decimal; multiples are expressed by Greek and submultiples by Latin prefixes. List of Metric Prefixes Sym bol. Value. Name.

N o confusion is likely to occur when the power of 10 involved is indicated, as in the second column of the above table. Linear Measures 1 inch =2-54 centimetres =25-4 millimetres. 1 foot = 30-48 centimetres = 304-8 millimetres. 1 yard = 0 -9144 metre. 1 mile = 1-6093 kilometres = 5,280 feet. 1 millimetre = 0-03937 inch. 1 centimetre = 0-3937 inch. 1 metre = 39-37 inches = 3-281 feet = 1-0936 yards. 1 kilometre = 0-6214 mile. 1 decimetre = 3-937 inches. 1 decametre = 10-936 yards.

Note.—Some Continental condensers have the capacity expressed in centimetres (1 cm = MlppF). Current (See Ohm’s Law). Decibel The decibel is one-tenth of the bel, and is the unit of power-level difference, i.e., a measure of gain or loss (attenuation). The number of decibels corresponding to a given power-ratio is 10 times the common logarithm of that ratio. N (db) = 10 log. l0 *f where P t = input power P 2 = output power Pi = power ratio. If the ratio is greater than 1 (unity) there is a power gain ; if the ratio is less than unity there is a power loss. In the latter case it is usual to invert the fraction and express the positive answer so obtained as a power loss. The decibel can also be used to express the ratio between voltages and currents, but in such calcu lations it is implied that the impedances and power factors of the circuits, with which the respective voltages and currents are associated, are identical: N = 2010^ N=.201og.„ Jj- Power-levels may also be expressed as the number of decibels by which the power-levels differ from an arbitrary reference power-level, known as zero power-level, which, in America, is usually 0-006 watts, or 6 milliwatts, and in Europe is 0-001 watts, or 1 milliwatt. Thus, a gain is stated as “ up ” or plus db, and a loss as “ down ’ or “ minus db.” 1 he decibel is also used to express difference in level in acoustics. In this case the arbitrary zero acoustic pressure level is generally taken as 1 dyne/cm 2 , and velocity level as Icm/sec. The phon is the measure of acoustic loudness level and is expressed in the same way as the decibel. t L ( / n t / C 1 I I 1 &lt; c I (A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO The zero level of loudness, i.e. 0 phons, corresponds to a pressure of -0007 dynes/cm 2 at 400 c.p.s.

It must be once more pointed out that the lists are not intended to be exhaustive, as Foreign, Trade, Institution and Society publications are not included ; but in one or more of the books mentioned the reader should be able to find sufficient data to satisfy his requirements. Under the heading “ Miscellaneous ” will be found several books that may not appear to be of direct interest to the radio amateur, but in view of the increasing importance of the ultra-short and micro-waves in therapeutic treatment, and in bacteriological and pathological research, a study of such works will prove of great interest, and, indeed, may lead to experiments and subsequent discoveries of value to humanity. Also several meteorological books are named, as a knowledge of this subject is necessary to those engaged on radio-wave propagational problems. The most noticeable alteration to previous lists is the inclusion, under “ Reference and Data Books,” of a list of “ Lighting Calculators ” published by the American Radio Relay League (A.R.R.L.). It is felt that these will be welcomed by newcomers and ” old hands ” alike, as they represent a means of performing speedy and accurate computations of those common calculations that crop up every day in radio work.

For twenty-four years the Society has been the National organisation responsible for the furtherance of interest in the amateur radio movement within the British Isles, and in more recent years has linked the radio amateurs of the British Empire together through the medium of its overseas section, known as “ The British Empire Radio Union.” The Society enjoys the privilege of acting as spokesman for British amateurs whenever matters affecting their welfare are under discussion. It numbers within its ranks many of the pioneer experimenters who were responsible for the development of international short-wave radio communication and it has had as Past-Presidents such eminent personalities as Sir Oliver Lodge, Admiral Sir Henry Jackson, Brig.-General Sir Capel Holden, Sir Ian Fraser, Professor Eccles, Mr. A. A. Campbell Swinton, Mr. H. Bevan Swift, Mr. A. E. Watts and Mr. Gerald Marcuse. The latter was responsible for the initial experiments which led up to the inauguration of Empire broadcasting. Membership Membership is granted to those expressing a genuine interest in the science of radio. An applicant must be proposed by a member, or he may submit two references from householders who can testify that he has been interested in radio matters for a period of not less than one year. All applications are dealt with by the Council on the second Tuesday in each month, and advice of election is communicated without delay. On election each Corporate member receives a certificate of distinctive design, whilst a special coat badge is available. Members’ notepaper, call books, and other technical books are kept in stock and may be purchased from Society Headquarters. The membership of the Society was 3,200 during July, 1937. Grades of Membership There are three grades of membership, viz. :— Home Corporate Members, Overseas Corporate Members, Associates. The Associate Grade is designed to cater for non-technical persons resident within the British Isles. Members in this grade have no voting powers, but they receive a copy of the T. &amp; R. Bulletin, and may attend Society meetings. They are not permitted to use the QSL service and are not granted a B.R.S. number. Persons holding Post Office experimental licences are debarred from applying for admission to the Associate Grade. 153 The Society is incorporated under the Companies Acts, 1908-1937. Subscriptions- The scale of annual subscriptions is as follows :— Town Corporate Members Country Corporate Members (resident outside a radius of 25 miles from Charing Cross, London) Overseas Corporate Members ... Associates (Non-Corporate) Subscriptions date from the first of the month in which a member is elected, and are renewable annually upon that date. Organisation The affairs of the Society are controlled by a Council of Radio amateurs who meet at least once a month at Society Headquarters. Frequently several of those serving on the Council are Provincial members. The general organisation of the Society’s work is in the hands of a permanent Secretary, himself a well-known amateur, who for several years prior to his appointment in 1932 held the position of Honorary Secretary. With few exceptions the Executive members of the Society are actively engaged in experimental work on one or more of the amateur bands; con sequently their practical knowledge of operating conditions is of the utmost value when matters of general policy are discussed. Numerous committees are appointed annually. PRIVILEGES The “T. &amp; R. Bulletin ” Without doubt the Society’s Journal, known as the T. &amp;■ R. Bulletin, offers the most important privilege of membership. Prior to the year 1925 the Society was dependent upon the good offices of The Wireless World, and latterly Experimental Wireless, for publicity and general information relating to amateur radio matters, but with the opening up of international long-distance communi cation, coupled with a general increase in short wave interest, it became desirable to consider the publication of a Society journal which would provide a link with all its members. From its inception in July, 1925, the Bulletin has aimed at providing up-to-the-minute news on every phase of amateur activity, and for over twelve years it has remained the principal source of information for short-wave and experimental radio enthusiasts at home and in many parts of the British Empire. The reader of this handbook will most Ukely have seen a copy of the Bulletin (as it is familiarly called)154 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO and, therefore, lengthy comment on the quality and excellence of the reading matter provided is unneces sary. It should, however, be more generally known that this is an all-amateur magazine, written by and for amateurs. The aim of the paper is to disseminate information in a simple and practical form which can be understood by all readers. It is in being essentially as a means of linking members together, and for the purpose of keeping them abreast on all matters of amateur interest. It is neither highbrow nor lowbrow, but attempts to please all by pursuing a sound general policy aimed at meeting the wishes of the majority of members. Constructional articles written by well-known amateurs on subjects of current interest permit members to follow at their own stations the latest trend of progress. Descriptions of amateur stations, both at home and abroad, are a popular feature, as are the semi-humorous articles which appear under the signature of ' Uncle Tom.” District and Empire notes cover the local activities of groups of members, whilst the “ Research and Experimental Sections ” notes contain informative comments and short articles dealing with subjects of current or general interest. 'The Month on the Air” provides a running commentary on all matters of interest to those working on the DX bands. Details are given of unusual stations heard and worked, together with frequencies used. The Helping Hand,” introduced in April, 1937, is the title given to a series of articles especially designed for the newcomer to amateur radio. Helpful advice is given on every aspect of the subject and readers of this handbook who are desirous of studying the earlier contributions may purchase back issues at a nominal price of Is. per copy or 2s. 6d. for the four issues (April-July, 1937, inclusive). Valve Reviews and Trade Reviews prepared by qualified members enable readers to select material for their work with first-hand knowledge of its expectations. All important radio books are reviewed by a prominent member who is specially qualified for this work. The T. &lt;5- R. Bulletin is printed on good quality paper, and is sent post free to members in a patented wrapper on or about the 15th of each month. Each issue, which contains upward of 56 pages, is well illustrated by diagrams and photographs. Small advertisements which are published at very low rates enable members to sell and exchange apparatus to advantage, whilst the main advertising pages contain announcements by most of the leading manufacturers. The necessity for supporting such advertisers is of paramount importance, and all members are urged to patronise them and to mention the name of the Society when purchasing material. Those desirous of examining a specimen copy of the current issue are invited to forward Is. to Society Headquarters. QSL Service Next to the T. &amp; R. Bulletin the Society’s QSL Service is regarded as the most important privilege of membership Many years ago the Council of the R.S.G.B. realised that a useful service would be rendered to its members if their report (QSL) cards addressed to other amateurs at home and abroad could be collected at one central spot and dispatched in batches at regular intervals. Without such an arrangement the active amateur would be compelled to send each card separately at a considerable annual cost. Fortunately amateur organisations in other parts of of the world realised the value of establishing similar International QSL Bureaux, with the result that to-day practically every country is in a position to accept and dispatch cards in bulk. In most countries a charge is made for this service, but the R.S.G.B. have adhered to a policy of giving this service free, as a privilege of membership. Members requiring to send cards for distribution post them to the Headquarters of the Society at regular intervals, usually monthly or when the nmnber of cards reaches two or three dozen. On receipt, the cards are filed into pigeon-holes from whence they are collected once a week, tied into bundles and dispatched to official QSL Bureaux all over the world. Cards intended for British amateurs are handled in a similar way and are cleared at regular intervals. Members wishing to collect cards from the Society’s QSL Section are required to send stamped addressed envelopes to Headquarters. The Society can also arrange to supply stamped and addressed envelopes at a price of 2d. each. Members are recommended to keep a small stock of envelopes at Headquarters, as this prevents delays when dealing with cards. Periodically the files are examined and in cases where an accumulation has occurred, due to the person concerned having no envelopes on hand, a postcard is forwarded requesting collection. Amateurs who fail to collect their cards cause unnecessary work at the Bureau, and if, after advice has been given, the cards are unclaimed, they are disposed of. The Society is opposed to the principle of destroying cards but for obvious reasons accumula tions must be cleared at intervals. The R.S.G.B. QSL Bureau is probably the largest self-contained national bureau in the world, and as an indication of its effectiveness, well over a quarter of a million cards are dealt with annually. During recent years, owing to the enormous increase in the numbers of alleged useless reports, the R.S.G.B. has been compelled to refuse cards from non-transmitting members which refer to European transmissions heard on 3 -5, 7 and 14 Me. Cards for British Isles stations are of course accepted. Report cards addressed to amateurs in the U.S.A., Canada and Newfoundland are also refused for the reason previously stated, it having been contended by the National QSL Bureaux of these countries that listeners’ reports are of no general interest when sent in batches. Members wishing to report on North American amateur signals should forward them direct by consulting the latest edition of the Radio Amateur’s Call Book on sale at Headquarters of the R.S.G.B. The following rules govern the operation of the Bureau insofar as it affects cards addressed to members :— (1) Overseas members may not collect their cards direct from R.S.G.B., except when no QSL Bureau exists in their country. (2) Envelopes must be stamped by the sender and clearly addressed. (3) The sender’s call sign must be printed in block letters in the top left-hand corner of the envelope. (4) Envelopes must be of a standard size (7 J inches by 4£ inches) or as near to these dimensions as possible.A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 155 (5) The Section cannot undertake to forward envelopes at stated intervals. (6) Envelopes are despatched where possible when there are three cards in file for one call sign. In the case of cards from members, the following rules apply:— (1) Cards reporting reception of European and North American amateur transmissions on 3-5, 7 and 14 Me cannot be accepted for distribution. (2) Individual cards must not be placed in individual envelopes, but must be sorted into countries, and despatched to the Bureau in a complete packet. If it is desired to send photo graphs these must be pasted to the backs of the cards. (3) Letters cannot be accepted for distribution, as they are not permitted under the postal rate at which cards are sent abroad. (4) The call sign of the person to whom a card is addressed must be written clearly, and in large letters so that it can be seen at a glance. If the space on the face of the card is insufficient or obscure, the call sign should be written clearly on the back. (5) All packets should be weighed carefully before dispatch. Overweight packets of cards for which a postage due fee is demanded by the Post Office will be refused. (6) QSL cards should not exceed the usual dimensions of ordinary postcards, viz., 5£ inches by 3$ inches. (Cards larger than this are most difficult to handle and invariably have to be doubled in half in order to despatch them.) (7) All QSL cards should be addressed to the QSL Section R.S.G.B., 53 Victoria Street, London, S.W.l, which is the only address of the Section. QRA Service One of the most up-to-date QRA services in the world is operated by the Society. It is the function of the Section Manager to tabulate all call signs and addresses, and to provide the publishers of the Radio Amateur’s Call Book with this information, thus ensuring that the British section is always up-to-date. Furthermore, members desiring particulars of a new station heard or worked may often obtain details from the QRA Section many weeks before the call sign and address of the station in question appear in the Call Book. Upon receiving their A.A. or full licence, members should advise the Section Manager ; they should also advise him promptly of any change of address. Calibration Service The regulations governing the issue of experi mental transmitting licences require that every licensee should satisfy the Postmaster-General that he possesses apparatus of the piezo-electric crystal or other approved type for accurately measuring the frequencies of his transmissions. In applying for a transmitting permit it is neces sary to produce a certificate of the accuracy of the crystal which is to be used, but in many cases amateurs grind their own crystals, and such a cer tificate is not obtainable, as it is in the case of an amateur who purchases his crystals from a reputable firm. The Calibration Section of the Society will issue a certificate in respect of such a crystal, which will be accepted as prima facie evidence of its accuracy by the General Post Office. The calibration service is also of great value to licensed amateurs who have constructed a new frequency meter, or who have reason to doubt the accuracy of their present apparatus. The R.S.G.B. Frequency Meter (described in the T. &amp;R. Bulletin, December 1932, and January 1933) is used in conjunction with a 100-00 kc quartz bar frequency sub-standard and multi-vibrator. This instrument can, if desired, give accuracies better than 0-01 per cent. Temperature control of the 100 kc frequency sub-standard is available for precision laboratory work. The cost of a single calibration at a national laboratory frequently exceeds the cost of a year s subscription to the Society. Admittedly the accuracy from the primary standard is beyond reproach, but such accuracy is unnecessary in amateur stations ; furthermore, the conditions of calibration are never so faithfully reproduced as to make such accuracy necessary. The Calibration Service is maintained for amateurs by amateurs with an understanding of their requirements. The rules governing the calibration of members crystals and meters follow. Crystals (1) Transverse oscillators of the plate type are accepted for calibration in the following frequency ranges:—1,700-2,000 kc, 3,500—4,000 kc, and 7,000-7,300 kc. Calibration fee, Is. 6d., postage (2) Longitudinal oscillators of the bar type, 50 kc or 100 kc. Calibration fee, 2s. 6d., postage extra. Frequency Meters. (1) Frequency meters of the heterodyne type, covering the frequency ranges allotted for amateur transmission, are accepted for calibration. (2) Absorption frequency meters of wide range are unsuitable for calibration, as are buzzer frequency meters of obsolete types. Properly constructed absorption frequency meters of limited range may be accepted, but an enquiry describing the instru ment and enclosing a stamped addressed envelope should first be addressed to the Calibration Manager. Calibration fee, 5s. for 5 points; additional points, 6d. per point at any required interval. Postage extra. Members should be careful to ensure that ap paratus is in proper working order and that it covers the frequency ranges specified. Faulty apparatus will be returned to the sender as unsuitable for calibration. The Calibration Section will endeavour to accom modate members as far as possible, and apparatus with frequency ranges other than those already specified may 'be accepted provided an enquiry is first addressed to the Calibration Manager. Care should be taken that articles sent for cali bration (particularly crystals) are securely packed as they are only accepted for calibration at owner s risk. Return postage on crystals and frequency meters must be remitted as a separate amount. Accuracy of Calibration All measurements are made with an accuracy better than 0-01 per cent., but whether the articles sent for calibration can reproduce such accuracy depends upon the conditions under which they are used and their inherent stability. For precision work the section can give calibrations within one part in 10 5 , but special arrangements must be made for this service.156 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO Research &amp; Experimental Sections The Research and Experimental Sections are the natural development of an organisation which was originally known as Contact Bureau. This was instituted by Mr. T. Palmer Allen, of Belfast, many years ago for the purpose of pooling all knowledge dealing with the many different aspects of radio, by co-operation between members interested in common subjects. The work of the Bureau developed so rapidly that in 1934 the Council of the R.S.G.B. decided to reconstitute it under the title of the Research and Experimental Section. Continued progress made it necessary in 1935 to reorganise the membership into Sections, each dealing with particular fundamental branches of radio, the whole forming the Research and Experi mental Sections of the Society. The Sections are controlled by an R.E.S. Manager and an assistant, who are responsible to Council. Each Section is managed by a Section Manager responsible to the R.E.S. Manager. Still further changes in the organisation of the Research and Experimental Sections are contem plated in order to cater more effectively for the increase in interest in this work. The following subjects are at present being studied by the sections : No. 1, Transmitter Design ; No. 2, Receiver Design ; No. 3, Aerial Design ; No. 4, Propagation ; No. 5, Valves and Instruments ; No. 6, Auxiliary Apparatus ; No. 7, Micro-waves (112 Me and above) ; No. 8, Contemporary Literature. Sec tions are divided into groups of members under the charge of Group Managers, and where numbers warrant it, these groups are again subdivided into smaller groups of about six members under the care of Group Centres. In addition to Group Members, Sections cater for Individual Members, who concen trate upon their problems individually and inde pendently of the groups. These members are directly responsible to the Section Manager. Membership of the two types, i.e., ' Group ” and Individual,” which constitute the ' Experi mental ” side of the Sections, is open to all fully paid-up members of the R.S.G.B. In addition, there are a few specially chosen members known as ' Research Members,” who are appointed by the R.E.S. Manager, and who are qualified to undertake research into their respective branches of the subject. Included in the Contemporary Literature Section are several linguists who translate letters and articles for the benefit of all sections. It cannot be overemphasised that, in many aspects of radio research, co-operation is essential if headway is to be made. This is achieved among the Group Members by a system of ' Letter Budgets ” circulated round the membership, by means of which knowledge is passed between the Section Manager and the latest recruit. All are invited to make contributions to these Letter Budgets and to add their comments. Members on joining a section receive a certificate of membership. Rules for the guidance of members are issued to all new members enrolled into the sections. The R.E.S. Manager is Mr. H. C. Page, G6PA, Plumford Farm, Ospringe, Faversham, Kent, who will be glad to hear from all intending members. Licence Facilities From the earliest days of the amateur movement the R.S.G.B. has enjoyed the privilege of working in close co-operation with the British Post Office, and on numerous occasions the Council have been consulted by them before changes to operating conditions have been made effective. Periodical conferences take place between Post Office officials and R.S.G.B. representatives, whilst an excellent liaison also exists between the Society and the Departments controlling the Navy, Army and Air Force Radio services. The importance of these close relations cannot be too strongly emphasised. Prior to International Telecommunication Con ferences, which take place once every five years, Council representatives of the R.S.G.B. discuss with the Government delegates all amateur matters likely to arise at the Conference. The R.S.G.B. is the British Isles Member Society in the International Amateur Radio Union. Union representation at International Telecommuni cation Conferences is of vital importance. At the Madrid Conference the R.S.G.B. representative was Mr. Arthur E. Watts. Shortly after the early discoveries leading up to the development of long-distance short-wave com munications, the Society applied for and was *&gt; V 60- so- 40 - *&gt;- to- fO- &gt;900 Kc n 2 S V /4 2 % -—- fiMft TE OR BONDS S&amp; /Yc Scale drawing showing frequency relation of British Amateur Bands. Range of frequencies in true harmonic relation lies between dotted lines, i.e., between LF end of 3.5 Me and HF end of 14 Me. Left-hand scale enables crystals to be selected for harmonic operation, multiplying fy 2 - an( l 32 to obtain corresponding frequencies in 3 5, 7,14, 28 and 56 Me bands respectively. For example, a crystal of frequency 1,830 kc would produce harmonics in 3.5, 28 and 56 Me bands only ; similarly, a 7,280 kc crystal (1,820 on scale) would be suitable for harmonic working on 28 and 56 Me, multiplying factors for these two bands being 4 and 8 in this case. This drawing also shows how the coverage of frequency meters should be adjusted for maximum utility. j'rantf mir ii nme i tinued furthe relates This i those genuir Provit requir to th&lt; permi crysta freque 3 5 M Dui obtair watt j sive £ was a for sp year agreec used 1 as hit Nm opera bands grant' negot Mei powei instru Bullet tions an an and v the G In mittii bye-k facilit tion licens is mac these fully are n but 1 incres via a to COl Ap consii in eai Pri of th parts 80, 6( dema vices it be' band: At perm allot! missi Sp. use c desiri catioiA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 157 granted permission to recommend qualified members ■or increased power facilities, and from that ^time until the present day, the R.S.G.B. has con tinued to render this service to its members. A further privilege open to transmitting members relates to the use of the 3-5 Me (80-metre) band. This is known as a “ shared ” band and therefore those using it must satisfy the authorities of the genuineness of the experiments they wish to conduct. Providing a member can show good reason for requiring the use of this band, he may apply to the Council of the Society for the necessary permission. He must give a guarantee to use crystal control or some other recognised method of frequency control, when applying ior high power or 3 5 Me facilities. During 1936 the Society was instrumental in obtaining the agreement of the G.P.O. to issue 25- watt permits to recommended members at an inclu sive licensing fee of 30s. per annum. The Society was also granted authority to recommend members for special 56 Me portable permits. In the same year the G.P.O., at the request of the Society, agreed to allow aerials up to 150 feet in length to be used for transmitting purposes instead of 100 feet as hitherto. Numerous other important improvements in operating facilities, including widened frequency bands and amateur television licences, have been granted to British amateurs as a direct result of negotiations between the Society and the G.P.O. Members desirous of applying for increased power are recommended to read the special instructions which were published in the T. &amp; R. Bulletin, September, 1934, page 99. These instruc tions are used by the G.P.O. in deciding whether an amateur has qualified for a High Power permit, and were reproduced with the special permission of the G.P.O. Licensing Section. In order to safeguard the interests of all trans mitting members the Council have prepared certain bye-laws governing the recommendation of increased facilities, chief of which is a rule preventing applica tion being made until after a member has been licensed for a period of 12 months. An exception is made in regard to applications for 25-watt permits ; these may be applied for after a member has been fully li censed for six months. No technical reasons are necessary when applying for 25-watt permits, but these applications and all others concerning increased facilities must be submitted to the Council via a member’s District Representative, who is asked to comment upon each application. Applications for increased licensing facilities are considered by the Council on the second Tuesday fn each month. Prior to the Washington Conference the amateurs of the world were permitted to operate in various parts of the waveband spectrum near to 160, 90, 80, 60, 45, 40, 23 and 20 metres, but with increasing demands for wavelength allocations by other ser vices (Broadcasting, Commercial and Government) it became necessary to allot definite international bands of wavelength for amateur use. At the present moment British amateurs are permitted to work in any one of the six bands allotted by the Madrid Conference, providing per mission has been granted by the G.P.O. Special authority may also be obtained for the use of frequencies higher than 56 Me. Members desiring such facilities must submit a technical appli cation to the G.P.O. outlining the nature of the experiments to be conducted. Frequency alloca tions around 112, 224 and 448 Me are allotted for ultra-high frequency amateur experiments. As mentioned in an earlier chapter, frequency stabilisation is very necessary in order that no transgression from the band width allowed occurs ; consequently the British Government have decided to fix marker points just inside the Washington bands. Before buying crystals, members should get in touch with their District Representative in order that he may advise the best frequency to use; by this means local interference can be greatly minimised. Several well-known manufacturers can supply crystals ground to very accurate limits at reasonable prices, and for that reason every new member should purchase at least one crystal before embarking on a transmitting career. Crystals are of great value as a means of cali brating frequency (or wave) meters. Applicants for a full licence are required to send to the G.P.O. the calibration certificate for their crystal. The valuable service rendered by the Society’s Calibra tion Section in this connection is mentioned in an earlier part of this chapter. Organised Tests The importance of organised tests cannot be overestimated, for not only do they assist members to improve the design of their stations, but by virtue of their competitive nature they bring to the fore the best in each entrant. All Society contests are organised with a view to encouraging experi mental interest in some definite direction ; the awarding of trophies follows as a recognition of individual prowess. The most important annual test organised by the Society is that known as the B.E.R.U. Contest. This is an all-Empire event and takes place during the month of February, when, as a general rule, conditions for long-distance work are at their best. For seven years this contest has been supported by most of the well-known amateurs in the Empire, and it is appropriate that the Senior Trophy should already have been won by amateurs located in Australia, Great Britain, New Zealand and Egypt. For the first two years only one contest was arranged, but during 1932 it was decided to organise a Senior and a Junior event, the latter being for the benefit of those only able to use an input power of 25 watts or less. Concurrent with these transmitting contests, a receiving contest is arranged for non-transmitting members. The leading R.S.G.B. member in each section of the contest holds the appropriate Challenge Trophy for one year, and special certificates of merit are presented to the leading stations in each country. Local contests for home members are arranged periodically, whilst Field Days devoted to operation on one or more of the recognised amateur bands of frequency are popular summertime events in most districts. The most important annual outdoor contest takes place during a week-end in June, when each District places in operation two or more portable stations. This event is known throughout the world as National Field Day, and, although only introduced by the R.S.G.B. in 1933, it has become established as one of the most instructive and social projects of the year.1 ) I 158 A GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO The primary object of National Field Day is to prepare members for any condition of emergency which might render it necessary to place in operation portable stations at short notice. Such a necessity is unlikely to arise in the British Isles, but in other parts of the world valuable service has been rendered by radio amateurs after earth quakes, tornadoes and floods. During the years 1934-1936 the R.S.G.B. spon sored International 28 Me (10-metre) Contests which aroused interest in every country, and did much to popularise work on this band of frequencies where the characteristics are still very much unknown. To encourage co-operative effort on the 56 Me band the R.S.G.B. recently organised a National 56 Me Field Day, whilst numerous subsidiary field events have been conducted by groups of members in different parts of the British Isles. The Society possesses Trophies valued at more than ^100 and these are awarded annually to either the winners of contests or to those who have made some notable contribution to the Society. A complete list of Society Trophies and a des cription of special certificates is given in a separate pamphlet available on request from Society Head quarters. The W.B.E. and H.B.E. Certificates Transmitting members are eligible to qualify for the Society’s certificate (known as the W.B.E.) which is awarded to those who have established two-way communication with British Empire amateur radio stations in the five continents of the world. Separate W.B.E.’s are issued for Telegraphy, Telephony and 28 Me work. In all cases members must guarantee that their licensed power was not exceeded when making the contacts, whilst a minimum report of R3 or QSA3 must be recorded on the cards submitted as evidence. A certificate known as the H.B.E. (Heard the British Empire) has recently been introduced. This is awarded to members of the Society who can produce evidence showing that they have received transmissions from amateur stations located in not less than 25 different parts of the British Empire. At least three countries must be heard in each Continent to qualify for this award. An illustration of the W.B.E. Certificate Issued for 28 Me work. The rules governing the issuance of W.B.E. and/ H.B.E. Certificates can be obtained from Society^' Headquarters on receipt of a Tjd. stamp. The W.A.C. Certificate By virtue of the fact that the R.S.G.B. is the National Society of Great Britain, its transmitting members may qualify for the special award (known as the W.A.C.), issued by the International Amateur Radio Union, to amateurs who have estabhshed two-way communication with stations in six con tinents of the world (North and South America rank as two continents for this award). QSL cards or other evidence must be forwarded to the Secretary, R.S.G.B. London Meetings Regular meetings of the Society are held during the Winter session (September to April) at the Institution of Electrical Engineers, London, where lectures and demonstrations of new apparatus are given. An Annual Convention is held in London when a large number of London, Provincial and Overseas members meet together for the purpose of exchanging ideas. Radio Exhibitions Annually, during the Radio Manufacturers Association Exhibition held in London, the R.S.G.B. maintains a stand on which are displayed short-wave transmitters, receivers, etc., embodying the latest designs. This stand is the meeting-place of radio amateurs from all parts of the world. R.S.G.B. Headquarters The Headquarters of the Society are located in Victoria Street, London, S.W.l, and are within a few minutes of St. James Park Underground Station. New members may purchase from Headquarters Handbooks, Call Books, etc., whilst members may obtain badges, notepaper, car plaques, etc., and certain publications at reduced prices. A full list of material available from Headquarters is given in a separate page. Arrangements have been made to display a range of radio manufacturers’ apparatus in the lounge at R.S.G.B. Headquarters; thus, Provincial and Overseas Members may examine at their leisure a range of components manufactured specially for their needs. For the information of readers the normal office hours in vogue at R.S.G.B. Head quarters are : weekdays 9.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m., and Saturdays 9.30 a.m. to 12 noon. HOME REPRESENTATION In order to effect a close link between Home members and the Council of the Society, arrange ments are made annually to appoint well-known amateurs as District Representatives. These members are, in effect, Council’s Representatives in the Provincial and London Districts, and it is their duty to act as a liaison in all matters affecting policy. They are responsible for the organisation of Provincial District Meetings and Conventionettes. The former are official R.S.G.B. functions and are attended by the Secretary and other Executive Officers. At such meetings an outline is given of the Society’s progress and all members are afforded the opportunity of asking questions of general interest. District Representatives are assisted in their work by Town Representatives who are elected annuallyA GUIDE TO AMATEUR RADIO 159 by local members of the Society. T.R.'s are respon sible for the organisations of local meetings and for hhe collection of news items for inclusion in the District Notes and News Section of the T. &amp; R. Bulletin. There are at present 18 Districts in England and Wales, seven in Scotland, and one in Northern Ireland. New members are asked to communicate with their local representatives as soon as elected, in order that they may become acquainted.

THE BRITISH EMPIRE RADIO UNION The British Empire Radio Union is the name given to that section of the R.S.G.B. membership resident within the British Empire, and includes Britishers living in Foreign countries. The B.E.R.U. was officially recognised as the overseas section of the Society during 1929, but prior to that date many well-known Colonial amateurs were in association with the R.S.G.B. The Union to-day represents a large proportion of the active British Empire amateur transmitting fraternity. Some little while after the recognition of the B.E.R.U. Section, Dominion and Colonial Societies were invited to affiliate themselves to the B.E.R.U. of Societies, in order that, should the necessity arise, mutual assistance could be accorded to one another. The B.E.R.U. of Societies is not a part of the R.S.G.B. but a separate body of which the R.S.G.B. is a Member Society. The Society is continually in communication with Licensing Authorities in other parts of the Empire in connection with matters relating to amateur licences. In several instances successful negotiations have resulted in improved facilities being granted. Immediately the B.E.R.U. membership in a particular part of the Colonial Empire, where no National Society exists, reaches a predetermined level, arrangements are made to appoint one member as an official B.E.R.U. Representative. Where a National Society exists this representative usually acts as a direct liaison between the Council of the' R.S.G.B. and the Executive of his National Society. He also functions as a publicity officer on behalf of the R.S.G.B. A further duty is to forward each month by amateur radio, or by letter, a report covering the activities of the members in his country. A list of B.E.R.U. Section Representatives appears regularly in the T. &lt;§&gt;• R. Bulletin.
