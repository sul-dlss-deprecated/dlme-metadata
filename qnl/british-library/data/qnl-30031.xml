He said now that State was in sound financial position, he wished to 'do something more for his people' hut felt any real advance Vw&amp;s impossible without hole of 'foreign adviser'.

Sultan has no objection to loan of officer in Government service but 'would wish to know if hb had knowledge arable and Ar ao co unti* i e s ' . My comments arc in following paragraphs:- 4. It is clear from the verbal and written requests that Sultan fools need of both an adviser and an administrative official nd that, he proposes to combine the functions in one poi son. Sultan seems to think that there will be civil air development in his State and if he feels to need advice on this it is obviously desirable that it should come from an accepted British official. He is on s stronger ground as ragards development and general progress and it is gratifying that he turns to us for assistance. On this alone it is \ desirable I think to find him an official to avoid.his seeking *' elsewhere. 5. As regards 2(a) past officers have been styled Financial Adviser and/or V/azifi and present suggestion raises do ibt tor I do not think Sultan really intends to make a British Official a Minister for Foreign Affairs. This point can be considered later. (b) and (c). The present situation is oad and needs rectifying which cannot be done by any present state employee. (d) Sultan needs a loyal and energetic official to visit his scattered walls who, but for visits at very long intervalsintervalsy arc parotically independent ot state control. % (e). There is scon^ ervp loveloprnent in ^edicalj cducationa2v&gt;%vv*&lt;^ Communications also need attention. (f) . Uuab'ul Hussein holds this post and Sultan has not raised question of his continued employment otter t f ay 1945. (g) . Point that Sultan does not raise is very urgent need for liaison by capable state official with P.A.F. to attend to problem of Mast rah labour such * pay, living conditions, rat '.one. medical attention, compensation. 6. Sultan makes no mention of salary but he will be prepared to offer suitable do carrioro Government servant usual terms and conditions and correspondingly to any other officer. It is difficult to estimate accurately the financial position but the State*s income is sufficient to moot the cost. 7. He paragraph Ho 3 both arc necessary,I think. ?. I recommend the Sultan*s proposal and hope that it will be found possible to introduce some one to him early.Tolegi'a: From F(Pad) Political ^gcut, ’'uscat.

Hallows, Assistant Political Agent, Salalah, to H.H. the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. The wish, expressed by Your Highness yesterday, that enquiries be made regarding the possibility of finding a British Officer to advise and assist you in the affairs of Muscat, has been communicated to His Majesty's Consul at Muscat. Your Highness stressed your desire for development and progress in Muscat in the various fields of administration, particularly that of education, and I understood Your Highness to say thet to implement this desire, you felt that you W( uld require the assistance and advice of an experienced British Officer. Your Highness also mentioned that y&lt;u felt the need for such an adviser fee in dealing with such major questions as negotiations for civil air line facilities, matters connected with oil concession^ and others. Your Highness, I think, saw no objection to an officer being loaned for this purposefrom one of the Services of my Government. To enable the Government of Ind*La to take up the qi^stion, it is probable that they will require more details as to the position this officer will occupy in yc%ir State and the functions that will be entrusted to him. Could Your Highness let me have an outline of your proposals so far as this is concerned so that a clear idea can be formed as to the qualifications an adviser should possess? 1 I should hiso be grateful if Your Highness would kindly confirm that I have understood the matter correctly. 5four Highness' sincere friend. — vral'Copy of letter Hated the 18th. March, 1945, from Said bin Tammur, The Sultan of Muscat &amp; Oman, Dhofar to Mr. R.I. Hallows, Asst, to H.B.M's Consul, Muscat, at Salalah. y . / After Comoliments, Thank you for your letter dated the 9th. March, 1945, in regard to the appointment of a British Officer to the service of our Government. Since we first mentioned the matter to you in the general terms stated in your letter, we have given the question our further consideration and hope that what follows will make our wishes clear and provide you* with the information you require. Firstly, it is our wish to acquire the services of a British Officer to be appointed as our Minister for Foreign Affairs. The nature of tAie duties and responsibilities which at present attach to this post are known to you, and it is our intention that the officer should take full charge of them. All important matters - for instance those which concern our policy and the Treaty - would receive our personal attention as before, though we may require the British Officer to assist and advice in any matters which we saw fit to refer to him. Secondly, while it is our desire that the officer whose services we wish to acquire, be designated our Minister for Foreign Affairs, and that he should occupy himself principally with the affairs of that post we should wish to entrust to him certain additional responsibilities of which the more important are as follows (a) We may require him to act as our Financial Adviser,. (b) He would take over the Municipal administration of Muscat and Mutrah. ■J (c) We should desire him to hold a watching brief over the officials of our Government and to settle any matters which arise between them in our absence from Muscat. He would make tours of our territories (Ras-al-Hadd to Malahah) for this purpose and for tHe'~purpose of enabling him to make proposals to us for improvements in the administrations. (d) We should require him to examine the various fields for development and the possibilities for obtaining progressive improvement in the welfare of our people, and to advise us on these matters. We shall be cp_ad to be informed whether a suitable officer can be found for the purposes we have mentioned and to be given an indication of the terms that would be acceptable to him We have no objection to the loan of an officer from the service of your Government but would like to know xrosh whether he has worked in Arab countries and if he can speak arabic.

Dear Cir Ceoffrev, I regret that it 4 has not been possible for me ' 9 to return an earlier reply to your letter of the 4th Hay last (written 'rorr Government House, Jerusalem), regarding the possibility of securing the loan of an officer to serve as an adviser to i s ne Sultan of liuscat. 2. I have purposely deferred my reply in the hope that contacts ’vhich. me have been having in the mean time with the Colonial Office over the prospects of administrative recruitment, and in particular of securing some part of the output of trie Arab centre here in Jerusalem, ibight prove fruitful, in vhicn case it is just possible that we might have been able to assist you in your present problem. 3. I fear, however, that we are stil 1 vithout ad ministrative re inforcements and without any immediate prospect of securing such reinforcements; and in these circumstances, seriously understaffed as me now are, I fear that much ns we should like to send an officer to the Persian Gulf we are quite unable to do so.

He is anxious to continue work in a field other thafc pure medical and I asked him if he would like to be considered as Adviser Muscat. He agreed and was enthusiastic. I was not in a position to discuss matter fully since Sultan has asked for British Adviser and Governments acceptance of a candidate is required. 2. There will probably be difficulty in obtaining British officer and in my view Attaullah’s medical qualifications, training in Europe, adminis trative experience gained in Persia, his knowledge of Arabic and his energy and disregard for personal comfort and climate make him an eminently suitable c candidate. He would be willing to serve for 5 half 10 years on approximately present emoluments. He can in my opinion be relied upon to work harmoniously with the Residency. 3. If you have no objection and Government of India know of none and could secure the necessary deputation I should like to put the proposal to the Sultan. - GALLOWAY - CONFIDENTIAL No. C/167.

I raised question with Sultan and found him very reluctant to employ Indian, who, he said, would meet with considerable difficulty at Muscat. I pointed out that Ataullah had experience with foreign governments and was pensionable government servant and not free lance. He finally accepted my proposal that he should see him without committing him self and will then, I think, probably accept. 3. Sultan says he is overwhelmed with details of administration and that he can make no progress till he gets assistance. This is true and in view of (a) diff iculty of finding reliable man (b) shortage of suitable political officers (c) importance of this area to India, I recommend that Ataullah be sent to Muscat as early as possible to contact Sultan on understanding that he will either be posted there on usual foreign service terms if found acceptable or placed on special duty for journey if appointment falls through. 4. If you agree please instruct Ataullah whose address is Dar-ul-Anwar, Qadian, Gurdaspur, to proceed to Muscat as early as possible and inform me by telegraph of action taken. ^d.

Political Agent, Muscat Political Resident, Bushire Your telegram No. 22/ dated 8 th Jebruar^. 2 # Sultan gave me his final decision yesterday not repeat not to accept Ataullah. After first interview he informed me that though liking Ataullah himself he could not feel that his appointment would be a success as public reaction especially from Shaikhs of Cman with whom he was now in contact would be very dnlavour- able. Moreover Ataullah, he said, had no experience of Arabs and was unable to speak Arabic. 1 ~ Impressed myself with Ataullah i endeavoured to allay his fears, suggesting appointment lor one year in iirst instance with tribal affairs excluded from his responsibilities until His Highness had seen more of him. After further inter views with Ataullah and discussions with me he finally stated that although he had oeen cautious in defining duties to be 0 ‘kpusigd to Adviser he wished for someone who would guide him in all the affairs of hie State and that while Ataulj.ah might be suitable for handling administrative and routine matters he would not entrust him with internal political matters or * even with finances. Most especially he wanted someone who would assist him in extention of his influence in interior which he was convinced Ataullah could not do. He would therefore prefer to w?it until British Officer became available. 5 . in snor^* (a) Sultan places reflected prestige which he considers British Ofhicer would give aim, particularly in tribal matters, above everything and (b) he is not prepared to try an experiment. 6 . Sultan reaffirmed his intention of remaining in Muscat next summer and hoped that by autumn his wishes would have been met. Political.Telegram. GTC From. Political Agent, Muscat To.

Both of 3 ound rather as if they might, like Bertram Thomas, devote their time to exploration and Miscellaneous 'ologies' and neglect the proper administration of the State. I think however it would be worth while arranging for the Sultan to 'vet' Thesiger at Salalah. If you agree would/kindly let the Sultan know aboutthis (not mentioning for the present his 'wanderlust') and if the Sultan agrees to interview him suggest dates within which he should present himself at Salalah. You should of course let the Sultan know that Thesiger cannot be made available for another year. 2 With regard to Thesiger's proposed journey this year I would suggest that you should let the Sultan know his plans and obtain his reactions. After that Thesiger could discuss details with the Sultan when they meet at Salalah. I presume the 'Wadi Bata at is the .adi Batha marked on the maps a short way south of Sur. 3 # if you and the Sultan agree that the latter should interview Thesiger at Salalah please telegraph the dates suggested. R.I. Hallows, Esquire, Political Agent, Muscat.India Office, y/hitehall, 3 .'./.l# Bv air Mail*- , „ „ HWL.'g r August 1946. My dear Kay, Yesterday a Hr. Wilfred Thesiger was s ent to see me about the kuscat Adviser job. Ue is * P iT‘-e the who servfea for six or seven years m the audan utio.e &gt;.he war, diu various jobs in the kiddle aast during tne war, w )3 employed as adviser to the Ethiopian government for a year but found that he aad no authority and no definite functions, so packed up, and is now with tne -olon Office's Anti-Locust Organisation for the kiddle -us,. Last year he went into the Hadramaut ana ea twaras into the area of the Riyadh Line, going as far as „.ugnsir. (Incidentally, he found quite a lot ox nomads north -1 the Riyadh Line who spoke with respect and afle-tion of the^aultan of Uuscat) . -hile he does not claim to be able to read or write arabio with any ease, ae na- some working knowledge of the oolloquial and in fact spent some several months in the back areas last year without an interpreter. Unfortunately, he is bound to the -oionial Office for anotner year and I have not i elt able to for his earlier release, partly because this would soaroely be possible in any case without the luitan s aooeptan-e of him and partly because he is going again this ooia weather to the Oman Hinterland up the Jadi data at ^1 am not absolutely certain where this kadi is, out pre-amaoiy it runs up from the Batain coast). It seems to me that it would be extremely valuable to trie Sultan to Lqwq K Thesiger to make this trip into an area where he - tne Sultan - is more than usually interested. 11 t ’° tiiem could meet before Thesiger moves off from trie coast there would be the dual advantage that the aul tan couia make his acquaintance and could ask him to pursue any particular enquiries that the Sultan wanted maue. i gather tnat Thesiger wants to start from Salaiah and work up the south coast in tne direction oi &gt;-»ur until^uc strikes the Wadi Bata’at, then turning inland. inesiger seems to think that the Sultan is rather opposea to tms plan and woulu prefer him to go in from our itself; out if the Sultan is going to'Salaiah in the ™ eeK oi October, which is just about the time tnat Thesiger wants to set off, you may think it worth while suggesting to the 3 ultan that he should invite fhesiger to meet him tiiere and let him go off oti the south coast line as ne propo ses. I was considerably impressed by Thesiger ana believe he will do very well indeed for the Sultan, provided the latter^ will wait for him. - really tmnx it is worth while waiting for the Sul tan would ge ^ an unusually good man. My only doubt is about nhesiger s willingness to sit down in Muscat and stay put. particularly asxed whether there would be any opportunity of journeys into the hinterland and 1 fear that if he had no opportunity of travelling around the back areas icom time to time he would become dissatisfied. But the Sultan may well think it worth while to encourage him. to maintain tne contacts which he made last year and will make this year, and I should imagine this particular difficulty could be overcome quite easily. Thesiger has no particular experience with finance but i bake it that tne overhaul of the Muscat finances is less a matter of rules and forms than of evolving some commonsense simple method of ensuring fair recoveries and reasonably honest «iys of spending proceods^ ^ ^M.

It was good of you to think of me. It was a job I should have been delighted to accept, for it would have been extremely interesting 5 but my wife thinks we left the elder children too long in the war and wants to have the youngest with her all the time and the elder daughter in the vacations^, so she persuaded me to take an oil job in Aleppo, where ■ the better climate makes these schemes possible.

During an interview I had with the Sultan on March 10th, 1 asked him whether he would bo agreeable to a candidate without a knowledge of Arabic, and explained that we were experiencing some difficulty in finding a suitable person who already knew the language. He replied insisting that a knowledge of Arabic was absolutely essential, I then tcld him that the Commonwealth Relations Office was trying to get in touch v.ith Colonei Northfield and said we would let him know the result in due course. The Sultan urged the necessity of getting somebody soon, and said that he was moot unhappy about the present position where he had nobody he could rely on to control the administration and see that his orders were carried out, or even suggest to him improvements in the administration. At the moment, he said, all ideas had to come from him personally and even then he could not rely on his officials to put them into execution efficiently. He did not mention anything about Major Fforde and I did not stress the matter at this meeting. 3* Failing Northfield I do hope the Cornmonwealth Relations Office will be able to find another candidate soon, otherwise I fear the Sultan may produce his own candidate. One possibility is a Palestinian named Nadir al Dujain, brother in law of Rassassi the Chief Wali, who arrived in / Muscat The Honourable Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.Muscat ostensibly on a visit to Rassassi a few days a^o. I have not yet met him myself but understand he is very presentable and has done three years at Cambridge studying law, and makes no bones about admitting that if he can get employment in Muscat he will accept.—- -■ajar Fforde Regarding Major Fforde, the Sultan said that he had at no tine contemplated employing Major Fforde as Minister of External Affairs, although it had lately been apparent that that was what he wanted. He had, however, told Major Fforde that after his return to Muscat he would see if there was any other post in which he may require his services. He had finally come to the conclusion that he had no vacancy for lifejor Fforde in his employment and was writing to Major Fforde to tell him so* ltd.

HARRISON, 3S4,.Colonial Office, 1st July, With reference to your enquiry (your reference rixt#3545/46) abjut finding a British Adviser for the Sultan of 1 uscat, I send herewith particulars of Mr. W.H. Ingrams, C.h.C., about wiiojn I spoke to you. Ingrams was born in 1397 and educated at Shrewsbury where he had a Classical Scholarship, After war service from 1914-1919 he was e^poinsed Administrative Officer in ianaibar and served there until 1927 when he went to Mauritius as assistant Colonial Secretary. In 1934 he was promoted Political Officer, Aden, and in 1937 Resident adviser to the h&amp;thiri Sultan and Resident Adviser to the Sultan of Uukalla. He served in this post with a short interval during which lie was Chief Secretary, Aden, until last year when he was seconded to the Control Commission, Germany. His year with the Control Commission expires in-July and he is anxious to return to overseas service. He feels as we do that he has been long enough in his present appointment but we have not at the moment apy vacancy in which we could make suitable use of his rather special qualifications. He has published numerous books and papers, the most important of which are * Zanzibar. Its History and Its People* (1930), 'Report on Social, Kconaaic and Political Conditions of the Hadhramaut* (1937) and 'Arabia and the Isles* (1942). He has had considerable experience of negotiating treaties and agreements with Sultans and Chiefs in the Ad6n Protectorate and with the Yemeni Government. In the iiadhrawaut he started every Government '*5 activity and built up a complete Government organization from ‘ practically nothing, as well as placing the States on a sound financial basis and establishing education, health and police services. I should add that in all this work he lias been most ably helped ty Mrs. Ingrams who has herself done excellent work amongst the Arab women. /If 3.P.

General speaking, I think that Northfield v/ould be suited for a post suoh as that described in your letter but I have no information about the state of his health. I am sure that, as you say, Mrs. Northfield would be a gre it asset. Northfield has one fault and that is restlessness. He seems unable to settle down in aqy particular post or at ary special work.

I enclose herewith an extract of a letter I have received from Burrows on this subject. 3 . I have hitherto been opposed to the appointment of a Ingrams because I considered he was rather too big and senior/raan for the job and also that he would be likely to spend too much of his time in collecting materials for the writing of books. He spent many years at Mukallah and is probably .well known to the Sultan by reputation. If therefore the Sultan does not wish to accept Howes would you kindly ask him whether he would be willing to consider Ingrams. 4. Stewart and I discussed the possibility of Tod’s appointment with the Sultan and we qame to the conclusion that he probably does not possess sufficient personality. As you probably know he is the 'Commanding Officer of the 'Loch Glendhu'. If, however, the Sultan is willing to consider him further I am inclined to prefer him to Ingrams.mmW '— EXTRACT FROM MR. B.A.B. BURROWS’ LETTER No.(E 4979/ 91) DATED THE 16TH JUNE 1948) Regarding an adviser for Muscat. We are in touch with J.B. Howes about this appointment and the present position is that while definitely interested he has referred to his wife, who is in Australia, before making any final decision. We will let you know the result in due course. Failing Howes, the only other candidates for this post are W.H. Ingrams and Tod, who we understand wrote to Stewarfi when~'he was in Muscat asking to be considered for the appointment.

I had a long talk with the Sultan about this matter on the 6th July. He was unwilling to _ accept either Howes or Ingrams for the appointment, apparently on personal grounds. He s»id that he had originally asked for either a Foreign Service or an Indian Political Service man out as the latter service was defunct he had dropped his request for a man from it. I told him that it would bo difficult, if not impossible, to spare a suitable man from the Foreign Service. He went on to say that before anybody else, he would like to employ either Hickinbotham or Jackson. I told him that the latter could not be spared and that I had previously sounded Hickinbotham, who is at present employed as Chairman of the Port Trust at Aden, without success. It was, however, agreed that both the Sultan and I should write to Hickinbotham personal ly to see whether there was any chance of his being willing to come to Muscat when his present appointment terminates. The Sultan gave me a letter &gt;'hich 1 am posting to Hickinbotham, and I am also writing to him myself and will let you Know the result* V 3. The Suit,an finally agreed that he would accept a suitable ex-Indian Political Service Officer even if he had no previous experience of the Gulf, provided he was willing to learn Arabic after coming to ^uscat. He would of course wish to interview him first. If, there fore, Hickinbotham fails us, as I think he probably will, I suggest that we try to find sane suitable ex-Indian Political Service or ex-Indian Civil Service man, without insisting on a knowledge of Arabic or previous experience of the Middle &lt;sast. I am rather anxious to keep Woods- Ballard in reserve for the Kuwait appointment, hut If he is not willing ~to wait, and is ready to'accept the Muscat appointment, I think we should try to procure his services for it rather than lose him altogether. Other wise I should be inclined to prefer somebody younger than Woods-Ballard or Herrington-Hawes. 4# . I told the Sultan that in view of the increase in cost of living and the lack of amenities in Muscat, I did not think any officer would now be willing to accept as low a salary as Hs. 2,000. The Sultan raised no objection and it was agreed that the question of pay should be left for discussion when a suitable candidate has been found.— CONFIDEWTIAI No.M/83 (35/138) PERSIAN GTTXF' RFSTD^’^CV BAHRAIN the 14th July 1948 - Please refer to^/Correspondence ending with my Printed Letter No.C/59 of the 8th July 1948 regarding a Minister of Foreign Affairs for Muscat. 2.

Would you kindly do what you can to assist on the lines indicated in my reply? tNo.8 Broad Oak, Crawley Down, Sussex. Dear Rupert, 3rd Movemoer '48. Thank you for your letter 182/5/48 of the 23rd October, 1948. \ 2. I am already in touch with Charles Kendall and have written to Gellatley Hankey and Keymer Son and Co., asking i for their terms, after»which I shall interview them. All three firms have been asked whether they can supply the equipment required for the Muscat Infantry and to quote cost totals for (a) the goods and (b) packing and freight; also ^to let me have an approximate uate for delivery at Muscat. r VrV- V*' 3. The Sultan asked me to see about two 12 K.W. generating sets ordered through the India Stores Department. I have seen the man who deals with the case and he is writing to the contracting firm, Ruston Hornsby and Co., in an effort to expedite' delivery which, last May, was put off until the end of 1949 or sometime in 1950. It seems the only way to get satisfaction, if this possible, is by personal contact with the firm so I have decided to go up to Lincoln in the near future to see them about it. The India Stores Department's letter will also introduce me Rustons. Ruston Hornsby are the main contractors and are supplying the engines while Crompton Parkinson are doing the purely electrical side. It may be necessary to go and see them at Chelmsford. 4. I have asked the Sultan to place £100/- to my credit to cover the miscellaneous expenditure connected with the work I am doing here on behalf of the State and it is hoped that he will agree to it in the near future. &amp; detailed expense account will ofcourse be kept. I wrote to him regarding this expense account when I was in Bahrain and there should be no difficulty as he agreed to it in principle when I was in Muscat. 5. You may remember I discussed the Sur and other water supply schemes with you when I was staying at the Residency. I also wrote to the Sultan about them on the line we agreed would be the best. This, briefly, was that Holloway Brothers should themselves get out the estimates, cutting out' the proposed consulting engineer. I enclose a copy of my letter on the subject and am anxious that the Sultan should authorise me to go ahead. 6. I am also anxious to obtain details of construction steel which the Sultan requires for building purposes. T 7. Wireless equipment. The Sultan has a long letter from me J on this subject. Cable and Wirelass say he must get new 1 K.W. sets if he wants communication between Dhofar and Muscat, and - have suitable personnel properly trained. r 8. Then there is the question of living accommodation for me It in Muscat. The proposals I put forward from Bahrain were that instead of the whole house, at present allotted to the Bank, being ^ given to me, they should be allowed to stay and certain rooms taken over from them and put at my disposal. My object in this was threefold: (1) to avoid putting the Bank to trouble as they might find it difficult to get suitable alternative accommodation at short notice, (2) to overcome the electric light difficulty I for the Bank and, (3) to save the State expense, all I want is l one bedroomed flat which would take up the north and east sides of the first floor ”' 'i .—■■■■of the first floor of the house. But I have asked for the accommodation to be put in good condition;- (a) water to be laid on by means of a pump from the main which passes in the road below the house, (b) the bathroom to be modernised with septic tank sanitation and (c) one. room to be air-conditioned. In this connection it is essential that the Bank should not remove the electric wiring put in by them but that it should be replaced in kind by the State. Of course it would cost a certain amount of money to do all this but it would be spent on the improvement of State property and so would be in the nature of capital investment. 9. I am trying to obtain estimates for some simple furniture and the other items necessary to make the premises habitable but its a slow business and I would like the Sultan to agree in principle to what I have proposed. I would not mind what the accommodation conditions were like if Muscat had a reasonable climate but as it is, I feel that if I am to give the Sultan what I am so anxious to give him, good service, it is essential that I should preserve my health. 10. I do hope you will forgive me for bringing you in on these various matters but you will be visiting Muscat sometime this month when the opportunity of expediting them may present itself. If you can help in any way, I should be most grateful; but I shall of course understand if you feel that I am asking too much. Yours ever, B ‘ His Excellency' • Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resiaent, The Residency, Bahrain. (TRUE COPY). , 1 (TRUE COPY).No. 7 Bahrain. 12th October 1948. Subject: - SUR iiND OTHER V.aTSR SUPPLY SCHEMES Your Highness, I have discussed these projects with Sir Rupert Hay and also contacted Mr. Partridge, the local representative of Holloway Brothers. The firm's latest proposals include a visit from an independent consulting engineer accompanied by an engineer belonging to the firm, a rough estimate of the cost of obtaining schemes and estimates for Muscat, Matrah and Sur on this basis would be in the neighbourhood of £2,000, which is much too much. I have suggested that the sites should be visited at the expense of the State by a man from Holloway Brothers only, who should in the first instance, make a survey of each scheme. In the event of survey proving a scheme to be practicable, he would then proceed to get out plans and estimates for it, which would become the property of the State, on which the State couldcall for tenuers. Sir Rupert Hay entirely agrees with me, and as soon as I get home, I shall go and see the head of Holloway Brothers and try to persuade him to cut out the consulting engineer. This should reduce costs from half to two thirds. I have said that whoever comes to Muscat for the purpose of examining these projects will be treated as a State guest while he is there, and have free transport placed at his disposal. Of course before he ever comes to Muscat the firm will submit a rough estimate of the cost of the visit and the work. It will then be for Your Highness to accept or to reject the offer. Would you kindly let me know whether you approve of the lines on which I am working. . I am, Your Highness 1 obedient servant, His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Muscat. (True Copy):(182/7/48) PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY BAHRAIN, 15th November, 1S48. &gt; M^ny thanks for your letter No,8 of the 3rd November. With refererce to the question of a purchasing agent, the Sultan wants you to consult him before making a decision, but I think you have already been asked to do this. With regard to the various water supply schemes, I have spoken to Reed, who is the head of Holloway's in these parts, and he is strongly of the opinion that the site should be examined by a consulting engineer who is a geological expert. Ills proposal is that such an expert should visit the site accompanied by a Junior member of his firm. I'am inclined to think that he is right to a certain extent as it is essential to know if the water is there, and can be brought to the place where it is required before any schemes are elaborated. He did not like the suggestion that to save money, the expert should visit £he site without a representative from his firm. In any case, the expert he would recommend is Beeby Thompson. You can probably find his address in the London Telephone directory if you want to have a talk with him. His son is employed by the Bahrain Government as an oil gauger. * I am sending a copy of your letter to Ellison and asking him to look into the various points you discussed, especially that of your acconmodation. I am also going to Muscat myself later in the month and will do what lean to assist. B.

The file begins with details of a request from the Sultan to appoint an officer (preferably British) as Minister for Foreign Affairs, with the possibility of the officer also being required to act as financial adviser. The correspondence documents British efforts over the course of three years to recruit a suitable officer. It includes discussion of potential candidates, as well as related matters such as the terms of employment for the position and the difficulty of finding a suitable British candidate with some knowledge of Arabic. Candidates considered for the role include a British Indian officer named Lieutenant-Colonel Mohamed Ataullah, and numerous British officials such as William Harold Ingrams, Colonel Valentine Hugh Wilfred Dowson, and the explorer Wilfred Thesiger. An appointment was eventually made in October 1948, with Lieutenant-Colonel Basil Woods Ballard accepting the position.Notable correspondents include the following: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Sultan of Muscat and Oman; officials of the Government of India's External Affairs Department, the India Office, the Commonwealth Relations Office, the Foreign Office, and the Colonial Office.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Basil Woods Ballard</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Minister for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commonwealth Relations Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Wilfred Patrick Thesiger</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Valentine Hugh Wilfred Dowson</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Conditions of employment</topic></subject><subject><topic>Recruitment</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000033#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
