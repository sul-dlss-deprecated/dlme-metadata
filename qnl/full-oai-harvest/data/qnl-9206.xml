The papers record the progress of the dispute, and the intervention of British officials. The dispute was eventually settled and the camels returned.There is a sketch map of the disputed area on folio 28.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Khor Ghanadah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>border disputes</topic></subject><subject><topic>Camels</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00018c#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00018c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
