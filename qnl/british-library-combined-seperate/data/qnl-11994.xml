This includes a discussion of the Sultan's financial arrangements, his preference to reside in Dhofar rather than Muscat, his political intentions and general attitude towards the British.Most of the correspondence in the file is between the Political Agency in Muscat and the Political Residency in Bushire. However, on folios 11-19, the file contains correspondence between Captain Tom Hickinbotham, Britain's Political Agent and Consul in Muscat, and William Harold Ingrams, the Resident Adviser in Mukalla, regarding the increase in influence of the Sultan in the interior of Muscat and Oman and a general assessment of the political structure of the Sultanate.The file also contains a report on the political situation in Muscat and Oman written by Hickinbotham (folios 3-10).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Resident Adviser</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000a4#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
