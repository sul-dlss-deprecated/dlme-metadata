The’Security Deposit Accounts and Miscellaneous Accounts do not appear to.be consonant with the fundamen tal object of the Post Office Savings Banks., which is to provide a ready means-for'.'the deposit of savings and to encourage thrift. The .rules provide that the lost Oj-fice Savings Banks are not to be used for the purpose of keeping current accounts and yet many accounts of the kind mention ed above are essentially current accounts. The Govern- opening 1 of such accounts In the past when banking and other facilities in the country had not developed, there the' question of the desirability of regaining the Security is- 2 - ' «■ . .. f t is little or no justification for their continuance ‘ now. They are expensive to Government to maintain and provide facilities, the need for which cannot be said to be real a.t the present moment. 3. A.s regards the Teachers’ Provident Accounts, their maintenance in the Post Office Savings Banks ensures perfect accounting without any cost to the institutions, and removes chances of frauds. As the deposits in such accounts are usually small.Government do not secure, by the ..use of this money, savings sufficient to justify their maintenance. 4. The Government of India have also considered tile question whether some reduction is not justified in the rate of interest allowed on Regimental, Police and other Conjoint accounts, opened under Rule 44 of the Post Office Savings Bank Rules. Such accounts afford special facilities to the .depositors and work more or less as current accounts. Commercial Banks do not normally allow any interest in-the case of current accounts and the Government of India consider that the rate of interest in respect of such accounts should be fixed at below the ordinary rate. 5. Before, however, taxing final decisions, the Government of India will be glad to have the views of the Government of Bombay on the questions raised in etc. paragraphs 1 and 2 above, by the 15th April 1940.
