Hennell reports that these forces then marched upon Chakoota, which was evacuated by the Tungistoonees [TangestƒÅnis] and restored to Sheik Nasir's dependents. Hennell goes on to describe Bakir Khan's reaction to these events and Mahomed Kurreem Khan's return to Shiraz. Hennell encloses a translated substance of reports made by the Agent at Shiraz regarding occurrences in the province of Fars between 1 March and 4 April 1850.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x000021#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
