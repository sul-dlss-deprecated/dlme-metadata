(a)(l)Mr.f.Meinel of Buren, and Go. of Basra visited Kuwait on the 5th December, returning the next day. He was accompanied by Herr Kopp, a German engineer employed by his firm and whom he intended to leave here indefinitely as its agent and as resident engineer of the Kuwait lectric Light Company which has a German engine sold to it by Buren and Company. Messrs: *&gt;uren and Company are desirous of installing an internal telephone system and aanu a ysrci in ^iich Co x*ivot togother Gerraan ri/er barges for sale in Iraq end rarsia. Mr.Meinel said that the reason for doing mis latter work here was that Kuwait la hour would be, Tor tils our os o, superior to Iraqi. he can have no experience of Kuwaiti labour this seemed an unlikely story and it was subsequently coat, irmed that in reality he intended tc import Iraqi rivetters. It axso apoears mat the real motive for wishing to assemble the barges hare is to evade some restrictions on import direct, by importing the barges into Iraq or Persia via Kuwait through a third party, a Kuwaiti called Yusif al Ghanim who was approached by him. Incidentally xeinel stated that his firm had desired to import British barges to Iraq but the British Stride Line had refused to carry them whereas the Hansa Line steamers carried then in two parte readily. According to ?tr.M©iasl f s somewhat evasive replies his fLr.i is an unregistered ana private British one, since Mr.. uren, an elderly man liviiiq in ;ngland, is now in possession of British nationality, although he came originally from the Hhineland whither his ancestors emigrated from France with the Huguenots. This is not quite correct as Suren and Co.Ltd. of Basra, by whom he is employed is registered in Baghdad as an Iraqi firm having an Armenian Manager and partner, iir.Assays, and from all other accounts Mr.Luran is a Kussian .Tew from Hamburg. Mr.Leinel is in possession of a British passport in spite of his German sounding name and pro-German sympathies and his firm is an enterprising Anglo-German concern, trading mostly in German material and employing Berrsan or Anglo- German super! oi 1 labour. (2) The attention of the Comptroller of the Department of Overseas Trade and the i-irector General of Commercial Intelligence, Calcutta, has been drawn to the apparentapparent opportunity for the sale hare of a telephone system ana other suitable official action ht s been taken. Herr Kopp, it has been arranged, will be returning to dasra as soon as the electric light engine is working satisfactorily - in say three raonths time. Mr.lileinel travelled to Kuweit with Mr.Dent, Co- Manager of the Ottoiaan nank at nasra with wh(Ma he has avowedly very special and close relations. (b) Dr.Hichard Peters, a German, and his 'Secretary', ?rau Marie Postl, an Austrian woraan, and an Iraqi servant Hamid ^asoon arrived on the 12th December. Dr.Peters is an Opthaimic burgeon, whose headquarters is in Baghdad and W ho visited Kuwait for medical work for a few months in 193D. He has applied to the Residency to visit the Truci&amp;l Coast. Prau Postl*s passport is ho.2589 dated Cairo, the 5th November 19 29. Dr.Peter’s passport is Ho.2l/D5 issued at Baghdad on 1.11.25. is previous passport is ho.10,issued in Cairo in November 1920. They appear to trey el much too much for an ordinary Opthalmio surgeon and in the last 2 years have crossed and. e recrobsed most of the countries of the Middle fast and fiddle and oouth-Dast Morope. 177.BAKKIi^G CoTS. Mr.Dent of the Ottoman Bank arrived here on 6th December travelling with Mr.meinel (Mee para 176 above). His object was to obtain permission to open a bank here and he was interviewed by the xvuler on the subject. Philip Bashuri, whom Mr.Dent spoke of to the Political ^gont as the man his Bank would probably install as local Manager may be the same man who applied in September from Khorramshahr for permission to import Japanese and German $oode into Bahrain.

He stayed with the Ruler whose representative met him and saw him off beyond the walls at the customary points in the desert. The Ruler gave a small dinner party for him which was attended by the Political Agent, who also met him on his way in and saw him off on his way out of Kuwait. Before leaving Haji al Asil gave to the Ruler a small gold watch inscribed as a present from H.M.King Ghazi. It may perhaps be worth recording that he had left here wearing Iraqi dress, a suit and 'Sidara' cap but returned wearing Arab head-dress and cloak and told the Political Agent that the King of Laudi Arabia had made some remarks about Foreigi diplomats necessarily wearing Arab clothes in Central Arabia and that he had excused himself on the ground of haste in departure. 16 6. R ELATION3 ,;ITH ^aDDI ARABIA. ( i) Aftermath of the Revolt In ^abla. The Ataiba Re^uees. (1) Ibn Laud has since his general amnesty to Political refugees last year been accepting their returns on terms favourable to the refugges. During the last year nearly all the tribal refugees, Shaikhs of the Ajman and Mutair and their clansmen, have now returned from Iraq passing in most cases through Kuwait. (2) There had remained Naif Ibn Hums id . Paramount Shaikh of the Ataibe and Shaikh in particular of the Burqa division of that tribe together with his clansmen amongamong whom the best known are (a) Muhammad al Khidhri , Shaikh of the al Da f ajin section of the Ataiba, (b) Sallal Ibn Hijna, a Shaikh of the ANFA section of the Ataiba, (c) Mijad al Daihna, a Shaikh of the Al Musaid section of the Ataiba, (d) Shafi ash Shuraicha, a raid leader, (AQJD) of the Al MUQQTTA division of the Ataiba. (c) and (d) have both just gone over to Ibn Saud and Shaikh Naif e Ibn Humaid himself recently received an invitation from Ibn Saud to go over too and was promised a oar from Kuwait to Riyadh. It is however reported in Kuwait that in the last few weeks, since the coup d’etat, His Majesty the King of Iraq has increased the monthly allotments to the remaining tribal and Hejazi refugees; allotments which had been steadily cut down since the late King Faisal’s death. Naif, as his allotment has been increased, is therefore doubtful about leaving Iraq. He was recently camped at Rutba wells and it is reported that he is in his customary way about to move into the Al .ifudain (Iraq -Saudi Arabia frontier) after the rains and in the company, as usual, of Abdul Muhsin al Daghaim and Sahan Ibn Hadhal, Shaikhs of the Anaiza leading family. Note. Naif Ibn Hums id as the paramount Shaikh of the Ataiba and by character is with the possible exception of the rather colourless young Emir Muhammad ibn Abdul Muhsin Ibn Rashid of Hail the most important politically of the remaining refugees in Iraq. The Ataiba are the largest tribe in Arabia and Naif is a chieftaii of courage and ability, whotas probably benefited by the opportunity of new contacts outside Arabia proper during his exile. His present ageage is 30. If as seems probable the above report is correct and an increased allotment has enabled him to stay in Iraq it will not be pleasing to Ibn 3aud. (lij On the 30th November, Naif Ibn Obaid al Mutlaggim arrived from his camp in the Suaman for an annual visit to the Shaikhly family of Kuwait. His father was a Kuwaiti and one of the companions of Ibn tiaud at his capture of Riyadh in 1901. 167. TRI BaL LOC^'ii Ulia. Tribal locations are normal for the season. 368.METEOROLOGICAL.

They are the leading merchants of Kuwait, On the 7th this committee issued invitations signed by all its members calling the other merchants and notables of the town to a meeting at the Mubarakiya School on the Qth October to open subscriptions for the help of their brethren, the people of Palestine. About one hundred and fifty persons were present. The Ciadhi and Mudir al Awqaf, Shaikh Abdul Aziz bin Hamada, opened the meeting with a few words, and was followed by Shaikh Ahmad al-Khamis, who delivered an impassioned speech which drew tears from the eyes of many present. Contributions then started with a donation from Shaha daughter of Hamad as-Saor, of her building composed of a godown and an office at the Manakh section of bazaar, which were bought by her brother Abdulla for Hs.2500/-. All the merchants gave liberally, and a sum of Rs*7500/- was raised. [ Lottery tickets from Iraq for the assistance of the people of Palestine were sold in Kuwait. 200 tickets of 100 fils were sold out, and 200 more were ordered by telegram. The money subscribed had not yet been sent when the radio informed Kuwait that the strike was coming to an end. The next day there were some very sheepish faces among the enthusiasts for the Palestinian Cause and congratulations were widely exchanged that the money had not left Kuwait. The purpose to which it could be best devoted is now a matter for debate but the most popular solution is that it should be placed in a Bombay bank on deposit against another very rany day like that which destroyed a quarter ‘r .*--.' . , mdestroyed a quarter of the torn in the 137 .AFGHAN II'iTBHBSTfi. winter of 1934.

No moves from the permanent wells have taken place yet but most chiefs contemplate moving e rather earlier than usual this year and will probably give the order to saddle up between the 10th and 20th of October. All- 4 - All sections are busy restocking from Kuwait. Sections of the Ne j d AWAZBI and some of the are camped in Kuwait territory for trading purposes, Ibn Saud having permitted it. The majority of the AWAZBi' under Ibn DURAI are camped at al Tawil with others and at as Subaihi and Subaihiya prepared,as soon as their trading is completed,to move towards the SHAQQ on the Kuwait-Saudi Arab frontier. A number of other individuals and minor sections have been permitted to trade* 1 24.Palestine disturbances. (a) A telegram from Amin al Hussaini, the Mufti of Jerusalem and President of the Supreme Moslem Council was received by the Ruler on the 14 th Sept saber* It enquired if His Excellency was still disposed towards mediation and informed him that his name had been mentioned as being so in a declaration by the Council intended as a reply to the Hi^i Commissioner *3 published statement of the 7th September. as Excellency replied politely in non-committal sense. v 1 , - riba 1 feeling remains little disturbed. It is not known by the Bedouins here to what tribes the Palestinian Arabs belong and therefore they cannot be recog nized as traditionally friend or foe, as noble or ignoble. Moreover the long summer pause on the permanent wells xorbids movement of camps until about now and individual travellers are few* From now onwards information about and interest m the trend of affairs in Palestine may be expected to increase. is Among townsmen there/already much strong feeling and their sympathy is of course with the Arabs of Palestine although that country being so far away their interest i sinterest is academic. Reports in Arabic newspapers and verbally from Iraq that FAWZI QAV'fUKCHI, an Officer of the Iraq army, with a number of other officers and non commissioned officers of the Iraq army and weapons had left for Palestine caused much astonishment and discussion. (c) Radio broadcasts from Italy, Prance and Germany m Arabic are frequent and sometimes in the case of Italy extremely strong in political tone. The Ruler on the iSth September and others among the notables at various times mentioned in private conversation how much they regret that Great Britain does not issue a broadcast in Arabic designed to counter mischievously intended forelgp broadcasts• Id) The Saudi Arab Commercial Agent in private convers ation at the Agency on the 17th gave it as his view that matters were becoming extremly grave in Palestine and ttiat as a result -eS semi-religious twist would be given to the affair widening again its field of reaction, which already in his opinion included the whole Arab world. He concluded by saying that 'Britain was about to fi^it a reasonable neighbour and friend for the sake of an untrustworthy servant'. He repeated much the same thing on the following days to others. It is rather unusual for him to be so forcible in conversation, and on political subjects on wmeh he usually pleads ignorance. It nmy therefore be inspired by coiumunications frcm Riyadh. (a) The quotation by Saut al Ahrar of a recent date, as it alleged, of the Daily Mail, giving British casualties on the North-West frontier of India in a rising of the tribes near the Khyber Pass in sympathy with the Arabis of Palestine as over a thousand dead was much discussed, and generally believed by the townaaen. The Agency took steps to let it be known as quite untrue. ( f) The news on the 23rd of the arrival of the 1stOf the 1 st Division in Palestine has in Kuwait had an excellent effect as it was beginning to be suspected that the suggestion of Britainn decline and inability so harped upon by foreign Arabicnewspapers and some European broadcadiers might be true* COMIEKT. Unfortunately the rapid military crushing of the rebel bands is also momentarily anticipated ani if this does not occur soon and in the absence of any explanations, conclusions unfavourable to British strength and resource fulness may be drawn. 125.

A report on each case has been forwarded to the Hon’ble the Political Resident* 126.RELATIONS TLTR SAUDI ARABIA* (a) Reports in the beginning of August indicated that the King was devoting unusual attention to frontier affairs* Later, the Ruler received a letter from His Majesty in very friendly terms informing him of an intended tour in Qasim and the North* At the end of September it was reported that he was leaving Riyadh on September 28th f for Anaiza, Buraida and Hail and that His Majesty’s party, which included many sons and relations but excluded theCy\~ 0 Ouky. excluded the Emir Saud, the *mmm Prince, who remains in Riyadh, was travelling in 167 motor cars with a supply train including 10000 gallons of petrol. It is locally supposed that His Majesty with his usual political acumen is 'calming his fanatical tribesmen' to the English, 'marching on Palestine' to the Arabs and in reality mostly engaged in hunting, marrying and practical joking; and if perhaps a few of the younger bloods go for a foray in Palestine His Majesty will no doubt know nothing of it* (b) A new frontiar post was established at Lina about the beginning of August and Abdulla bin Saiyid, one of Bin Saud 1 s ♦negroes’ was put in charge of it* Early in August Ibn Arfaj was instructed to relive bin Amar as the official in charge of the Hafar post, and Ibn Muhasib put in charge of Um ar Radhuma post. Stricter vigilance was enjoined upon all frontier officials. (c) To enthusiastic offers from certain of his tribesmen to 'help their brethren in Palestine in their hour of need', Bin Saud is in local report said to have replied that he, conjointly with the Imam of Yemen and King Ghazi , had sent an appeal to H.M.King Edward appealing for a satisfactory settlement of the Palestinian question and was awaiting the result till when no move should be made. (d) Mohammad ibn Abdul Aziz al Apafa, brother of Saud al Arafa, cousin and brother-in-law of the King, arrived at Kuwait on the 15th August acccmpanied by al- Ruba’i, a member of Bin Saud’s retinue, in order to attend the local ^unerican Mission Hospital. He and his party were put up in a house provided for them by the Shaikh of Kuwait. On 2nd September finding no relief frcm his ail- ment, Mohammad al Arafa left for Baghdad to have himselfhimself X-Rayed at the Hospital there. (e) An incident, related to one which had occurred last year between some men of the Arif section of the Dhafir tribe of Iraq and a camel section of Iraq Preventive Police, ln 'Mch the latter were destroyed to the last n*n by the tribesmen, took place during the period under review. It appears that the Iraqi Government has been in search of the clprits ever since the occurrence. Bedouin reports relate that on receiving infonaation sometime ago that the men concerned were camped with AJIMI al Suwait i B ■ Au Quba district (Saudi Arabia) Iraqi Police arrsd cars ' proceeded there with the prior permission of the King in order to make a search of AJimi’s camp for the wanted men Ajimi al Suwait and his men are s 8 id to have refused to let the Police carry out the search of their Camp. The leader of the Police force then got in wireless touch with _ the frontier official at Ar Radhumma, in turn consulted (j with Bin Musa*ad, Governor of Hail (also over the wireless) who decided that the search should be permitted, detailing Mohamed bin Qahtani to assist the Iraqi Police, who haa meanwhile reinforced themselves with several other armed cars. Unfortunately after all this when the search was proceeded with not one of the wanted batch was found among the bedouins in camp at Au Quba. Having failed in the main object of the expedition tHe reader of the Police is then reported to have tried, with promises of a subsidy and amenities to persuade Ajimi, Ja’ali bin Jariad and some other leaders of note to come over to Iraq territory and live ther^ Wo m + 4 4 -t. j i.u xAve -cnere.

(a) Inspite of the Ruler’s forbidding public subscriptions to the Arab fund for continuance of the campaign in Palestine, some money from Kuwait has been * subscribed through the influence of Iraq, where the Basra •4 newspaper’an Nas’ has charged itself with collecting Kuwait subscriptions. It has announced the collection of I.D.200 from Kuwait. The actual amount is believed to be considerably less, in fact to be very small indeed. (b) No bedouin movements here or in North Saudi Arabia are likely for the moment, in the great summer heat; but it is locally estimated that if the present affair continued into the Autumn there would be a tendency to move towards Palestine of at least the younger fighting men from northern Nejd and the Hejaz 104. RELATIONS ,ITH SAUDI ARABIA. (a) .Frontier Post at Ha far al Batin. The construction of the post at Hafar al Batin (para 94(b) of Summary No. 10) has begun and the foundations are complete. The ground plan is not extensive being only about 40 ft. by 60 ft. (b)- 4 - (b) Annual Tribute. The annual mass visit of the chieftains of Nejd to Ibn Saud which usually takes place in the early part of July took place earlier this year; in the latter half of June. rhe chieftains were too unusually called in by let ter and ordered to bring their best followers with them. None has yet returned to North-East Arabia. (c) Annual Tribute (Later). Later information from arrivals from Riyadh is that the Shaikhs of North-Sast Arabia who attended the annual Feudal Levy, payment of tributes and distribution of bounty by the King found the King particularly winning. They were all addressed in the same way in one respect. His Majesty said to each: 'TABAYYINLI AT TAYYIBIN - JiXLSIHI YASBDD AL LOWAZIM', that is nearly rt MAKS KNCl^N TO MJS YOUR TRUSTY ONES - THOSE WHO ARE EFFICIENT^. His Majesty also gave larger bounties than last year. Rumours consequent on the above are current that something unusual is about to happen. Borne say there is to be a campaign against the Yemen, others that *our brothers who are being killed by the Jews in Palestine (!?)* are to be avenged. It seems not unlikely that Ibn Baud is merely, in a world that must seem to him increasingly unsteady, tak ing care to maintain his hold over his people; stimulating by the means described loyalty and self-interest among his fickle but warlike Nejdi subjects. Guarding too, he probably is, against the consequences of a continuance of the Palestine affair into the Autumn which would then, movement being possible once/on the 24th June. xhe following arrived in Kuwait from Basra on the 29th and left the same day;- oaiyid Hamad an Naqib, ?ord ^ent, Kuwait. 2. *.mdes, Ford mgent for Basra. 3.

The average crew numbers thirty five and the navigator-helmsman and master of the crew receive four and three shares respectively, the owner taking half the total clear profit. The total cash brought into Kuwait for the year from this source is therefore about Rs. 1 , 000 , 000 . (c) Boat-building* An unexpectedly large number of orders have \ been received at this the beginning of the boat-building season, which necessarily coincides with the return of the carrying vessels which on their last and homeward journey carry wood frcm the Malabar Coast. This is accounted for partly by the general improvement in the carrying trade thi past season and partly by the increase in foreign orders for boat-building in Kuwait, an increase which has been maintained for the last three years. 81. OIL II'JTNRESTB. (a) Personnel. The following two more drillers arrived at Kuwait during the period under review to take up appointments with the Kuwait Oil Company. Both are British subjects: (1) Mr.J.K.tfalconer, (E) Mr.D.Robinson.Lb) Qg-ej^ing Kuwait Oil Company^ First 'Yell &gt; The Ruler at the request of the Local Manager of the Kuwait Oil Company having agreed to a formal opening of their boring operations, arrangements were made for His Excellency to come to Bahrah, the site of the well, on the 30th May there to start the rig working in the presence of the Notables and Europeans. The hour chosen for the reception, the first of its kind in Kuwait territory, was 4,30 P.M. and the day falling as it did in the 'Barih ath-Thuraiya' period of warm and strongish winds, the start from Kuwait at 1.30 P.M. for the 100 or so guests was a hot one. Nevertheless at that hour all the Kuwait cars most of them very fully laden with the Notables and their followers, set out at racing pace into the dust haze. Strangely there were no casualties reported but many of the guests arrived an hour before the time for which they were invited. ^ Meanwhile the Company found the weather had destroyed its l arrangements. The flapping dust-filled tents were quite unsuitable as places of reception and were abandoned in favour of the garage. To a very crowded audience only slightly revived by Sherbet, the Manager delivered his address and His Excellency through his Secretary briefly replied before the rush by car to the derrick began. There the Ruler at 5 P.M. on the 30th May 1936 by pressing an electric button had the gratification of setting the rig, the first ever in Kuwait and the third only in all Arabia, to work* Some shy applause greeted the vertical jerking of a length of boring pipe by the percussion drilling machine. His Excellency thereafter examined with attention the machinery both at the rig site and afterwards at the workshops. Acetylene welding, in particular stirred hishis interest and he watched, through dark glasses, for some time the cutting of metal by an Indian welder «ho ted already lost one eye through the pursuit of hi s trade. Before leaving the Ruler was shown the Offi ces and storerooms where the Manager of the Company as a parting gift presented him with 2 tins of Nestle's milk His Excellency expressed his very great satisfac tion at everything he had seen and the hope that Oil production would not be far behind. As His Excellency entered his car he was informed that the well had already reached a depth of eight feet* (c) Particulars of the derrick are as follows:- -ht deriick is located approximately atz 47° - 58* - 45' East Longitude. 29 - 36’ - 15' North Latitude, ihe height of the top oi the derrick above mean sea level is 169 ft* It is immediately beneath the &gt; route at present used by Imperial Airways* &gt; The derrick from now om/ards will be lighted whenever work is in progress at night by electricity, there being two single lights at the extreme top and single lights at 20* intervals up the derrick legs. Batteries of flood lights at the 100 ft* mark and at ground level are arranged to give bright illumination of the derrick floor and interior. All lights will be steady This information has been communicated to Imperial Airways and the Basra Port Directorate* 82.OIL IIn[TBRESTS. Aft-Option Concession for the Kuwait Neutral Zone* On the 17th May Major Frank Holmes, representative of Petroleum Concessions Limited, an offspring of the Anglo Iranian Oil Company, presented to His Excellency the Ruler a draft option on a concession in the Kuwait Neutral Zone. His Excellency5 His Excellency decided not to avail himself of •his offer which he refused verbally on the 23rd and conf confirmeed in writing on the 25th, In In the short interval between the verbal and written refusal the Company’s effort was confined to an attempt to obtain a first refusal on the option but no satisfactory progress was made. Some momentary initial confusion was caused by the use of the word 'KHIAR* for 'Option” in the Company’s Arabic craft in place of the correct words 'HAQQ AL IKKTIYAR', (KHIAR means ’’Cucumbers' from Afghanistan to Morocco). Major Iiolmes left Kuwait on the 31st of May, bound for the Trucial Coast. 85 .MUTROROLOG-I CAL. (a) Maximum temperature 106° F. Minimum temperature 7 Q 0 (b) Prevailing i/«inds in Kuwait.

The large cargo-carrying sailing ships of Kuwait which annually visit the Indian and African shores have been coming to the home port in the last few weeks after a rather more than usually successful winter, the carrying trade having been indirectly stimulated by the Abysinnian War. The iftip 'Fath al Bari', Master Yusif ibn mtami, 175 tons, made this year a very quick return from Bombay, taking only ten days. (b) Pearling Beason. --he early pearl dive, the 'Khanchiya', has now left for the banks. The Coiiaaodore of the main Pearling Fleet launched his ship on the 8th May but has not yet left. A slight upward movement in the price of pearls is expected in consequence of the coming Coronation season.

(a) On the 20 of March Captain G.S.de Gaury, M.C., Political Agent, proceeded to Um-an-iiamal Island on a tour of inspection and returned to Headquarters same day. (b) The Political Agent visited FALAICHA Island on the 22 nd March travelling in the Bhaikh 1 s launch. It was intended to return on the 25rd but owing to contrary winds return was put off until the 24th. The delay at Aalaicha enabled the Political Agent to visit the greater part of the Island including the Moslemized Pagan shrine of KHIDHR identified with Dionysls, which at this time of year and throughout the spring, isis visited by pilgrims from Kuvwai t, Iraq and Persia and also though now less frequently, from India and the Yemen, A landing ground although hazardous might be made just to the bouth of the village of Zor in case of need. The inhabitants of the Island, who are free of every kind of tax were found to be prosperous if on a low scale and to have increased in numbers to about 1500. (c) On the 28th and 2 9th March the Xolitical Agent visited by invitation, the members of the ruling family of Kuwait, who at this time of yeai*, camp near the Coast in Southern Kuwait territory. 43. flIRKLi3S3 BKOAOCASTIX^G a^CSPTIOK aT KUwAIT. (i) The new Broadcasting station outside Jerusalem has been clearly received since it opened and is giving local Arab radio owners pleasure. It is clearer than Cairo and seems most likely to take the place of that station as the one to which Arab listeners in this area will in future most often turn. The notables at Kuwait, the reactions of which as possibly the largest Town in Arabia proper, may be of some interest, have in the last few days all expressed their great satisfaction. (ii) Radio battery sets are increasingly taken into use for desert work and their use and effect is still some- fchat surprising to outsiders. In exaogple is that His Majesty King Abdul Aziz when here recently, said that he had listened, while in the desert, to the burial service of His late Majesty and was deeply impressed by the words used by His Grace the archbishop of Canterbury; actually those in the Book of Common Prayer. 44. CAUDI ARABIA. (a) His Excellency the Shaikh and seme other notablesnotables of Kuwait have received begging letters from the Deputy foreign ivinister, bhaikh Fuad Hamza, as Secretary of the Saudi Arab Committee for a public subscrip tion to the Saudi Arab Air force. The circular letters were widely addressed and it is probable that many other Arab leaders have received them. The Shaikh sent for Abdulla an Nafisi, the Saudi Arab Trade Agent here, and explained to him that he did not propose to subscribe to this unusual fund for the arming of a neighbouring country - even if it were Arab. (b) There have recently been faint if persistent rumours that Saudi Arabia is endeavouring to centre round herself a renewed movement for Arab unity and arising out of this perhaps, there have also been rumours that His Majesty King Abdul Aziz would not be strongly averse to a revival of the Caliphate movement in his favour. It seems an unlikely story that Ibn baud would follow the course of the late King Hussain in this respect, a course which crystallizes opposition rather than secures supporters, but rumour persists that at least there is something in it, and the attraction of subscriptions from the sentimentally inclined may be the key. 45.TRIBAL UCTj&amp;AiNTS. Trioal movements are not unusual for the time of ye The locations of the more important sections are as follows:- Saudi Arab frontier, (a) A'..azim. The camel sections are in the Hhaqq depression ./est of the Neutral ^.one (Kuwait). The sheep sections are in the Neutral Tone (Kuwait) and an far North in Kuwait proper as a line6 o2 line uast and Vest through Ma’adaniyat. (b) Mutair, The tents of Mohammad al Badr, Hazza al Badr, Xbn Musaiyis and Ibn Ashwan are along the Batin Valley and in the Shaib al J^ao with some sections in the Neutral -.one (Iraq). The Al Majid are camped about at bAFA and WaBRA which area is at the movment declared a reserve (HAMAIA) for camels the personal property of King Abdul azIz I bn Baud. (c) Ajman. A few unimportant details are camped near ARFAJITA in southern Kuwait with more near WA?Ha• (d) Bani Khalid. Most of the Bani Khalid are in the HAZIM coastal plain in the Neutral Aone (Kuwait) with more in the SUDA coastal district in Saudi ^pabla. Ibn Khazar who came up into Kuwait town from Hazim has now moved his tents into SUDA. 2 ,Iraq frontier, (a) The HAKRa (SHAWIYA) are beginning their return to Iraq by slow stages from their positions south of Kuwait and in the Neutral Zone (Kuwait). (b) The Budur, always inclined to move back earlier than the HAKBA, have already reached the Iraq frontier on their return march. 46 J^TZORQ LOGICAL. . 10 ? of rain fell during the period under review.

At this final good bye, the King graciously invited the writer to visit Hiyath ani continue on to Jedda, when he could get the time to do so. in.- ;hllst in Kuwait His --ajesty lunched or dined in turn with the leading notables of the Town. He also lc calls or hact coffee with many old friends of his childhood days, an attention very much appreciated. (o) curing the latter part of the King's stay several prominent Hasra and ubalr citizens arrived and were received in audience, one of than, oeyed Abdur Rahman al waqib, unfortunately died 24 hours after his arrival as a result of a heart attack.

They should know, said he, vehemently, that between Kuwait and v&gt;audi ^rabia there was life long friendship and sympathy for both itates were one, in blood and origin, ^rther that should he or his otaff ever be in straits he knew full well that the shaikh of Kuwait and all his people would be the first to come to his assistance, as would also he ene with all his people, if Kuwait were ever in peril or need, allowing always for the enthusiasm of the moment, such words b^ar significance, iqj Before the King left for Kiyadh, the shaikh presented him with Hs.25,000/- in cash for himself and his children, robes of honour for himself and his Btaff, and 673 cloaks, 673 Biboons, and 673 head cloths for the attendants. The whole cost of the visit came in other words to slightly over Hs. 100 , 000 , according to the shaikh, but as he put it 'I thank almighty Ood Tor the King’s visit to us, and 1 do not believe the money has been in any wav wasted'. The King in return gave many and suitable presents to all the bhaikh’s staff ana attendants, and Ha. 10.000 In cash to the poor of the city, H, hliaaelf distributed much of this last personally, as he drore through the crowds on his departure, (r) Below will be found a list of those who accompanied His kajesty to Kuwait, U) Uunes of the Kin^ am msiubers of his family, l # H,M,King Abdul ^ziz. 1 S.Kuhammad bin Abdul azIz * s&lt; ? n 3,khaiid ' ' f | 4,iiansur w ' 5, Taisal bin ba’ad a 1-*Abdul llahmanpoor in their own country and good in Kuwait they come up in early spring, and renew imp lies from Ku.*dt.

(c) Similar telegrams were exchanged between the Huler E.II.King C-hazi and tho .uair of Transjordan. £39.NX, Y.hhi On 1st January among the many gooa wishes received by the writer from ^rab friends, were cards from H.!. the'• 11 “'M •t:. 0 H.E.the l^uler of Bahrain, and his son also from H.H. the jair iibdulla, the Baudi Minister in Baghdad am the Mutasarrif l of Basra, H.B.Tahsin All. 240&gt; IRA', K :;iaiT10iw&gt; (a) Up to the time of writing the ohaikh of Kuwaiti launch which was seized early in Aecember at Fao ana full duty demanded on it , had not been released, even though necessary representations had been mane by II.k* s ^jabassaaor to tho Iraq Government. The matter was dealt with in separate report. The launch is now said to be at Basra. (b) There were rumours at the end of December that the Iraq Government were preparing to try am force Kuwaitis entering Iraq, to pay 10 gold francs for their visas, and had already approached Ifce British ,mbassy in this connection. The move, if tx*ue, can only be regarded as another unfortunate attempt to hurt Kuwait, seeing that on an average a hundred persons visit ^asra per month during normal times while during the ,uimaer months several thousand woman and children of the poorest classes regularly visit the ^naikhs cate gardens in . Iraq both to get away from the intense heat here and to find employment as date pickers am packers. It will be quite impossible for this latter class to afford ten gold francs for their visas. Aor tho information of those reading this at a distance, it has been the custom for many years now for this ikgency to charge only He.l/- on all persons proceeding from Kuwait to Basra as well as to India and other i^rabian ports, and the Bhaisn'e ateauy policy h&amp;* been to aia.ow all nationals of such ^rab Btates more especially Iraqis to enter Kuwait on payment of the equivalent of Ae. l/~. Unfortunately the British Consular authorities in Iraq would seem to have been steadily charging Iraqis proceeding to Kuwait As.7/8/- or the Tils equivalent, which may have given rise to the story that thw Iraq Government were now out to retaliate. Clearly anc' xii tka interest of friendly relations and intercourse, especially toto assist the very poor aate packers and pickers, ana other poor travellers who visit Fao, the visa charges for Iraqis visiting Kuwait should be reauced to the equivalent of He. 1 /- especially too as the Kuwait OovernLient desires this. Kor can the Iraq G-ovornment claim that the increased visa which they apparently want Kuwaitis to pay, will affect smuggling, if this is fheir intention, for those engaged in smuggling are Iraqi tribesmen, who never have passports of any kind, and enter the town, as desert men pure and simple. These smugglers naturally never cone near tMis Agency but disappear into the desert again when th^r have got what they want. (c) On the plea of tightening up anti smuggler activities, it is also reported that travellers proceeding by car to Basra, are no longer able to take their car, into Iraq, after registering it at the Customs House at ioibeir for the fee of Hs.2/8/-, as heretofore, is said that the traveller now must take his car under police escort, to the Central Customs House at Basra, and there give money security that he hae no intention of selling the car. How this measure can affect the smuggling fraternity’s activities it is difficult to see. Bteps are being taken to find out exactly what the rule is in this respect, though on the surface it would seem that law abiding travellers are going to be penalized, for the sins of the wily smuggler. 241.cling .vmi ira (a) News was received and confirmed on 20th December that another large band of land smugglers was recently rounded up by an Iraq Patrolling rolice force close to the southern shore of the Liamar z.&amp;ke, ana all their goods captured. (b) It appears that the smugglers were as usual tribesmen hailing from Iraq, and that they formed an initial secret dump in tb© Dibdibba region of the desert seme sixty miles west of Kuwait - about 10th iieoember they apparently hired oamels fraa the Bedouin and sent ttoair goods across the KuwaitKuwait border in the direction of Iraq. The camel men with som 140 camels proceeded to hhashaim ^aiyid, a spot on the southern shore of the Hamer Lake (This is same place where the first round up took place in October last) and began to unload the smugglers goods there on night of 13/l4th December. (c) Whilst doing this they were suddenly attacked by an Iraq Police Patrol. The camel men at once fled losing 10 camels, killed in the dark and all the cargo. (d) Hext morning pursuing police cars came up with 80 camels, which were goihg south, in liie vicinity of Mamaila and captured the lot, one of the party an iUtfOU-uK admitting that it was they who had been engaged in carrying the goods captured, the previous nijajit. te) The remaining 60 camels which had been engaged in the attempt, and which with their owners had scattered in the night, got away. (f) The men captured with 80 camels It is said, numbered 20, and were all men of the -unaze and Dhafir tribe, except for 1 Washidi and 1 Mutairi tribesmen, who owed allegiance to Kuwait. (g) The actual owners of the stuff' (all Iraqis) were not it seems with the caravan when it was rounded up but had gone ahead to await the party* s arrival with ballams which had been sent to convey the cargo across the Uaxaar Lake. (H) The goods it seems were destined for the Town of Ledina near Kurna, from which place hailed the owners of the cargo. (i) The above smart piece of work on the part of the Iraq Police deserves special commendation, and will deal a second paralysing blow at the smuggling fraternity, who as reported in my last .^uBt*€iry are in moribund condition, and at their wits end to know how to circumvent the very active efforts that are now in force to trap them. The Jhaikh/The t&gt;haiich has expressed his delight in no uncertain terms at this fresh coup on the part of the Iraq Police. 242 .v J. xOLOG (a) 1.91' of rain fell during the period under review (b) Maximum temperature ••••• 68 .P.

(a) This has betn very satisfactory up to the time of writing, and a total of 1.7” of rain has been recorded in the Agency rain guage, as having fallen since 12th November 19 35. (b) The satisfactory feature is that no heavy downpour took place anywhere, but a series of good and frequent drizzles. There latter do the countryside much more good than heavy falls. (c) In the hinterland of Kuwait good rains have fallen / everywhere, and the same may be said of the whole of the Hassa Province, the 3uxm.ian region (Mutair country) and the Iraq southern Desert. (d) These widespread rains have now definitely removed all grazing anxiety from the minds of the Badawin of North East Arabia and the winter and opring of 1935-36 promise a most excellent hay crop in the Desert. / « 224.TRIBaL LOCATIONS. (a) The Kuwait tribes (Eiddawiyeh and -tiraibdar) are all camped in the v arau region west of the ^haqq. (b) The Av/azim (Baudi Tribe) are spread over the Kuw? Neutral Eone , and the region to the *est of it. (o)(o) The iuutalr have moved north from the busman region and are grazing to the south of the Kuwait Badawin in the Q,araa region. (d) The ohamiaar elements who summered in force in Kuwait have all moved westward into the southern Iraq Desert. (e) Thu muntafiu shepherd tribes have not so far entered Kuwait territory, as is their annual custom. Reports say that this is because their own grazing is above the average. On the other hand it is possible that the Iraq authorities have stopped them, as part of their anti-smuggling measures. 225.IAW xM) ORDISR. The excellent raine has had the usual effect of keeping the whole Badawin world happy and so quiet, leace reigns everywhere in the interior. 226.BIH SaIID's BLOCKAUK. a/* 2o Of ***&lt; (a) frothing to report. (b) There was a small incident at Riga! (south west corner of Kuwait) which was not of much importance and can be summed up as follows. The Baudi Blockade post there, under the command of the now notorious Haif ^bu bhijera (the individual who caused all the trouble at bubahiyeh last may when he crossed the border and tried to eject bhammar camped there), tried to prevent :ome Kuwait Rishaida from drinking at the nigai water hole. This they had no right to do by Desert law and a scuffle ensued resulting in Haif’s men seizing a camel and a hawk from the Rishaida. iis the incident might easily have ended in serious reprisals, the bhaikh sent out A 1 Nafisi’s son to interview Haif and his men and settle the matter amicably. The result was the restitution of the camel and hawk. COMkuSfrT. The presence of Haif Abu bhijera in the frontier is being watched, as men of his kidney are apt to cause trouble. The placing of this man at Rigai is provocative, to say the least of it 227./4 227.LACK OF MON;,Y IN o^I iUUfaXA. On 11th a well teno-sn Ktwaiti tribesman who had g on* to Hiath as leader or a party who took a present of 12 mares to Bin 3aud months ago ; returned. In an interview with the writer he said that the King had accepted the mares willingly ana had given him an oraer on Ibn Jiluwi, to receive Rs.2400/- from the Hassa 'ireasury. The latter had kept him waiting for his money for three months, always on the excuse that there was no money in the Treasury. After the death of the ^onir, the Kuwaiti approached the new incumbent, Saud al Jiluwi. The latter sent for i. ohamed al r iawil and up-braided him sharply for not settling the King’s debts end so bringing shame on the good name of the ^1 oaud. Al Tawil again excused himself, saying that the Treasury was quite empty, whereupon iuuir baud ordered the Kuwaiti to go to Jubail and get his money, and gavo him letters to the Gove nor and Customs Officer there to pay y up on their peril. The Kuwaiti went to Jubail and after Id days got his money. It was extorted from merchants there and not found from the Treasury, which as at Hoffuf was empty. Delighted, the Kuwaiti returned to his home full of praise for baud bin Abaulla al Jiluwi. had been 4 months tlying to get his money in Hoffuf, and said that he was most lucky for several hundred was still there when he left, who all had money owing them by the baudi administration for far longer periods than himself. 2 28 . oMUGGL JLhd IK TO IRA*.. (a) The anti-smuggling activities of the Iraq Government continue to be most successful, and the Euphrates smuggling fraternity are havirg a very poor time indeed now. (b) The writer estimates that anuggling into Iraq has now been reduced by quite 0O&gt; of its fomer figure, since Yasin Pasha decided to take the strong measures he has done on the Kuwait frontier. (c) The bhaikh on 14th December again expressed himselfhimself to the writer as most gratified with the state of affairs, and triumphantly pointed out that what he had advocated many months as being the one and only solution for A the evil, had practically 'scotched' the smuggling already,and after only some two months of serious effort. He opined, that if the present methods were continued and not allowed to slacken off, the trouble would be settled for good. The Shaikh pointed out also, that the effort as far as numbers of men and guards were employed, was remarkably small, and must be costing the Iraq Government scarcely anything, which entirely belied the previous statements of certain Iraqi politicians, that to successfully stop smuggling from Kuwait, would cost a fortune, and necessitate a strong coraon of troops along the frontier. As far as one can see no troops at all are being used and the whole successful business is being managed by a few smart Customs preventive police equipped with 4 Ford armed cars and wireless Ford Car, and two Ford lorries for accommodating escorts. It is the excellent methods employed and the fact that the smugglers now know that the Iraq Government is at long last taking serious steps on the frontier that have so successfully done the trick. 229. MUNICIPAL. (a) During the period under review, a well equipped chemist shop was opened in Kuwait in Kuwait under charge of a qualified compunder. This was a much wanted need. (b) A local company styling itself the Kuwait Landing Company was successfully floated during early December. This also was badly recuired to handle cargo from ships and transport to the shore.

Over a year ago and on the outbreak of hostilities bet¥/een Bin Baud and Yemen, the writer reported that the above two Shaikhs together wi th sultan ibn Hums id of the Ataiba had been secretly transferred to Hoffuf and there placed under the care of Xbn Jiluwi* The general Batiawin view held at the time was that, this would certainly mean the death of the abovementioned persons, as the Governor of Hassa, kept tai underground dungeon (known as the f *hnbas al .haina Tt )from which no one was ever known to come out aliv That these views have unfortunately turned out correct is now certain, for the widow of Ibn Hatklain visited the writer on 2 nd Kovember and confirmed that the King had authorized her to marry again and had given the same permission to Xbn Lemi’s wife* The latter married one Farhan ibn Khudaiyir in October last. This Boyal permission for the ladies to remarry is proof positive that the shaikhs in question are now dead.

Ui) On three occasions in Novauiber the dhaikh mention ed to the writer the violent anti-British propaganda.which was almost nightly being broadcast in Arabic from the Italian Radio station of Bari. This according to the Shaikh culminated in enthusiastic exhortations to the Jgyptian youth, to rise and smite ths uiglish in gypt, dur ing the recent Egyptian riots. The shaikh mentioned the matter also in convers ation with H.M*s Minister, dedda and expressed some surprise that Hie Aiajesty’s Government had beun unable to stop this form of propaganda. 210 . &lt;Ji? I BN On 31st October 1^35, Abdulla bin Jiluwi, for many years Governor of Hassa died. The ohaixh of Kuwait and leading members of the a! bubah sent telegraphic messages of condolence to H.M. the King at Hiath, as well Ibn Jiluwi was of the House of ^1 baud, his grandfather being younger brother of the great Faisal, grandfather of the present King. He was one of the famous forlorn hope of 20 who taking their lives in their hand entered Kiath with their Chief Abdul azIz ana by a remarkable coup be main seized the Town from the Haohld forces, after slaying their leader, ’Ajlan, as he fled for refuge to the kut or fort. It was actually Bin Jiluwi’s sword which struck down Ajlan after Abdul Aziz» s spear which he hurled at the fleeing ’Ajlan’Ajlan had missed its mark. Ibn Jiluwi was fameci throu^Jhout oaudi Arabia for his coorage ana loyalty to his master, also for his remark able aptitude for instilling fear into the Badawin, and incidentally for the heaviness of hia hand, -any stories are extant of his ^oloman like justice, and for the fact that he never had the slightest Mercy on an Jvil-doer. Through the death of Xbn ^iiuwi, Bin -aud has lost a great administrator and f&amp;ichful supporter, while the Bedawin world, notably the Ajman are today rejoicing and thanking God for removing a man they considered their greatest enemy. 2 X 1«-B Is V TH iv ii( rl tj . Two ^jmaxi chaikhs who returned fi'om the i urra country via Biath on 5th and Bth November respectively, brought the following news from the Capital which is of interest. (a) &gt;;aud al Arafa proceeded to Harath (slightly north of Jabrin) late in October to see his camels grazing there, hey lerrned frora him that the i^mir Faisal visited Hiath in October and married his l^aud*s)daughter. (^) H.M.tha King visited his stud farm at i-amuda (known also as GINaIFJHa) lying south west of Ghat Ghat in the latter half of October and spent several days there. (c) Camels in large numbers were being bou$it every where round Biath end sent off to ^edixk weekly. .ach was branded with a cross on its rear quarters. Various herdsmen who they saw and discussed the matter with declared that any old and rather feeble camels were being acquired, young stock was deliberately not taken (oee previous nummary). (d) *1 Bhuwaish by ath November, had not returned with the .aiiir kawaf al ohaalan's daughters from Damascus (see previous ^ummary). le) 'i’he king’s feelings for the shaikh of Kuwait hadhad appeared to have undergone a great change for the better- with the receipt of the present of six hawks from the latter in October (para 198(b) of oumxi^ry No*17) and the King was as delighted with the birds as a schoolboy, and continually sent for and played with the birds. Ihe gift bad been the more appreciated, as hawks were very scarce in iiejd this Unte (f) ..11 was quiet in Hiath, though there was continual gossip of coming trouble in Kejran. is) Both informants gave the curious piece of news that uair faisal had ousted the ..mir ^ a ud in popularity since the latter’s return from ngland. fhey also told the strange story that oaud had spread the story in Biath that the Shaikh of Kuwait had said some insulting things to His Majesty Government, about him (Saud) whilst both were in London. ^- One knows nothing of both these stories in Kuwait. the x.ing wrote to the ohai h of Kuwait unoer letter ITo.99/2/35, dated the bth Kovember 1955, proposing that the well known desert Law of AiUJ?A, applied in connection with lost or stolen camels should be reciprocally worked as between B&amp;udi Arabia and Kuwait btate. The Shaikh verbally told the writer that he welcomed such move, and the King * s desire to put such problems on an official basis. The King in a separate and cordial letter received at the same time, again thanked the shaikh for hie valuable gift of hunting hawks, and said that if sport this year was poor near the Capital, he intended visiting the borders of Kuwait, to hunt in the Garaa and Dibdibba regions between the ^haqq and Higai. COMiAiJ^T. The above attempts to improve relations may have something to do with H*M f a Minister’s coming visit to his Capital. 212 s IRAQ. KHLaTIOUK. These seem to be better than t iey have been for some time. The writer puts this down to the fact that thethat the Iraq Government wouia appear to be still vigorously pressing on with her new anti-smuggling policy on the Kuwait frontier*. The measures taken are unuerstood by all, and are being especially taken to heart by the Euphrates and Desert tribes of Iraq. Erom careful enquiry and dose personal observation, smuggling from Kuwait to Iraq would appear to have dropped by considerably over half in the last two months, and the shaikh confirmed this to Hia Majesty’s ambassador on IQth Kovambar, whan the matter was discussed in Kuwait* This the oh&amp;ikh added, gave him satisfaction. One naturally does not know all the measures that are being taken by the Iraq authorities to deal with saugglers, but one hopes that they have placed a mobile armed caf post at Dusaiya, similar to the one now existing at ^afwan, as it is very necessary that the area known as the Dibdibba lying west of the Ha.TIN Valley between iOthaiba and Ubaid, should be constantly patrolled. This can best be done from busaiya post, though one makes this suggestion with apologies. The writer also ventures to suggest that if a single Iraq army aeroplane were based on Kalman port, to assist the above two car patrols by reconnoitring ground behind them, results would be worth the expense incurred. The anti-smuggling measures known already to exist are (a) Eatrol of 4 armed Sora Cars with wireless car a t ^ afwan (mobile;, (b) xn armed dhow and launch stationed in the Khor lubair (mobile). (c) oiaall desert police post (8 men) at Jafwar (a) Jmall Desert police post (11 men) at Ura v asr.

On the 21 st of October, he arrived in Baghdad and after a short stay there returned to Kuwait again on 25th October. It is stated that his visit was purely in the nature of a holiday. Shaikh Abdulla, after His Excellency the Shaikh, is quite the most outstanding personality in Kuwait. 195.TOURS Off THE POLITICAL AGENT. (a) On the 14th of October the Political Agent visited Ras Kathama on the North side of the Bay of Kuwait to satisfy himself that it was possible for laden dhows to come alongside the shore there and discharge cargo at high water. In this connection see para 174(b) of Kuwait Suramary No. 15. It will be recollected that Mr.Pattinson of the A.I.O.C., acting on behalf of the K.O.C., visited the same spot and for the same purpose on 4th September last, and reported favourably on the site: The Political Agent was able to confirm Mr.Pat tin- son’s report. (b) On 24th October the Political Agent visited Ras A1 Arth lighthouse to examine the light keeper’s residence there, which was in tumble down condition and needed repairs. (c) On 26th October the Political Agent visited the camp of Shaikh Lafi bin Maalath on the slopes of Arhaiya to enquire into a reported outbreak of smallpox there: The report proved to be incorrect. (d) On 27th October the Political Agent visited the very large Bedouin camp at Jahara in company with Shaikh Mutluq as Bur of the Mutair tribe: His object as in (c) was to see if there were any smallpox cases among the Bedouin. Two mild cases of smallpox were discovered among persons said to have recently arrived from Riyath, but as these had been immediately segregated by the iuair of Jahara and theand the infected tents pitched far frcm the village and camps it was considered that there was little danger of a spread of the disease. Fortunately with the advent of the cold weather, the Bedouin are everywhere breaking up camp, and proceeding into the interior: This should effectively kill any danger of a spread of the disease. 196.ITALO-AByslUNlA CONFLICT. This continues to be the chief subject of interest and provides all and sundry with full opportunity to gossip and speculate to their hearts content, on the chances of the 'Habasha' (as the Abysinnians are called) to bring off a win. Needless to say the Kuwaitis from their Ruler down wards, are still intensely pro-Abysinnia. The recently It ^ approved 'sanctions' and the knowledge that Abysinnia would now be able to import anus, have in the eyes of the local experts considerably increased the chances of Abysinnia; The strong feeling against Italy which exists locally, and as far as one can gather everywhere among the Bedouin in the interior of Nejd, is interesting, and is due to a variety of causes, chief among which would appear to be the following:- Italy’s past record in North Africa, and her treatment of liohammedans there is still green in the peoples memory. Italy’s calm boast that she will take Abysinnia, cost what it may, is interpreted as pure unblushing banditry. According to .Arab argument she clearly covets what she believes to be a country full of riches and wealth and has picked a wicked quarrel in order to attain her ends - she is urged on by 'Tammah'(covetous ness) and as such God Himself will not agree to her success, so why should man. Abysinnia is likened to a poor woman, who- 4 - 125 who struggling to keep her modesty and virtue before the world, has fallen under the licentious gaze of an unprincipled and immoral man, who has decided to seize and possess her, believing that no one will consider it worth while to come to her rescue or protect her, (d) The Arab firmly believes that the Muslim States of Arabia are in the same category as Abysinnia and their turn might any day come next, COMMENT* As regards (d) it should always be remembered that among certain Arab States of the Persian Gulf and throughout Arabia for that matter, there has for long existed a deep undercurrent of suspicion against the so called 'Colonizing States' of Europe and wherever possible (for example in Saudi Arabia) Europeans have always been suspect and kept at arms length. Though many of us have for years endeavoured to point out that these suspicions were foolish and unreasonable, certainly where Great Britain was ccneerned, local politicians to have so/speak always shaken their heads and said 'V7e know better'. Today Italy f s adventure has given these self-same wiseacres full opportunity to say 'Bid we not tell you so?' In the humble opinion of the writer we English should take the lesson of Italy to heart, and more than ever, go out of our way to try and prove that our alliances and agreements with Arab States begin and end with wanting to protect them from covetous and awkward neighbours, and that, so long as our interests are not endangered, the last thing in the world that we want to do is to absorb them, or interfere in anyway^ in their internal affairs. If we follow this line, we shall a win confidence, prove our sincerity and ly the foundation for mutual trust and affection. It follows that If England continues to support Abysinnia as she is doing, her stock will continue to go up among her Arab well-wishers, sane of whom, of recent years, have grown somewhat sceptical of her j5 I2h of her assurances. 197.TRIBAL AND HINTERLkNV NJMS. (a) The end of the hot weather is producing a general stir throughout the Bedouin world, and everywhere the great tribal Siammer cone oat rat ions on wells show sigis of breaking up. The Bedouins camped in Kuwait have heard of the rains whic&amp; • have fallen in the desert between Palestine Syria and Iraq, and the distant lightning in the far North tfest, seen for several nights in succession from the 16th October and onwards, has filled the Nomads heart with joy. The last fortni^bt of October has seen great numbers of Shammar, Dhafir, s^naze, Ajman and Awazim coming up to Kuwait, and buying supplies for their cold weather needs. These have ccrae in mostly from Bubahiyeh, Tawil and Jahara wells, on which an immense number of tents are still to be seen. Incidentally the writer visited Jahara on 27th October, and estimated that the number of tents there still numbered 2000, though the Shaikh’s Amir in charge, stated that during September and early October quite 4000 tents stretched over the Jahara area, and that for a period of 2$ months, the watering of camels and sheep went on ni$it and day without ceasing at all, so great was the crush of animals that had to be watered. (b) The following were the locations of the various Bedouin tribes in Kuwait State on 30th October. (i) Subahiyeh. Shammar (Tooman) under Mishaal al Timiat and Dhafir - under Ajemi and Jedaan as Suwait. (Both owe allegiance to Saudi Arabia). (ii)(ii) Tawll Ajman, Mutair and Awazim sections, (owing allegiance to Kuwait), ( iii) Jahara, Sliammar (Aslam) under ibn Twala, Dahamsha (Anaze), Dhafir — under Hantush as Kuwait, Araibdar - \mder Amir Half bin Hajraf, (Owing allegiance to Bin Baud,Iraq, Iraq, and Kuwait respectively). NOTE. For the information of the uninitiated, Subahiveh, lawi1 and Jahara , are the great well areas where permanent water exists in Kumiit State, and always attract many important groups of the desert population every Summer, owing to the proximity and convenience of Kuwait for supplies. 198.RIATH NSWS. (a) The Shaikh of Kuwait during October received several congratulatory letters and telegrams from the King and the Amir Baud, in answer to letters sent by himself, describing his European tour and safe return. (b) The Shaikh sent several hunting falcons to Bin Baud early in October as presents, and received suitable replies in return. (c) Both the Shaikhs messengers and others arriving from Riath, report that in spite of the above outward messages of good will, the King is still deeply incensed against the Bhaikh of Kuwait for, as he says, 'having got him into trouble with the English over the 5 men incident of early Summer' and that all persons coming from Kuwait, even with permits, are suspected of being so called spies and are treated with contumely by palace underlings and junior officials. (d) A very reliable person (well known to me) wrote from Riath under date 10.10.35 that 'according to local gossip the Imam Yahya’s son was busily engaged in fortifying the whole length of the Yemen Northern frontier, and was supposed to be preparing for a second war' #7 - * ^ A That ^Ibn Sauds intentions towards Kuwait and Ibn Subah were unfriendly, and that both the Political iigent and the Shaikh should be on their guard, as an incident might befall any day'. ( e ) Tribal news has it that Bin Baud is still making heavy camel purchases, and persists in saying that the King is preparing for a big raid either North or South or North- Westerly direction, but they cannot say for certain where. (f) Two Mutairi Shaikhs have reported to me that in their opinion either Aqaba or Kuwait is the objective. ( g ) in the meatnime Bin Saud is definitely preparing for marriage with the daughter of Nawaf o£ Shaalan of the Anaze (sister of Fawaz). Also that late in September he sent his confidential servant A1 Shuwaish to Damascus with five cars, to bring back the lady • COMMENT. The above scmewhat alarmist stories are repOxtecl for what they are worth, but it would be unsafe at this stage to attempt to prophesy, what Bin £»ud has in mind, if fa. has anything at all. The probabilities are (as already mentioned in para 188 of Kuwait Intelligence Summary No. 15 and Comments) that Bin 3aud*s heavy buying of camels is to resell than again to the Italians at a personal profit, and that feeling that he might arouse critioian among his people who are very anti-Italian by such action, he is spreading the report of se_t purpose, that he intends raiding some supposed enemy, hostile to Nejd. Bin Saud is, as we know, an expert at influencing public opinion, and what easier at J the present moment than to drag a Kuwait, Aqaba .Yemen or | J Qatar red herring across the path of his real intentions. (ii) The Shaikh of Kuwait in a conversation on 26th October about this very subject, gave it as his definite opinion that Bin Saud bad no hostile intentions whatsoever against any State or person, and that all his big talk in Riyath was so much propaganda in order to focus the eyes of all the tribes on himself, and to keep them 'guessing'.This alwaysalways had a good effect internally, and helped to mystify outside Govemi/iente: It was clearly Bin Baud’s policy for instance, today, to make His Majesty’s Government think that he had leanings towards Italy, as this would in his opinion, tend to make them nervous and so enable him to get things he ?fanted out of them. 'One thing was as clear as daylight”, said the Shaikh, 'Bin Baud will never quarrel seriously with Great Britain” - with this view I agree. 199.RELATIONS «/ITH IH4Q,. There are indications that these are slightly on the mend, as the following will show: (a) The Ruler’s son Shaikh Mohamed al Ahmad, who is now in residence at Fao having been put in charge of his father’s gardens, seems to be making excellent progress both in his relations with the fellaheen and with Government officials: He is now his father’s sole Agent since the dismissal of Mr.Agoob Gabriel. The latter, there can be no dcubt now, believed in the old adage of 'divide and rule' and seems to have done his best to 'queer relations' betv/een the Shaikh and the Mutasarrif am the Shaikh and his fellaheen. In the pro cess he would appear also to have come out very well financially himself, the Shaikh having lost over a lac of rupees in litigation since he employed Mr.Gabriel, and got practically no rentals into the bargain, especially in 1935. (b) Seyed Hamid Beg al Naqib would appear to be 'fathering' Shaikh Mohamed in no uncertain fashion, and with his wide experience as landlord of extensive estates in Basra, to be giving the Boy wise advice. Already he has taken Shaikh Mohamad to see the Mutasarrif at Basra, and pleasant letters have passed between S e yed Hamid, the Shaikh ana kae Mutasarrif. (o) The Shaikh told the writer oa 26.10.35. that he was making a great effort especially by means of his old friend Seyed Hamid Beg al Naqib to bring about better relations between himself and Iraq, and urged me to further his9 ! 2 &gt;o farther his efforts towards this end. by every means in my power. He added that if only Iraq would treat him better, and appreciate his point of view more generously he for his part had many ways of showing his gratitude. It was a 'trait* of his, he said, to repay a person who did him a kindness, by a double kindness, so why not to a G-overnment doing th e same • It is early perhaps to buoy oneself up with hopes in this matter, but signs are not wanting that persons on both sides are working for a better understanding. This is all to the good £ 00 .OIL. Nothing to report. 201 .M£TK0R0LQGICaL.

The whole fleet as well as H.S. the shaikh re turned on 26th September amidst scenes of usual rejoicing. 186.POLITICAL AGPHT'S TOURS. On his journey to Basra on 30th September 1935, the Political Agent took the opportunity to officially visit Jahara and safwan. At the former place he found a remarkable concentration of Shankar and Dhafir tribal tents, while at Safwan he met five armed cars belonging to the Iraq Preventive Police. Jwo of these cars were armed with machine guns. ISV.ITATflY AMD ABYSIMHIA. (a) During the period under review unusual interest has been taken in the grave happenings which have rapidly been developing in Eritrea. From the Ruler downward the conviction has bee* gaining ground steadily that ngland will somehow or other stop the war clearly now contemplated by the Italians. (bj The League of Nations, which curiously enough, is believed by all to be Great Britain, and no one else, is on its sunreme trial, says the popular voice, und will coma to3 come to an end if it does not take her courage between her two hands, and do something definite and final. ( c ) Letters from Kuwait merchants in Aden to the Shaikh, (which regularly come through via Karachi bnd by air onwards) have it that the Authorities there have put their house in order and are ready for all eventualities: Indeed the Mtterj state that from the naval, military and air preparations going on there, England would appear to be about to enter on war herself if Italy does not hold her hand. (d) Similar news from Egypt and Haifa adds confirmation to the above belief. (e) As a result of these war rumours, the price of sugar, tea, coffee and other connaodities in Kuwait has gone up 20 %. (f) The more ignorant Bedouin world firmly believes that England is definitely the 'protecting power' to Abysinnia, just as she is to Iraq, Bahrain and Kuwait, and so must of necessity come to Abysinnia’s help if Italy decides to attack. (g) Both townsmen and Beduoin are of opinion that if war comes Bin Baud will in some way or other take advantage of it. They point to Yemen and Saif ul Islam as a likely target. (h) The above war rumours have proved to the local Arab the tremendous advantages of Radio receiving sets and the number now in the Town has risen to 24 while many more are on order. Dutch Phillips sets seem to be the most popular. 1Q8.RIATH HEWS. (a) Everything points to quiet in the Saudi Arabian Capital, although frcan Mutair sources it is said that Bin Saud has started buying camels, the excuse being given that he is not satisfied with the attitude of Yemen and Saif al Islam, the Heir Apparent. The latter is said to hold the reins of Government in his hands today and to have forced the Imem Yahya to take a back seat, lb)- 4 - (b) Fran tribal sources it is stated that Bin Saud^ own private canel herd of some 800 animals, hitherto in the care ol Faisal bin Shiblan, Shaikh of the Jiblan sept of the Mutair, have been brought to Riath* ( 0 ) A very secret communication to the writer from Riath dated 24th September, states that Bin Saud is definitely contemplating an expedition of sorts towards the South, but in what direction is uncertain. The same communication says that Kuv/ait is in the very bad books of the King, who quite openly talks of the hostility of the Shaikh. COMMENT. Reference (a) and (b) above: This camel buying is curious, but probably is connected with the efforts of Italian Agents in Hejaz to buy camels for war purposes in liritrea. Reference (c): The reference to Kuwait clearly is connected with the crossing of the frontier by the 5 armed Saudi guards early in the Summer, and His Majesty’s Govern ment’s ’’Notes” to the King. The latter took great offence at the time at these notes, and as already stated now bears a nasty grudge against Kuwait. No doubt he will 'bite' when he gets the chance, for 'Bin Saud does not forget a scratch in a hurry”. 189.SMUGGLING &gt;'IfH IRiW. Reference para 178 of Kuwait Intelligence Sumr;ary No.15. The following further points may be found of interest. (a) All the articles captured on the Southern shore of the Hamar Lake, are now said to have belonged to merchants from the Muntafik Liwa (fmotably Dhatra). (b) The Bedouin mentioned in sub paras (c)(d) of para 17E (referred to above) as being the smugglers,turned out to be the owners of the camels which carried the goods - They were paid Rs.5/- as hire for each camel • (o) The losses suffered by the smugglers are nob put U r5 put down at one Hashidi from Saudi Arabia killed, and one missing (probably captured). (d) The successful capture of such a large cargo of contraband goods in one coup has had the finest effect possible, and the writer is reliably informed that the smuggling fraternity of Iraq with their confederates in Kuwait, will take long to recover from the 'set back' received. This is all to the good and bears out the writer’s repeated statements, that if only the Iraq Preventive Police would make a proper effort on the frontier, smuggling from Kuwait would be definitely checked and reduced tc the merest 'trickle'. (e) Apart from the successful coup of the 2nd September (referred to above), the establishment of a strong Police—cum—Customs post at bafwan, with 5 armed cars for patrol work on the Kuwait-Iraq frontier, (&amp;« (See para 186 above) has had a remarkably healthy effect. Careful and confidential enquiries have satisfied the writer that as a result of this show of strength, snuggling from Kuwait has in the last month practically ceased. 190.METEOROLOGICAL.

At this aestUiH the thsiJch said that he asked wby it was that the Iraq ^ovsrnasnt oould not treat hia as a neighbouring and friendly ruler t and instead of as a ©riainsl who had no ri^its. According to the shaikh, he told Aaahld ,ai that moag Artbt the honourable treataent of neighbours! was looked upcm as one of the greatest and most sacred things in life after God, and h© appealed to the Minister as s noble Arab himself to do his best to see that he (the shaikh) received raore consideration and honourable trsstiasnt from the Iraq Government than heretofore. The haikh said t at the Minister appeared genuinely touched by this sp sal, and promtdea to do all he could to see that the gardens dispute, was dealt with on a 'higher plsae' and with less intent to hurt than in the past* U) As regard* his treatment by His Majesty's Gersnment'a representatives of all grades in London, the shaikh spoke most enthusiastisally,and to us# his words, 'From a#M.the Ling's most gracious person and downwards, 1 was welcomed as only the luigllsh know how to welcome a stranger within their gates, and from the movement I landed at Lover, I was made to feel that X was indeed in my own home and among people who bore me a real affections (e) The t&amp;alkh spoke particularly highly of the kind and sympathetic treatment which he received from Lord wetland, Mr*#alton and Mr*Laithwaite of the Indie office, as well ae fro. SoreifSU Utl'Lcm afrioiala, he ctuue in ooutaot with’’. (f) The &gt;J)BJUch appeared to here boon also aueh touched by the kindly enoourasoewnt given him by E.ii* the Kin* at the loyal .vudlence and by the thoughtful eare etoioh had bean taken by the India Of floe to bring together varloua old friends (notably lilr y.JiUox and .dmlrol Sir Dunbar- esultti ,V.C. ,3.H.) on the occasion of the banquet which the India Office honoured bln with. (s)(g) A* regards his visit to Damascus, Haifa, Jerusalem, jataan, Cairo and . lexandaria (at which last plooa he incidentally called on the Vice-Admiral Forbes, Corananderw in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet), the shaikh expressed the deepest gratitude for all that had been done to r^: - his tour s happy and agreeable ones as he himself put it **rery linglish official and every Arab hotable seemed bent on doing me honour and letting the World know that little Kuwait exists on the map n # The persons he especially Bingled out tor his thanks, were H«U's Consul in iJama&amp;ous, the Governor of Haifa, the Amir Abdulla and the Port Authorities at Alexandria, and he expressed the hope that his grateful appreciation for what those officials had done for him could be in some way conveyed to those officials, (k) 'or the rest the shaikh looked wonderfully well, on his arrival at Kuwait and a far more happy 9 contented and fit man than X have seen him for years past, li) As for the people of iUiwalt, the safe return of their Shaikh and ruler, was celebrated by seenes of the most amazing enthusiasm and loyalty that it has been the lot of the writer to see in an oriental country, (in this connection see para 123 of Kuwait nummary ho. 11). One never for a moment guessed that the people of Kuwait had such deep and genuine affection for their Kuler. It was quite touching sight to see 'weeping' tribesmen and townsmen striving with each other to seize and kiss the hands of their shaikh end kaeter, ana to hear the ululationa and * cries of welcome from seme 2000 wemen (many of t:aein of gentle birth) who had collected at the gate of the city by which he entered. At a very conservative estimate 26,000 person® were on the aerodrome, excluding several thousand Bedouin who had come from places far in th&lt;* interior to welcome their Chief home. Of this number quite 4000 managed to fight their way to the shaikh and embrace him. (jj Although every precaution had been taken tot ale on to control tirn crowd by means of 300 police and orcieu men 9 who were drawn up in double line from the aeroplane to the reoeptlon shed, the crowd was not to be denied, no sooner had the Jhalkh descended from the aircraft and reached the shed, than a wild rush took place, which swept police, armed men, and controlling officere off their legs, /or a full hour the crowd took charge, and even the Political Agent assisted the police in their fight to keep a clear space round the Lhaikh. The latter had a smile and kind word for every person. (k) Once dear from the aerodrome the j haikh mace it his first duty to go and see his agod mother, after which he proceeded to Desman and to his wife and children. X have described the above in detail of set purpose as behind this extraordinary welcome of the people of Kuwait, there appeared to be something far deeper than mere Joy at the return of their Kuler. One had not to see far to know what this was. In the eyes of his subjects the shaikh had gone to inland in July to fight a ' dire and imiiediate parll ,, i The belief then was widespread (and unfortunately nothing that the writer could do or say appeared to hare much of a reassuring effect) that Iraq was to be given political control ovor Kuwait by His Majesty's Government, but 'Thlar .haikh had 'appealed to Caesar', end had wonreoognitlon and justice, Kuwait waa saved, and bloodabed end perhaps worse bed been avoided'. ^ 177.Tiaiici. ;uJh LOCAU'XQNC, (a) The general feeling of nervousness (reported in para 167 of Summary Ho.lt) which of late seemed to be runn^n* right through the Kuwait and foreign tribes in the hinterland due to fear lest Bin i&gt;aud might start some form of 'New 31te againet Kuwait, happily almoat disappeared, with the arri/ol back of the Holer, for in the same way as the latter was fell- 6 - f0lt t0 have boon successful in countering Iraq pressure, so it was beliwed that he had fought a good fight in londm in the matter of Jin baud’s Blockade measures* xhe Bedouin world felt that their Shaikh had bean able to put forward fact, auc I'Turua in London, which would now pi'ove decislre irk Kuweit * s long drawn out efforts to find relief from the Blockade. This had a steadying effect all round. example of the state of nervous tension that had existed oiong the Bedouin, the following story may be of interest. On 9th apt saber, &amp; dispute arose in one of the large Beoouin encampments which exist at Jahara (20 miles from Kuwait) between Lhafir tribesmen (Beni Hussain) and .hammer (Abda). The dispute all arose out of X Hollar which a i hafiri owed to a Lhammari and which he refused to acknowledge A fight which ensued between the two men, gradually affected the many Aha fir and ^hammar elements camped at J&amp;hra till in the end a couple of hundred from either side flew at each other in regular ^Xrish Fair” style, fortunately only sticks and tent poles were used, but even so casualties were numerous and when the trouble was eventually stopped by the Deputy f' Kuler rushing four armed oars from Kuwait to Jahara, fully fifty men were laid out with various forms of head wounds. Lix of these were so serious as to necessitate the removal of the wounded men to the mission hospital in Kuwait. Twenty men from either side are now in gaol in Kuwait, end the Ruler on his return ordered that both the Dhafir aikl , i haariiar, should as a punishment pay '^ikat' to Kuwait, or leave the Ltate at once. Actually he has a right to take &lt; ikat from foreiga tribes, who elect to 'auauer* in the State but for politic* 1 reasons has not so far enforced this right. The Dhafir tribe is an Iraq one, and the Shamiar are subjects of Bin Baud. At the time of writing everything is normal once more.- 7 - » 0 ) iliere is nothing fresh to reportln the raatter of tribal looatione* //vH . 178.,-CTH One has amoh pleasure In recording the following very satisfactory case of a caravan fro* Sahara. (origin of goods Kuwait) being rounded up and captured by Iraq irregulars under i haikh Muttashar the son of AJemi Pr oh© as badun, assisted by Iraq Preventive Police on or about the Pnd e tember* Ihe incident gave great satisfaction to the liuriiwhen he liourd about it on his return froei Europe, and greatly en_ courage a one to hope tiiat at long last the Iraq Government have decided to adopt serious and fair measures to tackle the smuggling problem by the employment of Bedouin and police, working on the Iraq side of the frontier: The incident in question occurred on the southern shore of the simm&amp;r Lake in Iraq, between Ghabishiyeh and Aluwi ailway stations, and is briefly as follows: (Facts obtained from one of those who took part, and from an official « report furnished by the Deputy huler to the writer)** (a) A dump of sugar, coffee, tea and other minor articles, had be&amp;x secretly formed west of Sahara by a certain band of smugglers, and was at the end of i ugust moved forward across the Iraq frontier, by camels working in fours and fives, so as not to attract attention* (b) On the day selected for the venture the smugglers loaded up 200 canals (on the Iraq side of the front ier) formed a convoy and proceeded to the bouth end of the Haaar Lake where marsh men in 'tuas-hoofs* were in readiness to take the goods over* (o) The smugglers were a mixed lot, and consisted of .hammer, Dhafir, ashai da^anc rutair elements (the HasheIda being Kuwait subjects)* (d) The venture appears to have been a private one.- 3 - JL (e) I44y privet* one, and payment waa to ba by resulta.but If cargo waa captured the liedouin escort were not to bo held roaponslbio, .hen nearing the Hamer Lake the caravan broke up into two parties of 100 camels each. (f) The first party got as far as a place called .u&amp;anm -eld when it was suddenly fired upon by about 100 irregulars and desert Police assisted by a armoured oars tit is said). The surprise was ooaplet-;. The first party of camels and goods wore captured but the second party dropped their loads ana made off in the darkness. In other vrorde oargo was taken but only 96 camel*. (g) Rumour says that 5 of the aaugglera were killed in the first volley, but according to one of ths smugglers (a Mutairi) whom I secretly interviewed, one i ashidi only was killed 9 and hone were captured. (h) Of the captured canals 5 are said to have died of wounds anti 92 were brought to Zub&amp;ir end sold for to a merchant named 1 aahld al Hilhiau The latter who is supposed to be in with various smuggling organizations is reported to have secretly sold the camels back to their respective Bedouin owners and at cost price. According to reports of certain Kuwait merchants who recently returned from Bibai, shaikh cnid al Maktum of Dabal intends shortly visiting Iraq. The eerohants say that the shaikh of Abu Dhobi's recent visit to Iraq and that of Jh&amp;ikh ^aid are connected with Oil; that the a.i.O.C. have opened negotiations with them for Oil couo. ssion* , but the persons in question, thou$i favouring the A.I.O.B., aeslre to get into touch with other firms in Iraq in order that there should be healthy competition and give best results for L Y|- 9 - results for themselves. In this connection it i s Interesting to note that Lord Glenconner, a Director of Traders Ltd., and also of the B.G.I;. is shortly expected in Baghdad. v S the above stories may be gossip pure and simple, tney should be accepted with reserve. 180 »M%T£Q ^0GI CAL. -uixtrcuii.» terauerature 101 * the fortnight under review 108 F Minimum . * » . n n „ n /O.Ue - Lt.-Colonel, oliticai .gent, Kuwait.

During the period under review, the Shaikh has, by a series of telegrams and letters given news of his movements in the last half of August. It appears that from Beyrout, he proceeded to Jerusalem and Amman, at both of v/hich places he remained two or three days, i’rom Amman he went to Cairo on a 3 day visit and it is anticipated he will arrive back at Kuwait / by air on or about 7th September. v The Shaikh in his letters expressed his very deep gratitude for the kind reception which was given him by the British authorities in Palestine and also by K.H. the Amir Abdulla. The latter apparently conferred on the Shai-li a high Order, though exactly what this is has yet to be ascertained. COMLIEIIT. The decision of the ohaikh to see Damascus, Palestine, Amman and Bgypt i.e. important states o. the kin dle East, before he returned home, was in my opinion, a sound one for the following reasons (a)3 - / 48 . (a) He avoided the terrific August heat of Kuwait, which would have undone much of the good, from the health point of view, which his holiday has done him. (b) He will have seen the progress made by other Middle East Arab States, since the Great War be and this fact alone will/of the utmost value frcm an education point of view. 167.TRIBAL KEY/S AND LOCATIONS. (a) The Kuwait tribes appear to have become unaccountably nervous and restless, during the period under review. This I put down to the rumours which have almost daily been filtering in fran Riath, to the effect that Bin Saud, still smarting under what he calls the 'insulting' notes which he has received from His Majesty’s Government in the matter of the 5 armed men incident, continues to rage and publicly vow vengeance against Kuwait in almost every 'Mijliss' he attends. He is reported as having even hinted that it might be necessary soon to punish the Shaikh of Kuwait, by some form of raid or other into Kuwait territory, (this latter must be accepted with caution). (b) Unfortunately unwise and publicly expressed opinions of this kind have a way of reacting dangerously on excited admirers, as there is always the danger that a 'Thomas a Becket' incident may result. It is therefore doubly unfortunate that Bin Saud does not try and show some restraint of language, when discussing Kuwait affairs with his entourage in Riath. (c) Already some of the King’s remarks have fallen on good soil, and both Hamud al Bagaawi, and A1 Khuderi, the Saudi frontier Officers in charge of Blockade arrangements at Jarriya al Ilya and Hafar al Batin, have of late been holding meetings of Mutair and Harb leaders, expi-aining to them that the Shaikh of Kuwait is in the very bad books of the great King, and that the latter is looking about- 4 - looking about for means to punish him. That they (the tribal leaders) are one and all to look upon Kuwait as an enemy country, and must entirely understand that Kuwait is absolutely forbidden to them, and that the King means business this time. In this connection see note on the Kuwait Blockade situation as existing at the end of July, in para 140 (aj , '^b) ,(c) ,(d) ox xmwait Intelligence Summary No.12. (&amp;) It now appears certain that the large petrol 'dump” which was recently located at Jerriya Ilya, and which it was thought was for the use of American geologists, is a Blockade measure pure and simple, and is intended for the use of the extra Blockade cars that have been brought up to the Kuwait frontier (See para 141(e) of Kuwait Intelligence Summary No.12). CQMHSNT. (i) In the above connection it will be found interest ing to peruse para 125(d) of Kuwait Intelligence Summary No. 11, for the first half of July, also para 140 of Kuwait Summary No. 12 for the second half of July. In the former it was pointed out that Bin Saud r s 'third bite ' at Kuwait would take the form of his informing His Majesty’s Government that he proposed enforcing a complete ban on all forms of inter-communication between Nejd and Kuwait. In the second of these references it was clearly shown that by the end of July Bin Saud had in actual fact enforced this proposed Ban on people or trade coming from Kuwait without informing His Majesty’s Government. (ii) The above facts are worth mentioning as from telegram 144 dated 27th August, and again from telegram 153, dated 2nd September from H.M’s Charge' d f Affaires, Jedda to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (received as this goes to press), the Saudi Government would appear to be taking the line that, us n • 1 J I -as a result of a so called increase of smuggling from Kuwait into Nejd since the breakdown of the Conference, it proposed 'to enforce a ban on trade of every description from Kuwait to Nejd and to altogether forbid Kuwait Nationals from entering Saudi Arabia until such time as a proper understanding was arrived at with Kuwait' - when in actual reality this state of affairs was in existence by the end of July last as mentioned above and reported in para 140(b) of Kuwait Summary No.12. (iii) As regards Bin Saud’s latest accusation re increase of smuggling: The only recorded case of smuggling since the breakdown of the Conference is that mentioned in para 140(e) of Kuwait Summary No. 12, when a small party of Nejd Mutair were caught smuggling rice at Jarrab in Qasim on 18th July. The Saudi Government’s remarks on the subject are therefore^not quite true, and are clearly intended as 'food' only for His Majesty’s Government. (iv) The Saudi Government’s statement (Vide Jedda’s telegram 153 dated 2nd September 1935 quoted above) that they have been obliged to move forces froa Hail to the Kuwait frontier is on the other hand correct: (See para 140(c) and (d) of Kuwait Summary 12 for July), but this has been done purely to tighten up the already existing blockade, (See third bite), and is not as a result of increased smuggling. 168.RELATIONS KITH IRaQ,. There seems to have been a recrudescence of Baghdad propaganda against Kuwait judging fran certain articles which appeared in August in certain Iraq papers, also in a Palestinian journal supplied with news from Baghdad. As an example of what is meant one may quote the following:- (a) In the 'A1 BilaA' newspaper of Baghdad (No.618) under date 7th August 193b, there6 there appeared an article headed, 'Should Kuwait be united with Iraq'. (b) In the 'A1 Tariq' newspaper of Baghdad No.72 uated 27th August 1955 there appeared an eve worse article entitled, 'The annexation of Kuwait by Iraq, the 'neucleus of the aspired for Arab Union'. This areticle also appeared in a Damascus paper Note. 'Fata al Arab'. (c) The Jerusalem paper 'Falestine' under date 14th August 1955 published an article quoted as emanating from Baghdad called, 'The people of Kuwait aspire to be united with Iraq, but the British Government attempts to extend her protection over that country'. iill three articles are obviously inspired, and would appear to aim at (a) discrediting the Shaikh, (b) making l out that His Majesty's Government's policy is machiavellian in the extreme, and has for its final object the turning of the Arab maritime States into British Protectorates, (c) the appealing to the youth of Kuwait (and incidentally also other Arab states) to work for union with Iraq where they would be safe and not be under a foreign yoke. As may be supposed such articles do much harm, as no doubt they are intended to do. For they not only tend to undermine the authority of the Shaikh himself, but may be definitely said to be in the nature of anti-British propaganda. ^ full report on the matter has been submitted to Bushire 169.INTARFSTING STONY OF A DESBRT BSCAPB. (Repeated only lest the Saudi Government later lay the matter against Kuwait's door). Early/- 7 - Early in August a Nejd subject named oalman bin Jonathan an-Nasafi, of the Hashaida tribe proceeded with Bhaiich Trahib al Bhuqair of Jerriya to Eiyath with some presents for H.M.Aing Bin Baud* Having received a gift in return from the King, he left for Jerriya a few days later. On reaching the tf oahul rt country north of Riyath, he stole two camels, the property of some local Bedouin and resumed his journey. On arriving near the DIBDIBAH he was met by a couple of aI Bagaawi’s men (Frontier Blockade Officer), who interrogated him and finding him unable satisfactorily to account for the two camels he bad, they marched him to Al Bagaawi , who in turn put the man in irons and sent him to Bin Jaloui (Governor of Hassa) , under escort, ,/hen within a few miles of Hassa, the party, halted for a short rest in a cave and went to sleep. Salman thinking this a good opportunity to escape quietly got up, and taking the rifles and ammunition belonging to his escort, mounted his camel. Before making off he shouted and woke the men and warned them not to follow him, ss he was a desperate man and would shoot them down if they did. The men took the hint, and tried to follow at a safe distance. The fugitive Salman now made for Kuwait at break neck speed, and his pursuers losing the trail of their man, made for Jerriya, where they reported the incident to al Bagaawi. The latter reinforced the party and ordered them to follow as up the absconder as best^they could. The party proceeded to Kuwait with a letter for the Shaikh, searching along the whole route and on arrival they reported the whole matter to Shaikh Abdulla Salim, and applied for his assistance. The Shaikh gave orders for the party to make a thorough search among Kuwait tribes assisted by Kuwaiti i-idawis. the search failed and it was later discovered that the roan had left for Iraq after leaving the rifles and ammunition of his «jof his one time guards with a Rashidi woman, under promise that she should send them back to Jerriya. The man managed to net rid of his irons by means of a file vfhich the woman gave him. The Saudi party returned to Jerriya on 21.8*35. 170. METDORO LOGICAL.

One saaetimes seriously wonders whether the 'tide' will ever turn again in favour of the genuine article, seeing that the 'Culture' pearl has got such a hold of world markets. 151. DATE EXPORT SEASON ON 3HATT AL ARAB. (a) This seems to promise good things, if talks with Dhow owners convey* anything. Several Dhow and Baggala Captains with whom I have discussed matters assert that the threatened War between Italy and Abyssinia is going to run up the price of dates and teake export of that commodity to Berbers and Aden a paying proposition. (b) There is activity among the local everseas 'Date' trading merchants in consequence, and dhows are being fitted out hastily in the hope that good times are catting. Pearl divers are signing on as crews which is a new departure. (c) Both owners of Dhows and their Captains emphasize that no trade can or will be done with Eritrea or Italian Somaliland direct owing to the ill-treatment which Italian officials always mete out to Arabs, v/hat is hoped will happen is that if war breaks out, British strength in Somaliland will be increased, in which case there will be a great demand for dates among Somali levies, transport workers etc- etc. Also it is believed that Dates will flow frcm Berbers to Italian Somaliland to feed Italian local troops and irregulars. 152.

(b) Public opinion is of course entirely in favour of Abyssinia, and Italy is looked upon as a 'bully' pure and simple. (c) Men recall how Italy behaved, in her campaign against the ^anussi in North Africa, and in every 'Mijliss' and Tf diwan n , she is talked of as the Christian power who callously destroyed thousands of Arab homes round Tripoli, and now wants to possess rich Abyssinia simply because her people are black and backward, and she (Italy) wants to possess their rich highlands. (d) General dmutts recent speech in South Africa which was reproduced in Egyptian and Syrian papers, has been widely read aikL discussed in Kuwait. 153.SHAIKHS YIoIT JO INGLAND. (a) News has been received from His Excellency that he is (15th August) in Beyrout, having enjoyed a tour of the Lebanon and Damascus regions.

He is known to be anxious to see the Mosque of Omar, and pay a flying visit to the Amir Abdulla. (c) It is probable therefore that His Excellency will be back in Kuwait by the end of August. 154.SAUDI DELEGATION KQR BLOCKADE CQNFEKENCE. On 15th August the writer received a particularly cordial letter of thanks from Shaikh Hamad bin Sulaiman and Khalid ibn al Walid, leaders of the Saudi'iiafa 11 , thanking him, the Deputy Shaikh ol ioiwait and all the notables of the Town for their generous hospitality to them and their party whilst in Kuwait. The writerswriters declared that they had faithfully reported to His Majesty the truly overwhelming hospitality of the people of Kuwait, and that His Majesty had been particularly impressed and pleased with this gesture of friendliness. Suitable letters were returned by the writer and the Deputy Ruler, independently. 155. RIYAIH AKD NRJD NE./S. (a) Nothing of interest to report. (b) The Blockade of Kuwait is being maintained with the increased severity reported in para 140 of Summary No.12. (c) A surprising number of Nejd and Kuwait merchants have been purchasing mares frcm Iraq during the last month, it is said, for presentation to Bin saud. Some of the animals it seems went direct from Zubair to Riyath via Jahara, and others w are now in Kuwait waiting cooler weather before they go on. (d) This move of horseflesh frcm Iraq to Nejd is not on a large enough scale to merit an&amp; particular atten tion, and is probably merely being worked by certain indi viduals who are out to gain the King's approbation, and get a nice reward in return.For example a man buys a mare for Rs. 180/- in Iraq(Amar&amp; district is popular) and delivers it in Riyath for another Rs.30/-. The mare is then presented to His Majesty, who probbbly gives the donor a present of Rs. 250/- par animal. A profit of Rs.40/- is thus made per each mare. This is considered very good business indeed among pool* Kuwaitis and still poorer Nejd tribesmen. 156. RA.SR A AND IRAQ. NRffS.

As regards (o) above the writer has arranged to send 4 of the camel claimants with letters to the Mutasarrifsof Diwaniyeh and Kerbela Liwas, asking if every assistance could be given to the men in helping them recover their lost property.

The Deputy Ruler affirms that in all his life, he has not known such unpleasant heat.

The Shaikh’s description of how he had been summoned to a Conference of High Foreign Office and India Office officials at which were discussed various Kuwait problems was most instructive, and was particulariy welcomed by ifce people of Kuwait. They felt that at long last Kuwait’s point of view was being properly put forward In person by their Guler, which belief meant much more to them then appeared on the surface. For the people of Kuwait have felt very keenly of late the growing hostility of Iraq and what appears to be that country’s firm determination to acquire the prtncipelity by fair means or foul; and have felt that His Majesty’a Government have never yet properly understood the ©itren^ely clever methods used by the Iraqi politicians to bring this about. The shaikh’s description to his people of his audience with H.M. the King w Kmperor was also vivid eveneven if somewliat highly coloured. 'Big following are seme of the expressions used by him in his letter (a) 'His Liajesty the King seeraed to know all about our troubles, and in a half hour audience during which he was graciousness itself, promised me his personal help and assistance, ana told me to rest assured that everything would caae right'. (b) 'Kalftt al Kuluk, idaluk al Kalam’* (The word of a King is the King of words) • (c) 'Hakhud Kalpiaah raithl al Xmtha' (X accept his word as I would his seal). (d) 'i&gt;ahih yistahil al laaialnka’* (Yerily he is worthy of the great ilapiro he rules over). 'The shaikh left London on 27th July for i aris, from wliere he hoped to go direct to Aleppo, Kama ecus, Beyrout (and perlmps Transjordan), after which he said he would return via the trans-desert route via Baghdad ana Basra. He expected he said, to reach Kuwait about 16th august.

It seems that when Bin baud’s delegates left ..uwait to servants and drivers nought up the whole party downbought up several thousands of rupees worth of contraband articles for the purpose of snuggling them into Kiath* Unfortunately Bsmud al Bagaawi, the King’s Blockade Officer at Jerriya Ilya insisted on examining everyone’s baggage. Finding the contraband goods (which included such articles as radio sets, gramophones, records, scents and articles of clothing) he politely said that he would not confiscate s&amp;ue (as was his ri^it) seeing that they were owned by such a distinguished party, but would merely report to the King and give him a list of what he had found. He was as good as his word, and according to reports the Great King’s wrath was 41 wondrous to behold* 'Fortunately the three leaders of the ,afd ♦Khalid ibn al Walld*) had taken the precaution to send their own Hamad al Suleiman* ) Abdullah al Qosaibl* ) contraband articles round by sea to Bahrain and Jadda, respectively, and so were able to plead w not guilty*, but tbe 80 rank and file got into most serious trouble and many are now languishing in prison* (b) The vVafd* s few days halt at Jerriya (reported in para 124(b) of summary No,11) turned out to be due to Al Bagaawi’s thorough search of all the party’s baggage* He spun out the agony, for 4 days* 140.

The trouble in Nejran, has during the period undor review been reported so often by Bedouins frcm the it interior that, I think now one must accept as having sane foundation in fact. (b) The most circumstantial story was brought to Kuwait on 51st July, by a special ^audian messenger who was en route to Iraq, with letters frcre Bin aaud to the Hamida family i .e. Shaikh Naif al Kama id and party, of whom more later. The messenger told me as a close secret, that the true story about Nejran was as follows:- 'Bin £aud v s original garrison in Nejran consisting d some 70 men had been cut up and destroyed as a result of ill-treatment of the Bani Yam tribe by the Saudi Amir. A second party 'darriya', which had proceeded to Nejran to gat news was disarmed and sent home to Kbha, since which Nejren has been in revolt. Bin ^aud had intended marching down a force to punish the lead ers, had postponed action till the weather beoame cobler. That certain senior members of the Royal Fami-K/ aud strongly advised the King to let Nejran go for good, as it would only oat up the strength oi cho oentral emssent, like a oanoer, if ti** King persisted in trying to keep it (o)/ under his control”- 7 - Ae 0 result of the incident at Dah&amp;l ^bu Jamb, whan e . .uutii i,ar patrol murdered a party of 5 liutalr tribesman and a merchant eBOeplng frcm • asim (See para 125(e)(3) of yummary Wo.ll) after they had been given safe conduct and had surrendered, the 3&lt;ln3 disalssed sh»n-&gt;. Mubarak; ibn Bayrlch, Gknrernor of Burnide, and sent ibn Musa’ad to mlza to severely oenaure ths /iBiir Ibn -ulsim of that T^wn. (d) Reports have come in from Riynth that fpan now onwards the Indian Rup ?e as well as the Maria Theresa dollar will be the official currency of baud! rrabis* (e) Reliable news from Jerriyu al Ilya, (the first little township on the Kuwei t-Riyath road) shows that the King is putting down a large and i port ant duup of petrol there. By the 18th July *e- two convoys of 57 camels and 48 camels respectively (each carrying 4 tins of petrol) had arrived, and at the motaant of writing a further convoy of 70 camels is reported to have ootue in.(Latter has to be confirmed). More tins are to follow, it is said. It is not Known what this supply is intended for, but it probably is for the use of the iiaarioan Oil geologists when they return with the cold weather. On the other hand the petrol may be intended for the iiuwai t-Riyath Mecca pilgrim traffic, a route which both the Lhaiich of Kuwait and Bin Laud are keen on encouraging. (f) A further serious water quarrel - this time it was a question of water right* to the -*LL Haba wells in the Mutair country - broke out on 18th July between the 'Al Maflid' section of the Duahan (ilutair) and the 'Al r ohemed' section. As a result both shaikh Hazza al Ladr, and iibdul Aziz al Majid and his brother Laud, were hailed before the King in Biyath. As Shaikh Hazza talked rather too boldly before His Majesty,he was cast into prison, where he remains. The wells actually are 'common' to both sections, and no oihj know ig ' ! k/3ttei- 8 - this better then Bln Sa«d« Both partleo are ?ell kao^to the writer. * (■0^,1]^. These regular and frequent 'clashes' In the Mutair country show that th^i tribe is the reverse of 'happy' these days. Dissatisfaction exists every where according to reports and it all arises from Bin jaud Y s Blockade of Kuwait. The Mutair are expected to go to $draway Hoffuf for the! * supplies t when Kuwait is so to speak next door to them. It la against human nature to do so and Bin Baud will yet have trouble with this great confederation if he does not adopt a more lenient policy or at leavct wink at smuggling when it is a l+v case of Mutairjbringing out supplies from Kjwtflt. AiamY ca WM? ra ™ vis (a) During the month of July Bin .-Jaud was once more very active in this matter and sent many letters to those A Jinan Shaikhs who are still afraid to return to Kejd.^very letter offered full 'Amnesty r and 'safe conduct'. Recent departures for Riyath to take advantage of this amnesty, have been as followss- (a) Shaikh ^alim el Uthain, (h) .ihaikh -uiaisan al llunaikhir. Both are personal friends of mine and were advised to go back by me. (b) Before deciding on anything the above shaikhs together with Mohamad ibn Uthain, and Abdulla ibn Mikhyal (the slayer of JTahad bin Jiloui in 1239) called to consult me as to whether it would be safe to trust the King , s word or not. My advice was in the affirmative* hat appeared to worry the party greatly was the present day reputation ot the King and his frequent acts of treachery.iUlMohaiRed al Uthain put it, 'Bin Baud used to be quite different Inin his dealings with us Bedouin. H« treated us as his child ren and punished us when we went wrong, with suitable imprisonment. More often than not he forgave us and sent us home with gifts. He literally was our father es well as our King. ^11 this was in the old days. Today, however, Bin Saua still does give gifts to favourites, but deals ou t death all round on the flimsiest of pretexts, and allows his underlings, and junior officials to execute and maim and practise dreadful cruelty without any form of trial at all* This 01 Col.Dickson is what is turning the hearts of all raon against tho King and what mafcea us afraid to go back. se may be friends today and in our graves tomorrow. Bln ^aud is a changed man since the attempt on his life and he today resemblos his grandfather ?AIsaL the Great. The letter become a cruel savage and despotic tyrant before he died, and our present King seems to be following in his footsteps*. f b) As mentioned above, a ^audian messenger passed throug Kuwait on Slst July with letters fraa Bin Kaud to f^ham ftaif al Humald n paramount ha itch of ^talba_fend \ohained al Humaid and Hindi al iium&amp;id his cousins, all three 01 whoui are voluntary exiles in Iraq and receive pay from the Iraq King. Bin Baud offered them full amnesty and free safe conduct if they would return home, another they will accept the King’s offer or not remains to *&gt;© soon. 1 personally doubt dhaikh Half loins so in face of the last treacherous attempt to get him at ^afwan in ■ttuaihMT. m* latest effort to got Uolfi of Naif bin Huineiu is important in vie* of the internal condition of Arabia, ohalich Waif is the paramo ant Chief of all the ataiba in spite of ibn Habaiyan. US./UQ.iiZLu'nom ITH IRAw., (a) No visible steps have yet been taken by Iraq to establish an effective customs cordon on tl»ir side of the Kuwait Iraq frontier. This is to be regretted in face of para 4 of Foreign Office, London’s telegram 175. (b) rhe Fao customs launch, has once again, after the lapse of some months, started entering Kuwait territorial water* and searching Kuwait sailing craft in for supposed contraband. The launch is said to have been clearly seen working close to Maschan Island at the entrance to the Bay of Kuwait 3 times in June, but as information of the fact was only sent in to the Kuwait Goveraaent in July, the Shaikh rightly decided to ignore the incidents. However on 5th July, the launch was again seen by the ligit-keeper on Maschan Island and 4 other witnesses. This time it emerged from the Jabbiyeh estuary (an essentially Kuwait inlet) and after spending the whole day in close vicinity to Maschan Iwsland, during which it held up several boats as they came out of Kuwait, it left for Fao. According to the light-keeper whose evidence the writer took in person, the launch anchored close in to M&amp;schan and circled the Island twice. HsK. the shaikh has officially protested against this fourth violation of Kuwait waters, and a full report has been sent in of the incident. It is hoped in the interest of good relations that the Iraq Gorermnent will take disciplinary action against the Captain of the Launch. (c) On 83rd July, the Jhaikh was informed by Mr.Gabriel, his lawyer estate Agent in Basra, that th© aut&amp;sarrif had made an official written denand for the eum of I.D.7500/- belng old 'taxation due'. It wae said, frora the ihalkh'a gardens In the Fao Nahlya. A* It wae not made clear what this fresh demand for taxation represented, the Shaikh was adrlsed by the writer to get his lawyer to enquire officially&lt;1 Yvvtf' * ! of r icially from the Mutaaarrif as to hem exactly the demand had been arrived at. P'urthermore, as the Shaikh* s gardens are free from all 'taxation' under His tojesty’s Oovemaant* s guarantee 1914 # the Shaikh was also advised to resist the demand until reference had been made to His majesty*s Government. A full report has been made to Bushire, of this surprising now attempt to 'get at' the shaikh - more especially as H.3. tfuri Pasha on his recent visit to London promised that as soon as he returned to Iraq he would set about the question of seriously getting the Iraq Government to confirm the Shaikh’s 'title' to the 5 properties on the Sh&amp;tt al iirab 9 exempted by His Majesty’s Government from taxation for ever in 1914. It’ is not without significance that Nuri lasha was in Basra in the latter part of July, and just about the time when the Mutasarrlf sent in this fresh demand. 144 . ABYo^IU IA ITalff LlJPim. (a) Great interest is being taken in Kuwait over this matter, and as in Biyath, public opinion seems to be all in favour of Abyssinia. (b) The general view is t£at there will be no war, as British pressure on Italy will be too much for her in the long run. (c) England’s championing of Abyssinia in such vigorous manner has run 'British stock up' in astonishing manner. CQMKSNT. This of course is all to the good. No doubt the local population see in themselves a small Abyssinia, and in Iraq another Italy. Lt.-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait. Political Agency, Kuwait. The 5th August 1935.

On 14th July the Political Agent proceeded to Basra to see Mrs. Dickson off by train to the United Kingdom. He returned on the 15th July. On his return journey he took the opportunity of having a friendly talk with the Commandant of the Police Post at Safwan . regarding the number of Bedouins camped at Safwan . and also these at Urn Nica in Kuwait territory just over the border. He learned that the Timiat section of the Shmmar had been ordered by the IRAQ, authorities to move to Chabda south of the Hamar lakeHamar lake* This act of co-operation on the part of the IRA^ authorities has been much appreciated in Kuwait, for the Timiat were mainly instrumental in the raids reported in para 100 of Summary No. 9. 122. TRIBAL NE.7S AND LOCATIONS . Nothing to report, except that the writer has been kept very busy trying to recover stolen camels, through the IRAQ authorities in Basra, see para 113 of Kuwait Intelligence Summary No# 10. 123# Y/EATHBR CONDITIONS . The annually welcome t, Bareh M or 40 days North West breeze, which started blowing on 17th June and blew irregularly up to the end of June, gained in strength and regularity from 1st July till 10th July, made things generally much pleasanter A to bear than the first part of June. Unfortunatley the wind increased in strength on that date and ended in an really bad dust storm, which continued to scourge Kuwait and blind us all up to the 16th July (date of writing this). For six days life was made miserable, and so heavy and thick was the fog caused by the dust, that shipping was delayed everywhere and East and Wes-bound Air Liners ceased functioning. The appalling and dust was accompanied by a burning hot wind,^conditions of life have been difficult to endfcre# 124# SAUDI DKLffttATION FOR BLOCKADE CONFERENCE . (a) Reference para 112(9) of Kuwait Intelligence Summary No. 10. As anticipated the Saudi-Kuwait Blockade Conference finally broke down on 30th June, and the Saudi Delegates left Kuwait on 5th July, having been delayed by damaged cars and the non arrival of spare parts from Baghdad and Karachi. (b) The delegates left the town at sundown and proceeded to Jariya- 3 - to Jarlya Ilya, where,curiously enough, it is reported that they camped several days there. According to Bedouin reports (received 15th July) they were still tnere on 10th July, though the story lacks confirmation. (o) In the light of subsequent events, it seems quite ^■lear now that Bin Baud intended the Conference to fail from the first, and was not slow to seize upon H.M. Government’s protest in the matter of the violation of the Kuwait frontier by Ibn Jaloui’s six henchmen on 6th May (See para 87 of Kuwait Summary No. ’8)v The excuse wherewith to justify to his people his offer of impossible terms to Kuwait. (d) The Saudi delegates dined officially at the Agency on 29th June, the principal other guest being His -^cellency the Acting Ruler. The dinner passed off pleasantly, and the guests were kept amused by the very talkative Shaikh Khalid ibn al Walid, who with refreshing candour retailed many of his ex- s periences in Italy, Moscow, Turkey and Tripoli (North Africa). Shaikh Khalid apparently went to Moscow on the staff of Enver Pasha, imnediately before the latter* s abortive rebellion and death in Turkestan. He professed to have met the Bolshevic leaders Kara Khan, Tchiofterin, Kalenin and others and talked cheerfully and freely.- (1) of the steady rise of Arab Nationalism in the world, and hinted strongly that H.M* s Government should not ignore this, but rather cultivate and sympathize with it, as in the x end it would be better for her to be in the position of friend and guide to the final one Arab Nation,than its enemy. (2) of H.M. Government’s policy with Bin Saud and that her obvious policy should be to give him a much more free hand where the Arab States in the Persian Gulf were concerned. (3) of his personal friendship with Mr. Philby, who whilst being one of the greatest and most knowledg eable Englishmen where matters Arabia were concerned, was curiously enough one of the most ignorant of all people where Arab Psychology, Arab pride and Bedouin manner and customs were concerned.mm ^ mm (4) of the late Colonel Lawrence, who he described as one of those who had T *the luck', among many * other equally good men,and should be called the 'Romancer in Chief of the Great War'* (5) of the Imam Yahya, who was deeply and genuinely religous and must be absolved of all connection with the recent attempted assasination of the King - not so his son. That Yahya feared above all things, the slow percolation into Yemen of the simple beliefs of the Wahabis, for he knew that if once his people really learned about them, they would discard the old fashioned Zeidi doctrine, overturn their ruler and join up with Bin Baud. (6) of Arabs generally,who he divided in three classes the really educated , the half educated and the Bedouin . The first and last were about equal in nobility of thought and act and were well worthy of cultivation by Englisbmaa in general and H.M. Government in particular - The 'Half baked' or 'Semi educated' were bad to the core, especially the present generation - There children would be different he hoped. (7) of the difference between English, French, German and Turkish philosophy and psychology - That the A to Z of a good and successful ruler was to study and study again the Psychology of his people! and the neighbouring nations he had to deal with- Such was Bin Saud and that summed up the whole strength of that remarkable man. 125. RIYATH AND HSJD NEWS . (a) For the last 15 days there have been persistent rumours among the Bedouins that things have again not been going too well in the direction of Yemen; and that Bin Saud was once more contemplating forces to Asir and Nejran . (b) On 14th July a Mutair Bedouin came in from Artawiyeh with the positive story that the people of Ne.iran had revolted against the local Saudi Amir, because of cruel treatment, ihat they had seized him and his force of 70 men, and after disarming them had sent them home* (o) The same day another kutair tribesman, this time from Riyath . brought the news that the Saudi Amir of Nejran had angered the Nejran people by his treatment of certain women. That on their protesting, he, the Amir, had treacherously invited certain leaders to a dinner party and then arrested them allthem all. That tMs act had so maddened the Nejranis that they arose en masse surrounded and captured the Amir, and his 'Saniya 1 (force) and after releasing their f riends had driven him out of Nejran. (d) As opposed to the above rumours pure and simply it i s confirmed that Bin Saud recently ordered Ibn Musai^is and Ibn Migiad, his nominees over the Mutair tribe, to repair to Riyath with various other leaders, and is treating them with more than usual honour. (e) The inviting to the Capital of these Mutair leaders, may possibly signify a coming 'call' for recruits for Nejran . but it is more likely to concern various Mutair internal feuds and troubles which have recently been causing anxiety to the King. For instance.- (1) It is known that Ibn Musaigis and Ibn Miziad recently had a serious quarrel over water rights and in a fight which aasued, several persons were killed. (2) The Braih section of Mutair are excited and highly resentful at the King’s recent action in ordering them south from Hafar al Batin (their ancestral wells), and settling Shammar and Anaze for the summer on them. (3) The murdering of a Nejd merchant and five Mutair tribesmen by a Saudi patrol in the Summan after they had given them 'Aman' or 'Safe conduct'. This latter incident has upset the whole tribal fabric against Saji the Central Government. Briefly the incident was as follows, a Nejd merchant of one of the towns of Qasim, was accused of having smuggled goods from Kuwait on the strength of a camel load of contraband 'stuff' having been found outside his front door, in the street - In vain he protested that enemy had deposited the articles to get him into trouble. Realising from tiie progress of the enquiry, that things looked bad for him, he collected what money he had and secretly bolted for Kuwait^ accompanied by 5 Mutairi guards. He was inter cepted by a patrol in cars and ordered to surrender •• Instead he and his party fought the^^ for 12 hours* When night fell the Patrol Com mander offered the party 'aman' and 'safe conduct' to go where they wished if they would surrender. The offer was accepted, but no sooner did the party hand over their rifles,then they were fill set upon and shot dead. COMMENT , (a) As important events in Arabia are frequently pre ceded by a crop of Bedoin stories such as the above, the writer- 6 v. * writer considers that something may be in the wind. (b) The sumnoning of the Mutair leaders, may on the other hand pressage a yet more severe tightening up of the Blockade of Kuwait, as a result of H.M. Governments recent 'protest' connected with the violation of the Kuwait frontier, on 6th Mav official J (c) The King*s/reply to H.M. Governments above mentioned 'protest', was significant and was to the effect that if H.M. Government considered the act of the 5 men, who crossed the Kuwait frontier and ordered people about,to have been such a heinous affair, then there was nothing left but to forbid all goings and comings between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Such action in effect, would mean the 'tightening up of the existing Bloci«le ,, to an unheard of extent and turn a trade Blockade into a siege. Needless to say the operation would not be practical politics and obviously is in the nature of bluff- (d) I think we may be certain of one thing - Bin Saud is greatly annoyed with H.M. Government over the 'protest' lyugfiiQss *' can be counted to try and to get his own back — He cannot push H.M. Government, so he will endeavour to 'bite” Kuwait instead, as that would in itself be tentambunt to hurting H.M. Government. In actual fact he Imows full well that/Kuwaith complaint to H.M. Government about the 5 men crossing the border was quite mildly put and was a Just complaint. The fact that H.M. Govemment took the matter up, howeveriji is what counts, Lt hurt his 'amour propre'. rile first 'bita' at Kuwait was made when 83 men were sent as escort etc to the Saudi delegation. The second 'bit.e^, was the ordering of his delegates to ask impossible demands of Kuwait, the third 'bite' will probably take the form of asking for a complete ban on intercommunication between Nejd and Kumit. 126. SHAIKH OF KUWAIT'S VISIT TO LONDON ill(1) News has just come through by air (15.7*35) that His Excellency the Shaikh is staying in London at Hans Crecent Hotel Knight sbridge. (2) Several of the leading notables of Kuwait have been to enquire frcm me lately if their ruler has been honourably received tBxLnitaai by the British Government in London. They know, they said, from the papers that the Amir Baud is being made a great 'fuss M of, and for the sake of Kuwaiti honour and good name they would like to read that their own Shaikh was also having a bit of w fuss w made of him. It may not be realized at home that the Amir Saud in Kuwait is looked upon as sort of son to Shaikh Ahmad, and is addressed as such by the latter in letters and conversation. In the same way the Shaikh of Kuwait always calls himself the young, brother of Bin Saud. I have been at pains to tell my questioners that the Shaikh of Kuwait is on a 'private' visit, whilst Amir Saud is a guest of the British Government. This reply does not entirely satisfy however. (3) Some of the more unsophisticated of the people of Kuwait, especially the Bedouin^suspect that the Shaikh has been ordered to London by H.M. Governmeit and may be imprisoned there never to ccme back. Thetr frequent enquiries as to his health and when he will return are very persistent and not a little pathetic. Such is the suspicion and distrust which exists for all governments in Arabia and one must confess that years of Turkish rule, and the treacherous acts of^present day Saudi and IRAQ officials, have given just cause for 1hem to think badly of those who try and rule them. 127. RECENT SUQ-BSH-SHIJYHKH REBELLION . Stories are daily coming in from tie Euphrates as tS&gt; events leadingleading at to the Rumaltha and Sua^ash-Shuzuk^disenders and the subsequent putting down of the trouble by the Iraq Governmetf The best account so far received have bean from individual Mutaij Ajman and Shammar Shaikhs, some of whom hoping for a chance of loot, secretly moved up close to SuQ-Ssh-Shuvn*h to be handy, foi the fun, should the Government troops have been worsted. A curious and common feature of the stories retailed, has been the rather libelous accusation that Suq-ash-Shuvukh wag occupied by the Government forces by an act of treachery. This apparently took the form of high Government officials promising the Hatoham tribesmen in occupation of the town, a general amnesty and complete forgiveness , if they would evacuate the town, retire to their houses and once again return to the cultivation of theii lands. It is said that the promise was given in writing and that the rebels accepted the conditions, but that as soon as they evacuated the town and the government forces arrived and took possession, the latter proceeded to fortify the place and using it as a base, started relentless mr operations against thbse — to whom they had promised amnesty* s* COMMENT &gt; The above story is mentioned for what it is worth, but it might be worthwhile for the IRAQ Government to deny this story of treachery before the report gets too widely defused in the Desert* 128. CONSCRIPTION IN IRAQ. * From IRAQ Bedouin reports, it would appear that the Baghdad Central Government believes that the time is now ripe (seeing that the Euphrates rebellion has been so successfully put down) to introduce the'Conscription Law' among the cities and tribes of IRAQ. It is said that £he registration of names of th«se marked for military duty is going on merrily in the towns but not so among the tribes. The general feeling among the latter is said to be one ofone of deep resentment, and further trouble is prophesied. 129® SMUGGLING FROM KUWAIT TO IRACj i. The recent primitive operations against the Euphrates tribes ha«Lresulted in a parked falling off in the number of IRAQI tribesmen to be seen in Kuwait. This should mean that 'smuggling' from Kuwait to the Euphrates is now not the popular pastime as it was. This is all to the good, but one still hopes to see an effort being made by the IRAQ authorities to guard their frontier, by means of police posts, blockhouses or car patrols. None of these exist though the opportunity to do something should not be missed now, when ttie Euphrates tribes are down and out® 130® METEOROLOGICAL .

AFTER NOTEafternote. (a) Sua-Esh-Shuyukh (Euphrates), Reports received on 16tli July from, the Euphrates area (source Dhafir Bedouin) tend to show that the trouble there has been scotched only, and has not been definitely crushed. Appa rently the Hatcham tribe, the ring Readers in the recent rebellion have up to date refused to submit, and none of their leaders have as yet come in* No doubt H.M’s Embassy in Baghdad is aware of the true facts* (b) Nejd Shammar and Ne.id Dhafir Sections at SubAhiyAh. It is reliably reported that Shaikh Mishal al Timiat and Ajemi as Suwait, who were ordered to evacuate Subahiyeh and proceed south by Ibn Jaloui (see violation of Frontier incident of 6th May) have notified their intention of proceeding to the Kuwait Neutral Zone, with their camels and sheep, and there paying them annual Zikat to Bin Saud. They have informed Bin Saud of their above intention and have asked that Tax collectors be sent to count their animals and receive the Zikat. They further told Bin Saud that their tents and families would remain at Subahiyeh . and after paying Zikat they would bring their sheep and camels back to Subahiyeh and remain their till the end of summer. The above move is obviously due to fear lest Bin Baud 'cut' the allowances which these Shaikhs receive from him* (o) The late Shaikh 111 al Shlwalrbat of the Smx Bralh Section of irtutair. Beference para 61 of Kumit Intelligence Summary No.6 for April last. It has now been proved that the unfortunate wife of the Shaikh was duly killed by the deceased Shaikh’s brother for her supposed part in the ’’witchcraft' business. Apparently she fearing the worst took refuge with the Saudi CommanderCcanmander of the Blockade force stationed at Ha far al Batin , and pitched her tent close to his, (a sign that she was under his protection) - This did not help her for the murderer got in by night, removed Ali bin Shiwairbat’s child from her arms while she was still sleeping, and stabbed her to death: The murderer was later caught and sent under guard to Bin Jalaoui: trU It is^hoped he will get his deserts there. The incident has caused a stir among the Wasil sections of the Mutair, as the girl was highly connected, and all reasonable men knew she was innocento (d) Find of a remarkable pearl . June Early in five poor divers,working alone discovered a remarkable pearl weighing over 500 'Chaws”, close in shore opposite Shaiba village (30 miles south of Kuwait) - The pearl is said to be the largest ever found in the Persian Gulf, and prominent pearl dealers in Kuwait have stated this as a fact to the writer. The pearl was purchased by His Excellency the Shaikh, who has taken it to London, with the intention it is said of presenting it to Her Majesty the Queen. The pearl which was shown to the writer, was of remarkable size and purity, its only fault being that it was slightly ’golden in colour instead of being of the popular 'rosy” hue. The lucky finders* fortunes have been made, and the poor fellows deserve it, for they were perhaps the most poverty stricken of all Kuwait's diving fraternity-1(3 fat - y U) 'A .

I Proceeded I dtmnamely that as they were anxious to reopen trade with '^asim and Ne.jd , and were willing and anxious to pay full Customs duty on all goods going into Ne.id . the Saudi G-ovemment should, for their part, agree to have one or more Customs losts on the frontier to take such Customs duty, and that Kuwait should allow no caravan bound for Ne.j d to leave the city, unless armed with a manifest showing the amount of goods it carried. That a duplicate of this manifest would be sent by Kuwait to the Saudi )\j Government through A1 Nafisi, and that third copy be kept in Kuwait for record. That the above system would insure all caravans going to the Saudi Customs posts and paying Customs duty. ( 6 ) The Saudi Delegates in reply laid it down as a necessary preliminary to be opening of any discussions, that the Kuwait Governmaat should agree to give a written document 'guaranting” that in the event of the Customs and Manifest $ System being introduce d tf all smuggling 'across the Saudi frontier should cease. (7) »7hen asked to define what was meant by tf all ”smuggling '3 and how failure to enforce 'guarantee' would be treated, the Saudi delegates stated that by 'all smuggling', was meant even ' an individual smuggler ' and that the Saudi Government would probably let Kuwait off with a caution for the first three cases of smuggling brought to their notice, but farther fourth case, even if committed by a single individual , the Saudi Government would cancel any agreement arrived at, and revert to the Blockade. ( 8 ) The Kuwait delegates pointed out that they naturally could not agree to such an absurd condition , and countered by promising that 'Kuwait would give her word of honour to do her best to stop all smuggling into Kejd, and would punish drastically4- drastioally all smugglers caught on the Kuwait side of the border 1 *, and that thoy hoped this would satisfy. i9) Up to the time of writing this Summary, there is no sign whatever that the Saudi Delegates Intend to modify their conditions, and from the various conversations that have taken place, it is pretty obvious that they have no desire that any agreement should succeed, and probably started out frcm Hoffuf with the deliberate intention of causing the Conference to fail. (10) The writer under orders from H.M. Grovernment attended all discussions* Tfcis was a good move as it enabled him to note down and record full notes of the proceedings. (These latter have been embodied in a separate report and have been submitted to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. COMMENTS. (a) From the haughty and overbearing attitude displayed by the Saudi Delegates at all meetings, it was early evident that they (the delegates) felt that they had the whip hand completely of Kuwait, and meant to show it. (b) Throughout the discussions the Saudi Delegates adopted the following uncompromising role rt The Blockade suits us down to the ground, our trade is benefiting at the expense of Kuwait, that is good business - We are keeping within the law - that also is good policy, as H.M. Government, your protector, cannot get at us - You are like a man in prison, if you offer us enough money we will let you out - Make it worth our while, and we will raise the Blockade tt . (o) To my mind one sided conferences of the above nature are more than useless and only tend to still further embitter relations. Certainly Kuwait is highly indignant already at the patronizing way in which her delegates have been so far treated. (d) I should also like to record my belief (though I say this with all due deference and fullest apology, seeing that what I say concerns Bahrain, a place outside my control) that the only ultimate way of bringing Bin Saud f s Blockade of Kuwait to an end, is to hurt or threaten to hurt him elsewhere - This can in my opinion best be done in the Persian Gulf, and by (i) Allowing Bahrain to impose full Bahrain duty on all goods in transit to Nejd . (ii) Allowing Bahrain to take full duty on cargo trans fers d into dhows from steamers if latter are in Bahrain waters. (iii)5 (iii) Making it impossible for steamers to short circuit Bahrain and go direct to the port ^Ras Tanura on the mainland. ^ The first and second suggestion should I think be welcomed by Bahrain (though I am entirely open to correo tion) , the third H.M. Government ought to be able to arrange with Shipping Companies. Probably only a small portion of Bahrain trade would be adversely effected, but Bin Saud would certainly become far more accommodating and reasonable ?/here Kuwait was concerned. 113.

(a) The measures taken by Kuwait to counter the activities of raiders and camel thieves from IRii.^Jfi have been most sucessful. Ho doubt also the IRA u Government have to be thanked for their assistance in tightening up of things at Safwan . There remains the now the recovery of/camels stolen frem the Kuwait tribes some 60 in number (b) I have already addressed th^Mutasarrif Basra regarding certain of the stolen camels that have been traced to Safwan , and shall deal with the other cases as they come up, in co- operation with the Mutasarrif. (c) Kuwait for her part continues to do her best to play fair by IRA^, and on 19th June brought off a pretty bit of recovery of IRA^ camels, which had been raided and brought into Kuwait by Dhafir Ujemi as Suwaitfs men) camped at Subahiyeh. Both raiders and raided were Dhaxir and ohe injured party was Shaikh Jali ibn Jurraiyid - ^jemi’s party it seems t, lifted ,f 40 camels from Jali’s camp in IRK^ and Jali straight way following them up lodged complaint with the Shaikh Ox Kuwait. The latter not only recovered the camels and handed them over to Shaikh Jali and his companions, but ordered the whole raiding party out of Kuwait State with the^families after fining them. A severe punishment during the intense summer \- 6 - summer heat. ;d./ ---is swixt^oi juotice has had a most steadying effect all round. The actual tf I.Iotif ff underlying the raid was vengeance for a past wrong connected with a woman, and need not be described here* 114. SIl^IxxH Q? VTolT TO LONDON . (1) His excellency the ehaikh left for London on 24th June. He travelled via Mosul and Taurus Express and Istanbul. (2) As there was some difficulty about tickets on the Orient Express, the Shaikh decided to break journey for one night at Istanbul. (3) In Baghdad the Shaikh was met by an official sent especially by H.M. King Ghazi^also by the Saudi Minister. In accordance with his private wish he was allowed // to go to the Maude hotel but only as the personal guest of the King: This gracious and generous gesture on the part of the King was very gratefully appreciated, by the Shaikh, who wrote and told me all about it from Baghdad. (4) Another gesture, this time on the part of the French Charge D’Affairs, also overwhelmed the mhaikh with gratitude. Apparently the Charge D’-rnffairs wrote and gave the Shaikh a truly striking letter of recommendation to the Syrian authorities and to all officials in French mandated territories, to do all in their power to make the Shaikh^s passage through Syria a pleasant and enjoyable one and included instructions to Customs, Police and other officers. 115.

UMRSST AMONG BEDOUINS OF THE IBAa SOUTHERN DBSERT, AND nAi'ir.^n 017 raids INTO KU./AIT FROM IRA^. f2^JJbi05 - dita]TTor _ theTenefrt of H.M’s iSmbassy Baghdad (a) Tbe recent disturbances on the Euphrates and the reported withdrawal of garrisons from certain posts in the southern IRA&lt;^ Desert has had the inevitable disturbing effect on the Bedouin world. The cry has gone up that there is no longer a 'Hakuma' in IRAQ, and that the good old days have once more arrived, when every man’s hand is against his neighbour, and everyone hopes to gain camels at the expense of the weak. The result3 The result is that raids and counter raids by small parties have everywhere become the fashion and widespread deterioration would appear to have set in. (b) The following is an example of what is happening and how the disease is spread. 'A certain Chief of the Dhafir (A1 Suwait family) arrived at Subahiyeh from IRA(^ on the 26th of May. He at once began to ask all and sundry of those camped there, why they were leading such a quiet and peaceful life in Kuwait, when the IRAQ G-ovemment had gone, and the whole of the southern desert was open to them to raid, kill and loot^ in as they pleased”. The prospective disturber of the peace, I am glad to say, now lies in Kuwait kicking his heels in confinement ( by the Shaikh’s orders. (o) On the 25th May, the news reached Kuwait that several armed bands of Dhafir and Shammar raiders r or one might more appropriately call them camel thieved, had crossed the frontier from IRAQ and were roaming about the country between 3afwan in the north and Subahiyeh in the south. The raiders working in parties of 7 to 10 men, lay low during the day, and started work about sundown. It was very difficult therefore to catch them for they made off with their booty after dark and got across the frontier before dawn. (d) Between 24th May and 2 5th June (the time of writing this report) some 60 camels in all have been taken and made away with. Those who have lost camels have been mostly Kuwait Mutair (Diyahin) camped near Tawil wells, and Kuwait Araibdar and Fiddawiyeh near Uanagish . (S.W. of State). (e) (Greatly angered and irritated by the continuous and almost nightly depredations, the Kuwait tribes have grown restive and are anxious to take the law into their own hand and counter raid. They have however been sternly prevented by the Shaikh- 4 - *tiiQ Shaikh. of iviiwait from doing iliis, and several of the leading Shammr Dhafir and Harh Shaikhs, now camped in Kuwait, have been placed in confinement, (f) On 27th May, a party of 7 raiders growing bolder, started interfering with travellers on the Basra Kuwait Motor road. They posted themselves at a place 15 miles north of Jahara, and fired on the Mail car of the Kuwait Transport Company as she was on her way down from Zubair. The occupants of the car (personally interviewed) returned the fire and got away. (g) On 29th May the Shaikh sent out an armed party in two cars, under one Mirshid al Shammari, to deal with this parti cular party which was operating on the road,and met than in the Abatah area. The raiders thinking the cars ordinary passenger cars tried to stop them and one of them opened fire. Mirshid’s men were quick to take advantage of the situation, jumped out of the cars and attacked the seven camel raiders in spirited fashion. Their first volley dropped one dead,thei^ second dropped two more (not known if wounded or dead) ^here upon the remaining four turned tail. The cars however quickly overtook them and after a short running fight forced them to surrender. Two of the car party men then detailed to bring in the 7 captured camels and the cars proceeded to Kuwait. Unfortunately towards evening of the same day, a supporting party of the raiders,said to number 8 men, followed up the captured camels, and recovered all of them, after shooting one of the Shaikh’s men and forcing the other to beat a rapid ssjots retreat under cover of darkness. (h) The four prisoners turned out to be IRAQ Shammar (sinjara section) and they admitted to the Shaikh and their leader (in a separate interview) to me, that they came from Safwan (IRAQ), where the rest of their tribe was camped. They addedadded that their object was loot only, and that many other young braves of the tribe were out also trying their luck. They said that they understood there was no longer a government to control them, and Kuwait was full of fine and fat camelsJJ When asked why they attacked the mail car, and attempted to hold up the police cars they answered w Akhadna al Shaitan' (The devil persuaded us). (i) On 30th May the Shaikh sent out 10 cars (including 4 armed with Lewis Guns), to try and round up the party who had recovered the camels. They returned empty having failed to come up with the resuers although they searched the whole country lying to the north west of Kuwait State. They found and brought back the missing man (left as escort with the camels and shot). He was wounded in the stomach. 3** Note .- On 1st June 2 men of the rescuing party were caught by Ibn Tawala^ iu?abs and brought in. (j) The above incident following on so many serious camel B&amp;efts from the Kuwait tribes, decided the Shaikh on strong measures. He ordered the Kuv&gt;/ait Kiddawiyeh and Araibdar to concentrate on Jahara, and has instituted daily armed car patrols along the Basra Kuwait road. The cars being based in Jahara. (k) All Bedouin concentrations have been warned to be ready for eventualities, and have been instructed to send out their camels to graze under strong armed guards, where before only herdsmen looked after than. Nor are camels allowed to go far a^field after sundown. (l) His Excellency the Shaikh suggested officially on 3rd June that the IRAQ, Government be asked to instruct their xolice at Safwan to keep more careful watch on the large IRAQ Bedouin encampments at or in the vicinity of Safwan, as from the con fessions of the four Shammar prisoners, everything pointed to the factthe fact that Safwan was being made the starting point, for raiders and thieving parties. The Shaikh has further suggested that the Safwan Police take hostages from among the Shammar and Dhafir Shaikhs for the good behaviour of their followers, as he himself ha&amp; done. (m) While the Shaikh of Kuwait believes that the measures taken by him will have the desired effect for the time being, he is of opinion that unless the IRAQ Government take stronger measures in the desert on their side of the frontier, things will slowly go from bad to worse. Comment .- No doubt with the crushing of the rebellion at RunaLtba and Suk esh Shiyukh . the IRAQ Government will turn its attention to its desert tribesmen. These certainly want a lesson. (n) For the rest His Sxoellenqy made it abundantly clear to the writer, that he in no way suspected that either Bin Saud or the IRAQ preventive service had anything to do with or h&amp;dj^ conniving at the recent raids. It was purely a case of the desert ,f having gone bad M , it behoved both Kuwait and the IRAQ Government to put their heads together to stop things frcm getting worse at the earliest opportunity. 101. COMING VISIT OF THB SHAIKH OF iU./AIT TO LUm^Cl.. The Shaikh of Kuwait has intimated to iiis Majesty’s Government , that he proposes paying a strictly private visit to England on or about the 25th June next. He explained that he had been suffering considerably of late from his teeth besides being generally very run down. He was particularly anxious to have his teeth properly attended to by a good specialist in England. The Shaikh asked that the writer, as his Political Agent, be allowed to accompany him, as he had never been to England since he was a young man and did not know the ropes. Unfortunately- 7 - V i 1 Unfortmately it was found impossible to accede to his request. 102 . OIL .

(a) Messengers from Riath confirm that Bin Saud has once more returned to the Capital, and the usual congratulatory letters and telegrams have been exchanged between the King and the Shaikh of Kuwait. (b) The Saudi Delegates for the Blockade Conference which was to have been held in Kuwait in May, have not as yet arrived, and there are growing indications that the King himself is not over anxious that they diould put in an appearance. He appears to be seizing on every excuse he can possibly think of, as a means for postponing the M evil day ,f . At the time of writing he has seized upon the Shaikh’s protest regarding the abu Shijara armed party incident (see para 87 of Intelligence summary No.8) , to hold up the delegates departure indefinitely*£e has cleverly tried to make out that the party in question were innocently trying to reach Kuwait via Jahara » when 12iey were rounded up, and harshly turned out of the State, as 'they were malefactors. 104. TRIBAL MOVEMENTS &amp; LOCATIONo . Nothing fresh to report, beyond the fact that Mishal ibn Tawala, accompanied by his own family only, has proceeded to Hafar al Batin , in accordance with Ibn Jaloui's orders. Doubt less he thinks it wiser to keep on the right side of Bin Saud. Whether he will be able to get away with it, by saying ' I could notnot persuade any of my tribe to obey my orders and follow me” is another matter. Lieut-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait.

They were accompanied by 4 cars. Comment .- A rtawiyeh is well to the west of and outside the area known as the Hassa Oil Concession, whose western boundary is the Dahana Saud Belt . (See para 60(c) of Kuwait Summary No.6). (b) Major Holmes is still in Kuwait at the time of writing but has hinted pretty broadly that he proposes going to Bahrain shortly to see what the Americans are up to where Qatar is concerned. /*- He has more than once given it as his considered opinion ^ lately that the Standard Oil Company has been carrying on a hard underground intrigue in q,atar .preparatory to having'a go at the Shaikh after 10th May, when Hie period of I.P.C. grace expired. (o) A Bedouin lady member .of the household of the Shaikh of jatar arrived in Kuwait on 16th May (having done the journey from Doha with her children by camel in 30 days). She informed the writer that the Shaikh tod Bin Saud were in constant commu nication and that recently the King' a sister .Noora.^had^sent Shaikh Abdulla bin Thani's wife 50 full sets of frocks/am* 50 Abbas, as well as scents and spices etc. from Hejaz and that the return resent consisted of 3 nares, 6 riding camels and 2 large saddle bags filled with local ladies clothing. The same lady mentioned that she had met two Suropean ladies in Qatar whom the Shaikh’s wife had called on, after dark. Comment.(5) C omment .- Doubtless the Political -agent Bahrain has got the above Qatar news in correct form. It is only maitioned here as savouring of a possible 'oil' intrigue. (d) In connection with para 60(c) of Kuwait Summary No.6, the same source in further news from /Hiath has it that the American Hassa Oil Company are not really out to 'exchange' the southern portion of their concession for another ^square' lying to the North West of their present concession, but, want the new area in addition to their southern portion. They have merely given out that it is an 'exchange' in case the move reaches British ears. 85. .-1IBRICAN IvIIBSlONikHIBS IN Hull . News has been received in Kuwait that Dr. Dame and Party from the ^mierican Mission in Bahrain have reached Hail . No doubt this can be confirmed in Bahrain. It is also stated that Bin Saud had decided shortly to send for Dr. Harrison from Muscat and Dr. Thoms from Bahrain . Both are to meet Dr. Dame i n Riath and all three are to proceed to TAIF and once again perform an operation on the Royal lady, who was so seriously iH last year. Apparanetly last year’s operation was failure. 86 . RIATH NSWS . (a) The Amir Saud is reliably reported to have returned to Riath on 10th Muharram. It is said he will bid farewell to his family and return to Jedda preparatory to proceeding to England. Rumour*! has it that the small wound on his shoulder refuses to heal and that a poisoned dagger is suspected - This probably is pure gossip# (b) From tribal sources the story is everywhere gaming ground that Bin Saud, since the attempt on his life, has become a sort of 'changed character', and that he is treating all and sundry, especially the great tribal Shaikhs of the North with much greater consideration and good will than formerly. This new attitude seems to be puzzling some and to be treated( 6 ) be treated with suspicion by others, I see also para 74(c) of SumcBry No. 7 and interview with Moh&amp;med ibn rfajaan of Shammer (Aslam).1. These stories I think tend to show that the King's 'stock' is once again on the upward move. It fell greatly in North Kast of Arabia during and after the Yamen Campaign. R7. CROSSING OF KIT,/AT T FRONTIER BY S^JSI ARI.iND_PARTY . (described in detail for thebenefitofFeddal (a) On 6th May a small armed party (six men) of Saudi troops from Hoffuf under one Half abu Shijara crossed the southern frontier of Kuwait and proceeded to Subahiyeh (10 miles inside the frontier), where theiv leader mntemi in high handed manner ordered Shaikh Mishal al Timiat (Shammar Sinjara) to immediately remove his tribe from Kuwait territory, and proceed to fjaf_gr Batin, 150 miles to the south west, .abu Shijara gave out that he brought the order direct from Ibn Jaloui, governor of Hassa, who in turn had received it frcm the King by telegram. Shaikh Mishal after pointing out that he and his tribe were always at Bin Sand's command if he wanted them for a raid or war measure, refused to comply in the present instance as the heat was very great, and a move across 150 miles of waterless desert to Hafar with women, children and sheep, would entail great hardship and loss* (b) After sundry threats as to what would happen if he persisted in his refusal, Abu Shijara proceeded to the p Dhafir sections(under Ajemi as Suwait and Jadaan al Suwalt) camped near Tawil wells - Here also he gave orders for an immediate evacuation of Kuwait territory, but the Dhafir were given the choice of going to the Neutral Zone, or to Hafar al Batim with Shammar. (c) Abu Shijara next move*on to Jaha=a (20 miles west of Kuwait) and gave similar orders to Ibn Tawala of Shamir Aslam (al Saiyeh). The latter also pleaded inability to move. (d) Similar orders were sent by single messengers to Shai uaar(7) Shammar details camped near Safwan and ft Athaiba and Ruhail (both just over border in IRAQ,). (e) By this tioe the news of Abu Shijara’s activities reached Kuwait, and the Shaikh at once sent out the son of A1 Nafisi with two or three men by car, and ordered Abu Shijara and party to repair to Kuwait. This they did, being lodged in Al Nafisi’s house (the Trade Agent of Bin Saud). (f) Abu Shijara was asked if he had brought any letters from Ibn Jaloui for the Shaikh, and if not why he had acted in such high handed manner, when he was no longer in Saudi terri tory. His reply was that he neither had letters nor had he been told to approach the Shaikh of Kuwait. His orders were to go straight to Shammar and turn them out with the Dhafir. That he had hoped to catch them before they entered Kuwait but had not succeeded, therefore he had followed them/ Subahiyeh and Jahara. (g) Both the Shaikh and Nafisi visited the writer as soon as Abu Shijara was brought in, the former to ask that protest be immediately be made to Bin Saud at Bin J'aloui*s action, and the latter to say that by the Shaikh of Kuwait’s orders he was sending the party straight back to Hassa - a 1 Nafisi quite candidly blamed ibn Jaloui and said that he should at least have send, letters to the Shaikh of Kuwait, more especially as Shammar and Dhafir were in the position of guests of Kuwait, and had already formally applied to be allowed to summer in Kuwait (ani all but Ajemi as Suwait) had been granted permission. He added that He had telegraphed to ibn Jaloui to this effect. (h) As a result of the incident ibn Tawala himself messengers pos'd nasow uu (i) In the meantime repaired to Hoffuf, and Ajemi and Hishal al Timiat sent messengers post haste to Riath to protest to Hair Saud. (i) In the meantime the IJutair (Braih) sections camped at Hnfar al Batin , hearing to Ha far, and knowing that sent( 8 ) sent messengers to Ibn Jaloui and Bin Baud to plead against the order. (j) General exciteniffint therefore reigns in the local Bedouin world as a result of Ibn Jaloui’s stupid order. Comment .- (i) That so much alarm and bother could hafre been created and over such a wide area, by^ the arrival of 6 men of Bin Baud’s forces and their delivery of a mere verbal order, shows how high the prestige of Bin Baud stands, and how greatly his long arm is feared. Would that the IRAQ, Government’s control of her tribes was of similar kind - we should certainly hear less about ’’Kuwait smuggling”, if it were. (ii) For the information of those at a distance, the strength of Bhammar is approximately as follows At Bubahiyeh 600 tents 400 tents ^estimated 200 tents ) by hearsay iit Jahara At Athaiba At Bafwan etc . 400 tents ) only. (ill) strength of Dhafir at Tawil 200 tents. (iv) It is interesting to reca.ll that Mohamed al Wajaan of Aslam Shammar told me on 29th April that Bin Baud had clearly told Bhammar that if their own country had an insufficiency of grazing, they could go down to Kuwait with their families and camp there for the summer (see para 74(a) of Summary No.7). 88. IRAQ. RF3FLLI0M. (a) In spite of the most careful censorship in IRAQ,, 1#e wild end most exagerated rumours have got about among the Desert tribes, and in the tov/n of Kuwait, regarding the progress of events round Rumaltha and Hasriyeh on the Suphrates British aeroplanes are said to he bombing the tiibes, and British Armoured cars to have been seen operating south of Shinafiyeh. The troubleThe trouble has been increased rather than lessened by the holding up of nev/spapers from IRAQ,. (b) Most strongest orders have been passed by the Shaikh of Kuwait, against the sale of any sort of arms to IRAQ tribes men, and Kuwait tribes have been notified that the sale of rifle to any IRAQI will render the seller liable to a flogging, imprisonment and fine. Notices to this effect have been posted everywhere in Kuwait town and the IRaQ vernacular papers have been asked to xsjiKiDtuMa reproduce the Shaikh’s proclamation. (c) In conversation with me the Shaikh has more than once pointed out that he is fully alive to the danger of arms being bought in Kuwait and sent to IRAQ, and has taken full precaution accordingly. The danger he says is the number of foreign tribes now in Kuwait. These are not entirely under his control. (d) In the above connection Mohamed ibn Wajaan of Shammar camped at Athaiba (in IRAQ) told me on 29th April that 15 camels laden with rifles had secretly gone up to the Euphrates from Shmaar Abda, who are all camped about Arkhainiyeh and Dulaimiyeh (IRAQ Neutral Zone), and that ammunition in some quantity had gone from Buraida and Hail during Abdul Wahid’s rebellion. 89. SMUGGLING TO IRAQ . (a) The troubles on the Euphrates appear to have caused a marked falling off in the number of IRAQI tribesmen , who of recent months visited Kuwait, and scareely ^ single Iniv.JI can be found these days in the town. They presumably are too busy at home. (b) On 16th May news was received in Kuwait that a small smuggling party,9onsisting of men of the Araif section of the Dhafir tribe,had been intercepted at Chalawa, 20 miles within the IRAQ border by Customs patrol cars and that these camels had been taken. Though details are lacking, it is said that 6 IRAQIS were killed and 3 tribesmen including the Shaikh’s son. (o) From the Shaikh of Kuwait's and my point of view the news was( 10 ) news was excellent, and IRA^ are to be congratulated on at l^ast sending car patrols to watch their side of the frontier. 'May we hear/ ef a lot more of such methods' was the pious hope expressed by the Shaikh to me, referring to the affir. 90. LOCATION OF lOJ-AIT &amp; ffORHiaN TRIBES * On 16th May, the following tribes were located as follows:- (a) Kuwait tribes (Araibdar and Fiddawiyeh) at Tawil wells (north west of Subahiyeh ) (b) Shammar (Abda) in IRAQ, Neutral Zone. (c) Shammar (Timiat) at Subahiye h (Kuwait). (d) Shammar (Aslam) at Jahara, ^thaiba and Safwan. (©) Harb (Details only with al Timiat) at Subahiyeh . (f) Dahamsha (IRAQ iinaze) (i) Jazaa ibn Mijlad at Iiafar and in Bashuk area (Saudi Arabia) (ii) Koh&amp;med ibn Mao lad a ' t Rumalla (in company with Dhafir al Badrah) (iii) A large party at Urn Nlga (Kuwait). (g) Dhaflr Details at:- (a) At Tawil (Kuwait). (b) Um Klga (Kuwait). (c) Al Rumalla (IKA 1 ;;) (d) Al Sufwan (IRAQ). Note. - From the above it will be seen that the IRAQ Dahamsha and Saudi Shammar tribes, who normally reside far from Kuwait borders are either in Kuwait territoiy or in areas immediately bordering on Kuwait. The reason, as I have had occasion to say in previous summaries is because N.E. Arabia and especially Kuwait and the Neutral lone, was blessed with superb rains during the winter of 1934/S5. The Nomad tribes must and always will follow the grazing, and by ancient Arab law and custom, no State or Government should ever attempt to prevent such persons entering their pasture lands when they do so maaamxxiyx of necessity.

The upstairs portion of the New Agency has now been wired, the downstairs (office portion) was started on 30th April* Owing to a bad heat wave, which passed over Kuwait, work is somewhat behind programme. No electric fans have yet arrived from England, but as the Kuwait Electric Company only promised these two months from the date the order was given, they cannot be blamed. In the meantime the heat at the time of writing is very trying, and there seems little likelihood of things improv ing until the fans arrive and are erected. (b) Agency Furniture from India . This arrived suddenly in the last week of April, but very unfortunately the best pieces of furniture and those most urgently require^namely, 2 Ladies Dressing Tables with long cheval glasses, 1 Man’s Dressing Table with glass and 3 Ladies Wardrobe with full length glasses, cannot be totalling 5 with 2 side wing mirrors taken into use, as all the full length mlrrori*/(belonging to 1 Ladies Dressing Table) arrived broken into many frag ments. This I regret to say was due to extremely bad and careless packing. A separate report is being furnished on the subject with 'Lloyds official Survey'. For the rest the furniture was plain, and well made but not^up to English standard. (o) The Union Jack was flown on the New Flagstaff in the New Agency on the 30th April. 69 # SAUDIYEH BLOCKADE C0ML1ISSI0N. Latest news from Jeddah points to the arrival of the Conmission about the middle of May. (Later - As one writes this, news has just come in 9.5.35, that the delegates expect to arrive on 24th May.) 70. This distinguished Arab arrived at Kuwait on 21st April and left again3 212 v left again on 25th. Calls were exchanged, and Syed Hamid gave the writer some more interesting views on what he called the 'extraordinary bad tactics adopted by his Government', where the Shaikh of Kuwait’s Date gardens were concerned and in the matter of IR&amp;Q’s smuggling accusations. A full summary of what Syed Hamid Beg said has been submitted in a separate report, but it is interesting to record that in ; the matter of smuggling, the distinguished visitor, speaking as an IRAQI, gave it his opinion that the only fair and just course for his government to adopt was to place a string of customs plus Police posts along the Kuwait Iraq frontier (a maximum of 4, he opined would be sufficient) with car patrol watching the intervening gaps - He was definitely against asking the Shaikh to oo-operate, as this would only lead to a wider breach in relations. The burden of taking preventive action j&amp;ould fall on the far more powerful and strong country IRAQ - These measures coupled with a genious effort on the part of IRAQ to cultivate more friendly relations with Kuwait would, said the Syed, effect more than all diplomatic talk. To bring about a satisfactory solution of the problem, for if treated well, the Shaikh would naturally co-operate. 71. OIL. Mr 0 Rhodes is once more about again and he and Mr. Growl, his companion, are still examining surface conditions north of the Bay of Kuwait. The heat is, however, handicapping their work greatly. 72 # VISIT OF IRQMININT TRIBAL SHAIKHS . During the period under review the following visited the writer:- /•n M/Vhamari hin uthain Misra sect (Ajman) I8i-t 4 (Q) Saddah bin Majlaad, Dabamsba (Anaze).

The following were the locations of various prominent Shaikhs and tribes on 30th April:- (1) Kuwait Tribes (Fiddawiyeh and Araibdar) camped for the summer at the wells of Tawil north west of Subaihiyeh. (2) Dhafir (Ajemi as Suwait) at Subaihiyeh . awaiting final permission of Shaikh of Kuwait to camp for summer. (3) Awazim (Bin Jama) at Wafra . where they have camped for summer. (4) Shammar (a) A slam section under Mashal bin Tawala at Jahara, camped for sumner. m Aslam section under Mohamed bin Wajaan at Athaiba, moving to Jahara . (b) Sin.jara section under Mishal at Timmiat, camped at Subaihiyeh for summer. (o) Abda section under Ibn Ali, ibn Shurraim, ibn Jabrin, camped in Tawal al Dhafir (5) Anaze Dahmnsha section under Jaad bin Majlaad camped for Sumner at Safwan. Mohamed al Majaan of Shammar Aslam in an interesting talk on 29th April said:- (a) That Bin Saud had allowed all his Shammar tribes to go up to all Euphrates towns as often as they liked to buy supplies (musabila), but had excluded x^uwait. He had however told them that in the event of their own country (round about LINA) not having enough grazing for flocksflocks and camels (like the present year) they could come to Kuwait with all their families, settle down Ifaere for summer and draw supplies from Kuwait.' That is why they were in Kuwait new. (b) He added that -£■ Shammar lived in IRA^ and owed allegiance, but that the southern half including Abda, Aslam, Sinjara were all good subjects of Bin Saud. Bin Saud treated them will, because he feared they would go over to IRAQ, ist if he offended them. (c) Bin Saud these days was being extra nice to Shammar and his own Nejd tribes — This boded something 'not good' opined the Shaikh. (d) Bin Saud was slowly but surely winning over all Shammar to his standard with the exception of the purely IRAQ Sharrmar tribes in the north of Ajil al Yawar ^nd Aqab ibn Ajil. (e) It was only a question of time for Bin Saud to get hold of the Dhafir and Dahamsha, as he regretted having to say so, but IRAQ*s policy was apparently anti-Bedouin, and was driving all good men away from her. 75.

Shaikh Abdulla al Ahmad al Subah. Shaikh Hillal bin Fajhan al Mutaifci. Shaikha Mariam bint Mubarak al Subah. Note . The last named person is the youngest daughter of the great Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait and wife of the late Shaikh Saud al Mohamed al Subah, who during his life time used to reside at Kut al Zain in IRAQ. (2) The Political Agent als4&gt; visited Shaikh Hamad al Mubaral al Subah on 28th March at w.asr Mishrif , and dined with him in company with the European community in Kuwait (an annual affair). (3) On 29th March the Political Agent visited Burgan hills in company with Major F. Holmes, the Shaikh of Kuwait’s repre sentative in the Kuwait Oil Company - The object of the visit was to examine the oil deposits there. Note . Whilst examining the 'crater' of the Burgan hills a verj interesting discovery was made by Mrs. Dickson, who accompanied the party. She lighted up on the remains of what was clearly a 'prehistoric' village and which had beai uncovered by water action as the result of Kuwait’s recent heavy rains. A careful search was made and some 200 flint knives and scrapers were collected - These are believed to be of the 'Neolithic- period and are being sent to the British Museum by the writer mi | 1 RECs. pr. 5 £?t7 '18 APR 1935 IND.a office2 for identification. The above is the first positive find of prehistoric relics to be made in Kuwait principality.

On the 31st March a letter^ was received from Bin Baud by the Shaikh of Kuwait (under date 20th March) in which a full description of the recent attempt on his life in the great Mosque at Mecca, was given. According to the King, a small bomb or very light pistol was exploded close to the well of Zemzem at the moment when he turn was doing the 'Tawaf' or last/round the Kaaba - This was intended by the plotters to attract attention in the direction of Zemzem - Immediately afterwards 3 Yemenis rushed at the King with daggers from the opposite direction to that of the well Ze^sem, and 'tried to assasinate him - They were all of them shot down however - The last of than dying an hour after being hit. The King completed the f, Tawaf n ceremony and returned to his Palace. Though the King did not say so in his letter, the reports from Mecca said that the iimir Saud who was with his father received a slight dagger scratch in the shoulder in helping to grapple with one of the Assailants l see para 37 of Sumnary No. 4 of 1935). jPlease see addendaj 41.

The following3 The following were the locations of various Shaikhs and tribes on 31st March. (1) Kuwait Tribes (Fidawiyeh and Araibdar) under Amir Half bin Hajraf echeloned from Khor al Ha.ila (west end of Kabd ridge) to Taw 11 wells 5 miles N.W. of V/ara peak. Their next move will probably be to the Tawil and Subahiyeh regions (south Kuwait). (2) Awazlm (Saudi Tribe) under the Amir Ibn Jam and other Shaikhs have once again entered Kuwait territory from their country in north Hassa . At the moment of writing they have spread themselves over a large area from Subahiyeh in the east to Man&amp;gish and the Shaqq on the west. Their presence is as usual welcomed as it means increased business for Kuwait. The tribe is in great strength and consists of a rough computation of some 600 tents. Commen^. The Awazim appear to be bent on replenishing supplies /' from Kuwait, and as far as can be judged have entered Kuwait in spite of Bin Saud’s Blockade officials. (3) Shflnurar (^mmiat section under Shaikh Mishal) have entered Kuwait from the direction of Rigal and are camped on the southern border of Kuwait on the west side of the Shaqq . Their object is to replenish supplies and take advantage of the splendid grazing that exists. Shaikh Mishal &amp;as applied for penaission to camp at Tawil and Subahiyeh in the south of the State for Ihe next two months and as Shamnar are friendly disposed towards Kuwait have been told they may do so. Comment . This is a normal migration and needs no comment. (4) Dhaflr (under Ajemi al Suwait, Jadaan as Suwait and Hantush as Suwait) entered Kuwait State from the west about 15th March and are camped west of Jahara, from Kraa al llaru in the north west to Urn Russ in the south. Ajemi has alreadyalready applied for permission to camp for the snmmer on tiie Imfil Tells in ^ie scntiiern area of tile State, bat as the tribe bears a bad reputation and as the sh«| Vh of Kuwait cannot forget their mny hostile acts of 3 years ago when they sat just outside the southern frontier and under pretence of serving Sin Send constituted themselves a sort of blockade force of their own, the Shaikh has refused his permission - The Shafir will be allowed to graze in Kuwait State till the hot weather sets in, then they must go. (5) Muntafi^ Shethard Tribes . These as already reported have s^ad themselves rather liie locusts over a wide area L south and west of Kuwait. Except for the 'Budur' they are well behaved.

REBELLION OB THE TRIBES ON SUPHRATBS . Reference paragraph 38 of Kuwait Intelligence Summary No.4 for period 16th February to 15th March 1935. One is glad to record that latest news from IRA^ shows that the rebellion on the Euphrates died of its own accord, _ after the IRAQ, Cabinet of Ali Joudet Beg had resigned, and the in-coming Cabinet had acceded to most of the demands of the rebel leaders. ns this peaceful ending to what might have been an ugly outbreak could not have been foreseen by the writer, it may be of interest to know that he approached the Shaikh of Kuwait on 16th March, with the suggestion that it would be a til wisewise move and one that would be appreciated by bis Sister State if a very strict embargo was put on rifles of any descrip tion leaving Kuwait for the hinterland Bedouins: The Shaikh with great readiness agreed, and after the 16th March no Bedouin was allowed to take out even his own rifle that he had brought into the city to have repaired by the local gunsmith. At the time of writing the embargo is still in force, but will probably be taken off again soon. Note .- For the uninitiated it may be mentioned that Kuwait is barred by treaty with His Majesty’s G-ovemment to import rifles from overseas or engage in ’’Arms Traffic”. She has half a dozen gunsmiths, however, who keep s$ops for the ”repair” of rifles of Bedouins coming in from the interior. They are also permitted to sell shot guns and shot gun cartridges, under local licehse, also a certain number of rifles that have been left in ’’pawn” by Bedouins who are unable to redeem them. It may also be mentioned that every Bedouin arriving in Kuwait from the interior must deposit his rifle at the main gate. He gets it back when he leaves the town. 49. SIUIKH OF KUWAIT’S DATS GARDENS . (a) It is reported that a mysterious and very disturbing theft of official documents has taken place from the Court archives in Basra. (b) It appears that recently and on a certain date ( so far unknown) the now famous ”Power of Attorney” given by the lady Aysha of Constantinople to her husband mhmad Pasha al Zuhair in 1907 in which she authorised him to sell her portion of the Faddaghiyeh estate to Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait,, was deliberately ”cut out” of the Court records and made away with. (c) It will be recollected that the plaintiff in the Faddaghiyeh case, Abdulla al Zuhair (assisted in the background by the two surviving daughters of the lady Aysha and their counsel K.B. Mirza Mohamed of Basra) intended contesting the presentpresent Shaikh’s right to possess the property, on the grounds that the ’’Power of Attorney”,given to Ahmad Pasha al Zuhair, was a forgery and could not be produced today, (d) At great trouble and expense a true copy of the said document was obtained from the Istambul ’’Somerset House” by the Shaikh of Kuwait, just before the disastrous fire there, which destroyed most of the Turkish land records for all time. (e) How this theft is going to affect H.M. Government ’ s position vis a vis the Faddaghiyeh remains to be seen. It is reported that Judge Lloyd of Basra made the startling discovery himself, and is about to proceed to Baghdad to maks report to the Minister of Justice on the matter. Comment .- Clearly three groups of persons would be interested in making away with the documents•- (a) Abdulla al Zuhair, claimant in one third of the Faddaghiyeh. (b) The two ladies and their lawyer (Mirza Mohamed) mentioned above. (c) Certain interested persons in the IRAQ Government itself. and. one hopes that vigorous measures will be taken to invest!- gate the circumstances of the theft.

Distribution asyl usual.'ADDENDA” to paragraph 40 His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait in order to show his and the people of Kuwait’s gratitude to Almighty God for the recent escape of His Majesty the King from the knife of the assasin, decided to declare the 8th April a public holiday and hold Bedouin horse races, various forms of gun and equine display and war dancing of Desert and Town Arab 'braves” etc. etc. These were held outside the western gate of the Town at 3 P.M. on the 8th April and were got up with great enthusiasm and run in exceptionally lavish style - The whole town, male and female turned out for the festivities, and special invitations were issued to the Political Agent and the European Gommunity. A feature of the evening was the repeated war cry (Hausa) that went up and was heard on all sides 'We thank God for the King’s safety' - It was really a remarkable tribute from the people of Kuwait and shows that whatever the political differences that exist between the State of Kuwait and Saudiyeh, at heart Kuwaitis look upon Bin Saud as their KNIGHT 'without fear and without reproach' and the Champion of Islam.SECRET.

(a) On the 8 th April His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait invited the leading merchants of the town to his office and •suggested2 suggested that they form a limited company for the purpose of taking up the work of landing cargo from the steamers, which work has sojdfar been carried out by the local Customs. The merchants readily agreed to the proposal and intimated that they were prepared to raise a sum of fis 200,000 for the purpose. It is believed that Messrs The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited have also approached His Excellency the Shaikh with a view to trying to obtain the monopoly for landing cargo for themselves. Nothing seems to have so far been finally decided and the matter is under His Excellency's consideration. (b) His Excellency the Shaikh still remains camped at his country seat Biyan , with all his family. As this is 8 miles from Kuwait, one finds it rather difficult to keep close touch. His Excellency will probably remain at Bijran until 1st June. Owing to continued poor health, he does not come into tfte town much, but has work taken out to him. (c) It is an old custom and one peculiar to Kuwait, for every person of any standing, to go into camp in the country during the spring months (rabiah) of » each year. It is the one opportunity that their women folk and children have of getting a change of air. This camp life usually lasts from about 1st March to 1st June, and gives great opportunity to great and small to entertain friends and relatives. The wonderful rains of 1954-35 have mde things particularly , pleasant this year for these camping parties.

SAUDIYEH BLOCKADE COMMISSION . There is still no news, as to the date when the above Commission will reach Kuwait. Rumours from Bahrain have it that the 3 members of the Co mmi ssion which sat there, have returned to Hoffuf in Hassa. In the meantime the Shaikh awaits theit arrival, having intimated that he proposes putting them up in his own palace when they do come, and entertaining them for as long as they care to enjoy his hospitality. 57 # VISIT OF MR. QGILVIK-FORBES &amp; MR. STAFFORD OF TRK BRITISH BAGHDAD. (a) Both arrived by R.A.F. Flying Boat on 4th April and owing to rough weather had great difficulty in getting ashore. They finally landed at Shuwaikh 4 miles west of the town, where they were met by me* Mr. Stafford returned by Flying Boat on 5th April and Mr* Ogilvie-Forbes on 7th April. (b) Interesting and informal talks were held in the Agency on matters connected with the Shaikh's Date Gardens in IRAQ, and I was able to put IRAQ’S Smuggling accustaions against Kuwait. forward much of Kuwait's point of view which I think had not ^ been realized by His Majesty’s Embassy. A report of these private talks was submitted to Bushlre under separate letter. (c) Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes confirmed the theft of the Bower of Attorney reported in paragraph 4G of Kuwait Summary No. 5 of Attorney ..4 ftl 1 er ( an old friend ) Tfl-rriya he lost his way for a the 'track' again by the assi assistance of a 'Sbei' tribesman,who whole day, but eventually found he nicked uphe picked up# (b) Mr. Philby arrived with high fever on him, so was at once put to bed. He was declared fit to travel on 17th April and left on 18th April for Basra, Baghdad and Damascus. (c) During Mr. Philby’s convalescence, I was able to get seme interesting information from him regarding Nejd oil, and Bin Baud’s past and future policy in regard to Kuwait. The gist of these were reported to Bushire under separate letter. (d) There is little doubt, I think that Mr. Philby would have liked to have discussed Oil questions and the Neutral Zone with Jfr. Longrigg of the I.P.C. who arrived somewhat mysteriously from IRA^ simultaneously with Mr. Philby. He was perhaps, for tunately prevented from doing so by his sickness. 59. THS H A J . Reference paragraph 51 of Kuwait Summary No. 5. All the cars which left Kuwait for the HaJ on 31st January, returned safely on the 7th April. The 14 Indian pilgrims (Patbans) mentioned in paragraph 35 (4) of Kuwait Summary No. 4 arrived back on 12th April and left for Basra on 13th April. Contrary to which was earlier reported, the party just failed to make Mecca in time for the Haj ceremony, 60. OIL* (a) The Kuwait Oil Company’s geologist Mr. Crowle is still in Camp, making a 'close' survey of the 'Mudira' region (North side of the Bay of Kuwait) His brother geologist Ur. Rhodes unfortunately went down with dysentry early in April, at the time of writing he is convalescent. (b) Major Holmes is still in nuwait. (c) News which is said to have been received from an “ al, ,r °” tl. effect that the Steady! Oil CoMeay of California 1. activ ely: 5 : actively trying to exchange the southern half of their Hassa concession (From Ojair to Jabrin ), for a new area of equal size lying to the north west of their present concession. The new area to include the towns of Hail . Buraida . Anaiza . Zilfi . MaJinaa in the province of Oasim . The abo*e news, which I consider highly important, forms the subject of another report. 61. PROMmSNT TRIBAL VISITORS . (a) Reference paragraph 47(d) of Kuwait Summary No. 5. Shaikh Ali al Shuwairbat died on 14th April. The tribal verdict is that his wife had cast an evil spell (Seher) over him by the aid of a certain Sallubba lady, as she was afraid of losing his affection,though medical evidence clearly shows that death was due to consumption - Let us hope the unfortunate lady will come to no harm. (b) Khalaf bin Dham and Gatab bin Ja’ad, both important Shaikhs of Shammar (Tinmiat section) 9 alled on me on 15th April and gave useful news regarding the lack of grazing in their own country. They prophesied a general move of IRA^ Bedouin tribes into north east He .id and Hassa . 62. DESBRT NBV/S AND TRIBAL MQViMSNTS . The following were the locations of the various prominent Shaikhs and tribes on the 15th April 1935.- (i) Kuwait tribes (Flddawiyeh and Araibdar) tinder Amir Half bin Hajruf. These are camped in Kabd area 30 miles south west of Kuwait, and are keeping a careful eye on movements of Ajemi as Suwait and his Dhafir lying to the west and north of than. They drink from Tawil wells and Khabrat Botly.eh - distant 15 miles from their camp, liil Dhafir . (a) Suwait section under Shaikh Ajemi and Jadaan are camped west of Subaihlyeh and Tawil wells, south west of Kuwait6 Kuwait State, and are in some strength (100 tents). (b) The A1 Said section of the Dhafir are in the vicinity of Kra al Maru . a point north west of Jahara. Both the above drink from Jahara . Comment . The Dhafir Shaikhs are still pressing the Shaikh of Kuwait to be allowed to camp for the summer in his territory, but the latter has so far refused permission (see comments to paragraph 42(4) of Kuwait Summary No. 5^) (iii) Shammar . ( a ) TiTn™iat section under Shaikh Mishaal ibn Bandar, are camped in the vicinity of Subaihiyeh wells ifoore the Shaikh has given them permission to stay during summer on condition the tribe agrees to pay 'Zikat' beforehand. (b) Abda section (main group) under Shaikh ibn Shurraim and ibn Jabrin are camped in the Tawal , al Dhafir (Iraq Neutral Zone) round about Dulaimlyeh,Julaida and Arkhaimiyeh . They draw supplies from Kuwait and drink from the above named wells. (o) Anlam section partly at Safwan (IRAQ) and partly west of JahJa (Kuwait). Mlshal ibn Tawala their Shaikh is near Jahara . (iv) Anaze . (a) Dahemsha sections .u nder ibn Mijlaad are reported to have arrived in the area S.W. of m Batin and to have requested Bln Baud to permit them to camp for the summer in that area. (b) Daha msha sections under Mohamed bin Turkiare camped near Busa lja in the southern Iraq desert. (C ) . oontlnF ^t of Dahamsha under Jaad bin Mijlad have camped at Safwan, Kuwait border. (d) ^ of Anaze_ (Amarat) have already appeared in Kuwait. Their camels are in poor condition. They are7 23c. They are camped in the Kuwait ^thdibba * 1 west of Jahara. (y) Awazim under the Amir Ibn Jama are still in Kuwait territory. Sheen sections , are echeloned between Subalhiyeh and the southern border of the Kuwait Neutral Zone. C^mel sections « are concentrated in the triangle formed by Subaihiyeh . Kabd and Managish . The tribe is in great strength and will probably sumner in the Kuwait Neutral Zone not Subaihiyeh . as reported in Summary No• 5. Notes , (i) The move of (iii) and (iv) Shammar and Anaze towards the region of the Persian Gulf from their own distant country in the IRAQ, western, and south western deserts is abnormal . Prom .careful enquiries it would appear that there is considerable scarcity of grazing everywhere in the IRAQ desert area,west of post, and so tendency is for these tribes to move in a south easterly direction towards the Hassa and Kuwait, where grazing is everywhere plentiful. The plan being to leave un touched what grazing their own lands possess as a ^ reserve for their return in the autumn. (ii) The migration of the Awazim (e) is normal, as they annually come into the Neutral Zone and Kuwait to arrange marriages with their ^Kuwait brethren and take back supplies to their own country. Though Bin Baud does not like it, the move is a necessity, never suffices for the large number of sheep and camels which essity, seeing that their own country's grazing a for the large number of sheep and camels which this tribe possesses. (iii) Dhafir . This tribe has of recent years regularly visited Kuwait and Nejd areas owing to their dissatisfaction with the way the IRAQ Government treats them. They axe very out of hand as far as IRAQ, is concerned, and their Shaikhs, with the way tne ik&amp;q uo out of band as far as IR nearly all, are now rece Their anxiety to stay in (iii) Dhafir . nearly all, are now receiving secret subsidies from Bin Saud. Their anxiety to stay in Kuwait this year is due to the grazing Itvseemsf 8 It seems a great pity, however, that the IRAQ Government does not appear to have any settled 'policy' in dealing with her Nomaa tribes and one sees them drifting slowly further and further away from their own country. Bin Saud is of course quite content to 'lie back' and see these IRAQ Nomad tribes come over to his side. * * Lieut-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait. Political Agency, Kuwait.

(1) The Political Agent visited the Neutral Zone from 23rd to 25th February, his object being to get in touch with certain Bani Khalid Shaikhs from Qatif who had come up with their families on an annual visit. The Shaikhs visited were: (a) Abdul Muhsin ibn Mahanna al Khazar, (b) Jarbua ibn Abdulla al Khazar. ( 2 ) In course of conversation with the above it was learned that his section was in trouble with Bin Saud, and were anxious to acquire some 20 rifles to hand in to the king in place of those that had been served out to them for the Yemen Campaign, and which they, with many other Bedoins immediately after the war, had sold to buy food. Most of the rifles so sold had, it was said, gone to Jebel Shamrar country. The king had too late heard of such sales, and had sent hurried orders to all the tribes to hand their weapons in at once - failing which they would have to produce something similar from their own stocks. COMMENT. Similar stories to the above have come in from the Mutair and Awazim country and there may be a connection between the above sales and the news received in Kuwait on 15th March that 20 camel loads of rifles had been smuggled up to the Middle Euphrates from Jebel Shammar . about the end of February. 32 # VISIT OF CONTRE ADMIRAL RIVET IN FRENCH CRUISER BOUGAINVILLE. (a) On 22nd February 1935 the French Warship Bougainville visited Kuwait with Rear Admiral Rivet of the French Eastern Mediterranean Squadron on board. (b)(b) The usual official calls, return calls, lunches and banquets took place, as befitted the visit of a high naval officer of a foreign power• (c) After the Shaikh had paid his official call on board the warship in company with the Political Agent, he yf was shown round the ship by the Admiral in person* The Shaikh later remarked to the writer that while he was impressed by the smat new appearance of the ship, and especially by the twin 'DIESSSL' engines with which she was equipped, he did not think the general turn out of the crew and their appearance could compare with that of British Sailors* (d) Both Admiral Rivet and the five Staff officers who accompanied him appeared to know everything that was to be known about the Persian Gulf and the interior of Arabia, and most of them had read the standard English works on Bin Saud (including the works of modem authors like A.T. Wilson, Philby, Thomas, Captain Armstrong etc.)* Indeed the Admiral went so far as to say that our English books with their excellent maps, were far superior to anything published (especially the maps) on the Continent of Europe* (e) The following points of interest were mentioned ' v by Rear Admiral Rivet in the course of a long informal talk, which he had with the writer in the Agency (i) He was amused at the attitude of the Arabs at Has el Khaim . who not only asked if he would sell them arms, but appeared to think that Prance and England were on bad terms (a good example of the ignorance existing on the Trucial Coast). (ii) He had desired to visit Shargah but his superiors had refused permission. (iii) He discussed at length the anchorage of Ras Tanura, and made several shrewed observations as to its future possibilities. , . l iv)'AS \ v Vv * v y &amp; 3 (iv) He said he knew Fuad Hamza (a Syrian Druse and French subject he called him) and the latter had promised to arrange a meeting between the king and himself on his return visit to Jedda. (v) He appeared to know all about Bin Saud’s / blockade of Kuwait, and of IRAQ£ obvious desire (his words) to gain possession of the principality. He laughingly compared Kuwait to the beautiful young lady whom both IRAQ and Bin Saud were anxious to marry. (vi) He knew a Mrs. Marks (now Mrs. Fletcher) and asked my opinion of her. (vii) He enquired about Hoffuf . and the various routes into the interior. (viii) He opined that Bin Saud had done well to make the peace he had done with Yemen , as if the Campaign had gone he would have been beaten. (ix) He said that in the view of his government as soon as Bin Saud died his Bmpire would collapse and there would once again be chaos in Arabia, until such time as another strong man arose and got a grip of things (if ever such a thing could take place again). (x) He hoped that a French warship would visit the Gulf every two years from now on, though he seemed to take some pains to explain that France had no real interests in the Persian Gulf. (xi) He discussed the 'Cairo Broadcasting Station' and 'Arab Newspapers' generally and gave it as his opinion that Jfinglanfi. and France should keep a vqTj careful watch on what was dessimated, as news ape -l especially were capable of doing an enorm us amount of harm seeing that Arabian readers regularly believed that anything they said in print must be true. The Bougainville left Kuwait at 4 A.M. on the 23rd February. 33.-: 4 33. TRIBAL MQVSMBNTa. Nothing of interest to report. 34 . DEATH Off EX KING ALI IN BAGHDAD . (a) The news of the death of the above important personage on 13th February 1935 was received with genuine concern by the Shaikh and the Kuwait public generally: It was everywhere remarked that young King Ghazi of IRACi would now be left entirely alone to face the thousand and one intriguers who surrounded his person in Baghdad. That after the death of Faisal, King Ali had quite naturally taken up the task of guiding the young king in the way that he should go, and that so long he was alive all was well. Ex King Ali was likened locally to the steersman *o- 'Nakhuda' who held the helm for King Ghazi's ship of State. His death, according to general opinion, was a misfortune for IRAQ, second only to that of King Faisal, his late lamented brother. (b) His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait sent condolence telegrams to H.M. King Ghazi, the Amir Abdulla and the IRAQ Prime Minister, and received suitably worded replies. 35. THB HAJ . (1) In addition to the large Kuwait 'Camel' Haj party which left on 31st January to cross Arabia (via para 17 of Summary No. 3) a party carried in 37 motor cars left Kuwait for Mecca via Riath on 5th March. Most of the cars came from Basra and other places in southern IRAQ, though some four cars were owned in Kuwait itself. ( 3 ) Four days before the great Haj day was due, H.M&lt;s Consul Basra telegraphed to say that a party of some 14 Indian Muslims wanted to proceed via Kuwait -r. a minute effort to do the pilgrimage and asked if there was any objection to their going via Kuwait. Apparently party had arranged a gamble with certain taxi drivers in KuwaitKuwait and Basra to the effect that if they were put down in Mecca in time, they (the drivers) would get Rs 450/- from each passenger, but if they were late, half fare only would be paid. (3) The Shaikh on being consulted advised that the unfortunates be allowed to start as it was a serious thing to stop a Haji half way through his journey - the necessary permit was telegraphed to H.M* s Consul accordingly. ( 4 ) It is understood that the party arrived in time. 36. OIL . (a) The Shaikh on 23rd February showed the writer a long letter which he had received from Mr. Jansen lat«-of the Eastern and General Syndicate - The letter was dated 13th February and was a^lengthy description of his (Mr.Jansen’s) record journey in NIGERIA, and ended by congratulating the Shaikh on the successful termination of the K.O.C. Oil negotiations. (b) On the same day the Shaikh also showed the writer a letter which had arrived from Major Holmes in London, in which the latter acknowledged receipt of the Shaikh’s letter appointing Abdulla al Mulla (son of the Shaikh’s Secretary) as his local Arab representative in Kuwait under the terms of the oil agreement. In the same letter Major Holmes advised the Shaikh that two American geologists and one A.P.O.C. ditto would shortly arrive in Kuwait. Af^TER NOTE . Major Holmes himself arrived in Kuwait on 6 th March 1935 and Messrs Shaw - Rhodes - Growl arrived on 15th March and started work in the hinterland at once. 37 . ATTEMPT ON THE LIFE OF H.M. IBN SAUD AT MECCA . As one writes the summary the news has been received that a dastardly attempt on the king’s life was made on Friday 15th March as he was performing the Haj Tawaf . A copy of the telegram as sent by the Saudi Llinister BaghdadBaghdad to the Shaikh is given below, without comment. 'The Saudi Arabia Legation, Baghdad have the honour to forward the following communique We thank God Who has disappointed His enemies on every occasion and destroyed every design of theirs. The last of these foul designs was when His Majesty the King was going his last turn round the Kaaba at 1 O’clock Arabic time (7 A.M.) on Friday morning just near the 'Hajar-al-»Aswad'. There a man came near to His Majesty and with a dagger in his hand attempted to stab His Majesty. At the same time two other men armed with daggers came from behind. His Highness Amir Saud quickly picked up the man in front to throw him away from His Majesty, but one of His Majesty’s guards simultaneously fired at the assailant and killed him. One of the two assailants coming from behind attempted at His Highness Ameer Saud, but a shot from guards brought him down dead. The third man was also killed. The assilants were identified to be 'Zaidis' from Yemen. Investigations to discover the reasons of the incident and those who had stirred it are being carried out. We thank God Who made the enemies’ designed afctfce attacks return to their own throats. His Majesty the King and His Highness the Crown Prince both completed their going round (Tawaf) as if nothing had ever happened. They are well and in good health and are receiving those who come to wish them a happy ’Id as usual.' 38. RBBBLLION OF TH£ TRIBES ON THE FUPHRATB_S . News came through on the 12 th March of a serious tribal situation on the Euphrates, but failing authentic news, the writer prefers to make no comments. It was later said that the middle Euphrates tribes had sent in an ultimatum to Baghdad demanding . (a) The immediate disolution of Parliament,(b) The resignation of the Cabinet, Failing the Government agreeing to their demands, the tribes said they would march on Baghdad. The leader of the tribes is said to be Abdul Wahid al Haji Sicar, and the instigators of the movement in Baghdad, Yasin Pasha, Hikmatbeg al Suleiman and Al §ailani. 4 - * ‘ Lt-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait.

As this could not be this year, he trusted that he, the Shaikh, would accept an invitation for next year in advance. 28. SHAIKHS DATE GAhl JNS IN IHa^. (a) In a letter dated 15th February 1955, Mr.Gabriel informed the Shaikh that he had it on good authority that the Iraq Government had agreed that the Shaikh should take the famous M oath ft in Kuwait, necessary documents being sent through the Embassy and the Political Agent, Kuwait. (b) This refers to the order of the Basra Courts in a ! recent highly important case between His Excellency and his fellaheen to the effect that he (the shaikh) should proceed in person to Basra and swear 'oath' before the Court that he hadT^ never received certain rentals etc. from his tenants,failing which judgement would be given against him. (c) The news, if true, is very satisfactory and will do much to lessen the unfortunate tension that today exists between Kuwait and Iraq. (d) So far nothing official has come throu^i to confirm the above story. 29.MOVE TO ESTABLISH k ilunl 114 l 1 . Reference para 21 of Intelligence ounmary No.2. The Manager, the eastern nank in Basra, has now written to say that his principals had for the moment abandoned the idea of a bank in Kuwait, ana so wished him to take no further action in the matter. 50.OIL. Major Holmes has informed the Khaikh by letter from London (15.2.55) that the K.0.0. has increased their workingworking capital by a considerable sum, since his (Uajor Holmes') return to London, and that 3 geologists would come out to Kuwait about the end of February or early in arch. Major Holmes added that he himself hoped to aecaapany them. 50.3IK GAUD RI A^H ?Tff YS. On 10th February one fcohamed .acliq al Oabbagh, a member of the well known anti-Lin ^-aud Labbagh family, parsed through Kuwait (by car) en routs to Hiath from Hgypt and Baghdad with the intention of throwing himjself on the ding** mercy. He apparently had been persuaaed by the rest of the family to try his lucll and take advantage of the 'general amnesty' recently proclatried by the King. An eye witness of the man’s meeting with the King at al Khafs, told me on 20th February that at first the ^ing treated him in proper 'cold' fashion, out 3e ter forgrve him — publicly for the part he han playod in the I bn Kifada and Yemen intrigues of his family, and promised to give him back all his property in Mecca and reimburse him for all his other losses. Mohamad aciq was then given a car and sent off to Mecca and to his family (kept as hostages) with the King’s blessings and handsome present. / No doubt the good reception given to this personage, jrill be duly noted by those of the **1 babbagh family still in exile, and should decide them to accept the King’s amnesty. ~ (to) shaikh -hucair ibn ohuualr of the kutajr. This shaikh (mentioned in «;ara 22 of Intelligence nummary No. 2 ) stayed some days in Kuwait after he had visited me, and according to H.E* the nuler (10.2.35) beggeu hard to be allowed to transfer his allegiance from Bin ^auc to Kuwait. His i&amp;cellency adced that the mn stated to him that he, like the rest of the kutair, was so utterly disgusted with the King’s treatment of the tribe generally that he with others only -• ... ■ ■ ;-46- 1 persuaded with diffieulcy/ ^huqair to go hoEiti quietly, and not raise trouble for hiarsell* with the Klag.

POLITICAL AGENT'S TOURS. 4 /u^ # i^i.Ar- SJ (a) On 25th January I proceeded by car to the Southern CV i frontier of Kuwait via the coastal Road and returned the same day. The road after the recent 'cloud burst' was very awkward for cars. (See para 4(e) of Intelligence Summary No.l)• (b) South of Araifjan I found that camps had been prepared for Shaikh Abdulla al Salim al Subah (ruler’s cousin) Shaikh Hillal al Mutairi - Pearl Merchant, Shaikh Abdulla bin idimad al Subah (Ruler’s son), and was told that the Shaikhs themselves would shortly arrive. (c) I called on the Amir of Fahahil, Ibn Dabus in ^he camp and over a cup of coffee the latter discussed coming 'Oil developments' in Kuwait. The Amir expressed the hope that work would start soon, as thousands of Bedouin who were on the border land of starvation, were anxiously waiting to be employed. 14.IMPERIAL AIRWAYS LTD. Owing to the late running of mail aircraft due to weather conditions in Europe and India, four machines both Eastbound and Westbound flew over Kuwait by night without stopping. This rather disorganized the local postal service. One hopes this sort of thing will not happen too often. 15.RAIN SITUATION. (a) Several good showers fell during the period under review, and on 3rd February (though this date strictly speaking should go into my next Report), steady rain fell over the whole of Kuwait State for a period of 11 hourshours without stopping♦ A total of 1.88” was registered. (b) The damage done to the Town was once again considerable, though in a sense the rain came as a blessing in disguise, for several buildings and walls, came down, which had been rendered unsafe for human habitation by the ”cloud burst” of 8th December last, and which the owners refused to demolish. (c) The phenomenal rains that have fallen this year are the subject of much comment among the local Arabs. Never since Kuwait was founded, has 7” of rain (the rainfall ed to date) been recorded, with the rainy season only half finish Gnerally speaking and probably owing to these abnormal rains, the Winter of 1934-35 has so far been one of the mildest on record. (d) Reports from the interior continue to come in of regular showers almost every other day, and the 'grazing situation” not only is good everywhere, but promises to a 'record” year. (e) Only a person who is in intimate touch with the desert and knows of the hideous nightmare of probablye famine for camels and sheep that the Bedouin is faced with almost every season, can fully appreciate what a year like the present one means for the great Nomad tribes of the interior. 'The mercy of G-od” (Rahmat ’Allah) is indeed an apt name, for this blessing of rain. 16.TRIBAL M0m&amp;NT8. (a) Nothing to report, beyond the fact that to the list of the Iraq shepherd tribes, who have entered Kuwait State (See para 5(f) Intelligence Summary No.l) should be added the name BUDUR, under Shaikh Shirshab al Sahan. This tribe normally only operates West of the Batin valley, and migrates from Iraq as far south as the Bushuq area South west of the Tawal el Dhafir (Iraq Neutral Zone), but this year obviously attracted by the promise ofpromise of superb grazing in Kuwait, and the prospect of good prices for their wool several powerful sections of the tribe have come down to Kuwait. (b) The Muntafik Shepherd tribes at the time of writing are still slowly moving south, and are echeloned between Jahara village at the head of the bay of Kuwait and the southern border of the Kuwait Neutral Zone. 17. THE (a) The Kuwait camel Haj Party left in more or less '♦formed' column on the 31st January, and numbered about 1000 souls. No duubt others will proceed later by car. (b) Up to the time of the departure of the Haj, no reply had been received by the Shaikh of Kuwait to his verbal representation (through A1 Nafisi) to Bin Saud in the matter of 'camel' borne pilgrims having to go via Jerriya Ilya. (c) In consequence all camel parties took the law into their own hand, and set out direct for Buraida. (d) The Shaikh decided to detail no special leader or 'Amir' to be in charge of the Kuwait Haji party for the year 1935, instead and by private arrangement with Bin Saud (negotiated directly) it was agreed that he should issue special 'Passes' to all bona fide ' Kuwait Subjects ' doing the Haj, this to differentiate them from Persians, Iraqis or other foreigi nationals who might attach themselves to the Kuwait Haj party. The arrangement will enable Bin Sand' officials (who have orders to tax non-Kuwaitis coming by camel, the sum of 1 Gold Dinar plus 120 Krush) to discriminate between Kuwaitis and others. (See para 7 of Intelligence Summary No.l of 1935). 18. NBJD BLOCKADE. Nothing to report. 19.IRAQ, RELATIONS.19.IRAQ, RaiATIONS» Nothing to report* 20.OIL* Nothing to report, beyond the fact that a Mr.Miller (American Citizen) who is in charge of the Standard Oil survey operations in the Hassa region, passed through Kuwait by Imperial Airways on 30th January 1935 en route to Bahrain* He admitted to the Quarantine Medical Officer on the aerodrome that some of his officers had recently camped and examined the area round al Abrag al Khalija, 20 miles South of the Kuwait Neutral Zone (Vide paras 1 and 10 of Intelligence Summary No.l of 1935)* 21*PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH A BANK IN KUWAIT* On 30th January the Manager of the Eastern Bank at Basra addressed a letter to me and asked if he could come down and see H*E* the Shaikh with a view to opening discussions for the possible establishment of a branch Bank in Kuwait* In reply I advised him to come down and see me at the end of February and have a preliminary talk* Clearly the Eastern Bank are impressed with the possibilities of increased trade etc., which will come as soon as the Kuwait Oil Company get busy. 22.NOTABLE VISITORS* During the period under review the following important tribal persons from the interior visited Kuwait and the Political Agency: (i) Shaikh Mohamed ibn Uthain of the Ajman (exile in Iraq). (ii) Jaali ibn Shaikh Jarraiyid of the Dhafir (lately employed by Major Glubb). (iii) Shaikh Sulaiman al Ruba* of the TUMAN section of the Shammar* (iv) Shaikh Laafi bin Maalath of the Braih (Wasil) section of Mutair (exile in Iraq). (v) Shaikh Shuqair ibn Shuqair of Mutair Ilwa and rai Jerriya. Also the lady 'Amsha' wife of Shaikh Hazza bin Badr of theof the ruling 'Dushan' clan of the Mutair. (b) It is interesting to record that Shaikh Mohamed ibn Uthain is looked up to as a great warrior and raider, and among others of his noteworthy acts, during the Akhwan rebellion of 1929-50, he raided from close to Kuwait, as far south as the Hofuf-Riath road # There he captured a Saudi convoy of 14 motor cars and lorries, killed their defenders and destroyed all the cars by burning. He naturally is not particularly anxious to return to Nejd just yet, though Khalid bin Hathlain recently tried hard to persuade him to accompany^A^ . Shaikh Mohamed recently married the sister of Shaikh Sulaiman al Ruba* of Shammer (c) above, and now resides with his brother-in-law in Iraq. He receives a stipend from the Iraq G-ovemment. (c) Shaikh Laafi bin Maalath is the unfortunate person who 2 years ago incurred the wrath of Bin Saud for refusing to hand over a Mutair tribesman who had brought out a present of one bag of rice (to his,Laafi f s brother) from Shaikh Hillal al Mutairi of Kuwait. Shaikh Laafi knew perfectly well that the patrol who had come for him would take the man to Hufuf and there have him executed. Tribal laws of hospitality forbade that he should hand over a man, who was his guest at the time, so to his honour he ordered the patrol to depart, lest possibly a worse thing happen to it. After this incident Shaikh Laafi feeling that Nejd was no longer a healthy place to live in, secretly migrated to Iraq via Kuwait (his case was fully reported by me at the time). Whilst in Iraq Bin Saud first tried to get him to return sending him messengers with honeyed words. He followed this up by still nicer letters. And finally seeing that 'cunning” was not likely to succeed, he requested the Iraq Government to have him arrested on the charge ofcharge of murdering two of his (Bin Baud’s) soldier^ in Nejd. Shaikh Laafi was duly arrested and was very nearly sent back to Nejd, but by the personal intervention of the late King Faisal (and a second time by King Ghazi) the man was released* V/hat actually saved him was a letter from Bin Baud which he had kept, and in which he was assured by the King that he (Bin Baud) knew that he had done no harm or wrong, and therefore should return to his tribe, where he would be treated with every honour. (d) The lady Amsha is an old friend of both my wife and myself, and was brought in to Kuwait very sick. She was handed over to the good care of the Agency Medical Officer, and at the time of writing is reported to be making good progress. At first we suspected that she had consumption, but this turned out to be incorrect. She is the daughter of Shaikh Faisal bin Shiblan, an old friend and one of the 'aristocrats' of the Mutair tribe.

' V H 3i (Por period 1st January to 15th January 1935}. 1.POLITICAL agents TOURS. (a) I proceeded on i 8th January on a comprehensive tour of the Kuwait Neutral Zone, and returned to headquarters on 11th January. The weather was intensely cold and living with Bedouin in their comfortable though draughty black har tents, was not a pleasant experience. (b) During the tour I travelled down the whole length of the Shaqq depression to Dhullat al Dughaim and idiairish at its extreme lower end and on the return journey spent some time at the wells of ARAq (2 miles inside the Neutral Zone, southern boundary) as well as at Ain al Abd (through which the Southern boundary of the Neutral Zone actually passes. (c) 'Ain al Abd' I found difficult of approach owing to the extensive salt marsh areas which surround it for a considerable depth. The actual 'ain', is quite a remarkable spot, and consists of a large hole in the ground some 60 ft. in diameter, from the centre of which warm clear water bubbles up at the rate of about 1000 gallons a minute and flows to the sea some 10 miles distant. The water is highly impregnated with sulphur, tastes bitter, and gives out a most unpleasant odour which can be smelt a mile away down wind. (d) The actual spring is believed by the bedouin to be haunted. ^ negro 'Jinn' is said to live actually at the bottom of the Spring itself, who occasionally comes out and takes a walk on the banks. Every self respecting Bedouin therefore avoids the place as he would the devil. The storyThe story of the Negro, is given further credence to by the curious phenomenon that takes place in the centre of the pool every few minutes as one watches it. A dark round object (probably a mixture of fungus and mud) appears to surge up in the centre of the swirling water and as quickly disappears again. The Arabs call it the negro, showing his head in an effort to see who disturbs him. (e) In spite of the spring being haunted the marsh country (Muqtaa) surrounding the 'Ain' is a favourite route for Awazim Blockade runners, and in consequence Bin Saud recently placed an armed post to the south of it. Their tents were clearly visible, as I approached the 'Ain'. I also located A1 Bagaawi, Bin saud’s chief Blockade Officer himself, among the AL HAMMA hills to the north-west of Arak wells. He was ostensibly 'hawking' but was combining pleasure with duty obviously. 2. VISIT OF THE CamNDER-IN-CHIEF.EAST INDIES SQ.UAdRON. (a) His Excellency Vice Admiral F.F.Rose, C.B., D.S.O., H.N., arrived in H.M.S.Hawkins on 15th January 1935, accompanied by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division in H.M.S.Shoreham. (b) Usual calls were exchanged on the morning of the 15th, and H.E. the Shaikh gave a banquet in the evening at Dasman palace. (c) On the 16th His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief spent the day 'hawking' in the interior, his host being the Shaikh. (d) H.M.S,Hawkins and H.M.S.Shoreham left Kuwait for Bushire on 16th January (midnight). 3. IMPERIAL AIRY/AYS. The East and Westbound weekly services of Imperial Airways Co.Ltd. were duplicated as from 1st January 1935 and Kuwait is now fortunate in having a bi-weekly air mail service to India and London in addition to the usual mail boat and overland postal services from Iraq. '4./- 3 - 254 4*RAIN SITUATION* (a) Reference para 189 of Intelligence Summary No.12. Further good rain fell all over Kuwait territory during the period under review mostly in small showers, there being only one heavy downpour of 70 cents. The grazing situation therefore for the Nomad population is more than good and desert Truffles are now the fashion at everybody^ table. (b) In the interior, further heavy rain is reported as far as HAIL, and both Summan and inner Nejd have done exceptionally well. (c) Professor UVAROV, Locust Adviser to His Majesty’s Government (Natural History Museum, S.Kensington), who is supplied with local rain reports by me, has issued a warning that the exceptional rains in North east Arabia may quite possibly be followed by a plague of locusts. He reports that some locust swarms have already appeared in North Hejaz. Professor Uvarov’s warning has been passed on to the Shaikh who takes great interest in the matter. (d) It has now come to light that the cloud burst reported in my Intelligence Summary No.12, para 129, so damaged the Kuwait Quarantine Station (the whole upper storey of the building fell in) that the station is no longer habitable. Lack of funds makes it unlikely that repairs will be done, at any rate for some time to come. (e) The same storm washed away the good motor road that runs south from Kuwait town along the coast, and links up the Qusur villages. Intercommunication is now difficult. 5.TRIBAL MOVEMENTS . (At the time of writing this). (a) Kuwait Tribes ( Fidawiyeh and Araibdar). These under the ^mir Haif bin Hajraf ( Ajman) are camped in the northern portion of the Shaqq west of CHABD and SADDA. Large numbers of ^raibdar tents (sheep sections) are also to be found between Araifjan and a line Huzaim- Maragha Wafra (Neutral Zone). Awazim/- 4 - (b) Awazim&gt; (Camel Sections.) under Shaikh Ibn Jama have filled the Shaqq area west of the Neutral Zone and are slowly moving north west* Sheep Sections* - Under Rai al Fahama and other Shaikhs entered the Neutral Zone stortly after 1st January and are camped over the whole of its southern half* (c) Ajman* A few tents have moved up into the Jebel Fowaris sector of the Neutral Zone, but speaking generally, the main tribe remains in their own country round *Nta (Hassa) and further south* (d) _ _Mutair * The tribe as a whole is scattered over the Summan region busying itself with grazing problems* Their Shaikh^ periodically send me letters giving me news, and asking for 12 bore cartridges to hunt 'Hubara', of which they seem to have an abundant supply* (©) The Phaflr* (Afemi. Jaddan and Hantush as Suwait), Have settled themselves down on both sides of the Batin valley in the vicinity of ABRAG Habari and Rigai* COMMENT* Peace and quiet reigns everywhere among the Bedouin of North east Arabia, everyone being too busily engaged in getting his camels and sheep fit again after the long Summer drought, to think of 'troubled (f) 'M untafik' Shepherds* Several of these tribes from the Euphrates, entered Kuwait area from Iraq early in January, and at the time of writing are to be found scattered in large numbers over the whole country North, west and south of Kuwait Bay* This is in accordance with their annual migration rules, and is normal* Daily droves of donkeys bring in supplies of butter, ghi, milk etc* to the Town, and prices of meal and wool have gone right down in consequence* Among the shepherd tribes now grazing in Kuwait,5 Kuwait, are sections of the Aunan ( Bani Malik ), Jawareen , Sharifat and Albu Saleh &gt; Further west and across the Batin are the Budur and the Ghazzi , and beyond than again the Bani Salamah , Ghazalat , Azayad and their allied branches* 6*BIN SAUD AND RIATH InTSIYS* The following interesting items of gossip were given me by a Mutairi falconer (friend of mine since six years, and persona grata with Bin Saud) who was with the King recently on his Hunting Expedition in the Summan region and returned with him to Riath. He came up to Kuwait on 14th January 1935 to see his family: (a) The King hunted east, west, and north from his main camp at Dhahal al Fraih; and under cover of his hawking expeditions appeared to take special interest in the selection of possible sites (for military or customs posts) along the line Hafar al Batin-3afa-Warba-Jerriya- f Nta, i*e. the main wells facing Kuwait. ( This may presage something signi ficant* (b) The King never went as far as Hafar or f Nta, but scoured the country between the other wells, visiting among other places TURAIBI (North-East of his camp) and camping at Urn al Hashim (due west of main camp). (c) All members of Al Saud family except Mohamed (brother joined the King. Ibn Masaad f s son who came with him, went down with smallpox at the Dahal. (d) Faisal joined the King actually at Um al Hashim, and 3 days after protested quite openly to his father at his wasting his time in hunting. The line he took was that his father f s continually absenting himself from business looked very bad in his people’s eyes, and his moving about in the Summan near Kuwait would, he said, be misunderstood by both Kuwaitis and the English. (e) Faisal and Ibn Musaad returned to Riath with the6 with the King and remained with him there several days, owing to heavy rain closing the roads* (f) On 17th day of Rama than Ibn Hathlain (Zeb Sahman) recognized head of the Ajman arrived from Kuwait to submit to Bin Saud (S©e Intelligence Summary No.12, para 132). He was accompanied by 60 iollowers. Bin Saud received him very well,treated him with much honour and feasted him for five days. (g) i'he rumours of jealousy between Faisal and Saud the heir apparent were not true; certainly outwardly both appeared on excellent and even affectionate terms. Neither were the other rumours that were §oiftg I'ound, that Ibn Musa f ad and Ibn Jaloui were at loggerheads founded on any fact. (h) There was however a deep seated and long standing quarrel between Bin Saud and his brother Mohamed (hence the latter’s absence from the shooting camp). Mohamed’s grievance was that while Bin Saud had given the viceroyalties and governorships of Hejaz, Hassa, Hail, and Medina to others, he his own blood brother had hitherto got absolutely nothing.He had waited years for a reward for his loyal adherence, but nothing had eventuated. Bin Saud’s reply had always been and still was, that Mohamed must be near him to assist and support him. He dare not give him a governorship, as it would be most dilfioult, nay impossible, to degrade or dismiss him, should he rule badly. The disgrace would be too much. Such reply naturally failed to M cut ice' or satisfy Mohamed, who not only 'sulked' regularly these days, but had resulted (in the last two years Jin his re fusing to swear d fealty to Saud, the Heir Apparent an annual innovation. When reproached with this by the King some time back,Mohamed had replied that while to him, Abdul Aziz, he would remain loyal to7 (i) (j) to the death, he objected strongly to swear future fealty to a person who if the King died, might not prove at all worthy to hold the reins of power. f, Let the best man win after your death, 01 Brother', is what he is reported to have said to Bin Saud. To mollify Mohamed, the King had given his daughter to 'Khalid' his son, a one-eyed boy of outstanding bravery and spirit, after the latter's return ffom the Yemen campaign. It was this Boy who attempted to murder Saud, the heir apparent, 5 years ago, when he was in the 'hammam” (bath) but in the gloomy light, he had shot and killed Baud's servant instead (A bit of secret history, which few know about). Khalid is today kept continually by the King's side, and is much petted and honoured by the sovereign. The King had become very much 'fatter' in appearance the last few months (the informer expressed the hope that he was not going the way of his father Abdur Rahman, who in later years developed a sort of dropsy), which seemed to affect his movements, and to some extent his mental alertness. (k) Bandar, recognized Shaikh of the Mutair (though not the official nominee) the son of the late Faisal al Duwish, continues to be treated particularly well by the King, who gives him 300 Rials monthly, as well as 16 bags of rice: The King also treats Faisal* wife, the lady 'Aasha' and Humaidi, Bandar's younger brother equally well. (l) The Mutair tribe as a whole are on the other hand still being subjected to much cruel treatment, and Ibn Jaloui is allowed to execute on the slightest pretext, especially those caught blockade runAing from Kuwait. (m) iiin Saud (vouched for as having been obtained from a8 a Clerk of the Treasury) has spent enormous sums of money on entertaining his tribal Shaikhs during the last 3 months* Actually on one day he disbursed 70,000 Rials in gifts. COMMMT. Reference para (m) above. I have heard it said from quite reliable sources in Kuwait that the King (apart from the money he has received from the Standard Oil people must be getting money from some European Power. His Majest Government has been suggested once or twice, but since Fuad Hamza f s visit to Paris last Summer, it is now openly said that he has received a secret loan from France. Certainly both Fuad Hamza and Yusuf Yasin are commonly spoken of by even very pro-Saudi persons, as being in the pay of France. 7♦THE HAJ. On the 14th January, the Shaikh reported that Bin Send had sent him the following verbal proposals (through al Nafisi, his Trade Agent) in the matter of the coming Haj pilgrimage, in as far as it affected Kuwait: (a) ^11 pilgrims from Kuwait were to pass through Jerriya, whether coming by car or camel. (b) No tax would be taken on a Kuwait subject coming by camel. (c) A tax of 1 gold Dinar plus 120 Krush would have to be paid by non-Kuwaitis coming on camel. (d) Kuwaitis going by car to be charged 2 gold Dinars and 120 Krush. (e) Non-Kuwaitis going by car, same as for Kuwaitis(d). (f) Cars after crossing the Dahana sand belt to leave Riath wide on the left and proceed via a laid down road where petrol would be stored and sold at a fixed price. The Shaikh/9 The Shaikh said that he had replied that it would be absurd to ask that camel parties going to Mecca should go via Jerriya, when their ordinary and direct route lay Hafar al Batin and Buraida, a hundred miles to the West - a 1 Nafisi promised to refer the matter. The Shaikh added to me that he would officially report results, but that I was to consider his talk in the light of private information for the present. COMMENT. The Shaikh*s point re camel riders is obviously a very sensible one. B.NDJD BLOCKADE. Nothing to report. 9.IRAQ. H5IATI0NS. Nothing to report. 10.OIL. On 6th January the Shaikh reported that Standard Oil geologists in the employ of Bin Baud, had reached Abrag al Khalija (20 miles south of the south-western frontier of the Neutral Zone) and had pitched camp there. As a result of this information and at the Shaikh*s press wish, I moved into the Neutral Zone for 4 days, to sure thatnone of the geologists through mistaken zeal started operations there. My intention was to get in friend- touch with them if possible, and in case they had not copies of latest maps etc. to show them mine and point out that examination of the Neutral Zone area could not be allowed as both the King and the Shaikh had equal rights there, and any geological survey etc. must have the previous approval of His Majesty’s Government, the protecting Power as far as Kuwait was concerned. I did not find the geologists who were reported to have broken camp and left for Safa again. But to make doubly sure and as I did not want to miss them, I proceeded- 10 - &amp; proceeded to Abrag Khalija only to find that my birds had flown. ll.NOT^BLA VISITORS. (a) His Excellency Shaikh Hafiz Wahba who arrived in Kuwait from London on 29th December, left for Hiath by car on 2nd January. During his visit, he and I had several quite informal though interesting discussions, on such things as Neutral Zone, Oil, and Blockade and smuggling questions. (b) A travelled and interesting Syrian journalist, one Mahmud Khair-ud-Din arrived from Basra on 10th January and left for Bahrain on 14th January en route to India. He stated that he was proprietor of two Damascus journals, and had been in Sana (Yemen) during the Saudi-Yemen War. u*y V His version of events as seen from the Yemeni point of view was illuminating and differed from most of the news received from Saudi sources. For instance he stated that had not the Armistice come when it did Bin Baud would have been heavily attacked all along the line and his communication cut with Hodeida by a large force which had been concentrated at Saada. 12. WIRELESS SETS IN KUWAIT. (a) The period under review has been marked by the curious and sudden desire on the part of every prominent Kuwaiti to own a kadio receiving set. (b) Some 15 sets have been set up mostly Dutch ones from Holland (Phillips), and all are giving excellent results (c) The Shaikh and his notables are naturally most interested in getting the daily news bulletin which is broad cast from Cairo. (d) Cairo broadcasts in English, French and Arabic with almost perfect reception.

(a) In paral 14(a) to (f) of Kuv.*ait Intelligence Summary No. 11 of 1934, I described the excellent rain that fell early in November, and I tried to make clear how this rain had relieved a most serious situation. (b) In section (g) of the same para (114), I stated that 11 Awazlm camels and 2 Kuwait camels were killed by lightning in the Garaa region. Ttois was a mistake, due to the similarity of two words in Arabic (' barak ' meaning lightning and ' barad* meaning hail). Actually the camels were killed by ’’hail' stones which were close on 1' in diameter according to Bedouin reports (o) In section (h) of the same para (114) I said that• 3 - l(*S that many hundTAd^ of had &lt;Ued, a a a result of the soarolty, ]&gt;ter offloial reports showed that the 1os*j approxiiii tted to 2100» (dj On the night of 3rd/4th Deoeciber a woloome drizzle fell over the whole of Kuwait territory and lasted all ni$it. (e) This was followed in the early hours of the rooming of the 7th December (the first day of the Hamadhan fast) by what oan only be called a 'cloua burst'. Without any preliminary warning r in started oominp down in shee^ta at 4 ^continued without a moments stoppage till 5.15 ja.M. It then died down to a drizzle which continued throughout most of the 7th December. (f) Between 4 A.&amp;. and 5.15 A.M. exactly 2* of rain was recorded, a thing unheard of in the whole history of Kuwait. (g The town being mostly built of sun-dried bricks suffered terribly in eonna suence, and houses began to collapse at about 5.30 in the morning and continu-d to fall till ^ afternoon on the 8th. Ilie disaster w is further aggravated by the derkness that reigned in the oarly hours, and by the collapse of many electric light standards which obliged the authorities to switch off the current at the main Power Station. (h) Dawn saw the southern and south-western quarters or the Town which are built or low laying ground, in the grip of floods, which rose to s height of 5 ft. and 6 ft. over a ide srea. The houses all along two iaainjavenues of approach collapsed entirely and only the fact that the townspeople were up at 3.30 a.M. eating their morning meal preparatory far tJ ° 1 irst day's f&amp;st, saved the city from a/greater disaster in the shape of loss of life on a large scale. n * li only 7 persons were killed before they 00 Id escape to safety. ut so suddenly did the floods erlse th ■ t no householder hed ttae to roaiove any of his furniturefurniture and possessions in the badly stricken areas. (i) belief measures were started as soon as the rain stopped, but as undermined houses kept on falling throughout the 7th December and so rendered movement along the flooded streets extremely dangenous, nothing much could be done till the morning of the 8th December* The writer himself had a particularly narrow escape as he was riding girth deep on his horse down one main avenue in an effort to supervise and organize rescue work, for not 50 foot in front of him a double storeyed house collapsed in a matter of 3 seconds, and desappeared in the flood waters. (J) Altogether 255 houses great and small fell level with the ground, not a wall being left standing, while some 700 other houses received serious damage in some form or another. (k) The number of persons rendered homeless has been officially computed at 1275. The Shaikh realising the magnitude of the disaster, started e relief fund on the 9th December and himself headed the subscription list with a donation of Fs.5000/-. The fund now stands in the vicinity of Hs. £0,000 and more continues to come in. tfafortunately no rebuilding of houses can commence till the Spring arrives, as mud bricks and mud walls can only bo made when the sun gets hot. (l) * bright feature of the relief work was the wonderfully cheery domeanour of those who suffered, and the keenness which existed among the more lucky householders to take in and look after refugees. (m) lurther light rain fell on 11th and 12th December and again on the 16th December which handicapped salvage work not e little. 130/T3IB- L ^OYFMTNT'-'. 130# (a) There is nothing to report under thin head beyond the feot that the hinterland tribes ore inexpressibly delighted with the r?in described in the previous paragraph.

At the end of June 1934, and owing to lack of grazing in Kuwait last ummer, one Ghanim bin Mohamed, servant of Shaikh Abdulla al Jabir, cousin of the Ruler, took his flock of 460 sheep to the southern shore of the Hamar Lake (Iraq), leaving his family camped at Sabbiyeh (opposite Kuwait Town), a party of his Awa/im friends also accompanied him with their respective flocks. Ghanim stayed with his sheep till the beginning of August, and returned to his family at Babbiyeh, leaving behind his brother alim to look after the animals. On 19th October, Ghanim again left for Iraq (to see his flock) accompanied by five others and a donkey. On reaching Shaiba he an t two of his companions took train for Al Tuba station, while the rest of the party proceeded afoot.

In the morning the whole country side was a series of small lakes. It was pathetic in the extreme to see the way in which at 3 A.i •, camels and sheep struggled to reach and drink from the rain water pools, the first Wc sweet wster they had tasted since the spring of 1934, and ^edouin men, women and children paddled about trying to fill goat skins and every other utensil that would hold the precious fluid.

They arrived independently at Kuwait. Their evidence tallied in most respects. uaong the items of interest reported by them were the following:- (a) They had had hard fighting round Baqum prior to the occupation of Nejren and had been driven back Tith the loss of a gun from that village, ^helr losses had been 50 killed. (b) They were much impressed with the blue clad fighting men of Yemen, who they likened to locusts in number. (o) They were allowed to enter Nejran by the Yemenis obviously of set purpose, but would have found it hard to hold, if hostilities bad gone on, for the Yaaen forces held the very mountainous region,- 7 - region 9 oloae up to the oesU, and dominated them all the time. (d) Nejran itself was a Ion* fertile valley extending from the great mountdin barrier of Yomen proper and gradually spreading out into a wide open plain Down the centre was a belt of palm groves lying on both sides of a broad dry water course. Many villages existed in the fertile belt and the palm trees extended in a Korth-^ast direction (like Hoffuf and its environs) for some 12 miles. (e) audi cars were able to get right into the Nejran valley, but could not have hoped to get beyond owing to the mountains. (f) ’ations were very scarce, and clothing was brought from Bejaz and was sold to the soldiery in return 'or money. aael meat was the common diet also a little rloe of had quality. (g) hen peace was arranged, and the troops withdrawn, a small Saudi garrison was left In Nejran under an Sair* l (h) Both informants were emphatic that Bin baud made peace out of '’fear'. His only hope was to extricate himself from a bad business. This he did with his usual skill and because Imam Yahya was old and wanted an end to killing. T A XM ji . RUMOURS. ilQ# The latest bazaar gossip from Riath is that Bin baud will make no move (if he ever makes one) until after 'Haaathani' This is confirmed to me by two Ajman tribesmen who I know and who recently returned to Kuwait from Yemen. Whilst In Dlath they apparently expressed the hope to Bin Jaud’s standard bearer, that perhaps there was a chance of winning more ’’booty' Talma way than he had got in Nejran.The answer was oryptlo and somewhat as follows: 'Go home now and see your ft allies, but If you want to see fun return here imnediately after 'amathan rT # ^-1 1 « lid* (a) The Kuwait Oil Company appear at last to be asking 'progress' toward© the attalrmeat of their alas, and there seem^good prospect of scjciethinA ha penln# before the Ramathan feet* Actually one urderstands that the Company have agreed to the Shaikh's finaLeial terns, and that the Shaikh will now write a letxer to the negotiators asking than to embody one or two fresh points in the Draft Agreement• (b) The Standard Oil of California who hare the Rasra Concession have again become active* Two imericen geologists set out from Jubail in cars &amp;bout 12th i ovember, and were ^ recently reported to hare reached .^erriya and af« in the v ?4uteir country* (140 A*^* of uwait)* heir well known red aeroplane with wings that fold apparently visits the party daily* (c) hen last heard of the geologists had reached and were examining the JAU al Thor depression (See Ju ea ZOR 4b miles South- est of iafa on million 3heet)* CQMU.CNT.

It was told the writer by the shaikh}- Apparently about 8th November, a party of 18 /naze (Dahcmsha) Bedouin who were engaged on a smuggling expedition reached Jahara, outside Kuwait. 'They had come down from near i^ejef in Iraq. Hear Jahara they met 8 Jhaxamar tribesmen with a caravan of 25 camels proceeding from Kuwait to Iraq. The Shammaria also were engaged in smuggling. The naze party recognized the whole of the Lhmamar camels as having beer: raided from them some few weeks beck, ao held up the robbers and demanded that the camels be returned. The latter refused and a fight was about to take place, when the shaikh’s Amir appeared on the scene, arrested the lot (both sides) and brought every one into Kuwait. The shaikh personally tried the cose, and decided that the 25 emnel* were all stolen (after every member of the Shammer party had one by one admitted the fact). / He then ordered the leader of the JUmaze to go back to Iraq and get an order frorc the local Government to the effect that the camels were the property of the Dahamshf . In the meantime everyone else was to remain in Kuwait. As the Anaze man was about to leave, a messenger otsme hot haste from one *»bdul Jabber Sffendi, Officer in charge of the Iraq Southern Desert Police, addressed to the fhaikh, asking that the 25 camels be handed over to his friends, the party of oiaze maugglers, as thqy belonged to them etc. etc. Ihe Shaikh went one better and sent camels as well as men to afwan Police Post on the frontier under escort, with instructions to the sergeant there to take charge of the case, in collaboration with Abdul bahbar Sffendi.IS - AJTffi MOTS. } sferenoe p«ra 116 ( 9 ) above. * 1.8 this goes to poet (£5.11.54) an express camel courier fcae juat reached Kuwait reporting the arrival of sUM. the lug in the i urn an with a large retinue and tome 80 motor care.

Pearling Season, The pearling season was officially closed on the 2nd October 19 34, by His Bxceliency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as-Sabah, K.C.I.A., C.S.I., Ruler of Kuwait, who visited the pearling banks in his yacht, for the purpose. The pearling boats started arriving back on the 3rd October, when Kuwait rt Niqa TT (inner harbour) was a scene of great excitement. The season’s pearl catch was exceptionally poor - less than half in value of that of the previous season. Only one Kuwait boat was lucky enough to get a ?T Hasba n (big pearl) which fetched Rs.14,000/-, while only half a dozen other pearls fetched prices ranging from Rs.3,000 to Rs.6000• One old and prominent pearl merchant told the3 told the writer that the trouble lay in the fact that the oysters nowadays seemed to be failing to produce pearls and the number of oysters caught which failed to produce a pearl was very greatly in excess of what was the case 10 to 15 years ago. He opined that possibly (a} Poison from the Oil Refinery at Abadan or Oil driven ships in the Gulf were affecting the productivity of the oyster beds: ■b) fhat the beds were getting worked out seeing that 7/hat with ' if Radda Tf and 'Khanchiyeh” seasons, as well as the rt Ghaus n proper the said beds only get 3 months rest in the year. Re further opined that matters had grown so serious, that it behoved the ’.ulers of Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Trucial vOast to petition His Majesty's Government to appoint a 'Commission' to make thorough enquiry into the matter, with a view to making recommendations for (a) Closed season on certain Banks.

(a) The hopes entertained by the writer that the good rains Y/hich fell on 14th May 1934 (See Intelligence Summary Ho.3 of 1934, and para 33) would rovide satisfactory grazing for the Bedouin of Kuwait and the interior have been sadly falsified. (b) Apparently the above rains did result in young grass coming up, but the heat of the sun scorched it up before it was inch high, or could be of any benefit to sheep and camels. (c) As no rain fell at all during the v/inter of 1933-34 (already reported at the time), the need for fresh grass for the summer of 1934 was doubly necessary. (d) The situation was aggravated by the influx of the great Awazim tribe with their enormous herds of camels andand sheep, during the sprin of 1934, not to i.ention stron, sections of the I utair, 3ani IChalid, -dwan, ..ab, aashaida. -hese, if it be recollected, entered Kuwait as a precautionary measure (they, feared that Bin Saud was about to be defeated in Yemen, and spread over the whole of lluwait and the adjacent territories like a plague of locusts - when they finally returned to their own lands in June, they left a desert 7 /here before there had been sufficient dry ’klrfaj' and r, Nassi* f grass to enable the Kuwait tribes to have supported life d ur ing the Sum le r.

(f) The camels of the above tribes have fared somewhat better than the sheep and are doing their best with what Arfaj can be found in the Subaihiyeh district, the Kuwait i.eutral -jone and the Gar’aa region between the Bhaq and Kafar al Batin. (g) Speaking generally and by areas we have the follow ing situation early in November.

Have returned to autumn areas in Hassa. hashaida. • lest of S^ubaihiyeh and in Kuwait Neutral Zone. noteworthy event connected with this tribe took place in dune of 1934. Ibn Musaillim, paramount Shaikh of the tribe with some 60 tents transferred his allegiance from Bin Baud to the Shaikh of Kuwait (See para 54(vi) of Intelligence Summary No.Sfor May 1954). Ibn Musaillim has been given a plot of land in Kuwait town, behind the Shaikh 1 s palace and has already built a residence for himself and immediate followers with the assistance of the Shaikh of Kuwait. The6 ggy The incident is interesting, as showing that Bin Saud f s hold over his Bedouin tribes is growing weaker and may be put down to the result of the Yemen campaign. A year ago this move would not have been possible. Tor the information of those who do not know local politics, the Hashaida (a serf tribe of the Mutalr ) have always been looked upon as a Kuwait group and the particular fighting men of the Shaikh of Kuwait. ./hen the Mutair became good 'Akhwan' and were taken by Bin Saud from Kuwait the Rashaida who own much property in Kuwait Town refused to follow. During the troubles of 19E0-27 when Kuwait was being raided almost daily by the Akhwan of Bin Saud, the Shaikh of Kuwait unable to protect the large flocks of sheep and camels belonging to his Rashaida, gave Ibn Musaillim a free hand to join the Akhwan if by so doing he could save his animals. Ibn Musaillim accepted the offer, went over to Bin Saud with 2/3 of the Rashaida and so saved the tribal wealth. Neither he nor his followers ever became true Akhwan, and always maintained secret allegiance to the Shaikh of Kuwait and promised to come back when the chance offered. 102 . BUT SAUD AND YSLSiN CAMPAIGN. (a) z ince the writer returned f/rom leave, he has^ound many opportunities of discussing past Yemen events with a number of Bedouin trans-border chiefs, as well as with the Shaikh of Kuwait and notables of the Town. . On all aides he has been told that Bin Saud has definitely lost much 'prestige' as a result of the 'Jar. Everywhere the belief is very strong that had Bin Saud been strong enough, nothing in the world would have prevented him from over-running or crushing Yahya. He however found himself in imminent danger after his seizure of Hodeida, of being surrounded and his armies destroyed so he wisely obeyed the instincts of self-preservation and made the peace he did. Yahya was also satisfied, being an i7 being an old man and without aggressive ideas - for had he not won the moral victory and forced Bin Baud to withdraw, without so much as surrendering an inch of Yemen territory, or paying a rial by way of indemnity? (b) The barren Ilejran after all was no gain to Bin Saud, but has merely been given to her ovm people, the Yam tribe, who are blood brothers of the Hurra and Ajman tribes (c; The above is the appreciation of the situation among ^in dauds great tribes and the people of Kuwait, and I believe sums up the situation correctly* (d) Since the King f s return to Riath he has been generously rewarding the Shaikhs and other prominent persons who helped him in the 7/ar, with money gifts, but has refused to receive at all those who failed to answer - xs call oo arms. The latter are all known, and their names have been recorded carefully, and they will no doubt oe dealt with when Bin Saud feels himself strong enough to do so. V (e) According to Ibn Mussaillim of the Rashaida, Bin Gaud is now universally hated, where in the old days he was respected and even loved. One of the causes that have brought about this, is worth recording. Apparently in the past when two sections or individuals of a tribe quarrelled and broke the peace, he, Bin Saud,used to investigate the case carefully and punish the wrong-doer. Today he ferociously seizes the best property in camels and sheep of the whole tribe for allowing, as he says, the incident to have happened. The Bedouin in other words, feel that the innocent as well as guilty are being punished and resent it in proportion. (f) To distract attention from himself and once more dangle oefore the eyes of some of his stalwarts the idea of oooty, it is widely stated that he has recently been talkir^r much of another campaign. TAIMA. RUMOURS.104, i:any Bedouin rumours of a _&gt;audi campaign against Talma have been current during October, Latest reports (29.10.34) from Hail, and/brought into Kuwait by one of the Shaikh f s Shammar retainers, are to the effect that Abdul Kerim ibn Bum..ian of Taima (12 days journey on camel west of Hail) is now well in the black books of Bin Saud, and that the latter has sent orders to Bin Kusa’ad, Governor of Brail to proceed against him, extract back taxes and generally punish him. Ibn I.Iusa’ad has accordingly given out that he is proceeding to Palestine to punish the Yahud (Jews) and has ordered large Shammar contingents to rendezvous at JAUB. Ibn Rumman in the meantime naturally suspects that he is the intended victim and is said to have filled in the wells far and near on Hie routes leading to Taima and is preparing to resist. COmiSNT. The Shaikh of Kuwait places little credence on the above reports, as he says Bin Saud obviously must have time to recover from the effects of the Yemen War. At the same time for Ibn Musa 1 ad to take the trouble to say that Palestine is his objective in a coming large raid and that he wants to punish the Jews (a report which many Bedouins confirm) is somewhat suspicious. The fact also that several large cara vans of Rice and dates are reported to have recently left Jubail and Hoffuf for Hail makes the writer think that something may be in the wind. 105.SAUDI BLOG:ALL OP KUbAIT. (a) This during the summer months appears to have lost some of its severity. Certain it is that Awazim tribes men have been coming *into Kuwait in large numbers and most regularly during September and October. It is true these come in mostly from the Neutral Zone, where many are camped, but no doubt they pass on their supplies to their brethren south of the border. (b) According to the Shaikh, several cargoes ofcargoes of food-stuffs have been purchased by merchants of Jubail and Jinneh from Kuwait during September and October and have been successfully dumped on the coast of Kassa. (c) The Shaikh puts down the comparative ease with which goods are now going into Nejd, to loss of ,r prestige ?t on the part of Bin Saud which has adversely affected the mentality of his frontier officials. How long this will continue remains to be seen, however. (d) During October (15th) a number of merchants frcm Nejd came up to Kuwait and purchased a goodly supply of carpets and Abbahs (cloaks) and shipped them to Nejd via Ojair. This is the second occasion that this has happened during the sumr.er of 1934. On their first visit they bought £.2000 worth of goods. The merchants came with the authority of the King and the goods appear to be destined for His Majesty himself. 106.PURCHASE 0? I,IAAIA THBAHZ^ DOLLARS BY BIN SAUD IN KUV/AIT. Since the beginning of September, quantities of dollars (II.T.) have been steadily being bought up by Saudi Agents operating in Kuwait. These have been sent to Riath, apparently for the use of the I ling. The result of these transactions has been that the price of dollars rose during October from Rs.83/- per 100 dollars to Rs.103. CQLZ.'IBNT. It seems reasonable to suppose that the dollars are intended by Bin Saud to rev/ard those who went to the Yemen war with him. Dollars are preferred by the Bedouin of the Desert to any other currency. 107.IRAQ, AND SIJJQ-G-LING PROH KU7/AIT. (a) Since the writer returned from leave on 16th October 1934, he has mace many enquiries as to the steps taken during the summer of 1934 by the Iraq G-overnment to combat the smuggling which they are never tired of accusing10 235. accusing Kuwait of fostering. Among other things the writer paid two visits to the Northern and North- Western frontier ^ _ i ?ipari ty . o ± ind out ''or himself by nersonal enquiry what actually was going on. ' J; ^ -eels it . is duty to record the melancholy fact that apparently only 6 men under a Chaoush are expected to hold the frontier line of 150 miles. These six men are permanently posted at Safwan, are Immobile as far as one pparently onl f cars that ply between Kuwait and Zubair. They are indeed the only visible evidence along the whole desert frontier of the steps that are being taken by the Iraq Oovernsent to combat the smuggling problem. ^ c ^ ihere are, it is true, 2 old Chevrolet armed cars which act as support to the above six men, but these are stationed at Zubair some 50 miles from the frontier and cannot affect the situation much. One could get no evidence tnat these cars ever went down the Western side of the ironuier ao far a., nigai or. tne ^audi ..rabian border. ^ ./hile it is not for us in Kuwait to pass remarks as to how ones neighbours should manage their affairs, it is sadly clear to the writer that such poor preventive measures as ao present exist, are hopelessly inadequate (to use a mild phrase) .or dealing with the type of Iraqi smuggler, 7 rho operates in bands of 2 0 to 50 tough and well armed men, all prepared zo fight anyone who stand in their way. (e) Cne cannot but help thinking, that the Iraq Govern- x.i-o • o... se . j3U J • _ v combatting the trouble themselves from their side of the frontier, but prefer to hope that by shoutin ; enough, and accusing Kuwait loudly enough of not cooperating, to bluf ' the Shaikh into ca rying uhe oaby ' and doing all the spending. (i/ ^part from the expense question, there would annear also to be a definite tendency for preventive officers to avoid aking on' .neir own Iraqi tribesmen engaged in the smuggling. One/11 - 11 - 224 One wonders what is behind this. v (g) Ourely it' should not be beyond the v:it or Iraq ollicials interested in stop ing snug linp # to devise sonj iiiore effective system than at present exists, consisting as one has pointed out before of a combination of Police xosts, car patrols, and friendly Bedouins working in cooneration. / Lt. -Colonel, Political n;ent, Kuwait. -oliticcl agency, Kuwait.

(c) Shaikh Abdulla as-Salim, accompanied by his two younger brothers (Fahad and Sabah), Shaikh Ali al Khalifa, and shaikh Sabah an-Nasir, all cousins to His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait, proceeded on an excursion to Failika Island on the morning of 29th July. It is understood that they will spend a week or so there and then return to Kuwait. (d) A party of about 25 destitute pilgrims, all Sunni Persians from Ramadan, arrived here fran Hassa by u a sailing ship on 31st Jly 1934. They had arrived in Kuwait from ersia via Iraq some 5 months ago and had proceeded on the HaJ to Mecca and Medina by camel caravan. According bo their statement, on their return to Mecca, several of their party fell ill, which held up their departure and exhausted their resources. They appealed for help to the Saudi Authorities who assisted them with money and transported them in a State Lorry from Mecca to ksdinax Riath. The party is still camped at Kuwait, outside the Town walls, endeavouring to collect money to enable them to continue on their way to their own country. 82.DESERT HEWS. (a) The news has come in through several, more or less reliable, sources, that mystery surrounds the whereabouts of Amir Saud, the Heir Apparent and Governor General of Nejd, who had lately led the Saudi campaign against the Imam of Yemen through Nejran. He is said to be neither in Hejaz nor in Nejd. Saudi Authorities, however, maintain that he is still in Nejran, pacifying the country there, but the Bedouin element doubt the truth of this statementthis statement and go so far as to believe that the Heir Apparent was long killed in one of his encounters with Yemen troops. (b) Another rumour, subsequently received (28.7.34) through a private source from Nejd, would seem to corroborate the above and add that certain Nejdi tribes had recently displayed signs of agitation against Saudi regime. Ibn Saud, it is said, had to arrange a special visit to Riath, the Capital of Nejd,' in the middle of July, in order to disarm the malcontents. (c) Despite the above precautions taken by Ibn Saud, it seems that^certain amount of dissatisfaction and a tendency to disobedience still prevails among some of the Nejdi tribes. The following story which has come in from the Desert, throws light on the situation:- SQme tribesmen of the Harb Section (Ruled by Al-Firm) attacked several of the Shammar tribes men near Hail and killed a few of them. The Chief of Shammar complained to Ibn Musa’ad, Amir of Hail, who wrote to Al-Firm asking him to hand over the culprits to him (Ibn Musa T ad) at once. The Al-Firm Chief refused to comply and turned away Ibn Musa ? ad r s messenger. NOTB.

In the early part of the fortnight under report a rumour was received to the effect that Ali ibn al Wazir, brother of Abdulla ibn Wazir, Yemeni delegate to the Peace Mission, had rebelled against the Imam. The aboveThe above All ibn Wazir, it is said, had been in supreme command of Yemeni troops prior to his forced resignation in favour of Saif al Islam, Imam Yahya’s eldest son. According to the same news, Ali ibn Wazir had been long cherishing hopes of ruling Yemen; and with that end in view and also taking advantage of the Imam’s difficulties vis a vis King Bin Saud, had conducted a well organized rebellion against Imam Yahya. The news remained uncorroborated throughout the fortnight under review, and can now therefore probably be safely discredited.

The whole of that day a strong 'Shamal rt wind reaching almost gale force at times had been blowing,blowing, accompanied by dense clouds of fine dust. Visib lity was in consequence low* Just after 7 P.M. when the light was failing the n H 0 lena n suddenly appeared over the Town and landed on the aerodrome. The pilot stated that the strong head winds and lack of visibility had so delayed him that he only had an hour’s or so petrol in hand and had therefore decided to stay the night at Kuwait. The local aerodrome consists only of a landing ground and there are no hangars. Luckily the wind continued to blow steadily from the north all night and the machine was able to get protection under the shelter of the Town walls. There is no rest house or proper accommodation for passengers by air at Kuwait. With great difficulty, accommoda -tion, food, bedding etc., were obtained for the 8 passengers at a house belonging to the A.P.O.C. which was put at their disposal by that Company’s representative. »» M The Helena departed early the following morning. 61.KING’S BIRTHDAY. His Majesty the King’s Birthday was celebrated here on 4th June 1934.

The flagstaff of the Political Agency and that of His Excellency the Shaikh’s Town Palace, were, as usual, dressed A for the occasion.

Th© Awazim Bedouin who are one of the richest tribes in livestock in Arabia clearly cannot afford to risk a return to their homes in North Hassa, until they get definite news that all is going well with Bin Uaud in r amfin. The reason for this is that their neighbours, notably the Mutair, AJman and ohammar have always had few sheep and camels as compared with thorn and are for ever casting covetous,eyes on their flocks. They (the Awazira) are fully aware that should Bin Gaud suffer a defeat or serious reverse, at once would go out the signal that they were fair game, and a swarm of enemies would fall upon them fron every quarter. They prefer therefore to await events in Kuwait, and both ibn Jaloul and Bin Baud himself appear to realize the position, end sire making no efforts to get the tribe back. At first shortage of grazing brou^it the Awazia to Kuwait: Now uncertainty of the War situation is keeping them from returning. ili/-4 l.y».yy,?, ( M Ilwa Seotione) # have all moved back for the Summer season to their oen country the 'Sunnaan'.

No one here can quite say why this was done but according to Mutair (Braih) reports, he suffered this fate as a result of a request made to the Iraq Government by Bin Baud's Minister in Baghdad (ibn Ma'amar).

Eleven motor cars carrying pass angers to various Spring camps of Kuwait residents in the ; outh were also fog- bound for a day and night. (e) Following the dust-storm a depression which seems to have formed somewhere in the direction of JAOT Oasis started moving towards the Batin region and reached the ay of &gt; twait on 1st April. There was violent thunder and lightening throughout the night of the 2nd,and day of 3rd 'pril, which culminated in a widespread downpour of rain. This lasted the best pert of 15 hours. The depression then moved ^outh-Kast into the Persian Gulf and apparently again struck the Arabian shore at Bahrain where the yal Air Porce reported stormy weather and rain on 7th April. (d) The whole of the Northern and Central portion of Kuwait get copious rain, but the extreme southern border got nothing, nor as far as can be gathered did North Hassa or any part of Bin ^aud’s territory in the interior.

This is satisfactory as far as it goes. (e) A curious but unconfirmed report reached Kuwait on 20th March to the effect that the ‘Iraq Government had appointed a certain Ghent ;ar tribesman named udald a I ^hamrarl to try and deal with certain ’Iraqi smugglers, who, with great boldness were conducting their operations between Kuwait, Kerbela and Nejef.

VI. POU HCaL TOlfflL. (a) On the 17th March, 21st March end again 25th March the writer made extensive tours of tha area west and i.orth«* vVest of Kuwait with the special object of visiting the Hassa and Nejd tribes who had entered Kuwait territory (fee para III. above)• (b) The la»t of these tours took him all over theover the Ujrah - __ lkaka - ja w tati. and tm a i Madafa are© (c) The oamps of the following leading liutren, Banl Khalid, ashalda *iiid i^Jican ohaikha were visited: !• Uajld al xvsgar Hidden aa ur (lutair) Farhan ibn Khudhalyir (Kuwait Uutalr) Al Jazi (liutalri wife of tho late : hnikh lubarak of Kuwait)* 2. ^aleh al Niiaran Addas al t?imran Ibn oweliat n 3* Ibn Kendll (Ban!

This would have been amusing had it not been sad. All had A clearly suffered at the hands of Bin Saud, end many showed slgne of hunger and starvation, more especially the Mutair. They, one and all, certainly feared that I was about to evict than. I did ray best to reasnure them. As regards (2) above: Although my last tour among thesethese Kfijd tribes was on 25th ;:arch t all of them appeared to be perfectly well aware that hostilities had broken.out between their a»ster and Yahya in far off Yemen. This was the more strange seeing that the official news only reached Kuwait on Seth fcaroh in the shape of a telegram from the Hon’ble the loll tioal Resident who wa« at Bahrain. The effect of the news on the tribea was that the 'omaller fry% almost under my eyae, began to close in on their i haikhS tents, aiid the latter in turn to concentrate into groups; for example the liutair, iushaida, Adawin, lab, iiani llhalid started grouping thomselres in the estern half of the rrlnoipality, along the Batin, while the strong iwazira (ene mies of the Uutsir) started moving to the Eastern side of the Kuwait-v.afvsan ix^au. It was all vory atriking and quite patent that should Bin £nud suffer a aerious reverse or ever go under the Wejd tribes will at once fly at each others throats and the days of the blood feud will once more prevail. M Verily', as one shaikh saia, 'the bedouin 1 s hand i® against everyman, and everyman 1 s hand is against him'. And more than ever Is it clear that Bin baud’s strong am alone prevents chaos* among, his people. /II* RIATH ii ; ■ &lt; ■ -. TH.:. IK r^5M. On 84th Maroh.

VISITORS. 1. BRITISH SUBJECTS. Flight Lieut. E.J.Howes, Special Service Officer, Basra, arrived on the 6 th April and returned to Basra on the 9 th. 2. FOREIGNERS. (i) On the 8 th April the following visited Kuwait (a) Dr.Fritz Grobba (and wife), German Minister, Bagh dad; (b) Monsieur Lepissier (and wife) French Charge’ d'Affadres at Baghdad; (c) Dr .Hermann Suedhof, German Educational Expert attached to ’Iraq Government; (d) Monsieur Albert Asfar, French Consular Agent, Basra. (ii) The trip appeared to have been very hurriedly- conceived and arranged, for only eleventh hour intimation was given of the party’s proposed arrival to the Political Agent. This neglect of the ordinary official courtesy, caused great inconvenience, and was very unfavourably cannient ed on by His Excellency the Shaikh in a protest which he made to the writer. On the 7th April a short note was received by the Political Agent from Count Asfar, the French Consular Agent at Basra, enquiring if accommodation for one night would be available for the party either in the Political Agency or His Excellency the Shaikh’s guest house. A telegraphic reply in the negative was imnediately despatched to the effect that His Excellency the Shaikh was out in camp and his Palace locked up and that all available accommodation in the Political Agency was taken up by the passengers andpassengers and officers of the stranded Imperial Airways liner (See Kuwait Intelligence Summary for March, paralX). Inspite of the above reply the party arrived on Sunday the 8 th April, preceded by a short telegram saying they could not put off their visit, idiich telegram was received only a couple of hours before Hie party did. (iii) The writer inspite of the inconvenience caused, did his best to meet the emergency and offered the hospitality of the Political Agency such as it was and showed the party romd the town, and bazaars, and did all he could to enter tain the distinguished visitors. The writer was unable, however, to offer them food, as he had another party on in his house, consisting of Captain and Mr.s.Howes and officers of the Imperial Airways machine stranded in Kuwait. (iv) The visitors neither called on nor left cards on His Sxeellency the Shaikh, and left for Basra at 2 P.M. the same day after having taken their picnic luncheon (brought by them from Basra) in the new Agency Building. (v) From certain pointed questions re Oil matters, which were put to the writer by the German Minister as well as the French Charge 1 d*Affaires, it did not require much imagination to see that the party’s visit was in some way connected with Oil. COMMENT. The B.O.D. Company consist, one believes, of British, French, German, Italian and Swiss interests. ROYAL AIR FORCE. 5. (i) Four Royal Air Force Wapitis and two Flying boats landed in Kuwait on the 7th April and took ofT after a couple of hourii stay here for Bahrain. The latter are on their annual cruise of Gulf stations. (ii) On 15th April, it was reported that one /apiti had forced landing at Abu Dhabi and another at Shargah and that two spare engines had been called ^or. (iii) As this Summary is about to be typed, a report has ocme in (18.4.34) that one of two R.A.F.Victorias, con- veying spare engines for (ii) abore had forced landing in'2^&gt; in a marsh, West of Jinneh Island, North of Jubail (Saudi Arabian territory) and was badly 'bogged” in some old marshy land there. It is understood that Political Agent, Bahrain is attending to the matter. IMI ; BHIAL airways. 4. (i) On 6 th April the Eastbound plane whilst refuelling at Kuwait (See Intelligence Summary for March, para IX) was struck by a sadden squall which damaged a wing. Repair parts have had to be got from England, and at the time of writing the machine is still in Kuwait and will probably be here till 28th April. (ii) A careful study of the 'Persian Gulf Pilot' will show that during April and the early part of May the northern end of the Gulf is liable to sudden fierce squalls and whirl winds, which may come from any direction and at a moments notice. The Arabs call the season ' Barah ul Thuraiya ' and look upon it as a particularly dangerous period for seamen. It was one of these squalls that damaged the plane and took the pilot unawares. LOCAL INTERESTS. 5. LAW &amp; ORDER. (i) Some half a dozen mysterious cases of petty theft took place in Kuwait Town during the period under review. The bobberies followed each other in dose succession, and at a time whan the majority of prominent Kuwaitis were out camping in the dasert after the recently reported good rains. A common feature of every case was that entry into houses was effected by making holes in the walls. Chief among the victims were as follows: (a) Husain bin *Isa, a prominent pearl merchant; (b) Shaikh Abdulla bin ivhmad and Mohamed bin Ahmad sons of His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait, who live in town in His Excellency’s old house; (c) Sultan bin r Isa, a prominent merchant. (ii) On the 14th instant, a curious incident gave the Police/Police a clue , which was followed by the quick apprehension of one of the robbers, and the arrest of the whole gang on the 16th. The story of the due is reported to be as follows: jn the afternoon of 14th instant a small boy was playing near the Customs premises on the seashore. Searching xor worms for his bird-trap, he went near a water tank, which was lying there, and saw one comer of a rug protruding from beneath it. The boy ran home and told his brother about the rug, who in turn informed Ike Chief of the Police. The latter hurried to the spot with a couple of policemen and recovered from under the water tank some of the stolen rugs, ornaments and clothes etc. Further search in a Persian dhow, iriiich was lying dose in shore led to the discovery of the rest of the stolen property and one sailor asleep inside the boat. The man was i mediately taken into custody and on examination next day was found to be innocent, but he was able to furnish information which led to the apprehension of the ring leader of the robbers, a Persian from Tangistan ^ and the Nakhuda of the dhow. By and by the rest of the robbers were also arrested. (iii)The case is being tried in public amidst crowds of people, young and old, who form a procession and go sing ing in chorus and clapping hands, ahead of the accused as they go to 1he Court from their cells and vice versa. DES3RT AM) NEJD NEWS. 6 .HAIN SITUATION. (i) See Kuwait Intelligence Summary No.C-129, dated the 10th April giving rain situation up to 7th April. (ii) No further rain fell between the 7th and 15th April in the principality, but good rain was reported in the Summan region (Mutair tribal country) and fair rain in the Hazaim Saluh and Suda coastal regions of the Kuwait Neutral Zone Hassa. This is said to have fallen on and 13th/- 6 - only the fact that it has not yet been substantiated is keeping things quiet. (e) Taking everything into consideration, the Awazim cannot be blamed if they think the time suitable for a move in a more healthy direction. (f) They remain strong, prepared and concentrated, and their shaikh recently expelled all strangers serving as shepherds among them, as a precautionary measure. (lii)(a) Banl Khalid)(Ahl al Jariya), under Shaikh ibn Mandil, keeps close company with the Mutair and is reported to be still in the Dakaka region of Kuwait (norlihern end of Shaq). (b) The Bani Khalid elements under Shaikh Abdul Muhsin bin Muhanna al Khazar of Qatif have returned to the Neutral ^one and are camped itest of Wafra in the Saluh region. (iv) (a)Mutair (Ilwah and -.asil) • Many sections of this tribe continue to be echeloned southward from Hauma(north-west Kuwait) to Hafar al Batin 60 miles south of Kigai. (b)At ihe time of writing the following Shaikhs Shuqair bin Shuqair, Mohamed al Badr, Majid al Asgar, Al Fugn, Faisal bin Shiblan are still in Kuwait territory, but show a tendency to want to cross into 'Iraq. NOTE. Th. writer suspects Uiat they fear a possible 'expulsion order' from the Shaikh of Kuwait given at the instance of Bin Baud and want to be handily situated near the ‘Iraq border, so as to move across if necessary. In the ordinary course of events the Mutair should in the course of the next 3 weeks or so move to the Tawal al .hafir7 SST) al Dhafir (’Iraq Neutral Zone) and gradually south from there back into their own country. This because of the rain that • has recently fallen in their own country, the 's tTmmft n*, (t) Rashaida.

(vi) Ajman ) ) Adwan ) No change since last report. ^ I Zab ) CMiMTS. (a) Large numbers of the above tribes, especially those owing allegiance to Bin Saud have, during the period under report, drawn supplies from Kuwait. This was to be expected. (b) With the advent of the southerly rains, Bin Baud’s tribes may be expected to slowly return ^ to their own country now, always provided bad news (a defeat for Bin Saud) does not in the mean time reach Kuwait. Should the latter happen, the Awazim, Mutair, Zab, Adwan aid other tribal elements from Nejd will, I think, stand fast and await events. (c) There is an absolute dearth of news frcxa Riath ani Nejd proper, which shows the King is maintaining an iron censorship. 8.M0HAM3D IBN TALLAL AL RASHID.. The well worn rumour is again current among the Bedouin that this individual has escaped fran Bin ^aud, and is now organizing a revolt in Jebel Shammar. The same individual, if one recollects aright, escaped on several occasions during the Ibn Rifada revolt. We may therefore discount the story as a fabrica tion, I think. 9.TRIBAL VISITORS.n - 8 - (i) 8.4.54. (ii) 8.4.34. (iii) 10.4.34. (iv) 13.4.34. (v) 13.4.34.

(See para iv of Summary for March) 10. MUSABILAH. This is now going on merrily as far as those Nejd tribes at present in Kuwait and ’Iraq are concerned. Parties may daily be seen, of all strengths, coming up to the to buy supplies. 11. HAMAD AL BAG-AAT I. (Bin Baud’s Blockade Officer). This notorious official known as the 'Butcher* appears to be able to do little in the way of controlling the tribes on the frontier today. He clearly has his eyes and ears turned towards Yemen. He was last reported as camped near Thamami. (News not corroborated). 12.SMUGGLING INTO NBJD. (i) Has definitely increased since the Yemen operations started, and this is obviously due to poorer control across the frontier. (ii) The writer has heard of at least 2 small caravans getting through to Buraida during the period under review, and was able to discuss routes taken etc. etc., with thewith the leader of a third caravan who was about to start via Dulai liyeh, Bishuk etc. POLITICAL AGifflTS TOURS IN DESERT. 15. (i) The writer proceeded to the Bnaiya, Has Jaliya regions on the southern boundary of Kuwait and on the borders of the neutral ^.one on 13th April and returned again on 15th April. He found grazing exceptionally good in the tfaluh region ^here the B&amp;ni Khalid under Ibn Ahasar were encamped alongside many Kuwait Araibdar. (3ii)The Bedouin met with, were everywhere nervous and anxiously awaiting news from the front. Everyone was going about heavily armed. (iii) I'on Khasar told the writer that he had no intention of returning to Qatif and to the heavy war taxes, for the present. He and his people had already been taxed out of existence at home and could stand no more. He despaired of what the future held, where his date gardens were concerned, (iv) The rains appear to have brought many snakes out of their hiding places. On 14th April the writer killed with his own hand 3 vipers and 2 cobras 4’ and 4*-6' long respectively. BIATH mm AND YAH IN YLMKN. 14. (i) As mentioned elsewhere little news is allowed to reach Riath apparently fran the Yemen front, and what reaches is carefully censored. (ii) on 12th April 1934, a wireless message from Mecca, addressed to the Shaikh of Kuwait through the Saudi Minister at Baghdad was received in Kuwait. .The contents were as follows 'The orders issued to the army of His Majesty the King to push forward across the frontier have already been given you. The first victory that ^od conferred upon. His troops was the occupation of Haradh by lamari ash-ohuway T ir, Commander of the Tihama area. Two forts however kept on resisting till finally one surrendered. The other which iswhich is occupied by ^.1 oabbani, Comroander of Imam Yahya’s farces in the Tihamn, Is still holding out. ews .iUs been received from His Highness the Wali f Ahd iuair baud to the efieot that the forces he pushed forward, under the leadership of iuaeer Faisal bin Sa f ad, through the mountains to Baqum, have capturea ’Aqabat-ash-Shatba - a most important post. They afterwards proceeded to and captured the village of 'Yabad' and the passage of 'Eab-ul-Hadid', which is the best naturally fortified pass through the mountains. Later the army advanced and besieged Baqum, most of the forts of which fell in their hands, and they the troops are now bombarding the last one which will shortly surrender, Inshallah. Baqum has always been the aim of our forces who transgressed our country at the mountains of Faifa and Bani Malik, ^meer Faisal captured the barracks there on the Ebnd Lhil Hujjah 1552(7.4.34). It is a 11 hours distant from Sa’dah for a foot man. In the meantime a force which had been sent by Imam Yahya under the leadership of a relative of his, one Saiyid ’Abdur Rahman bin Saiyid Abbas by name to Tihama for the relief of the fort of Haradh, was met by Hamad-ash-Shuway f ir who sent a detachment to meet it under the leadership of Ibn Abbud. Both forces met at 'Wadi Elran' between Midi and Luhaiya. Cur army routed and dispersed Imam Yahya’s force. The latter liien returned to Medi and laid siege on it. FOREIGN.' (iii)On 11th April the Shaikh received a telegram from the 'Moqattam 1 newspaper of Egypt, quoting a telegram frcm al Sanaa dated the 9th April. The contents were as follows: w San f a, the 9th April. The stay of the 'Adarisa' (Idrisis) in their homes in Asir, while a conference was being held there, was taken by King Ibn Saud as a suf ficient cause for declaring war against Imam ^ahya. He attacked Nejran and Haradh, where the Imam’s forces returned11 343) returned his attack with a conflagration of fire. A battle which took place in Najran resulted in the heavy defeat of the Wahhabis and in their retreat to a point beyond the frontier. The Idrisis contingents in the Tihama are also moving forward. Opinion here is much perturbed as to the fate of Saiyid Abdulla al Wazir (of the ftafd) because he is cut^ off A at Ab^a and no hews has been received frcm him since some days. The violent abuse which has appeared in the Henaz conimuaiques against the Imam Yahya has made the worst impression upon the minds of the Yamanites. The Yaman tribes are proceeding to the battle front, and the Yaman nation is eager to rescue the Hejaz from bondage'. (iv) A message from Aden to the Shaikh dated 9th April stated that the Yaman forces were moving to meet Bin Baud’s off ensiv e. (v) Another message from Aden to the shaikh dated llth April (received by Airways in Kuwait on 20th April) showed anxiety at the rapid progress of Bin Saud and his seizure of Harath. The latter was described as a most important spot whose loss endangered Medi and Saada. OIL ITTThSBESTS. 15. (i) The Oil negotiations which have since February 22nd of this year been proceeding smoothly between the Kuwait Oil Company and the Shaikh of Kuwait reached some what of a deadlock on 12th April. (ii) Apparently on 10th April the Kuwait Oil Company negotiators acting on instructions from their ^ondon principals asked the Shaikh to insert two new articles in what is known as the Commercial Agreement, and the Shaikh replied declining to do so. x (iii) Had the negotiators made it known that the insertic of the offending articles was by His Majesty’s Oovernment’s wish, matters mi$it not have taken the course they did. They did not do this, and out of annoyance and possibly alarm the Shaikh took the step he did. (iv) In the meantime the Kuwait Oil Company represent-representatives have referred the matter to London for further orders# (v; Accor ding to the Kuwait Oil Company 1 s negotiators there are grounds for supposing that another company (possibly the B.O.D.) has approached the Shaikh, or is about to approach him with an offer to negotiate an Oil concession. There may possibly therefore be some connection between such offer iif true) and the recent visit of the German Minister and French Charge * d r Affaires from Baghdad to Kuwait. (vi) For the present the writer prefers to think that the Shaikh was bluffing vdian he told the Kuwait Oil Company representatives (as he did) that he had had an offer from a 100 i&lt;&gt; British Compnay to bid against them.

My dear Dickson, Your o.D.O.C-7 of the 11th January to Calvert arrived here on February 4 by the steamer which took Calvert away on a well-deserved leave. He contemplates sene rather complicated trekking so it may be seme time before he sees your letter. I therefore acknowledge your kind offer of further assistance and I take the opportunity of saying how fully I share what Calvort said about the value of your monthly summaries to us here. One of my first tasks when I returned from leave was to road all those that I had not seen and I found them a mine of valuable information. We wrote to Bushire to express our thanks for your excellent answers to my questionnaire about trade # &amp;c. We have not yet got down to the economic survey we hadlr fr , planned but we hope to start on it seriously in the near future. Nothing of the sort has been dene since Ibn Saud roped the Hejaz into his dominions. At the moment the Saudi-Yemen situation continues to take up a great deal of our time. X should say that the chances of war or peace are now about fifty-fifty. The feature of the last month has been the tenseness of the situation in the mountain region northwest of Sa’a has done more to excite the Saudis than any other recent phase. The King continues to send troops to the South. Among the more or less recent departures from Taif has been that of Ibn Rubaiyan and his ’Ateyba. W * ** Lt.-Colonel H.R.P.Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, KUWAIT. # 23€4 - 2 - The difficulty all along has been to determine how far Ibn Saud lias been actuated by firmness or fear. He has certainly been too prudent to rush into a dangerous war but he may merely have been postponing it \mtil he is quite ready, Anyhow it really does look as though weware approaching the denouement: and yet when one remembers all that has happened between him and the Imam since 1926, one cannot even be sure of this. Yours sincerely, Sd, Andrew Ryan. -.. ——Notes. Register No. Minute Paper. p. Z. SECRET. // POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. Dated 193 . Ucc. Date. Initials. SUBJECT. To Under Secretary Secretary of State...

Before I do relinquish charge, however, I should like to let you know how greatly I have appreciated your very interest *4 ing and informative Intelligence summaries, in particular those sections relating to the tribes in Nejd, during the past summer. .4e here are only too conscious of our isolation und our remoteness from many of the important elements that go to make up the life of ^aadi Arabia. Our information on such matters for example as Oaudi relations with the Yemen comes largely from official souroes, directly or indirectly, and we have naturally to guard against a too uncritical acceptance of what we are told. To keep a proper perspective, to apply the necessary correctives, we have to rely, to a considerable extent, on observations posts such as Kuwait and Aden. It has been of great interest to look into Arabia, so to speak, from Kuwait month by month with your eyes and X am personally most grateful to you for your reports. I have tried to make my summaries, in the Jedda .Report, as full as possible in regsrd to the situation with the Yemen.

Shaikh ^hunalf is a member of the well known Sa'adun family of the Muntaflk, end resides with ihamlr Beg as Ss f adun near *?huyukh. He was a follower of Ajemi as 3 a f adun during the threat war, and lost his father and grandfather on the same day, at the battle of Turf iyeh( 1901) close to Buimida (Nejd), when shaikh ; ubarak al i^ubah of Kuwait and the present Bin ^&amp;ud were defeated by the Bin Baschid forces* 3« According to shaikh ^hunaif, he left Blath by camel on 25th October, after having spent 7 months as the King f s geest* Hla views on the general situation in central Arabia may be summarized as below and tend to confirm the many reports received In Kuwait, that things are not going too well with the King ( ft ) Greet discontent exists throughout Nejd againstagainst th, KU* and hi, Oovarmaant. ^ trlbas OTory*«r« ar* rebelUoua, and the townamn eapeclally Paopla of ^Idhand ^ala are dlaioy al to the Xp^e # &lt;• Hitherto fanatical Uchwan on whom the King used to rely, no longer exist as such. Their fanatlolam hna gone and they are definitely an exploded and broken force* The campaign towards Yemen is hltfily unpopular, and there are indications thet tha Imam Yahya ha a aucceaafully 'got at' some of Bin uaud's moat reliable tribea, notably the ntalba and Barb. It la openly whispered In Hlath that this la so. Gf the Hssu and ftlatti oontlngenta, which were sent soutti under Faisal ibn lu'ad al oaud, i»if deserted before they were two days out of the capital. The outstanding examples being the Awazlm, Kutalr am /»■ Harb. The first arrived at the capital some 600 strong, but only 150 marched south. The King is fully aware of his unpopularity, and does not dare leave his capital and lead hla Axtay hi self • Kor wiU he allow his son Scud to leave Kejd for the same reason. There Is no question at all of Bin Saul invading Y emn or Najran, on the contrary he is on the defensive already and straining every nerve to save Asir from the large, well equipped and organized army that the Imam Yahya la collecting, on the Aslr front. It Is even talked about in Kiath that Yahya’s objective Is Mecca Itself, but ♦Palace’ circles say that the ? ing will make peace and surrender Asir before anything so serious as that happens.- 3 - (404, U) (j) lh) should tba .audlan foroan in Aalr suffer the sllfittest reverse, then the Mejd army of fiedouln Irregulars will at once melt nay and without a doubt outbreaks will occur in various directions in Kajd, eoraraeneing with pa salve defiance of fax gatherers authority. uch anti- ngliah talk is tba fashion in the Capital, and from the King downwards, Ugland is made out to be eveiything that la tad and to be alowly working for the downfall of the uaudi dynastye Tba King htriaalf frequently discussed thla very question with halkh Jhunaif f and asked him cm more than one occasion, about f lraq and Hia Majesty’s ^cwemiaent *s present methods there.

Dated the 30th October 1933 # Prom Lt.-Colonel H.R,P.Dickson, C.I.E., I.A., Political Agent, Kwrait; To The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BU 3 HIRE « Kuwait Intelligence nummary for October 1933. Sir, In continuation of my confidential No.230, dated the 29th September 1933, I have the honour to forward my Intelligence Summary of Kuwait, Nejd and hinterland news for the month of October, together with 4 spare copies. I m. sending one copy of this each to Jedda and Bahrain direct. I. T R I B A L . (a) GENERAL. All Desert gossip continues to centre round Bin Baud's expedition to the Yemen, and no one even yet seems to know for certain whether Najran or the region round Jizan sabiya (Asir Coastal region) is the King*! ultimate objective. There seems little doubt that while a few of Bin Saud f s young troops are genuinely keen, being encouraged by the prospect of loot, the vast majority of his Tom and tribal levies (I do not include Bejaz troops) have no stomach at all fer operations in the distant south and have only been persuaded to march, through fear, and in some cases under definite compulsion. Matters are not helped by the knowledge of the great privations which last year's expedition experiencedand by the dread Asir disease which carried off f of ibn Mum f ad*• force, rior do the wonderful stories of the anna ments possessed by the Imam Yahya tend to encourage the northern Bedouin. •hat every one dreads above everything, according to my Bedouin informants, are the Yemen army*s 'chickens' (Baja J), which come 'running along the ground, bouncing and jumping and then explode when the, reach their objective'. These 'chi(deens' were, it is said, used with deadly effect on the Yam tribe of Nejran and the tales that are told of these infernal machines have caused widespread despondency and alarm. (C_&amp;3MiSNT. Obviously Tills Bombs, or something similar) # Already the news is filtering through to Kuwait of many secret desertions from the Army as it moved down the Wadi Duwasir. So great is the unpopular!ty of the King’s impending war that in the view of many experienced tribal leaders, Bin Baud will be very ill advised if he risks a pitched battle with the Yemen forces anywhere* The idea being that his army will melt away like chaff before wind, if fortune in any way goes against it* The Shaikh of Kiarat as well as the writer, for the above and other obvious reasons, more than ever, hold the view that the King, who must be given full credit of knowing what his people are thinking about, and how unpopular is his little war, has no intention of fighting, let alone invading Yemen; and that the whole business of mobilizing and sending a large force to Asir, is a manoeuvre pure and simple to make the Imam Yahya believe that the Kingdom of 'Saudiyeh' is in earnest and intends mischhf. At the last moment, no doubt, the King will ask the Imam Yahya to agree to some simple and very ea^r solution of the difficulties that exist. Honour/wmmsammm - 3 - Honour will b© declared to have been satisfied, and Bin ;&gt;aud will ^ive out to his people that he has forced Yemen to cone to terms and will march home a conqueror, Lo doubt there will be a certain amount of petty skirmishing, but not, it is believed, a big battle. The vJhaikh of Kwait’s appreciation of the situa tion given to the writer on 19th October 1933, is quoted below in as far as possible his own words. It is interesting and shows considerable shrewdness. (i) Yahya always was and is like a hedgehog (gunfith)« Tie can kill and eat such danger ous things as poisonous snakes and scorpions if he finds them alone, but if supported by a bigger animal or a”man', he will roll into a ball and act on the defensive, showing only a f, spiky ,f and awkward front: &gt; (ii) Bin iiaud on the other hand is like the s proverbial wolf(dhib). It will only attack sheep when results are certain, but if it sees that object of its greed is well defended (by good watchdogs) and ready to attack back, he will snarl, make a great fuss, and pretend to be ready to fight, but will mo»t assuredly give ground and eventually bolt always pro vided the dogs are bold and rush in* (iii) Bin Gaud for the moment far from wanting to fight Yemen, fears an invasion of Asir, he will definitely try and defend that country if he feels he can successfully do so, but if he feels he cannot, he will make peace at once, and on any terms* (iv) No general war with Yemen will take place* Peace talks are already going on be hind the scenes for both wolf and hedgehog4 - hedgehog knew how to play the game of 'Huff' to perfection, (b) AjmK ) 1 MUTAIR )^ l AITAZIM ) Tribes, I ' HARB ) ATTAI3A ) Nothing to report, but sea notes under para II 'Riath and War humours'. (c) DHAFIR, J~a 6 a t an as Kuwait is reported to have returned from Riath (24,10,^3,) but this has yet to be confirmed, (See para I(k) of last Summary for September), (in 25th October the rather disquieting news reached the writer from a personal friend and reliable person just back from Riath that Bin Saud in dismissing Jada^n allotted him the task of assisting his frontier officials in the Blockade of Kuwait by preventing persons going in or out of the Town, Jada’an was once gt'/en this secret task before in 1931, and steps were thm taken to get the ’Iraq Government to recall him together with his followers to ’Iraq, At present Jada’an is camped in Kuwait territory, 30 miles south of the Town at Tawil wells, but will shortly move into the 'Gara’a” region (Saudi territory) west of the Shaqq depression. Sven then lie will probably continue to send his camels to Tawil and subaihiyeh to drink. Both the Shaikh of Kuwait and the writer are watching this sportsman’s activities carefully, E1KT0SH A3 SUWAIT was recently wrongly reported by the writer to have moved north into ’Iraq l^ee para I(k) of Summary for September). It ^appears that he moved south instead and camped in the unfrequented region known as ALBAHRA on the north side of the Bay of i uwait. He re mained there till about 20th October more or less hiddenhidden^ 8 inoe when he has been gradually edging west to the Kraa al Maru ridge west of the Jahara - Safwan - Pasra road where grazing is reported good. With him are the Bani Hussain section of the Dhafir who throughout the summer were camped at Safwan (’Iraq) and who have made themselves rather notorious over their 'smuggling' activities lately. (d) AKNAZg, During October a few small parties both from the Amarat and ahamsha visited Kuwait and bought up supplies f tfiieh they said they were going to take to Syria - a rather tall story in the opinion of the writer. (e) RAINS* With the advent of the rainy season, tribal concentrations awe on wells are everyidiere breaking up and tribes are generally moving off to winter grazing grounds. TT.RIATH KEWS AND WAR HUMOURS. 1. During October news from Riath has come in more regularly, and with greater frequency than before, and in spite at the King's veiy strict censorship the veil may be said to have largely lifted from happenings at the Capl tal. 2* On 10th October a Ford car belonging to the King arrived at Kuwait from Riath, Hie driver having in structions to convey some ladies Iwho had cane from Xubair) beck to Riath. The dritfer who is well knowi in the own brought the following information, which has since been smply confirmed from several other sources: ^a) The final concentration of Bin Jaloui’s force and the Riath force took place early in October, and the combined army proceeded south in suc cessive echelons via the DawasirDawaslr vaUey, from the 5th October to th« 7th Of October, (b) Ihe total strength of the concentra— tlon was some 9,000 fleeting men, (4,000 from Hassa ana 5,000 from the 1 ieth district), (c) The combined force which moved from i&amp;tn was under the nominal command of f*aisal bin oa’ad, the '.ing f s nephew, a not particularly striking youngman of about 21 years of age - known to the writer. (d) The King’s orders to Faisal bin Sa’ad were that he should proceed to Bisha and itaniya at the southern end of the wadi Dawasir, where he would meet the King’s second son Faisal, Viceroy of the ilejaz, who would take over the supreme command from him, (e) Up to the time when the /jrmy moved off no one knew whether from Blsha the destination of the force would be Najran via Tathlith etCy or /bha, (f) The Riath force before it m&amp;rched suffered greatly from sickness due, it was said, to dirt and lack of the most elementary sanitary precautions on the part of the King’s Government, The various large Bedouin contingents, which had arrived daily throughout the month of September, and had greatly congested the already overcrowded capital, had obviously contaminated the water supply, with the result reported, COMMENT, J- 7 - A- « 'X ? -- COLli.lJ-lT » i^rom the symptoms reported l*e. a 21 day-sickness, the probabilities are that the outbreak was of an enteric nature. (g) Many secret desertions took place before the force moved off. (h) The Imam Yahya was reported to have written to the King in September and beg ged him not to go to war in which many Muslims would unnecessarily perish. He, the Imam, was ready to fall in with all tin King’s wishes, but his difficulty lay in the fact that his son Saif ul Islam -ahmad had got out of hand. Bin Baud replied in similar vein that he too was averse to war, but that he had four hot-headed sons none of whom could he control. These were marching on Yemen against his (Bin Baud’s) will. (3) The following news was aipplied by the shaikh of Kuwait on 19th October: (a) On the 18th October an Ajman tribesman in Kuwait service arrived from Riath confirming the motor drivers report in detail. (b) The man also brou^it the news that it was pretty certain that the now famous Riath prisoners Naif bin Hithlain Ibn Lamifr and Ibn lumaid . had been murdered by Bin Baud’s orders. They had apparently been sent in 3 lorries osten sibly to Hoffuf, in response to the long made demand of Ibn Jaloui, that the prisoners should be dealt wi th by him. The lorries had, it seems, never reached Hoffuf, but returnee empty to Riath the next day. It was everywhere in Riath whispered that the prisoners had been shot and buried in the Dahana sands by a party sent by Ibn Jaloui to take them over. In this connection see para Y.b.(ix) and V.c.(i) of4(5' J - 8 - of this office ^um ;aiy for August 1933 # COM: The stoi*y of the murder of these unfortunate wretches haa readied ivuws.it from so many sources during September aim October that I cannot but come to the regret ful conclusion that the incident is true. The Ajman and Mutair tribes hoping against hope that Ibn Hathlain and Ibn their chieftains were still alive, have refused so far to believe that Ibn Saud would lend himself to such a dastardly deed, but even they have resigned themselves to what they believe to be the truth at last* It is said that no one but members of Bin v&gt;aud f s slave bodyguard accompanied the prisoners when they set out in the lorries, and that even the lorry drivers were slaves. Hence there were no Arab eye witnesses of the deed, for slaves donot ever talk. Three things however are certain and have been amply corroborated by Ajman and Mutair tribal report: (a) The prisoners actually set out for ^— Hoffuf ana were seen. (b) The old Ajman woman who cooked the prisoners* food and sent it to their prison daily, was told she need no longer cook their food as the prisoners had left the previous day for TIassa. (c) The prisoners never reached Hoffuf. Ibn J&amp;loui had many times and publicly vowed that he would take the life of hail' ibn Hathlain for the pert he took in the killing of his son iTahad bin Jaloui in 1929 as well as execute Ibn Lami and Ibn Humaid if they ever fell into his hands. Tha Kings leniency where these men were concerned had for long caused a ' coolness ,, between the Governor of Hassa and his Master.( 0 ) In view of the King’s written assurance to His Majesty’s Government, glv^i through the late Sir Hu# Biscoe at Khabari iVadtha after the Akhwai rebellion of 1929/30 that Ibn Hathlain and Ibn Lami would not be put to death, but with &lt;’aisal al Duwish would only be Jeept in prison for a reasonable period, if they were handed over by His Majesty’s Government, it is hoped that Jedda will cause careful and exhaustive enquiries to be made into the truth of the above story. The incident is of the hi^iest importance in Bedouin eyes fdr all know of the promise given by the -ing to His Majesty’s Government, and England will be accused of a greivous breach of faith if these men have indeed been ’put away’. 4. The following news was supplied by the ohaikh of Kuwait to the writer on 25th October: (a) The report was widely current in Hiath aixl Kuwait that His Majesty’s Government was financing Bin Baud for his cctaing war with Yemen and had given him two loans. Note. The Bhaikh enquired if I had heard anything to this effect. (b) Bin Jaloui had executed 2 Mutair tribesmen(Jiblan) 2 Mutair ditto (Braih): 1 Kejdi townsman; for having be® caught with merchandise on their persons whilst crossing from Kuwait into JNejd. (c) He, the Shaikh, had received a letter from one of his subjects in Aden (by Air Mail from Karachi), dated 12th October to the effect that lejran had been evacuated by the Imam Yahya except for 3 strong forts (which had been erected) , and all Yemen troops had proceeded to the Sabiya front# (d) Al Shuwaish hitherto one of Bin Baud’s most popular and trusty friends and counsellors, and for long10 - entrusted with, the royal camel herds, was suddenly arrested in Hlath about 19th ^otober and thrown into prison. All his tents, property etc. etc., had been confiscated and his womenfolk brought to Alath by a certain AX Kibai another of the King's most trusty henchmen. he above news has caused much concern among the Mutair (Jiblan boction) , among whom Al bhuwaish was an out standing and respected figure. No charge has, as far as one can make out, been preferred against the man. Nothiag of inportance to report under this head except the savege beheading by Ibn Jaloui’s orders of the 5 111611 oaught snuggling (See the immediately preceding para (b) # ) (b) Referenda para TII(b) of September Summary, Letters have reached the sons (in Kuwait) of the one of the Aneiza merchants recently arrested by the King for trading with Kuwait to the effect that before their father 1 s release the King held a Durbar of tribesmen and Townsmen in Riath and swore publicly that if he caught anyone of his subjects trading with or being in possession of goods emanating from Kuwait, he would not only confis cate his camels and the goods but would have the man exe cuted on the spot. He, the King, had called upon God, all those present, and all who could not be present, t bear witness that he had given this solemn warning so that no one should have cause to complain afterwards, if he slew regardless of mercy. The King added that he had already sent orders to his frontier officials near Kuwait to carry out these instructions to the letter. The sons were warned by their father to be extra careful- u - XT’. G B N a R A r. (a) On 13th October one aaeed bln Abdulla Aairl arrived from Transjordan ostensibly to buy''Abbahs'. He left arain on 15th October* (b) On 24th Khan Sahib shaikh Farhan al Hahma of Basra, a personal friend of the writer and one well known to the -oyal Air orce Intelligence Department, returned from Riath via Bahrain (by up alow mail). He bad repaired there laat Au©ist. He sent a letter ashore describing his Journey and confirming all lath news as given above, including the mur der of the unfortunate Tf Riath prisoners”, Bhaikh Farhan mentioned that he had met Mr*Twitcbell of the Standard Oil wo.. Ltd. and that the latter had seemed most enthusiastic regarding Oil all over the Hassa Province* f V* OIL. V v*o«Jhaikh arhan (mentioned in the previous para, ’b 1 ) informed the writer that Riath gossip had it that Bin Laud had insisted that the Bhaikh of Qatar went to Riath in connection with Oil and that Bin Baud had insisted that he, the Bhaikh, should break with the A.P*O.C., and give the final Qatar Concession to the Btandard Oil. (k) In a subsequent conversation on the same subject which the writer had with the Bhaikh of Kuwait on 26th October 1933, the latter gave for what it was worth, the f /, following piece of Riath alace gossip, ihich had reached Kuwait by tinistworthy^^ 2 ^^^ ' (i) The man who had got the Bhaikh of Kuwait to go to Riath, had been Mohomed al Mana (a very pro Bin Baud individual) acting under King* s the/instructions, (ii) At a secret interview with the King the latter had asked his guest what he meant by giving/ 4/a12 - giving tin exploitation concecsicn to the COMMENT A.i.C.C. Did he wish qntar to become like rahrein, a complete dependency of the English? If so he was going the ri^it way about it. if he gave the A.I.C.C. the final Oil Conces sion, had he asked himself, what would happen? The liiglish YTOuld assuredly expect safety and protection for the Company’s engineers etc., from him, the Jhaikh of c^atar, and fail ing ef Tective protection, they would as assured -ly land troops or bring aeroplanes to do it tor him. If the Jhaikh was unreasonable he, Bin i and, would certainly see that this came about, inspite of anything that he, the bhaikh, could say; for iiejd tribesmen had an awkward way of getting out of hand and attack ing whore they were least expected to attack* ( The first to be hurt would be tho A. P.O.C* refineries (at his instigation of course). The Dnglisb would then be forced to act and take over ^atar, or at least the protection of the a. P.O.C. community. If on the ether band lie,the bhaikh, was sensible ond gave the concession to the King’s proteges, the Standard Oil Co., of America, why, then everything would be 'couleur de rose’’ for hiia, and the British would get no chance at all of getting a footing in his State as all Hejd Bedouins would know how to behave themselves. Ko doubt the Political .-^gent, Bahrain, has also COMMENT heard the above story, and can say what the true facts are. The tele however rings true, for his threat of Kejd Bedouins13 - Bedouins getting out of hand* is a favourite dodge of the King, when judicious pressure is required to be brought to bear on a person who does not quite see eye to eye with him• It has been tried against Kuwait before now, and indeed may again be attempted before long. A reliable Bedouin, who looks after the writer’s camp arrangements in Kuwait, and who was in Rieth during the Shaikh of star’s whole visit there, reported that the first story that went around was that the Shaikh of Qatar’s country had been seized by the British and the Shaikh and party had come to appeal to Bin baud for help. Later this was denied and it was said the visit was purely a friendly one. Before he returned home, Shaikh Abdulla ibn Ihani was given a present of 5 new Ford motor cars by the King, and 4 mares and 1 stallion by Ibn Jaloui. VI. PIRIIO 01. KU ,aIT 1110,V 3Y ’IRAr •fiit On the night of 12th October, a small dhow, crew of five, owned in Kuwait, by tyo domiciled ersian^, subject^ of the Shaikh, was returning empty from Bandar BIIAM, a port in Per: ia, tfien it was attacked by an armed Customs launch belonging to the Fao (’Iraq) Customs service. The Officer in charge of the launch apparently hailed the dhow in the early morning (1 o’ Clock ^jrabic), and ordered it to heave to. As the crew did not hear the hail, they did nothing, 'hereupon the launch opened a sharp fire on the dhow, killing the hakhuda and wounding two of her crew. The Customs officer one Hussain Bffendi then boarded the dhow, but found no cargo on board. Fe next proceeded to take the dhow in tow and conveyed her to Pao, where the Police apparently took the case in hand. The incident is said to have taken place close to Has Bubiyan, (i.e. near the old Turkish Fort, which is situated on the Island ofIsland of that name) and the airvivors protested to the Police that had been shot up outside ’Iraq waters, and generally brutally treated In the manner described, inspite of the fact that their craft was entirely empty and they were in nocently returning to Kuwait from a voyage to Persia. The : olice, who from various accounts received in Kiarait f took the part of the dhow, asked Hussain Effendi to show them the exact spot where the incident took place. This Hussain Effendi made out to be West of the Fao peninsula opposite the date gardens known as a! Duwasir, althou^i the two survivors very strongly protested that this was not so. At the Shaikh’s request a telegraphic protest was at once made to the Ron’ble the Political Resident at Bushire for onward transmission to the ’Iraq Government, and a full repot't is being made of the incident which from the Kuwait point of view is a serious ona. This is the second occasion when a Kuwait dhow has boon 'shot up' with loss in killed and wounded because the Pakhuda did not heave towhen told \ to do so on the high seas. VTI. AGRARIAN TROUBLES IN SHAIKH OF ]rj;,-a¥‘o Fa'6 : uo. iK*. The serious agrarian troubles which broke out in the ohaikh of Kuwait’s Fao Estate on the Ghatt al Arab early in the Jumraer, and which lasted throughout July, August and September were brought to a successful conclusion on ing 8 th October, The end coincided with the departure of the Mutasarrif of Basra to another part of ’Iraq, The origin of the trouble was shrouded in mystery, and outwardly shov/ed itself in the form of an appeal to the Mutasarrif, Basra by certain fellahs for protection against the nhaikh, who was made out to have usurped the property from themselves, the real owners of the soil. The Mutasarrif from the first took the side of the fellaheen, and nearly succeeded in bringingbringing about a most ugly and serious situation, fortunately the Shaikh ably supported by his Basra lawyer and Agent, successfully countered the yarious moves of the fellaheen and the Mutasarrif and by tactful and diplo matic methods, terminated the dispute in the satisfactory manner recorded. The shaikh suggests that the whole incident was an attack against himself and was inspired frcm Baghdad, but it ie d.i ficult to prove this. The curious part of the business is that the property has been in the shaikh’s family for close on 100 years, and never before have the tenants given the slightest trouble, or ever expressed dis satisfaction against their landlord. Vm. ASOYKIAN TROUBLES. A prominent Basra notable (name need not be divulged) visited Kuwait early in the month and in con versation with the Lhaikh gave the following appreciation of the Assyrian trouble. This is given below, with due apologies, as an interesting example of how certain politl cally minded Basrawis, viewed that unfortunate business. (a) Had not the Assyrian trouble eventuated, there was to have been a .ihiah tribal rising on the ^uph^rates. (b) The Assyrian situation gave the ’Iraq Government a heaven sent chance of taming the peoples minds in the direction of an anti- English and anti- Christian campaign, with the result that (a) above did not come off. (o) The Turkish Minister in Bagxdad had a large hand in the Assyrian business and advised the Government to adopt the strong measures they did which followed good Turkish precedent, nlxplanations could always be given later in order to put ’Iraq right with His Majesty’s Government and the League of Nations. (d) The Army however went too far, and Govern-- 16 - and Government realized too late that 5 n«land had been deeply roused as well «« Leajpe of Katlons. Orde^went forth to all officials to go out of their way to please the Cnglii*, so as to get them on their side at Geneva. (e) strong efforts were at the same time made to prevent an independent enquiry by the League of Nations, ingland had at all costs to be dragged in - a not difficult task, as it was believed that she would have to see ’Iraq through her difficulty, owing to the fact that she herself had sponsored her independence. (f) As soon as League of Nations enquiry was over, in the opinion of the informant, there would be another heavy anti-English attach throughout country agsdfnst .n^^nd, all inspired from 3a#idad. lg) tho informant further gave it aa his opinion that His Majesty's Government would do y/ell to allow an independent enquiry, even though it meant blame for herself, as only thus would .tagland regain the confidence of other minorities in ’Iraq, both Jew and Christian. me ohaikh repeated to the writer the above story, though he was careful to say they were not necessarily his own views.

Sir, In continuation of my Confidential ' O# 203, dated the ^ 6 th August 1933, i have the honour to forward my intelli gence Summary of Kuwait, ^ejd and Hinterland news for the month of September together with 2 spare copies. 1 am sending one copy of this to Jedda and Bahrain direct. ^ 1. TRIBAL . (a) During September the whole Bedouin world of .North East Arabia has talked of nothing else but Bin Saud f s great concentrations near Hoffuf and Riath for his coming war. (b; The King would appear to have purposely left his great tribes 'guessing' as to his real intentions and ultimat objective, for even now no one really can say where he intends to attack, though the most commonly accepted story is that it willbe Rejran, if indeed he takes up the imam fahy&amp;'s challenge at all, as many doubt. (c) Certain it is that the great tribes who have no stomach at all for operations to the distant south and - have/have been making every effort to get out of supplying contingents as they were ordered to do .have during September an., after many meetings come to the conclusion that it were better to obey the King’s and Ibn Jalaoui's orders than to lianp bae.: and risk the King's displeasure and punishment. (d) '’heir line of argument has been typical and curious c,o follow and has taken the following line!- ^Either (1 ) the King intended to fall upon and punish some big tribe like Ataiba which had not been too loyal during the last year, or (ii) he desired to make a test mobilization of his forces to find out who were really loyal among subjects, or (iiij he planned to go to the assistance of be j ran which had been overrun by the imam Xahya’s am i e s ”. ■They saw money and loot in [i) and Ui; and disaster in Uii^ It were setter, however, to risk disaster than the King’s anger, for his arm was long and he never forgot. So con tingents must he sent. (ej In other words a mixture of curiosity, cupidity and fear decided them to obey the call to 'ghazzi ” and send their contingents, to the places of concentration decided upon. (f) These have been fixed as follows (a) A1 Juda and Nejbiyeh 145 miles b.Wi w. of Hofufj for the Hassa tribes including Mutair Uiwa and Wasil). (b) Hiath and Khar.i district (30 miles S.E. of Hiathj for the passim, Arid Washam town con tingents, as well as the tribal groups of Harb, Sbei, Sahool Mutair (Bani Abdilla) and others. (gJ The 11th September (al Hus; was, as far as one can gather, fixed upon as the date when all contingents shouldbe ready concentrated at the above two rendezvous. The 26th September (New MoonJ was given out by the King as the date on which his armies would inarch. (h) The following Hass a tribes have definitely been ascertained to have sent contingents to A1 Juda and Nejbiyeh in spite of having, throughout August, tried their utmost to get out of doing so, on one excuse or another, in every case almost, contingents were not up to the strength demanded. 1. Aw a z i. m. 2. Ajman. 3. Mutair (llwa and Xxj&amp;l Wasil). 4• Ban! Khalid. 5. Bani Hajir. 6 . Manasir. 7. Murra. (i) Of the above the Awazi m and Mutair were those who tried hardest and longest to avoid obeying the King's orders. (j) In every case non-combatants, etc. have remained camped on the various wells where they have been throughout the summer except the Awazim who show a tendency to close up to and concentrate in the Kuwait neutral Zone. (k) DHAHIR . In paragraph 1 of Kuwait Summary no*203 of 26th August, 1 mentioned that Ajemi as-Suwait was reported to have gone to Riath to see the King, and that Jadaan as- Suwait after being w zakied'returned from Maragha and camped at Subaihiyeh. Actually (a) Ajerni as-Suwait left for Riath on 19th t September and is still there. (b) Jadaan as-Suwait left for Riath on 4th September with his nephew Mirwi al Suwait and was seen there as late as 15th Septem ber. Before/I - -4- Befoi*e he left Jadaan moved his camp [1/2 dozen tents only}' to Tawil and joined up vfith Ajemi’s people, HANTUSH AS-*3UWAIT . was reported on the 16th September to have moved J^orth West into ’Iraq from Dm fliga (Kuwait territory! because of the contraband activities of some of his people, which he feared would get him into trouble with the ’Iraq authorities, (l) ATAI3A . This great tribe appears definitely to have been excused from furnishing any war contingent probably because Bin Sauld felt it would be unwise to try and compel it to do so, Ibn Babaiyan, their leader, after holding out for a considerable period against the King’s order to go to Riath and see him, eventually was persuaded to repair to the capital through the agency of certain friendly Shaikhs. He took care to send 11 mares ahead of him to appease the wrath of the King as well as three ladies of his family to act as spokesmen for him. The King to his surprise, no doubt, received him well, loaded him with presents and informed him that both he and his Ataiba, as well as others v/ho had taken part in the Asir operations last year need not provide any war contingents for his coming campaign. See paragraph V (d) iv of Summary dor August, (m) EARS. Al Firm, the paramount Shaikh of this tribe, after having assisted in bringing the sulking ibn Rabaiyan of the Ataiba to his senses and persuading him to go to Riath, when he appeared likely to refuse to do so, himself started giving trouble. He pleaded by letter, that it was necessary to guard the northern marches of Saudiyeh for the King, and that he was too old a man to be asked to go and fi ght/fight Mejran or Asir nay. The King was firm and replied that hi 3 day of need had come, when every loyal man must stand hy him. He insisted on his sending the necessary war contingent, seeing that his trihe had not gone to Asir in 1932. As regards guarding his northern frontier, the King explained that Ibn Husaad of Hail was quite capable of doing this and had been alloted the task. The tribe had complied with the King 1 s call. n. hiath hbws and war humours . (a) 'these have been so many and frequent throughout September, that 1 have decided to give a summary of the news as given me by the more reliable of my informants, rather than attempt, in any way to sift the immense volume of rumour and gossip, that has come in almost daily from Hiath, Q^assim and hedouin sources. (bj The following was supplied by His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait on 6 th September 1933: (U Kuwait bazaar rumour had it that ±tin Saud had ordered 50,000 bags of rice from India to go direct to Has Tanura near Qatif, and tenders were already being asked for from dhow owners for the transportation of this consignment from ^as Tanura to Ojair. Rs.25/- per 100 bags had already been offered. Cpamentj^. ho doubt the -Political Agent, Bahrain, is in possession of the correct facts. (ii; He confirmed the news that the export of dates from TT assa had been forbidden by the King. (ill) The 2000 men sent by ibn Saud dowi the w a di Dawasir in August which he (the Shaikh; had said, had been recalled, had merely been order ed to hold fast, they had not been^ withdrawn. (See para V(d; (iiij of my August Summary). (c) The following news was supplied on 10 th September a minor Shaikh of the Mahfuth section of the Ajman, who resides in Kuwait territory. He had left Riath on 24th August.-6- (i) The Hass a tribes were concentrating their fighting forces in the A1 Juda area at Najbiyeh under the direction of ibn Jaloui. Both places were north west of Hoffuf and water and grazing were plentiful* (iij The force so collected was to he under the comniand of Baud, ibn Jaloui’s son, (iiiJThe place for the concentration had been selected for its proximity to Hoffuf, whence dates, rice and supplies generally could be easily transported to them. (iv)Riath gossip was that Hejran was to be the King’s objective. (v) He had heard the King in open Mejliss say that Yemen forces had overrun the whole of Hejran and were in complete occupation of the valley. (vi ) Several Hejran Shaikhs load arrived at Bin Saud’s court, notably ibn Mana, to beg for help against the imam Yahya. (vii) He had heard in Riath that ibn Rabaiyan (Ataibai, A1 Firm (Harbj and Mashari ibn Musaiyis (Mutairj were all trying to get out of sending war sort ingents to the capital, and that the King was anxious lest these Chiefs should suddenly defy him, and make his task of mobilization difficult. Iviii) He had returned from Riath via Hoffuf and the coast, and saw contingents of Ajman Bani Hajir, and Awazim everywhere moving south to A 1 Juda. (ixJ He noticed that Awazim non-combatants with women and children were moving into the Kuwait Heutral Zone. These, he thought, were planning to come up to Kuwait for supplies, taking advantage of the partial disorganisation that had occurred in the Blockade arrangements as a result of war rumours. (dj The following was given joy me by a reliable Shaikh of the Jiblan section of the Mutair on 15th September: u; (iii Faisal bin Aun of Medina had sent to Riath 20 herds (Assasj of 30 camels each. Faisal) bin Sulaiman of Yaif had sent to Riath 15 Assas of 50 camels each. (iiij He confirmed story that ibn Rabaiyan had arrived at Riath with eleven mares and two ladies, and that the King had forgiven him publicly for having refused to attend when first summoned and had further excused Ataiba from sending a war contingent. (ivj A1 Firm, Shaikh of Harb had written in to say that he was prepared to go and fig£it-7- flght towards the north, east or west, hut could not go south as he was no longer a young man, hut that the King had refused to excuse him. (vj Ihn Masaad, Governor of Hail, had been informed hy the King that Hail and Shammar need not supoly any contingents. Their role was ! to watch the nottti and west, (vi ) n, he Mut a i r l Llwa ) Chief s , Ihn Shuqair and ihn Maziad, had been to Hiath early in September to excuse themselves for their inability to bring men, but without success. (e) The following was brou^it me by a reliable Kuwaiti of Hutair origin. He reached Kuwait on 24th September from Hiath after visiting Buraida, Anaiza, Zilfi, najraaa, Artawiyeh. (a) All towns of Qassim including all 'hayars” i.e.knu Akhwan settlements, had sent their contingents to Hiath. (b) All persons who had gone on ’’^hazztk” to Asir last year were by Hoyal decree excused this year. (c) Among those excused were ibn Musaad, Governor of Hail, ibn Habaiyan and whole of Ataiba, and Mashari ibn Musaiyis, Shaikh of Artawiyeh. (d) A1 Mutair lHwa and Wasili' including the follow ing well-known Shaikhs: ibn Shuqair, al Fuqum, Ibn Lanir, ibn Shiblan, ibn Jarbuh, ibn Shuwairi- bat and Ibn Ashwan, had after much wavering moved to Al Juda with their respective flighting men. lej Al Harb had also marched in spite of many lamentations on the part of their Chief, Al Hirra. (fj The Al Juda force was under orders of ibn Jaloui's son, while the Hiath concentration was under orders of Saud bin Abdul Aziz. (gj The King had intimated that he would himself take supreme command. •fh) The King's objective was definitely now JNejran, not Asir, and the route would be via Solaiyil Gam, Bisha and r, athlith. (i) The Imam *ahya had sent a formal declaration of war 'Bad al Niga' to Bin Sahd saying,'Beware, my son, Saif al Islam is proceeding to invade your country'. Bin Saud is said to have replied with the laconic message,”He is welcome, i have also a son, who will meet him, and give him his deserts'. a)/(f) (i) On 27th September Hig Excellenc}' the Shaikh of Kuwait informed me that one of his trusty Ajaian messengers had just returned from RiatM25.9.33;. He had actually dined with ibn Mana, Shaikh of the Hejran tribes (Yarn), who was a refugee with Bin Saud. ibn Mana had told him that he had recently sent back to nejran 4 of his men by the King’s orders to bring news of the strength of the Yemen forces. That they had been captured and irad to confess their errand: upon which Saif al islara had ordered them to be taken round and shown everything possible, and then Me sent back to Bin Saud to tell the latter what they had seen. (iij The same informant brought the report that the King had given out that he would himself shortly motor down to Al - T uda and inspect the force concentrated there. (iiij The Shaikh opined that Bin Saud would not go f to war even yet, as such would be too dangerous for him. All the talk of war, etc.etc. was so much bluff he thought, and the King would leave himself a loophole as a 'face saver”. Comment. i am inclined to agree with this view. 111. BLOCKADE. [a) nothing of importance to report under this head, lb) Apparently as a result of the caraven incident near Hafar al Batin hk of 14th July, where Al Sharaafi al Dausiri, Bin Saud T s official was killed by blockade runners, (see para il of my Summary for July last, no.l82j dated 10th August), news reached the King early in Septem ber that 16 small convoys had got through to Anaiza, from Kuwait. He accordingly sent an armed party from Riath to demand of Ibn Sulain, the headman of Anaiza, the actual16 caravans, ‘i'he story was of course denied whereupon the King ordered the arrest of 16 leading citizens, who were later made to pay a fine of Rials 200 each, xhe story has not been confirmed, so it must be taken for what it is worth, IV, OIL. (a) On one or two occasions lately His Excellency when discussing the Hassa Oil Concession recently given to the Standard Oil Company, has been strangely definite in his assertion that the King had not included the Kuwait Neutral Zone in the concession, (b) In referring to the Shaikh of Qatar's visit to Riath on 25th August, the Shaikh gave it as his opinion that the Shaikh of Qatar, who was under the thumb of bin Saud, might easily be persuaded to try and cancel his agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, at the behest of the King, He further gave it as his opinion that actually the journey to Riath was not connected with oil, but with the loan of £ 10,000, which the Shaikh of Qatar had made to Bin Saud some time back. He had heard that the Shaikh of (Qatar had stupidly reminded the King about repayment and this had greatly angered that monarch. Abdulla ibn Jaloui, his friend, had then secretly instructed the Shaikh of Qatar to come and make his peace, promising himself to act as gorbetween. Comment . No doubt the Political Agent, Bahrain, has full details of the matter. V # BASIDU INCIDENT AND VISIT OR BRITISH DESTROYER TO^lLLA TO THE .PERSI A N GULff .

Apparently the / lag's Blockade Officer al ■aganwi and the King hlmaelf thought likewise , as saiy be seen man the following sequel to the Incident. Ibn Jaloul on hearing the news of the contra band affair aM the resulting engagement, at once sent a party of 36 men under Ulalylh al &amp;ttaibl to i alnforee 1 'agaawi's &gt;lockade Contingent, with orders that Al Bag&amp;awl should punish the itraih without delay. Al Bagaawl refused to carry out the orders, on the plea that the Bralh were excited and In a bad mood and any undue pressure would send than hot foot over the frontier Into Imq. Vssraud al /Saganwi wrote to Ibn Caloui and explained his reasons for not taking action anf? put the matter clearly before him. Bln Jaloul agraed t-sat ho AX ft.gauwl need not acoonpany the punitive expe dition but ordered that ulalylh the ittaibl should act alone. The latter accordingly moved to iiafar, but before reaching that place, he received peremptory orders from Al ohuwalsh the )lag’s Official In charge of the Royal Cornel Herds at Kafar al Ate to hold his handj this was followed teaedlately by a letter from Bln Baud himself ordering no action , as Ibn Ashwan, All al ..auwalribet and Ibn arbuh, the Bralh leading hail ho, v,ore In hlath and had explained everything aatisfacterlly. Cc«a»nt . from the above it Is clear that the King thought the time inopportune for punishing the Braih, as this would upset the {ataix generally, Just when he was about to launch e campaign In the South.

Tiie unwisdom of this move with unrest in Nojd and every where on the increase, ought to have been patent to a child t hut the King apparently is determined to take the advice of hi© amateur financial anc custom© advisor©, am oh as Abdullah bin Sulalman and 1 ohoned al Tawii, etc. Aie worst feature of these now customs duties is that it taxes out of all reason the peoples food and necessities of lifw. For Ins tan sc duty on sugar is now 119', on rioe 40;^ and on matches which is as important as actual food to the Najdi and Eedouin, £00%« The iruTtediate result of these ferocious duties has been to greatly increase the already deep hatred and resentment v/hich certainly all ovor Hajd and Hassa anc North iast urabia is felt for Bin Saud, and which will certainly be taken advantage of by his Northern neighbours• The Bedouin everywhere and openly pray for the day when the King will either die, or will smash birr self against Yemen or /sir. Fin oaud does not appear to raaliae that his people who grew nothing njtd produce nothing (I refer in particular to the Bedouin tribes) are starvings They will not be able to stand tha sire in ia' oh longer, fhey muet either revolt on a large scale or ©tart fighting each athcr to ^et food. Bin Raid’s srubfiidies which hitherto have kept the tribes quiot, have either been stopped c.r boon greatly reduced. The seconda ry resultof the new duties has been to aiva 4 w wo givo great Impetus to the contraband trade into Najd from Kua.it. The same I underatand applies in the case of Bahrain also. In spite of the actirities of Ibn Jaloul's frontier patrols, erer increasing numbers of Najd tribes men. are secretly finding their way into Kuwait, with the deliberate intention of trying to run rioe, sugar, tea and other foodstuff, into the interior. They are' desperate men. drIren on by the haunting knowledge that thair families are on the rerge of starvation. These blockade breaker, tell me (I often hare talks with them), that if they lose four contraband cargoes, either through capture, or destruction by their own hand, and get away with a fifth caravan, it will .till pay them, such are the high prioea that rule in Bin Sand* a dominions. The following incident which occurred on the 14th July is an example of the desperation to which the Bedouins are being driven, and X fear we have not heard the end of the incident, for Bin aaud^ ana is still long, and he sesms to delight in revenging himself on his poor subjsots these days. Two small caravans numbering 22 and 21 camels respectively, consisting of Braih tribesmen (Mutair) whose main camp is at Hafhr al Batin, left Kuwait on the 11th July. By prearrangement they travelled separately their plan being to meet somewhere in the Dahana and then make for Oaslm, after getting through the Blockade ring. The first party reached &amp;haib al ?ao 20 miles south west of Haffcr when were pursued and challenged by one of Hamad al Bagaawi’ s patrols. It being dark a fight ensued, and the caravan guards drove off the patrol by rifle fire. There were no casualties, but bhe contra bandists knowing the patrol would return with reinforce ments and feeling that with their laden camels they could not escape, deliberately unloaded thedir mercahndise PiJ 3dpiled it up in a heap «nd aa t it on fire. They them selves aoattered and have not been found yet. i’ae Bacond party unfortunately and quite accidently ran into the reinforced patrol, a piece of real bad luck, ae they were some 25 miles away from the scene Of the first incident, again a fight took place. This time A1 fcharaafi al Duusiri, the Commander of Bin Baud' B men was killed, an. also one of Bin Jaloui's 'Murra” 'treokers', who are employed by the Blockade author!tlea to 'run down' suspected contraband runiiers. Th * P atro '- again beat a retreat and ag. m the merchandise was heaped up and burnt bybthe owners. The contrabandists su. f ered no Ions find Alsp&lt;}X k s#6« It sofen became laiown,however, from spies locauod in uwalt that tho two parties belonged to the Braih, ai^d a! iHagaewl was not slow to strike. He seized 300 oa?a 0 ls of the tribe, and threatened Bin Sand's vongenoe, unless the names of the culprits wore given him* This has not been done as yet but a iihamari residing with the tribe has been handed over and made u scape goat of* On the loth July I On Ash wan, ill al Ohuwairibat and Xbn Jarbua, all leading hhaikhs of the tribe, decided to go to Kiath and lay their case before the King. All al Jhutfaribat and I bn Jarbua returned after they reached the ahana, their h-jarts failing them, and Ibn Ashwan proceeded alone. ./although the incident in our eyes appears small it is of first class importance among the Mutair. Should Kraih get no change out of Bin Jaud, and fall,to recover their camels, it 1c on the cards that they will attempt a mass entry into IraQ via hulaimiyeh, etc. The above incident a have in no way deterred the many other sportsmen engaged in running the Blockade,■■■■KSiKBBBansanniaBauKBMHBanBMKi 1 - ,&lt; „\*S^ -(B)- and the game goes merrily on# 111 • 1^4 ° f suitMai D ,rlng the 111011 th th0 following Shaikhs vl si ted the Political Agent# (a) haaifan Abn Shujara (AJraan) on 12th July 1933 . lb) Lafi ibn ae.lath Umteir) on 9th July 1933.

Lest it be reported in London by Shaikh Hafidh ^ahba, Bin baud’s clerer representative there, that the presence of these men in Kuwait, pre: sages something evil, such as a filibustering expedition 'tinto Najd or Hassa, or a rising of the AJman, etc., as recently was the case when Khalid ibn ’lathlain visited Kuwait, I give below a short sketch of the recent doings of each Shaikh# (a) ihaaifan abu Khulara . as stated lives with the Dhafir at present. He went north in June to the vici~ nity of Aleppo to visit his 3 sons who are in the French Syrian Caiaal Corps Service (a rather remarkable thing incidentally for members of the Ajman tribe of Hassa to do). His visit to Kuwait was to get a present from the Shaikh (an annual affair ’aada^) and to see m© and other Ajnan relations residing in this town, and of course to gather news for his present master. /hen I asked why he did not go back to his tribe, he said beacuse of Bin Saud# To use hie own words as nearlyU ** Uf Ta,,l,in * ho adventurers pur, Slmpl,, and that these men had ta-i^t the Kln« every deception, dseei* and unworthy conduct in dealing with hia subjects and in particular had taught him that it was no sin to break your wor* with a Bedouin. e laughingly and amusingly summed up the King's charac ter as his tribe saw it today, in the following words. 'Bin Baud is the greateet prasent giver, and moat wonderful person in the whole world to win a man'e confidence, if it suited him. At the same time, In treachery, cunning, cruelty and revengefulness he had no equal in all the world. Lastly in playing with 1 oreign nations and their representatives, and especially in making the English nation dance to hie tune, he was entirely first class, and unmatchajSble in all the world'. Shaikh Sha&amp;ifan left Kuwait for the Dhafir in Iraq on the 20th July. Mafi jb n aalath came to Kuwait to sea if hia tribe had been able to fix up some thine with the King whereby he could safely return to Najd. His oaae is rather a sad one and exemplifiee the hard methods of Bin Saud with those who hare the misfortune to cross him inno cently. Six months ago Shaikh Laafi, who at one time was one of Bin Saud^ most stalwart and trusty warriors,waa oampad in the ’tiumman' with his family. Hie brother came Into Kuwait to eee frlende, and on hie return was given a bag of rice value 8a.9/- by Hillal al mtairi the Pearl Merchant for Shaikh Saafi. On the Journey he was oeught by a blockade patrol who confi seated the riee. The patrol who had been told for whom the bag of rice was intended naxt/t^arrest Laafi.

Came to Kuwait to get money out of Hilal al Mutairi his protege and incidentally to give him news of his Trans Jordan visit* He had been sent by King Faisal from Baghdad to Bmioan with the 4 valuable camels which were bought in Kuwait last April (see para VI of Nummary Ho.81 of 26th April 1933) and which the King decided to present to his brother Abdulla. Mutluq's description of the Journey across the desert (he took 25 days), and of the things he saw and heard at Amman were amusing and interesting. He incidentally br ught various very cordial messages tmm for the Shaikh and myself from Amir Abdulla which might have been true or inventions of the wily liutluq. They wgreWare all verbal, waits possibly he also brought a secret letter for the Shaikh from the Amir, ohai h * utluq returned to Baghdad on the 2Qth July. Mit*. It might not be out of place hare to mention for the benefit of those who do not know, that there is little that goes on among the North Seat tribes of Najd and Hassa which does not come to my ears. I spend many hours weekly taTrlng to Bedouin Shaikhs, both and lew, and visiting their tents. Shaikhs, ordinary tribesmen and even the poorest of tribal women know they will find a welcome in my house, and more often than not go away with sane small present or other - the ladles usually with w a bag of rice or dates. hould there be any trouble brewing over the border I should be the first to know about it, for my visitors keep nothing back. As the cold weather approachee I return the compliment and go and camp with my Bedouin friends of all classes and sometimes for days at a time, not as an Englishman but as one of them. Iv « .JiM. Yemen and Aslr News. News from Riath has been obscure and somewhat disturb ing during July. Humours have been persistent that the King intends with the advent of the autumn to undertake some major operation in the direction of Aslr and Yemen. Tram Bedouin sources it is reported that Bln Baud has again started collecting arms, oemels and horses In Riath, and on a considerable scale and has instructed Ibn Jaloui in 'assa to 'tap” the Awazln tribe for camels. The Awazim supplied nothing during the winter and spring campaign of 1932-1933. It le even said that the tribe as a whole has been ordered to hold Itself in readiness to send a large quota of its young men to Aslr. A certain Kuwait merchant writing from HoceIda to theA -{•)- the Sheikh on the 8th July said that there were indi cation, erarywhere . that fighting would oonaoanoe with s.;: culc woather between Bln Sand and the Tm»m Yahya, and that/the ttrtn writer had felt It hie duty to warn other Kuwait merchant, further North to be ready to cloee down their bualnesa at a moment'a notion. The same Kuwait subject In a letter written to the Shaikh dated Hodel da the 27th July which arrived by air mall from Karachi gave the following more definite newa # (a) Tamen troop* recently attempted to enter i&gt;audi territory to the north west of lajran with the intention of cutting off the steady supply of arms and munitions which were coming to them from Saudi tribes notably the Qahtan* The latter had refused to allow the Imam’s troops to cross the border without the express orders of Ein Saud* Saif al Islam Ahmad had explained that he would accept all responsibilitybut the ,ahtan were adamant. The tribes of Kajran, the writer added 9 were largely in possession of Saudi rifles bearing the King’s name, and whleh had made the Yemen authorities suspicious. (b) i ^e Al Adrlsi has sent a fresh and J deputation to Sana'a for what , I purpose was not known. The Jlzan authorities (Saudi) were busy repairing the old forts which are scatter* ed over the country and were building many new ones* Work was going on hurriedly and much military activity was evident. i (c) Some 3 f 600 men with guns had reached Jizn between 8th and 27th of July. Theae had been sent down by the Hijaz Government by land and sea. (d) Munitions and foodstuffs were being collected in large quantities at Jlzan. (e) The Saudi Government was everywhere reported to be supporting the tribes of Najran openly with anas and ammunition, which had caused deep resentment among the people of Yemen. Heavy fighting was going on there between the Yemen Troops and the Ban! Yam tribe (f) The Imam had issued orders for reinforce ments of troops to be sent to the Al ifahmlat country. (g) The strictest censorship was being maintained by the tiaudi authorities in Aslr and all along the coast.

This seen* rather a far fetched view seeing that a hostile Aslr would he left in the army-e rear. On the other hand Bin 3aud may be tempted to risk a southern campaign if only for the sake of diverting the minds of his great tribes from their moody and n sullen hostility to himself. The King know, that there i, nothing like a war with remise of loot to remove dissatisfaction. He would do well, however, not to ask his northern tribesmen to go as far south .sir gain, hey simply W( uld not go. They had such a miserable time when they went last winter, what with disease and privation that nothing short of force t^tan undertake the long drawn journey again. A curious rumour reached Kuwait on 31at - ily that Bin Saud had suddenly gone blind in his erne eye and that Dr, Dame from 'ahrain had not r * a ^ y &amp;one to attend one of his wives but the King himself.

One copy is being sent direct to Jedda by Secret Bag via Baghdad and 5 copies to you for distribution. I regret that owing to great pressure of work, I was unable to submit a 'Sumnary' of news for the month of May. I. TRAC SHEPHERD TRIBES . The end of May saw the last of the Iraq shepherd tribes return to their homes on the Euphrates. This follows normal procedure. The shepherds fared Yery well whilst in Kuwait territory, and sold their wool and ghee in Kuwait at prices which they had not realized for some years. This may be put down to the exceptionally good grazing which the Winter of 1938-33 brought in its train.II * OX KUitAII' MEU'l'K/iT. ZOJSE. (a) Captain Papworth, E.E., attached to E.A.P. Headquarters, Baghdad, who has been engaged on the survey of Kuwait Principality, including the Kuwait neutral zone during the Winter and Spring of 1938-33, closed down all survey operations on the 19th ltoy,1933, owing to the advent of the hot weather* f* ) Captain Paywerth in a final report to the Political Agent, before leaving, stated that the only portions remaining to be surveyed were fa) a small strip on the north side of the Bay of Kuwait; (b) The north eastern seotion of the Neutral (o) Captain Papworth, stated that he hoped to return again in October of 1933, to complete these two portions. (d) It may not be out of place here to mention that Captain Papworth worked throughout in two parties, one party under himself dealing with the preliminary work of fixing points etc., etc*, while the second party under an assistant followed behind and made the detailed survey. fe) Both parties were equipped with field wireless sets, and were provided with permanent ©soorts and jni ilTi^Tlm . by the Shaikh of Kuwait. (f) Throughout the period of the survey operations no incidents occurred worthy of mention, except on 8th Kay, 1933, when Captain Papworth, who was camped at ftafrah in the Neutral 'one, received a report from a Kuwait tribesman (who had been maltreated by a Saudiyeh Blockade patrol, south of Arak) that a Saudian raid was contemplated on his camp, from across the border. Nothing however, eventuated and the report, as indeed the writer thought at the time, turned out to be a canard. (8)(g) Captain Papworth and the members of his staff made themselves extremely popular with the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Bedouin, with whom they oame in oontact, and earned golden opinions and praise for the taot and good will which they displayed, wherever they went# (h) The Shaikh generously expressed his appreciation to the writer of the way the survey operations had been carried out and especially praised Captain Papworth. The writer in reply addressed the Shaikh by letter and thanked him for the valuable assistance which had at all times been forthcoming from him and his officials# III POLITICAL AOKBTS IOUH TO THE souTHP^-sossra-or tsi: zqm: (a) Luring May, the writer visited Captain Papworth at Wafrah, and proceeded in a single car to the southern border of the Neutral Zone, visiting the hills of Hamiaa, Mutayi, Hafafat, and the wells of Shathaf and Arak on route. He got within a short distance of Ain al Abd, but owing to the bad going and the lack of time was unable to reaoh that very interesting spot# (b) According to Captain Papworth, Ain al Abd, consisted of an evil smelling spring of water rising in a circular basin 15 miles from the sea, and some 10 miles due east of Arak# The water consisted of H#S*S. (Sulphurated Hydrogen ) with very little buoyancy, and ilo^sd^ in a stream to the sea at the rate of approximately 1000 gallons a minute# (o) As a result of Captain Papworth's observations it was aeoertained that Arak lay just inside the Neutral Zone border, whilst Ain al Abd lay exaatly on the border line. This demolishes the oft made olaim o: ! the Nejd authorities that Arak is in Hejd territory.(&amp;) Another intareetlng disoovery made as a result of the survey was that the lower end of the Shagg depression lay 4 to 5 miles further west than as shown on the existing million sheet. IV. hlfl BAUD AJD THE PEARL BAMS OF HASSA . Towards the end of I&amp;ay and early in June persistent rumours were received in Kuwait to the effect that H.M.King Abdul Asis al Saud was preparing to launch a final economic attack on Kuwait. The method to be employed being as follows:- fa) A definite offer would be made to the Shaikh of Kuwait asking that the latter should fall in with certain proposals, to be made by the King for settling the Blockade impasse. The proposal would greatly benefit Nejd and Saudiyeh generally but not Kuwait, The King counted on the active and moral support of several thousands of Nejdis domiciled in &gt; Kuwait, who were to bring the necessary pressure on the Shaikh of Kuwait, at the right moment, (b) Should the Shaikh of Kuwait reject the King's offer then the Blockade was to be tightened up by the strengthening of the frontier patrols to doubie and even treble their present strengths, and a wireless station was to be established at Hafar al Batin and perhaps a field set at Jarriya al Ilya also, expressly with a view to assisting the Blockade staff in their duties. At the same time the King would notify His Majesty's Government and the Shaikh of Kuwait that the Kuwait pearling fleet was to be forbidden to operate on the Hassa Coast within the three mile limit - a ban that would gravely disorganize the Kuwait pearl industry, whose boats from time immemorial had been accustomed to operate on certain banks close in shore in the vioinity of Mishaab and Abu Ali. COMMENT. fa) The above stories, although very persistent, could not properly be termed anything tut rumours, so were not reported at the time by the writer, who orexerred :\ to await developments. (b) The arrival on the 15th June of the King's letter to the Shaikh, making the startling proposal that he fthe Shaikh)should raise his sea customs tariff to that ruling£)(&amp;') ruling in the King's dominions, and in return that the King should allow trade with the interior, tribal tribute only being taken, would now seem to give definite support to the stories mentioned above. V. BLOCKAPE (a) There have been no incidents worth reporting during May and June except for the persistent rumours mentioned in the preceding paragraph. (b) Bin Bauds latest Blockade proposal, which arrived in the form of a very obscurely worded letter to the Shaikh on 15th June, and which is mentioned in comment (b) of paragraph IV above, ie interesting. It is certainly the reverse of helpful. If studied, the offer resolves itself into the following:- 'I have blockaded Kuwait for 10 years, hoping to bring it to its knees: Kuwait is still alive though very sick. I propose making a last offer to the Shaikh, which if accepted, will mean giving Kuwait either its 'coup de grace' or forcing it finally to come under my Political control'. (o) Two points appear not to have been taken into consideration by the King in putting forward the proposal:- (a) He ignores the fact that the Shaikh and the mercantile community of Kuwait are very shrewd business men and oan be counted to see through the trap: , (b) He forgets (or pretends to forget) that Kuwait came into being, and has existed for the last hundred or so years solely by virtue of the faot that she, like Bahrain. 1 b a 'diBtrlWtlng centre H . Shat she exists and hae existed, by her 'transit' trade alone with ITorth East Nejd and Cassim, and that to encourage this trade to come in by the Kuwait door she has of set policy maintained her sea customs tariff at the low figure of 4$ (just as Bahrain has). (d)© (d) Clearly If the Shaikh of Ktow&amp;lt were to raise hie sea customs to that of Bin Bauds Basse Ports druidentaily his treaty with \xt forbids this), then Kuwait would at once lose here present advantage over the Baudlan ports of Jubail, Cat if and ojair, where a duty of fc$ to 100^ ad valorem is now imposed on imports (apart from the fc£/ transit dues paid to the Oovera^ent of iahrain). (e) It should not be forgotten that Kuwait porsesses no other means of trade, except thie H tran8it ,, trade, and her ftearl trade . She hae no m&amp;nufaotories, no agrioultural oommunity and no exports, (f) 7o any one residing in Kuwait and knowing local oonditiona, a oontinuanoe of the existing trade blockade would be far more to the advantage of the Kuwaiti merchant than to fall in with Bin faude offer, The merchant under the blockade oan at least do some business by running contraband goods into Hejd and Cassia: under Bln Bauds scheme he would simply die. VI, There is little to re ort under this head. All tribal groups have, at the time of writing, camped on water, where they will summer. Peace also reigns everywhere. (a) yhe Lutair are on the well® of Bafar, Safa, Baba, C&amp;raa, *abri, Jarriya, BOTE*Aw On 6.5.33 # - Jvlajid al Aega al Shugair (f^utair) On 1 « o« «j» 3 «— i^ishrif ibn Lanii w n S5«5*33 c «&gt; Majid al Majid w 15.6.33. - Abdulla al Hallaf (Bhafir) 16.6.33. - Shakhaiyir ibn Tawala fSharamap) 17.6.33. - £halid al Hathlain (from Baghdad) Ajman . al Ha t h la in at his own telling oame down to Kuwait to visit various members of the tribe and keep touoh. He seemed very disappointed that Bin Sauda Aeir operations had ended more or less satisfactorily for the King. He reported the oooupation of flejran by the Imaji Yahyas troops, and said there was a rumour that ibn Musaad had died of disease in Ebba, but that he did not believe this. He expressed the pious hope that the King would die soon, and then he (Khalid) would oome into his own, for 'I shall become Shaikh of all the Ajman, and lead them against the Al Saud and war with them till they or I shall be dead' (hie words). He, however, expressed affection for Saud al Arafa who was half an Ajman tribesman (his mother being an Ajmiyeh). He was the only one of the house of Al Saud, who was worth anything, he said. We shall invite him to join us and help us in the fight. Khalid returned to his camp with Anaza in the Wadian on Both June, 1933. VII. VISIT Oi SHAIKH OF KUWAIT TO zmnr. The Shaikh of Kuwait accompanied by his cousin Salman al Hamud and three leading merchants of Kuwait proceeded by private yacht to Bahrain on 18th June,1933. He is expected back on 2nd July.

Owing to pressure of wore, and trie fact that I have been Instructed to submit a fortnightly report on the local Oil situation I propose In future to confine myself to submitting a monthly Intelligence Summary instead of a fortnightly one.

This continues to be good everywhere, altliough the wild grasses and hay, are now everywhere turning yellow. The Bedouin according to custom will camp on the various permanent wells and water holes a out the epi of vay or possibly even later. The writerThe writer made three trips to the southern frontier durine the month under review and one to the Northern frontier of Kuwait. He hopes to moke a further trip to the Shalt) al Aujah at the extreme south west corner of Kuwait state, and to tour the Kuwait Neutral zone, before the hot weather finally eets in. II. I'kiHAL. (a) ■mere is very little to report under this head, peace reigns everywhere throughout Kuwait state, as well as in North-Saet Nejd. This is accounted for by the good grazing year which we are having. The Bedouin is bu^y fattening up his camels and sheep, and for the moment cares for little else. (b) The news that the Asir rebellion in virtually over, and that only desultory guerilla fighting continues has had a distin tly settling effect on the greet ’ edooin tribes. (c) The luck (heath) of the great King still apparently holds good and it is fortunate that it has confirm done so during the Aeir troubles, for all renorte/the wide discontent that exists against the Saudian regime these days especially in the North and North-east, and this might easily have resulted in trouble, had things gona wrong. (d) Almost every week now brings special messengers or secret informers from the interior edouin to their kinsman in Kuwait describing the heavy fighting that took place among the Asir mountains. All stories agree that it was of a most ruthless nature and that the Saudian troops further suffered from a sickness, which was unknown to them, and which carrier off fully a quarter of the total forces engaged. The sickness is said to have been cause' by drinking bad water, and amarently did not. affect he locallocal inhabitants. In a previous report the writer suggested 'virulent malaria', hut he is now inclined to think it wae typhoid, for a third of those -sho were attacked died, it is said. Ill- WAXSR DISPUTE BETmi? Itia alMAIT CDHAFE) Aim THE RRA I: (i'UTAIR) . As the time is not far distant for the Bedouin to decide Where to summer, AJemi as Suwait informed the Braih that he and his people intended camning on the wells at A1 Haffar. 'the Braih objected on the ground that the Haffar wells were theirs-from time immemorial, and that the rhaflr were their blood enemies, and that any attempt for both to draw water from tho same place throughout the Bummer would result in trouble. The matter me referred to the Amir Baud bin Abdul Aziz at Riath, and the latter gave judgement in favour of the Braih. The disconsolate Ajemi and his Kuwait following have now to find a suitable summer camping ground. Scouts of theirs have already visited Subaihiyeh, but no one wants them there, as Ajemi and his Qhafir might think it policy to please Bin Baud hie present liege Lord, by doing voluntary police and blockade work, inside Kuwait terri tory , with Subaihiyeh as his base. This course was adopted 2 years ago by jadaan al Suwait, and caused no little excitement and heartburning until he was turned out. One does not want to see it happen again. IV. BLOCKADE. The disturbing news has come in that Bin Saud has once again (he last did it in 1932) granted to the T'utair (especially the 'Br;iih' section of that tribe) permission to go up to Zubalr and purchase any supplies they required. The order particularly excluded i'uwait. which, as reported in this Agency Summary for arch, is more strictly blockaded then ever. The Shaikh4 ($) The Shfilkh of Kuwait In a long t lk w-ltii the writer on 24th April 1923;. whilst reporting the news, rather pathetically, said that anparently It was no good his saying any hing more to His 'ajeatyGovernment against this unfair and preferential treatment ar all hio other reouests to the British Government to see that Justice should be done him by hie neighbours, in thl-i a* well as other matters, were never taken notice of. 'Talk there had been In plenty he said 'but no satisfactory or concrete decision has yet resulted'your Government', he added, 'seem to have forgotten how to act these days, and only like to talk , until people get so tired that the point in dispute dies a natural death'.

EXECUTION OF A B.-1TI h 3'Jv' (T (SQ ALll 1L ittfrai- U.tt»So(31 The story is going round the town that a certain jum'ah bin Moharneu Yahva, a British subject from Somaliland together with two other Somali subjects (names not known) were recently executed in Riath by orders of s is ajesty the King. Tney are said to have been charged with (a) spying for the Idrisi (b) attempting to arrange for certain high Asiri prisoners to escape from Riath by cr. Hie m«n jum'ah resided in Kuwait for some yeara and kept a coffee shop in the main baa^ar. hen Bin Rnud came up to Khabari TCadha after the Akhwan rebellion of 1929-30, he was taken on ae a motor driver by the King and for o time got on very well, it is said, with his In January 1933, . ura’aii visited Kuwait by c* r from master.from Riath to settle some private debts which he ow?d. He took the opportunity to call at His Majesty's Agency on 23rd January and asked that his name should be regis tered in the local Register of British subjects, as it was proved that his home was in Kuwait hi &lt; request war granted. Reports from Riath are too unreliable these days to Justify the writer taking the matter un officially, but the story is mentioned in the hopes that His Majesty's Minister at Jeddah may perhaps be able to set encuirier on foot with a view to find out «(hether there is any truth in the report. On 15th April Ibn Mlkraad of the A1 Mahfudh section of the AJman, a Shaikh loyal to Bin Saud, and 'peraona grata* with Ibn Jaloui, visited Kuwait to obtain certain customary largesse from the Shaikh. He studiously r frained from visiting the Agency, as he was wont to do in past ..years, (I suspect at the Instance of the Shaikh). On 18th April Shaikh ffutlaq as Sur left Kuwait for Bagdad by the desert route, taking four valuable camels which he hnd purchased from Shaikh hubah al aeir al sub all for His Majesty King Faisal. VIT. KUWAIT SURV+iY PMH- About the middle of April, Captain Papworth,R.E., re-entered the Kuwait Neutral Zone to couplets the survey work he is engaged on.

Sir, In continuation of my Confidential Summary No.48 dated the 5th March, 1933, I have the honour to forward the following items of local, hinterland, and Nej d news. A copy of this is being sent direct to Jedda by Secret bag via Baghdad and 5 copies to you for distribution. I regret that pressure of work during March prevented me from submitting a report for the first half of March. I. GRAZING SITUATION. Purther welcome rains fell in Kuwait on 15th and 29th March, and materially assisted what must be called a record rain season. The total rainfall in Kuwait town for the Winter of 1932-33 up to the end of March now stands at 4.97 - much more fell in the hinterland. Grazing everywhere is rich and plentiful and vast quantities of green hay are daily being brought into Kuwait Town for sale to horse and cattle owners. The writer made four tours to various points on the southern463 and South-western border of Kuwait state during March and was amazed to see the wonderful variety of grasses and wild flowers that everywhere have come up. In one area alone •2 different varieties of wild flowers were classified and pressed for record purposes,not to mention of 13 different hinds ol grasses. The oldest inhabitant does not remember to have seen such a wonderful year. II. TRIBAL. (a) In Kuwait Summary No*37, dated the 13th February 1933 (para II (b) mention was made of the tendency then in evidence for the North East Tribes of Arabia to con centrate in various areas, because of their uncertainty of the future and the bad news that was daily filtering through regarding the Asir operations of the King. In particular note was made that the Awazim tribe had moved up the Shafl and were entering the Kuwait neutral Zone and Kuwait territory near Manaqish. The move was no doubt spotted by Bin Saud at the same time, for orders were promptly issued to the Chief Blockade Officer Hamud al- Baqaa^i to turn the Awazim back. This was done about 15th March when several parties of A1 Baqaawis men entered the Kuwait Neutral Zone and ordered all Awazim sections to move south again. Messengers were also sent to those Awazim who had crossed the border between Manaqish and Rigai ordering them to return into Nejd territory again. At the same time orders were passed to certain Kuwait Araibdar who were grazing their sheep and camels south of Arak (Neutral Zone) to leave Nejd territory. This they did. The above orders and moves were done quietly and without ostentation,but nevertheless were against all understood procedure and time honoured custom which allows forfor the tribesmen of both sides to move across the border separating Nejd and Kuwait, at will, if in search of grazing. (b) There is nothing of particular interest to report about the Ajman, Mutair, Awazim or Harb tribes. III. BLOCKADE, (a) This continued to be enforced with all the severity that Abdulla bin Jaloui is capable of, without his going so far as to actually violate the Kuwait frontier line or create an incident. (b) Blockade posts now exist at Rigai (S.W.corner of Kuwait State), at Khabrat al Duwish ( a point a little south west of Manaqish and midway between Rigai and the sea) and at Araq on the southern border of the Kuwait neutral zone. Each post consists of some 12 men, while camel patrols continuously move between the posts themselves and hold up all suspicious looking persons* (c) Not only is nothing in the form of merchandise allowed to get through from Kuwait to Nejd now, but the movement of tribesmen, especially Nejdis wishing to visit friends and relatives in Kuwait has been restricted to a mere trickle. ( d) The visits of occasional Mutair Shaikhs and their ladies which were a feature six months ago and previous to that have now ceased almost entirely. It is kopec, that this is only a temporary set back, for they were the Political Agent*s chief source of information for happenings in the interior and always very interesting. IV.AUJAK ERONTIER INCIDENT. The story is widely current in Kuwait,and retailed with amusement as an excellent story among thelocal Bedouin cf how Ibn Shajaan, the Surly Officer in charge of Bin Saudfe Blockade post at Rigai, recently tnouglit fit to change camp and quietly moved into IRAQ, territory. A few hours after he was greeted by a party of IRAQ Desert Police who ordered Ibn Shajaan to quit immediately else he would be fired on. The latter,who had with much trouble just pitched camp in the Nahr Aujah, had to pull his tents down again and retire discomfit ted* One docs not know if one has got the exact details correctly but suffice tc say the opinion is general that the IRAQ, Government are keeping very wide awake on their border and seem to know how to 1 nip in the bud* any f try on* of Bin Baud’s braves* It is a pity the Shaikh of Kuwait does not learn a few lessons from his neighbours methods. Too often has he lext his Political Agent tc do the ’quick moving’ and 'straffing' in similar instances on the Kuwait border. V. ASIR KBBMjLIOK. In spite of the official statements emanating from Bin Baud that the Asir rebellion had been put down successfully, stories have continued to come in from the desert and especially from the Mutair that heavy fighting had taken place between Ibn Musaads forces and those of the Idrisi, as late as the last week in February. Hillal al Mutairi of the Diyahin Section of the Mutair, who always keeps good touch with desert events told the writer on 1st April that he had received several messengers from different quarters of Nejd as late as 26th March 1933, and notably from Al Shallahi of the Bani Abdullah, a reliable friend of his, which after some siftingsifting could be summarized as follows:- (a) (t) (c) bn Kus aad had fought a heavy engaeer’ent vji+&gt;i in me c.ereat and retirement on Ebha; J bn ^ S ' aade force s were more or m Ebha, and were suffering from lessinvested sickness; reinforcements had been asked was serious; fcr as the situation (d) (e) that Sabiya and Jezzan and other outlying towns haa fallen again into the rebels hands; that following Hejd leaders had been killed:- (f) (g) (h) U) Two Shaikhs from the A1 Sabhan (Rashid) I bn Khashman (Harb) Khalid bin Luwai and his son Saad (reported in previous summary Abal ’Ala) Shaikhs of Ataiba. Ibn Jama ) Kchamed bin Sahmi ) shaikhs of V/alad Faisal bin Hashar ) Qahtan. The Hamadin Section of the Mutair (Ibn Musaiyis people; had been wiped out entirely; Four personal guards of Ibn Mus'aad had been killed defending their master in a hand to hand encounter: Ibn oagaiyan of the Mutair, by great personal bravery and leadership had saved Ibn Kus»aad f s broker forces and led them in safety back to Ebha: Grazing between Sha»ara in Nejd and Ebha was non* existent, so movements of camels, horses and supplies of sheep had been severely handicapped. but Y/hile one cannot/think the above is merely old news dished up afresh among the Mutair for anti-Bin Saud propaganda purposes, it seems pretty clear that in spite of all Nejdean communiques, guerilla fighting of severity continues round about Ebha. This is more or less conformed by the fact that ibn Mus f as.d is still in Asir and cannot afford to allow any of his forces to return home.VI GEITBRAL- K.B.Andul Latif bin Abdul Jaleel, late Custome director of Kuwait, who for many months has been in Kejd returned to Kuwait on 4th April via Bahrain, H e had much to tay of ax fairs there. Most of the items of information which he could produce may be summarized as follows (a) The Asir rebellion was practically over, and the I drisi a fugitive in Yemen, (b) Ibn Mus 1 aad was busy pacifying Asir and would remain there personally for some time, (c) Fighting in Asir had been exceptionally heavy but was now over, except for sporadic guerrila warfare, ( d) Bin Baud was bankrupt and desperately in need of money, (e) To raise the wind he had called a conference of Oil representatives to Jedda and was about to make them bid one against the other, ( f) Bin Baud was still very pro-British but was ■sTowly succumbing to the flattery and wiles of the Soviet Minister in Jedda to the real disadvantage of British interests, (g) That Bin Baud intended shortly to greatly tighten up the Kuwait Blockade,and to this end had ordered a wireless station to be erected at Haffar al Batin, Much more in the same strain was said which is not worth while reporting, I have etc., (Sgd) H.R.P.Dickson,Lt.

These are now more or less scattered along a line roughly from the Kuwait Heutral Zone to Um Amerat al 1 ahzul in the Kuwait Dibdlbba. The reason for this is the wonderful pasturage which exists everywhere; each tent-dweller being tempted to separate from his neighbour in search of the best grazing and the greater confidence which exists as a result of Al Hibai's visit to Kuwait with letters from Bin Baud. With&lt; 4 ^ '«th the Fiddawiyeh are now camped many Kuwait householders who profiting by the beautiful Spring weat’er have gone under canv*« n anvas in large numbers. This is particularly the case closer into the Town. lb) Jhafly r Jadaan al ^uwait an ; a faw following are reported to be in the Kuwait *ibdibba Zone but the majority of the Ihafir tribesmen who till recently were in Kuwait have returned acroee the Batin into IRA* territory.

Awazim Harb except that there appears to be a spirit of greater confidence in the air brought about by better news from Kiath i„ r9g ard to the Asir rebellion. The idea appears to be getting hold that the Idrisi»s main forces have definitely been defeated.although guerilla warfare is still being carried on by the stout-hearted in the more inaccessible parte of Asir. On the other hand the best opinion has it that Bin Baud’s forces in Asir are by no means out of the wood yet and only time will show exactly what the true situation is. (d) That this uncertainty is shared by the more northern Bedouin tribes of IRA^, who are all watching events with the greatest care, may be instanced by the continued presence of Shaikh Kutluq al Sur in Kuwait territory and the arrival of K'aif ibn Huraaid from IRA* at the end of the month. Both these Shaikhs are important refugees from Rejd and with other Mutair and Ajman refugees receive«« a«n, «h.„ olJ „ ot b« in for this. (.) 0„ ,n. 26th . „„, ne „ ^ th&gt; of th.

Incidentally both Shaikhs touched on the question of the possible introduction of a new Conscription Law in IRAq.

(a) His Majesty the .ing of Sa , udiyah was reliably reported tobe camped at A 1 Khafa, 60 miles Horth of Riath, during the period under review. At the end of February he is said to have gone up to Kafar al Atz on a hunting expedition and than to have turned south to Rurnah and Rum ah iy eh. (Authority the Shaikh of Kuwait). (b) The Amir Saud bin Abdul Aziz is said to have crossed the Dahana and entered the kutair country (Suimnan) about the 25th of February. He was also on a hunting expedition. (Authority the Shaikh of Kuwait). (c) The King* s brother-in-law, Saud al Arafa, was reported by a Mutair tribesman to be at Turaibi on 15th February and from there proceeded to al Thamam close by. Kot^ It is probable that Saud al Arafa (c) and the Amir Saud (b) have been confused; as Saud al Arafa was reliably reported to have been sent to Hecca in January as he could not be trusted. See summary K'o.37, dated 15th February 1933 para.lTV. (a). (d) Abdulla bin Jaloui is repotted to have visittfd Bin Saud somewhere at the end of February (Where? It is not certain). And asked permission to go on the Haj. His reauest was refused and he was ordered to remain in Hassa in view of the uncertain situation. Kote. The writer interviewed Ibn Juma, Shaikh of the Awazira on the southern frontier of Kuwait on 24th February. The latter had just come from Hoffuf and said that Ibn Jaloui had told him on 15th February that he was to meet the king in the Summan area at the end of February.

( i) One Half ibn ussaiyia ibn Jaajun, a minor ohaikh o e hut air, who was sent to Asir with the Braih contingent is r «P°^ed to have secretly returned on 18th February to the Mutair tribe (a fugitive) from the front. According to his story, wnich must be taken with the oroverbial •grain of salt he with Khalld bin ..uwai 1 force w- en t he Irtter was destroyed. The attackers apparently rushed Khalid 1 s camp at 1 a.ra* and completely eurprieed the defenders. They (the attackers) were all dressed in dark blue shirts or smocks.

HIBAI TO iCU AITj (a) On 15th February Al Ribai, Bin Saud* s well-known and con i ;»r,tial messenger arrived in Kuwait from Riath with tae writer who knows him well. The King’s missive consisted of the usual covering 1 * ttsr ■ , ' ith ? ‘'ulhaq*. The first of these apologised for his (the King's) inability to visit Kuwait this Spring as he had promised in February 1932.botb because of heavy work in oornnction with the Asir rebellion and because from Kuwait his travelling wireless set could not reach Riath, which he had to keep in touch with. The message ended, by saying that his servant Al Ribai woul d have something else | to disclose verbally. TTv ' second 1 ulhaq dealt with the Asir rebellion and t e -progress of Ms army and ran as foil owe:- 'Brother May God save you* Ve n.re -ol^esed to send Al Hubai to Pke enquiriei about your health and to convey to you the good news that God has graciously conferred upon the Muslims by the putting down of this seditious rebell ion. The Idrisi and all those wo were with him,and the whole country and population unaer the Idrisi was over-run by the Muslim?., to whom the whole population surrendered. The people are now tranquil and quiet. Thanks be to God for same. Only the Idrisi with a few persons excaped to Yahya^ territory.

They duly reached (Asir) where they found the remanant of those who had stirred up t ie rebellion hiding themselves in the mountains, 3o e of t^ese were killed and some captured, 3 he country is now being administered by Ibn •use ad and the committee which accompanied him. They also are negotiating the conclusion of the frontier treaty with Yahya and are reconciling certain tribes of .Najran at feud with each other. Thanks to God, all ratters turned out as we wished t e’fi to do. As both o us are concerned and will rejoice at this, we decided to send you the good news'. 4 This refers to the defeat and death of hhalid ibn Luwai. (bj : On receipt of the King 1 © letter, the Shaikh maae two long and mysterious car journeys to Khabari Wadha and and a point in the ?iriya area, south east of dafa. The first journey was uade on 20th February, the Shaikh returning late on 23rd February while the second was on 25th February the return being on 27th February and late at night. (c) The Shaikh was aceo??iranied by Shaikh Abdulla al Salim; Shaikh Salman al Hamud; hie eon ohamed; Yusuf al Salim, brother of his Basrah Agent; and Ho harmed Yatim, Hajor Holmes’s confidential Agent. (d) Incidentally the Shaikh never tef(»s ’members of his own family out hunting, as he pretended was the case on(e) Although nothing h«e eince cone out to pror- the f eory, the writer helievee (though he says this very guardedly) that the Shaikh of Kuwait met either the King or his son. Saud (the Amir), or possibly, though not nrobeble, .aud al Arafa, in the vicinity of ’A 1 Haba’ wells, south east of Safa. (f) If the above meeting did actually taie place one may I t^ink. Justifiably conclude that two things were discussed; (a) Bin oaud*s desperate need for looney; (b) Oil matters. Under (a) it is not entirely beyond the bounds of possibility that he a Steed for a loan in return for some relief from the Blockade. tf (b) was discussed - also with the intention of getting money - the presence of Major Holmes*• emissary with the Shaikh*s nerty is significant. (g) The Shaikh of Juwait subsequently told the writer in confidence that Bin Saud had sent a secret message by Al Ribai suggesting that he (Al Ribai) should act as leader of the Kuwait Haj # of 1933 to prpvent its being troubled by any one in Kejd,esoecially by certain lawless parties, who were wandering about passim, but that he (the Shaikh) had rejected the offer politely,knowing t lat the next step would be that money would be demanded for Al Ribai's services; and that if once such a suggestion were agreed to a precedent would oe created and regular •black-mail* would be levied every succeeding year from the Shaikh of Kuwait and his people, much as the Ibn Raschids of Hail used to levy suns fro 5 n the Turks and PersiansPersians for 'roviding so called protection for pilgrims moring across Arabia. The Shaikh laughingly said this was another of the King's -try on's*; and that the idea of the aj being molested in Sa'diyah was ridiculous in the extras K ote. The above story. I believe to be true; but it is »or» likely that it came from the King himself or the Mir Baud and that A1 Ribai only arranged the dates of the secret me®ting in the desert. I hsve etc., (Sgd) R, P.

Rain Situation. !■ mmm wumwin nm (a) Another inch of rain fell oyer the whole of Kuwait State on the night of the 12th/13th February - making a total of 4.36 inches to date for the whole year. (b) The writer was camped on the southern border of the state near Grain, when the aboye rain fell, and as far as could be ascertained from personal observation and Bedouin report the depression which brought the rain extended oyer the whole of tforth Haasa and inland oyer the Summan area (Hutair country). (a) The above further welcome rain makes the grazing situation for the nomad population of North East Arabia entirely safe for the Spring and Summer of 1933.II. Tribal, MuntaTlk Shepherd Trih ftc .. These as was anticipated hare all come pouring out oi* ’IRAQ, and are at the moment of writing hastening South through Kuwait territory, and are making for the Kuwait Neutral /&gt;one, the Vaeaim area and the coastal region to the South of it. Their tents and flocks oan be seen all along the Safwan Hahrah road, and to the South on the line Jahrah Subaihiyah, and are an inspiriting sight. This advent of these 'Shawiyeh” or 'Hakkra” tribes as they are locally known, is a normal one, and is welcomed by everyone, for it means cheap wool, meat, milk, butter etc., anu a general sij'n that the Spring and Summer will be a good one. It is easy to recognise these northern people or white variety as Opposed to the black sheep of Kuwait, North ftoot Nejd and Haasa: (bj There is nothing particular to report about thes Ajman Mutair Awazim, Harb. Kuwait iraibdar. ) except that there is a wide spread feeling that matters are going badly with Bin Sa^d and his forces in Asir, Hence following the custom of all tribal folk there is a tendency to concentrate, so as to be prepared for the worst. This * f worst n means 'the game of raid and counter raid, and every tribe against its neighbour.” ItIt mtxy be mentioned in pasting that a strong Bin ba f ud means, and has always meant, that the tribee oannot raid each other, or satisfy their blood feuds, in the way they would like to, or as Nature intended \aoooraing to them) that they should be settled. Hence though enforced peace to-day reigns throughout the ..a’udiyah ^ ingdom, it is by no means a pleasing peace; therefore with rumours growing stronger every day that Bin :;a f ud has suffered a series of defeats, and that many oi his /ikhwan troops have deserted his standard, the great tribes or most of them are everywhere showing signs of pleasurable restlessness and are metaphorically apeaicing sharpening up their weapons and cleaning rifles: An old Ajman chieftain recently put it rather nicely to the writer, when asked what he would do if Bin Sa'ud died, or his empire broke up - ’’'e shall go back to the good old days of raid and be raided with God helping the bravest and everyonegetting a chance of i paying oft old Scores’’ • He said this with such apparent Joy, that it was difficult not to believe th^t he meant it. This tendency to concentrate, when troublesome times are ahead, may be seen in the following movements now in progress: (a) The of liassa are ciosin:: in on Nta 1 . (b) The Aw&amp;zim are slowly moving up the f&gt;haq towards Kuwait territory, and the Dhafir, their allies, who have recently entered Kuwait in numbers;, anci are nov to the Hast of the Batin b Idairat al-&gt;hilla (west end of liyah) under Jad’an and Hantush.(o) Th# Inutair (Ilwa) are closing up in the Summon region. (d) The Kuwait Pidawiyeh and Araibdar (largely Ajman) are moving from the Garaa region (west of the Shaq) into the Kuwait Neutral Zone so as to be near the Ajman in North Hassa. (e; Al-^irm and his Haro are doing likewise round about Ajibba. ihe whole local Bedouin world of course recognises what these mores portend, and are anxiously waiting for news. Should all turn out well and Bin Sa f ud be victorious, the tribes will quietly scatter again and nothing further will be said. (c) Shaikh Jadaan as-Suwait of the Bhafir visited the iolitioal Agent on the 10th February, 193.3. He had [ no news to give, beyond praising the rains which had fallen everywhere. tie appeared still the disgruntled man, who could not decide whether to side with Bin Sa f ud or f IHAq. He mentioned that he never went in to Nasiriyeh to pay hie respects to the 1 IHAq Governor there, nor did he intend to do so, ae long as they did not recognise him as the head of the Dhafir. He reaffirmed his decision not to serve under Ajemi as-Suwait who was the Bhufiri chief on Bin Sa’ud’s side, and so it is presumed will continue to wander about n No man's land.” One cannot help liking hf.ikh Jadaan if for no other reason that he is all ''pride”, and continues to feel for Captain Glubb, his old mentor, a most staunch affection and loyalty - with tears in his eyes he said recentlyrecently to the writer 'Captain Olubb will alwaye be more than father and brother to me, and to my dying day I shall not forget his goodness to me.* (d) Ajemi as-Suwait was recently camped near Higal in the Hahr aujah, and had words with ibn 3 hajaan the Jommander of Bin Sa'ud'a patrol camped at Rigai* Apparently the latter did not wish him to water his oamels there, and the former did so by force. (e) Shaikh I/iUtlaq as-Sur, the tutair chieftain at the court of King Faisal again visited Kuwait on the 9 th February, 1933 after a month's absence. See paragraph II (e'Aand last paragraph of Summary No .10 dated 19th January, 1933, and ' after note ^ to Summary No.alb dated Band December, 193B. Outwardly his risit is for the purpose of buying good riding camels, of which he has bought 4 for 800/- from Shaikh Subah an-Nasir as-Subah: one suspects his real mission is to watch events in Aeir and if times are favourable, to try and stir up trouble among the ^utair. (f) An-Nafisi, Bin Sa'udJa trade Agent in Kuwait, visited the writer on Kth February, 1933 and took trouble to explain that things were marching satisfactorily in Asir, and that Bin Musa'ad, Commander of the main army of the King, had successfully reached Kbha. He admitted that Khalid bin luw&amp;l was dead. He believed that ths King would shortly come up to the Mutair country and camp at Khabari atha. The report had not only come through from rtawiyeh, but al-^usaibi from Bahrain had suggested to him by letter that this wab the intention of the i ing. Comment : This reported intention of the King is well xnown among the -jman and . utair, who prefer to understandby it that Bin a'ud i 8 in diffioulties, and wants th* northern tribes to thinlc that all is so well , that he can af■ord to go hunting near Kuwait. Kuwait Surrey Party. Captain i apworth, H.JS., entered the Kuwait Neutral ’.one on 4th February via Innaqish and Khabrat Buwish, haring previously obtained permission from Air Headquarters to do so. He pitched hie base oamp at Thaiaiat as-Sur, a point some 7 miles South West of Jebel Powarie, and on the western edge of the Kestrel Zone. ^rom this ^oint he daily motored to the various important features in the Neutral Zone, whose position he wanted to fix. The writer was not told that Captain Papworth had aotually entered the Neutral Zone, and hearing from Bedouin sources that he was at Thalaiat aa~Sur, proceeded there on 6 th February, both to see whether all was well v^ith him, and to enquire if he had received formal permission to start work in the Zone. The journey to the survey officer’s camp was made via iiraifjan, Irain, Jebel Powoxis, ana the return journey by another route 10 miles to the South of Khor el-Orain. Kverywhere were found pools and lakes of water showing that extra heavy rain had fallen there. At Jebel Fowaris the writer searched for and located the Sulphuric Acid Gas ’’Kacapea”, which are reported to exist there, and whioh are believed to indicate possible ”oil w deposits. Mrs. Dickson accompanied the writer. Asir Rebellion and ^iath News. I. The following iteats of news were brought in to the writer on 10th February, 1933, by an Ajman Shaikh,who left iiiath on 26th January. The man hae been Jcnown to the writer for 4 * yeara, and haa proved himself to be rfcjiiftbld on oHidi* oooionsj• (1) The war in Aslr ie being by no means as suooesaful as Sa'udi reports would make out. Three expeditions had entered A.eiri (a) That sent by Amir ?aieal direst from Hejaz. (b) That whioh went under khalid bin luwai from f iurat&gt;a. (°) aUo t&amp;ain ^oroa under 3bn -usa*ad» Governor of Halle # (a] waa partially Buooesaful, but only along the coasts (b, suiiered a defeat, ^halid bin luwai beln# killed, an his foroe dispersed. (o) had reached Kbha, but was suffering from a f strange malady (probably malaria). ^ (2) The death of Khalid bin luwai was admitted to the informer by the king himself. (3) The king had sent all the available forces he could muster into A.eir, and if he was beaten the consequences would be moat serious. (4) Both the northern tribes, find the king realised this, and while the former were content to await events, the latter by means of hunting expeditions and marrying round Riath was attempting to show that things were going on well. (5) Bin Sa’ud was keeping up a strict censorship in Klath, and had r iiaed a Town Guard of 400 men to enforce order there. A 'Curfew* regime was in full force in the Capital. ( 6 ) No one in Riath was allowed to know any news that oame in from the front. This for the most part arrivedarriTed by wiMleae, and the King epent muoh time daily in the wireleea operators room. (7) In epite of the etrlotneee of the oeneorehip the newe had leaded out that the Ataibah under Ibn abal'an had returned home against ordere. Only a defeat would bring this about. ( 6 ) Both Muhammad ao-Sa'ud, the King's brother, and Sa'ud al-'Arafah had been sent in to Mecca. The informer was of opinion that the King could not trust them at the capital, hence the order# (9) Both ba'ud al- ! A.rafiah and his son Kh&amp;lld, who had long been known as friends and patrons of the Ajman tribe, expressed their secret pleasure to the informer, that trouble had come upon the king and 3a*ud al-’Arafah even upbraided him, the informer, for bringing a mare as a present to the King. 'Keep all the horaea you have got because soon you will need them yourselves” is the remark he is reported to have made# ( 10 ) Abdullah ibn Jaloui of Hassa had sent large supplies of camels to Riath and many tents, but no men reinforcements# (11) Ibn Jaloui's son Sa'ud was being sent to Hail to act as Governor vice Ibn Musa 1 ad absent at Beha with the expedition. (12) The following tribes had all gone to the 'war', apart from large contingents of 'Hathar' (to*.mepeople): f Atalba# Horb (western section) not al-^irm. D&amp;wasir# Qahtan# Braih. ) ) Mutair of western and Ban! Abdilla. ) central Hejd.Sbei* : 0 Buqum and most of the troops had been issued with new ’short rifles” of some sort of Osman pattern, (these are probably of Polish origin). (lo; xhe informer summed up the situation by saying that the war was everywhere looked upon as the turning point in Bin ba f ud f s history, as he had put out his whole strength. If he lost he was certainly finished. If on the other hand he won, he would come out of the ordeal with greatly impaired strength and prestige (14) A sign of the times raa the better treatment of ibn Hathlain, ibn Lami and ibn Humaid, the almost forgotten state prisoners. Their food was better, and they were now allowed to see their women folk (all except ibn Humaid). (15) The Ajman tribe as a whole was also receiving much better treatment than formerly, and the Amir Sa*ud was especially anxious to win their favour (16) The Amir of Saqir Utaiba), who had recently been imprisoned in Riath, attempted to escape whilst the informer was in Riath. He failed owing to the cord breaking by which he was descending from the wall. He was publicly shot. (17) The King to prevent people talking about 'disasters' etc., as they were doing, spent much time in hunting round Riath and had again married a tribal lady. This, said the informer, was an old trick of his when trouble was abroad. The bedouins put this at its face value. II(SM H. On 12 th is’abru.iry another Ajman petty chief, who left Uath on 1st ’ebruary, brought the newe into Kuwait that: (a/ large bodies of Ibn Musa’ad Akhwan had deserted by night (probably Ataiba). (b: TCmpty lorries had returned to Riath with news of these desertions; but the king was trying to keep the matter as dark as possible. (c) hverywhere en route and right up to Kuwait the Bedouins were getting the idea that the King had baen defeated, and the informer saw evidences •Tory here of wide spread despondency and alarm. Jornnient : The above 'Gossip' has been repeated for what it is worth by the writer, almost word for word as he got it from the two Ajman hhaikhs. It must not be forgotten however that the Ajmaii tribe is as a whole intensely disloyal to His Majesty King Bin Sa f ud, and together with the Mutalr would like nothing better than to see the 'Great King' brought low. At the same time the spirit of anxiety and expectation, which one sees everywhere, and the evidences of tribes moving towards friends and concentrating for safety, all mean something, said it would be unwise to disregard them entirely.

In * Mir ttobomoyi, J o further news of reliable nature has reached Kuwait during the fortnight under review. As far as the Shaikh of Kuwslt and the writer can gather Bin Baud has managed to crush t 'e rebellion after eor.e heavy fighting. The son of Jaffran al Kuqm, a prominent t utairi Shaikh who visited Kuwait on 31st January (from Jarriya).tol d th# writer that while the lutalr and AJraan had all hoped that Bin SaudS forces would be beaten, the wild stories that gained ground earlier in the month, ouch as the reported death of Ibn Musaad and Khalid bin Luwai had no foundation in fact, ho detailed rerorts had yet come north regarding the success or otherwise of the King’s Expeditionary force which left Riyadh for 3bha in mid Decaraber, but tribal gossip had it that all was well with it. This it is thought pretty well seises un the situation. IV. Blockade. Nothing fr-'sh to report. V. Ku^ail-^Brvqy. J n Ttfr (a) It is satisfactory to learn that His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda was able to convince the * ing that there was no truth in the ridiculous report,which had readied i ecca, t ^ that the Royal Air Force Survoy Party,under Captain Papworth, Ijb X R. i., was inter faring with the Ku^ait-^ajd boundary line. What was actually meant is somewhat difficult to follow at this end* Sufficient ia to say that no boundary marks of any sort exist anywhere along the whole frontier, and certainly no ordinary Bedouin knows exactly whore the frontier line runs* The latter was only marked on official British maps alter the OJair Conference of 1923, and even the Shaikh of Kuwait himself had the most 'hasy* ides, as to exactly where the frontier was. untilcsw until f he writer took him in hand 2 years ago and motored him along the approximate line, which the frontier made by us, followed. lb) Reports receired at the end of January ehow that the King has agreed to allow the Surrey Party to work in the Kuwait 1 eutmi Zone, and has waived hi® original request that a Maud! representative should work with the party. This is minently sat is factory, as Captain Papworth the Survey Officer has for sometime been most anxious to get on with his vork. which has been held up. Th^ Saudi foreign Minister’s later suggestion that time was required to ensure that proper measures were taken for the party’s safety in the Meutral Zone need not, as mentioned by His Majesty’s Minister, be taken seriously. The Bedouins now in the Neutral Zone end south of it consist of very harmless Kuwaiti,and Awaaim tribesmen, who always are mont ready to welcome any English men among them. The neighbouring tribes also of North Hassa are old Kuwait subjects and most friendly to any one coming south into their country. (c) The report that reached the King of supposed inter ference of frontier marks, of course emanated from one of the many miserable agents that Bin Ssud maintains in &gt; u ait, and is a good example of the mischief that these worthies ars forever attempting to create. They naturally want to gain the King’s notice else no pay comes t eir way; hence they have recourse to fabrication on t ie least excuse. These agents are for fhe most part young iRen out of work and occupy their time loafing in the market square taking the names of any miserable Nejd tribesman who may have run the blockade in search of a little rice or piece of clothing. Names are subsequentlyV 7 V , subsequently sent out to A 1 Bsgaawi, Bln Saud-s ft-ontler Officer.and the letter welt, for his man and duly punishes him ’ h ® n c * ught - The ’''■t of It Is the spy. evidence is always P to be above doubt. V1 * 3Elall_of the Amir His excellency the Shaikh told the writer on 31st Ja ” UBry 1933 that th * Pe was a strong Bedouin rumour that the Amir Saud. eldest son of the King was shortly visiting Kuwait. in place of hi, august father, who had last year promised to honour Kuv.-ait with his presence in the spring of 1033 . There is nothing official to confirm the rumour. vn - Persian l aws. His Excellency the Shaikh reported on 30th January that Pereia had forbidden all her subjects to travel to Kuwait for trading or other purposes as from the iiew Year. One is given to wonder what is behind the order (if true). Possibly the recent seizure of a Kuwait dhow in the mouth of Shatt al Arab which resulted in an official protest to Tehran, may have something to do with tbe matter, VI11 • ZhSLl&amp;L A&amp;en oy in Kuwait. Th« building of* the ol it leal Agents new house has given rise to the rumour that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is to transfer his headquarters over the Kuwait. The story it is supposed started with one of Bin Baud's agents in uwait.wns reported to Riyadh,an; earaa back from there as a •fact*. Certain it is that r ip Majesty the King is taking quite a fatherly interest in the construct ion of the building and on two occasions recently enquired from visitors to Riyadh as to details of the new house and how it was progressing. 1 h??ve etc., (Sgd) H.R.P.Dickson Lieut • Col.

(a) Reference paragraph II of summary Ho. 215 . flight rain fell in Kuwait on 6 th January over a fairly wide area. This was followed by a further remarkable rain fall in the middle of January. A wide depression which from local indications would appear to have formed in South-West Central Arabia moved rapidlym a Horth JSaatarly direotion to the Head of the Persian Gulf and brought copious and heary rain in its track whioh fell oTer a Tery wide area. As far as one can gather the centre of the rain zone consisted roughly of the rectangle bounded by the points Qatif-Buraida-Samawa and Basrah although good rains also fell in other parts of Iraq, Arabistan and Bushire according to reports. As far as Kuwait State was concerned rain fell continuously throughout the 12 th, Ijth, 14th and 15 th January. It was not heavy at any time, but was of the steady soaking kind which does more good than any downpour. i?rom all aides reports continue to come in showing that during these days similar though even stronger rains fell throughout the Hassa, the Summan, Dahana, Batin and Iraq Southern Desert Areas. r In the Town of Kuwait 3 . 11 inches of rain was ^ registered in this short period, which constitutes almost a local record. From the Bedouin point of view this 'Blessing of Uod Lus relieved what promised to he a very serious situation indeed. Sverywhere water is plentiful and innumerable lakelets have formed in many small hollows. Already four days after the event grass has started growing and the famous n ArfaJ n bush has burst into leaf. The full benefits of the rain will of course not be apparent for about another month, but the Spring and Summer promises to be one of great plenty. The Town of Kuwait will also receive its reward in the shape of cheap 'Samman' (Ghi), mutton, wool, sour and fresh milk, all necessities of life, while the present high prices of barley, wheat, flour, etc.etc. should come down with a run. (b)(b) The aboTe rain was followefl by two flays of den.e ( 15 th and l 6 th) whloh oorerefl a wide area and greatly handicapped shipping. The Bastbound air mail managed to reach Kuwait on the 15 th January, but having tried to make Bahrain was forced to r.turn to Kuwait and ohaioah after proceeding 80 miles to the South. The pilot described the fog as of remarkable density 50 mile South of Kuwait. ( 0 ) A pleasing feature was the way the Kuwait aerodrome stood up to the bad weather - The heary aircraft mentioned in (b) above, though it landed and took off twice within two hours on ground which had been steadily rained on for J2 hours and was thoroughly soaked. suffered little inconvenience, the wheels of the machine only sinking a couple of inches or so. This fact should greutl^ encourage pilots of Imperial Airways, Ltd., and ^ x0/e ° k^'&amp;it air port to be a safe one even after the heaviest of rain. II. Tribal . Kuwait Tribes. (Fidawiyah and Araibdar). These have all moved out of the Hazaim area (oouth of the ileutral Tone) and have gone to the Garaa region west o± the 3haqq. They report that another day f s rain would have entailed considerable suffering and even deaths among their camels who were unable to move about and get food. (b) Awazim. A small party of men and camels taking advantage of the rain and fog ran the blockade and arrived in Kuwait from the South on the 15 th January. Though almost dead with cold they replenished their food stocks and got away again on the 17 th. It is hoped that they were successful in evading Bin Saud f s frontier guards. (0)Hothing to report. Nothing to report. (o) Ajaan . (d) fiarb. («) Mutair. A reliable person of this tribe and well known to the writer who left Riyadh on 2 5 th December, reported '• •“* durin S hls oonth's sojourn in Riyadh he had seen muoh of interest in connection with the preparations made for the campaign against Asir. Some of the more intereeting of hia statements are given below:- ( 1 ) Hhalid bin Luwai had proceeded due S 0 uth early in December from Khurna with a force raised from the Western lejd tribes. (-; Ibn *usaad 1 a force which formed the main army had concentrated to the west of Riyadh and moved down the «ady al IXiwasir on approximately 12 th December; this consisted of middle Nejd tribes and ®^oy townsfolk, a. on Musaad had himself come to see the King before marching. (3^ The King himself accompanied by Ibn Ifusaad and 8 large lorries laden with reserve rifles and ammunition which had arrived from Medina after Ibn Musaad 1 a army had marched, followed on 17 th December and caught up the force, and distributed the arms. He returned to Riyadh on 26 th December after mating a series of fiery speeches to hearten the troops and people generally. ( 4 ) The general feeling in and about Riyadh was one of great depression, as, the war was an unpopular one, and the feeling was general that the Imam Yahya of Yemen was behind the Asir rebels, and hencehenc0 the fighting would be of a most desperate character, with no prospect of loot if the Saudi forces were erentually victorious. (5) There no longer existed among the so called 'Akhwan', any of that fanaticism and valour which once had been a feature of this body of men in the early wars of 10 years ago. The n Akhwan' ! movement was definitely an exploded and spent movement, and its members no longer consisted of fanatical Bedouin settled in special '’Colonies’’ founded by the King, but were composed mostly of townsmen and ordinary tribal folk. (6) The King hai given out that neither he nor any member of his family would accompany the expedition to Asir. {]) There appeared to oe great shortage of money in Riyadh, and motor cars were rarely to be seen these days. (8) The expedition started under the worst conditions as regards water and grazing etc. for no rain had fallen to the Southwest of Riyadh. This had resulted in special prayers for rain on 28th and 29th December, These were held outside the City and were led by the King. Strangely enough copious rain fell on the 2nd and 3rd of January. This &amp;f course no doubt would be taken full advantage of by the King as a means of propaganda for heartening the people of Re jd proving that the Almight was on the side of the Saudi Kingdom. Mat lag as Sur one of the most fanatical of the late Faisal al Duwish lieutenants and a man of some culture visitedvisits Kuwait from Baghdad on the 19 th December 1932 and remained as the guest of Hillal al Mutalri (al Diahinii till the 9 th January I 933 . His wife joued him from the Sumaan, whilst he was in Kuwait, k This indiridual is one of the Mutair refugees now residing in Iraq as guest of King Faisal. He appeared to be in very close touch with the liutair tribe generally. The writer had sereral interesting talks with him (see after note at end of last summary). • The Asir itebellion. (a) Situate as Kuwait is at the opposite end of Arabia to ••‘.sir, it is difficult to get really authentic news of events in that province. It ia however pretty well confirmed from Bedouin and other sources in passim that Jezzan and Sabya, were captured by the rebels in the first place and later fell to the Saudi forces. It seemed pretty clear also ( that the rebels are receiving assistance in the forms of arms etc. from ports on the Italian side of the Red Sea. Beyond this, news is vague and unreliable. (b) 'The Shaikh of Kuwait and his people and the Ajman and Mutair tribes in the hinterland more especially, are following events with the greatest interest. The best opinion is that Bin Saud must come off victorious unless Yemen comes in but even if victorious, that the King’s victory will be of a TT Pyrrhio H nature, as it will leave him so crippled financially, that it will be difficult for him to recover at all. ( 0 ) Tribal opinion is that Bln Saud’s lucky star is about to set, and that the Almighty is arranging that he. Bin Saud, should with his own hand pull down 'the e defice uice ' which h© so laboriously built up. (d; The Asir revolt is generally regarded ae due to maladministration on the part of the King, and especially of bis subordinate officials. These everywhere would appear to have got out of hand, with the result that tribal Arabia today cordially detests the King and the Ruling House of al oaud', and is ready to create any trouble it can, if opportunity should occur, (e) On the 11th January one of Bin Saud’s motor car drivers (a Somali) visited Kuwait to see his family who reside in the town. He came by car having taken 2 days to do the journey. Ke brought the news (though he was very averse to talking about it) that a desperate battle had been fought between Bin Saud’s forces and the Asirites and that both sides had lost very heavily. Thw story had a ring of truth about it and would fit in with the date of the arrival of Bin Saud T s army in Asir. (f) The Air mail which arrived in Kuwait on 15 th January brought Egyptian Newspapers notably the Mukattam, which stated that a heavy engagement had been fought in which both ibn Musaad and ibn Luwai had been killed. The news was quoted as having been received from Aden on 2nd January. In a letter dated Riyadh 15 th December (received on 22nd December) to the Shaikh of Kuwait, His Majesty King Abdul Aziz himself writes and gives the following report on the situation:- 'You must have heard of^the question of this traitor, the Idrisi. Truly, this movement is one which is most surprising in this world, that the Idrisi betrays our servants who were to look after his own interests and whom he himself had invited, and it arises from those who had stirred up Ibn Rifada ThanksThanks ba to (Jofl who had disgraced him. ■a sent Khalid Afcu al-Walid and Hamad as-Sulaiman at the head of 300 men in motor oars, who, helped by God recovered Jaizan, after it had been occupied by the Idrisi, and released our servants who had been captured by him. He (the Idrisi) escaped'to^sWaf/ which was also recovered, to the Al-Jlisarah. Most of the people of Tihama were reassured. Khalid hin Luwai with his army of Muslims, has just proceeded. He will reach within two or three days and, by God’s help, all the rebels will be destroyed, God’s accustomed promises are always -;ood. e have also issued our orders to Abdul Aziz bin Musaad, and he has proceeded to Abha with a host of townsmen, Qahtan and Utaibah. This all is for nothing but a prudent policy and the reform of Yaman affairs, as the state of the people allows no negligence now-a-days, and Our lenient and pardoning policy was the cause of all that happened. Muslims are strong by God, and God please, you will shortly get the news that will please you.” IV. Blockade. There is little to record, accept that with the fall of rain on the 6 th January (see under rain) al Bagaawi re-opened the post at Rigai on the Batin (South west corner of Kuwait), which had been withdrawn for lack of water in the summer of 1952 . Al Bagaawi himself is camped with his family in the vicinity of Khabari Wadtha North of Jarriya. The general opinion in Kuwait continues to be as it always has been that nothing will persaude Bin Saud to raise or even ease off the 'Blockade”, except forcible measuresA rather too optimistic attitude to be fully shared by the writer. v - AS^gia-ani -A-i.o.c.Ltd's dispute , ^here is little to report under thi that the strong line so far taken by His iiajesty's Government has had its immediate effect on the people of the Town. The writer in conversation with leaders of opinion has heard the hope everywhere expressed that the British attitude in the matter, will continue to be as firm as it has been, and that there will be no weakening in their policy as a result of clever Persian diplomaoy. VI• ieraiaa Pleat. On the 13th January, a Kuwait merchant of Persian origin received a private letter from Buahire to the effect that the authorities there had issued a public warning to owners of sailing craft, that shortly the ships of the Persian Havy would start regular patrols up and down the Persian Coast, and that any sailing boat which was ordered to lower its sails, and refused, would be sunk out of hand. The above news has been received with mild interest and some ridicule, by the merchant oommunity of Kuwait. I have, etc., (Sgd.) H.H.P, Dickson Lieut.-Col. Political Agent, Kuwait.\ lo. lit.

The lady stated that the King had ordered sot camels to be moved south to Riyadh from hie reserve which grawe permanently In the pasture land about Hafar al Atz (North Northeast of Riyadh in the jahana region). That al Shuwaish his henchman in chargs had eeat/on ?xth November and that Soo more were to follow early in December. According to the lady also, the situation about Ebha where the King’s forces were reported to have been defeated, was looked upon as serious, and the fv'utalr who had none south at the command of the King were full of gloom and had no etomachfor a war so far distant from their homes. (b) The above information was confirmccVby the BhaUch of Kuwait and nis cousin Abdullah as-aalim on 8 th December 1932. Both regard the Aeir rebellion as a much bigger and more serious businessbusiness than that of Ibn Rlf.da. Both are of opinion that the imam of Yemen le behind the trjuole au'i *,■ r.r^retiy assisting aeyed Abdul i&lt;ahab al 1 dr lei the leader of the rebellion. (c) on l?,th December 193 &gt; a Mutalri tribesman arrived from BuraIda. and reported that Hin Baud wae collecting a large force at Riyadh for service in Asir. All the Akhwan had been ordered to ftirnieh contingents including the Bhanmar, Harb, Ataiba (ibn Rabai'an) and many other tribea. Imllarlj the various towns of Mejd were furnishing contingents. on completion of the concentration at 21 yadh ibn Mu'saad u«tremor of , ail was to take command andmarcn to fbha. The coming campaign accor ling to the informer was already very unpopular. General uneasiness prevailed among the Akhwan throughout Nejd and their respond to tne King's call to arms was entirely halfhearted. Their objections to fight could be surwottrized under tnree heads (1) the clstance was too great (2) Even if victorious they would get no camel loot out of the Asir mountaineers(3) They no longer held the belief that if they died fighting for Bin baud, they would attain immediate heavenly bliss. (d) On 15th December 1932 a .Mutairi tribes- man visited Kuwait from A.rtawiyeh. he brought the news that the •Brsih' section of the i. ; utair and other contingents of uie Banl Abdiila, had been ordered to concentrate at Riyadh and that many of them had marched under Ibn l usaiyie. lin- or uiern Mutalr (Muaha) had not Itowever been askedw » Aaxut.rs, as Lne King did not trust them. m. lnformer a , ded that Half i bn Masaid ahalkh of Artawiyeh had bppn ordered to proceed to Riyadh with the Artawlyeh 'Akhwan- but that he had so far refused. £sms ^- ProiB the above, and much oUier desert fcjssip Which continues to filter into Kuwait, it is clear that the coming campaign in Asir which Sin baud is preparing for. on a aomewhat large scale, io entirely unpopular among the Bedouin and people of wejd. andit is likely that if the Riyadh force ever gets as far as Pbha. it will be roughly handled, for *no man's heart is in the business*, according to the Bedouin J 1V * ^M^gdt of the 1 ftfr-y -OHCCeBlon bv News of this event became known in Kuwait almost as soon aslt happened and caused no little stir In the Town. Persian News sheets made their appearance in somewhat mysterious and sudden fashion which gave a highly coloured picture of events. These obviously were sent over from hohsmmerah by Dhow for propaganda purposes. Generally speaking the nh&amp;ikh and nis people are contenting themselves by watching events. The best opinion has it tnat Persia has behaved very badly, and will have to be brought sharply to book by Great Britain, other wise worse tilings will befall. In an interesting conversation which the writerwriter had with shaikh Abdullah Re-aalim. the Filler^ couein, on loth December 1932 , the latter stated that the incident confirmed the almo't universal belief held among Arabs that Great Britain had changed her policy in the east, and preferredto surrender to, rather than face her enemies. That thisllatest incident was entirely due to this weak policy and was the culmination to many other attacke on England's honour. That if thie policy of tils Majesty's overnment waspot changed, disaster would result. England must learn to differentiate between 'astern peoples' mentality and that of westerners. Among the latter there existed a code of honour not known in the East. Arabs had a useful proverb which read -if an Arab asks for your coat in the desert, beware lest you give it him, ror if you do he will also take your shirt and trousers, knowing that he hath nothing further to fear from you'. He suggested that we English must not expect too much sympathy in the A.p. o. C. business, seeing thst|Hls Majesty's Government herself had rather got into the habit of 'breaking f^lth with friends, especially week ones who could not make their voice heard in the world's councils. The shaikh referred of course of His Majesty's hitherto failure to settle the two most pressing and urgent problems of Kuwait, the Blockade and the Date Gardens question. Behind his parable also wa^hie belief that if His Majesty's/' i \ i Majesty's Governnmt took a strong line with i'ersia, there would be a general renewal of confidence all round, and in Arabia in particular.

Mrs. Dickson wno arrived back from London on 7 th October reported having met in London on 21st September. The latter in the course of a discussion of the Kuwait Blockade made the interesting statement that it was quite absurd to tMnk tlurt the King would in anyway agree to a modification of the blockade. Bin sand, he said, would only change his attitude and allow Kuwait to trade Wit ' n tne iu '' f ' ri0r on two conditions namely (a) If Kuwait agreed to come under his suzerainty (b) if she allowed a Nejd Customs Officer to sit in the Kuwait Customs nouse and take a snare of the customs receipts for his master, wnicn he added would be tantamount to Kuwait coming under Bin Baud's control. The King's attitude In the matter, added Mr.philby was a right and natural one, and questions of sentiment or what Kuwait nad done in the fcast'' for the King, would never be allowed to count for anything where the King's ambition was concerned. This ambition ever lay in tne possession of tne port of Kuwait. Mr. phllby scorned ’ rs.Dickson's suggestion that the obvious way out of the difficulty was for Bin gaud to place a Reveime Officer on the border and collect taxes from outgoing caravans and Bedouin at the natural line of wells, Hefar,Bafa,wabra,Jerriya and 'Nta, as he said this would be too expensive and not in accordance with his policy, yrs.Dickson replied that already Bin Baud spent much money in maintaining Blockade parties as it was, and that if these were reduced somewnat and replaced by Customs posts, much less expenditure would be Incurred. Mr.Philby's only reply was that such ciourse was quite impossible. He added that though thetue King's linances were tiad at present, a good pilgrim ,&gt;m hub t r \; rf- soon, and when this happened the King's first - iteriuion was to develop a port on the fiassa Coast* i1932 .

'oth t&gt;er?on8 are personally known to the writer. T he two ord cars which used to be employed by Ibn Khraimis ^or natrol purposes along the border, are no longer in u**, being comolete wrecks arid lying at Jarriya. Al Bagaawi has a special body of men to assist him which he brought from tr offuf. They number 40 and are scattered in oarties of 5 or 6 at each at the various fumman watering olaces. Ibn Shajaan has some 15 men at Hafar, It is confir^«d that the blockade has at any rate r i r or the present, been taken out of the hands of the Amir Saud, au .4 been transferred to Abdulla ibn Jaloui the Amir of Haesa. According to a reliable agent who arrived in Kuwait from Riadb on 12th September 1932 (he left hi&amp;dh on Augusts the commonly believed story at the capital ae to th« reason why al D agaawi relieved ibn Khraimis, is that it was all due to ohorned al Tawils’ (Revenue Officer of ,7 assa^ complaints to the King, it was said that the latto had guaranteed that Hassa would produce 11 lacs of Revenue but that this was tailing very far ^iort of expectations. To save himself # he had cof?i y lained of the big “dump'* of contraband goods recently foun] at ^ta, arid had reported that qnch more besides was re&gt;mlarly being smuggled out of Kuwait, intoin'o in had intimatnd that he could not be reeroneible for further collection of revenue, unless th« r'ing out ihn Taloui in charge of Kuwait blockade operations. a much more aevere policy wae instituted on the Kuwait frontier. ''here would appear to be some truth in the al eve story, and it ia more than likely that the new policy has been introduced at the instance of Al Tawil merely to save his own skin. In the writer’s ooinion very little ever got out of Kuwait in ibn Khraimis’ time, md there were no signs at all that rlockade running was on the increase. C’n the contrary all evidence tends to show that the lockade was never so effective as during the last year. IV.

That this worthy has been defeated and killed is now generally believed, but the failure of the harb war party under ibn %hait to return home is looked upon as significant• A Bedouin 15 days from the adi Sir haft k&gt;rth- est of Janf reported on the 7 th September that while ibn Hifada was certainly killed and his force defeated, the remnants of the latter had taken refuge in the mountains near the scene of the battle and were for the present holding out there. In his opinion they must soon surrender however, if they had not done so already. He confirmed that Ibn ? ugaiya 2nd in command of the rebels had not been filled. Comuent. The ibn Hifada affairs lias caused a very deep stir ail over the Torth-Eastern corner of Arabia, and every one was in high hopes that he would have none something. Bedouin like however, no one was prepared to risk a move until that something happened. His defeat and death will no doubt discourage those tribes and individuals who bear Bin Baud ill will, and they ljtq very many t^day . but it will not quench their spirit, or drive them to despair. On the contrary, their hatred for their master will grow more intense, and they will continue to live for the day of revenge. These remarks especially refer to the Breat Mutair and Ajman tribes. A curious thing about this ibn Hifada business has been and still is the almost universal belief in the Bedouinsmind that the British were affording him support, and nothing will persuade ones Bedouin friends to believe that Captain Olubb was not the prime mover in the play. IV.IV. ifeisfil al (jQYflrj.Qr There were several rumours during* the latter part of August to the effect that the Amir Faisal on his return from Kuwait had replaced his brother 3aud as Cxovernor of xiiadh and that the latter had been recalled to Taif, but there would appear to be no truth in the story, accor.iin^ to i merchant traveller who has just arrived from aif via xiiadh and Jahrain, the Amir Faisal is back at Taif and has resumed his duties there. This has also been partially confirmed by letters from 'Al Tawil' who also lias returned from &amp;ecca to Hassa. Incidentally the former person reported that the iiassa revenue was already 1/3 short of what was anticipated but no doubt lahrain will get full news about this. About the 25 th of August $in .laud^ ?d&gt;rth-;ast ^ frontier official ibn Khraimis was suddenly recalled and l replaced by the infamous and cruel liamud al 3agaawi. The new arrival is a worthy of very unsavoury reputation and known in Kuwait as the butcher ” of Abdullah bin Jaloui, (jovernor of Hassa. His taking over charge of the 31 ockade operations appears to be connected in some way or other with the presentation by His Majesty's Minister in Jedda of Kuwait's claims, and the letter proposing that the long promised Commission be appointed to deal with the Blockade. Suffice to say that ibn Bagaawi has given out far and wide that his master the King, having noticed that there was a falling off in the way of the Blockade was maintained, had made ibn Jaloui responsible for the Nejd - Kuwait frontier policy, and had appointed him to tighten up the Blockade as it had never be-n tightened up before. ItIt certainly would appear that al laf^aawi'a arrival on the soeno ia no mere coincidence, and it is not in the least unlikely that din 3aud, feeling annoyed at the action of his Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, should have straightway desired to vent his spleen on Kuwait and so otdered a more severe policy to be introduced on the Kuwait frontier. .'his would fit in well with Bin baud's well known metnods. ihe diaikii ol Kuwait is naturally not a little anxious at the turn of ev nts and also believes that something has happened to cause him to be the object of the : inT 1 ' .Tath once again f seeing that not a v?ord (letter or telegram) has beon received from Bin .Baud telling him of ibn Hifada's defeat or anything else. Bin Baud would normally never area® oi omitting to send him joyous news of such a nature. That al Bag&amp;awi 1 s arrival means harsh and further cruel treatment 01 the tribes* and possibly incursions across the frontier into Kuwait goes without saying, he is the man chiefly responsible for all the raids and killings that took place in Kuwait territory between seven and nine years ago* and the cause incidentally of many now of the claims which have/been preferred by His Majesty’s Minister. It will be interesting to see developments.J S' (a) Reference paragraph 16 (d) of 1934.- Mrs. Mallet left by Imperial Airways for Bahrain en route for Bush ire on the 1st March 1934.

Satisfactory progress in the sale of the ordina shares of the Kuwait Electric Supply Company, Limited, was reported during the past few weeks. Fifteen hundred shares of one Dinar each were sold in one day (Sunday the 17th December 1933). Further sales appear to have ( then ceased owing to a disagreement between the Managers and the local shareholders. It is said that the Managers of the concern favour keeping the office of the Company at Basra and from thdre to control the working of the com pany; but Kuwait shareholders insist, and I think rather naturally, that the office should be located at Kuwait. This, they say, will enable them to find out at any time where they stand. No decision seems to have been arrived at yet. (c) The Kuwait Municipality have taken fifty lights for the main bazaars, which former started functioning re gularly every night from the 17th December 1933.

Town bazaars are once more full of people after a spell of inactivity occasioned by the de parture to banks, four months ago, of the diving population. The catch, it is said, has this year, been much superior to that of the last year both in respect of quality as well as quantity. But 4e owing to the market for pearls being still dull, the richness of the catch has not resulted in a corresponding prosperity to the diver. A characteristic feature of this year's pearl fishing has been the surprisingly even division of pearls caught by the various boats, unlike last year when a few prominent boats had all the luck, while the majority came home empty. 'in Kusa'ad Badr, a prominent Kuwait merchant is reported to have sold a pearl for He.20 ,000. The sale took place on the banks.
