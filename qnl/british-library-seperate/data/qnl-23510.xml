He also regrets that there was no news relating to the blockade of Katiffe [Al-Qaṭīf], but as it was supposed that Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Ephraim Gerrish Stannus was already in the Gulf, he was doubtless carrying orders that would 'speedily bring Rahma's business to a determination'.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024055009.0x000036#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
