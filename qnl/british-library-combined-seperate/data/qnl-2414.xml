An additional mixed foliation/pagination sequence is present in parallel between ff 2-94; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled.Two previous foliation sequences, which are also circled, have been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file comprises: 1) copies of extracts, or complete copies of, Persian Gulf Trade War Bureau reports, numbered 29 to 37, and issued weekly and dated between 15 August 1942 and 2 November 1942; 2) copies of correspondence concerning the re-export trade from the Arab Coast, chiefly from Dubai to Persia [Iran] and other countries.The Persian Gulf Trade War Bureau reports are arranged by country (Persia, Iraq, Bahrain, Kuwait, Dubai) and by subject or commodity (sugar, tea, cotton, etc.). They contain extracts and intelligence gleaned from intercepted mail and telegraphic correspondence, chiefly from merchants but also from newspapers and other organisations, and report on a range of subject matter related to trade, including: suspected or known cases of smuggling, fictitious orders used to increase quotas, and the re-export trade from Dubai. Some of the reports contain intelligence relating to wartime developments in Europe, which is struck through in red or blue pencil. The final report in the file (ff 76-87) contains statistical tables showing trade in various commodities between India and the key ports of the Persian Gulf.Correspondence related to the re-export trade from Dubai chiefly takes place between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel William Rupert Hay; Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Geoffrey Prior), the Political Agent at Bahrain (Edward Birkbeck Wakefield), and the Residency Agent at Sharjah (Khan Sahib Saiyid ‘Abd al-Razzaq), and discusses the reasons behind the flourishing re-export trade from Dubai, methods of limiting the re-export trade, stock levels of sugar in the Gulf.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Interception of communication</topic></subject><subject><topic>Market intelligence</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Dubai</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Smuggling</topic></subject><subject><topic>Trade (practice)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000085#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000085#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000085#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000085#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
