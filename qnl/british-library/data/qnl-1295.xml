The reception of Mr. Rassam by king Theodore, and the release of the British consul and missionaries who have for two years suffered imprisonment attended with terrible hardships, is satisfactory, though the means taken to effect the object are as little flattering to our national prestige as the Bhoo- tan business has been. The fear of war between North and South Germany, which V. is so imminent, is not likely to be real ized. The mioor States seem determined feot- to aRp'^t Prussia which has so seriously wounded their self-love ; Austria is destitute of funds and the materiel of war while the Hungarian difficulty is not yet quite settled ; and the Dnke of Saxe Coburg has taken the place of mediator. The Reform Bill, in 'spite of the non-disfranchisement of the smaller boroughs, has been received in England with that favour which we expected. The second reading which will decide its fate will not take place before the 30th instant. The Fenian danger has for the time been met in Ireland by Lord Wodehouse's vigorous counsels and measures, so that, when reform has been settled, Parliament may have leisure to consider those changes in the position of the established church, and those concessions to the advocates of tenant-right and a purely secular system of education, which the peculiar genius of jthe people demand, on the same principle that Scotland enjoys its national institu tions. The despatch of a squadron to the coast of Canada will give confidence to Lord Monck in meeting the threatened attacks of the Fenians there. O i - i Saturday the Bengal Council, having dul} legislated for palkeewallas and against hackery wallas, will receive the report of its Select Committee on the Hooghly Trust Bill. It seems impossible that the mea sure should pass into law in any form this ses sion. It would be fruitless for us to discuss the Bill which the Advocate General described as purely tentative. One point alone, at pre sent, demands an expression of public opin ion.,, The Council seem determined to make the Tnist a mere branch of the Municipal department, as the drainage and water works are. The original Bill proposed that four of the ten Trustees shall be merchants or shipowners on the spot. But even this insufficient representation of the mercantile and shipping interests has been withdrawn in the amended Bill, which proposes to vest the Trust in a committee of ten Justices of the Peace. Of course the two merchants who are members of the Council refused to agree to such a proposal, as will be found from the report of the Select Committee elsewhere. But this is not all. The Chair man of the Trust, or ' Committee' as it is pro posed to term it, in whom alone by the 26th section the members may vest 'all their powers,' is to be the already overwork ed Chairman of the Justices, A despot is wanted in each capacity, for the river and for the city, and it is difficult to say which needs his energetic and skilled action the more. But to give both classes of duties to one man is to secure his failure in discharg ing either satisfactorily. Let the merchants see to it. The Trust ought to be their affair mainly, with one or two Justices to re present the interests of the city. The Chair man of the Trust ought to be a first class hydraulic engineer with no other duties, assisted by a good busineFg man as deputy. If the port could secure Mr. Leonard C. E. at any price and give him carte blanche it would be fortunate. The local legislature / should pledge the port in this Bill to noth ing more than temporary establishments un der these two officers, leaving any wider executive machinery to be provided for per manently after a year's experience. What ever is proposed the Chamber of Commerce should look to the wide and almost imperial interests of the whole trade of the Gangetic valley and Assam, and not allow a purely local and necessarily selfish municipal body, which is unequal to its own proper duties, to sacrifice a gigantic work to petty local considerations. A singular misapprehension as to the treat merit of the cash balances by Sir Charles Wood in the current year has been caused in most of the provincial papers by our Calcutta contemporaries' incorrect reports of the financial statement. We see Mr. Massey denounced for allowing Sir Charles Wood to draw £800,000 more than he ought to have done in the year about to expire, and so causing the deficit. This is the opposite of what Mr. Massey said and we reported. Sir Charles Wood drew that sum less, and sold stock in England to meet his requirements to the full as estimated. In fact be undid Sir Charles Trevelyan's hasty conversion of the surplus cash balan ces into capital which we condemned at the time, and which reduced the balances so low as to imperil the solvency of Govern ment last December. The resale of £800,000 of capital, combined with the large earnings of the railways, has restored stability to the balances, raising them to the estimated level of- £121 millions at the close of this month. It now only remains for Mr. Massey [ to sell stock to strengthen the currency 3 S brings reserve before next cold season iound the annual crisis, unless the recom mendations of the Currency Commission as to legalising gold and removing the cir cles are immediately carried out by the Home authorities. Meanwhile that Commis sion persists in what we must gravely term its silly refusal to publish the evi dence, and the issue of its Report is de layed by the flight mend to the study these words of the teres ting review of by Baron James de Superior Council of charged to Simla. We corn- of Sir W. Mansfield Economist, in its iu- the evidence given Rothschild before the Commerce in France, with the inquiry into ' the Princi ples and General Facts which regula.te Monetary and Paper Circulation.' That Council, w r e are told, ' has committed the grave error of not publishing day by day a detailed report of the evidence given before it, albeit the ostensible object of its mission was to enlighten the commercial public on those matters, respecting which considerable ignorance prevails.' So the Economist has been forced to obtain the evidence by other means. Yet Sir W. Mansfield has more than once paraded his desire for immediate if not full publicity even in political ques tions like that of Bhootan. W e are glad to state that the increase of salaries proposed by Mr. Cust for the Punjab, the Oudh, and the Jhansi Civil Lists are sanc tioned, being an additional grant of about one lakh per annum, while all the proposed reduc tions of the Agra and Bengal Civil Lists are disallowed with the following exceptions—• The Commissioners of Opium are both re duced ; the Sudder Boards of Revenue, Bengal and North West are both reduced. Mr. Cust's own salary is reduced £300 a year which is the best proof of his -being actuated in this matter solely by a regard for the public in terests. Gun Military Correspondent's letter con- ■ains hopeful news for Indian Officers. M r. J ohn D ickinson is at it again. In spite of his own confession as to the recep- • on of one ' testimonial' and the expecta- tinn of another for agitating about Dhar, in a petition which he caused to be presented to Parliament for the right of adoption by the Mysore Rajah, he describes himself as ' a person who has for many years devoted himself gratuitously to the task of promot ing the interests of the people of India in connection with those of his own country men ; and that, on various occasions, he has proved to be possessed of better inform ation and sounder views of policy than the executive authorities in India.' The impertinence of the petition is paralleled onty by the grossnesH of its misrepresenta tions. The same unscrupulous agency in Cen tral India which took up the Dhar case is now managing that of Mysore. The oriental mode of payment is not beforehand but by ' testimonials' dependent on success—testi monials wrung, as ;n that case, from the un willing chief and his oppressed tenantry. iisiiisr</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100023431847.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>Mss Eur F126/66, f 1</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023431847.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>Mss Eur F126/66, f 1</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Page from
