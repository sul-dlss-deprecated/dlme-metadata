( y —i k \ cCoes/i o«/yt- This enclosure caught my eye in the 'Civil and Military Gazette' of the 17th May 1939. I do not know how much 100,000 Straits dollars works out in sterling, but the idea struck me whether the Shaikh might not like to follow Kelantan*6 example and either donate (a) a sum of a few thousand pounds for Imperial Defence, or (b) better still present something useful to His Majesty's Government in connection with the Defence of Bahrain, say a speed-launch to the Royal Air Force flight who are to be stationed in Bahrain, the launch to be called after him. and to be based on Bahrain. 2. In either case the money should come from the Shaikh's private purse, and not from the Bahrain State, which is already purchasing the Bren , or other guns, for defence. There is of course no call on the Shaikh to do anything of this sort, but as he and his family are \^ now drawing a very large income (vide paragraph 6(d)(2) G I \r \\ \ of my letter No.347-S of the 14th April 1939, I daresay the idea might appeal to him. It would not be the actual amount of the donation, or the value of the gift that would matter, but the gesture. We would see that he the ? • ^ i t V u* V Political Agent, Bahrain . * * if * u ^*• » - 2 - c the Shaikh-got considerable reclam e out of the gesture, and it would have an excellent political effect in the Gulf, and outside it. 3.
