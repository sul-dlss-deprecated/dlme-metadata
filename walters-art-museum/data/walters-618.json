Although made for Christian liturgical use, the piece is ornamented in an Islamic style and has an illegible Arabic inscription on the lid. Sicily fell under Arab rule in 902, and many Islamic craftsmen continued to work there after the Norman conquest of 1072. Following a rebellion in 1221, most Sicilian Muslims were expelled to North Africa.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/39842", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date of acquisition unknown], by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-25T01:00:01.08", "Creator": "Islamic", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL2_54.517_Fnt_NF_C39.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL2_54.517_Fnt_NF_C39.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL2_54.517_Fnt_NF_C39.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL2_54.517_Fnt_NF_C39.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL2_54.517_Fnt_NF_C39.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1434156, 1436305", "ExhibIDs": "1957", "Images": "PL2_54.517_Fnt_NF_C39.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
