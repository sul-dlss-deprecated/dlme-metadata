WITH reference to my despatch N o. 5 1 of the 10th February respecting conditions in Luristan, I have the honour to inform you that according to reports received from His Majesty’s consul at Aliwaz the situation has greatly improved during the last three months. 2. Sepahbud (Marshal) Ahmed Agha Khan left Pul-i-Dukhtar in February in order to attack Yadullah Khan in the mountains, having the assistance on this occasion of a force of Kurds from Pusht-i-Kuh. He had previously sent two Saiyids with a Koran to Yadullah to persuade him to make peace with the Government, but he had declined the terms offered him. In the following month the Sepahbud inflicted a defeat on Yadullah’s forces, but Yadullah himself escaped. 3. The latest news is to the effect that Yadullah has at last accepted the Government’s terms. He stayed for some days with the Sepahbud at Khorremabad in April and is even said to have left subsequently for Tehran. In the meantime the former outlaws have been given land by the Sepahbud along both sides of the Khorremabad road, including, it is said, the property known as Waisian, near Khorremabad, which belonged to the late Nizam-us- Sultaneh. They are at present living in their black tents, but are busy building houses. The Revenue Department is supplying grain and money for their food and other requirements. 4. The condition of the Khorremabad road is reported to be good and safe. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 36), His Majesty’s consul, Ahwaz (No. 43) and to the acting British consul at Kermanshah (No. 12). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE.10. Luristan. It is reported that Yadullah Khan has been defeated by the Government troops operating against him, several Lurs being killed or captured; but Yadullah Khan appears to have succeeded in evading his pursuers and to have escaped to the mountains with a few of his followers. Further attempts are being made to capture him.No, 153, British Legation, Tehran# &lt;d; 1 6th A 4 ril, 1935. 2B APR ! p.z. Sir, ° 'X, ; V /. '-f- JW .'

You will observe that the ransom of twenty thousand Tomans, which was not needed in the end, was provided by Kirs. Carroll, and that the section of Lure responsible for the outrage were distinct from that which has been giving most of the recent trouble. The Persian authorities appear to have acted energetically and intelligently. 3. I have given a copy of the first despatch, but not of the second, to my American colleague. The Persian Government, I may say, did not choose to tell him that the kidnapping had taken place and, when he took the Initiative and asked for particulars, were singularly uncommunicative. Mr. Hart said at the time that though he and Mr. Carroll were on good terms personally, he was quite sure that the American engineers generally would not inform him of the occurrence if they could possibly help it. He ascribed this to the fact that the American Legation, owing to their preoccupation with the affairs of the Ulen Company, was bound to adopt an attitude at /variance * The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign office.- 2 - variance with the personal interests of the American engineers: the latter knew this and were unwilling to admit to anything that suggested that the construction of the railway was not the simple task they pretended* 4* I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (Mo. 66), to His Majesty's Ambassador at Baghdad (Mo. 27) and to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz (Mo. 22).

BRITISH CONSULATE, AfiWA2. 16th ;Jaroh f 1933. Sir, With reference to my telegram *Jo. 4 of March 8, reporting the capture by brigands of the Director General of the South Persian Railways and to your telegram Ho. 6 of the 10th instant, I hare the honour to submit the following aeeount of the occurrence. 2. On March 7 Ur, Carroll accompanied by Mr. Irian, an American engineer, and by his personal serrant and a motor driver, was on one of his periodical tours of inspection at the northern end of the railway line. He was returning towards two o’clock in the afternoon by the road which has been constructed along-side the recently finished railway embankment between the Dam Dam mountain and Salehabad. At a point about twenty four miles north of the latter place they were fired upon by a party of Lure some twelve in number who stopped the oar and demanded the money box, under the impression that they had caught the paymaster. The windscreen was broken but none of the party was hit. After some parley, during which r. Carroll at the outlet apparently almost persuaded his assailants to let him go, the party was marched away into the mountains and arrived by successive stages at a point some twenty off miles fro® the scene of their capture. From there the driver was sent back with proposals for a ransom of two hundred thousand rials. 3. Though this part of the country is desolate and known to be liable to the attentions of marauding /tribesmentribesmen it has apparently not been the custom of the engineers on construction work to take an escort* Thitherto there had been no interference with their movements, though a railway camp was attacked not very long ago and a Persian merchant was carried off and a contractor seriously wounded. The Khoremabad road, where there are gendarmerie posts, diverges from the railway to the north of Salehabad, and runs roughly parallel through the ham Da® district at a distance of about ten miles from the track of the railway. Telephone communication, however, exists with Salehabad and Ahwaz. 4. Mr. Carroll^ wife was awaiting her husband at Salehabad, where the Railway Administration now has its own bungalows. She raised the alarm when he had not returned by midnight and a search party was sent out. At 4.0 a.m. news was received that the wrecked car had been found. The railway authorities in Ahwaz were at once advised and several members of the Persian staff and Americas engineers went up to Salehabad in the early morning, while the military and civil authorities were roused and informed. The Governor General was laid up at the time with influenza. The troops at Bizful were instructed to stand by and instructions were sought from Tehran by the officer in Command of the troops in Luristan, who in the meanwhile despatched two hundred cavalry to the neighbourhood. The Sepah Bud who was at pul-i-Sal at the time negotiating with Yadull&amp;h Kahn, was also notified. 5. For twenty four hours there was no news of the captives nor of the direction taken by their captors, until the driver returned with a demand for ransom accompanied by the Persian merchant referred to previously and a Lur, who gave himself up to the military authorities. Mrs. Carroll, apparently on her own initiative, made immediate arrangementsr' - 3 to give a personal guarantee for the sum demanded, and the money waa obtained in silver from the National Bank of Persia at Bizfnl. Sac lea containing two rial pieces to the value of two hundred thousand rials were loaded on two cars which left in charge of a senior member of the American staii along with all the available donkeys of the district* The money was taken a considerable distance up into the mountains under military escort until met by a second messenger bearing further proposals from the Lurs* Meanwhile the Sepah Bud had received the plainest instructions from Tehran holding him personally responsible for the safety and rescue of Mr* Carroll and he proceeded to Salehabad with more troops and advanced towards Bam Dam. The Governor General also found it prudent to leave his bed of sickness and go to Salehabad to await events* 7 # The second message from the Lurs intimated that no ransom would be demanded but that, as the prxc^* ot Mr* Carroll’s release, their own security must be guaranteed by the Central Government. Certain members of the tribe must be given employment on the Persian Railway, and lands must be distributed for cultivation. The messenger also bore a private note from Mr* Carroll urging that the troops should be called off, as, otherwise, his life was certainly in danger* 8 # Mrs. Carroll, on seeing this note, sent a personal telegram to the shah begging him to stop the advance of the troops. His Majesty replied most courteously expressing sympathy and stating that her husband's desires would be complied with. Apparently the necessary instructions were given, and the Lurs kept their word, tor Mr* Carroll and Mr* Irian, together with their servant and accompanied by their captors and several local Khans /returned_ 4 - returned to Salehabad on tiie evening of March 11, the Sepah j^ud having given a written undertaking that this tribe would not be molested and that their claims would be considered. Mr. Carroll also promised to support their request. Before they set out on the return journey the liurs handed back their watches and rings to the Americans. On arrival at Salehabad the tribesmen were deprived of their rifles and were then allowed to return to Dam Dam. T#hile in dalehabad the Khans requested the Sepah Bud to exercise similar clemency towards certain *o^en- folk and relatives of Yadullah Khan whom he at present holds in his hands. Xt is stated her© that the tribe which captured Mr. Carroll is entirely unconnected with the operations of Yadullah Khan and that the event was quite fortuitous and unpremeditated. 10 . Apart from the fatigue consequent on long forced marches over exceedingly rough country, Mr. Carroll appears to be none the worse for his experience. He was treated with consideration by his captors who gave hi® such food as they were able to obtain. I am told that tnis is his third experience of capture by brigands. H # it seems probable that a sufficient display of force was made on this occasion to deter the tribes in the neighbourhood of the railway from any attempt at repeating such attacks. But despite the continued statements in the Tehran press and elsewhere it can hardly be claimed yet tnat complete security reigns throughout the length and breadth of the land. No recent reports have been received of any hold up on the Khoremabad road, but tne pillaging of villages continues. 12 ^ The reports of floods and a bad washout on the railway to which reference is made in your telegram No. 6 of 10th March 1933 refer to events which happened several /weeksThe damage weekg before the capture of Mr. Carroll, caused then was repaired immediately, as reported in para« graph 19 of the diary for denary 1935.

The figure of 3,500 men, given in paragraph 2, is a much larger number than 1 had previously imagined the Lur rebels could raise. 2 It is clear that Yadullah Khan is in a position to do a great deal oi damage, but it is at the same time doubtful whether he has the resources necessary to organise his somewhat mixed following to the point of being able to the military forces indefinitely. The terms which he is said tohaveoifered tothe Government are that he should be Governor of Luristan at a salary of 50,000 rials a month, and that all troops should be withdrawn from the province, no garrison being maintained there in future.

Tehran, December 31, 1932. Report on Campaign undertaken against Lur Tribesmen. (Secret.) AN autumn campaign was undertaken against the Lur tribesmen. It has been a matter of some conjecture why the Government has not previously dealt with this outbreak. The official policy for some time past has been to deport the Lurs to settlements in other parts of Persia. When villages and nomadic camps were rounded up by troops, it was to be expected that women and children were chiefly collected, and in this manner large parties of Lur tribesmen were made homeless and desperate by the loss of their families and outlawed by the action of the Government. These have been successfully raiding for some months past, and have collected a large quantity of grain, cloth and stores from lorries which have been regularly looted on the Dizful-Khurramabad-Burujird road. Two incidents of special importance were the kidnapping of a party of officials, including the Governor of Khurramabad, in July and the holding up of a large number of motor vehicles on the Hamadan-Kermanshah road on the 3rd September, when three American consular representatives were temporarily captured by the tribesmen. It is said on good authority that a colonel, who was abducted with the Governor of Khurramabad, was subsequently shot in Tehran by direct order of the Shah for displaying cowardice on that occasion. The autumn campaign consisted of an enveloping movement. The Kermanshah Regiment and the Muzaffar Infantry Regiment, the latter from the Kurdistan Brigade, with headquarters at Senneh, were employed to the north and west. A strong detachment from Tehran, consisting of the Bahadur Regi ment (3rd Regiment, 1st Brigade) and four squadrons of cavalry, one from each regiment of the Central Garrison, was sent to reinforce the permanent troops in the area, namely, the Luristan Brigade, whose headquarters are at Khurramabad. The commander of this brigade, Sarhang Mehdi Quli Khan, Baksh, was superseded, and Sarhang Haji Ali Khan, Razm Ara, commanding the Kerman shah Regiment, was appointed to succeed him. A detachment from Isfahan is also said to have taken part in the operations. The total number of troops employed was approximately 7,000, under the command of Sartip Murteza Khan and Sipah Bod (marshal). Ahmed Agha Khan w^as in chief control, civil and military, of the whole area. Certain sources state that as many as thirteen aircraft are being employed based on Khurramabad, and that two or three of these have come to grief. These figures are, however, probably an exaggeration, but five or six aircraft are certainly at Khurramabad in connexion with these operations and one or two at Ahwaz. Enclosure in No. 1. [691 r—5]2 It is difficult to estimate the number of the rebels, but they may have been up to 3,000, under the leadership of Yadullah Khan, Bairanwand, whose father, Ghulam Ali Khan, had been publicly executed in Khurramabad. The rebels consist very largely of the Bairanwand section, whilst the important Saigawand are more or less neutral. The Kakawand appear to be on the side of the Government, and have, to some extent, been armed in order that they may assist the regular troops on occasion. The Lurs have with them a senior ex-officer, Sarhang Gigu. This man, some two years ago, was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for opium smuggling at Hamadan, but escaped from the Qasr Kajar prison and managed to reach Luristan. The tribesmen were very short of arms and ammunition at the commencement of the operations, but are reported to have collected sufficient for their present needs from the conscript soldiers who show no desire to fight and freely surrender their arms and equipment. The following is an extract from a report received from Kermanshah : — “A half-company (of the Kermanshah Regiment), led by Captain Shahpur Khan, a promising young officer, was ambushed at Tang-i-Shir and suffered serious casualties. The men, all recruits of four months’ service, threw down their arms after their officers had been killed and were allowed to go, on showing that they were conscripts. The Lurs made off with all the arms and ammunition, including a machine gun. The losses of the military are estimated at twenty-four—forty men. A few wounded reached the Kermanshah hospital.' The success of the revolt in Luristan has had some effect on neighbouring tribes, and it is reported from both Kermanshah and Ahwaz that crime is on the increase, and local tribesmen and bad characters are committing raids and .robberies which are credited to the Lurs. Sartip Murteza Khan has now returned to Tehran and been given command of the following troops, which he has orders to equip and prepare as an expeditionary force presumably to be used as reinforcements against the Lurs. All sources agree that the creation of this force has no connexion with the Anglo- Persian Oil Company affair :— Two regiments of infantry (6 battalions). One regiment of cavalry. Two batteries of artillery. These troops were still in Tehran on the 31st December. P. C. R. DODD, Lieut.-Colonel, Military Attache.
