The latter subsidy is referred to as initially having been granted to Sultan Faisal bin Turki [Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Bū Sa‘īd] as a personal subsidy in 1912, in recognition of his co-operation in the suppression of arms traffic in the Persian Gulf. The Zanzibar subsidy is described as being the right of any Sultan recognised by the British Government, 'subject to their fulfilling certain conditions.'The date range of the volume is 1921-1939; however, there is no material dating from 1924-1931. The correspondence dating from 1921 to 1923 (ff 2-40) notes the continuation of the arms traffic subsidy following the death of Sultan Faisal bin Turki, owing to certain exceptional circumstances, and discusses whether it should be reduced or withdrawn when his successor, Sultan Taimur bin Faisal [Taymūr bin Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Bū Sa‘īd] ceases to rule. The question is raised again in 1932, following the abdication of Sultan Taimur bin Faisal and the accession of his son, Saiyid Said bin Taimur [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd], and this later correspondence discusses the extension of the subsidy and its eventual discontinuation in January 1936. Also discussed are changes to the arrangements for the payment of the Zanzibar subsidy.The volume features the following principal correspondents: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Government of India's Foreign Secretary; the Viceroy of India; the Sultan of Muscat and Oman; officials of the India Office and the Government of India's Foreign and Political Department.The Arabic language material mostly consists of correspondence exchanged between British representatives and the Sultan of Muscat, of which English translations are also present.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Bū Sa'īd</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman Āl Wasik Billah al-Majid Taymūr bin Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Sa'īd</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman Sa'īd ibn Taymūr Āl Bū Sa'īd</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Sultanate of Muscat and Oman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Finance</topic></subject><subject><topic>Subsidies</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arms traffic</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000383#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000383#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
