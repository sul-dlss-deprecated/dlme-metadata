Political Department. From, The Commissioner in Sind. To, The Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind. Commissioner's Office, Kurrachee, 22nd August 1870. Sir, In acknowledging the receipt of your letter No. 1127, of the 4th instant, with accompaniraents, 1 have the honor to inform you that the maintenance of cordial relations with the Punjaub border Officers was a most necessary point to be observed, and the correspondence on record shows that you have most carefully, and fully adhered to the instructions issued by Government in that respect. But while carrying out those instructions, the greatest care should have been taken that no acts of those Officers should affect in any way the interests of the Khelat Government, which are especially and solely in your charge, as the channel of communication between the British Go vernment and that of Khelat ; and that no dealings by those Officers with the subjects of Khelat, which might in any way affect the interests of that State, or chance to be distasteful to His Highness the Khan, should be allow- ed by you. Further that, if any of the Punjaub Officers wished to visit that portion of the Khan's dominions adjacent to their border, it was manifestly necessary that His Highness should first be informed thereof of the object of their going, and his sanction obtained. The ' dissatisfaction' and ' feel ings of irritation' on His Highness' part, clearly point to this omission as their cause. 2. I cannot agree with you that any of the recent proceedings at Khelat show ' a very unbecoming and dangerous sort of agitation,' either on the part of the Khan, or the British Agent at his Court, but, on the contrarv, that what has occurred, has followed from the omission—accidental I conclude— on your part, of a very obvious act of courtesy towards the Khan, one which had on all previous occasions been observed. 3. I fail also to observe anything in the 4th to 7th paras, of Captain Harrison s very interesting, and straightforward report, that can be reckoned an attack on His Highness the Ameer of Cabul. Captain Harrison merely sets forth his reasons lor giving the reply he made to the Khan, when ques tioned as to the reported action of His Highness the Ameer, in regard to his, the Khan s, rebellious Sirdars, who had gone to Cubul.4. There is notKing either in the circumstances detailed in that part of Captain Harrison's Diary, from the 4th to the 10th of July last, referred to by you, to cause any alarm, or give any reason to suspect, that His Highness the Khan is disposed to act in antagonism to His Highness the Ameer. The Khan has a perfect right to cause letters to be sent to Ibrahim Khan, or any one else in Seistan, and in this instance, was doing so, with a view to obtain good information of what was passing in that country, a thing which has lately been particularly asked for by Government. The statement by Ibrahim Khan that he, as a Belooch, was really a subject of Khelat, and his application for assistance, means nothing further than that he is in dire straits, and anxious for assistance from any quarter. This very man, Ibrahim Khan, has several times before, as you will find from the records in your office, addressed letters asking for aid from the British Government, and proffering allegiance in return. His present appeal is not one whit more likely to receive a favorable reply from the Khan, than it did from the British Government. I am sorry therefore you have written as you did to Captain Harrison, for it has temporarily closed a very useful means of obtaining very valuable information. It is only very recently that I applied to Government to sanction a sum of money to be placed at Captain Harrison's disposal, for the purpose of procuring good intelligence from Seistan, a matter I consider of the greatest importance. 5. If the Khan were so unwise as to venture on interfareDce in the affairs of Seistan, a thing I look upon as most improbable, it only requires the expression of the wish of the British Government, that such a course should be discontinued, for it to be abandoned at once. Every act of the Khan hitherto, having reference to his dealings with Foreign States, goes to prove the correctness of this conclusion. 6. Nooroodeen Minghul was undoubtedly immediately to blame for the commencement of the last outbreak against the Khan. Of the nature, causes, and extent of the interference used by Captain Harrison in the case of Kumal Khan's Village, and of my disapproval at the time of the Khan's proposals regarding it. Government is already fully informed, the whole correspondence having been submitted when it was received. Captain Harrison's action in that matter did not produce results anticipated by Government in the letter you quote. The rebellion of the then Jam of Bey la in September last, was concocted as far back as the previous April, as was clearly evinced from his own letters to other Chiefs in Beloochistan, urging them to rise also, ' as arranged in April last.' 7. The designation Khan of Khelat, and Beloochistan, is not an unnatu ral one. I am not aware at the present moment whether it has ever been used before, but whether it has or not, I confess I do not see anything in its use now to give rise to apprehension, that it covers some deep design. 1 hough hitherto conventionally styled Khan of Khelat by us, he is really Khan otBeloochistan, his rule extending over all the Belooch, as well as Bruhooes dwelling within the limits of Beloochistan, which are well known and need no description. The title of Khan of Beloochistan would give him no more extended power than he has now. Besides in Seistan, there are hundreds of Belooch in the interior of the Punjauh, and some even in the neighbourhood of Delhi. Those in Seistan are no more connected with the Khanate of Khelat, than the latter now are, and I see no reason to anticipate any likelihood of a change. S. The indulgence m unnecessary suspicions regarding proceedings at Khe- at, in hasty imputation of wrong motives to His Highness the Khan, and in constant endeavour to find fault with the conduct of the Political A^ent at that Court is, I must say, once for all most objectionable. It is mosAmjnst both to His Highness, and to Captain Harrison, while at the same time, it is most injurious to the public interests, and needlessly takes up the time of those to whom the papers have to be submitted. I must desire, therefore, that you will refrain from pursuing this course any longer, and that as His High ness the Khan is I consider acting in no way contrary to the Treaty entered into y us with him, and Captain Harrison is acting well in accordance with the instructions laid down for his guidance, you will accord the friendly coun tenance due to the former, and the generous support to the latter, which he has a right to expect from you. I have the lienor to be, Sir, lour most obedient servant, W. L. MEREWETHER, Colonel, • .

The letter also reminds the Colonel that officers on the Punjaub [Punjab] frontier wishing to visit the Khan's dominions should inform him first, which is what had caused the dissatisfaction and irritation on the part of the Khan.The letter proceeds by stating that he does not see how the recent proceedings at Khelat could be viewed as unbecoming or a dangerous sort of agitiation, and that what had occured was oring to an ommission of an act of courtesy towards the Khan, also that the enclosed copies of the Political Diary of Captain Harrison did not show anything that could be construed as an attack on His Highness the Ameer of Cabul [Amir of Kabul] and that nothing in the entries could be seen as a cause for alarm. Also stating that Ibrahim Khan had written similar letters to the British Government requesting aid in return for his allegience, and was no more likely to receive a favourable reply from the Khan, and that Colonel Phayre's response to Captain Harrison in this matter had temporarily closed this useful means of obtaining valuable information, for which Merewether had placed a sum of money at Captain Harrison's disposal for the purpose of procuring good intelligence from Seistan as it was considered a matter of the greatest importance.The letter concludes by again requesting that Colonel Phayre refrain from his unnecessary suspicions of proceedings in Khelat and his hasty assumptions of wrong motives from the Khan and his endeavours to find fault with Captain Harrison and stating that they are not all unjust to both individuals, but are injurious to public interests and needlessly take up the time of those individuals to whom correspondence his addressed.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x000012#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
