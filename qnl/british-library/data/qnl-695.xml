Kindly deliver following to Captain Dirdwood - deeply regret to hear sad news. Drey c/o G.Q. FaoDelhi, March 4 A press communique issued in the Foreign Denartment states that the last mail from the Persian Gul* brought full particulars of the unfortunate accident which caused the death of Mr. J.G.Lorimer, the officiting Resident at Eushire. On the morning of Sunday, February 8th, Mr. Lorimer after conversing with His Excellency the Governor o** Bu- shire on the telephone, left his office in which two of his assistants were working and went upstairs to his dressing room to ascertain the exact calibre of his automatic pistol as he wished to order some more cartridges from Bombay by the outward mail which left Bushire that day. He did not return to the office and eventually a search was made for him in connection with some oapers which required bis sig nature. He was found lying dead on the floor of his room. It was evident that Mr. Lorimer, in examining the pistol had pulled the trigger and discharged a last cartridge which had been overlooked in the magazine. The Residency Surgeon Major S. Hunt, I.M.S., who held the medical examination found that the bullet had entered the stomach and passed right through the body to the spine injuring the great blood vessels in its course. The shock in Major Hunt’s opinion, must have caused immediate loss of conciousness for the expression of the face was calm and peaceful, and death speedily followed from syncope. Ihe necessary enquiry was held by Caotain R.L.Birdwood, First Assistant to the Resident, Major S.Hunt, Residency Surgeon, Captain J.S.Crosthwaite,I.A., and Lieu tenant P.G.Loch, 2nd Assistant and their formal opinion was recorded, to the effect that Mr. Lofrimer met his death from wounds caused by the accidental discharge of’ an au tomatic pistol. Ihe funeral took place on the following day, February 9th. By the courtesy of the Senior Nayal Officer and the Officer- 7 ® / Officer Ooinmandlng the troops at Bushlre, a firing r^arty nadiers, and by the men of that Regiment. The coffin T vae drawn to the cemetery, preceded by the Residency escort and also at the special request Monsieur Loiko, the acting Russian Consul-General, by the Husain Cossac r Con sular Guard. The funeral ceremony was attended by His Ex cellency the Governor and the local authorities, the Con sular Corps, the whole of the European community as well as by a large number of the local i/ersian inhabitants who thus testified to the universal respect felt by all members of the community towards the deceased and the great popular ity he had earned during the short period of his incumb ency. Messages of sympathy were received by the British Legation at Tehran fro™ the Persian Government and from the French and German Ministers. of Bluejackets and Marines was landed ^rom H.M.S. w Fox w and the route was lined by the 10 o ad (King Edward f s Own) Gre-Buehire, Maroh 1914. a?o The ::5 olitieal Agent, K. u .v ait.

As you know I have been troubled for some time by a bad throat and husky voice. When I was at Bagdad I interviewed the throat specialists and the Consulting physician and they decided that the cause of the trouble was a strained heart, and ordered me off to England for complete rest. I am therefore sailing on the 20th by the S.S. 'Chakla', and write this to say good bye. It is not absolutely certain yet who will succeed me, but at present it looks as if Bill of the Indian Civil Service, who was First Assistant here and acting Consul at Shiraz some years ago would do so.
