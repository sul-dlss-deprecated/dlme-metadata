Alleged persecution of Iraqi Jews. You may be questioned about the treatment of Jews in Iraq to which Israeli Government have recently drawn our attention. 2. Enquiries made by H.M. Ambassador at Baghdad have shown that the arrests of about 36 Jews have been made following the distribution in Baghdad of a pro-Zionist pamphlet in Hebrew printed in Tel Aviv and entitled 'Methods of Action'. 3. In replying to the press enquiries we intend to say that as everyone knows we are strongly opposed to the persecution of minorities anywhere. In the present case there appears a ccnfliction of evidence and we have, in any case, no locus standi for intervening in Iraqâ€™s internal affairs. 4. For your own information we are calling Iraq's attenUon informally to the amount of interest which this matter is causing in the outside world and to the likelihood that it will cause them difficulties at the United Nations and elsewhere and suggesting that their best course is to publish the facts.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000098_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/5/169</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000098</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/5/169</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 2/16 Alleged persecution of Iraqi Jews'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1949/1949</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-02-27T22:07:05</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (2 folios)</extent><extent>The foliation sequence for this description commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 4; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains a letter from the foreign office to the Political Residency in Bahrain regarding the persecution of Jews following the declaration of the State of Israel's independence the preceding year.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Iraqi Jews</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Baghdad</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Minority groups</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000098#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
