Heference our conversation on the subject of a recreation ground for this Agency on the piece of land adjoining the garden of Kohanmad Tayib. I think I undaratoo 1 from you verbally that there was no objection to our going forward with the preparation of this ground. I have got the loan of the levelling machine from Awali but Anderson says that before it can be used the ground needs to have the levels marked out. T have not got the necessary aoraratus for this ard was wondering wheth *r it would be possible for your Land Department to assist in showing the levels on the ground. I think it is practically level already but the^e may be one or two small bumps which havs to be shown. I should most grateful for any assistance you can giv ? me in this matter. The Overseer of this Agency has been over the ground with me and knows the area that we require. He could always be asked to show this to your people. /■v V. C.

His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, MANAMA, Bahrein Island. Dear Sir On January 11th the site of your two proposed lu foofball fields was inspected hy Messrs. Hallows, Jackson, and Andresen. At that time it was decided that before any work could be done toward grading, a levelling survey would have to be made and level stakes inserted in order that the extent of grading could be determined. It was proposed to have your State Engineer proceed with this work and we would be advised upon its completion so that we could arrange to release the necessary grading equipment to accomplish the work. Can you now advise when the levelling work will be completed in order that we can schedule the use of our grading equipment for this work to fit in with the balance of work we are now doing in our Plant. lu Acting Chief Local THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM Representative COMPANY LIMITED. &gt;*/&lt; 0D.O.No.138-18/15 Dated 21at Januaiy, 1941 Would you please refer to your letter No.PA-329 dated 19th January 1941. 2.
