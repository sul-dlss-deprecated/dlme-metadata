Concern about the trade is based on the fact that opium from these areas is lower in price than that from Bombay, and may therefore adversely affect the Bombay opium trade. Attached to the letter is a copy of an extract from the Digest of Intelligence for the week ending 25 December 1852, from the Deputy Collector of Customs in Kurrachee [KarƒÅchi], containing further details of the opium trade from Bushire to Sind via Muscat. Following the letter is a copy of letter no.11 of 1853 from Richard Spooner, Acting Opium Agent, dated 14 January 1853. The letter requests that the Political Agent in the Persian Gulf report on the opium trade from the Turkish Arabian and Persian coasts.A handwritten note on the verso of folio 14 states that the letter and its enclosures were received on 9 March 1853.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023655810.0x000003#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
