Memorandum:- k Reference your memorandum No. 498 dated 18th March 1941. No consulting architect was employed by the Bahrain government to design the Government Hospital which was built over a number of years from the beginning of 1938. The dispensary was built first and, later, the women’s hospital and then the male hospital. Blue prints of hospitals in Iraq and in India were obtained and examined before the plans were made and advice was obtained from the local doctors in Bahrain including Dr. Dame and Dr. Kennedy, also from the C.R.E. Iraq when visiting Bahrain. The plans were revised and altered many times owing to acquisition of more land and to suit the requirements of the medical officers in charge of the hospitals. In the summer of 1938 I showed the plans to Mr. C. Wright, A.R.I.B.A., of Clifford Street, London, who gave me some advice on them and discussed them with the late Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle who approved of them but suggested that Dr. Davenport Jones should make any recommendations for alterations when he arrived in Bahrain. I also showed the plans to4 (3 - 2 - to Lord Dawson, whom I know personally, who expressed much interest in the hospital. The work was done by local masons and labourers, not by contract, but under the supervision of the Superintendent of the Public Works Department. Other buildings in Bahrain such as the schools, customs buildings and law courts were built in a similar way. On Colonel Powle's advice all the equipment was ordered through the Government of India Stores Depart ment in London and the department recommended the type of equipment and fittings which should be used. Dr. Davenport Jones and I discussed this with the officials of the department with the assistance of the India Office. The cost of the various buildings was as follows Nurses* quarters, kitchens etc. and Lady Doctor’s and Matron’s flats, garages, stores etc. .. 84,000/- Dispensary, including Medical Officer’s quarters. (Of this h 13,000/- was cost or land reclamation) 87,000/- Men’s hospital, of which Rs 20,000/- was cost of founda- tions 89,000/- The site was chosen as being as far distant as possible from the existing hospitals, on the only piece of land on the shore owned by the government and close to the sea to facilitate drainage.

Memorandum:- Subject:Construction of Buildings and Roofing on the Catenarian Arch principle It is apparent that considerable improvement in the construction and roofing of buildings would be obtained if the Government of Bahrain adopted the above principle. The additional features of increased utility and economy are points also worthy of consideration. The principle can be applied to the whole construction of store buildings and the like, also to the roofing of sheds and residential houses. The present system of what practically amounts to a flat roof constructed of chendles, bamboo staves,mangoor mats, and protective layers of mud, cement and sand is most unsatisfactory from its ability to effectively withstand rain and other weather factors, and such work requires constant repair. The material used for Catenarian truction is simply a good sand-cement mixture and no reiniv^rce- ment whatsoever is required, a temporary skeleton frame struc ture of either wood of steel is used in ^ he / irst , t When the cement-sand mixture has set, this frame is and can be used again for similar constructions indefinitely. Once constructed its life is practically “i^i^nfl^Patenarv 1 withstand any rain fall. From the standpoint of cost Catenary Arch principle would undoubtedly be cheaper than any other form of building construction or roof structure. I attach rough sketches showing the outline of the principle i^vol for a complete building and also for a multiple lay ro ° f • wm you olease give this matter your consideration and autho rise me to constfuct either one or both of the above structures as the opportunity presents itself. I am confident that satisfactory results will be obtained and we shall have taken a step in the right direction s regards the provision of an urgent and essential improvment.
