IMMEDIATE. 0 Bahrain Petroleum Company have submitted to United States Government proposal for erecting special olant at Bahrain for production of 100-octane aviation fuel. Plant would be \ situated close to existing refinery of which it would really work as a part.* Company have stipulated that they will only proceed on basis of 100 per cent financing by United States Government. Before going any further latter have asked for views of His Majesty's Government. 2. His Majesty's Government are in favour of scheme and are anxious to reply as soon as possible to United States Govern ment. 1 should be glad therefore of your views and those of Political Resident very urgently and particularly on how best any possible difficulties with Shaikh could be overcome. Do you con sider new plant could be treated as covered by existing concession although for reasons arising out of Company's relatioffs with f United States Government technical ownership would probably vest in latter? It would presumably be desirable for any land, way leaves etc. needed for project to be acquired in name of Company ' rather than United States Government. 3. Purpose for which plant is to be erected should not be disclosed. In any approach to Shaikh it should be described as being required 'for essential war supplies for United Nations'.

Your telegrain 1240 June 30th., , My comments on India Office telegram are as follows. (1) I foresee no difficulties of any kind with Shaikh. (2) Proposed plant will merely be extension of existing refinery and is covered by present concession. (3) It is immaterial to Shaikh v/hether extension is paid for by United States Government or Company. (4) It is most improbable that new way leaves, land etc. will be required for project. If they are required they should be in name of Company. Reference your telegram para 3. Royalties to Shaikh will not be affected by production aviation spirit. In new plant Arabian crude will be used mainly if not exclusively but this con- tingency is already covered vide correspondence forwarded under this Agency Printed Letter No.C/531-10/1 dated 12th Nov amber 1935. At my request Anderson is telegraphing New v ork for specific assur ance that production of oil from Bahrain field will not be adverse ly affected by operation of new plant.

Your telegram No. 11458 June 27th. 100 Octane plant at Bahrain. 2. We find it difficult to comprehend why U.S.A. Government and Bahrain Petroleum Company are unable to come to some satisfact- \ ory contractual agreement by which U.S.A. Government provides 100 per cent finance while plant itself is property of Company. The latter 1 s obligations would be discharged by assigning profits on operation and by release of the plant for removal by U.S.A. Govern ment when no longer required at Bahrain. 3. The 100 octane plant would definitely have to be operated as an integral part of Bahrain refinery and would almost certainly be located in area reserved for refinery. We fail to see how Bahrain Petroleum Company concession could cover U.S.A. Government's ownership of property in refinery area. A further complication would arise in that operation of U.S.A. Government owned unit in ~ p' /s/- . refinery would for practical purposes deprive para 2 of schedule of Political Agreement of all value. 4. We should have liked to discuss matter with Bridgeman of Petroleum Department who is due here later this month but presume H.M.G. 1 s reply to U,S.A. Government cannot be delayed. We suggest therefore that U.S.A. Government be urged to come to some arrange ment with Company by which for the purpose of the latter 1 s concess- ' s ional relations with the Shaikh of Bahrain the plant becomes Company property . 5.

M*s. Political Agent, Bahrein. Dear Sir: u 11H j y r Further to my letter C/PA-53 of Llay 20th, 1943 and for the information of the Bahrein G-overnment, since the additional facilities which are to be installed will probably not be used wholly for the processing of Bahrein crude oil, the Company does not intend to claim as royalty deductible any crude oil or A * refinery products used in the construction of such facilities. - \ y* Products taken directly to the construction site are readily measurable and present no problem. They are being entirely I deducted from the gross royalty^figures. dQtluciUyle I However a small part of our products consumed (just under 1^) is used by intermediate general or joint service facilities such as motor equipment which serve all of our various activities. In this case the exact quantity of the products applicable to the construction program can not be measured. There fore, from July 1, 1943 a figure representing the monthly average quantity of products used in such facilities during the twelve month period ending June 30, 1943 is being taken as the proper monthly royalty deductible amount. Any products used in these facilities in excess of the average quantities will be considered as used in construction and non-deductible. Yours very truly, for X P.

Memorandum In connection with the enlargement of the Refinery the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited have asked me to inform the Bahrain Government that they do not intend to claim any deduction of royalty in respect of crude oil or refinery products used in the course of the new cons truction. 2. Oil products taken direct to the construction site are readily measurable and present no problem. A minor difficulty arises, however* in respect of such oil pro ducts as are used for joint service facilities (e.g. motor cars) which serve all of the Company's various acti vities. In order to ensure that no oil products on which royalty is properly payable escape assessment the Company propose, as from the 1st July 1943, to take as the amount of royalty deductible monthly the average amount of oil products used on joint service facilities during the 12 months ending on June 30th 1943. Thus any oil products used in these facilities in excess of the average quan tities of the previous 12 months will be considered as having been used on the construction project and no royalty will be deducted on their account, 3. The action which the Company propose to take in this respect is in conformity with the provisions of Article VII of the Lease of 29th December 1934 as modified by clause B(3) of the Supplemental Deed dated the 3rd June 1936. 4.

The following are my comments - (1) - The 100 Octane aviation spirit plant is definitely being delayed due to shortage of local labour. (2) - This shortage of local labour has been aggravated by other construction programmes on the Island, such as the U.S. A.T.C. building project and the Royal Navy's construction works, since if these projects were not being carried out there would obviously be more labour available for the aviation project. (3) - If the U.S. A.T.C. and Royal Navy projects were curtailed or postponed, thus releasing local labour, the completion of the 100 octane aviation project would be speeded-up. W, P. Anderson.

I * ^ 1 Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf, July 15, 1944. 'TSP nh. H.B.M.'s Political Agent, The Agency, Bahrein Island. V ^J ^nAA Dear Sir: ^ Please refer to your Confidenxial letter No,c/I065 dated 13th J'uly, 1944, which transmitted llx. Van Sickle^ telegram No.33 dated lEth July, 1^44. Also, please refer to Mr. Van Sickle^ telegram No. 32, datec^/July 7, and to my reply contained in my letter to you, C /PA-151, July 9th. 1. It is inferred from Mr. Van Sickle^ telegram No.33 that he is assuming that there are 1400 native labourers working on the U.S.A.T.C. project. It is my understanding from hearsay reports that the number employed at present is somewhat less than this number. 2. I have heard that British Indian pioneer troops are being brought in to work on the U.S.A.T.C. and R.A.F. building projects at Muharraq, and that the R.A.F., who are supervising the projects, wish to increase the number of native labourers employed, in addition to the use of the pioneer troops. 3. It is understood that the U.S.A.T.C. project is nearing completion, and that work is starting on the R.A.F. project, which is to be considerably larger than the U.S.A.T.C. project. If this is true, it would not do much good to re tard the U.S.A.T.C. project and release labour if the R.A.F. project were to use an equivalent, or greater amount of native labour on their project. In other words, the U.S.A.T.C. and R.A.F. projects must be considered together in considering the release of labour for theAviation Project. 4. Two thousand additional native labourers could be gainfully employed on theAviation Project. It/...2—H.B.M.'s Political Agent, Bahrein: July 15, 1944. 5. It is estimated that the completion dates of the various units of the Aviation Project could be speeded up by two weeks by the use of 1,000 additional native labourers, if obtained shortly, and used until the native labour shortage eased. This time-saving would be in addition to time which would be gained by any other means. 6. It is hoped that, at the end of the pearling season, (October), there will be sufficient native labour to satisfy the demands of all concerned. The need for native labour from the U .S .A. T.C. and R.A.F. projects is therefore from now until October. The estimate ??;iven in paragraph (5) above, is based on an additional 1,000 natives for this period only. 7. The Company is exploring the possibilities of ob taining labour from every conceivable source; for example, from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Persia and Egypt. Even though successful iq. their efforts, there is little hope of alle viating the labour shortage from such sources within a reasonable length of time, due to the time involved in obtaining such outside labour, and in making arrangements for housing and feeding them.

Labour The labour situation has improved somewhat though both the largest employers of labour, the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the Royal Air Force, still require coolie labour, the former in particular still being in need of about 2,500 men. However, the wage increases approved in the meeting of employers held in the Agency on 14th July have had some effect. The Bahrain Petroleum Company report that their coolie labour is up by about 12% on their figures of men employed on July 1st and by 6th August the number employed was 5,330, The R.A.F. report an. increase of about 100%, the numbers on 15th August being about 981. Efforts made by the Company to obtain labour from Persia have not been very successful. Inquiries made in Saudi Arabia also have not been fruitful.and it is thought that labour from this quarter will not be available until after Ramadan. Inqui ries pursued in Iraq have met with no success. The Company have lately turned their attention to the possibility of obtaining Italian labour. Italian internee labour from Egypt has been considered unsuitable but inquiries are being made concerning a -better type of Italian colonist labour in Eritrea which has already been successfully employed by the Americans there. The inquiries are exploratory at present and it has been pointed out that employment of the above labour would require to be approved by British Security authorities and the political authorities in the Gulf. The employment of such labour, if in any number, would present both a policing (from the point of view of maintaining good order) and a security problem.7 V 10/18 and 12/22 ' . • ' ;•&gt; Telegram 3(A) From Folitioal Agent, Bahrain To Political Resident at 3hiraz No.-I a Dated 31st August 1944. 1MF0HT AMT Heflnery C onstruction Frogramme 1. Anderson General Manager and Nichols Vine ^resident of the Bahrain Petroleum company interviewed me today August 31st with regard to the possibility of their renruiting seven hundred (half 1,4C0) Italian artisans from Eritria. 2. They explained that their construction programme for the 100 octane plant was seriously behind schedule and that they were having the greatest pressure put on them by-Washington and the Allied ^hicfs of Staff to speed up their work by increasing their skilled labour. Tfeey considered for variousr easons that it was not practicable to increase their American force to the extent necessary appreciably to advance the completion date. They had heard of apparently suitable labour in liritria and felt bound to enquire our reactions at once to employing Italians in Bahrain. 3. A Bahrain Petroleum company r epresentative visited Eritria and was informed by the Military Governor, LiOngrigg that efficient and politically harmless labour was available which would be allowed back into Eritria on completion of the work in May next year. 4. The Company propose to house the men in a tent camp to be supplied by jfAlFORc#. They will probably be rationed by the Persian Gulf Service command and their transport to Bahrain may be arranged by the War Shipping Adiministration. it is understood that condi tions in Eritria are so wretched that the Italians will welcome tent accommodation and employment here. ^5. The company are worried about security and would ks like to be assured that are satisfied that these Italians are not undesirable from a security point of view. 6. The Company are very concerned about the Shaikh's attitude and asked my views. I said that i would make no pronouncement until X had seen the Shaikh which I should not do until 1 had your instruc- tions but that Arabs had for many years disliked Italians.» i v. 7. My iuipression Is that the Company do not themselves welcome the proposal but xeeJ. thrit as .ashington are so insistent they miist explore any possii^ility, in spite of' obvious draw ba^ks. 1 understand that even should this additional labour arrive by December the project will be completed only obe mpnth earlier. 8. i do not favour the proposal and anticipate opposition from His Highness even though the Company do guarantee that the Italians will only be used for urgent oonstruotion work and will not replace Arab work-men. The presence of a large number of our ex-enemies here free to wander at will will be politically highly objectionable. The pro bability of racial disturbance in the refinery and town must be expe^tai The policing of the Italians and the removal of undesirables among them will prove difficult. Supply and security problems will not be easily solved. 9. If it is decided that this Italian labour must be used then we should i consider insist on:- (a) k guarantee from the Sritrian Government that they will the. accept them on completion of/work* (b; An assurance from FAIFUH^S that adequate tentage Is available. (We are to some extent responsible for the proper housing of civilians). (c) An assurance from the Persian Gulf Service command that they will provide rations of all kinds. We have insufficient fresh provisions sfor our present population. (d) An assurance that there are no security objections to their presence in Bahrain and the Kefinery. v (e) Adequate police arrangements being made by the Military autho rities before the Italians arrive. It villi also be necessary to provide this Agency with an additional European officer for magisterial and other duties. 10. The Company would be very willing to consider any alternative source of labour but housing conditions are such that only tent accom modation would be available.

His Highness said he had permitted Persians to come to Bahrain to work with the Bahrain Petroleum Company but was seriously alarmed at their increasing numbers. He feared a demand for consular repre sentation after the war. Arabs and British subjects he welcomed but objected to all foreigners and (fesired to restrict their ingress. 4. His Highness' demeanour suggested that the project was too fantastic to warrant serious consideration and the objections too obvious to need recitation. He drew my attention to the captured Italian guns in front of the palace. i Political ay10/18 • Telegram 3( .J From Political ^cent, Bahrain i&gt; # # Political Reside tit at ohiraz No. c/X Dated 3th Jeptember 1944. ihttRXHifrcc Reference ray telegram No.733 dated olst August and ny telegram No.316.dated Jeptember 7th. 2.

In view of the expressed views of His Highness the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Honourable Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, we will not further consider the importation of Italian labour into Bahrein. For your information, we sent a party to Hofuf, Saudi Arabia, to explore the possibility of engaging Saudi Arabs from that area. This party has just returned and states that there are many difficulties connected with such an undertaking, the chief of which is that it will be necessary to pay in the order of 3 Saudi Arab ryals per day, plus £&gt;od, to attract unskilled labour from that area. In view of this it is felt that we should not import this labour and risk upsetting the Bahrein wage scales until after every effort has been made to obtain sufficient labour locally. The Company is considering certain schemes for attracting more local labour and I will be calling on you within the next few days to discuss the matter. W.P. Anderson. Chief Local Representative.

Dear Sir, With reference to our conversation of 8th October, 1944, the Company proposes to recruit and import up to a maximum of 500 Iraqi artizans for work on the Refinery expansion program. This move is considered necessary to speed the completion of the new facilities, which is very desirable for the AHied war effort. These men will be used as helpers to the American journeymen, a job for which but very few Bahrein! workmen are qualified. Their use will not reduce the number of Bahreini workmen employed on the job. In recruiting these men, the Company intends to pay substantially the same wages as are now being paid its regular local and Indian artizans. It is proposed to house the men in tent camps which the Company hopes to obtain from Paiforce. They will be furnished rations by the Company, which the Company hopes to obtain from MESC. These men will not be considered for permanent positions in the Company's regular organization and the Company will repatriate them at the completion of the Refinery expansion program. I will appreciate your advice if there is any objection to the Company's proposal. Yours very truly, for W. P.

Correspondence ending with your telegram No.21822 September 30th. I do not consider it desirable to ask Shaikh to reconsider question of Italian workmen for Bahrain. It must be remembered that Arabs regard Italians from totally different point of view to ourselves and cannot understand clemency shown them. 2. Following are reasons given by Shaikh for his refusal. (a) In opinion of all Arabs Italians were dis honourable people in whom no trust should be reposed. (b) His people had not forgotten or forgiven Italian air raid on Bahrain in Ramazan 1941. (c) He welcomed Arabs and British subjects but was strongly cktfposed to ingress of other foreigners. In the ihtep#std of the war effort he had permitted immigration of Persian labour for Bahrain Petroleum Company but was seriously alarmed at their growing numbers • 4* ^ (d) The importation of Italian labour was in his opinion not only against the interests of his State but also of His Majesty^ Government. He would never giv^hAs consent willing ly and his subjects would never credit that heTobne so. They would blame His Majesty's Government even though Italians behaved in an exemplary manner. (e) He considers that if Company raised their wagej rate; temporarily this would soon attract sufficient unskilled labour to meet deficit. In any case he considers ( and Political Agent agrees) that at least one thousand additional labour will be available on return of pearling fleet at end of October. 3. From our point of view the security position in Bahrain is already most unsatisfactory and importation of large number of Italians, whose presence would be strongly resented by local inhabitants, would almost certainly give rise to incidents with serious and unpleasantly wide repercussions.

Ill of the Lease as amended by tne Deed of 3rd June 1936 can be interpreted as exempting Saudi Arabian crude oil imported to Bahrain for treatment in the Bapco Refinery from every kind of tax or duty. If however it is so interpreted it can make no difference whether the crude oil is imported by pipe-line or tanker. 4.

The 31st of August, 1946 Dear Colonel Hay, Will you please refer to your demi-official letter No.C /783 dated the 27th August, 1946.^ 2. As far as I am aware imports of Arabian crude oil, and their products, are not sold in Bahrain, and the royalty paid on the Bahrain oil used in the refining of them is the only benefit which the BahrAin Government derives from them. I discussed the point with Belgrave some weeks ago and he agreed that, with the exception referred to above, imports of Arabian crude oil were exempt from every kind of tax and duty, and that this was the interpretation hitherto given to Article III of the Lease as amended by the Deed of 1936# f 3. The construction of the present pipe line was taken as ^ a war measure and authority to take the action suggested in Agency letter No.C/261 dated the 5th February, 1944, was ^T given in Residency telegram No«426 dated the 22nd February. &gt; 1946. Further correspondence on this subject rests witb the, iiCj enclosure to Agency printed Letter No .c /1696 dated the ^6th November, 1944. The Shaikh's specific permission to con- ^ f struct the pipe line was not apparently obtained, and in view of Article I of the Lease as modified by the Deed I do not consider that this was necessary. 4. It is possible that His Highness may now put forward the argument that it was never visualised in 1936 that such large quantities of Arabian crude oil would be imported by the Company as is now the case, but, 'as far as I can see, there are in actual fact no legal limits to the quantity which it is permissible so to import. I must also point out that the Company gave us clearly to understand during the Vv ^ negotiations leading up to the Deed that foreign oils might 1 ^ be used in the Bahrain Refinery, vide Ballantyne's letter 0 dated the 12th August, 1935, forming enclosure to India Office complimentary slip No. P.Z. 5591 dated the 16th August, 1935, ^ and paragraph 9 of his letter dated the 30th August, 1935, forming enclosure to India Office complimentary slip No# P.Z. 6169 dated the 2nd September, 1935; and that it was considered n0 an additional advantage by the Admiralty that foreign oils P- V ^ produced in other parts of the Gulf should be refined here, ■ vide enclosure to India Office complimentary slip No. P.Z.5891 dated the 26th August, 1935. I should add that permission to import them was one of the considerations that decided the Company to locate their Refinery at Bahrain. 5. In the circumstances I am of the opinion that it would only be possible at this stage for us to reopen the subject with the Company on the groundsof equity, as opposed to argument on the legal point, and I should hesitate, at present, to venture an opinion as to what their reaction to such an approach would be.

Dalrymple Belgrave, Ssquire, C.B.3., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that His Highness noticed a few days ago that an additional pipe line is being laid alongside the existing line from Arabia to the Bahrain Refinery by the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, also a new road is being constructed along the line from Rafaa to the western coast. 2. His Highness is surprised that the Bahrain petroleum Company Limited failed to notify the Bahrain Government about this work and wishes me to enquire why it was been commenced without his know ledge. His Highness presumes that this will result in increased imports of foreign oil into Bahrain. When the Bahrain Government agreed to allow foreign oil to be brought into Bahrain by barges and later by a pipe line the amount of oil was comparatively small. In view of the imminent increase in the quantity of imported oil His Higliness wishes to ex plore the possibilities of making a charge on oil To His Britannic Majesty^ Political Agent, Bahrain.which is brought into Bahrain from Saudi Arabia. The importation of Arabian crude oil brings no additional revenue to Bahrain nof has it increased to any visible extent the number of Bahrain subjects who are employed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. 3.

It is possible, if the question had been opened in a different way, that I might have recommended that it should be considered 'on the grounds of equity' (paragraph 6 of Ranee 1 s letter). As it is, and in view of the fact that the Shaikh makes Zubarah an excuse for not acting upon our suggestions even when put in the most friendly way, I propose, subject to your consent, to reply to the effect that (i) Article 1 of the Bapco Lease as modified by the Deed gives the company the right to construct, erect, and operate pipelines and roads in any part of the territory under the control of the Shaikh so far as may be necessary for the purpose of their business. /(U) Hon'ble Lt-Col.

(iii) It does not appear to be incumbent upon vthe Bahrain petroloum company to inform the Bahrain Government of works such as that mentioned at (i) above.

I see no objection to your replying to the Adviser as proposed in sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) of your letter. 3. It would appear that the new pipe-line and road being alongside the old pipe-line and road are in the area reserved in 1944 (Agency printed letter No. 1696, ^ dated the 25th November, 1944). Reservation is not enjoined by Article II of the Lease but is a practical necessity e.g. if any questions of compensation is involved. The reply proposed in sub-paragraph (iii) of paragraph 3 of y ou r letter could, therefore, perhaps be qualified by the addition of a phrase such as 'unless any special question, e.g. compensation for use and occupancy of land, arises'. 4 # if you deem it necessary to make a communication to the Adviser on the lines proposed in the last sub paragraph of paragraph 3 of your letter I would suggest that this should be done either verbally or in a separate personal letter.

C I confirm that the Company's new pipeline is ; laid within the limits of the reserved area approved!, by the Bahrein Government in their letter No, 729 dated 14th November, 1944, which was transmitted to the Company under your letter No. C/1695 of the 25th November, 1944, The road constructed by the Company when laying the original 12' pipeline was not wholely within the reserved area mentioned above because of topographical considerations. However, as the Bahrein Government in giving its approval stipulated that the road must be con sidered a public thoroughfare, and further that the Company has the right under the original lease dated 29th December- 1934, as amended by the Supplemental Deed of the June, 1936, and the Deed of Further Modification of 19th June, 1940, to construct roads within the Sheikh's dominion as may be necessary for the purpose of its business, the Company considers that it was not mandatory that the road be within the area reserved for the pipeline. The original road is not being abandoned but is being repaired and placed in usable condition after the construction of the new line. The Company estimates that approximately 95 percent of the old road is being retained, however, there are a few locations where it was necessary to deviate from the old road because of encroachment by the new pipeline.

W R. UAY. igned) &gt; v • 1V ' ^3.A.B. Burrows, Esq., Foreign Office, London_ i I P! I 1 V 15? . 1 sDoke to Hr. V, r ard Anderson this morning about the scheme for adding to the Hefinery. We agreed that no specia' agreement v /as required, from the Shaikh though, of course, he would be informed that new plant v/as to be erected, Mr. Anderson explained that the present Refinery plant could' deal theoretically with 35,000 barrels ofc rude per day. 20,000 barrels of this would come from the Bahrain field and 15,000 from the Casoc field if the plant were to be used to its maximum capacity. At present there are two crude stills; and the present proposal involves the erection of a third still which could deal with approximately 13,000 barrels per day. l!r. Anderson said that the new still (referred to as the Houdry plant) would normally deal entirely with Casoc crude oil since, given an equal quantity of Bahrain and Gasoc crude oil, the Casoc crude produces a greater amount of high grade gasoline. Casoc crude is, in fact, lighter than Bahrain crude. For the same reason Bahrain crude produces a better fuel oil than Casoc crude. Vr. Anderson said, however, that the new Houdry plant could also deal with Bahrain crude though maximum efficiency would not be obtained i.e. the amount of high grade gasoline obtained from Bahrain crude would be approximately 5 per cent less than the amount obtainable from Casoc crude. 2. Mr. Anderson said that the Shaikh's present position in regard to royalties would not in any way be affected by the operation of the new plant. 1 asked him if he could give me a written assurance that production from the Bahrain fields (on which the Shaikh 1 s royalties depend) would not be affected adversely by the bringing into operation of the new plant. He said that, as he understood the position, the Shaikh's royalty prospects would be improved by the . erection of the new plant as a greater proportion of Bahrain oil could be put through the existing Refinery. Before giving the written assurance, however, he would like to refer the matter to his principals and he told me that he would send off a cable today to secure the necessary assurance 1/7/42.141 yesterday afternoon Mr, Ruissell Brown rang me up and said that they have been informed by Colonel Booth of the P.G.S.C^ Basra, that he was arranging to send an American civilian, W.J.Kelly by name, temporarily to Bahrain as the p.G.S.C's representative to unload some drum-plant equipment here. This plant would be for fabricating drums and cans for aviation petrol and is connected withfnew extension project. (Mr. Russell Brown said it had not been decided whether the drum-plant was to be built here or somewhere else in the Gulf, but it certainly seems to be the intention to build it here). I therefore issued the telegram below to Britconsul, Basra. &lt;^7 13/8/1 8/1343 IdU . tv cyf/V-ts ^ ^-^3, , 9 tiiUiLjsL liJL ^ I cAjajU-i- \ t ' E -■ t|.
