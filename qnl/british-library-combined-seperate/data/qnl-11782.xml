It concerns reports that the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] is considering introducing a telephone system (consisting of around 80-100 connections) to the towns of Muscat and Matrah (transliteration varies throughout).The file features the following principal correspondents: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Secretary of State for India; the Sultan of Muscat and Oman; representatives of the India Office, the Commonwealth Relations Office, Cable and Wireless Limited, and the Automatic Telephone and Electric Company.The correspondence covers the following: the British authorities' concerns that the contract for the proposed work should go to a British firm, with Cable and Wireless Limited being considered the prime candidate; Cable and Wireless's initial reluctance to take an interest in the proposed installation, following 'none too happy' experiences with telephone systems in Bahrain and Kuwait; the submission of a tender in February 1947 by the Automatic Telephone and Electric Company for the supply of telephone equipment to Muscat; proposals submitted in September 1947 by Cable and Wireless for the installation of a telephone system in Muscat and Muttrah, including details of installation costs, and a stated intention to invite tenders for the supply of material in the form of sub-contracts.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Automatic Telephone and Electric Company Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Telephone companies</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India and Burma, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Cable and Wireless Ltd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commonwealth Relations Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Telephone</topic></subject><subject><topic>Telecommunications</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000037#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000037#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000037#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000037#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
