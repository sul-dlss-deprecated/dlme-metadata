The eye symbolizes legitimate kingship, it secures the life of the sun-god, and also of other deities, as well as human beings. In the Horus myth the eye was stolen from its legitimate owner Horus, by Seth, the god of the wild, powerful, and untamed nature. This violent act caused disorder in the universe, and the eye had to be brought back to reestablish order, and to heal in its place with Horus. \r\n\r\nAs an amulet the Udjat-eye should secure life in this world and in the afterlife, protect health, and promote healing. The standardized form of the amulet combines the human eye with the cheek marking of a falcon and the tear marking of a cheetah. \r\n\r\nBesides the right Udjat-eye there is also a left version. While the right eye is connected with the sun, the left eye represents the moon. Most of the Udjat-eye amulets have a green-blue or red color; in this case different colors are combined to reflect the polychromy of life and nature.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1929", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/9339", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1929, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "22nd-26th Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:39.847", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_47.265_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_47.265_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_47.265_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_47.265_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_47.265_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "454, 2513", "Images": "CUR_47.265_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_47.265_Rev_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_47.265_SideA_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_47.265_SideB_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_47.265_Top_DD_RS2009.jpg, PS1_47.265_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
