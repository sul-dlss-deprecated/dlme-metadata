REPATRIATION CF SMALL CURRENCY.O ' j£ Copy of Express Letter No.1896-60/17 9 dated the 5th SOpteraber ^ 1947, from the Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain, to Government of India, Ministry of External Affairs and Common wealth Relations, New Delhi. , Reference Foreign endorsement No.F.6 (30)-BPG/47 dated the 26t_h June, 1947. Repatriation of quateranary rupees from Kuwait, Bahrain, and Dubai. 2. The Imperial Bank of Iran, Bahrain, have a surplus stock of approximately Rs .1.10,000/- of small coins (8 anncts 4 annas, 2‘annas and 1 anna) and enquire whether they could ship these small coins to the Reserve Bank of India, Bombay, under the existing scheme. • 3. Under the existing -scheme only quaternary rupees can be shipped to India at the Government of India's cost and risk but in view of the fact that there is no longer any demand for small coins in Bahrain, it is requested that tne^ Imperial Bank of Iran, Bahrain, may kindly be allowed to ship them to the Reserve Bank, of India, Bombay, at the Government of India's cost and risk. Copy of telegram No.891, dated the 30th January, 1948, from the Government of India, New Delhi, to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain. Please refer to Foreign telegram No.3270 dated April 26th 1947 and your express letter No.1896-60/17 dated 8th September 1947. Silver coins accumulated with banks. i 2. In view of heavy cost of transport Government of India can no longer undertake the repatriation of quater naries and accumulated small coins with banks in Persian Gulf stations at Government expense and risk orders in our telegram No.3270 dated April 26th 1947 may be treated as cancelled. 3„ in view of this decision it is gegretted therefore Government cannot authorise shipment of small coins worth 1,10,000 rupees accumulated with Imperial Bank of Iran. 4. Pledse communicate this decision to Kuwait and Dubai.Telegram From To No* A/142* Dated the 23rd February, 1948. G.T.C. Political Resident, Bahrain. Government of India, New Delhi* 2. Your telegram No* 891 January 30th* Following from Political Agent, Kuwait, begins* Your endorsement No. 299 February 4th. Repatriation of coin to India. 2 . I understand local bank has some seven lakhs rupee coin on hand and that recent decision of Government of India will mean that they will either have to refuse to accept rupee coin in future or accept it at a discount to allow for cost of repatriation to India. 3. It seems likely this will cause a local devaluation of rupee which would be most undesirable. - Ends.

London, S.W.l. INDEXED Sir, V* -v - Foreign Office. 6th JamLgry, 1948 t 1 ’ .J- ' I (ft- ./ith reference to the enclosed copy of an express letter, ,daeLfid the 3 rd December , 194'7, froiu the Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain, I alii directed by Mr. Attlee to enquire whether the Secretary of State for Coiunionwealth Relations is willing to advise him as to the best diet hod for funding the Muscat Agency when the Government of India Treasury ceases to operate in Muscat. 2. The Foreign Office is strongly in favour of the third suggestion in the letter in preference to the first and second, but before arriving at any decision it is desired to ascertain whether the three courses suggested exhaust all.possible methods of funding the post. o. I am to add that if the third suggestion is adopted the sterling bills of exchange v/ould be drawn on the Foreign Office and not on His Majesty’s Treas ury. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant,«» i ' Secretary, Economic Department Please see enclosures to endorsement No. 3434-93/5 of the 12th November from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf about the use of the Muscat Treasury by the public for rupee remittances between Muscat and India. So far as I am aware, the position is that up to now the Muscat Treasury has not been a full Treasury in the sense that its transactions have been confined to y . Government, or rather official, business only i.e. dispersements of salaries of Government servants, payments to the Sultan under various agreements, telegraphic remittances from India in connection with Government contract work. Post Office receipts, etc. Merchants requiring rupees from India arranged for their transmission through Post Office channels by postal or telegraohic money orders. The cost of such remittances was of course high in comparison with the cost of remittances through the .reasuxy and there has in consequence y always been a demand for full Treasuxy facilities at Muscat where there is no bank. When the Muscat Treasury was established it was y I think y never intended that it should provide facilities for the general public. The present staff consists of a ireasury officer (whose main pre-occupations lie outside Treasury matters and consist mainly of running the Agency office) and an accountant, who also maintains the Agency accounts. There is no 'schroff' or cashier to undertake dispersements of cash, which in the case of large sums, take a considerable time. In the past, it has, I believe, been seldom necessary for specie to be remitted from India as in-coming money in the way of receipts from the Muscat Government, Cable and Wireless Ltd. and the Post Office, covertout-going money in the way of salaries and other dispersements. The Government of India have agreed to the continuance of the existing Treasuries in the Gulf until the 31st March, 1948, and after that date it is the /intentionintention that local banks- should take over their functions. So far no bank has been established at Muscat, but the Eastern Bank Ltd. have now agreed to send a representative to Muscat to examine the possibility of their opening a branch there in the near future. -Resident's suggestion, beyond saying that apart from the arge amount of extra work that will fall on the small staff, I am somewhat doubtful of the wisdom of emptying the Muscat Treasury in order to avoid having to ship specie to India when the time comes to close the Treasury. The Eastern Bank Ltd. will, if they decide to open a branch at Muscat, require rupees should have thought it would have been possible for them to have acquired these from the Treasury by arrangement with the Reserve Bank of India and the Controller of Currency. I do not think that there is much we can do at this stage, but should be grateful for any comments or suggestions you may have. Please also see the Political Resident's telegram No. 1220 of the 25th November on the subject of exchange control. Copies of this telegram are now being sent to the Treasury and Bank of England who will no doubt wish to comment. I am not sure as to the meaning of paragraph 3 of this telegram. The quotas of hard currency sanctioned for the Gulf States do not, so far as I am aware, apply to food stuffs only, but to all consumer goods such as medical supplies, motor vehicles, etc., which could be classified as essential to the economic requirements of the community. I am not clear as to what is meant by the statement that 'all such imports are so restricted whether from countries inside or outside scheduled territories', as I was under the impression that exchange comment on the Political control did not operate so far as the sterling area is concerned. I should be glad of your comments. /( /* Ji vrs3^. WITH THE COMPLIMENT! of t.i f yT , u^oer seciil i pusiA ow rmzoercz, mjkfaxx.

Bahrain 3rd December, 1947, Urgent decision is required regarding financing of Muscat Agency after March 31st 1948 when Government of India Treasury there will presumably be closed. Even if the Eastern Bank decide to establish a branch there it is unlikely that this decision can be put into effect before the beginning of 1949 at the earliest. 2. The Political Agent reports that the average income of the Muscat Agency is approximately Rs. 1,000 per month and that the average monthly expenditure Rs. 8,000 in addition to which bills averaging rupees 12,500 monthly are paid on account of the R.A.F. apparently on account of expenditure incurred by them at Muscat and Salalah. 3.

It really means that the Political Agent will continue to maintain his own treasury as at present. If any difficulty is experienced in selling drafts it will presumably be possible to keep the Political Agent in funds by forwarding cash by steamer from Bahrain.
