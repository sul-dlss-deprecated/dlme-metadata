His main business in Bushire however was to locate the Register of an American Vessel that was sold in Bushire in April 1862, which Mr Edwards informed him that the Register had been given to the purchaser, and agreed to write a certificate to that effect.The letter continues under date 21 March 1863 discussing an overcharge of Government Funds; the arrival via the
                           Coringaof eighteen packages of tents for the embassy at Tehran and difficulties in getting letters and packets on board to be sent to India as well as complaints from merchants in Bushire over difficulties in retrieving their merchandise which Edwards believes are being caused by the B.I.S.N Co. [British India Steam Navigation Company] not having an agent at Bushire to handle such matters.The letter goes on to discuss Syed Mahomed Hindy, who was travelling from Bombay to Tehran with his mother and sister with certificates of British Protection issued by the mission at Tehran but who the Governor of Bushire would not recognise as a British dependent, despite Edwards submitting the relevent papers. Edwards reports on a further incident in which a maidservant of Syed Mahomed Hindy's was seized by police and allegations of more serious crimes which were made against him by the Governor of Bushire, with Edwards recommendations that Syed Mahomed Hindy remain in Bushire until Pelly returned in order to investigate and address these allegations.Other matters discussed in the letter include information that Edwards was gathering on Trade in Bushire for a report Pelly was to submit; an urgent request for Mr Hayward's services in Shiraz to treat the grandson of Hajee Kuwam who was reported to be very ill; Syfoo, the residency sweeper, having robbed someone of 98 krans and absconded and his parents having 'made good' the debt.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024189687.0x000003#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
