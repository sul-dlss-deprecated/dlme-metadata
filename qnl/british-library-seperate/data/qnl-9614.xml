It is a critique of the Government of India's current policy towards Makran, which he claims has not been authorised by the Home Government. This policy depends on the Khan of Kelat, Mir Mahmud Khan, maintaining stability in the region; it is the author's opinion that he does not have the means to do so, and more direct British intervention is required.The report contains a brief account of Makran, covering its geography, recent history, and relations with Britain. It also explains how British policy towards the region has developed, and the interventions that have been instigated as a result. It also outlines what the author considers Britain's interests in the area to be.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Khan of Kalāt, rulers of Kalāt</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Makran Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kelat</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial policy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000788.0x0002fa#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
