THE SECRETARY, WAR OFFICE CONFIDENTIAL. Sir, I ara directed hy the Secretary of State for India to refer to the correspondence ending with your letter of 6th March 1922 No.0162/117 M.I.1. regarding the maintenance of an intelligence post under the Military Attache at Meshed. As was stated in my letter of 25th May 1922 (P.1869) the Government of India arranged, by making sacrifices in other directions and by reduction of the Meshed establishment itself, to keep it in being for a year; and it is now necessary to review the o' position once more In Mr.Pates secret letter of 2nd August No.10764/9 (C.G.S.- M.0.3) - of which a copy has been forwarded separately to your Department - the Government of India point out the value to the Imperial Government of the work of the wireless 0140a 5000 6.23. wireless installation under the Military Attach^, Meshed, as shown by recent events. Viscount Peel does not contend that this work is not of value also to the Government of India, but he desires to draw particular attention to the facts adduced by the Government of India as to its importance to His Majesty’s Government. The Government of India point out further that this wireless woik cannot, as was suggested in your letter of 6th March 1922, be carried on efficiently even by a full-time station in Northern India without the aid of the Meshed station as a complementary organisation. As regards the present and potential value of the woik of the Military Attache as distinct from that of the wireless installation the Secretary of State entirely shares the view of the Government of India; and in this connection I am to remind you that, as was stated in my letter of 12th November 1921 and is not disputed by the Army Council, the defence of India against attack from regions beyond the confines of Afghanistan is an Imperial liability. Lord Peel finds it difficult to believe that the maintenance of an intelligence organisation in theadvantageously situated post for the collection of informationmummmmmamBamtummBtnBi Draft Paper. Department. information from Trans-Gaspia and Turkestan is a matter of ^j&amp;yrre indifference to the Army Council and His Majesty’s Government. The Government of India state that without assistance from Imperial Revenues they will be unable to continue to maintain the intelligence organisation at Meshed even on its present reduced scale, and that the economies which will be necessary will almost certainly diminish its value very considerably, even if they do not necessitate closiiog it down altogether: they therefore urge pnce more that the annual contribution of £950 formerly paid from Imperial Revenues may be renewed. This request Lord Peel earnestly supports. The fixed annual contribution of £950 represented, prior to August 1914, ! 1 ' dne hialf of the annual cost of the post. It now represents little more than one-third of the cost, which is estimated for the current year at Es.39,400, and has been brought down to this figure only by the adoption of the very unsatisfactory of leaving the Military Attache unseconded from 6 440a r.000 (&gt;.23I am to say, further, that though the request for the renewal of the contribution is addressed to the Array Council, by whom the payment was formerly made, it is not overlopked that at the present time the work of the Intelligence organisation at Meshed is of no less interest to the Foreign Office (to whom the letter of which a copy is attached is being addressed) than to the War Office. j I am therefore to express the hope that, on whichever departmental vote the charge may be thought more properly to fall, the Array Council and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs will urge upon The Lords Commissioners of the Treasury the desirability of renewing from Imperial Revenues the contribution of £950 p.a. which is necessary to enable- the Government- ef-Xndia-to- &lt; maintaW/the organisation in a state of usefulness, or even in existence.'

The Council are unable to alter their opinion previously expressed that the retention of an intelligence post at Meshed is not essential from an imperial point of view and in view of the existing financial stringency they regret that they cannot agree to contribute towards the upkeep of this organisation. With regard to Mr*.

Sir, 1 - 10V 192 I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 0162/117 F.2. of 19th October stating that the Amy Council no longer desire the maintenance of a Military Attache at Tehran and propose to discontinue their contribution to the upkeep of the post as from 1st December next. This decision is stated in your letter to have been taken M in view of the recent appointment of a Military Attache at Tehran”: but the Amy council, it must be presumed, have overlooked the fact that when the appointment of Military Attache at Meshed was first created there was already a Military Attache at Tehran, as there has been continuously since. The object for which the post of Military Attache at meshed was created was the collection of information of occurrences, especially those of military importance, in Russian Central Asia. This remains the primary duty of the Military ✓ AttacheAttache and his, staff, and is a duty which, in the nature of things, cannot satisfactorily be performed from Tehran. The Secretary of State for India was informed by the Government of India in 1910 that* the Chief of the Imperial General Staff has recently adoressed the commander in Chief in India with a view to the General Staff in Irldia assuming entire responsibility for intelligence work in Khorassan**; and in War Office letter to the Treasury of 4th January of the same year it was stated that M the presence of a trained intelligence officer at Meshed constitutes the sole means of obtaining accurate information regarding events on the Northern frontiers of Afghanistan and in c. Asia, and the Council are satisfied as its necessity on military grounds.' i?Tom a telegram from the Commander in Chief, India, to the War Office dated 26th October, copy of which was enclosed in the Memorandum from the Director of Military Intelligence to the Foreign Office of the 3rd November, Mr. Montagu infers that the General Staff in India have been released from the responsibility above-mentioned, while he notes that to inDraft Paper Department. 11 : I A (69265) Wt.

B. &amp; L. in the Memorandum itself the Director of Military Intelligence states that he does not consider that the maintenance of an intelligence establishment at Meshed is essential so far as the War Office is concerned. I am, however, to point out that the defence of India against attack from regions beyond the confines of Afghanistan is admittedly an imperial and not an Indian liability and it is presumably to this consideration that the Commander in Chief’s willingness to close down the establishment of the military Attache at meshed is due. I am therefore to enquire whether it is the considered opinion of the Amy Council that the situation has 30 changed since 1910 that information regarding events in Central Asia -s no longer required for any Military purpose, and, if it is required, from what source it is now proposed to obtain it.

Revenues, and sonsidei tfea: would he mor - c- ui ^ - 011 secure this y sc much ■ betterioFrom 1905 to 1913, as can be seen from the attached file, discussion was in progress as to the creation of a permanent post of Military Attache at Meshed, the importance of the posi;, ius duties, and the incidence of its cost. It may be sufficient for present purposes to say that it was eventually agreed on all hands that unless and until a British Consul was established in Central Asia, Grt.Britain could not forego the means afforded by the postjf of collecting information, particularly military information, as to events in Central Asia and Bussian doings there; that the collection of this information required an elaborate organisation and its collation a trained military officer; and that the results obtained were of value to the Imperial as well as the Indian Government. From 1904-1910 the Foreign Office J contributed a moiety of the salary of the officer acting as Military Attache, but contributed nothing to the cost of the | establishment - without which of course the officer was practically useless. In 1910 the Foreign Office renounced all interest in the post and induced the War Office to accept responsibility for conoribufcing whatever sum might be agreed to represent the Govt 1 s. Imperia]/interest. In 1911 the Treasury agreed on behalf of the War Office to make a fixed contribution of £500 a year for two years at the end of which time the position was to be reviewed. The total annual cost was then accepted as roughly £2000 a year. In 1912 i;he Govt, of India recommended the retention of the post, the cost of which they undertook to reduce to £1800 per annum and they suggested that this should be shared by India to the extent of 11/18, by War Office to^and by Foreign Office ^0^ The economy of £200 was however only attained by cutting 1,100 o-i-j. the expenditure on the collection of information - the raison d^tre of the post. The Secretary of State in Council accordingly decided to sanction the annual cost as £1900 and he succeeded in inducing the War Office to contribute% Minute Paper. Department. contribuUe from 1st April 1913, a fixed sum of £950, which was in fact a moiety of the whole cost as then e estimated. For a more detailed account of the question, attention « is invited to the papers flagged D.E.F.and G., more 7 especially E for a statement of the case, as it stood in 1910, for the retention of the post. It should he noted from the papers marked F, that the Government of * India were only able to keep the cost of the post within the limity of £1900 a year by arranging that it should be held by a Captain G.S.O.II, having for establishment only a clerk and chuprassie. (The first subsequent incumbent had to agree to forego the increase of emoluments due on attaining his majority - an arrangement possible only in special individual cases.) After the outbreak of war certain irregularities in the following out of the arrangements of 1913 began to / occur. First, Major Marsh, the then AttacheAvas transferred early as in 1914 to establish liaison with the Russian Army in the Caucasus, and his vacancy was apparently not filled till the early part of 1916 when Lieut.Col.Redl was sent to Meshed. (Note that a o * 9 * ° Lieutenant Colonel, G.3.0.I, not a Captain / was sent). Nevertheless the War Office regularly paid their contribution of £950 per annum. In 1918 when the 'Malleson Mission' was sent to Meshed and began operating in Trans-Caspia and Turkestan, the Military Attache with his establishment was apparently absorbed into the Head^ Qaurters of the Mission as the Intelligence Branch, and was retained in that position till the last of the Mission was 2503 3000 10.20 withdrawnflu withdrawn in March 1921. The War Office nevertheless paid their contribution of £950 for the Attache uili 1919-20 inclusive. Since then they have declined to pay till the question of the incidence of expenditure on the Malleson Mission is settled. The Government of India now wish to reconstitute the post of Military Attache at Meshed. As to the wisdom of retaining an Intelligence organisation to collect information regarding Turkestan and Trans-Caspia, there can be no question. Gt.Britain is even less likely now than in 1910 to obtain permission to establish a Consulate at Tashxenu or other town in Russian Central Asia, and even if one were established the collection of information of the sort obtained by the Military Attache is no part x of a Consul’s legitimate functions; nor, if it were, would Russia alio?/ him to execute it. A consulate established in H.Afghanistan would be equally hampered. Meshed is obviously the best place now as before the war, for the collection of intelligence over all the area west of that reached from Kashgar. But the post-war organisation is on a very different scale from that sanctioned in 1913: x e.f.

Department. .#■ - It may be that in view of the scarcity of intelligence from other parts of Russia^ Asiatic possessions, the Foreign Office may now be led to acknowledge an interest in the Military Attache’s work; the Director of Military Intelligence may be relied upon to do so. But it is certain that neither the Foreign Office nor the War Office will agree to participate in expenditure on the scale proposed without much more information as to &amp;he necessity of each item. They probably will not quarrel with the higher rank of the incumbent; they are not likely to dispute the cost of the Wireless Telegraph installation and personnel (for it has been ascertained that under modern conditions this is recognised by the Director of Military Intelligence at least as an essential part of the equipment of the Military Attache at Meshed); nor will anyone object to the provision in present circumstances of the means for rapid evacuation. But there remain several items towards which a contribution cannot be asked of Imperial Revenues with any prospect of success without further elucidation. ’o-' nL-&lt; ' h ^ A—^ -i ^ Lh\ ^ i 11 — Sc ^u . ^ c ^ ,c V u^f Z'S hD r-to (/\_ (21 2503 3000 10.20 Sr** u* ~4CkhT,^~ \^^S/yy^L / ^ 74^+~s/Ji~s{aA£ a* Q ^-y t cK^rr^^j/y /v'S*' /ft' 27^ P. /^ 4 *’G.E.S/AS 4433 GQEL m From Dated itec ! d&lt; Viceroy^ Army Depto c to B 0 of So for India EletoAprilaiggl, ! ] 4opm„ 21st Apr ilj, 1921 o2 t 2 1 Priority A 632 o 20/4„ Your 1799.

Sir ^ I am directed to refer to War Office letter 0162/108 (F.l.) datod 16th May, 1913, agreeing to pay from Army funds a fixed contribution of £950 p§r annum towards the cost of the appointment of Military Attache at Meshed. This amount represented one half of the estimated cost to the Indian Government of maintaining^officerfl at this station and the basis of division purported to correspond with the interests of the Imperial and Indian Government* in the appointment. At the outbreak of war the appointment was held by Major (now temporary Colonel) F.G. Marsh, 0th Gurkha Rifles ? but subsequently he was attached to the Russian Forces operating in Armenia. Notwithstanding the change in Colonel Marsh’s duties the orimnal arrangement under which half oi the cost of his appointment at Meshed was borne by Army Funds continued and payments at the rate of £950 per annum have regularly been made by this office to your Department. This was on the assumption that in addition to the duties performed for the War Office in Armenia, Major Marsh still continued to discharge duties for the Indian Government corresponding with those in respect of which half the cost of his appointment was borne by Indian funds. Colonel Marsh has now been withdrawn ©ftlaccount of ill health and it is proposed to appoint Major G.D.Pike,^M.C., 9th Gurkha Rifles as Military Agent in the Caucas us in his place. Apart from any considerations arising in connection with Meshed this appointment would be a British one,entitling the holder to the British Staff rate or in the_case of Major Pike the rate appropriate to his last substantive Indian appointment if more advantageous to him, but ^ it is not entirelv clear to this Office^ that in succeeding Golonel Marsh Major Pike will not be in a position to render to the Indian Government the same kind of assistance as that furnished by ''•f! Colonel Marsh. If this shouM be so, there would appear ,0 be no reason why Manor Pike should not be paid by the Indian -government and one hair of the cost (not exceeding psr annum) be contributed by the Imperial^Government m^accordance with the arrangements regarding the Military Attacne at Meshed. , - if on the other hand the^ interest of the Indian Government in the continuance of the Meshed appointment hao ceased and if it is considered that the special interests of the Indian Government are not served by the maintenanceeof a Military Attache Q)n the Caucasus the anntiiaal contribution from Army bunds should be discontinued.

With reference to your letter 1259 of 6th February 1911, In which the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury sanctioned the continuance of the post of Intelligence Officer at Meshed for a period of two years, I am commanded to acquaint you, for Their Lordships' information, that the Army Council concur in the opinion expressed in India Office letter dated 12th February 1913 (copy enclosed with Foreign Office letter to Treasury dated 26th February 1913) as to the continued necessity for this appointment on military grounds. / The Imperial contribution toward the cost (up wards of £2,000 a year) during the last two years has been a fixed sum of £500 a year, chargeable to Array Funds. e Secretary, The Treasury. The India Office now urge that the cost should be squally divided between Imperial end Indian revenues, as previously recommended in War Office letter of 6th February 1911. In making that recommendation the ArmyArray Council contemplated the further division of the Imperial share between the War Office and the Foreign Office. The Foreign Office, however, disown all dip lomatic interest in the appointment, and in view of the ruling in Treasury letter dated 6 th Fqdi uapy 1911, that the total contribution from Imperial funds should fall on Army Votes, and of the opinion expressed in Foreign Office letter of 26th February 1913, the Coun cil do not wish to press this point further. T hey are therefore willing to pay out of Art Jotm such fixed contribution as Their Lordships ray be pleased to determine, not exceeding £950 a year (being half the total future cost as estimated in India nff ci letter of 12th February 1913). The. Council agree with the India Office and the Foreign Office that the title of the officer should in future be that of '/i1itary Attache , I am &amp;c., (Signed) F.W.D. Ward.Sir: - I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury your letter of the 14th instant Military Attache at Meshed. (0162/105) relative to the permanent appointment of a In reply I am to state that, in view of the con currence of opinion expressed by the Army Council and the India Office, My Lords assent to this proposal; and, on the understanding that the Council consider the expenditure to be fully justified on grounds of \ Pritish Military advantage. They will offer no further objection to an increase of the Imperial con tribution to a sum, chargeable to Arm,'/ Votes, not ex ceeding £950 per annum (being half the total future cost of the post in question as estimated in India Office letter of 12th February last). I am to add that a copy of your letter and this reply thereto have been sent to the foreign Office. I am &amp;c.. (Signed) T.L. Heath. Secretary, War Office. IftlAs regards the future, it will be seen that the ordinary charges connected with the maintenance of the post are estimated by the Govern ment of India at Rs. 31,953 = 2.130L, when the incumbent holds the rank of major. In your letter of 30th September 1909, Sir E. Grey expressed the opinion that the expenditure contemplated was neither in accordance with precedent nor with the requirements of the post of Military Attache, and that the proposal to charge one-ha If to the Imperial Exchequer was subject to grave and insuperable objection. Lord Morley ventures to hope that, on further consideration, Sir E. Grey will mitigate the severity of that judgment. The question of pre cedent has been dealt with by the Government of India. As regards the requirements of the post, it will be seen that the bulk of the expenditure is due not to the personal requirements of the officer, but to the nature of his duties. These duties involve the employment of an elaborate and necessarily somewhat expensive organisation, without which information can neither be obtained nor corroborated, and the Government of India are of opinion that any material reduction can only be effected at the expense of general efficiency. In this opinion Lord Morley concurs, with the exception that he thinks that the duties of the post could be adequately discharged by an officer with the rank of captain. By this reduction there would be a saving of about 190b per annum, and the maximum cost might be put roughly at 2 , 000 b per annum. During the six years that have passed since the appointment was first proposed, the question of its maintenance has been examined from every point of view, with the result that the Army Council, the Govern ment of India, two Commanders-in-Chief in India, and three distinguished officials who have held the posts of Minister or Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, have been unanimous in recommending it—so long, at all events, as there are in Central Asia no British Consular officers from whom the same information might be obtained, though probably at greater expense. This recommendation was accepted in principle by Sir E. Grey in Foreign Office letter to the Treasury above quoted. Lord Morley fully shares Sir E. Grey’s desire for a substantial reduction in the cost of the Indian Consular establishments in Persia, and the question has for some time been under examination by the Government of India. His Lordship has reason to believe that their proposals will include a reduction of about Rs. 40,000 (2,666b) in the cost of the Meshed Consulate after providing for the Native Agent at Turbat-i-Haidari, where, as Sir E. Grey is aware, the Consulate has been abolished. In view of this important fact, and of the considerations urged above, Lord Morley earnestly trusts that Sir E. Grey will now move the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, to sanction, as a per manent measure, the payment of half the cost of the appointment of Military Attache, subject to a maximum of 2,000b per annum. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, Colin G. Campbell. Enclosure No. 2. Foreign Office to India Office. Foreign Office, 12th October 1910. I am directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2 nd ultimo on the subject of the Military Attache or Intelligence Officer at Meshed, suggesting that the post should now be made permanent and that the cost of the officer’s salary and of the contingent expenses should be borne equally by the Indian and Imperial Exchequers. rI am to state that, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, the post of Intelligence Omcer at Meslied is maintained principally for Indian, and indirectly only for Imperial, interests. This principle is admitted in the third paragraph of the War Office letter of 16th September 1908, copy of which has been forwarded to you in the Persian Confidential Print. Sii L, Grey consideis it indisputable that the Indian military authorities dern e most advantage fiom the information supplied, and he is therefore strongly of opinion that the share at present borne by the Imperial Government, viz., one half the pay of the officer, is a fair payment for the benefits received by them, and that if their contribution were to be extended to the contingent and other expenses, they would be paying more than they could legitimately be required to do/ I am to request that you will submit these considerations to Viscount Morley, adding that Sir E. Grey finds himself unable to apply to the Treasury for sanction to make any contribution over and above that already authorised ; but that he is prepared to support an application that the post should be maintained for a further period. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State Louis Mallet. for India. Enclosure No. 3. India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, Sir, 18th October 1910. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, No. 32,081, on the subject ol the Military Attache at Meshed, and to say that he learns with satis faction that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is prepared to support an application for the further maintenance of the appointment. As regards the incidence of cost, while recognising the force of the reference that Sir E. Grey makes to the opinion expressed by the Army Council in 1908, Viscount Morley desires to call especial attention to the statement made in paragraph 3 of the Government of India’s letter No. 67, of 7th July 1910 (which was one of the enclosures in Mr. Camp bell’s letter of 2nd September), that “ the Chief of the Imperial General “ Staff has recently addressed the Commander-in-Chief with a view to “ the General Staff in India assuming entire responsibility for intelli- “ gence work in Russian Turkestan, a proposition which His Excellency “ could only accept on the supposition that the services of a Military “ Attache at Meshed will be permanently retained.” In Lord Morley’s opinion this fact greatly strengthens the Indian claim that half the total expenditure on the appointment should be borne by Imperial funds, since a direct responsibility is now laid upon the Government of India, a responsibility, moreover, which even the permanent appointment of a Military Attache will not enable them to discharge unless the organi sation, without which the officer is useless, be sanctioned as well. I am to suggest that the views of the Army Council should be invited on this aspect of the question, and to express the hope that after consultation with them Sir Edward Grey will find himself able to accept the proposal made in Mr. Campbell’s letter above quoted. As the period for which the appointment w r as temporarily sanctioned expires on the 20 th instant, I am to ask lor the lavour of an early reply. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. I have, &amp;c., R. Ritchie.! ; I ■ r Foreign Office, Sir, 2nd November 1910. I am directed by tbe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to reier to previous correspondence with your Department ending with your letter of 16th September 1908, on the subject of the post of Military Attache at Meshed. 1 am to transmit to you, for the infor mation of the Army Council, the enclosed copy of correspondence which ensued on that letter between this Department, the India Office, and the Treasury, from which it will be seen that the latter, in view of the Imperial interests involved, consented to the charge on the Imperial revenues of one half the expenditure involved, which at that period was given as amounting in ail to live hundred and seventy- iour.pounds eight shillings (574L 8s.), seven hundred pounds (TOOL), or nine hundred and twenty-seven pounds four shillings (927L 4s.), according to the rank of the officer employed. This sanction was in accordance with the usual procedure adopted for the adjustment of expenditure on 14is Majesty s Diplomatic and Consular Establishments m 1 ersia, whereby such expenditure is equally shared between the Indian and Imperial Exchequers, the latter’s share being debited to the Foreign Office Vote. In a subsequent letter of IGth September 1909 (copy also enclosed) the India Office brought to the notice of this Department further contingent expenses connected with the post, bringing the total expen- dituie for the year 1909—10 up to two thousand three hundred and seventy-two pounds (2,372L), and it was suggested that the sanction of the Treasury should be sought to charging a moiety of these contingent expenses, as well as of the paj 7 of the Military Attache, against British revenues. To this step Sir E. Grey, for reasons set forth in the reply to the India Office letter, felt himself unable to assent. In further correspondence, of which 1 am to transmit to you copies, the India Office have again reverted to this subject, and have adduced aiguments in layour of reversing this decision. From a perusal of this conespondence the Army Council will see that, in the view of the Government of India, it is wrong to regard this post as coming under the airangement mentioned above, by which a general sharing of expenditure in Persia is contemplated. The residence of the MilitaryAttcicliG, 01 , as they would prefer to designate him, the Intelligence Officer, in Meshed is incidental, and due to the fact that neither he nor any British Consular Officer can reside in Russian Turkestan. It is entirely in Russian territory that his work lies, and his raison d’etre is unconnected with Persia or Persian affairs. It is argued that for these reasons the expenditure, high as it is as compared with that involved on Military Attacheships in other parts of the world, is justifiable, and that, in view of the Imperial interests involved, it should be shared in its entirety with the Imperial Exchequer. I am to point out that, in supporting the previous application to the Treasury for sanction to pay a moiety of the salary of the Meshed Intelligence Officer, Sir E. Grey had in view the arrangement for the general sharing of Persian Diplomatic and Consular Establishments rather than a correct appreciation of the nature of the post. He has accepted the view put forward by the Army Council and other com petent authorities that the retention of the appointment is of value, at any rate indirectly, to Imperial interests; but he has also felt convinced that the share hitherto borne by the Imperial Exchequer has been fully commensurate to the benefits received, and he has declined to approach the Treasury with a view to increasing the sum at present contributed. The Despatches enclosed and the arguments adduced in the India Office letters of the 2nd September and 18th October emphasise the purely military character of the post; but so far from furnishing Sir E. Grey with any new reason why the share of the expense hitherto borne on the estimates of this department should be increased, they have rather led him to question whether the appointment in future should not rather be treated on the same footing as Military Attacheships in other parts of the world. In this view he is confirmed by the fact emphasised in the India Office letter of the 18th instant that the Imperial General Staff have addressed the Commander-in-Chief in India with a view to the General Staff in India assuming entire responsibility for intelligence work in Russian Turkestan. Sir E. Grey therefore feels that only the Army Council can fully estimate precisely to what extent the post of Intelligence Officer at Meshed is of value to Imperial interests, and that they are therefore alone able to recommend to the Treasury what share, if any, of the expenditure connected with the post should be borne by the Imperial Exchequer. I am therefore directed by Sir E. Grey to inquire what view the Army Council takes as to whether the post should be further temporarily retained or permanently established ; and I am to suggest that if they favour its retention they should enter into an arrangement with the India Office for an equitable sharing of the expenditure involved. I am to add that the period for which the retention of the post was sanctioned in 1908 expired on the 20th instant, but that the Lords Com- missioners of the Treasury have sanctioned its continuance on the present footing till 31st December next pending a full discussion of the amount and incidence of the expenses attaching to the post.

They are further of opinion that the Government of India should bear half the total cost (2,130k per annum), of the appointment. Such a division of cost follows the precedent of the Robat detachment (Treasury letter No. 6061, dated 2nd May 1907), and is in general accord with the principles recommended by Lord Welby’s Commission in 1900, as to the partition of charges between the Indian and the Imperial Exchequers in cases of expenditure in connection with that part of Central Asia which is adjacent to the borders of India or Afghanistan. (Paragraph 307 of Report). As regards the division of the Imperial share of the cost between the Foreign Office and this Department, it appears to the Council that, as a source of reliable information not otherwise available to the ForeignxO Office, the post cannot fail to be of considerable diplomatic as well as military value. On the whole, the Council are of opinion that the interest ol the War Department in the appointment would be adequately represented by a contribution of 500b a year, and that the balance of the Imperial share should fall on Foreign Office Votes. On this basis tiie Imperial u diplomatic ” value of the post would be assessed at about one-fourth of the whole cost. If this proposal meets witli^ their Lordships’ approval, provision will be made in next year’s Army Estimates accordingly. The arrangement might be reviewed at the end of two years from 1 st instant.

I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 10 th instant, forwarding copy of a letter from the War Office relative to the permanent appointment of an intelligence officer at His Majesty’s Consulate-General at Meshed, and to state that Sir E. Grey is willing, if the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury so decide, that half the salary attached to this post should continue to be a charge on Foreign Office votes, though he considers that it would be preferable that the share of all expenses incurred under this head which is defrayed from Imperial sources should fall on the War Office alone. The view originally adopted by Sir E. Grey on this question was that the maintenance of the post was a matter in no sense of Imperial but purely of Indian interest, and though he was led partially to recede from this principle in deference to the representations made by the Secretary of State for India and to the opinion expressed by the Army Council that the continued existence of such an officer was of importance from an Imperial standpoint, he still considers that the Imperial interest served thereby is of a purely military as distinct from a diplomatic character.I am further to observe that the cost of Military Attaches in general constitutes a charge on the War Office, with the sole exception of the case at Tehran, where the Military Attache, for special reasons, is paid by this Department. Sir E. Grey entirely agrees with the opinion expressed by the Lords Commissioners that any Imperial contribution made under this head in excess of half the officer’s pay should be subject to a maximum limit.

Their Lordships direct me to state that they have carefully considered the correspondence in the matter, and note that on the one hand the Army Council assess the interest of the War Department in the appoint ment at not more than 500L a year, and that on the other Sir Edward Grey still considers that the Imperial interest js of a purely military character, although he would be willing, if their Lordships should so desire, that half the salary of the post should continue to be borne on Foreign Office votes. In these circumstances, while attaching due importance to the view expressed by Sir E.

Sir: - With reference to your letter 1259 of 6th. February 1911 on the subject of the permanent appointment of a Military Attache or Intelligence Officer, at His Majesty’ Consulate General at Meshed, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Lords Commissioners of fils Majesty’s Treasury, a copy of a letter from the India Office on the subject. £ir E. Grey regrets that he is unable to share the opinion expressed by the Marquess of Crewe that the temporary presence of a large body of Russian troons in Khorassan renders the location of a military officer at Hie Majesty’s Consulate General at Meshed desirable for diplomatic reasons. On the contrary, he adheres entirely to his view expressed in my letter of 19th. January 1911 that the Imperial interest served by the presence I he b ec ret ary to the Treasury.i m presence of such an officer is of a purely military distinct from a diplomatic character. Their Lordships concurred in this view and stated that the Imperial contribution towards the upkeep of the post should be paid from Army funds. Sir iJi. Grey considers that the whole question is one to be discussed between the India Office and the har Office, (to both of which Departments copies of this letter are being sent) and that it does not appear any longer to concern this Department, except as regards the designation of the officer in question. As regards that point dir .6. Grey agrees with Lord Crewe that the title of such an officer in Meshed should be that of “Military Attache” rather than that of “Intelligence Officer”. I am &amp;,c., (bigned)SECRET. No. 193 of 1912. To The MOST HONOURABLE THE MARQUIS OF CREWE, K.G., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 28th November 1912. My Lord Marquis, We have the honour to address Your Lordship with regard to the continuance of the appointment of Military Attache, Meshed, as requested in Viscount Morley’s despatch No. 21-Political, dated the 17th March 1911. 2. In His Excellency the Viceroy’s telegram of the 20 th June 1911, it was ^ suggested that, having regard to the state of affairs in Central Asia, and to the possibility of a British Consulate being located in Russian Turkistan, it was unnecessary to retain a Military Attache at Meshed. We, therefore, proposed that the appointment should be abolished, and that the Consul-General should carry on the intelligence work of the Military Attache in addition to his own. Your Lordship decided, however, that it would be premature to abolish this appoint ment until the Russian Government expressed its willingness to accept a British Consul at some place in Central Asia which would be suitable from a military point of view. This decision was communicated to us in Your Lordship’s telegram of the 6th July 1911, in which you invited us -to express our views on the subject more fully by letter. 3. We informed Your Lordship in our telegram of the 16th November 1911, that we proposed to defer giving this expression of our opinion until a settlement had been reached in regard to the establishment of a British Consulate at Tashkent. Since then the latter question has been the subject of considerable correspondence between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg, but the latter’s negotiations in the matter with the Russian Government have so far failed to bring about a settlement. The correspondence forwarded with Foreign Office letter No. 35872-12, dated the 6 th September 1912, and Your Lordship’s letter No. P.-3477, dated the 19th September 1912, in reply y' thereto, show that the Russian authorities are unwilling to allow any foreign consulates being established in Central Asia, and that the proposal to have a British Consulate at Tashkent, or at any other place which would be suitable from a military point of view, may therefore be regarded as impracticable. 4. Apart from this, however, it is clear, from the papers forwarded with Your Lordship’s despatch No. 25, dated the 28th June 1912, that it would now be Y* undesirable, even if His Majesty’s Government were successfuj^p^i^ugm^ theRussian authorities to consent to the appointment of a British Consul at Tash kent, to abolish the post of Military Attache at Meshed. Our only reason for suggesting this measure last year was that we were then under the impression that the Consul-General at that place would be in a position to carry on the in telligence work now performed by the Military Attache in addition to his consular duties. It is evident, however, that this is not the case, for, apart from other reasons which we will refer to presently, it is noted that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has expressed strong objections to Consular Officers being em ployed in the collection of military intelligence. The Consul-General at Meshed is thus precluded from collecting information in regard to the Russian forces in Central Asia, with the result that we must either retain the Military Attache for this purpose, or forego all attempts to keep ourselves informed in regard to matters which vitally afiect the security of India. In these circumstances, and having regard to the fact that Russian Military Attaches, trained in the language schoohat Tashkent, are attached for intelligence duties to the Russian Consulates at Meshed and Sistan, we concur in the views expressed by Sir Edward Grey, and unhesitatingly affirm that the continuance of this appointment is necessary. 5. The conclusion we have thus arrived at is justified by other reasons. The Army Council stated it, as their opinion in 1911, that “ the presence of a trained Intelligence Officer at Meshed constitutes the sole means of obtaining information regarding events in the northern frontiers of Afghanistan, and in Central Asia j and that they were satisfied as to its necessity on military grounds”. Viscount Morley concurred in this view, and in a letter to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, written in 1910, it was stated that “ His Lordship is strongly of opinion that in the absence of any British Consular Officer throughout the whole of Central Asia, it is impracticable on Imperial, no less than on Indian, grounds to dispense with the one trustworthy source of information as to what is taking place in this vast area ”. We would add that, when the Imperial Government put forward proposals in 1910 by which the General Staff in India was to be made entirely res ponsible for intelligence work in Russian Turkistan, His Excellency the Command- er-in-Chief expressly stated that he could only accept this proposition “ on the supposition that the services of a Military Attache at Meshed would be perma nently retained.” 8 . We now find ourselves in complete accord with the views expressed by the various authorities quoted above, and as the continuance of the Meshed Attacheship has been repeatedly advocated, not only by our own immediate pre decessors, but by the Army Council, the late and the present Commanders-in-Chief in India, and three distinguished officials who have held the posts of Minister, Charge d’Affaires at Teheran, we recommend that the appointment be now made permanent. 7 7. As regards the financial aspects of the case, we concur in the opinion ex pressed by Viscount Morley in 1910 as to the desirability of restricting the ap pointment in the case of future incumbents to officers not above the rank of captain and of changing the designation of the post from Military Attache to Intelli gence Officer. By doing this, and by substituting staff pay at Rs. 400 a month, as authorized for a General Staff Officer, 2nd Grade, for the deputation allowance of Rs. 15 a day now admissible, a saving of about £ 200 a year could be effected, reducing the total cost of the appointment and the establishment attached theretoto about £ 1,800, instead of about £2,000 a year as at present. We are of opinion that the total expenses connected with the post should be divided between the Indian and Imperial Exchequers, in accordance with the principles enunciated by Lord Welby’s Commission in 1901 for the partition of charges connected with that part of Central Asia, which is adjacent to the borders of India or Afghanistan. But to avoid a repetition of the lengthy discussions which have already taken place between the India Office, the Foreign Office, the War Office and the Treasury, in regard to the apportionment of charges relating to this appointment, we would suggest that a settlement of the matter might be arrived at on the basis of India paying £1,100, the War Office £500, and the Foreign Office £200 of the £1,800 which will represent its total annual cost. We consider that such an arrangement would be equitable and satisfactory, as the War Office has already acknowledged that its interest in the post would be fairly represented by a contribution of £500 a year, while the change in the situation resulting from the occupation of Khora- san by Russian troops, and the consequent necessity for having an officer, quali fied as a Russian interpreter, attached to the Meshed Consulate, disposes of most of the arguments which were adduced by the Foreign Office in 1910 in order to justify its claim to exemption from sharing in the cost of this appointment. 8. We attach a statement showing the cost of the appointment under existing conditions, and what it would be if the proposals put forward in this despatch are concurred in. We have the honour to be, My Lord Marquis, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble Servants, (Signed)^ 7 G. FLEETWOOD WILSON. „ HARCOURT BUTLER. R. H. CRADDOCK.SECRET.

The supply of military information should form no part of the Consul’s duties, and Sir E. Grey considers that he should, on the contrary, carefully abstain from making any communication of the kind to the Military Attache and from any relations with the agents employed by the latter. It would indeed even be preferable that the Consul should not know who these agents are and should remain in ignorance of the sources from which the Attache obtains his information. The Under Secretary of State for India. I am, &amp;c., Louis Mallet. Annex 1. Extract of Despatch from Lieutenant-Colonel A. Knox, No. 15, dated 28th May 1912. In November last I prepared notes on points regarding which information would be of value, and distributed copies to Consuls. All have been most willing to help, but the result is disappointing. Ihe Consuls at Moscow, Nikolaev, Kharkov, and Sevastopol have stated in identical terms that they have found it impossible to obtain any infor mation, for officers and officials who know anything are constantly on their guard. The only consular officers who have contributed to the few notes which I attach are Mr. Waite, who has been 18 years in the office of the Consul-General at Odessa, and Mr. Consul Stevens, who has served 16 years at Batum. I suggest that the experience proves how little military information could be expected from a British Consul at Tashkent, and how dangerous it might be in certain eventualities to tiust to him. alone.Annex 2. Foreign Office to Director of Military Operations. No. 23,437. The Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Director of Military Operations and is directed by Secretary Sir Edvvard Grey to transmit to him herewith a despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at St, Petersburg, forwarding a report from the Military Attache to His Majesty’s Embassy which gives information on various military matters. Brigadier-General Wilson will observe that, at the beginning of this report, Lieutenant-Colonel Knox states that in November last he pre pared notes on points regarding which information would be of value, and distributed copies to Consuls, but that, in spite of the willingness of the latter to help, the result has been disappointing. Colonel Knox draws from this fact the conclusion that little assistance of this nature could be expected from a British consular officer at Tashkent, should such a one be appointed as the result of the negotiations now in progress with the Russian Government. Sir A. Nicolson is to state that it is, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, undesirable and moreover contrary to the existing rules of the service that the Military Attaches to His Majesty’s Missions abroad should, on their own initiative, make use of British consular officers for the purpose of obtaining information of this kind which forms no part of the hatters’ duties. These officers can only do so by making enquiries of local officials which cannot fail to arouse suspicion or by enlisting the services of agents of doubtful character who are more likely than not to be at the same time in the pay of the local authorities, with the result that the transaction is quickly brought to the knowledge of the latter, and the consular officers are consequently discredited and their legitimate usefulness impaired. It is moreover evident from Colonel Knox’s despatch that recourse to this method of seeking information cannot be expected to produce any useful result. It has already been found necessaiy by means of circular instruc tions to His Majesty’s Representatives abroad, to call attention to unauthorized proceedings of a similar kind, and Sir A. Nicolson is to request that Military Attaches may be reminded that their action in the countries to which they are appointed must be restricted to the carrying out of the instructions, whether general or special, which they may receive from or through the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and that British consular officers are not authorized to act on any directions except such as reach them either from the Foreign Office or from His Majesty’s Ambassadors or Ministers. Sir A. Nicolson is at the same time to forward copy of a letter to the India Office discussing the bearing of Colonel Knox’s observations relative to the British Consul at Tashkent on the question of the main tenance of a Military Attache to His Majesty’s Consulate General at Meshed.

The Consuls at Moscow, Nikolaev, Kharkov, and Sevastopol have stated in identical terms that they have found it impossible to obtain any inform ation, for officers and officials who know anything are constantly on their guard.

I suggest that the experience proves how little military information could be expected from a British Consul at Tashkent, and how dangerous it might be in certain eventualities to trust to him alone. Aviation .—No aeroplanes have been yet distributed to air companies. Report says that there are two aeroplanes at Kars, but these have been probably sent there on account of expected trouble with Turkey. Air companies are said to be commanded by a lieutenant-colonel, with a captain, five lieutenants, and a secretary. The officers are not necess arily engineers but are volunteers from various branches of the service. The number of rank and file is not known. The eighth Air Company at Sevastopol is only equipped with balloons. It is merely a cadre at present containing a captain, two lieutenants, and a few men. Five officers received certificates as pilot from the Odessa Aero Club in 1911. There are at present six civilian and ten officer pupils under instruction. The club possesses two Farman biplanes, three Antoinette, two Bleriot, and one Khioni monoplanes. The Khioni machine is the invention of the club instructor. It was stated at Sevastopol that the new school at Kacha, half way to the Alma, will be reserved for military aviation, that officers would first take their certificates as pilots at the old school and then go to Kacha for military instruction, that the school on the Balacklava Road would have 40 aeroplanes and the new school about half that number. This is contradicted by the recent announcement of the President of the Air Fleet that the whole school will be transferred to Kacha by the commencement of the coming winter. In the last four months some 15 to 20 Nieuport and Bristol aeroplanes have been received at Sevastopol. Five hydroplanes have also arrived, and it is said that it is intended to establish a separate naval school. There are said to be 26 aeroplanes at Gachina and six at Vladi vostok. Of the latter number two are of Russian make and unreliable.Territorial Connection of Unitk.—lt is difficult to find out to what extent the territorial system is actually in working. Each regiment is called after a place, but the connection is purely sentimental, and the name is no indication of the district from which the recruits are drawn. In my Communication No. 22, of the 25th February 1912, I stated that the guiding principle is to distribute recruits to units in peace in such a manner that on mobilisation when all regiments are raised to war strength by absorbing the nearest reservists, each unit will have roughly 6 t) per cent, of Russian and 33 per cent, of non-Russian race. This is undoubtedly true, but I think that there must be exceptions to the symmetrical system described by Carlowitz-Maxen. Consul Stevens denies that there is any territorial connection, and states that the local regiment at Batum contains men from all parts of Russia. The Chief of the General Staff refused to give me any information on the subject. General Monkevitz told me that regiments in frontier districts, where there is a non-Russian population which is subject to conscription, are affiliated to recruiting districts in Russia proper and draw from them the bulk of their recruits. Such districts are Yilna (ah), Warsaw (all), Kiev (parti} 7 ), Odessa (partly), and the Caucasus. In other districts there is no territorial connection and a larger propor tion of the recruits are drawn from non-Russian subject races. Such districts are those of St. Petersburg, Moscow, and Kazan. Districts where there are few if any local reservists to draw on on mobilisation, such as Turkestan, Omsk. Irkutsk, the Pri-Amur, and the Finland part of the St. Petersburg Military District, are also without territorial connection, and draw a large number of their recruits in peace from non-Russian races. General Monkevitz denied the existence of the so-called “ secondary recruiting districts,” and I think he was probably telling the truth. The Russian authorities are fully cognisant of the danger of trusting the subject races, and it seems unlikely that they would allocate year after year a solid contingent of recruits drawn from a single district in Poland or the Caucasus to any single unit. I believe 'that racially unreliable elements are mixed up as much as possible on instructions from St, Petersburg. The bulk of the Poles go to the Caucasus and the Caucasians go to Poland, Odessa Jews and Letts and Lithuanians go to the Far East or Turkestan. Mobilisation.- 1.he estimates of the time required to mobilise vary and are probably of no great value. In Odessa it is thought that units could complete to war strength in men and transport in less than a week, in the Caucasus a fortnight to three weeks are considered necessary. There are stores of clothing at eac!&gt; regimental headquarters to equip reservists on joining, but many of the articles, epecially the boots, are too old to stand the strain of a campaign. However, stores generaliv are now believed to be in a better state than formerly. Transport.—Officers at_ Odessa state that the regimental transport is complete in store, but this is not believed, and my informant thinks that only about 60 per cent, of it is in existence. A large quantity of new transport, chiefly two-wheeled carts, have been lately supplied to Kharkov. Artillery. 'The extra guns required on mobilisation by batteries on the lower peace establishment are stored at brigade headquarters. I he technical transport and harness required for ammunition columns are also said to be ready. Political.—In the event of war with the Central Powers, if Rumania were neutral, one army corps, probably the 8 th, might be moved northut once from the Odessa military district. Its place would be taken by the 7th Corps, which might follow as soon as reserve units had been formed to provide the local garrisons. Provided Turkey were neutral, the Caucasus could spare the doth Division, lately detached from the Kazan Military District, but the three Caucasian army corps it is considered would be held back to look after the local population till reserve units had been formed to take their place.

India Office, 2 nd September 1910. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to address you, with reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No. 34,836 of 30th September 1909, on the subject of the permanent appointment of an intelligence officer at Meshed. The proposal was fully discussed in Sir A. Godley’s letter of 8 th July 1908, and in Sir F. A. Campbell’s letter of 21st September 1908, the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury were informed that “ Sir e! “ Grey considers that there can be no question of objecting to the charge “ on Imperial funds of one-half of the expense involved.” After some further correspondence their Lordships agreed to the appointment “ for “ a period of two years on the understanding that the question of its “ continuance will be considered at the end of that period.” (Sir G. Murray’s letter of 11 th November 1908.) The period in question expires on 20th October next, and Viscount Morley trusts that Sir E. Grey will now be willing to press the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury to agree to place the appointment upon a permanent footing. I am to enclose copy of a letter that has been received from the Government of India on the subject (Secret, No. 67 of 7th July 1910), and to say that His Lordship concurs in the views therein expressed. He is strongly of opinion that in the absence of any British Consular officer throughout the whole of Central Asia, it is impracticable, on Imperial no less than on Indian grounds, to dispense with the one trustworthy source of information as to what is taking place in a vast area which is, moreover, not open to the unrestricted movements of foreigners. Turning to the question of expenditure, I am to correspondence with the Government of India dealing raised in your letter of 30th September 1909. Lord Morley agrees generally with the remarks of the Government of India as to the desi nation and duties of the intelligence officer at Meshed, who would, in his opinion, be better so described than by the somewhat misleading title of Military Attache. The question whether the expenditure is excessive should therefore, he thinks, be considered on its merits, without reference to that incurred on dissimilar appointments elsewhere. According to the information now furnished, the expenditure up to 21st October 1908 was as follows :— Rs. 1904- 05 _ - - - 14,550 1905- 06 - - - 10,771 1906- 07 - - - - 31,155 1907- 08 - - - 29,229 1st April to 21st October 1908 - 20,001 This expenditure has not, up to the present, been included in the annual statements of diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia (vide Notes on Meshed in Enclosure 2 of the letter from this Office of 17th March 1909 and 19th March 1910) ; and, owing to a misapprehension, the Imperial Exchequer has been invited, and has undertaken, to share the pay only (varying from 574k 85 . to 927k 4s. per annum) - e ^- officer holding the appointment. 10387.
