M.’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 281 (2424/143/35), dated the 9th October 1935. The interest evinced in the Hejas by the Banque Misr, particularly in regard to the promotion and development of Egyptian interests in tne annual pilgrimage, have been the subject of report by the Legation from time to' time. The relations established with the Saudi authorities by Talaat Harb Pasha on his visits to this country in the latter end ol both 1933 and 1934, have been maintained, and Sheykh Abdullah Suleyman in spending some time recently in Egypt, on his way to Syria and possibly Turkey, recorded in Jedda Reports for August and September, paragraphs 253 and 286 respectively (F.-92-N./33), is with good reason believed to have been animated by a desire to cultivate those relations still further. 2. That the Minister of Finance has been to some extent successful would appear from the arrival at Jedda on the 1st October by one of tne small vessels of the Socffite Misr de Navigation Maritime now plying m the Red Sea, of a consignment of fifty-four barrels of Shell asphalt f or the purpose of laying down an experimental stretch of road on the mam Jedda- Mecca highway A Greek engineer and an Egyptian, said to represent Talaat Pasha Harb, arrived by the same ship and several days earlier by a Khedivial Mail vessel, a mixing machine for use in road construction was also landed here on behalf of the Banque Misr. . 3 The two representatives of the Egyptian concern have since their arrival, lost no time in getting to work, and operations have already menced outside 'the Medina Gate of Jedda. It is credibly stated that a kilometre of asphalted road will be laid down ^ the e ^P® ns e ° f 9 Misr, except for the labour which is being supplied by the Saudi authoriti. I am confidentially informed by the Manager of Messrs Gellatly Hankey &amp; Co. (Sudan) Ltd., that it is estimated that the cost of laying down the whole Mecca-Jedda road under asphalt would be in the neighbourhood of £45,000, or £1,000 a mile. Mr. Courtenay, who as the representative of the Shell Company here is much interested in this project, also informe me that Signor Odello, the soi-diranl Italian merchant made an effort to induce the Greek engineer to use Italian asphalt instead of the bnell product, but without success. 4.

His Maiesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda presents his compliments to H. E. the Viceroy of India (F. &amp; P.), and has the honour to transmit to him the under-mentioned documents. To Foreign Office, despatch No. 318 of 6th November 1935, regarding' a piastre project in aid of local schools. Enclo. to S. No. (61). Letter from H. M.’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 318, DATED THE 6TH NOVEMBER 1935. I have the honour to inform you that the Mecca newspaper Saut al Heiaz, published on the 29th October a short notice that the leading merchants of Jedda had petitioned the King to sanction a tax of a half piastre miri, about one penny, on every package imported from abroad into the Hejaz, the proceeds to be in aid of the Falah schools of Jedda and Mecca which include, besides a boys school in each town, the girls school of Jedda. The notice announced that the King’s approval had been granted. 2. The Falah schools were founded in 1904 by Hajji Muhammad Ali Zainal Ali Ridha (Alireza), at his own expense except for about eighty thousand rupees subscribed in India for the construction of the school building in Jedda. Until 1931 Hajji Muhammad Ali continued to defray all expenses. Both religious and secular teaching is given in these schools, English being on the syllabus. In Mecca, the teaching staff consists of thirty four, and in Jedda, at the boys school of twenty-four. Pupils in Mecca number some eight hundred and in Jedda, boys only, about seven hundred. Since 1931 the schools have been supported by subscriptions from several local firms and by other charity. It will be remembered that an effort was made during the visit of Talaat Pasha Harb in 1934 to interest him in the girl’s school, but with little success. 3. Owing to the lack of good management and control and also to insufficient funds, the condition of the schools has become so bad, it is said, that the local merchants made an effort to raise a special fund, which i rJ * &gt; &gt; 49 V. J amounted to four thousand riyals (about four hundred pounds) a quarter of which was subscribed once more by the family of Ali Ridha. This sum being insufficient the merchants petitioned the King as mentioned above. 4. The tax which will be collected by the shipping agencies and handed over to a special committee of merchants, has already been enforced for some weeks in Jedda and orders are expected to be sent soon to Yanbu J and Rabegh. This method of collection, independent of the Government, is so alien to this country that, in my opinion, it may soon undergo a change. 5.

M.’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 325 (2774/143/41), dated the 12th November 1935. With reference to my despatch No. 281 (2424/143/35) of the 9th October [Enclo. to S. No. (59)], concerning the activities of the Banque Misr in this country, and more especially their interest in road making, I have the honour to report that the kilometre of asphalt road which it was expected the Banque Misr engineers would lay down as a sample, dwindled in fact to a short stretch of some hundred yards. This was very quickly completed and the Greek engineer left again for Egypt some ten days later. Nothing more having been heard of the Egyptian 'engineer, it is probable that he also has returned home.2. The hundred yards of road lies outside the Medina gate of Jedda on ground which, owing to its firmness, one might mistrust as a reliable test for a road which, if and when constructed will have to pass on its way to Mecca over hills, wadi beds and shifting sands. No special prepara tion, as far as could be seen, was given to the foundation, the land merely being levelled and the asphalt laid. As for cost, it is now said that the estimate for laying the whole Mecca-Jedda road is less than the £45,000 quoted in my despatch under reference, but the exact figure is not known. 3. Talaat Pasha Harb is reported to intend visiting the Hejaz after Ramadhan which ends with the end of December, so the roadway project may then be re-examined and a decision taken whether or not to proceed with the construction of the Mecca road. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the Department of Overseas Trade, His Excellency the Viceroy of India and to His Excellency the High Commissioner, Cairo. (6a) {Received on 8th December 1935, with Political Secretary's letter No. 4, dated the 21st November 1935.) Letter from H. M.’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 277, dated the 8th October 1935. With reference to my despatch No. 227 of the 6th August last [S. No. (57)], relative to the activities of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndi cate (Limited), I have the honour to report that Mr. K. S. Twitchell re turned to Jedda on the 6th October,, after his visit to England, during which he paid a Hying visit to New York. He was accompanied by two Englishmen, Messrs. T. P. Larken and D. L. Gibbs 1 and six Swedes, the latter having engaged, as expert diamond drillers. He informed me shortly after his arrival, that he expects two Americans to join him. within the next few days, and hoped that his machinery would not be long in arriving., 2. Mr. Twitchell and his party have taken up their quarters in a house in the “Legation quarter’’ of the town, which he leased just before leaving here last July. He intends to make the premises his head office in this country. 3. He stated that he would be leaving for the “Cot oif Gold’ in about two or three weeks, and expressed his satisfaction at the preliminary work already accomplished. One of their chief difficulties, he added, would be the question of water supply, and he anticipated that he might have to go some distance to obtain adequate supplies. 4. During Mr. TwitchelTs absence, M. Van de Poll, who has been in general charge, and Mr. Shanks, the Australian, with other memjbers of the personnel, have been active. Mr. Shanks, in particular, has been in charge of road-making operations, along the alignment Jedda-Asfan-A1 Birka-Mahd-Adh Dhahab, to which a reference was made in my despatch under reference at paragraph 8, and in regard to which it is believed con siderable progress has been made. 5.

S. Some relief was afforded early in the year by a further increase i flip number of foreign pilgrims performing the Ha]] in 1935. hot only- did thh figure increase ^from 25,291 in 1934 to 33,898 but an exceptional number of distinguished personages and well-to-do pilgrims visited Heiaz this year, a matter of some point when the general level ot wea t amongst incoming pilgrims has fallen so markedly in these lean year . The beneficent effects of the increase brought comfort to all classes m the Heiaz but complaints were not wanting that the Government had appro- priated to themselves the lion’s share of the pilgrimage harvest, and dis- Tress even amongst merchants, motor-car proprietors and pilgrim-guides, ,11 of whom might have been expected to have benefitted most by a larger pilgrimage was only partially alleviated. Certain foreign companies m 1 p,Th-i however had a more satisfactory year,, upon completing their Sfnts Xr the Hajj, both Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey &amp; Co. (Sudan) Ltd. and Messrs. Sharqieh, Ltd., being able to record some improvement, the latter having achieved a reasonably good profit albeit, according to Mr. Philby. a '‘paper” one. ! 4 Customs receipts form the other main item of Saudi revenue, and during the twelve months under review, these, although no official figures are available, may be expected to have risen in sympathy with the increase in the numbers of pilgrims. Other sources of revenue are of subordinate importance* concessions have not yet commenced to yield steady revenue for operations by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company for the pro duction of oil in Ilasa though promising, have not yet been completely suc cessful and gold-mining operations by the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndi cate upon which I have reported separately, have not yet reached the pro duction stage, though here also there are believed to be grounds for opti- dsm As statistics of any description are, in the absence of official figures Of some interest I give for what they are worth estimates, given in the Egypt u Moderr (presun vement gi*imag what t conditi Protest ernmer firm, T with t soothe ment c dues o early i comme author source the po 120,00 sions, 6 . last, f but m report connec have h shippe paid i 7. been e £1,26: 8 . tain h ment &lt; in the tion o in cas rate b 9 Saudi One s from May, Gover ernmf 1 twelve impos sion t one o63 Egyptian newspaper “A1 Muqattam” and reproduced in the Oriente Moderno” of May, 1935, of the revenues of the Hejaz for “this year (presumably a period ending after the 1935 pilgrimage); £300,000 gold—from pilgrimage. £200,000 gold—from Customs receipts. £100.000 gold—from other sources. £600,000 Total. ' ; ' j i 5. General trading conditions may be said to have shown some impro vement during the period under review. Chiefly owing to the larger pil grimage there have been increased clearances through Customs and a some what better tone in the market. This unfortunately does not mean that conditions can be described as satisfactory, but the tendency is encouraging. Protests were again evoked during the year by the practice of the Gov ernment of importing goods, particularly ride, through one importing firm Messrs. 11aji Abdullah Alireza &amp; Co., to the detriment of others, with the result that some small redistribution of favours was effected to soothe the malcontents. The system adopted by the Saudi Arab Govern ment of settling their local indebtedness by allowing rebates of Customs dues on goods imported was maintained through the j'ear, although in its early months the Government appeared disposed to abandon it. Adverse comment, and perhaps a realisation of the convenience of the system to the authorities themselves, led to a continuance of this practice. From one source it is gathered that the total number of packages to enter through the port of Jedda during the past 12 months was 620,000, of which some 120,000 were for the Saudi Arab Government or foreign diplomatic mis sions, and hence duty free. 6. Exports continued to be negligible (they were estimated in March Last, for the previous twelve months at about eight thousand pounds gola),_ but may be expected during recent days to have received a fillip from the reported purchase of camels from this country by the Italians for purposes connected with the war in Abyssinia, a subject on which separate reports have been submitted. About one thousand camels are said to have been shipped from Yanbu’, though confirmation is still awaited, and the price paid is generally believed to be in the neighbourhood of £15 gold per camel. 7 The visible adverse balance of trade is therefore heavy and has been estimated localtv by a confidential but well-informed source as about £1,261,000 gold for the year 1351 A. H. and £981,000 gold for 1352 A. H. ’ 8. Economy has again been rigidly practised, except perhaps in ce- tain items of Royal expenditure, and once more at the expense ot Govern ment officials, whose salaries, when paid, w e re aiWound Salary reduc- in the early summer steps were taken to eftect an all-round salaiy reauc tffin of twenty-five per cent, two thirds of the now reduced salary to be paid in cash and one-third in kind, the cash payment to be reckoned m gold at a rate highly unfavourable to the official. ' 9 Apart from the system of Customs drafts, described above the Saudi Government are believed to have been able to meet current ^ditie . One signal instance, either of a recognition of the advantages to be den e from a S settlement of debts or of a desire to please may be recorded when in Mav 1935 they repaid the whole of one small debt due to His Majesty s Government and ten per cent, of a larger one due to His Majesty s Gov- ernment and the Government of India. 3 J . 10. Little or no additional taxation has been imposed during the past pWp months except in the case of certain minor matters, such as the imposition of an annual tax of £2 gold on wireless receiving sete perm^ Ton to import and use which, restricted to certain towns of the Hejaz, was one of the notable concessions to Western influences of the }ea .54 11. The history of the period under review as regards currency has been more eventful than in past years. A shortage of silver riyals, proba y in some measure due to hoarding, made itself felt during the summei, w en rates per £ gold showed the following sharp movements. April 1st 21. t June 1st 20. July 1st 1718. July 11th 14^. July 31st 16 8. i August 170 September 18^. A further unusual feature was the importation through Jedda from India by Messrs. Haji Abdullah Alireza, for 'the account of the Saudi Arab Gov ernment, between May and November inclusive, of Rupees 1,630,000; and a further consignment of Rupees 400,000 is shortly expected. Th e reason advanced is that the Rupee is a more convenient coin for use in Nejd than the Maria Theresa dollar, and a more popular one with the tribes than the Saudi riyal. 12. Generally, therefore, it may be said that the tendency to improve ment was maintained throughout the year. Prices of foodstuffs have fluc tuated, in the autumn, under the influences of the uncertainty created ,by the Italo-Abyssinian situation, but the Government took certain steps to restore the position and it is claimed, though with doubtful accuracy, that prices have on the whole returned to normal. Distress is still unfortunately all too prevalent, especially in the city of Medina, but has again been mitigated by charity from a variety of foreign sources. 13.

No. (3)], to the Foreign Office, relative to the training of Yemeni army officers in Iraq, I have the honour to inform you that the Mecca newspaper “Saut-al-Hejaz” of the 19th November contained a brief reference to this subject. No mention was made, however, of the reservation of places in the Military College at Bagdad for cadets from Saudi Arabia. 2. I am sending a copy of this despatch to Bagdad and Aden. ( 6 ) (Received on Ath January 1936, with Political Secretary's letter No. 51, dated 19th December 1935.) Letter from Mr. Cecil Jackson-Craig, to the Foreign Office, dated the 24th November 1935. It is with some trepidation that I dare to address you, but would indeed esteem it a personal favour, if you would kindly give the following, your kind consideration. I desire if possible to secure an appointment in the Near East, either in Arabia or Egypt, preferably Arabia. I have numerous friends in Arabia among the nobles of the various tribes, and take rather a keen interest in the welfare of the Arabian Continent. Doubtless you will appreciate the fact, that I prefer to secure an appointment entirely through my own efforts, and would not dream of ap proaching friends for this purpose. If the Foreign Office can assist me in this matter, either officially or otherwise, believe me I should indeed be grateful. Thanking you in advance for your extreme courtesy, and assuring you dear Sir, that an answer whether in the negative or affirmative, will indeed be more than appreciated. Please believe my sincerity, when I state that I am actuated by the belief, that my services would be of value where Arab tribes are concerned, for between these people and myself, there is a bond of friendship. Enclo. to S. No. (6). Letter from the Foreign Office, to Mr. Cecil Jackson-Craig, No. E.- 6916/6916/65, dated the 11th December 1935. I am directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to acknow ledge the receipt of' your letter of 24th November [S. No. (5)], enquiringas to the possibility of obtaining an appointment in the Near East, and more especially in Arabia or in Egypt. I am to inform you in reply that in so far as the Foreign Office are concerned no such appointments are at present available. 2. Without further information as to your qualifications and experi ence it is difficult to give you any advice in the matter, but I am to explain that applications for appointments in Palestine , Transjordan and the Aden Protectorate should be made through the Colonial Office; for appointments in the Arab States in the Persian Gulf, to the India Office; and for appoint ments in Iraq or Egypt (which are both independent foreign countries) to the Iraqi or Egyptian Legations in London. Vacancies for appointments in any of these countries, are however, rare, and if any were available special qualifications would certainly be required. Appointments for British subjects are seldom or never available in Saudi Arabia.

With reference to your predecessor’s printed despatch No. 46 (E.-561/ 31 /25) of the 23rd February 1933, relative to the anti-Saudi activities o Sheykh Abdur Rauf as-Sabban, I have the honour to inform you that the Umm al Qura of the 26th July announced the return of this individual to this country from Iraq, having been granted a pardon by the King. e had arrived in Mecca and was accompanied by Sheykh Ahmad al Mu;jalhd, having travelled by way of Riyadh where, according to a subsequent para graph he delivered a speech, in the King’s presence, of a laudatory and supplicatory nature. Sheykh Abdur Rauf as-Sabban’s varied past of anti- Saudi intrigue, summarised in Jedda Personalities No 19, wouM, there fore, appear to have been forgiven. Sheykh Ahmad al-Mujallid does not seem to have come so prominently to notice, but he also is described as having been pardoned by Ibn Saud. 2 A similar, but less explicit, reference to Sheykh Abdur ^ uf a PP ear ' ed in the Saut al Hejaz of the 23rd July, which limited itself to the explanation that he was “a Hejazi subject who had stayed for some years at Bagdad the capital of Iraq, our sister country”. 3.

M.’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 339, dated the 26th November 1935. Mr. Calvert to Sir Samuel Hoare.—(Received December 16.) With reference to my despatch No. 277 of the 8th October relative to the activities of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), I have the honour to inform you that the operations of this concern appear to bemaking steady progress. Mr. Twitchell recently informed me that dia mond-drilling, carried out by six Swedish employees of the syndicate, was now proceeding night and day, and that a depth of some 80 feet had been attained. 2. Since my despatch under reference the personnel of the syndicate has been further increased by the arrival of two British employees, Messrs. Punckley and McDermott, the former as manager of the Jedda office and the latter, a son of a director of the syndicate, as a surveyor; of two Ame ricans, one Dutchman, one German and one Greek. Mr. C. L. W. Bindloss, the engineer on the Jedda staff of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), also has now taken up a similar post under the syn dicate. 3. A large quantity of stores, vehicles and machinery, including the diamond drills, have arrived since my despatch under reference, and a great proportion has been successfully transported to the mine, in spite of diffi culties over one stretch of the road Jedda-Asfan-al-Birka-Mahd-adh- Dhahab, on which work is still proceeding. 4. Work is also going on in the construction of houses, built of local stone, at the mine, whilst at Jedda it is reliably stated that the syndicate have acquired an area of some 300 or 400 yards square, about 1 mile north of the towrf colse to the shore, where it is proposed to erect houses for th0 staff, workshops, store-rooms and garages, and it is also projected in due course to construct a pier out to deep water to facilitate the loading and unloading of their materials. 5. According to revised estimates, I should now he disposed to place the mine at roughly 23° 30' N. by 41° E. An unconfirmed statement has reached me that an area of 1 square mile has been granted by the syndicate to a company, perhaps a subsidiary company, formed to prospect and exploit that area. 6. I am sending a copy of this despatch to Transjordan and the De partment of Overseas Trade. &lt; ■ (ii) (Received on 1st February 1936, with Political Secretary's letter No. 3, dated 16th January 1936.) I • j ; ! I ' I ) Letter from H. M.’s Minister Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 355, DATED THE 14th DECEMBER 1935. With reference to Mr. Calvert’s despatch No. 336 of November 25th [S. No. (9)], I have the honour to state that the Umm-al-Qura of Nov- embei 29th published a speech delivered by Muhammad Tahir ad-Dabbagh before King Abdul Aziz at Biyadh. This speech, which is in the nature of a pious recantation of past errors, is not worth reproducing. It may, however, be of interest to record that Tahir ad-Dabbagh was presented to me by Fuad Bey Hamza at the race-meeting at Riyadh at which I was pre sent on November 25th and that he was a guest at the dinners given in my honour by the King and the Crown Prince on that and the following even ing. 2. Fuad Bey was full of mischievous glee when he effected the introduc tion at the races. I told ad-Dabbagh that I was glad to see him back in his own country and hoped he would long remain in it; adding that, if he had come back sooner, he would have saved me a great deal of trouble. He is an egg shaped man of perhaps about 15 with slightly converging eyesand makes no impression of strength. His relative Huseyn ad-Dabbagh is probably hotter stuff and I think there is some disappointment that he has not also returned so far to the Saudi fold. 3. When speaking privately to Faud Bey about the return of Tahir and connected matters, I took an opportunity of impressing on him the seriousness of the efforts made by the British authorities concerned in and after 1932 to curb the activities of persons engaged in anti-Saudi conspira cies abroad. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to Bagdad, Aden and Trans- Jordan. j ( 12 ) (Received on 15th February 1936, with Political Secretary's letter No. 5, dated 30th January 1936.) Enclosure in Foreign Office, covering letter, dated 22nd January 1936. Note on Monsieur Khakimov's 'previous career in Jedda. Kerim Khakimov arrived in Jedda on the 6th August 1924. He is a Tartar from Ufa and a Moslem. He was described by Mr. Consul Bullard as very young for the post (about 31 or 32) but clever and an enthusiastic Communist. He spoke Persian very well, besides Russian, Turkish and Turki and was rapidly learning Arabic and French. After a period of inaction he seems to have indulged in violent anti- British propaganda and lost no opportunity of preaching the mission of the Soviet Union to liberate the East. His activities caused some concern to the authorities in Egypt and the Sudan and His Majesty’s High Com missioner in Cairo suggested that it might be advisable to approach Ibn Saud with a view to the suppression of the Soviet Agency. The Acting British Agent, however, expressed the view that M. Khakimov’s propa ganda was ineffective, that his drunkenness and general behaviour were such as to warn off all but the most stupid and that it would! therefore be inadvisable to act on the High Commissioner’s suggestion. M. Khakimov left Jedda on leave in October 1927. In reporting his departure, Mr. Consul Stonehewer-Bird stated that it was unlikely that he would return. He was unfit to stand the climate and was unable to do anything in moderation. He either drank himself into a nervous break down or was a teetotaller. Owing to the mishandling of a Soviet trade “push” by the Charg6 d’Affaires, M. Khakimov was recalled to. Jedda in February 1928. He was worried and depressed over the lack of success of his mission and was very bitter against His Majesty’s Government. He finally left in October and passed through Jedda again in June 1929, on his way to the Yemen, where he had been appointed Soviet commercial representative. He returned to Russia from the Yemen in January 1932. ( GIPD—6 5(C; tf&amp;PD—3 2—-14-3-d*—'.’O8 (13) Memorandum No. 15 (252/118/3), dated the 4th February 1936.

Enclosure to Serial No. (13), Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No, 40 (251/118/3), dated the 4th February 1936. With reference to the despatch No. 332, addressed to your predecessor on August 1st last by His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, relative to Iranian represen tation abroad, I have the honour to state that on January 7th the late Iranian Minister here, Mahommed Ali Khan Mogaddam, sent to my foreign colleagues here and myself letters expressing his regret that, having been appointed to the Iranian Legation for the Balkan States, he could not take leave of us in person. He informed us also of the prospective arrival of his successor “ Son Excellence, Rad” , 2. The late Minister’s letter terminates a very anomalous situation in Jedda, He left for Syria last May, without notifying the fact officially to his colleagues, having had, it would appear some arrangments with his Government which enabled him to regard the Lebanon as in some sense a suburb of this city to which he could retire without going on leave. It subsequently became known that the Iranian Legation here was to be combined with that in Cano and that Mohammed Ah Khan had been transferred to the Balkans but we remained for many months without official knowledge of these changes. 3. The Iranian Minister in Cairo, M. Soltan Ahmed Khan Rad, arrived in the roads of Jedda on February 2nd and landed here to-day to take up his additional post as Minister here. T understand that he will present his letters of credence towards the end of this month, when the King is expected to visit Jedda on his return from Nejd. 4.

I have the honour to report with regret the death of Sheikh Ahmed bin Awadth Ba Das, Sheikh of Iraq, which took place at Iraq on the 21st October 1935. 2. I have now received a declaration signed by certain relations and tribal Sheikhs, that Sheikh Ahmed bin Abdulla bin Ahmed bin Awadth Ba Das, grandson of the deceased Sheikh, has been elected as his successor as from 22nd October 1935. 3.

He left Riyadh again on February 19th and arrived in Mecca on the 22nd. He was accompanied by the Heir Apparent. He came to Jedda early on the 25th attended by the Amir Saud and some of the other junior princes. 3. His Majesty received most of the members of the diplomatic body in the forenoon of February 25th but departed from his usual custom of giving successive audiences to the various heads of missions on his arrival in Jedda. He had to receive the credentials of no less than three new Ministers later in the day and saved time by receiving the other representatives all together, plus one of the new Ministers, M. Maigret, who was already Charge d Affaires. In these circumstances the audience was even more formal than usual. The King appeared to be in good health and spirits. 4. I am reporting separately on the presentation of their credentials by the new Ministers of the U. S. S. R., Iran and France. By 5 p.m. they had been to see the King and were qualified to attend a reception of all the foreign representatives by the Heir Apparent in the afternoon. On this occasion the proceedings were equally formal but uniform was not worn except by M. Maigret, who had probably had no time to change. It is noteworthy, as a sign of the enhanced position of the Amir Saud, that he held this reception, not in the King’s Palace, but in another house frequently used for ceremonies. 5. On the morning of February 26th I visited the King to present Mr. Maxwell Darling, whose visit to Arabia in connexion with locust research has been the sub ject of other correspondence. His Majesty discoursed in the liveliest possible manner about locusts. He was greatly imbued with the traditional Islamic theory that these insects originate in the interior of a particular kind of fish, which apparently spews them forth on to an inland or islands, whence they fly over the sea to innocent countries like Arabia. I understand from Mr. Philby that this rests on some tradition of the Prophet, not binding (fortunately for Mr. Philby) as an article of faith, but generally accepted by true believers. The King could therefore not be expected to discard it, but he paid a passing tribute to the value of modern scientific research. 6. The King made no reference to any questions outstanding between Great Britain and Saudi Arabia. Fuad Bey had suggested that I might like to stay on after Mr. Darling’s audience to talk business. His Majesty, however, made no effort to detain me and I myself was glad to retire, as I had not received your final instructions on the major questions and had decided not to follow up at present my request for an audience to discuss the question of the Government of India dispensaries. Moreover the Soviet and Iranian Ministers were waiting to be received in private audience. 7. The King returned to Mecca on the afternoon of February 26th. There were no festivities during his stay. I had by way of precaution warned Fuad Bey that, while I could attend a formal audience to pay respects, I should be pre vented by Court mourning from attending anything in the nature of a social functions. 8. Great precautions have been taken in Mecca for some time past to limit the number of possible undesirables during the pilgrimage. Some of the measures taken have been harsh. They accord with the recent Saudi policy of discouraging destitutes from making the pilgrimage, discouraging also the use of unauthorised routes and diminishing vagrancy, but they are also attributed to the determination of the authorities to guard against any attempt on the King’s life, similar to that of last March. Reports have been set afloat regarding his own nervousness and the arrival of suspicious Yemenis in various places. These may be dismissed as un convincing but the overland pilgrimage from the Yemen is expected to be numerous and I am told that there is much apprehension among the inhabitants of Mecca, who are more gossipy than courageous. 9. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Government of India. ( 21 ) Memorandum No. 25 (391/118/7), dated the 28th February 1936. His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda presents his compliments to H. E. the Viceroy of India (Foreign and Political Department), and has the honour to transmit to11 him a copy of despatch to the Foreign Office, No. 1936, regarding Presentation of credentials ol new 60, dated the 28th February- Persian Minister in Jedda. Reference to 'previous correspondence : Jedda printed despatch No. 15 of 4th February 1936 [Enclosure to Serial No. (13)]. [Enclosure to Letter from Serial No. (21)]. His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 60, DALED THE 28TH FEBRUARY 1936. With reference to my despatch No. 40 of February 4th [Enclosure to Serial No (13)], I have the honour to state that Monsieur Soltan Ahmed khan Had presented his credentials as Iranian Minister at the Court to His Majesty king Abdul Aziz on February 25th. 2. I have met M. Rad more than once and have found him pleasant and I should say reasonably intelligent. His diplomatic experience outside Iran seems to have been small. He served in the Persian Embassy in Constantinople lor a couple ot years not long before the Great War but has spent most of his official life at home under various departments of the Iranian Government, including the Ministry ot Foreign Affairs, under which he served as “ Karguzar in the provinces, and the Ministry of Justice. He had been President of a section of the Court ol Cassation for six or seven years before he was appointed to Cairo about two years ago. He speaks French fairly well and appears to have a good knowledge of Arabic besides a knowledge of Turkish which I have not tested. 3. M. Rad has no intention of spending much of his time in this country. He told me on February 10th that he might not even leave a secretary here on his return to Egypt but simply close the Legation in Jedda, which serves no useful purpose except to a small extent round about pilgrimage time. 4. We have not yet met Madame Rad, who came here with her husband. I understand that she is only semi-veiled and is willing to appear in society. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India, Tehran and Cairo. ( 22 ) [Received on 29th March 1936, with the Political Secretary's letter No. 11, dated the 12th March 1936.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 4th March 1936. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 21, DATED THE 13TH JANUARY 1936. With reference to Mr. Calvert’s despatch No. 339 of the 26th November [Serial No. (10)]. I have the honour to state that, in view of the great development of the operations of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), during my absence from Jedda last year, I requested Mr. Calvert to prepare a general memorandum on the position reached by the end of 1935. Although this memorandum includes certain information which has already been reported to your Department, it adds a good deal that has come to the knowledge of the Legation since the date of the despatch under reference and gives a useful comprehensive picture of what has become the most important industrial enterprise in the west of Saudi Arabia. 1 therefore enclose a copy of it. 2. Most of the information collected by Mr. Calvert is fairly generally known here, but I would ask that section (c) should be regarded as confidential, especially as the map mentioned in the third sentence was shown privately to the member of my staff concerned by a subordinate employee of the syndicate, who thought afterwards that he had committed an indiscretion. The Legation has to reckon with the fact that Mr. Twitched, the general manager, is a somewhat secretive person, who might easily make it more difficult to obtain information, if he thought it were likely to be made public.3. Work on the road from Jedda to the Mahd is still in progress, and I under- ' stand that as far as approximately 72 miles from Jedda the road may be described, from the point of view of light motor transport, as good. The central portion of the total distance still presents difficulty, but the syndicate are now equipped with modern road-making machinery. Activity also continues at the Jedda ter minal ” of the road, where the construction ot the compound referred to in para graph 4 of the despatch under reference, on an area now stated to be 300 by 150 yards, is proceeding steadily. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the Department of Overseas Trade and to His Excellency the High Commissioner tor Transjordan. Enclosure. Memorandum respecting the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate [Limited) Mining Concession, dated the 11th January 1936. (a) Areas being worked, or about to be worked [or prospected in the near future). The operations of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate commenced in March 1935 at the Mahd-adk-Dhahab (position according to latest estimates at 23 degrees 30 minutes north by 41 degrees east) and near Yanbu The latter workings, where Mr. Shanks was engaged, were abandoned in the early summer, but the former have continued and have been developed with considerable prospects of success. Under the terms of the original concession reported to the Foreign Office by ^ Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 56 of the 24th February 1935 [Serial No. (31) in File No. 1-N./35)], by which areas which it is desired to prospect further should be designated within one year, and areas for exploitation must be fixed and subsidiary exploitation companies formed within two years of the date of the concession, it is becoming a matter of urgency to determine the areas which can be worked profit ably. Mr. Shanks has been away prospecting for the past two months or more (he returned on the 21st December, 1935), but had not had much success. His pros pecting trip is believed to have taken him in an easterly and north-easterly direc tion, well into Nejd, almost but not quite as far as the Jebel Hilit (see below). At the end of 1935 arrangements were stated to be under way for four separate prospecting parties to go out into the concessionary area, the districts to be ex plored being, it is said, Yanbu’ (in spite of previous failure in that neighbourhood). Wejh and two others not at present definitely known. M. Van de Poll left for Wejh about the end of December in this connexion. ^ (b) Facts known as regards handing over the Mahd to an Exploitation Company. The little we know on this subject may be summarised as follows. The first mention, I believe, was by a member of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate to a member of the Legation early in August, 1935. This was reported to the Foreign Office in our despatch No. 227 of the 6th August, 1935 [Serial No. (57) in File No. 1-N./35]. Towards the end of October, 1935, another member of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate stated that the syndicate had given “ the new company ” one square mile to survey, a conversation which was reported in our despatch No. 339 of the 2oth November, 1935 [Serial No. (10)], paragraph 5. It is difficult to determine from these brief references whether the Mahd itself is to be turned over to the subsidiary (it seems most probable) , or whether an adja cent area is being made over to it, or both. (c) Facts known or surmised regarding Difficulties with the Saudi Arab Govern ment. Difficulties are believed to have arisen with the Saudi Arab Government over the definition of the boundaries to the original concession. These boundaries are given at paragraph 2 of the enclosure to Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch to the Foreign Office No. 56 of the 24th February 1935, and were published in the Umm-al-Qura of the 12th February, 1935. In December 1935 a member of the Legation staff had access for a short time to a map in possession of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, on which a boundary line was traced.

With reference to Mr. Calvert’s despatch No. 325 of November 12th [Enclosure to Serial No. ('67) in File No. 1-N./35] and previous correspondence relative to the activities of Talast Pasha Harb and the Banque Misr group in connexion with this country, it may be worth while to report that the s.s. “ Kawsar of the Misr Naviga tion Company ran ashore on the Irk-Al-Ghorab reef about nineteen miles south west of Jedda earlv on February 28th. This ship was carrying the last important contingent of pilgrims from Egypt, including Princes Khadija, sister the e*- Khedive and widow of the late Abbas Helim Pasha. The master of the ship is an Italian, who has, I understand, been in charge of her on previous voyages to Jedda and I have heard no plausible suggestion as to what misled hmi out of the usual ■r.onrsp. 2. The “ Zanizam ”, the other pilgrim ship of the Misr Navigation Company, was in port at the time and went to the assistance of the “ Kawsar ”, whose pilgrims were duly landed in good time for the pilgrimage. The “ Kawsar herself, however, had been steaming at a rate of some thirteen knots and was very firmly stranded on the reef Efforts by the “ Zamzam ” to tow her eft had to be abondoned after three or four days and on the evening of March 9th a salvage contract was signed with the agents of Lambert Brothers, Limited, who had sent a salvage tug from i enm to stand by on the chance of its services being required. The “ Kawsar was refloated March 9th or 10th and came into port early on the 10th. 3. The “ Kawsar ” would appear to be a very solidly built vessel and has appa rently sustained comparatively little damage. Nevertheless the accident may delay somewhat the arrangements for the return of the numerous Egyptian Pilgrims now in this country. Princess Khadija had already arranged to proceed to Medma en route for Egypt by air and left Jedda on or about March 12th in an aeroplane, which had been sent from Cairo. 4. It is also worth recording that a start has been made this year with the use of aircraft for the pilgrimage. No general air service from Egypt was organised but, apart from the Princess Khadija’s aeroplane, three other small machines belong- in 0- to Misr Airwork arrived in Jedda from Cairo with a party of pilgrims. I understand that four had started and that the party included two cadets of the Egyptian Royal family but one of the machines, and I believe one of the young princes, got into difficulties at one or more places on the coastal route in the Northern Hejaz and failed to arrive in Jedda. 5 I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, the Government of India, Cairo and the Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Sloops.

With reference to Mr. Calvert’s despatch No. 341 [Enclosure to Serial No. (69) in File 1-N./35] relative to the financial situation in this country, I have the honour to state that the Saut-al-Hejaz newspaper of March 23rd, a date which coincided this year with the last day of the lunar year 1354, contained the first announcement of certain important fiscal measures. I am addressing you separately on those which related to the customs tariff and the currency system. 2. One other measure of considerable importance was sandwiched between two notices regarding customs arrangements nnder a general heading showing that all three had been sanctioned by royal decree. This empowered the Ministryof 'Finance to levy a yearly tax of 5 per cent, the rent on all properties in the Kingdom but not on a rental basis. Property occupied by the owner is exempted, subject to a provision that the tax must be paid on any portion of the property let to another occupant. Provision is made for the compilation of lists of rented pro perties and for the imposition of the tax as from the beginning of the lunar year 1355. J he tax is payable by the owner of the property. 3.1 am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department and to the Department of Overseas Trade.

[Enclosure to Serial No. (26)]. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 74 (586/244/4), dated the 29th March 1936. With reference to my despatch No. 355 of December 14th last [Serial No. (11)], I have the honour to state that the Saudi Arab Government have now rewarded the three principal ex-conspirators, who returned to this country last year under the “ amnesty ” proclaimed in January 1935, by giving them the following appoint ments :— (а) Seyyid Tahir Ad-Dabbagh to be Director of Education ; (б) Sheykh Abdur-Rauf Sabban to be a member of the Legislative Council, as reorganised for its new two years’ session beginning March 24th 1936; (c) Major Muhammad Sadiq to be Assistant Director of Awqaf. 2. These three gentlemen had already been treated with marked consideration, the first two were among the guests at the banquet presided over by the Amir Feyzal and attended by all the foreign representatives here on the evening of Jan uary 8th, the King’s Accession Day. Muhammad Sadiq was omitted from the banquet, possibly for some political reason, but he too seems to be favourably re garded in certain high Saudi circles. He did not come so much to the attention of His Majesty’s Government as various other conspirators, when the Saudi Govern ment were raging against them in and about 1932, but he has some importance in this country, as he commanded for a time the forces which defended Jedda for the Hashimites at the time of the Saudi invasion of the Hejaz. 3. I take the oportunity of correcting a misapprehension, under which I have laboured for some time regarding the Directorate of Education and which I may have conveyed to others. I was under the impression that the Saudi Minister in London was still theoretically Director General of Education and that the late working hand of the Department, another Egyptian named Ibrahim Shura, was Director. ° Fuad Bey tells me that Sheykh Hafiz Wahba vacated the department on his appointment to London but that it was not filled. Ibrahim Shura, the Director of the “ Sand Institute ” in Mecca, was made acting director. He has now reverted to his post at the Saudi Institute on the appointment of Ad-Dabbagh to the substantive post of Director of Education. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to Baghdad, Aden, Trans-Jordan and the Government of India. I have the honour to be with the highest respect.

E. the Viceroy of India (Foreign and Political Department), and has the honour to transmit to MS132FD „17 him a copy of despatch to the Foreign Office, No. 95-E., dated the 29th March 1936 and enclosure, regarding Currency and Coinage position in the liejaz. Enclosure 1 to Serial No. (27). Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 95- E.-(594/238/10), dated the 29th March 1936. You are aware that the currency situation in this country has undergone manw vicissitudes since TV&gt;n Saud concjuered the Hejaz. these have been particularly marked since early in 1931, owing to the brakedown in practical application of the regulations enclosed in Mr. Bird’s despatch No. 12 (196/196/1) of January 20th, 1928 and the further confusion entailed by the suspension of the gold standard in Great Britain in the autumn of that year. The English gold pound has remained throughout the main basis of the Saudi currency system but the market value of the Saudi silver riyal was in and after 1931 far below the official parity of ten riyals to the gold pound established by the regulations of 1928. 2. It may be well to recall very briefly the genesis of the system established by the regulations of 1928. The main elements in the pre-war Turkish currency were the Turkish gold pound, similar in fineness to, but about -9 per cent, of the weight, of the English sovereign ; and the famous silver coin called the Mejidie which, though it had depreciated somewhat, stood for many years in a fixed relation to gold The Turkish gold pound was divided theoretically into 100 gold piastres although the gold piastre did not exist as a coin. It ensued from this that the English gold pound was worth 110 gold piastres. The we/idie and its sub divisions, which included a current silver piastre, had various values according to the uses to which it was put but for official puiposes it was reckoned at about 102 piastres to the Turkish gold pound and about 112 piastres to the English gold pound. The market rate was lower. I quote these figures from memory but they are sufficiently accurate for my present purpose. 3. The Saudi regulations of 1928 substituted for the mejidie and its sub divisions Saudi silver riyals of exctly the same size, weight and silver content and established the legal parity, already mentioned, of ten riyals to the English gold pound, which had more or less superseded the Turkish gold pound. By an adapta tion of the old Turkish rates for gold, they provided that the English gold pound and the riyal respectively should be divided into 110 and 11 theoietical piastres called “ miri ”, which corresponded to the Turkish “ gold piastres ’ and into 220 and 22 current piastres, which came to be known as Saudi. 4. Frcm 1931 to 1934 the Saudi riyal fluctuated greatly, the general tendency being in the direction of depreciation, subject to seasonal variations in the opposite sense. Last year, however, the riyal, while still well below its legal value in terms of gold, showed a tendency to appreciate. There appeared to be a shortage of silver currency and early in the autumn the Saudi Government cast about for means of remedying the situation. They had already begun to import large quantities of Indian rupees, mainly for use in Nejd, where the Saudi riyal had never been popular and had never ousted the Maria Theresa dollar. They also contemplated a new issue of silver riyals, a project which has formed the subject of correspondence ending with my Chancery’s letter to the Eastern Department of February 1st last. I may add that after that letter was written, I had reason to suppose that the new riyals were to be similar, except for the Saudi superscription, to the Indian rupee ; that the quantity ordered, including presumably silver sub-divisions, was riyals 1,000,000 ; and that the parity of the new riyals would be fixed at Riyals 20 to the gold pound. One infoimant suggested to me that the existing riyals would be withdrawn and that the new issue would suffice for all requirements, a thing which I find it difficult to believe unless the rupees from India are used to eke out the official currency not only in Nejd but in the Hejaz. 5. Pending the issue of the new riyals, of which I have heard nothing further, the Saudi Ministry of Finance has sprung a fresh surprise on the public by publish ing on March 23rd a notice, which I enclose in translation. Its main effects appear to be to establish a new legal parity of the existing riyal at the rate of 20 to the gold pound for the purpose of transactions with the Government; to abolish the “ miri ” piastre ; to readjust the relation between Saudi piastres and the other elements in the currency by calculating the gold pound at 220 Saudi piastres, the riyal at 111 dated the 29th March m in the Hejaz. jreign Office, No. 95- h 1936. ;ry has undergone many' have been particularly 3tical application of the 96/1) of January 20th, of the gold standard in )ld pound has remained ut the market value of icial parity of ten riyals the system established e-war Turkish currency bout *9 per cent, of the coin called the Mejidie many years in a fixed oretically into 100 gold t ensued from this that be mejidie and its su fi cus values according to reckoned at about 102 res to the English gold from memory but they e mejidie and its sub- and silver content and aJs to the English gold pound.

Paragraph 4 provides that payments to the Government hitherto fixed in miri piastres shall be payable in S iudi piastres to double the number of miri piastres shown in the tariffs, etc. Thus the English gold pound remains the basis of currency as before but the existing riyal is officially de-valued to a rate approximating to that to which it had fallen, though with variations, in the market. 6. I prefer to postpone further comment on the new arrangements until I know more of their practical application. They produced some emotion in the markets of Jedda and Mecca for a day or two, but this seems to have died down, on its being discovered that market transactions in riyals are not necessarily effected though they may be influenced by the Government arrangements. The first effect in tfie local money markets was marked fall in the value of the riyal. The perma nent effect is difficult to estimate. It is possible that the who T e thing is a preclude to the issue of the new riyals but I confess my inability to see at present what the modus operandi is likely to be, if this should be the ca e. 7.

Instructions from the Ministry of Finance concerning rates of exchange, enacted with a view to stabilising the Saudi Arab currency. 1. The piastre known as the gold piastre shall be deemed to be out of use and shall be superseded by the Saudi piastre. 2. The Saudi riyal shall be deemed to be equal to eleven Saudi piastres, and the small nickel coins shall be calculated at the rate of two piastres to one Saudi piastre. 3. The English gold ponnd shall be accepted at the rate of P. 220 Saudi in selling and buying. 4. As certain revenues are based on the gold piastre, the amount specified therein shall be doubled when calculated in Saudi piastres. As to the revenues originally based on the Saudi piastre, they shall be re ceived on the same basis, namely, at the rate of P. 220 Saudi to one gold English- pound and P. 11 to one Saudi riyal, and P. 2 of the nickel coins to one piastre. 6. The Ministry of Finance, its branches and the revenue Departments shall accept such revenues in the different kinds of coins officially defined, namely, the English gold pound, the Saudi riyal and the nickel piastres at the rates now decided as they may be offered to them from the people concerned in payment of Govern ment revenues. 7. This decision shall come into force as from the beginning of Muharram 1355 (23rd March 1936). ( 28 ) (Received on 26th April 1936, with Political Secretary's letter No. 15. dated the 9ih April 1936.)

With reference to Mr. Oalvert’s despatch No. 275 of 7th October, I have the honour to state that M. Maigrot, the French Charge d’Affaires here, returned to Jedda on 18th January in the French sloop d’Iberville, which called onlv to land him and a member of his staff and left the same day. M. Maigret left again on 26th January, intending to proceed via Port Sudan and Hudeyda to San'a and to return about 10th February in the d'Iberville, which will call for him at Hudeyda. 2. It is now known that the status of the French Consulate here was raised to that of a Legation by a French law promulgated, I believe, last July and that M. Maigret has been given the rank of Minister Resident. These changes have notyet beefi officially announced to bis colleagues in Jedda but I understand that thef new Legation is to be inaugurated with some ceremony on M. Maigret s return and that the d Iberville which has on board Rear Rivet, Commanding Othcer of the b rench naval division in the Levant, will stay for the celebration. I believe that Ibn Saud intends to come to the Hejaz a few days ear.ier than he need do to attend the Pilgrimage and will visit Jedda to receive the credentials of no less than three Ministers, viz., M. Maigret, the recently arrived Minister of the U. S. S. R. (see my despatch No. 358 of 17th December 1935) and the Iranian Minister, whose arrival I am reporting in a separate despatch. 3. I have thought these developments worthy of being recorded in a spee'al report but I doubt whether any real political signilicance attaches either to M. Maigret s visit to San a or to the changes affecting the French representation in Jedda. As you are aware M. Maigret plays no important role here. He is a fairly well-informed observer of events but he has not visited France for some years and continues to give the impression of having little pull with the French Government. He has a much greater connexion with Syria and the French authorities there. He has vague leanings towards Islam and is, I think, on the best of terms with King Abdul Aziz and the Saudi Government but even with them he does not apper to carry much weight. I believe that the creation of a Legation and M. Maigret’s promotion are more than anything else the realisation of his own moderate ambitions and would have taken place sooner but for financial consideration in Paris.

As reference was made in the enclosure in my despatch under reference to his lack of moderation, I ought to say that it now manifests itself in abstention rather than excess, so far as alcohol is concerned.20 4.

Enclosure to Serial No. (31). 118 Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda oe the Foreign Office, No. (765/577/15), dated the 25th April 1936. You will remember that at the close of the Saudi Yeman war of 1934, Ibn Saud secured the surrender of Seyyid Hasan Al Idrisi and two other important members of the family Abdul-Wahhab and Abdul-Az:z, the latter of whom died last year. A rumour recently reached me that another member of the Idrisi family described by my imformant as “ Seyyid Al-Arab ”, had arrived in Jeddah last February and had been taken to Mecca, where the others are allowed to reside after the Italian Legation here had obtained guarantees for his being well-treated. 2. I was inclined, if there was anything in the story at all, to identify the person in question with Seyyid Mohamad-Al-Arabi, son of Abdul-al, son of the original Ahmed-Al-Idrisi, i.e., one of that branch of the family which is associated principally with the Sadan and Egypt. This man's submission to Ibn Saud would be of some little importance, as he was one of the Asiri delegation who came to Mecca in October 1930 in connexion with the arrangements for the absorption of Asir into the Ibn Saud’s dominions lut was afterwards concerned in the revolt of Seyyid Hasan in November-December 1932. It was understood that, after the collapse of the rebellion, he went with a nephew of his to Massawa which might account for the alleged Italian interest in him. 3. I took an apportunity to-day of asking Shaykh Yusuf Yasin whether Seyyid Al Arabi had arrived in Mecca. He replied that he had, he thought, been there for a year or so ; any how he had seen him there before he himself left for Riyadh last November. In view of this information, which I have no reason to doubt, it now seems to me probable that my previous informant’s sources were confusing two things, viz., the presence of Al Arabi in Mecca sometime ago and the more recent arrival from Jizan of certain other persons, whom I cannot indentify but who are said to have been landed in Jedda in conditions of some secrecy and conveyed to Mecca. Conflicting rumours have reached me regarding the composition of this party and the reasons for their being sent here. I am not, however, pursuing this matter, as my object has merely been to locate Al-Arabi for the reason given in the preceding paragraph. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to his Majesty’s High Commissioner for Egypt, Cairo, His Excellency the Governor General of the Sudan, Khartoum, His Majesty's Chief Commissioner at Aden and to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department at New Delhi.

His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit Cl em21 a copy of despatch to the Chief Commissioner, Aden, No. 552/79/3, dated the 25th March 1935, and enclosure regarding Exportation of tombac. Enclosure 1 to Serial No. (£2). Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Resident, Aden, No. 552/79/3, dated the 25th March 1936. I have the honour to enclose herewith a copy of a letter addressed to me by the Iranian Minister here regarding the abrogation of the monopoly of the exporta tion of Isfahan tomhncf formerly granted to a certain Khalil Matouk. My Iranian colleague requests that the information contained in the letter should be brought to your notice and to that of interested merchants in Aden. 2. The Iranian Minister handed me the letter in question himself, after sounding me some days earlier as to whether I could forward it. It would doubtless have been more regular for the Iranian Government to communicate with His Majesty s Government in the first instance, through more normal diplomatic channels, but as this procedure would in the circumstances be cumbrous, I undertook to forward his letter to you, subject to the express reservation that I was merely complying with the request of a colleague and that it would rest entirely with you to decide what course of action you should follow on receipt of the intimation contained in the letter. 3. I am sending copies of this desptch and enclosure to His Majesty’s Prin cipal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (32). Letter from the Iranian Minister at Jedda to His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, No. 85, dated the 24th March 1936.

(33) (Received on 3rd June 1936, with Political Secretary's letter No. 19, dated 7th May 1936.) Enclosure in Foreign Office Covering Letter No. E.-2101/2010/35, dated April 30th, 1936. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 90-E. (575/416/2), dated the 28th March 1936. With reference to my despatch No. 71 of March 11th [Enclosure to Serial No. (24)], I have the honour to submit to your notice a point of some little interest, which has been raised in connexion with the visit to Jedda of the salvage tu^ Preserver, which refloated the s. s. “ Kawsar”. 2. The Preserver entered the port of Jedda on her first arrival here and then proceeded to the Irk-al-Ghorab reef, where the “Kawsar” was aground. After effecting the salvage she entered the port a second time. On this second entry the local authorities did not ask for payment of the usual tonnage dues a second time but insisted that, under the regulations in force, the fixed dues of one pound gold for entry and two pounds gold for permission to employ a pilot must be paid aga n. Mr. Griffin, a member of the firm which represents the owners of the Preserver drew my attention to ^he difference in the practice followed in regard to the tonnagedues and of the fixed dues and asked my views as to whether the fixed dues could be claimed twice. He mentioned inter alia the fact that the same pilot remained on board the Preserver throughout the proceedings. 3. The most second recent Saudi regulations of which I have knowledge are those enclosed in translation in Mr. Calvert’s despatch No. 292-E. of September 24th, 1934. The tonnage dues, although described by Mr. Griffin as “ quarantine ” dues, would appar to be those prescribed under head 1 of the Appendix to the regulations. The fixed dues are clearly those under heads 6 and 7. It seems to me probable that the reason for not charging tonnage dues twice was that the dues are payable only on arrival from and departure for a foreign port; but that the authorities regard the fixed dues as being payable on any entry into the port from the high seas. 4. I told Mr. Griffin that in my opinion it would be difficult to contest the action of the local authorities in charging the fixed dues twice, especially as any attempt on my part to do so might be held to imply that I regarded the reef as being within Saudi territorial waters. I promised, however, as he attached importance to the principle, though not to the amount involved, to ascertain your views generally, and with special reference to the question whether immunity from the double payment could be claimed in virtue of any recognised practice in cases where a ship lying in a port has occasion to leave it temporarily for a point of the high sea's in the vicinity. 5. I at first thought of discussing the matter informally with the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs before reporting, it. On finding that the distinction made by the authorities could be plausibly explained as in paragraph 3 above, I decided that I might do more harm than good by approaching Faud Bey. I shall be grateful for an expression of your views on the whole subject. (34) {Received on 16lh May 1936, with Political Secretary's letter No. 18, dated the 30th April 1936.)

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 106 (688/385/15), dated the 14th April 1936. With reference to my despatch No. 57 of February 28th, I have the honour to state that M. Maigret, the French Minister here, is to proceed again to San a on April 16th in the French warship Bougainville, which arrived in Jedda on April 11th, in order to sign the Treaty of Friendship which has been the subject of negotiation for some time past between the French and the \emeni Govern ments. 2. M. Maigret told me to-day that he had practically completed the negotia tions during his last visit to San’a. At the last moment, however, the Yemeni Minister for Foreign Affairs dropped out of the negotiations for some reason (probably, I think, illness), and the King of the Yemen had appointed another adviser to take his place. This gentleman, wishing to show zeal, took exception to certain phrases, and the negotiations could not be completed. The French Government had now agreed to the amendments desired by the \ emeni Govern ment and there was no further obstacle to the conclusion of the Treaty. 3. M. Maigret described the Treaty as being a simple and rather anodyne instrument, but I gathered that it contains certain commercial provisions. The most important point outstanding when my French colleague last left the Yemen was apparently the wording of the most-favoured-nation clause. The YYmeni negotiator thought that the definition might be too general, if it provided for most-favoured-nation treatment “ in other matters” as well as in commercial matters. I understood from M. Maigret that the offending words had been either deleted or modified sufficiently to satisfy the Yemeni Government. 4 I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Chief Commissioner at Aden, HS132FD—25—-27.6»36—CUPS24 4 ? /'N 24 (36-A) {Received on 13th June 1936, w'th Political Secretary's letter No. 22 dated 28th May 1936.)

Bideford, has been instructed to forward this flag to the Naval Officer-in-Charge, Aden, for retention and issue to H. M. Ships visiting Shehr and Mukalla in normal circumstances, since it was made to the design of His Highness the Sultan. *###*** * His Highness the Sultan Salab Bin Galab Alkaity Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla, came abroad H. M. S. Bideford at 0915, on 14th April. 1936. He was accompanied by his son, Prince Sultan Amad Bin Sultan Galab, his Political Minister and Secretary in India, Khan Bahadur Sliaik Ali Baakza, J. P., his Personal Secretary, Nawab Ahmed Beg Khan (a relative of His Highness), his Aide de Camp, Mosin Bin Syead, an Arabic clerk and five servants. 2. A Guard was paraded when His Highness came abroad and the usual marks of respect were paid. At 0930 H. M. S. Bideford sailed for Mukalla. 3. Two cabins had been allotted to His Highness and his son, and the after end of the Quarter Deck screened off for the remainder of the party. His Highness and Personal Staff, however, had other ideas as to what they required, and annexed the after end of^the Boat Deck for use by day, and slept within the enclosure on the Quarter Deck by night. ******* * His Highness, his son and the three Personal Staff messed with me, the remainder feeding on the Quarter Deck. 5. The ship anchored off Mukalla at 1705 on 15th April 1936. A great number of native boats came out to welcome His Highness, while the shore was lined with thousands of people. A Guard was paraded when His Highness left the ship and a salute of eleven guns fired. A flag of suitable size has been made on board during the passage to His Highness’s design, and was flown when the boat went ashore. This flag consisted of a green Star and Crescent on a red background. It was noticed, however, that all the flags flown ashore at Mukalla were the usual plain red Mohammedan flag. When he arrived ashore HisHighness received an enthusiastic welcome. A saluting gun ashore fired a slow eleven-gun salute and a great crowd followed his car to the Palace. 6. Before leaving the ship, His Highness had asked if I would dine informally with him that evening and bring as many of my officers as possible. Pour officers and myself landed at 1930 and were met by two cars, in which we were driven to the Palace. The streets were lined with people and police were stationed every fifty yards, blowing whistles to clear the streets. Several police detachments turned out and presented arms as we passed. On arriving at the Palace I was surprised to find a Guard of about fifty file and a Band drawn up in charge of an Indian Army Instructor. Several regiments appeared to be represented. A salute was played and I then inspected the guard, who were extremely smart. In spite of the fact that the Palace had been unoccupied while His Highness was away, it was in good order and luxuriously furnished. After dinner, which was served in the European manner, and the usual formalities, my officers and I were driven back to the landing place, the police detachments again ti ming out and even the meanest inhabitant standing up and salaaming as we passed. 7. The Ship’s Company were landed in two parties next morning to See round the town, at 0630 and 0830. Cars were put at their disposal by His Highness. Three officers also landed and were shown round by His Highness’s Doctor. 8. H. M. S. Bideford sailed for Aden at Noon on 16th April 1936, and arrived at 1630 on 17th April. 1936. 9. I was informed that Mukalla has a population of about 30,000 and that His Highness maintains a standing army of 2,000 infantry and also a cavalry regiment. Mukalla has also a large and apparently efficient police force. The natives appear extremely loyal and contented. A Wireless Station has recently been built, but, though complete, is not yet in commission. The Palace alone is lit by Electric Light, but a large plant has been ordered from England and in the near future it is hoped to light the entire town by electricity. ##*#*##* (39) {Received on 21st June 1936, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 23, dated 4th June 1936.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 28th May 1936. Telegram froovi H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 68, dated the 231*0 May 1936. I made comlmuiiication orally to Yussuf Yasin on May 21st. My Italian colleague had previously notified the Saudi-Arabian Government in writing of the Italian Government’s decision. Yussuf Yasin had again seen him on the receipt of this communication and re-asserted the views of the Saudi-Arabian Government regarding the effects of their neutrality. As a result of this conversation it had been decided to return no further answer. Yussuf Yasin consulted me as to the correctness of his view that such silence would not commit his Government in any way. I expressed the opinion that if the Saudi-Arabian Government had made their contention clear in conversation after receiving Italian communication, no further reply was necessary. Attitude of the Saudi- Arabian Government seemed to me, I said, analogous to that of His Majesty’s Government subject to the difference that it was based on neutrality whereas that of His Majesty’s Government rested on other principles. 2. I do not of course know exactly what Yussuf Yasin said to my Italian colleague, but I am satisfied that the Saudi-Arabian Government have no intention of committing themselves prematurely to the recognition of Italian annexation. Enclosure to Serial No. (39). {Received on 21st June 1936, with Political Secretary’s letter, dated 4th June 1936.) Letter frgm the Foreign Office, to the Colonial Office, No. E.-2702|56]25, dated the 25th May 1936. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to invite a reference to Foreign Office letter No. E. 2702] 56] 25 of 21st May [Serial No. (36-A)], enclosing a copy of27 Je*Ida telegram No. 63 of 13th May and of Mr. Eden’s reply thereto on the subject of Italian relations with Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. 2. Mr. Eden has had under consideration, with reference to Sir Andrew Ryan’s telegram No. 63 (ibid), the possibly increasing danger of Italy embark ing on some new adventure in the Yemen. Although the balance of probability still seems to be against Italy attempting further acts of aggression in this area, the danger of her doing so clearly cannot be altogether excluded and it therefore seems desirable that every effort should be made to obtain a regular and rapid supply of such information as may be available which may have any bearing on the question. 3. I am accordingly to suggest, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the Resident at Aden might usefully be instructed to keep a special watch on the situation, and to report by telegraph at frequent intervals whether there are any signs of increasing Italian activity in South West Arabia. % 4. Possibly Sir B. Reilly may even consider it desirable that a special officer should be sent to the Yemen to observe and report on any developments in this direction. 5. Copies of this letter are being sent to the India Office, Admiralty, and Air Ministry. (40) (Received on 21st June 1936, with Political Secretary's letter No. 23, dated 4th June 1936.)

Yusuf Yasin informed me yesterday confidentially and again under instruct hons of the King, that Italian Government had recentlv offered to give Saudi Arabian Government six aeroplanes, three for training purposes and' three for civil use, The offer had been accepted in accordance general policv of preserving the appearance of friendly relations with Italy but the King’s fundamental policy of friendship with His Majesty’s Government remained unalterable. I said that your last expression of views regarding transactions with Italv was not fresh in my memory but that I thought general view of His Maiestv’s Government in this ease would he that while the matter was one for the iudgment of the Saudi Arabian Government, the Italian offer should be regarded with caution m view ot the possibility of political or other ulterior motives. a, a J' Suf , Va ; sir ‘ doola , r « 1 the , utmost caution had been used ; the Italian Charge &lt;1 Affaires had assured him that the sole motive was interest in the development o aviation in this country to which the Italian Government had collaborated bv training students sent to Italy last year.

I do not think it necessary' to devote a special despatch to the details of their quarrels but, in case they should later have any repercussion on the relations between this country and Afghanistan, I would draw your attention to the account given, as a matter of general interest, in paragraphs 192 to 194 of the Jedda Report for May. 2. M. Mojaddidi took up his permanent residence here on November 3rd last, after the closing of the Afghan Legation in Cairo, which was reported in Sir Miles Lampson’s despatch to you No. 1282 of November 8th. He had recruited two secretaries, an Afghan and an Egyptian, the first of whom went on leave a short time ago, while the second is leaving Jedda this week without any intention of returning. The Minister himself has spent much of his time in Mecca and Medina. 3. I take the opportunity of correcting a mistake in the Report on heads of missions enclosed in my despatch No. 20 of January 13th. Al-Mojaddidi has a wife and several young children in Jedda, about six, I think, besides several other children elsewhere. 4.

Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jf.iwa, to the Foreign Offioe, No. 112 (733!246( . 8), DATED THE 21ST APRIL. 1936. The enclosures in Mr. Hope Gill’s despatch to the Foreign Office No. 213 of Mav 18th 1932, [Serial No. (1) in F. No. 247-NJ32], relative to the constitution of this country included at E. a decree published on July 13th, 1928, pro\iding for the reorganisation of the Legislative Council. From announcements which have appeared in the local press since May 1932, this body would appear to have performed its functions with some industry during successive periods of two lunar vears. It is, however, more interesting as an organ, which, in a more ordered constitution than the country at present possesses, might develop into a Council of State than as a really effective or authoritative element m the present system of government. I have not therefore troubled your department with any special reports on its activities and I should not do so now but for two features in announcements made recently. 2 The last regular session of the Council, described as the fourth, ended on March 23rd the last day of the Moslem year 1354. It was reconstituted as from March 24th by a decree issued three days earlier and published on March 28th. I have adverted in another connexion to the inclusion in the new Council of Abdur-Rauf As-Sabban, formerly one of the most active conspirators abroad against Ibn Sand. The point to which T now have to draw attention is that the decree prescribed that the new session shall last for one year. This would appear on the face of it to involve a constitutional change from the system of two year sessions. 3. What is more important is that in a speech by the King on the opening of the new session, he said that he had ordered the preparation^during the new session of the Legislative Council, of a regulation providing for an annual meeting of representatives of every district of the Kingdom at pilgrimage time, in order to strength the bonds between the people and the Government. At a later meeting the Council adopted an address to His Majesty, which has been published with a good deal of other matter relating to the Council and its past and future activities. The most interesting document is the portion of the Amir Feysal’s speech, when the address was being considered, in which he dealt with the proposal for an annual national assembly. He explained that the renresentatives would meet for one month on the occasion of each annual pilgrimage. He justified the shortness of this period by referring to t 1 ’e inconvenience which would be entailed, if representatives from remote places were required to absent themselves far longer from their homes and to the inability of the Government to bear the strain of heavy expenditure. He added, however, that at the end of the month’s session, a permanent body would be set up (a sort of committee of the Assembly apparently) to consider the views etc., expressed by the Assembly. 4. It remains to be seen what, if anything, will come of this project. It recalls the abortive experiment described in correspondence ending with my despatch No. 279 of July 19th, 1931. On that occasion the “National Conference” was composed of representatives of the Hejaz towns only. It was intended to be annual but the urban representatives were somewhat fractious and the Conference was never re-assembled. 5. I may mention in this connexion another speech made by the King at a banquet in Mecca on April 14th. It consisted largely of religious exhortations, but it referred to his desire for greater direct contact with his people, so that he might know their desires and that they should know of his proceedings and intentions. With this object he declared his intention of receiving any one who liked to visit him between 8 and 9 p.m. in the evening and stated that in his absence I lie Viceroy would receive visitors in his place at Mecca or Taif, as the case might be. If this scheme should come into practical effect, it would be in some sense an extension to the Hejaz of the traditional system in Nejd, where the King receives tribal personages and the like very freely,(49) (Received on 4th Jidy 1936, with Political Secretary's letter No. 25, dated 18th June 1936.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated IGth June 1936. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jbdda, to the Foreign Office, No. 137, dated the 8th May 1936. With reference to my telegram No. 57 of April 30th [Serial No. (40)] and previous correspondence relative to the relations of Italy and Saudi Arabia, I have the honour to state that on May 7th Sheykh Yusuf Yasin informed me that Ibn Sand had consented to receive my Italian colleague at Ashaira, where His Majesty has been living in camp for the last two or three weeks. The King had tried to excuse himself but had agreed to the visit after M. Persico had repeated his request four times, stressing the infrequency of His Majesty’s visits to Jedda and, finally, the danger of an unfavourable impression in Rome, if his wish were not gratified. He had explained that his sole object was to pay his respects. Sheykh Yusuf thought that this was true but promised to inform me, if anything more important came of the visit. 2. I said that I did not think that the action of the King in agreeing to receive the Italian representative would be misunderstood. It is quite true that the King has been very little in Jedda during the last year and that M. Persico has had no opportunity of meeting him during that period as he was absent for both the King’s visits on February 25th-26th and from March 26th t 0 April 2nd. It is therefore, not unnatural that he should wish to make sure of seeing His Majesty before the latter proceeds to Nejd. It may be difficult for either to keep off such subjects as the training of Saudi aviators in Italy, the Italian offer of aircraft and perhaps the proceedings of the now discredited Signor Odello or to ignore completely the recent Italian successes in Abyssinia. It 'is indeed unlikely that my Italian colleague, who has probably acted on instructions from Rome, intends to undertake the somewhat laborious joinney to Ashaira merelv to say How do you do ? On the other hand I see no present reason to suspect a definite object on either side of major political importance. For one thing Sheykh Yusuf said that he himself would mfi go to Ashaira for the visit though a subordinate member of the staff of his Ministry would be in attendance. .3. I do not consider Sheykh Yusuf’s information important enough to telegraph, unless any further developments should appear to invest the matter with greater significance. 4.

M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 146, dated 17th May 1936. In my telegram Iso. 63 of the 13th May (S. No. 36-A), I had the honour to submit a summary of the account given me by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin of , e visit of my Italian colleague to Ibn Saud’s camp at Ashaira on the 10th May and of what passed between M. Persico and the King. I do not think it necessary to send you a full record of my conversation with Sheikh Yusuf, nut I may supplement my telegram by mentioning three points of some importance which I omitted from it, as follows :— (a) My Italian colleague, according to Sheikh Yusuf, began his statement to the King by thanking him for having observed neutrality in the Italo-Abyssinian war and for not having taken part in sanctions. The King replied that he had adopted his attitude for the sake of friendship with all con cerned. (b) M. Persico stressed the friendly dispositions of his Government towards the Arab nations and their readiness to give any required assurances in this respect. (£) At the end of the private conversation, in which the sheikh en gaged me after he had carried out his instructions to inform me of what had passed at Ashaira, he threw out a question regarding reports that His Majesty’s Government might with draw from the League of Nations and regarding the conse quences of such a step, if it were taken. 2. I did not comment on (a) or (b) above. As regards (c), I took the general line that I knew of no pronouncement by any responsible person which could lend support to the reports in question; that many people, it wjis trim thought that the League should be reorganised to make it more useful; but that, whatever happened (and no one could foresee what would happen), it would astonish me greatly, if Great Britain abandoned or des paired of the League. 1 adduced various considerations in support of my opinion, making it clear, of course, that I was only expressing my private views as between two friends, in accordance with Sheikh Yusuf’s request. 3. Mr. Philby, who was at Ashaira during M. Persico’s visit spent the evening at my house on the 13th May. His account of the audience, based on what he had heard from his friends, and possibly from the King himself was generally similar to that given me by Sheikh Yusuf, though not so complete and more loosely put together. He was even more outspoken than the sheikh about the perturbation caused in the King’s mind by the outcome of the Italo-Abyssinian war. The reason for the King’s reaction was, he said, his concern for British prestige. I could not get him to say definitely why the maintenance of that prestige should interest the King so greatly, but the implications of his language were clearly these: Reliance on Great Britain was the corner-stone of Ibn Saud’s policy. Great Britain had failed to oppose a successful resistance to Italy in the case of Abyssinia and had, in fact, let that country down. How, then, could the King have confidence in the will or ability of His Majesty’s Government to resist Italian ambitions in the Red Sea ? Like Sheikh Yusuf, Mr. Philby spoke particularly of the Yemen, saying that, when referring to the intended negotiations between Italy and the Yemen, my Italian colleague had spoken of a “strengthening” of the relations between the two countries. 4. Mr. Philby is as you are aware, not in the innermost secrets of Ibn Saud, and his language is very apt to be coloured by his personal sentiments. Nevertheless, I think that what he told me on tfhe 13th May faithfully represents Ibn Saud’s present outlook. The King watches, as best he can, events in Europe, but he has little true comprehension of them, much less of such concepts as that of collective security or any sort of security upheld S89(S) F&amp;PD35 by moral force. He has little real interest in Abyssinia, and has seen in the recent conflict not so much a war between Italy and an African o\ver as a struggle between Italy and Great Britain. He sees m e resu c sweeping victory for Italian force in this struggle. a , been for years, with the fear of Italian ambitions m the Red Sea, he fears that that' force may in the future be turned against the Av ^ 1 ^ ? en \ ra uf a As a Moslem ruler still engaged m consolidating his P 0 ® 1 ^ a f ^ and jealous of his hardly-won independence, he has no genuine love for Great Britain, a Power which block his way in variousdirections^ e_g m the east and south of the peninsula, but he has much less to fear ^om Bnt sh policy on this side of it than he thinks he has to fear from y* 5 The only fortunate feature of this is that Ibn Saud probably believes that it was not so much the ability as the will to save Ab yssmia that was wanting in the attitude of His Majesty’s Government as t , c0 ' c p e ' ve ^. h 1 ® simple mind. He probably still believes that a breach with them would be fatal to him, and hopes against hope that they would se ® thr S 1 f f d „ 1 r ' the event of a breach between him and any other ^ ur ®P«“^ 0W .^ eu ?;® 1 i t a v r ® not so against Great Britain. He dare not offend Italy. .Neutrality is more than ever his slogan, because, as I have said, he has seen not a war in Africa, hut a conflict, not yet ended, between Great B rltall I I witdi He does not vet know what its effects in Arabia may be, and reference to this struggle that he clings to the slogan.

Letter from the Colonial Office, to the Foreign Office, No. 78125/36, DATED THE 2ND JULY 1936. 1 am directed by Mr. Secretary Ormsby Gore to refer to your letter No. E. 2702/56/25 of the 25th May [Enclo. to S.

Secretary Eden, a copy of a despatch which has been ad ^essed to ti e Acting Resident at Aden on this subject, dated the 2nd July 193b. 2 As regards paragraph 3 of the despatch to the Acting Resident, I am to explain that it had already been contemplated, quite independently that Captain Seager, the Frontier Officer, should pay one of his periodical visits to Sanaa in the course of the next few months, and that Sir Bernard Reilly, before he left Aden, had informed the King of the Yemen of the projected visit. Captain Seager should have an excellent opportunity during his visit of observing any signs of increasing Italian activities in the Yemen. 3. Copies of this letter with the enclosure thereto are being sent to the India Office, Admiralty and Air Ministry. Enclo to S. No. (52). Letter from the Colonial Office, to the Resident at Aden, dated the 2nd July 1936. I have the honour to inform you that His Majesty’s Government have had under consideration the situation created by the Italian military succes ses in Abyssinia and the possibly increasing danger of Italy embarking on some new advanture in the Yemen. 2. Although the balance of probability still seems to be against Italy attempting further acts of aggression in this area, the danger of her doing so clearly cannot be altogether excluded, and it is therefore desirable to ensure the rapid supply of any available informatoin which may have abearing on this question. I shall therefore be obliged if a special and close watch may be kept on the situation in South West Arabia and if any signs of increasing Italian activities in that region may be communicated to me by telegram with as little delay as possible. 3. It has also been suggested that a special officer might be sent to the Yemen to observe and report on any developments of this nature. This suggestion has been discussed with Sir Bernard Reilly and it is understood that Captain Seager is to pay one of his periodical visits to Sanaa as soon as Mr. Ingrams and Captain Hamilton return from leave. You will no doubt consider it desirable that Captain Seager should make this visit before he takes the leave which is due to him and that he should take the opportunity to make a special study of Italian relations with the Yemen.

It will be observed that the effect of this communique is to amend the regulations issued in 1932 in respect of Article 10 only, by the addition of sub-section 2 which provides for penalties in case of con travention of the Article. 2. Whilst the provisions of sub-section 1 of Article 10 would appear to be unexceptionable, and I am given to understand that the practice of insistence on properly vised passports being presented before the issue of tickets has always been followed by certain shipping agents here, it would appear that the amounts of the fines provided for in the second sub-section are somewhat excessive.

In the course of a meeting yesterday Sheykh Yusuf Yasin mentioned that he had received a telegram from Ibn Saud some days before passing on a report by the Amir of Hasa, who in turn had received it from the Amir of Jubail, that about 3 p.m., on the 4th. July the sound of gun-fire (one shot I gathered) had been heard at Jubail though it was not very distinct. Two days later a similar sound was heard about half an hour before sunset, but this time it was very much nearer. Ibn Saud had instructed him, Sheykh Yusuf said, to enquire whether there was any special reason for the gunfire, as for example were smugglers being pursued. In answer to my query, he said that there was no sugges tion that Saudi territorial waters had been entered. He merely asked whe ther there as a reason for the firing and added that the Amir of Jubail was a new man in the post. I promised that I would make enquiries, and said that from my knowledge of sloops in the Red Sea it might possibly be so\ie form of gunnery or firing practice. I should be grateful if you could give me any information on this matter. I am sending copies of this letter to Rendel, Metcalfe and Hickinbo- tham.

It, however, it is specially desired that the King’s Exequatur should be issued in respect of the new district perhaps you will be good enough to furnish in due course a new Commission of appointment in which reference is piade to Aden and the Aden Protectorate in addition to those territories under the administration of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in which the Consul- General at present has jurisdiction. I would add that the territories of the Imam of the Yemen are not ter ritories under the administration of His Majesty’s Government. Enclo. 3 to S. No. (62). Memorandum No. P.

Letter from the Resident, Aden, to the Colonial Office, No. 352, dated the 22nd July 1936. I have the honour to refer to Colonial Office Secret despatch of July 2nd, 1936 [Enclo. to S. No. (52)], regarding the possibly increasing danger of Italy embarking on some new adventure in the Yemen and connected matter. 2.. I shall endeavour to have a closer watch kept on the situation in South-West Arabia and I shall communicate with you by. telegram should I see any signs of increasing Italian activities. I have instructed Captain Seager, the Frontier Officer, to make a special study of this subject when he next visits the Yemen and in this connection I should like to draw you atten tion to certain points which have occurred to me which are relevant to the subject under reference. 3. Our present information tends to show that any Italian activities in the Yemen, which may have underhand motives, are of a nature designed to avoid detection even to the closest observer as it is well-known that the pre sent ruling monarch would deal harshly and summarily with any foreigners or foreign organisations whose activities were aimed at undermining his authority to the detriment of his State and the future inviolability of his Kingdom. There is reason, therefore, to believe that Italian methods and practices in the Yemen, to which His Majesty’s Government might take ex ception in certain circumstances, are confined to subterranean and secret channels which amount in effect to a form of ‘peaceful’ penetration and in filtration brought about, as far as one can judge, by extensive bribery of the highest officials. There is, of course, an ostentatious'and superficial side to their activities and this Captain Seager will no doubt report upon in due course. He is now drafting a memorandum on Italian activities in the Yemen which is based on the somewhat meagre informatiQn at present in our possession. This I hope to be able to forward to you shortly, together with a military report on Yemeni war resources. 4. In my opinion the best way to discover secret Italian activities in the Yemen and these may well take such root as to present a startling fait accompli in a few years’ time or following the present King’s death—is to emplov more agents there. This is at present quite impossible on the pre sent monthly grant of Rs. 230 (about £17) at our disposal fof Secret Ser vice. These agents would work under the Political Clerk in Hodeida, Salih da’far, who has for many years, proved himself to be worthy of trust, ♦ T43 5. I therefore strongly recommend that the grant for Secret Service be increased to §1,000 (about £106) a month and that sanction for the increase may be given by telegraph so that the necessary arrangements for keeping the desired special and close watch may be made ,as soon as possible. 6. The amount of the increase required is necessarily only guess wore but I am of opinion that half-hearted measures should not be adopted and that it is better to have too much money at one’s disposal for such an impoit- ant purpose than too little. I should, of course, take care that all expendi ture was carefully considered and expended to the best advantage and it might be possible after a few months trial to fix on a sum somewhat less than that now asked for. 7. I enclose, for your perusal, a copy of a secret communication which I received from the Civil Administrator, Kamaran, a few days ago. Ihis is, no doubt, Italian propaganda, but it brings out a point which I have raised in this despatch and shows even how the man in the street is acquaint ed with Italian methods in the Yemen.

Seiyid Yahya Afsha a leader of Khoka arrived at Taif from Assab on 10th instant. He reported to the Amil of Taif that he had been summoned at Assab (on the day of the full moon) by the Governor of Assab. Others present were other Nakhodas, Yemeni merchants and labourers. The Governor made the following statement: — “Please inform your Amils (local Governors) that the Italian Gov ernment now exercise sovereignty (sic) over all Yemeni ports from Sheikh Said to Jeizan.” The Italian Governor apparently wanted the news to spread quickly as he asked his listeners to convey the information “abroad” as soon as pos sible. Informant who seems to be genuine adds : — “We all know that it is Italian propaganda and that the statement is only given to frighten the Yemeni Government and to annoy the British Government, but we know that the Italian Gov ernment is bribing all Yemeni officials from high Ministers down to Amils the same way as they did with the local Chiefs in Abyssinia.” Forwarded without comments.

I have the honour to report for your information, the death of ’Abdullah bin Husein, the Sultan of the Fadhli. tribe and the election of his son Salih bin ’Abdullah as his successor, by all his relations. This election is to the best of my knowledge and belief in order, and I have therefore accorded recognition to Sultan Salih bin ’Abdullah hiu Husein as the Sultan of the Fadhli tribe, and authorised the payment to him of the stipend previously enjoyed by his late father Sultan ’Abdullah bin Husein in accordance with the authority contained in Colonial Office despatch No. 22, dated 30th May, 1929. 889(S) F&amp;PD43 (65) Memorandum No. 84 (1486/236/19), dated the 14th August 1936.

With reference to Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 95-E., of March 29th last, I have the honour to report certain further developments in the currency situation in Saudi Arabia. 2. 500,000 new riyals arrived early in May and some appeared in cir culation almost immediately. The Government have, however, shown great caution in introducing the new currency and to this caution, accord- **vr ari Jeddah branch of the Dutch banking concern, the Nederlandache Handels Maatschappij, may be attributed the present comparative stability of the riyal, both in relation to the gold pound and to the Egyptian paper pound. It is also stated that the Government are resolved to maintain the present rate of 20 riyals to the gold pound, but whether this will be possible when the pilgrim season creates an added demand tor local currency may well be conjectured. 3.

At 0900 on 3rd June, accompanied by Mr. Burchell, Gunner, I landed, being received by the Captain of the Port; the General Officer Commanding, Hodeida,—now in plain clothes; a member of the Governor’s suite and Mr. Saleh Jaffar. A guard of Jionour with band were drawn up on the quay. After inspection of the Guard I proceeded to call on His Excellency Seiyid Abdullah A1 Wazir. My reception was most cordial, and through out our conversation, the keynote was friendliness towards Britain, and distrust of Italy, the view being freely expressed that it would be the Yemen next. The Wajzir was most eager to hear news of events in Abyssinia and wished particularly to know if it was true that the British Legation Guard had been withdrawn from Addis Ababa. Apparently there had been a persistent rumour in the Yemen to this enect. . He showed a great interest in and knowledge of the general poli tical situation in Europe, and was keen to know in what form the League of Nations—of which the Yemeni have no great opinion—could be made more eiiective. We parted on terms of cordial friendliness, with the Wazir expressing the desire to visit the ship on the following day should condi tions of weather and ma^l day permit. * * * * 8. Unfortunately the Wazir was unable to come himself owing to pres sure of work arising from the fact that it was mail day. A number of the members of his staff and other high officials were detailed to represent him. This party consisted of Kazir-Ali Al-Amri, Secretary to Governor and brother of the Prime Minister; Salim Bey, the General Officer Command- ing, Hoedida; Qahdi Abdullah A1 Hodaid, one of the assistants to the Governor; Muhsin Jalala, Port Officer, at one time barber to the King of the Yemen. * * * * The visit extended over one and a half hours and concluded with many compliments and expressions of friendship on both sides. Mr. Saleh Jaffar was most helpful to me throughout our stay and gave me every assistance, besides acting as interpreter during my official calls and receptipns. b j - (67) Letter from His Majesty’s, Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 225, dated 28th July 1936. I have the honour to refer to Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 21 of the 13th January last [S. No. (22)], in which he describe the develop ments up to that date in the operations of the Saudi Arabian Minina s yndicate (Limited), and to submit a further brief report on the subset quent progress of this concern, in order to supplement the brief references to the subject that have been made from time to time in Jedda reports. 2. The four prospecting parties referred to in the enclosure to the despatch under reference left Jedda early in January in various directions. Little was heard of their subsequent progress, except that at the end of that month reports reached the Jedda office of the syndicate that trouble had befallen certain members of the parties. This was probably not more serious than mechanical breakdgwns of their motor vehicles, but for a timealarmist rumours were rife locally, according to which difficulties had been encountered both at the hands of local tribesmen and ol local officials. These were either entirely false or grossly exaggerated. Indeed, Mr. T. P. Larken returned towards the end of June from fail after a period of several months of prospecting, during which time he travelled exten sively, mainly in an area south of Taif, and reported that he had met with no interference. He had equally met w r ith no success in his quest, and it was understood from him that the syndicate’s operations in the Taif area would now be definitely abandoned. 3. Much more promising results w 7 ere reported from the Wejh area, where the remains of old gold mines had been discovered at a number of places in and around Umm-al-Qarriyat, some 10 or 12 miles north of Wejh. It appears as though the syndicate propose to go rapidly ahead in this new area, for they have now about a dozen of their European and American staff stationed there. These include the personnel of their own aeroplane, a Bellanca monoplane, which arrived at the end of April and is based on Wejh, wdience it has several times made its appearance in Jedda. The pilot, an American, is accompanied by his wife, who acts as wireless operator, and by a mechanic. 4. Work continues at the Mahd-adh-Dhahab, or Cot of Gold. The road, of which mention is made in the despatch under reference, was completed in June and is reported to be a very serviceable affair for most season of the year over most of its length. A useful report on the major part of the road was drawn up by a member of the Legation shortly before the work was completed. Otherwise, the main interest in regard to the Mahd-adh-Dhahab centres round the problem of water. For some time drilling for water has been in progress and has been in the hands of American drillers, using American drilling machines. Progress has been slow and little or no w r ater has been found. More recently, the Jedda manager of the syndicate relates, the London office, becoming impatient at the apparent lack of success, despatched tw T o British drillers to this country, with British drilling machinery. The latter had just arrived when Mr. Dunckley spoke on the subject, but the two drillers had been here a week or two longer and had already considerably improved on the efforts of the Americans. W^ater, however, is still to seek, and the ^ matter is apparently a serious one, for, in the words of Mr. Dunckley: “No water, no mine.” The syndicate, he added, were prepared to drill to a depth of 2,000 feet, whereas at the moment they have not gone deeper than 100 feet., 5. I observe from Mr. Rendel’s letter of the 7th May last to Sir Andrew Ryan that a concern named the Mining Trust (Limited) now holds a controlling interest in the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), and assume that, since the flotation of the syndicate, the component interests concerned (as given in the enclosure to Foreign Office printed despatch No. 313 of the 14th August, 1934) have changed somewhat. In this connexion, I was recently struck by a statement made by the Jedda manager of the syndicate that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate was owned by the American Smelting Company, “lock, stock and barrel.” 6. In Jedda work on the terminal compound has progressed very considerably, but the various premises are not yet at a stage when they can be occupied by the staff. No signs of work on a jetty are apparent, but a landing ground for the syndicate’s aeroplane has been established in the immediate vicinity of the compound. Mr. K. S. Twitchell, the general manager in Saudi Arabia of the syndicate’s operations, left on the 24th June for the Priited Kingdom, and his place has been taken by another American, Mr. Park. 7. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade and to Transjordan.Letter from the Foreign Office, to His Majesty’s, Minister, Jedda, No. (E. -2559/271/25), dated the 7th May 1936. Lord Castle Stewart who is Chairman of the Mining Trust Limited and also a director of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate has asked us to let you know that Mr. G. F. Laycock, a director of the Mining Trust Limited is leaving this country on 15th May for Jedda. 2. Lord Castle Stewart tells us that Mr. Laycock, is a well-known mining engineer and Vice-President of the Terra Nova Properties Limited which operates the Buchans Mine in Newfoundland; and that the object of his visit to Saudi Arabia is to consult with the Managers of the mining properties in that country of the Mining Trust Limited which holds a controlling interest in the Saudi-Arabian Mining Syndicate. 3. I understand that Mr. Laycock will be arriving in Jedda towards the end of May and he would be grateful for any assistance that you could properly give him. (69) Letter from the Petroleum Department (Mines Department), Dean Stanley Street, Millbank, London, S. W. 1, to the Colonial Office, No. P. D. -236/16, dated the 18th July, 1936. Reverting to my letter of the 6th May and your reply of the 29th May, No. 78026/36, about the attitude to be adopted to the proposal of Petroleum Concessions Limited to apply for an oil concession in the Yemen, I think you will be interested to see the attached copy of an official letter from the Admiralty to the Foreign Office, which probably you have not seen, regard ing a similar attempt which has been made by the Company to obtain an oil concession from the Saudi Arabian Government over the Western coastal areas in the Red Sea. You will see that the Admiralty attach importance to preventing Italian interests from entering into competition for this concession. I should explain that at a comparatively late stage in the negotiations the Italian Minister at Jedda intervened to request the Saudi Arabian Govern ment to defer the grant of a concession until Italian interests had had time to come forward. In this connection the Saudi Minister of Finance enquired about the standing of Petroleum Concessions Limited, vis-a-vis H. M. Government, and was informed by H. M. Representative that H. M. Government fully support the Company. We have just heard that the Company have secured the concession. I think the above has a rather important bearing on the question of the line to be adopted in regard to the Company’s project in the Yemen. When the Italians find they have failed in Saudi Arabia it is possible they may try elsewhere in this neighbourhood and I would be glad if you could consider again the possibility of doing something in the Yemen to support the only substantial British interest which is available. In view of the terms of your letter of the 13th May to Reilly he will hardly feel that he ought to go out of his way to help. What I suggest is that Reilly might now be told that we are anxious to see Petroleum Concessions Limited get the concession they are seeking and' ask him to consider whether anything can be done to assist. I am sending copy of this letter to Rendel. 889(S) F&amp;PDLetter from the Admiralty to the Foreign Office, No. M.-03230/36, dated the 2nd July, 1936. With reference to your printed letter No. E.-3797/1283/25 of the 25th June, and subsequent telegraphic correspondence from H. M. Representa tive at Jedda, concerning the Saudi Arabian Red Sea Oil Concession, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that they attach importance to preventing Italian interests from entering into competition for this concession. Copies of this letter have been sent to the India Office, Petroleum Department and Department of Overseas Trade. Letter from the Colonial Office, to the Foreign Office, No. 78026/ 36, dated the 22nd August 1936. I understand that you received a copy of Starling’s letter to me of the 18th July on the subject of the application of Petroleum Concessions Limited for an oil concession in the Yemen. There are obvious difficulties in affording any active support to the company; and before I discuss the matter with Reilly I should be glad to know what line you woulcTlike us to take. Letter from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, No. (E.-4590/ 260/91), dated the 28th August 1936. Will you please refer to Starling’s letter No. 236/16 of 18th July, to you and connected correspondence about the attitude to be adopted to the proposal of Petroleum Concessions Limited to apply for an oil concession in the Yemen. 2. We have been recently reconsidering the attitude to be adopted towards Petroleum Concessions Limited in their quest for oil concessions in the Red Sea area in the light of growing evidence of Italian designs and aims in that region. As a result we are wondering whether as regards the Yemen our attitude towards Petroleum Concessions Limited may not perhaps have been hitherto a little too rigid, particularly as when they were seeking a concession in Saudi Arabia we went so far as to assure the Saudi Arabian Government that His Majesty’s Government fully supported them. We cannot of course identify ourselves with any parti cular company to the prejudice of other British or quasi-British concerns or press the Imam to grant a concession to any particular company. Nor can we well take part in the actual negotiations for the concession. Further more, the absence of direct diplomatic representation in the Yemen makes it difficult to extend to the Company the ordinary facilities which we should extend, in a normal country, to a British Company which had our confidence. At the same time there may well be ways and means by which the Resident at Aden could indirectly facilitate the company’s task; and it is clearly in the interests of His Majesty’s Government that Petroleum Concessions Limited which, although an international concern, is nominally a British Company with an important British element, should obtain any concession which the Government of the Yemen may be willing to grant, rather than that such a concession should go to the Italians. Moreover we are inclined to doubt whether the appointment of Major Holmes as the Company’s mouthpiece in the Yemen should be allowed to affect the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the Company’s activities for it must be remembered that he is being given every facility by the Persian Gulf Authorities in his search for concessions in Bahrain and on the Trucial Coast.3. In these circumstances we fully concur in the terms of Starling’s letter referred to above and hope that the Colonial Office may find it possible to inform Sir B. Reilly that His Majesty’s Government would like to see Petroleum Concessions Limited get the concession in preference to any Italian concern and that within the limitations described above he should therefore facilitate the company’s task in any way he properly can. It could of course be pointed out to Sir B. Reilly that it would not be proper for him to take any direct part in the negotiations or to urge the grant of a concession to the Company. 4. Since this letter was drafted I have received your letter No. 78026/ 36 of 22nd August to Rendel (who is on leave) asking for our views on this subject, which I think are clearly set forth above. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to Starling. Letter from Petroleum Concessions Limited, City-Gate House/ Pinabury Square, London, E. C.-2, to the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, Whitehall, S. W.-l, No. P. C.-41/92, DATED THE 3RD SEPTEMBER 1936. In continuation of our letter of March 23rd, 1936, upon which your letter No. 78026/36, dated April 23rd, furnished certain comments, we have now to report that, as suggested in our letter, Major Holmes has addressed His Majesty the Imam, offering his services in the direction of exploring the oil resources of the Yemen, and asking for an audience. He received a reply from the Imam about a month ago, a translation of which is passed to you herewith. Major Holmes has, owing to preoccupations in the Persian Gulf, not been able to visit Aden as he had hoped. His letter to the Imam was, however, communicated through the Chief Commissioner. The Company has not, at the moment, developed any further plans for approaching the Government of the Yemen, but should it do so we will communicate them to you in due course. Translation cf a letter from the Imam of the Yemen to Major Holmes, dated the 2nd Day of Rabi al Thani, 1355. In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful; to his Honour, the respected Major Holmes. We have been glad to receive your letter dated the 29th May, 1936, which was submitted to us through the respected Government of Aden, and we thank you for your sincerity and love shown towards the Arab people, and, in particular, we are greatly pleased by the success of your under taking in a country which is a brother of our Kingdom, according to what we have learnt from the details given in your letter; and be sure that I share in the gratitude of my brothers, the principality and people of Bahrain, for your services there. As regards your wish to visit our Kingdom and initiate scientific enquiries there also, we hasten to tell you that this desire increases our gratitude towards you; but, as no doubt you became aware on your former visit, the particular internal conditions of our country are not favourable to investigations in a general way, though they would secure the pursuance of your scientific enquiries in certain suitable areas. We take this opportunity of expressing our appreciation of your efforts. t With all respects, (Imam’s Seal)-Letter from the Colonial Office to the General Secretary, Petro leum Concessions, Limited, No. 78026/36, dated 25th September 1936. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Ormsby Gore to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. P. C.-41/92, of the 3rd September from which he notes that, as a result of the reply received from the King of the Yemen, it is not proposed for the present to address the King further on the subject of an oil concession. (70) Letter from the British Legation, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 252, dated the 24th August 1936. With reference to Sir Andrew Ryan’s, despatch No. 57 of the 28th February last, in which he reported the presentation by Monsieur Maigret of his letters of credence as Minister Resident to King Abdul Aziz, I have the honour to inform you that on the 14th August my French colleague presented fresh letters of credence to the Amir Feysal, in his capacity as Viceroy of the Hejaz, this time as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. 2. The event was briefly recorded in the “Umm-al-Qura” of the 21st August, but no details as to whether Monsieur Maigret delivered a speech, were given. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s High Com missioner for Egypt, Cairo, and to His Majesty’s Chief Commissioner, Aden.

Letter from the British Legation, Gulhek, to the Foreign Office, No. 410 (604/4/36), dated the 27th August 1936. With reference to Mr. Bateman’s despatch No. 417, of the 14th August, I have the honour to inform you that the visit of Seyed Muhammed Zubara, Minister of Court of the Yemen, has been gLen considerable prominence in the Persian press. 2. In an interview published in the “Journal de T&amp;ieran” of the 21st August, Seved Muhammed Zubara, after suitably flattering refeience to the progress of Iran and to the personality of the Shah ai ^ Valiahad, by both of whom he has received, went on to refer to the hi st o ri - eal friendship between Iran and the Yemen He said that he hoped that this friendship would shortly be further strengthened by the visits of Yemeni Princes, possibly of sons of the Imam, and that he thought it likely that Yemen student would soon be sent to study at the University of Tehran. He added that this extension of relations^ between the Yemen and Iran necessitated the creation of a Yemeni Diplomatic Mission m Tehran and the appointment of an Iranian representative to Sanaa. 3 Whether Seyed Muhammed Zubara’s statements are of any import- ance remains to be seen. In any case, Monsieur Motamedy, now Head of the Near Eastern Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recently informed a member of my staff that the present visit was of no political importance, and this is borne out by the fact that, though a dinner was given to the distinguished visitor by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Monsieur Motamedy, who was on holiday within easy reach of Tehian, did not bother to return to the capital to attend it Monsieur Motamedv thought that Seved Muhammed Zubara’s visit was larsrelv to be explained by the fact that he was a Shiah, and he has in fact now left Tehran to make a pilgrimage to Meshed. i50 4. According to the “Journal de Teheran”, Seyed Muhammad Zubara will return to his country by way of Iraq, Syria and Egypt. 5.

I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit herewith, for the information of the Marquess of Zetland, copies of despatches from the Kesident at Aden and the Amir of Dhala to the Political Secretary, Aden, which have been received from the Colonial Office together with a certi ficate of nationality and identity which is sent for disposal. Letter from the Resident, Aden, to the Colonial Office, No. 408, dated the 19th August 1936. I have the honour to refer to your despatch No. 178, dated 20th June, 1936, regarding the national status of Salih Hasan, and to transmit, for your information, an extract of a letter dated 4th March, 1936, from the Saqladi Sheikh of Sahib, a Chief in the Aden Protectorate, together with copies of this Residency letter No. 5553, dated 28th July, 1936, to the Amir of Dhala, a Chief in the Aden Protectorate, and of his reply dated 1st August, 1936, on the subject. 2. It now transpires that Salih Hasan is not a British protected person and he should not be regarded as such. 3. The enclosures are returned herewith. Extract of a letter dated 4th March, 1936, from the Saqladi Sheikh j of Sahib to the Political Secretary, Aden. In reply to your letter No. 576, dated 25th January, wherein you informed us that the Colonial Office at London informed you that an Arab whose name and description (shewn therein) has submitted an application for a certificate of nationality and identity, the name is Saleh Hasan, we inform you, oh friend, that we have enquired about the said person but could not find any trace about him at Shaib. The place and date of birth is Qariat A1 Husein. May we point out to you that A1 Husein is known to you as one of the towns of the Amir hence we cannot interfere in this matter and it is for the Amir to institute enquiries for his sons and country. The photograph is sent herewith. Greetings. r Letter from the Political Secretary, Aden Residency, to the Amir of Dhala, No. 5553, dated the 28th July, 1936. Oh friend, we refer you to your letter dated 16th December 1935, in which you informed us that Salih Hasan was not one of your subjects but that he belonged to the outskirts of ‘Mureis’, which is in the Yemen. 2. From a further communication received from the Colonial Office, London, we noticed that the applicant—Salih Hasan was in possession of a certificate of nationality and identity issued to him by the India Office, London, on the 9th May, 1928, on our recommendation in which his place and date of birth is given as “Qariat El Husein”, Dhala, December 1895. In this connection we invite attention to your letter dated 23rd January,1928, a copy of which is enclosed, in which you informed us that the appli cant Vv%s one of your subjects who lived in El Husein village in Dhala and requested us to grant him a passport. 3. In the circumstances we shall be obliged if you will be good enough to cause further enquiries to be made and let us know whether Salih Hasan is the same-man referred to in your letter dated 23rd January, 1928, and is one of your subjects. We enclose his old certificate and a new photograph for purposes of identification, and request that they may be returned with your reply as early as possible. Greetings. Letter from the Amir of Dhala, to the Political Secretary, dated 1st August 1936. We have received your letter No. 5553, dated 28th July, 1936, regard ing Salih Hasan who alleges to be one of our subjects, and in reply we inform you, oh friend, that he has sent us a letter in the year of 1346 {1927) from the sea and therein he mentioned that he is one of our subjects and so we believed his statement and made no enquiries. When your last letter was received we made enquiries and we could not find any trace of his people, section or sub-section. He does not belong to Qariat A1 Husein and there is no truth in his statement. We cannot write you lies. In his previous letter he gave us false information but it has now been ascertained after enquiry that he is not one of our subjects. Greetings.. (75) Poreign Office, Memo. No. (E.-6028/1283/25), dated the 23rd Septem ber 1936. Saudi-Arabian Red Sea Oil concession. Major Longrigg, of Petroleum Concessions Limited (the I. P. C.) called on me yesterday morning for a general talk about his recent negotia tions with the Saudi Government. Beyond giving me a good deal of the local background— e.g., the friendly reception he had received at Taif, the agreeableness of the climate of Taif, the general manner in which the negotiations were conducted, some sidelights on the personalities con cerned, and rather a gruesome account of M. Biraud’s last illness—Major Longrigg did not tell me much that we did not already know. 2. He produced the attached sketch map of the concession, but agreed that it did not go much further than the text, since in the north and south the concession is bounded by the northern* and southern frontiers of Saudi Arabia, while inland it is bounded generally by a line running 100 miles from the coast; but the precise method of interpreting that definition or drawing the line has been left over for subsequent discussion if and when oil is found in the neighbourhood of the boundary. The sketch map throws no light on this point. 3. Major Longrigg, said that the Company intended to do its best to develop the concession, since the payments to the Saudi Government w T ere steeply graded, and it would not pay the Company merely to put the concession into cold storage. He agreed that oil experts were often un reliable and mistaken, but he thought that there was a distinct probability of oil being found, particularly in the southern area. The Saudis had apparently been anxious that the Company should take on the Wadi Sirhan as well, but the Company had come to the conclusion that the prospects of oil were too remote in that area to justify them in extending the concession to include it. * Up to Mudawara.4. Major Longrigg impressed me more favourably than I had expected. It seems also that he speaks Arabic fluently and carried on his negotiations exclusively in that language. He said however that he thought that his Company had been enormously helped in their negotia tions by the efforts and intrigues of the Italians, of which Ibn Saud was profoundly suspicious, so that, as the Italian intrigues increased, he had become the more ready to let the concession go to a British concern. 5. Major Longrigg then turned to the question of the Yemen, on which 1 am dictating a separate note. (76) Telegram from His Majesty’s. Minister, Jedda, No. 114, dated the 8th October 1936.

Your letter of the 7th September (E.-5523/2617/91), on the subject of Italian designs on the Yemen. You have no doubt by now seen our despatch No. 950 (203/1/36) of ^ the 29th August [S. No. (81)] on this subject. There is really not a great deal which we can add to the information contained in that despatch. At various times since the conclusion of the Italo-Yemenite Treaty in 1926, there have been rumours that Italy was casting an acquisitive eye on the Yemen, but at the same time and up till last year, the Italian authorities showed a desire to allay these suspicions as far as possible. We ought not, however, to forget the speech which Signor Mussolini made to the Quinquennial Fascist Assembly in 1934. In this speech, to which we drew your special attention in our despatch No. 950, and which formed the subject of the Embassy’s despatch No. 245 (189/2/34) of the 19th March, 1934, he said that “Italy’s historical objectives have two names: Asia and Africa. South and east are the cardinal points which should stimulate the interest and determination of Italians. Northwards there is little or nothing to be done; nor is there more to be done westwards, neither in Europe nor beyond the ocean. These objectives of ours have ^ their justification in geography and in history. Of all the great western Powers of Europe the nearest to Africa and to Asia is Italy. A few hours by sea, fewer still by air, suffice to join Italy to Africa and Asia. Let no one misunderstand the scope of this secular task which I assign to this and future Italian generations. It is not a matter of territorial con quests, and let this be understood by all near and far alike, but of a natural expansion which should lead to collaboration between Italy and the peoples of Africa, between Italy and the nations of the Near and Middle East.” As an assurance of peaceful intentions Signor Mussolini’s declaration has of course proved valueless in the event, but it is perhaps of some interest as an open indication, if one were needed, of Italian aspirations in the Near and Middle East. There can be no real doubt that Italy desires to increase her influence in that part of the world and there is every reason to suppose that she would be glad enough to establish a footing on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea if a favourable opportunity offered. All this, however, does not mean that Signor Mussolini has already prepared plans for an early advance against the Yemen. On the contrary we believe that while there are no doubt not a few Italians—and some of them perhaps in high places—who are casting covetous glances at the Arabian shores of the Red Sea, no serious authority contemplates any 8?V(S) F&amp;PDforward action in that area for the moment. Italy has trouble enough on her hands, particularly in the economic and financial spheres, and of course Abyssinia has still to be digested; indeed, the greater part of that country has not yet even been swallowed. Italy’s foreign policy is essentially opportunist and I therefore hesi tate to venture any prophecy as to future trends. My own personal view is that Italy will quietly but determinedly make a drive during the next few years at undermining our influence in the Arab and Moslem world; so we must be prepared for intrigue of every sort. But I doubt whether they will “strike” just yet. They are more likely to concentrate on prepar ing the ground, perhaps in the hope that they may eventually be able to get what they want without having to “strike” at all. ( 81 ) Letter from the British Embassy, Rome, to the Foreign Office, No. 950, dated the 29th August 1936. I have the honour to inform you that, according to a recent Stefani communique, the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between Italy and the Yemen dated the 2nd September, 1926, the text of which was enclosed in Mr. (now Sir Charles) Wingfield’s despatch from this Embassy, No. 846 of the 4th October, 1926, has been extended until November 1937 by an exchange of notes between the two Governments. I shall not fail to supply you with the text of these notes as soon as they are published in the Official .Gazette. 2. The extension of this treaty has been the occasion of considerable comment in the press here. An article in the Popolo di Roma recalls that the important points established by the treaty were the declaration by the Government of the Yemen of their willingness to import technical material from Italy and to admit Italian experts into the country to assist in its economic 'development, and the declaration by the Italian Government of their willingness to grant facilities in this sense. When the treaty was concluded (continues the writer of the article) a number of Arab journals expressed the fear that Italy was planning to turn the Yemen into a zone of exclusive Italian influence and that the provisions of the treaty were not compatible with the full independence of that country. The ten years which have lapsed since the treaty was signed have been sufficient to explode this myth. Not only does the agreement not impinge in any way on the liberty of action of the Yemen Government, who are not obliged by it to accept Italian materials or experts against their wishes and whose liberty to purchase in whatever market they wish is expressly reserved, but Italy’s policy since the signature has given rise to no suspicions that she has any other designs in the country than those compatible with true friend ship. 3. In an article in the Messaggero it is stated that the prolongation of the treaty corresponds with the plans of the Italian Government for the development and maintenance of peaceful relations with the countries on the eastern coast of the Red Sea, where there exists a long tradition of commercial exchange and affinity of custom and religion with Ethiopia. Italy is determined, says the writer of this article, through relations of “bon-voisinage” maintained with these States, to contribute by all the means in her power to their progress and civilisation. She has no designs on their independence or their autonomy. This policy “is an aspect of the Italian Empire which will assume more and more importance as time goes on and which fits in perfectly with the programme of relations between Italy and the Orient on which the Duce insisted in two memorable speeches.” The speeches to which reference is here made appear to be those which he pronounced at the opening of the Congress of Asiatic Students in December 1933, a summary of which was enclosed in Sir EricItaly has trouble enough on nancial spheres, and of &gt;d, the greater part of that unist and I therefore hesi- ds.

I venture to draw your particular attention to the portions of this speech in which Signor Mussolini touches on the role that Italy was designed by history and geography to play in Asia and Africa. Kecent events give his words a peculiar significance. 4. Thus it will be seen that the renewal of the treaty between Italy and the Yemen has been made the occasion for a number of inspired articles illustrating the role of patron and friend which Italy aspires to play and which she believes she has already begun to play in the Near East. Colla boration with the Arab races, as the Giornale d’ltalia observes, is to be developed to the mutual advantage of both parties. The conquest of Ethiopia, it is said, has been a great step in this direction, for opposite the Arab littoral now lies, not the amorphous dynasty of Abyssinia, but the Italian Empire with its harbours and roadsteads open to the exchange both of goods and of ideas. Nevertheless Italy does not, it is maintained, cherish designs on the liberty of the Arab States. On the contrary, their independence and their friendship are cardinal points in her policy. 5. These comments are doubtless designed to impress foreign (and in particular Arabian) as much as Italian opinion with the value of friend ship with the newly-founded Italian Empire and with the innocuousness of Itaian policy so far as the eastern shores of the Red Sea are concerned. Time alone can show the extent to which these professions will be trans lated into practice. 6. I have sent a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s representative at Jedda. ( 82 ) Copy. (E.-5052/4552/25). Enclosure in Foreign Office. Covering letter dated 16th October 1936. Lord Castle Stewart called upon me by appointment on August 5th bringing with him Mr. K. S. Twitchell the American who is managing the affairs of the Saudi-Arabian Mining Syndicate Limited. I had under stood that Mr. Twitchell had certain definite information which he wanted an opportunity of giving us but when the interview started it appeared that he was simply prepared to answer any question which I liked to ask him about general conditions in Saudi-Arabia. We had a certain amount of desultory conversation about the progress which the Mining Syndicate was making but, beyond the fact that the Syndicate found all the Saudi- Arabian authorities well disposed, with the possible exception of Yusuf Yasin, and that, apart from a regrettable tendency on the part of the local population to put boulders in the paths of motor cars, they had no particular difficulties, nothing much emerged. The Syndicate are apparently well satisfied with their progress and hope the mining will prove valuable. It soon became apparent that what Lord Castle Stewart and Mr. Twitchell really wanted to talk about was Italian influence in Saudi-Arabia. They were both rather disturbed by the efforts which the Italian Minister was making to impress the Saudi Government and by the possible consequences of the recent gift of aeroplanes, from the Italian Government to the Saudi .Government. Mr. Twitchell volunteered the opinion that the Saudis were deeply suspicious of the Italians and were not likely to facilitate the task of Italian penetration but he evidently thought that in practice it might be difficult to resist such penetration. In his view the United States and Great Britain were the only countries whom the Saudis were likely to trust. The United States though quite intersted57 in the operation of American companies in Saudi-Arabia were not likely to take any active steps and he for his part would like to see His Majesty’s Government increasing their own influence in Saudi-Arabia. Both 'he and Lord Castle Stewart agreed that it probably would not do to give any appearance of running after the Saudis and they disclaimed any suggestion that His Majesty’s Government should enter into competition with the Italians and the French in presenting aeroplanes to the Saudis. What they were really afraid of I think was that the Italians might at some future stage try to get hold of the landing grounds which the Saudi- Arabian Alining Syndicate is making for its own use within its concession area. They suggested that it would be well w T orth while for His Majesty’s Government to consider whether the Saudis could not be attracted to this country more by an offer of facilities for training air pilots in the United Kingdom. I said that I thought there might be difficulties about this as His Majesty’s Government’s own hands were pretty full at present with air force expansion. However, I said that we would certainly consider whether anything on the lines suggested was feasible. Lord Castle Stewart said that the company had met with a certain amount of difficulty from the health point of view. A number of their employees had suffered from undefined illnesses and one or two had died. The company were therefore taking steps to engage the services of an expert from the London School of Tropical Medicine to make a special study which would last for some months. They would propose to present the results of this study to the Saudi Government and it occurred to Lord Castle Stewart that one way of extending our influence would be in the field of medicine in Saudi Arabia. He seemed to have some idea of estab lishing a permanent medical adviser to the company who would also give the benefit of his advice to the Saudi authorities. I said that the idea of communicating to the Saudi Government the results of any expert investi gation which the company might undertake seemed to me a useful one. As to the establishment of any permanent medical advisers I advised Lord Castle Stewart to keep in the closest touch with His Majesty’s Legation at Jedda in view of the difficulties which the Saudis seemed in clined to place in the way of foreign practitioners at the moment. I advised him to look very closely into the regulations which had recently been issued in regard to medical practitioners and foreign dispensaries and to make quite sure of keeping within the law of such regulations. (Signed) J. C. STERNDALE BENNETT. The 10th August 1936. f Letter from the British Legation, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 267, dated 12th September 1936. I have the honour to refer to your printed despatch No. 215 of the 20th August transmitting the record of Mr. Sterndale-Bennett’s interview with Lord Castle Stewart and Mr. K. S. Twitched of the 5th August, and in accordance with your instructinons to furnish my observations on the various questions touched on during the conversation. 2. It is interesting to observe that the Saudi Arabian Alining Syndicate's London officials were apparently well-satisfied with the pro gress made so far in this country and that they had hitherto encountered no serious difficulties. The claim that the prospects at Wejh are en couraging is made here with some confidence, but as regards the Mahd- ad-l)hahab I have for some time derived the impression from certain members of the Syndicate’s personnel that the future of these workings depends entirely on whether an adequate water supply can be assured. That the London Board regard the question as one of great importance would appear from the fa^»- that since I reported on this subject in my despatch No. 225 of the 28th July last [S. No. (67)], they have sent out, r '■'■s'-58 at this somewhat unpleasant season of the year* two water specialists of different qualifications, one a Swedish geo-physicist (at a salary of £300 a month) and the other a British waterdiviner. The latter has now left ageiiin for the United Kingdom and I have recently heard that both experts have pronounced unfavourably on the prospects of finding water at the Mahd. This, if true (for it is as yet unconfirmed), might well dissipate dreams of an Eldorado in that particular area. 3. As regard Italian influence in Saudi Arabia, Mr. Twitchell’s opinion that the Saudis were deeply suspicious of the Italians is of con siderable interest. For my own part, I am impressed by the volume and unanimity of reports current in Jedda that the Italian Legation here is au mieux with the Saudi authorities, as I have reported in my despatch No. ‘259 of the 5th September, but I am unable to dismiss from my mind the impression created by Sheykh Yusuf Yasin, only two months ago, when he spoke to me, with a sincerity 1 found difficult to question, of his Government’s resolve not to grant the oil concession for the Farsan Islands to the Italians. The Saudi Government at that time resisted the pressure that was brought to bear on them here by the Italian Minister, a resistance which might well have caused them some embarrassment as they had not l° n g before accepted at the hands of the Italians, the gift of three aeroplanes. Perhaps the fact that, as far as I am aware, the remaining three aeroplanes have not yet arrived, may be attributed to Italian dis appointment over the oil concession. I therefore am inclined to share Mr. Twitchell’s opinion. I would certainly agree with the view that it would be impolitic to enter into any competition with the Italians for the favours of King Abdul Aziz, either in the supply of aeroplanes gratis oi in the training of Saudi pilots. 4. It is somewhat difficult to express an opinion on the fears of the Svndicate that Italians might at some future stage attempt to get hold of their landing-grounds. These, I understand, are now fairly numerous and have been established at Jedda., Mahd-ad-Dhahab, Wejh, \anbu, Dhiba and Taif, by special arrangement with the Saudi Government from whom they are leased. It does not appear that at Jedda, at least, there is any such menace, for the Saudi authorities, with, it is believed, Italian advice, are now engaged in laying out a large landing ground north-east of Jedda, in the vicinity of the Government’s Kandara villa, which, reports say, is also to be brought into use for the pilots and other personnel. If it is true, as reported in Jedda Report for June, paragraph 207, that the establishment of a chain of landing-grounds across Saudi Arabia is in contemplation (and in this connection it will be recollected that last year Ibn Sand was reported to be considering a postal service by air across his ^ kingdom, upon the return of his pilots from Italy), this would not seem to threaten the Syndicate’s landing grounds in such centres as We.ih, Yanbu and Dhiba. Their ground at Taif, moreover, is distinct from that ot the Government at that place. 5. The foreign personnel of the Syndicate have had an unfortunate record of ill-health since the commencement of operations. I am reporting bv this bag by my despatch No. 264 of the 10th September the death of Mr \V D Thomas Lieut. Royal Navy (Ret.) from the effects of heat, whilst on his way to the Mahd. I halve been informed here that the pre valence of sickness has been giving the London office much concern, and 1 understand that considerable expenditure has already been incurred in medical fees, etc. The Syndicate already maintain a full time medical officer an Indian, at the Mahd, but elsewhere they are at present dependent on local resources. These are more or less non-existence at Wejh, where they have a foreign personnel of about twelve, and are exiguous in Jedda, where there are two or three doctors attached to foreign missions. I had heard therefore, that the Syndicate had arranged to send out a Col. Mackie of the Ross Institute of Tropical Medicine in order to study health ^dh.ions at Jedda, Taif, Weih and the Mahd. He has not yet arrived here. 889(S) F&amp;PD59 6. I fully agree with the suggestion to present the results of any such investigation to the Saudi Government, although I fear that the prese Director-General of Public Health would regard himself as too conveisant with the conditions in this country to pay much attention to outs de advice. I also agree with Mr. Sterndale-Bennett s cautionaiy suggest o that the Syndicate should look very closely into Saudi regulations be ore committing themselves to maintaining a permanent medical staff here. But I feel that the idea is to be recommended, both frona the Syndicate so point of view, and for the more general reasons mentioned by Lord Castle Steward and .Mr. Twitchell. The Italians, again, are reported to have in view the establishment of an up-to-date dispensary here and the Italian Legation doctor, who is now away in laly, is credited with the intention of fringing staff and material back to Jedda with him. Here, however there would be less of the element of competition as between a commercial company and a Legation, than there would be m the case of the gift of aeroplanes. Moreover, there would be less opposition, I believe, oart of the Saudi authorities to a non-Government dispensary or medical Fnstitution of the sort than to those conducted in this country under the auspices of foreign governments. There would, too, be no question of their operations extending to Mecca. I should, therefore, on the whole be favourably disposed towards a proposal of this nature, viz , the establish ment of a permanent medical staff here, more particularly a B Jedda is badly off in its resources for medical treatment at present, and may be even more so before long, with Petroleum Concessions Ltd. bringing a new in flu y nf F.nroeans to this country. (83) Letter from the British Legation, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 260, dated 7th September 1936. With reference to my despatch No. 200 of the 7th July last, relative to the claim of the Imperial Bank of Iran against the al-Fadhl firm, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of an announce ment which appeared in the Mecca “Umm-al-Qura of the 4th September, on this subject. It will be observed that it corresponds closely to what was foreshadowed by Sheykh Yusuf Yasin in conversation with me in June last. I am taking steps to inform the Imperial Bank of Iran of the publica tion of this notice by the earliest mail. 2 T am sending a copy of this despatch and its enclosure to His Majesty’s Trade Commissioner, Bombay. TRANSLATION. Extract from the “Umm-al-Qura”, No. 613 of 4th September 1936. Announcement. In view of the fact that the guardianship of Sheykh Abdulla Mohammad-al-Fadhl over the minors of the late Saleh-al-Fadhl and over one third of his estate has been proved, and, as the said guardian has claimed that the properties under sequestration at Jedda known as “Muntazah” and “Huseynieh” were not the property of the firm of Ibrahim-al-Fadhl who is' under seizure but of the minors who have no connection with the firm of al Fadhl, the Government ha,ve handed over the said properties to the said guardian. He who has any claim or right thereof should approach the Sharia Court at Jedda with a view to proving his claim in course of one year to begin from the date of the first announce ment published in “Umm-al-Qura”. Any claim after the expiry of the said year shall be refused and not attended to. This is published for the information of all concerned.60 (84) Letter from the British Legation, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 259, dated 5th September 1936. I have the honour to report that, during the past few days, the Italian Legation, through its cavasses, has been engaged in distributing broadcast through the town of Jedda copies of two Arabic newspapers, the Barid Barqah, published at Benghazi, and Al adl of Tripoli. That the distribution has been lavish would appear from the fact that my Indian vice-consul obtained six copies of ea ( ch without any apparent difficulty. Apart from a totally incorrect report of 7,000 British casualties on the North-West Frontier of India (a report also broadcast recently from the Italian wireless station at Bari, causing some concern for a time amongst Indians resident here), the contents of these newspapers do not appear to be open to serious objection, their principal features being items of news of the progress of the Italian subjugation of Ethiopia; the reproduc tion of an article from the Egyptian Kowab-ash-Sharq on Italian Islamic policy, and referring in particular to the announcement by the Italian authorities that the Arabic language would be used in the courts of law at Harrar; and a number of photographs of Islamic institutions in Italian North Africa. 2. The dissemination in this way of Italian news, of a propagandist nature, is further proof of the interest now manifested by that country in Arabian affa*irs, an interest which my Italian colleague was said to have stressed, in referring to the friendly dispositions of his Government towards Arab nations, during his audience with Ibn Saud on the 10th May last, reported by Sir Andrew Ryan in his confidential despatch No. 146 of the 17th May. 3. Brief reference was made in Jedda report for August (paragraphs 263 and 286) Jo t*he unusual crop of rumours to which the visit of Arnir Feisal to Jedda on the 14th August gave rise. In all of these the Italians figured prominently, and in a favourable light. Three more aeroplanes were to arrive here, it was said, during the Amir’s visit; they were to be brought by an Italian man-of-war; and a high Italian personage was to accompany them presumably to hand over to the Saudi Arab Government, though some reports went so far as to state that he was to supersede Signor Persico (who has remained here this summer) as Italian Minister. These rumours, of course, died a natural death, but the impression in Jedda is, I think, general that the Italians are, for the present at least, on the most cordiad terms with the Saudi authorities. Incidentally, the original Italian offer of aeroplanes was of six machines, of which three only so far as is known, have been delivered. Three more, therefore, may be said to be overdue, and rumour is again busy, at the time of writing, prophesying their imminent arrival. 4.

In a recent talk with the Oriental Secretary, the Sa’udi Charge d’Affaires betrayed a marked suspicion of the frequent visits of semi official Yamani visitors to Iraq and evidently feared that the Iraqi Gov ernment, by encouraging such visits, were trespassing in what he regarded as the exclusive sphere of influence of King Abdul Aziz A1 Sa’ud. 4.

A three-engined Italian aeroplane arrived from Rome, November 4th apparently as present to Saudi Arabian Government.

(87) Letter from the British Legation, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 295, dated 27th October 1936. In my telegram No. 118, dated October 25th, I reported that Sheykh ■Yusuf Yasin had inquired privately whether His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to receive and to assist missions of young Saudis whom the Saudi Government wished to be trained in aviation. I now transmit a translation of his personal letter and a copy of my reply. 2. The history of awiation in Saudi Arabia is well known to you. My predecessor reported on the subject in detail in his despatch No. 176! dated June 8th. The present position, so far as my information goes, is this. Of the six Italian aeroplanes (make unknown) which it was believed were being presented to the Saudi Government by the Italian Government only three have arrived, and of these only one has been seen in the air at one time for some weeks past and two are stated to have received some slight damage. I have no information as &lt;to the use to which the machine presented by the French Government is being put. The old British machines (Wapitis) have not been used at all since the Italian aeroplanes arrived. The young Saudis who were sent to Italy for training seem to have returned nominally qualified to act as pilots, but little is known about their performance as Saudi “eagles”. So fair as my informatjon goes no Saudis have been trained as air mechanics, and this essential part of the functions of aviation is discharged by foreigners, viz., three White Russian refugees, and two Italians, who with an Italian' pilot- instructor, were sent with the Italian aeroplanes. 3. I was at first inclined to see objections to taking action on a private letter from Sheykh Yusuf Yasin. but I now see an advantage in this course since if the request cannot be encouraged by His Majesty’s Government, as I imagine it cannot, it can be rejected more easily than if it had been put forward officially.4. I have thought of many reasons as having perhaps prompted Sheykh Yusuf’s letter, though I hesitate to give greater weight to one rather than to another. Sheykh Yusuf is inclined to embark on little schemes of his own in the hope, probably, of making some small coup and winning credit thereby. Then the Italian experiment has come to the end of the lirst stage and it may be that the Italians are either reluctant to continue because of the poor quality of the students, or will not go on with it unless they receive some proof of Saudi friendship which Ibn Saud is reluctant to supply. (In this connection I may mention that the “Saut-ul-Hejaz” of October 20th, published for the first time pieces of Italian propaganda taken from one of the Arabic newspapers disti ibuted in Jedda by the Italian Legation). Or it may be that the relative success attained by the Iraq Air Force under British tuition has attracted Saudi attention i indeed, the commandant of the Saudi forces at Jedda recently praised the Iraq Air Force very highly in conversation with a member of the staff of the Legation . Or perhaps Sheykh Yusuf is courting a refusal so that we may be stopped from criticising Italian penetration in Saudi military affairs, 5 Whatever the motives behind the request, I do not suppose that it will appeal to His Majesty’s Government. It is unlikely that Saudi Arabia could produce five, still less ten to fifteen, young men every year who would make competent air pilots. It is possible that a few young men of good Nejdi origin could be found who, if they were put through a long complete course, would make creditable pilots, but I much doubt whether Saudi Arabia will be able for many years to come to provide men for a considerable air force, particularly the mechanics and other skilled artisans who would be required. I fear that the Saudi authorities are inclined to regard an airforce as chiefly a matter of pilots, and aeroplanes as being rather like gramophones whose handles anyone can be taught to turn. 6 I notice that in the conversation which the Air Officer Commanding, Middle East had with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 23rd April (reported m a despatch to the Air Ministry of which a. copy was sent to Jedda in Foreign Office despatch No. 130, dated the 14th May), he suggested tha.t the Saudi Government should send some young men to England or Egypt to be trained as mechanics. If any Saudis are to be trained for aviation under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government I suggest that it would be better that the training should take place in Egypt or Iraq, if this is possible, both because it would be cheaper for the Saudis and m particular because the students could not object if required to reach standards attained by other Moslems. But I doubt whether any arrangement that could be concluded would be satisfactory The Saudis would expect His Maiestv’s Government not only to teach their young men for nothing but nrobablv to keep them too, and if they agreed to pay for them the pay ments would always be in arrears and this Legation would have to dun tL Minister for Foreign Affairs. Nor is it likely that the students when trained would do great credit to His Majesty’s Government and any gratitude which we might win by agreeing to assist m the training of Saudi airmen would be dissipated if the returning eagles failed—even if entirely through lack of skilled machamcs—to give satisfaction to Ibn Saud. 7 Since this despatch was drafted I have received a copy of the descatch No. 1072, addressed to the Foreign Office by His Majesty s Charge d’Affaires at Rome on September 30th, in which it is reported that according to the “Vie dell’Aria” arrangements have been made to send fifty more students to Italy from the Hejaz. for training in aviation. This inclines me towards the last hypothesis set forth in paragraph 4 above. Tbn Saud may be committed, however unwillingly, to the arrangement by which Saudi airmen are to be'trained in Italy and may wish to protect himself against possible criticism on our part,by making a proposal which, accepted at all, could only be accepted on such financial terms as he B89(S) F&amp;PD if63 could reasonably say were too onerous for his slender budget. But if t knew my suspicion to be well founded I should still hesitate to recommend a scheme which in the long ruji would not I fear give satisfaction to either party. 8.

Letter from Sheykh Yusuf Yasin, Saud-i-Arab Kingdom, to Sir H. W. Bullard, British Legation, Jedda, dated 18th October 1936. I am glad to write to you this letter directly after I have had the honour of seeing His Majesty my Lord the King at Hail on my return rom Jedda. I am also glad to convey to you an expression of His Majesty s pleasure for hearing of the friendly conversations between us in the affairs we discussed and which I submitted to His Majesty. J am sorry my stay in Jedda was short and was not prolonged to enable me to speak to you of matters which we hoped may help for the promotion of the co-operation and collaboration between this eountrv and your friendly country. After my arrival my Government have begun to contemplate sending missions for education to be trained in aviation abroad, so I found it better to write to you this private letter asking for your assistance in approaching the British Government with a view to finding out whether they would agree to accept training such missions in their schools. The Mission which will be sent shall not exceed ten to hfteen persons a year and it will be annually year after year. I therefore shall be glad if you will be good enough to enquire about the necessarv terms and the help which the students may expect to get from the British Government m their training and the yearly expenses for each person. Hie purpose of such missions is to learn civil,and military aviation. I shall be grateful to Your Excellency if you would be good enough to furnish me with this information in the earliest possible convenience. Letter irom Sir R. W.

With reference to Foreign Office letter No. E.-6711/90/25 of 28th October enclosing, for the observations of the Air Council, a copy of tele gram No. 118 of October 25th from His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda regarding the desire of the Saudi Arabian Government to send a certain number of Saudi subjects to this country for training in civil and military aviation, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a despatch which iie has now received from Sir Header Bullard on this subject.- 2. Mr. Eden appreciate the arguments advanced by Sir Reader Bullard againstySheikh Yusuf Yasin’s proposal, but he considers that the vase for giving it sympathetic consideration is nevertheless a strong one. It may well be that the ordinary rather backward Arab from Saudi Arabia is unlikely to make a first class pilot. But the Iraqis have been able to produce a reasonably efficient air force under British guidance in a com paratively short space of time, and both Arabs and Egyptians have shown reasonable capacity to become good motor mechanics. In these circum stances the possibility of training Saudi Arabs to become adequate air pilots and mechanics should in Mr. Eden’s opinion not be ruled out except after full consideration. 3. Moreover, if His Majesty’s Government stand aside in this question and refuse to give the Saudi Arabian Government any assistance in res ponse to the present proposal a clear field will be left for other countries, who are prepared to incur considerable expenditure with a view to estab lishing their position and prestige in the Arabian Peninsula. Were His Majesty’s Govt, to adopt a policy which might be regarded as driving the Saudi Arabs into the hands of the Italians, for example, Italy might eventually obtain a privileged position in air matters in Arabia and thereby secure facilities for the establishment of an air route under Italian control from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf or from Egypt through Arabia to the Yemen. The Italians are extremely anxious to establish air bases on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea and in Arabia itself, and anything tending to make aviation in Arabia more exclusively dependent on Italy than it already is would go far to facilitate this object. Mr. Eden hopes that full weight will be given to this consideration. 4. Mr. Eden is aware that the Saudi Arabian Government do not dispose of sufficient funds to be able to pay large sums for the training of their pilots, and that cases have occurred in the past where great diffi- cultv has been experienced in collecting money due from the Saudi Arabian Government to His Majesty’s Government. But the repent grant by the Saudi Government of oil and mining concessions in Saudi Arabia has fur nished them with somewhat greater resources than they disposed of in the past, and, if they are Indeed anxious to develop their aviation, they may be prepared to ear mark part of the resources now available for this particular purpose. In any case it is for consideration whether the political and air issues involved may not be of sufficient importance to justify a contribution by His Majesty’s Government for the purpose of facilitating compliance with the present Saudi Arabian proposals. 5. In Mr. Eden’s opinion, if the training of Saudi Arabian pilots in this country should on grounds of expense or for any other reason prove impossible, the suggestion mentioned in paragraph 6 of Sir Reader Bullard’s despatch, that Saudi pilots might be trained under British suspices in Egypt or Iraq, is worthy of full examination. 6. I am to request that Mr. Eden may be furnished with the views of the Air Council on the whole question at an early date. 7 7. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Treasury and India Office.65 ( 88 ) Enclosures in Foreign Office covering letter dated December 9, 1931, Iso. E.-7172/5404/91. Letter from the British Legation, Jedda to the Foreign Office, No. 289, dated the 25th October 1936. I am now able to inform you that Mr. Philby, on whose movements I reported in my despatch No. 271, dated 22nd September, has reached Najran on the return journey and is expected to arrive in Jedda m about three weeks from now. 2. I have studied very carefully the despatch from Aden to the Colonial Office No.'1t92 Secret, dated 30th September, of which the Acting Resident has seht me a copy. Having known Mr. Philby for many years I should not be surprised if his comments on the question of the frontier between Saudi Arabia and the Aden Protectorate had been such as to give good ground for the reports enclosed in the abovementioned despatch, since in articles which he has written for magazines and newspapers he has openly urged that His Majesty’s Government should confine to the narrowest pos sible limits their claims on behalf of the various rulers round the coasts of Arabia. I share the opinion that Colonel Lake appears to hold, that Mr. Philby was speaking as a private person. Sir Andrew Ryan received more than one proof that Mr. Philby was not in the inner councils of lbn Saud, and it may be that Mr. Philby does not know that Ibn Saud s extreme claims on the southern frontier, as put forward during the recent discus sions, do not include “all the tribes between Najran and the Hadhramaut , still less any tribes or areas within the Hadhramaut. I cannot believe that Ibn Saud, while in the middle of negotiations on this point, would even desire still less authorise Mr. Philby to make the wild statements that are now attributed to him. If the Qatar affair is mentioned as an argument on the other side, I would point out that Ibn Saud from the beginning advanced claims in respect of Qatar such as he has never put forward during the discussions about the south-western frontier. Had I had the opportu nity I should have spoken of Mr. Philby’s activities to some representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but the nearest, of any importance, is at Hail. I do not wish to deal with the case in writing, if it can be avoid ed as that would enhance Mr. Philby’s importance, to his great satisfac tion and would be more apt than in conversation to give the Saudi Arab Government the impression that we believed him to be acting under then instructions or at least with their connivance. I have usually found Arabs quick to diagnose Mr. Philby as obstinately wrong-headed, and if 1 see Fuad Hamza or Yusuf Yasin it should be easy to refer to his wild state ments in the Hadhramaut as obviously irresponsible though nevertheless liable to create a regrettable impression on people under British protection and to mar the good relations between Saudi Arabia and Hm Majesty s Government, and to elicit a repudiation. I have no doubt that Mr Philby will express his views freely when I see him on his reurn, and what he says may serve as a guide to action. It is unfortunate that his return iournev is taking so long, and that the responsible Saudi officials are scattered over the Near East, but I think that to delay is better than to take up the question in writing before I l^ave seen either Mr Philby or some Saudi official with whom the matter can be discussed in a friendly manner. In coming to this conclusion I have not overlooked the fact that Mr. must have travelled with a considerable escort presumably provided by the Saudi authorities,' and that his talk of establishing a motor road gives his journey something of an official character. 3 If you wish a written protest to be made in any case you will doubt less crive me instructions by telegraph. And anyhow, if I remain cut off from* - personal contact with the Saudi Foreign Affairs officials for a consi derable time longer, I may be forced to take up the matter in writing unless general considerations seem to be strongly against that course.66 4. While this despatch was being drafted, Mr. Calvert had a conversa tion, recorded in a minute of which a copy is attached, with the engineer, Mr. Fearns, who assembles in Jedda the Ford cars imported by Mr. Philby’s company, Sharqieh Ltd. The statements made by Mr. Fearns, who is an honest, straightforward man, tend to show that the main object of Mr. Philby’s journey was archaeological research, though as Mr. Calvert points out, this does not explain Mr. Philby’s activities further south. Mr. Philby would he capable of using any occasion to engage in log-rolling on behalf of the ruler to whom he has paid many rather sycophantic tributes in his writings on Saudi Arabia. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch and its enclosure to Aden. Minute. Minister. I called on Mr. Fearns last night. He informed me that Mr Philby was still in Najran (he appeared to think it a place rather than a province and could give no clearer indication of Mr. Philby’s exact whereabouts)’ From this I gathered that he had heard again from Mr. Philby and that the later had halted for the time being. Mr. Fearns went on to say that he thought Mr. Philby s stay-in .Najran (and possibly the whole trip through to the Hadhramaut) was not unconnected with the search for ancient re mains. It appears that during the Saudi-Yemen war, Amir Baud, who was operating in Najran, discovered certian vestiges of early settlements. He later sent a party of men to Najran to excavate and these discovered the hpnd of a linn, in bronze, complete with one fore-paw. This was sent to Mr. Philby and Mr. Fearns himself packed it up and sent it to London. Mr. Fearns expressed the opinion that it was a good piece of work, and it was certainly an excellent piece of casting. II w^Ihis discovery, according to Mr. Fearns, that whetted Mr Philby s appetite for a trip south. The above may have some element of truth, but of course does not ex plain satisfactorily Mr. Philby’s activities further south. Dated 25th October 1936. , ( Sd ) A - s - C. (89) (E.7344/2617/91). I ■ - Ibn Saud and Italian Ambitions in Arabia. i ^ he Saudi Minister came to see me this evening and brought a very long confidential despatch in Arabic which he had just received from King Ibn j-aud. M Zada gave me the substance of the despatch as follows But he seemed to find unusual difficulty in translating it and in making the points m it clear. z. as -tiis majesty s u-overnment would have observed, Ibn Saud harl recently been consu ting them more and more frequently on questions of foreign policy. This was because (1) he considered that the toue interests of Arabia lay in friendship with Great Britain, (2) because he wanted to ahgn his policy as far as possible with that of His Majesty’s Government and (3) because he wished to do nothing which might cause His Maiestv’s Government embarrassment. But he appreciated that the questions which he asked them from time to time might also be embarrassing to them and he wished to know first of all whether His Majesty’s Government welcomed this attitude on his part, or would prefer that he did not consult them so or ten. despatch went on in this strain for some time, and then explain ed that Ibn baud waa very uneasy about the situation in various parts of Arabia, and in particular in the Yemen and in Iraq. Much propaganda was being carried on against His Majesty’s Government, who were being 889(S) F&amp;PD ~ - &amp;67 represented as the enemies of the Arabs, who were being incited to adopt a hostile attitude towards them in consequence. This propaganda had been carried on by the agents of four Powers in particular, viz., Italy, the Soviet Union, Germany and Turkey. 4. On my cross-questioning the Minister as to precisely what all this meant, it turned out that what it all boiled down to was that Ibn Saud was very uneasy about Italian propaganda in Arabia in general and about Italian intentions in the Yemen in particular. Ibn Saud explained that Italian agents were being particularly active in the Yemen, where they were, by bribes and propaganda, undermining the influence of the Imam. This might lead to the fall of the Imam, or in any case to the development of an extremely dangerous situation if the Imam should for any reason dis appear. Ibn Saud was anxious, if possible, to come to some understanding with His Majesty’s Government about the situation. 5. I waited until the whole of this document had been explained before replying. I then began by repeating, what I had often said before, that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciated and reciprocated Ibn Saud’s friendly feelings towards them, and appreciated in particular the way in which he wished to avoid any conflict of policy with them and from time to time consulted them on political questions with this object in view. There was certainly no reason why Ibn Saud should not continue to keep in touch with His Majesty’s Government on questions of policy, and His Majesty’s Government would always be glad to answer any questions he might ask them, whenever it was possible for them to do so. 6. As regards anti-British propaganda, the four countries which Ibn Saud had named as being responsible for it were in rather different cate gories. I was surprised to hear the Turks mentioned, as our relations with Turkey had recently been particularly friendly. At this the Minister explained that Ibn Saud was no doubt thinking of the past. I said that if this was so, it was no good raking it up, but that I found it rather difficult to believe that the Turks were really carrying on any anti-British propa ganda now. As regards Germany, she was of course keenly trying to deve lop and expand her commerce in the Middle East; while Soviet Russia was, by the nature of things, bound to carry on propaganda everywhere in favour of her political ideas; but it would be useful to know whether Ibn Saud had any special cases in mind. In reply to this, the Minister admitted that the only propaganda about which Ibn Saud was seriously worried was that of Italy. He did not seem inclined to follow up any of the other sugges tions, which may have been mere window-dressing. 7. I said that it was of course well-known that Italy had been carrying on a great deal of active propaganda all through the Middle East. We were well aware that this had often been violently anti-British— e.g., the broadcasts from Bari, etc., which were well known. Moreover it was clear that a good deal of Italian money had at one time or another been spent in such propaganda activities. In so far as they might be carried on in Saudi Arabia itself, only King Ibn Saud himself could deal with them. As regards such activities elsewhere, it would be useful to know whether Ibn Saud could give us any further details, and whether he had any definite suggestions to make. 8. The Minister replied that Ibn Saud had no definite proposals, but merely wished to bring the facts to our attention, particularly with regard to Italian intrigues in the Yemen. As regards Italian intrigues in Saudi Arabia, he would be very grateful for any information we could give him. I said that this might be difficult, since one might know that propoganda was going on and money being spent, when it was nevertheless not possible to quote chapter and yerse. With regard to Ibn Saud’s suggestion that we should reach some understanding with Ibn Saud with regard to possible Italian activities in the Yemen, I explained that the position was that His Majesty’s Government desired to see Saudi Arabia strong and independent, and to see the independence of the Yemen equally maintained. This prin ciple underlay the Anglo-Italian Understanding of 1927, the substance ofwhich had already been communciated to Ibn Baud, by which Great Britain and Italy recognised their mutual interest in seeing the independence of the Arab kingdoms maintained, and mutually renounced any intention of establishing themselves on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. Italy was thus bound by an understanding with His Majesty’s Government not to establish herself in the Yemen, and she would hardly be likely to violate that understanding unless as part of some major dispute, which would turn not on local Arabian but on major European political issues. What ever one might thing of the value of Italian promises—regarding which one might well be sceptical—there could clearly be no question of His Majesty’s Government reaching an understanding with Ibn Baud which would be based on the assumption that a friendly European Power was about to vio late and undertaking which it had assumed towards this country. 9. The Minister, after some conversation in Arabic with M. Zada, replied that Ibn Baud did not mean an understanding of this kind, but that he merely wished His Majesty’s Government to know that they could rely on him to support them in the event of Italy attempting any adventure in the Yemen in violation of her undertakings. I said that I would record what the Minister had said and submit it for consideration, but [ made it clear that, while we fully appreciated Ibn Baud’s attitude towards us and the dangers of the situation in the Yemen, we could not proceed on any assumption that Italy would disregard the Rome Understanding. 10. The Minister then reverted to the question of Italian propaganda in Iraq, but admitted that King Ibn Baud had nothing to go on and was merely puzzled and disturbed by what had recently happened in £hat country. 11. The upshot of a long and somewhat confusing conversation’seemed to be that Ibn Baud wished for some kind of assurance that we did not regard him as a nuisance; wished to warn us of Italian activities in the Yemen and of the danger threatening from that quarter, which would be greater to him even than to us; and seemed to hope to obtain from us some kind of undertaking to join with him in resisting any Italian attack on the Yemen, a suggestion which the Minister abandoned as soon as I indicated some of the obvious objections to it. 23rd November, 1936. !* (Signed) G. W. RENDEL, { (90) Letter from the Colonel Office to the Foreign Office, No 79086/36, dated 7th December 1936. With further reference to your letter (E. 1133/205/25) of the 7th of May on the subject of the Hejaz Railway, I now enclose a copy of a despatch dated 12th May 1936 from the High Commissioner containing his observations on the conclusions reached by the Haifa conference, considera tion of which in the Colonial Office has had to be postponed on account of many more urgent preoccupations. With regard to the crucial question of the method of financing the reconstruction of the line from Ma’an to Medina, the High Commissioner points out that the Palestine, Syria and Trans-Jordan sections are all running at a loss, and there is therefore no money out of which those sec tions of the line could finance the repair of the Saudi section. There are, of course, resasons for regarding the line as a single unit, but in the absence of any profit from the sections of the line in Trans-Jordan, Syria and Palestine, there is little likelihood of getting any contribution from any of those territories. There are no funds belonging to the Railway out of which contributions could be made, and the only way, therefore, in which a contribution could be obtained would be if the Governments concerned69 would piovide some money out of general revenues. Since there is a consi* derable loss on the Palestine and Trans-Jordan sections, those Govern ments could reasonably say that they have already done their share in res pect of the Railway by keeping the line open in their own territories and incurring a loss in so doing. There seems to be little likelihood of either Palestine, Syria or Trans-Jordan contributing anything towards the scheme, save that Trans-Jordan might undertake some responsibility in respect of the small section in its own territory, if the whole scheme were adopted. It seems to be equally unlikely that the Saudi Government will find the money at the present time. There appears to be no chance that the line will be a paying proposition, and one can hardly see the Saudi Gov ernment, which is notoriously short of money, providing £150,000 on which they would get no return. The unattractive commercial possibilities in turn seem to make it most unlikely that any private syndicate would undertake the work. It therefore appears that the only possible way of raising the money is that His Majesty’s Government should provide it. They certainly could not justifiably provide it on the grounds of the scheme’s commercial attrac tions, but it is conceivable that it might be possible to justify the expendi ture on political grounds. The Railway was destroyed during the Great War and it might be argued that, having regard to the history of its destruction and to its general interest to the Moslem world, and as a gesture to the Moslem world, His Majesty’s Government should undertake to repair it. Such a gesture might have considerable advantages at the present time. It would show the Arabs that we are very much interested in their welfare and it might be a means of counteracting the spread of Italian influence in that area. It may finally be worth consideration, whether the Railway could be regarded as of possible strategic value to His Majesty’s Government. In the event of a war with Italy, if Saudi Arabia threw in their lot with us, it might conceivably be a link in an alternative route to the Suez Canal. Do you think in the circumstances that there is a case on general political grounds for His Majesty’s Government undertaking to pay the cost of re pairing the Railway? If you think that there is a case, the next step would presumably be to bring the Treasury into consultation on the matter. If, on the other hand, you consider that there is no case, it is probably a waste of time to pursue the matter further as it seems extremely unlikely that any other source will assist to a sufficient extent to enable the money to be raised. The Railway has remained derelict for the last fifteen years without causing any great disturbance in the Moslem world and presumably it can remain derelict for a further period without any un toward results. As time goes on, the need for the Railway will probably become steadily less, since pilgrims will tend to go to Mecca more and more by motor routes.

C./69/35, dated 12th May 1936. 1 have the honour to refer to your Confidential despatch of the lOth January, 1936, regarding the conference held at Haifa in October, 1935, on the subject of the reconditioning of the Hejaz Railway. 2 Of the conclusions reached by the conference on the five points which formed the agenda, I have no comment to make on Nos. 1, 2, 4, and 5, save to endorse the recommendations of the conference. 3. As regards the third point, namely the manner in which the expenses necessary for the reconditioning of the line are to be met, I would observe that I am unable to endorse the recommendation of the Saudi re presentative, Fuad Bey Hamza, that the reconditioning of the damaged70 sections should be effected at the expense of the line as a whole. Apart from the political aspect arising out of the question of the ownership of the sections of the railway in different territories, there is the practical consideration that both the Palestine—Trans-Jordan section and the sec tion in Syria have no surplus funds whatsoever, while heavy expenditure for renewals will soon become necessary. The Gene ral Manager, Palestine Railways, informs me that if 7,000 pilgrims, each paying £P.12 for ia return ticket, were carried annually by the railway the costs of the restored line might just be covered and provision made for some maintenance, but there would be no margin for renewals. I think, however, that the estimate of 7,000 pilgrims put forward by the Saudi delegates is much exaggerated, for only relatively few pilgrims, from Syria, Iraq, Palestine and Trans-Jordan, with a few in transit from India, pass by this route. Consequently I can not suppose that His Majesty’s Government, or indeed any other source, would be willing to provide a sum of nearly £P. 200,000 for the repair of a line which could be expected to earn so inadequate a return. And if restoration of the railway has any value commercially it is almost exclu sively as a means to develop the northern Hejaz and to revive Medina, to that extent any financial liability should rest entirely on the Saudi Government. 4. I need hardly say that I should be very glad if an agreed means could be found for the provision of the required capital. Apart from the incidental benefits which might be expected to accrue to Palestine and Trans-Jordan, as explained in my despatch Confidential B of the 14th d une ’ 1934, I think that an agreement leading to the restoration of the line would favourably affect the political relations between His Majesty s Govern ment and King Ibn Saud. But His Majesty’s Government are better able than I to judge what weight should be given to this consideration. (91) Letter from the Colonial Office, to the Resident at Aden, dated 7th December 1936. I have the honour to refer to Lieutenant-Colonel Lake’s despatch Na 426 of the 2nd of September on the subject of the ownership by foreigners of immovable property in the Yemen, and to inform you that I have been in consultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the IIia 2 Under the Treaty of Sana’a, on which the treaty relations of His MaieVs Government with the Government of the Yemen are based, Hia Alaiestv’s Government have recognised the complete and absolute indepen dence of the King of the Yemen, who consequently is free to enact any, internal legislation he may wish. There is nothing in that Treaty to pre vent him Rom imposing restrictive legislation on British subjects in t e matter of their ownership of real property in his country, provided all foreigners are treated in the same way. . , , o 1 unaware of the le^al position of foreigners in the Yemen m the r'fof HeVerento^thf G^verS despaLh Kmg of the Yemen to tne Lxove however that ^ be contrary to d In this case therefore, I am of the opinion that British subjectb and 4.

A postponement of the operation of the Order or at any rate a provision that there should be a reasonable period for its operation, so as to avoid the simultaneous forced sale of a number of properties might be one way of attaining this end. I would refer you in this connection to Foreign Office despatch No. 153 of the 29th of May, 1935, to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, a copy of which was sent to you in Colonial Office confidential despatch of the 26th of June, 1935, on the subject of the Saudi regulations covering the ownership by foreigners of real property in the Hejaz. 5. With regard to the suggestion in paragraph 4 of Lieutenant-Colonel Lake’s despatch of a hint of reciprocal measures in Aden, I am advised that a hint of this nature would in effect be an empty threat, as His Majesty’s Government would be precluded from implementing it by virtue of paragraph 5 of the Treaty of Sana’a, which accords the principle of most-favoured-nation treatment to subjects of the Yemen. 6. I observe from the Political Intelligence Summaries that the opera tion of the decree is for the present being withheld, but you will no doubt be glad to have the foregoing comments for your future guidance. (92) Letter from the British Embassy, Bagdad, to the Foreign Office, No. 89, dated the 17th February 1936. r .T^^h re f e rence to my despatch No. 66 of February 6th, on the subject of the negotiations now being carried on in Bagdad for the conclusion of a treaty of alliance between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, I have the honour to m orm you that I learn from Mr. Edmonds, the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, that within the last few days Shaikh Yusuf Yasin has raised with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the three following questions :— (1) The delimitation of the Iraqi-Saudi Arabia frontier. (2) The abolition of the neutral zone at Tawal. (3) The conclusion of a new extradition agreement between the two countries. 2. None of these questions appears to involve any important British mteiest except possibly that of the delimitation of the frontier. I under stand from Mr. Edmonds that it is possible that the Iraqi and Saudi Governments will agree, that if inaccuracies are discovered in the geogra phical coordinates given to any wells, hills or other places mentioned* in the frontier described in the first protocol of Uqair, the delimitation com mission which the Saudi Government have suggested should be appointed, shall be guided in their work by the actual places rather than by the co ordinates assigned to them. A notable example is the Jabal Anaza. On the War Office map of 1/1,000,000, dated 1917-18, this, as you know, is shown on the intersection of latitude 32° north with longitude 39° east, whereas the latest surveys place it about 15 miles to the north-east of this point. 3. If, therefore, the frontier between Iraq and Saudi Arabia is made to end at the Jabal Anaza and not at the intersection of the lines of latitude and longitude mentioned above, some adjustment of the frontier between Transjordan and Saudi Arabia laid down in the Hadda agreement will presumably become necessary. This latter line is described as starting “from the point of intersection of meridian 39° E and parallel 32° N” and, unless it is altered, a considerable gap will be ieft between thf end of the Iraqi and the beginning of the Transjordan frontier lines. 4. Other misatkes, which, as you are aware, have latterly been detected in the 1/1,000,000 map, such as the position given to Judaidat al Arar and Mukur, would, Mr. Edmonds tells me, give rise to little trouble, astt e w“iM rib 1 ° f this 5 art cf the countr y have naturally observed as Standing nf P aC6 named ? ^ he U q ualr agreement and have no under- out &amp; tile inaccuracies tlie ma P which it was originally worked T ,\ e Saudi proposal regarding the Neutral Zone is that it should be , ,! he iT r es ? a ^ ls . hl 1 n ^ a front i er liae drawn straight from the iunction of the Wadi al Aujah with the Batin, to Bir Ausab. This proposal is being examined by the Iraqi Government, but as at present the only im portant feature of this territory is the watering places used by the bedouin tribes oi Nejd and Iraq, it does not appear that His Majesty’s Govern ment need be concerned as to the manner in which it is dealt with bv the two limitrophe governments. 6 - A o s regards extradition, Mr. Edmonds tells me that he understands that the Saudi Arab Government are asking for an agreement considerably wider in scope than that signed at Mecca in April 1931. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda and to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Beirut. Letter from the Foreign Office, to H. M.’s Ambassador, Bagdad, No. E. 981/52/25, dated the 11th March 1936, 1 ou may like to have a private word of explanation about our attitude towards the question of the frontier between Saudi Arabia and Iraq as developed in your official despatch No. 89 (17/25/36) of the 17th February. should explain in the first place that we have long been familiar with the discrepancy between the true position of the summit of the Jebel Anaiza as now surveyed on the ground and the geographical description of it— i.e., the approximate intersection of latitude 32 North with longitude 39 East- given in the Protocol of Uqair—a geographical description which is repro duced by itself in the Hadda Agreement. In our view there is no doubt what ever that the true summit of the Jebel Anaiza as now surveyed must be regard ed as the terminal point of the frontier, since the geographical co-ordinates are quoted in the protocol of Uqair merely as a supplementary or explanatory, and not as a substantive, definition. Indeed they are only mentioned as giving the approximate position. 3. The point is of considerable importance to us in connexion with the sector of the Transjordan-Saudi frontier laid down in the Hadda Agree ment. The negotiators of that Agreement plotted the frontier on the *1918 edition of the one in a million War Office international map, and, as so plotted and shown on that map, the frontier is a more or less reasonable one. It now turns out however that the physical features are in fact wrongly shown on that map in relation to the geographical coordinates, with the result that if the frontier were plotted on the ground or on a revised map purely in the light of the geographical coordinates quoted in the Hadda Agreement for purposes of definition, a new and most un satisfactory frontier in relation to the physical features would result. We are satisfied here that the Hadda frontier should follow as closely as possible the line drawn on the 1918 map in relation to the 'physical features as shown on that map, and that the geographical coordinates quoted in the Hadda Agreement should therefore be disregarded where they do not correspond tc that line. Our strongest legal argument in support of this view, however, is the fact that the North-Eastern terminal of the Transjordan-Saudi frontier must correspond with the North-W estern terminal of the Iraqi' Saudi frontier, and therefore, in view of the phraseology of the Protocol of Uqair, which defines the latter terminal, that it must lie at the true summit of the Jebel Anaiza and not at the purely geographical point men* tioned in the Hadda Agreement. Once this point is established the rest of the frontier will follow.4. All this of course is rather outside your immediate sphere, but I thought it might be useful to you to know that the establishment of the North Western terminal of the Saudi-Iraqi frontier at the true summit of the Jebel Anaiza and not at the geographical point mentioned as a supplementary definition in the Protocol of Uqair will be very definitely to our advantage, and very helpful to us in our negotiations with the Saudi Government about the Transjordan frontier. 5. As regards the neutral zone, the matter seems to be entirely one for the Saudis and Iraqis to settle between themselves, but our experience here, generally speaking, has been that neutral zones are an unmitigated nuisance, and that if they could be got rid of the situation is likely to be considerably simplified. They have in particular given us a great deal or trouble in connexion with recent negotiations for oil concessions in Arabia. 6. As regards extradition I was under the impression that the settle ment arrived at in Mecca in April, 1931, had been found to offer a very satisfactory solution of existing difficulties. I am not sure whether we are called upon to advise further in regard to it, but the Treaty Depart ment generally have rather strong views on extradition questions, and if you are in any doubt therefore you may like to send us a separate despatch on the point. Letter from the British Embassy, Baghdad, to the Foreign Office, No. 17/27/36, DATED THE 20th February 1936. With reference to my despatch No. 89 of February 17th, about the Iraqi Government’s negotiations with Saudi Araoia, I enclose a copy of a note prepared by Edmonds for his minister on tne Iraqi Saudi Arabia boundary and the neutral zone. In his covering letter Edmonds writes that he thinks that the Saudi proposals for the bisection of the neutral zone and the demarcation of the frontiers are not likely to be pressed, but that importance is attached by the Saudi delegation to the Dahamshah dispute and to the amendment ol the extradition agreement. Both of these are hardy annuals carefully cul tivated by Ibn Saud. They are, however, solely the concern of the Iraqi and Saudi Governments and I need not bother you with details. I learn from Yassin Pasha that the revival of these stale and antiquated differences has rather overcast the dawn of a new Arabian brotherhood which some optimists saw on the horizon and, in consequence, the treaty of alliance is being extensively redrafted. I gather that Yassin has done some plain speaking to Yusuf Yasin and has told him franklv that Saudi Arabia clearly cannot help Iraq effectively in any circumstances until she becomes more civilised and that, on the other hand' he must not imagine that Iraq will allow herself to be drawn willy- mily into any complications in which King Abdul Aziz may become involved with states either members or non-members of the League. Yusuf Yasin apparently asked wfiat Iraq would do if Saudi Arabia were to go to war with Great Britain; Yassin just told him not to be silly. SAUDI IRAQ NEGOTIATIONS: NOTE NO. 4. The Boundary. 1. 2. Shaikh Yusuf A1 Yasin has proposed : r d) that the Neutral Zone shall be divided between the two States; (h) that the boundary shall be demarcated. The relevant article in the Treaty of Muhammara reads as follows cording to Article 1 (a) the Muntafiq, Dhafir and Amarat belong to Iraq, similarly the Shammar Nejd belong to The wells and lands used from oy times by the Iraq tribes Nejd. tribes74 1 * ■% ) - shall belong to Iraq and the wells and lands used from old time by the Shammar Nejd shall belong to Nejd. In order to determine the location of these lands and wells and to fix a boundary line in accordance with this principle, a committee shall be formed consisting of two persons and presided over by a British official selected by the High Commissioner; the committee will meet in Baghdad to fix the final boundaries, and both parties will accept these boundaries without any objec tion. 3. The “Committee” provided for duly met at Uqair and fixed the final boundaries. The description is embodied in Uqair protocol No. 1. The characteristic feature of this description is that the boundary line is made to run in a series of straight lines between points named on the map, which are for the most part groups of wells. 4. With regard to proposal (a) my observations are as follows :— The neutral zone is a lozenge shaped area containing a large number of wells known as Tiw’al adh Dhafir, i.e., the deep wells of the Dhafir. In fact the Dhafir claim them all, even A1 Uqubba, the well at the southern obtuse angle. The lozenge is not perfect and a straight line joining the eastern and western acute angles would leave the greater area and the majority of the wells on the Saudi side, indeed most of the wells are situated in the southern obtuse angle. The proposal is definitely unfavourable to Iraq, would complicate the watering problems of the Dhafir and, in my opinion, should be rejected. It would however be desirable to define by agreement the method of adminis tration of the neutral zone. 5. The advisability or otherwise of demarcating the boundary was considered in 1927; at that time the verdict was that a demarcation would be unfavourable to Iraq for the following reasons:— (a) The traditional southern boundary of the Amarat, viz., the watershed dividing the Wadis draining northwards (known as the Widyan) from the wadis draining to the Wadi Sirhan lay considerably to the south of the line defined in the Uqair Protocol (e.g., the source of the Wadi Arar is in fact 100 miles south-west of Judaidat al Arar), and the watershed was at that time being observed as a status quo line; (b) The frontier from Qasr Uthaimin to the terminal point at Jabal Anaz was described in the Protocol as a straight line; but the description included mention of certain other points which appeared in the map then used (War Office I. M. 1917-18) to be situated on the straight line but, in the light of more recent information, were known to be really situated all to the north of the straight line between the terminal points. The boundary line would therefore follow not a single straight line but a series of straight lines running well to the north of it, i.e., even more unfavourable to Iraq. 5. It appears to me that these objections have today lost their force since:— {a) The Saudi agents are now aware of the places named in the Protocol and are working up to them; there is thus no status quo as distinct from the legal boundary; and (b) Objection (b) was always theoretical rather than practical, since both the tribes and the agents of the two Governments know the places named by their situation on the ground, and not in terms of geographical co-ordinates.75 6. Since the two Governments are anxious to remove all outstanding causes of friction, I incline to think that there would be certain advantages in demarcating the boundary. Theoretically Saudiya may stand to gain for the reasons given in para. 4; in practice Iraq would perhaps gain more, since Saudi zakat collectors would thereby be restrained from crossing into Iraqi territory as in the past, whereas there is no temptation for Iraqi Government agents to violate the boundary. 7. If it is agreed to demarcate the boundary, then it will be necessary to settle in advance one question of principle arising out of the defective drafting of the Uqair Protocol, the settlement of which would be beyond the competence of a Demarcation Commission. 8. The question is exemplified by the dispute regarding Judaidat A1 Arar. This is one of the points mentioned as lying on the line between Qasr Uthaimin and Jabal Anaz. The Saudi Government claims that Judaidat A1 Arar, as a point on the line, belongs equally to both states. The Iraqi Government claims that the ownership of wells mentioned in the Protocol as points on the line must be determined in the light of Article 1 (b) of the Treaty of Muhammara (quoted in para. 2 above). (My personal view is that the Saudi contention is correct, but the weight of administra tive and legal opinion in Iraq is against my view). It will therefore be necessary to refer this question (which covers all wells and tanks named in the description) to arbitration under the Protocol on Arbitration of 7th April, 1931. 9. The importance of the dispute referred to in the preceding para graph would be minimized if an agreement could be concluded whereby the ^ flocks of one party should be exempt from taxation by the other Party 'provided their stay in the territory of the other Party did not exceed two months. It would however first be necessarv to settle the dispute regarding the allegiance of contested tribes (see note No. 2). Telegram from Sir A.

He also continue discussion of points (1) and (2) mentioned in first paragraph of my despatch No. 89 of February 17th.

As soon as Fuad returned I asked for explanation of Philby’s entry into Aden protectorate without permission with armed Saudi escort. Today he called to give reply from Ibn Saud. I first informed him of complaints from the Imam about Philby’s entry into Yemen. (Aden despatch 544, November 7th). Reply. Begins : 2. Philby undertook to fix position of various points in Najran area and for this purpose was given customary guides (I interpolated 'and armed escort' and Fuad did not repudiate amendment). Saudi Arabian Govern ment did not know Philby was going further south and first learned that he had done so when they received from the Imam a protest against his76 entry into the Yemen. Philby had no authorisation from Saudi Arabian Government express or implied to go outside borders of Saudi Arabia. Ends. 3. On a map which is a duplicate one given Fuad for frontier dis cussions I showed Fuad that Shabwa was far south of Ibn Saud’s territory even if his extreme claims were conceded. Fuad did not deny Shabwa was in Aden protectorate. 4. Reply did not contain apology but I concluded that is because it would not fit in with rejection of all responsibility on (sic) Philby. 5. I gather that on his return Philby would be called upon by Ibn Saud to explain his conduct. You may wish me to inform Minister for Foreign Affairs that while the extraordinary occurrence is now understood His Majesty’s Government trust person whose irresponsible conduct might have caused serious incident harmful to the good relations between the two govern ments, will be suitably dealt with.

I have been instructed by His Majesty’s Government to request you to withdraw your Sa’udi armed party from the Aden Protectorate as soon as possible and to inform you that it would have been preferable for you to have informed British authorities of your intention to visit protectorate before your visit took place. Reference your signal of 2nd September. I appreciate that necessity took you into the Hadhramaut but as far as I am aware necessity did not take you and your Sa’udi armed party to Shabwa which is definitely within the Aden Protectorate. Further the Ahl Karab who roam the vicinity of Shabwa and whose Chief lives there are nominally vassals of the Upper Aulaqi Sultan (Handbook of Arabia). The recognised Northern boundary of the Aden Protectorate from near Dhala North eastwards is indicated by a N. E. line and is as you state undemarcated and to a great extent unexplored and the pohtical status of territory South of this line which includes Shabwa is not a matter for discussion as it is de facto under the protection of His Ma jesty’s Government. The Bal Harith tribe N. E. of Beihan Al Qasab are under the Sharif of Beihan who is a treaty Chief, and I must request you with your Sa’udi armed party not to enter Beihan territory including that of the Bal Harith unless traverse across a portion of the latter is necessary for topographical reasons, and should you desire to visit Beihan yourself unaccompanied by armed Sa’udis to inform me before you leave Mukalla. Your spare parts should leave Aden tomorrow. Enclosure 8 to S. No. (1). Cypher telegram from the Resident, Aden, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. 71, dated 9th September 1936.

As far as is known both of these places are well within Hadhramaut (please refer to Reilly’s tele gram of the 19th March).

I returned yesterday from a visit by air to Mukalla and the Hadhramaut valley. 3. In the course of my visit I was able to make enquiries on the spot as to the extent of Mr. Philby’s Sa’udi propaganda though enquiries were scarcely necessary as both the Qu’aiti authorities at Mukalla and Shibam, and the Kathiri Sultan and influential Seiyid family of Al Kaf in the Eastern part of the Hadhramaut valley were only too ready to open the subject without en couragement and to talk about what they considered as Mr. Philby’s unwar rantable interference.4. I found that Mr. Philby had spared no pains to proclaim the merits of Sa’udi Government at every opportunity and to assert how well the people of the Hadhramaut would fare were they to come under the rule of Ibn Sa ud. Mr. Philby declared the country between the Western boundary of the Hadh ramaut and Najran to be a “No man’s Land ” which would soon be taken over by Ibn Sa’ud. This includes Shabwa and A1 ’Abr, of which Shabwa (which is actually more to the South than shewn on existing maps) is inside the Protectorate both tribally and geographically, while A1 ’Abr (which is on the main route from Najran to the Hadhramaut) is also well within the violet line and is in the territory of the Ahl Sei’ar (Sir Bernard Reilly s Secret telegram No. 20 of 19th March 1936 and Mr. Ingram’s report—Chapters I and XIX). I have no reason to doubt the truth of the statements made to me which were given by responsible and reliable persons. 5. Mr. Philby also spread abroad that Ibn Sa’ud “ intended to make a road for motor traffic from Mecca to the Hadhramaut , as already reported. I have not the opportunity in this despatch to comment on the advantages of such a road being constructed. But were such a scheme to be considered it would be a matter for His Majesty’s Government to discuss with the Sa’udi Government, and for Mr. Philby to proclaim that Ibn Sa’ud “intends” to make the road, as if the country immediately to the West of the Hadhra maut was Sa’udi territory and not part of the Aden Protectorate, is gross impertinence. 6. I do not think that much attention was paid to Mr. Philby’s Sa’udi propaganda by those who really count in the Hadhramaut and Qu aiti terri tory and possibly the visit of the Air Officer Commanding and myself with five aircraft immediately after Mr. Philby’s visit counteracted to a certain extent its effects. But there is always a faction in most communities who are anti-Government and an easy prey for foreign intriguers and the Hadhramaut is no exception, added to which there is an Irshadi element which has for some years been trying to overthrow the influence of the Seiyids of the Hadhramaut and to spread the tenets of the Wahabi faith. I, there fore take a serious view of the diffusion of any determined Sa’udi propaganda in the Hadhramaut such as that in which Mr. Philby has recently been engaged. 7 I am not in a position to give an opinion as to whether Mr. Philby’s recent activities had the support of Ibn Sa’ud. Mr. Hope Gill, who has known both for some years, thinks not. Possibly Mr. Philby’s apparent desire to cover the whole' of Arabia in the course of his travels and to try to be the first European to cross an unexplored route or to visit a town of historical interest (in this case—Shabwa) may have furnished the real reason for his recent journey and that, being such an ardent admirer of Ibn Sa’ud, he could not resist the temptation to proclaim aloud the virtues of his hero, but, in view of the conversations now being conducted by His Majesty’s Government with the Sa’udi Government over the boundaries of Sa’udi Arabia, and of Ibn gaud’s tendency to claim more than His Majesty’s Government is willing to cede it is quite likely that Mr. Philby’s intrigue may have had the unofficial, if not the official, support of the King, and that it was financed by the latter {vide last paragraph of Royal Air Force report enclosed). In any case, as Mr. Philby is the proteg^ of Ibn Sa’ud, I assume that His Majesty’s Government will take up this matter with the Sa’udi Govern^ ment and address a strong protest. 8. Presumably Mr. Philby still calls himself an Englishman and I under stand that he is in receipt of a pension from the Government of India. It is all the more to be deplored, therefore, that he should deliberately work against the interests of Great Britain. 9 I enclose copies of two recent reports—one from the Intelligence branch of Air Headquarters (which is probably rather exaggerated as re gards the paragraphs 4 and 5) and the other from His Highness the Sultan of Shihr and Mukalla.Enclosure 10 to S. No. (1). El Haj Abdulla Peilby : activities in the Hadhramaut. It is reported by Sheikh Omer Baobeid, a well-known merchant in Aden, who arrived from his country (Shibam) last week, that El Haj Abdulla Philby stayed many days at Shibam and told the people there that the object of his visit was to open a motor road from Nejran to the Hadhramaut and to encourage the trade in Ford cars, as he is a Ford Agent in Hejaz. He praised highly Tbn Saud, Abdul Aziz, and advised the Aqils and Sheikhs to proceed to Hejaz and to conclude a treaty with Abdul Aziz, as the latter is willing to accept this and will do his best to please them in everything. In the Hadhramaut most of the people were astonished to hear this and replied that their country was under British protection. He told them it was wrong to say that, as the Hadhramaut is an independent country and they had a lot to gain by concluding a treaty with Ibn Saud. He also said that from Nejran to the border of the Hadhramaut all the tribes agreed to be under Saudi protection. He tried to convince the Hadhramaut people of the generosity of Ibn Saud and advised them to take this chance and to accompany him back to Hejaz. He spoke ill of the British Government’s policy and indicted the British for their cruelty towards the Arabs of Palestine. He used his radio daily whilst there and allowed anyone who wished to hear it. His radio apparatus is said to be of a very costly type and can work from one battery for a thou sand hours. It is said that last year some of the Aqils of the Hadhramaut visited Ibn Saud and returned to their country praising the Sultan’s generosity. Three of the head Sheikhs of the well-known Hadhramaut tribe of Saar, accompanied Philby to Hejaz to visit the Saudi Sultan. Philby had with him three Ford cars (two lorries and a four-seater). He came to the Hadhramaut with the small car and one lorry; the second lorry was kept at Shubwa. He was very modest and generous and the Hadhramaut people liked him very much. Enclosure 11 to S. No. (1). Letter from His Highness the Sultan of Shihr and Mukalla, to the Acting Resident. After our arrival at Mukalla we interviewed Sheikh ’Abdullah Philby on several occasions. We gathered from his conversations with us that he highly praises the Sa’udi Government in a way which signifies a spirit of propaganda in their favour. It was clear from information received from the persons with whom he had interviews both at Mukalla and Hadhramaut, that he had spread pro paganda in favour of the Sa’udi Government. He also told many persons that the Sa’udi Government are prepared to render assistance to the Hadh ramaut if the people ask for it. He also explained that the tribesmen living beyond A1 ’Abr have all entered into an agreement with the Sa’udi Govern ment and that no one will dare to interfere with any traveller while on his way from A1 ’Abr to Mecca. While this does not coincide with the true facts (because Sheikh Philby himself was not able to pass through the borders of the tribesmen living beyond A1 ’Abr except by means of an escort from them) yet propaganda of this nature creates anxiety in the minds of the people, and this necessitates the taking of precautionary measures. Similarly the opening of a road for motor traffic between the Hadhra* maut and Najran in the manner prescribed by Sheikh ’Abdullah Philby calls for precautionary measures also on account of the results which might be brought about by the opening of such a route. Apart from the fact that no 50(C) ExAffaireDept6 i one of the Hadhramis would be able to travel by this road except by experiencing great difficulties and incurring heavy expenses, the Hadhramaut itself would not gain anything by the opening of this road. We therefore wish by means of the assistance of His Majesty’s Government to take such precautionary measures as may ensure the safety of the borders. We assure you that there exists no relationship between our Government and the Sa’udi Government other than the Islamic-Arab ties. While we have regard for this tie we do not in any way wish them to do anything which would •disturb our minds. We welcome the visit of any mission from them at any time they like to visit the Hadhramaut on condition that they obtain permis sion from His Majesty’s Government at Aden and ourselves. The visits of armed missions to the Hadhramaut without previous information or per mission are not appreciated. We should like to bring to your notice that the Irshadiyan Community in the Hadhramaut and Java may have some connection with the Sa’udi Government. There are in this community many of the Ahl Kathir. Per haps even the Irshadiyan Community might have had a hand in the arrival of Sheikh Abdullah Philby to the Hadhramaut for at the very time in which Sheikh Abdullah Philby came to the Hadhramaut, there appeared from the Kathiri Irshaid Community a notification both on the coast and in the in terior of the Hadhramaut containing a clear call to the people to join the Flag of the Sa’udi Government. You will find herewith a copy of the notifica tion attached to this letter for your perusal. The issue of such a notification necessitates the watching of the activities of the Kathiri Community at Java. We request you kindly to think carefully over this matter. We shall watch those around us in our part. Enclosure 12 to S. No. (1). Letter from the Acting Resident, Aden, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. 521, dated 21st October 1936. I have the honour to refer to my secret despatch No. 492, dated 30th September 1936, and to enclose for your information a copy of a letter dated 9th October 1936 from the Upper ’Aulaqi Sultan regarding the recent acti vities of Mr. Philby in the Aden Protectorate. 2. The Wadi Ham mam and the district of Markha are situated in the ter ritory of the Upper ’Aulaqi Sultan; (reference my telegram No. 62 of 24th August), and it will be noted that Mr. Philby is reported to have arrived in Wadi Hammam on 30th September. My telegram to Mr. Philby requesting him to withdraw his party from the Aden Protectorate was dated 7th September and Mr. Philby replied on 10th September in a telegram which led one to believe that he was leaving Mukalla on that day for Shabwa to act accordingly. It is therefore apparent that, if these reports are true (and I have no reason to doubt them), Mr. Philby deliberately disregarded the request to leave the Protectorate and act ually penetrated further in. 3. I am replying to the Upper ’Aulaqi Sultan that the Sa’udi party entered the Hadhramaut and other parts of the Protectorate without per mission, that the Sa’udi Government has not been given authority over the interior of the Hadhramaut and that there is no intention of giving them permission to enter ’Aulaqi territory. I shall add that His Majesty’s Govern ment is well aware of the loyalty to them of the Sultan and his people and shall express a hope that friendly relations between His Majesty’s Government and himself and successors will always be maintained. I am also taking advantage of his letter, after consultation with the Air Officer Commanding, to suggest and recommend the construction of a Landing ground near Shabwa, # * * it r *7 4. As His Highness the Sultan of Lahej has informed me that it is the general opinion in the Protectorate that Mr. Philby and his party had the per mission of His Majesty’s Government and this Residency, I am having a paragraph published in the Aden Protectorate Gazette denying this. I am forwarding a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda. Enclosure 13 to S. No. (1). Letter from the Upper Aulaqi Sultan, to the Political Secretary, dated 9th October 1936. We WTite this to inform you, oh friend, that a European with Sa’udi soldiers arrived at Shabwa some time back. We thought that they were mere travellers but they prolonged their stay at Shabwa. On 14th Rajab (30th September 1936) they arrived at Wadi Hammam with the intention of entering Markha but they were not allowed to do so by the Nasiyi tribe and therefore they returned to Shabwa which is situated on the trade route through which our merchandise passes to Hadhramaut. We are afraid that our subjects and caravans proceeding to Hadhramaut may be harmed. We request Government kindly to inform us whether the Sa’udi Govern ment have been given any authority over the Hadhrami interior. As far as we ’ Aulaqi s are concerned, we do not wish them to enter our country at all because we are already in treaty relations with the British Government and do not wish to enter into any engagement with any other Foreign Govern ments we are maintaining our friendly relations with the British Government. We request the British Government to reply to us on this subject as soon as possible. Enclosure 14 to S. No. (1). Letter from the Acting Resident, Aden, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. 538, dated 28th October 1936. I have the honour to refer to Colonel Lake’s telegram No. 86, dated 23rd October 1936, and to enclose, for your information, copies of letters dated 8th and 14th October 1936 from Seiyd Ahmed bin ’Alawi A1 Jifri and Seiyid Nasir bin Muhshin respectively regarding the recent activities of Mr. Philby in the Aden Protectorate. 2. Seiyid Ahmed bin ’Alawi A1 Jifri is a member of an important family of Mansabs (Religious overseers) in the Upper ’Aulaqi country, where he is an influence for law and order, and Seiyid Nasir is one of the Chiefs of Mar kha. 3. Place references will be found in San’a map, North D. 38. 4. A notice has been inserted in the issue of the Protectorate Gazette for October that no permission of any sort was accorded to Mr. Philby for his journey into the Protectorate and that His Majesty’s Government lends no countenance whatever to the statements he is reported to have made there. Enclosure 15 to S. No. (1). Letter from Seiyid Ahmed bin Alawi Al Jifri, to the Second Political Officer, Aden, dated 8th October 1936. News reached us, oh friend, about the arrival of Mr. ’Abdullah Philby with his companions at Shabwa on the 8th Rajab (24th September 1936) and on the night of the 11th instant (27 September 1936), they were the guests of the Hammam tribe. They wanted to go to Markha but they were not allowed to do so by the Nasiyin tribe. One of the motor cars which arrived went to the lower part of the Khalifi country to a place called As-Sod to hunt8 * 7 gazelles and they killed one. They also went to the lower part of Jedan belonging to the Ahl Dhabab. It may not be hidden from your honour that the people of that part of the country were disturbed and frightened on account of this Saudian raid against the Protectorate with the consent of the British Government. But if they (British Government) are backing us, we do not care either for the Sa’udi or Imam. A letter prior to this has been sent to you and we hope it has reached you. Every tribesman is afraid of Sa’udi incursions and the subjects only want those who will look into the maintenance of peace whether they be the British Government or any Isla mic Government. Enclosure 16 to S. No. (1). Letter from Seiyid Nasir bin Muhshin of Markha one of the Aqils of Markka nominally under the Upper Aulaqi Sultan, to the Political Secretary, Aden, dated 14th October 1936. We inform you, oh friend, that two lorries arrived as far as the borders of Markha. They asked us for permission to enter our country and to have an interview with us. We declined to grant their requests. They say that they belong to Najd and have come on behalf of Bin Sa’ud. Enclosure 17 to S. No. (1). Letter from the Acting Resident, Aden, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. 544, dated 4th November 1936. I have the honour to submit a copy of a letter received from the King of the Yemen on the subject of Mr. Philby’s recent journey to the Hadhramaut in the course of which it now appears that he travelled without leave through Yemeni territory. ° 2. Captain Seager, who has now returned to Aden from his visit to San’a reports that the King has been both offended and alarmed by Mr. Philby’s passage through his country. It is well known that the King has the strongest objection to the entry of any foreigners into any part of the Yemen without his previous knowledge and permission, and this Residency is always careful to respect his wishes in this respect. Mr. Philby’s arrival within Yemeni borders without authority having been obtained or even sought is therefore both an affront to the Y emeni Government and an embarrassment to the Aden Residency, through which the visists of British subjects to the Yemen are usually arranged. His inconsiderate and discourteous action has become a more serious offence through the fact that he was accompanied by an armed party and that he appears to have indulged in propaganda unfriendly to Yemeni interests. These circumstances suggest a challenge on his part to Yemeni Sovereignty over the districts mentioned in the King’s letter to me. v_/ A A .l. v/ • 3. The districts in question are A1 Jof and Marib. These have been m Yemeni occupation since 1926 and 1927 respectively. They lie to the smith of the Saudi-Yemeni frontier established by the Treaty of Talf in 1934 and are well to the north of the boundary of the Aden Protectorate. There appears therefore to be no valid reason to question the Yemeni claim to them whmh has been enforced m fact for several years, and it is prejudicial to good Anglo - Yemeni relations that this claim should appear to be disputed by a British subject, and especially by one who was formerly in the service ol the British Government and who is still regarded by many Arabs as occu pying a quasi-representative position in Saudi Arabia. '“N9 * r% 0 •k Enclosure 18 to S. No. (1). In the name of God, the Compassionate, the merciful, 2nd Shaaban, 1355, (October 21st 1936). From His Majesty the Imam Yahya bin Muhammad Hamid-ud-Din, to His Excellency Sir Bernard Beilly, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., O.B.E., Besident, etc. We extend to your Excellency our respects. We beg to call your kind attention to an incident which we regret to report to Your Excellency and which has happened during your absence from Aden on leave. This incident has caused all kinds of doubt and un easiness in all parts of the country and a great deal of surprise and amaze ment due to our ignorance of its reason. Mr. Philby, wl o has chosen to reside in the Hejaz for some years, claimed in the month of July last to be the representative of Great Britain and thus earned for himself the immunities and privileges accorded to PoUtical Bc- presentation. He brought a group of armed men and, with them, crossed the Yemini Boundary in cars near Najran and came down to the Hadhramaut where he told them (the Hadhramis) different stories. He claimed that he would construct a motorcar road between the Hejaz and the Hadhramaut and that he would erect in some places stations and buildings. We have heard from certain people that Mr. Philby encouraged our people to take aggressive measures against the Yemeni Government and its territories. He entered Marib and Jof and said different things. Mr. Philby is a British sub ject and is still under British protection. His entrance into our country with armed men without permission violates international regulations as does his wandering about within our country and the making of declarations against our Government. His strange conduct has excited our people and we are sure that Great Britain never permits or encourages any such unwarranted behaviour. We therefore earnestly beg Your Excellency to request your Govern ment, w r ho is aware of every single thing that happens, to inquire carefully into the matter and to be good enough to inform us of the real reason for this strange incident. We also request the British Government to inflict a suitable punishment on Mr. Philby and to assure the non-repetition of such an incident in the future. In conclusion w e extend our respect and wishes for jmur good health. Enclosure 19 to S. No. (1). Cypher telegram from the Acting Besident, Aden, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. 67, dated 31st August 1936. (Bepeated to Jedda). My telegram No. 64, dated the 30th August. Philby with two Saudi servants is at present in Mukalla which he reached via Terim and Shihr while his main party is in Shabw r a. Apparently one of his cars broke down near Shibam and he has now telegraphed to Aden for spares w hich will be forwarded to him. I have asked him to inform me of his future movements.

You should also infoim 55(C) ExAffairsDept. *him that in any event it would have been preferable for him to have informed British authorities of his intention to visit Protectorate before visit took place. Enclosure 21 to S. No. (1). Letter from Secretary of State, Colonial Office, to Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, No. 78150/36, dated 19th November 1936. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Ormsby Gore to refer to the letter from this Department of the 7th November enclosing copies of correspondence relating to the activities of Mr. Philby in the Aden Protectorate and to transmit to you, for the information of Mr. Secretary Eden, a copy of a further despatch and enclosure from the Resident at Aden. 2. Mr. Ormsby Gore is of opinion that the reports contained in this and pievious despatches, copies of which have been transmitted from time to time to the Foreign Office, are sufficient indication that Mr. Philby did not confine his activities in the Aden Protectorate to those of an ordinary travel ler, but that in the course of his visit he persistently spread political propa ganda in favour of the Saudi Government. Mr. Ormsby Gore further con siders that the circumstances justify a strong protest being made to the Saudi Government, and I am accordingly to request that, if Mr. Eden sees no ob jection His Majesty’s Representative at Jedda be instructed to make repre sentations on the following lines :— (1) His Majesty’s Government consider that it was in any circumstances impolitic and discourteous on the part of Mr. Philby to enter the Aden Pro tectorate accompanied by Saudi personnel without first informing the Re sident at Aden and seeking permission, and that in the present case, in which the Saudi party which accompanied him was armed, his action was quite unwarrantable. In spite of the Acting Resident’s request that he should withdraw his party, he deliberately attempted to penetrate further into the Protectorate. (2) It is apparent that Mr. Philby, in the course of his journeys in the Protectorate sought to convince the people of the advantages which would accrue to them if they were to come under the rule of the Saudi Government, and even suggested that the Saudi Government would be prepared to render assistance to them if it were asked for. He generally gave the impression that parts of the Protectorate were a “ No Man’s Land ” which would 'one day be absorbed into the Saudi Kingdom. In his statements concerning the designs of the Wahabi King to construct a motor road from Mecca to the Hadhramaut, he appears to have ignored the fact that before any such work w^ere undertaken it would first be necessary to consult the British Govern ment, since a large part of the territory through which the road would pass is under the protection of His Majesty. L (3) H is clear that Mr. Philby’s visits to certain of the local Sheikhs were unsolicited and that his activities in their territories were regarded by them as being an unwarrantable interference in their local affairs. More over, the statements which he made appear to have given rise to a feeling of apprehension amongst certain of the local Sheikhs that some arrangement tor the control of this area might have been reached, unknown to them bet ween His Maiesty s Government and the Saudi Government. It appears that this teelmg was shared by the King of the Yemen. In view of the en tirely false impression created by Mr. Philby it was found necessary to insert a notice in the issue of the Protectorate Gazette for October to the effect that no permission of any sort was accorded to Mr. Philby for his journey into the Protectorate and that His Majesty’s Government lent no countenance whatever to the statements he was reported to have made there. T&gt;u-n —J - 1CC1 altitude adopted by Mr. I hilby and the statements made by him during his visit to the Protectorate are not in accord with the friendly relations existing between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government.11 ( 2 ) {Received on 23rd January 1937 with Political S^retary's letter No. 1, dated 7th January 1937).

With reference to your telegram No. 93 of the 17th September, enquiring whether any light can be thrown from Jedda upon the activities of Mr. Philby in the Hadhramaut, I have the honour to report that no information of any kind has come to the notice of the Legation, from local sources, save that since the receipt of your telegram under reference enquiries made from Mr. Philby’s firm of Sharqieh Ltd. have elicited the fact that they have recently received a letter from Mokalla in which Mr. Philby stated his intention of returning to the Hejaz via Najran. I consider it unlikely that the clerk in charge of Sharqieh Ltd. knows anything more than the bare facts of his employer’s movements. J 2. It will be observed from paragraph 196 of Jedda Report for May last, thcit Mr. Philby w&amp;s reticent 3/bout his plans, before departure on this journey but that Sir Andrew Ryan derived the impression that the undertaking was one of Mr. Philby’s periodical journeys of exploration. 3.

With reference to Mr. Calvert’s Confidential despatch No. 239 of the 5th September last, I have the honour to report that the Italian Legation has recently distributed locally further copies of the Barid-al-Barqa, the newspaper in Arabic published at Benghazi. Copies dated 16th and 24th August and the 8th September have come to my notice. 2. Much of the news contained in these three issues is not worth report- mg in detail. In that of the 6th September, however, is a leading article en- titled : Pacific Policy of Italy: Renewal of Freindship between Italy and W ^ c k a reference is made to the extension of the treaty of 1926, between the two countries, for a further period of one year (until November 1937). This is claimed as proof of the friendly disposition of the Fascist State towards Arab countries generally, with whom Italy desires to promote economic relations based on respect for their institutions and for their inviolability. The article alludes to the circulation in the press in some Arab countries of reports that Italy intended to attack the Yemen, and de clares it superfluous to publish further denials of such reports (which it attri butes to unspecified foreign sources), in view of the Duce’s pronouncement that Italy will now confine her activities to the peaceful development of Ethiopia. ^ 3.

I have the honour to inform you that the Minister for Foreign Affairs told me this morning that during his recent visit to Riyadh he had presented to King Abdul Aziz, on behalf of King Ghazi, the insignia of the Hashimite Order. This consists of a finely worked gold and enamel collar and it is bes towed only on the Heads of States. 2. Dr. Naji Beg also informed me that he had been entrusted by King Ghazi with the task of conveying to the Amir Sa’ud an invitation to pay an official visit to Iraq.

Personal letter from British Legation Jedda, to His Royal Highness the Amir Feysal, Mecca, No. 2102/316/55, dated 6th December 1936. I have the honour to address Your Royal Highness upon a matter which I treated orally with His Excellency Fuad Bey Hamsa and should have preferred to continue to treat orally, only His Excellency has left Jedda and may not be back for some time. The question is the journey of Mr. Philby into the Aden Protectorate with an armed Saudi force without notice having been given to the Protectorate authorities beforehand. I duly reported to my Government the assurance of the Saudi Arab Government that they did not know Mr. Philby intended to go south of Naj- ran, and that he had no authorisation from them, whether express or implied, to proceed with the armed force outside the borders of Saudi Arabia. His13 Majesty’s Government were very glad to receive this assurance, which con- farms the supposition which they had already formed on the subject, and they now understand the extraordinary occurrence. I am however to point out that the arrival of Mr. Philby in the Aden Protectorate with an armed Saudi force might have caused an incident or on the other hand might have led the tribes in those parts to suppose that Mr. Philby had come on a mission from the Saudi Arab Government, either of which results would have been harmful to the good relations which have subsisted for so long between the two governments. In conclusion I am to inform Your Roval Highness that His Majesty’s Government trust that suitable action will be taken in regard to the person whose irresponsible conduct might have led to so regrettable a consequence.

Reply from Minister for Foreign Affairs to my personal letter of December 8th [S.

My statement concluded thus. [gp. undec. we might be in] Najran, though, Philby as an explorer would be use ful to Saudi Government and he was acting in a manner as their employee (Fuad nodded assent), and in any case to steal away without their know ledge with an escort granted for that prupose and to use it to enter Aden protectorate was a nasty trick and we expected Saudi Government to tell him so.

I have the honour to report that, after the exchange of notes on the 3rd October, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin asked whether he could see me about ceitain other questions, and it was arranged that he should call at the Legation on the 5th October. He had already asked whether I wished to continue the dis* cussion of the Koweit and frontier questions or would prefer to await tho return of Fuad Bey Hamza, which was expected to occur very soon, and I told him that the Saudi counter-draft of article 1 of the proposed Koweit 65(C) ExAffairaDeptregulations against smuggling was being considered by His Majesty s Govern ment, and that, as to the other matters, it would perhaps be well lor me to wait until Fuad Bey’s return, since I was new to the post, and needed as much time as possible to make myself fully acquainted with the ^vant hies. Sheikh Yusuf had made no objection to this, and had concluded that all ques tions of major interest were therefore in abeyance, and that on the 5th October he would discuss minor questions at issue, such as the blacklisting of certain pilgrim guides. He, however, embarked upon a long statement on foreign affairs, which, he said, he had been charged to make by His Majesty King Abdul Aziz. He spoke very carefully, hesitating from time to time, as though to recall Ibn Sand’s exact words. The statement, however, w^as so clearly, in its more important parts, only a repetition of many statements made to the Legation during the Ethiopian dispute, that it has been possible to cut down to a page or so the summary which I attach to the present despatch. 2. In reply, I said that Sheikh Yusuf must not expect a detailed answer. I was* new to the post, and I had not been warned what he proposed to talk about. (I might have reminded him that when he asked for a meeting I had enquired whether he wished to speak of anything of great importance, so that I might be prepared, and that he had waved this aside.) As to Palestine, I was happy to say that, when I was received by Mr. Eden after my appoint ment, he authorised me to convey to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz his personal thanks for the help offered in connexion with the Palestine dispute. On all other points except one my remarks were purely conventional. The exception was Italy, though even on this point I confined myself to genera lities. I said that it was clearly impossible for me to go beyond statements made to the Saudi Government by Sir Andrew Ryan, acting on instructions from His Majesty’s Government. For myself, I would suggest that the Saudi Government should take a long view and not think only of the Ethiopian question, which had been complicated by the fact that the whole world w r as trying to find a solution by hitherto untried methods. The Saudi attitude towards the Italian offer of money and arms was presumably prompted by a desire to maintain their independence, an aim which must have the fullest sympathy of His Majesty’s Government. His Majesty would do well to look again at the Rome understanding of 1927. It was not usual to give such assurances as the Saudi Arab Government had wished to receive. What would happen would depend on world affairs, on a host of circumstances. The King had at least one solid fact to go upon—the long experience of His Majes ty’s Government to w^hieh Sheikh Yousuf had referred with appreciation. I stated that what Sheikh Yusuf had said would be reported to the Foreign Office, and I concluded with suitable thanks for the assurances of friendship, and with similar assurances on our own part. 3. Since the meeting which I have described, I have read with great attention all the papers relating to the attempt made by Ibn Saud a few months ago to obtain from His Majesty’s Government assurances that they would assist him if he should be threatened by the Italians. It is difficult to see what Ibn Saud expects to gain by raising this point again, when it has keen dealt with so fully and so many times by my predecessor, acting on instructions from His Majesty’s Government. But I did not gather that Ibn Saud w as really expecting a more favourable reply, but only that he was stat ing his position. Perhaps he felt that it was the proper thing to do, on the appointment of a new British Minister, to give a summary of his foreign policy as it affects His Majesty’s Government. And then the oriental always attaches importance to individuals, and hopes that B will get him better terms than were offered by B’s predecessor, A. 4. I imagine that you will wish me to express my thanks for the assurances of friendship, and perhaps your particular pleasure, at Ibn Saud’s remember ing occasions before the w r ar when the support of His Majesty’s Government was of assistance to him, and to say, with regard to the references made by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to Italy, that Sir Andrew Ryan went into this question so fully and explained so clearly the attitude of His Majesty’s Government that I am unable to add anything to what he said.

Brief Summary of a Statement made by Sheikh YusUf Yasin to His Majesty''s Minister on October 5, 1936. FRIENDSHIP with His Majesty’s Government had long been the basis of Ibn Saud’s foreign policy. He had been in relations with them since the early days of his career and was grateful for their support. In particular, he was grateful for the help they gave him at a moment when the Turks were about to attack him. They asked the Turks to give them a few months’ notice before the beginning of hostilities, so that British subjects and their property might be removed from Nejd, and, in the interval, he was able to come to terms with the Turks. Ibn Saud now saw danger in three quarters : near, farther off, and remote, viz., Italy, Turkey and Germany. (N.B.—Germany was not mentioned again.) The Italians had been the last to recognise Saudi Arabia, and their conduct in regard to Asir and the Yemen had been very suspicious, but at the time of the Ethiopian dispute there had been a complete revolu tion in their policy towards Saudi-Arabia. Italy had recently wished to give Ibn Saud arms and munitions to the value of perhaps £1 million. He had not wanted to accept, but, to avoid giving offence, he had accepted a few aeroplanes. He had informed Sir Andrew Ryan, and had asked whether His Majesty’s Government could give him assurances. He regretted that they had not been able to do more than refer him to the Rome understanding of 1927. The Turks were ancient enemies of the Arabs, and resented the rise to Independence and importance of people whom they regarded as savages. It was fear of the Turks that had impelled him to initiate the^negotiations that had ended with the treaty with Iraq. (Here Sheikh Yusuf Yasin made a brief but very cordial reference to Iraq.) Difficulties with Transjordan arose from time to time (Sheikh Yusuf hinted that these were due to the incurable levity of character of the Amir Abdullah) but Ibn Saud did not want trouble there. He had always been conciliatory, and he trusted that with the help of His Majesty’s Government such difficulties as arose would always be settled satisfactorily. As to Syria, Ibn Saud had made a point of keeping on good terms with the French. In regard to Palestine, Ibn Saud had no other aim than to see peace re-estab lished between two parties, both of whom were his friends. The statement ended with conventional but strong assurances of friend ship. 3 read with great r Ibn Saud a few urances that they It is difficult to ^ain, when it has cess or, acting on ot gather that Ibn t that he w^as stat ing to do, on the iry of his foreign he oriental always LI get him better for the assurances Saud’s remember- &gt;sty’s Government eferences made by into this question sty’s Government your instructions* * * (9) (Received on 30th January 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 2, dated 14th January 1937.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. E.-8002-7186-25, dated 5th January 1937. Letter from British Legation, Jedda, to the Right Hon’ble Anthony Eden, No. 315, dated 7th December 1936. Colonel Etherton and Lt.-Col. Micklem, about whom I had the honour to receive your instructions conveyed in Foreign Office telegram No. 129, dated 19th November, left yesterday for the Sudan, whence they proposed to return to London by air. They have not secured the mining concession which was the object of their journey. From other sources I gather that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate Ltd. succeeded in preventing the grant of the concession to Selection Trust Ltd., though it does not appear that the Syndicate have obtained it for themselves. Lt. Col. Mick- lem speaks of the last Saudi offer as being still open, but professes to be dis illusioned as to the value of the concession and to hope that his Board will not close with the offer. One of his objections is that the area concernedbegins over two hundred miles from the Red Sea Coast and that transport difficulties would therefore be very great. The area is apparently the one which lies just beyond the Syndicate’s eastern boundary and which is coveted by the Syndicate as a valuable supplement to the concession they already hold. 2. The negotiators seem to have found the Saudi authorities lukewarm, presumably because of the other bidders. There was no official of standing within reach, and they had to negotiate through the Director of Public Works in Jedda, Najib Salha, who only a few years ago was a clerk in the employ of Messrs. Gellatly Hankey here. Towards the end of their stay, however, they at least had the satisfaction of a long interview with Fuad Bey, who had by then returned from abroad and from his subsequent visit to Mecca. 3. As your telegram did not reach me until the afternoon of November 20th and Colonel Etherton was due the next day, I assumed that he was arriv ing by aeroplane in any case and that what was required was merely a noti fication to the local authorities. The notification was given, but Colonel Etherton had been trying in Cairo to get permission from the Saudi Govern ment for the aeroplane to land in Jedda, and failing to get permission he and his companion flew to Port Sudan and crossed by steamer, arriving at Jedda several days later than if they had travelled from Egypt by sea. Colonel Etherton also failed, in spite of an appeal he made to Fuad Bey, to get per mission for the aeroplane to come to Jedda to fetch him and Col. Micklem and, they crossed to the Sudan and proceeded by air from there. I knew of their difficulty in this matter, but believing that if a company which was a possible source of income to Ibn Saud could not by its own efforts obtain permission for an aeroplane to land here, support from the Legation would almost certainly be ineffective and that in any case, since the Saudi authorities are not likely bo make this privilege general, intervention on this occasion might be a cause of embarrassment if similar applications should be received in future. The question however calls for examination, and I am studying it. 4. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade, ( 10 ) {Received on 8th February 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 3 dated 21st January 1937.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 12th January 1937. Letter from British Legation, Jedda, to the Right Hon’ble Anthony Eden, No. 314, dated 6th December 1936. With reference to Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 156 (1447/132/14) dated 26th May 1933, regarding the distribution of wireless stations in Saudi Arabia, and to subsequent despatches on the same subject ending with Mr, Calvert’s No. 210 (1734/157/9), dated 22nd July 1933, I have the honour to inform you that according to a report published in the “ Saut al Hejaz ” on November 17th, two new wireless stations which are entirely unaffected by atmospherics have been erected at Riyadh and Abha. The report adds that the Saudi Government are endeavouring to obtain a number of other sets of this type for erection in various places. 2. The only other information on this point that I have been able to obtain has been furnished by representative of the firm of Sharqieh Ltd. who state that Messrs. Marconi did not supply these new sets. They also gave a piece of information which was new to the Legation, viz., that a German interested in wireless installation visited Jedda last spring and is believed to have disposed of at least one set here—a set mainly designed for reception but able to transmit up to short distances useful for local purposes.9 # 17 3. From the 1933 despatch quoted above it will be seen that whereas Abha had only an old Telefunken set, there was at Riyadh a new Marconi station of six kilowatts. 4. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade, Baghdad, Bushire and Jerusalem. (H) {Received on 8th February 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. J, dated 21st January 1937.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 18th January 1937. Letter from the Residency, Cairo, to the Right Hon ble Anthony Eden, No. 1385, dated 18th December 1936. Since my despatch No. 1383 of December 17th was written, I have re ceived your despatch No. 1155 (E 7344/2617/91) enclosing a record of a con versation between the Saudi Minister in London and Mr. Rendel on November , 23rd. 2. I have read this report with especial interest seeing that it very much bears out the train of ideas elaborated in my despatch under reference. The information in King Tbn Saud’s possession clearly confirms what we have heard from other independent sources, namely an intensification of Italian ^ intrigue in the Yemen. 3. I have never disguised the extreme gravity with which I view the situa tion that is apparently now developing. At great pains we have been elabo rating with Egypt arrangements for the safeguarding of the Suez Canal as an essential link in our Imperial Communications. I trust I am in error in fearing that those communications risk being blocked by Italy at the other (southern) end of the Red Sea. 4. Viewed from that angle, the present overture of King Ibn Saud through his Minister as recorded in Mr. Renders note strikes me as being of the highest potential importance : and I most earnestly trust that it be not lightly turned down or ignored. Ibn Saud, who is a particularly powerful character and the dominant factor in Arab politics to-day, is doubtless acting mainly through motives of self-interest: so indeed are we. But it seems to me clear from what the Saudi Minister said that Ibn Saud fears that the Italians, having gained the domination—if not indeed the annexation—of the Yemen will next turn their attention to the neighbouring Hedjaz and other contiguous ^ Saudi territory. Clearly it is one thing to have the Imam as a neighbour : s it is quite another to have the Italians. 5. I have long felt convinced that we are approaching the parting of the ways with Italy, who, having annexed Abyssinia was certain sooner or later—and probably sooner than later—to try and do the same thing across the Red Sea in the Yemen. I am more convinced than ever that that is her aim and ambition. If I am correct—and I believe I am—there seems to me only two alternatives : (a) some arrangement with Italy that will de finitely check her expansion at the Southern end of the Red Sea and prevent this threat to our interests ; (b) a trial of strength with Great Britain to ensure that such expansion does not take place. 6. I am well aware of the present conversations between London and Rome with a view to a “ detente ” in our relations. And I trust I may not be considered out of order or an alarmist if, nonetheless, I formally record my doubt whether any understanding with Italy in her present mood of cocksureness is going to achieve what w 7 e want, or put an end to the growing threat to the safety of our communications at the Southern end of the Red Sea, coupled with the safety of Perim and our possession of Aden. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda&gt; to the Chief Commissioner and Resident and Commander-in-Chief, Aden, and to the Governor-General of the Sudan. 65(0 ExAffairsDept18 ( 12 ) {Received on 8th February 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 3, dated 21st January, 1937.)

Although the now famous Maffey Report found there was little to fear from an occupation of Abyssinia by Italy, the view of Europeans, Arabs and Somalis in the Red Sea area appears to be that the conflict between Italy and Great Britain is all but certain to break out within the next few years. They only differ on the subject of time : when it will become impossi ble for Great Britain to acquiesce further in their lines of communications to Egypt and the Eastern Mediterranean and their territories in Africa and Arabia being threatened by the Black Army of Italy. In 1935 Italy pre pared for a war against the Abyssinians, they say ; in 1939 or 1940 she will prepare for a war against British territories, possibly when Britain is already engaged in the Far East or in Europe. 18. Points of interest which arose in conversations may be summarised as follows :— (a) Although the King of the Yemen is anti-Italian, he is old, His Prime Minister is strongly pro-Italian and the King’s son is being educated at Asmara by the Italians. (b) A great deal of pro-Italian propaganda is going on in the Yemen and considerable sums of money are being spent by the Italians in this territory. (c) Tw t o Battalions of Yemen troops have been formed as part of the Italian Army of Abyssinia. (d) A number of Somali Battalions are also being formed. Recruits are being paid 300 lira a month. It is reported that this pay is attracting even British Somali seamen : out of 45 told recently to report only 2 came forward. (e) Imports into Abyssinia are being confined to Italian products and manufactures. British goods are being refused entry. The economic position of Italy and her Colonies makes such action necessary. (f) The Italian troops are discontented and the majority are to be repatriated. The future Italian Army in Abyssinia is to con sist of 40,000 Italian and 160,000 black troops. With this Army it is not thought that Italy will find it difficult to sub jugate the country. Their ‘ frightfulness ’ against the black population is likely, as in Libya, to have the desired effect. (g) Great ^Britain has ‘ lost face ’ greatly in the whole native area of North East Africa and Arabia. The people are not interested in what is said, but in what happens, and Italy has seized Abyssinia despite the opposition of Great Britain. 19. The view appears to be held generally that Great Britain is only too prone to believe the unfriendly actions and statements of a foreign power to be bluff. 1 hat the policy of Italy in the Red Sea is definitely aimed at damaging the strategic position of Great Britain. That in a w T ar wdth Italyit would be a struggle for lines of communication, and that should the de fences of Aden, and the forces stationed there during the recent emergency represent the strength we considered adequate to safeguard our lines of com munication, then there was a great surprise in store lor us. The present state of the defences of Aden—* * * * *—virtually invite attack. The six 3-inch H. A. guns would have been little if any deterrent, and the air forces, owing to their lack of speed and endurance, could only have been used for night bombing of the nearest objectives. * * * * (13) {Received on 20th February 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 5, dated 4th February 1937.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 29th January 1937. Letter from the British Legation, Jedda, to the Right Hon’ele An thony Eden, No. 330, dated 29th December 1936. I had the honour to receive your views on Mr. Philby’s entry into the Aden Protectorate, in your telegram No. 135, dated December 5th. I should have preferred to dispose of the matter by another conversation with Fuad Bey, but by then he had left for Riyadh for a stay which might extend to seve ral weeks, and I therefore wrote to the Amir Feysal the letter [S. No. (6)] of which a copy was sent to you under No. 319 on December 8th. The reply of December 21st, which was forwarded in translation under No. 329 of De cember 22nd, was not satisfactory. The Saudi authorities continued to de fend themselves, which was not necessary, as their disclaimer had been accept ed. On the other hand they put forward what was obviously a defence supplied by Mr. Philby, including the irrelevance about the vagueness of the frontier and the impertinence about his readiness to show his British passport had there been any frontier authorities to show r it to. And they assumed, as the King of the Yemen assumed when complaining of a similar incursion by Mr. Philby into the Yemen (this was reported to the Colonial Office in Aden despatch No. 544, dated November 7th) that as a British subject Mr. Philby ought to be punished by His Majesty’s Government if he had com mitted any offence against the laws and regulations of the Aden Protectorate. I was about to reply to this letter when Fuad Bey returned to Jedda and I was able to speak to him again on the subject. 2. I told Fuad Bey that I assumed he had had a hand in the Saudi reply since he had been at Riyadh during the time when my letter w as aw aiting an answer. The reply ignored an essential point which I had brought out clearly in my first talk with him on the subject, viz., the unannounced arrival at Shabwa with the Saudi “ escort ”. It w as true that when one of his cars broke dowm Mr. Philby had had to go into the Hadhramaut for spares : the Aden authorities admitted that; but this admission did not cover Shabwa, w'hich no necessity compelled him to visit without informing the authorities beforehand of his desire to do so. Here Fuad asked wdth what appeared to be real surprise whether Shabwa w r as not in the Hadhramant. I suspect that what had happened was this. When Fuad was called upon to concoct a defence to my letter he got out his copy of the map on which I had shown him Shabwa (Geographical Section of the General Staff No. 3891, 1930, with corrections to 1935), and also the apologia which Mr. Phitby must have sent to Ibn Saud. From the lettering on the map Shabw r a might be in the Hadh ramaut, and Mr. Philby will doubtless have reported that the Aden authorities found it not unreasonable that he should have entered the Hadhramaut for spares and supplies : hence the wdiole incident had been condoned by Aden. I disposed of this by saying that Shabwa, though a long way inside the Aden Protectorate, is not in the Hadhramaut and that it was not a need for stores, and spares that drove Mr. Philby to visit Shabwa, which w r as obviously his goal from the beginning. Here I reminded Fuad Bey of the incursion into the Yemen, but he replied that possibly the Imam only imagined that the places visited by Mr. Philby formed part of Jof and Marib. 1 did not pur sue this side issue.3. Throughout the conversation I tried to do two things : to distinguish clearly between the innocence of the Saudi Government and the responsibility of Mr. Philby, and to speak of Mr. Philby’s action with what seems to me the proper mixture of seriousness and ridicule. I told Fuad Bey that Mr. Philby was an old colleague and acquaintance of mine. Everyone knew that he enjoyed being obstinate and tiresome, particularly when His Majesty’s Government were concerned—a quality of which there was clear evidence in the Saudi reply to my letter, as in the nonsense about his readiness to show his British passport (Fuad Bey laughed at this and did not deny that the ar gument was Philby’s). It was not a question of our punishing him for an offence but of our making it clear to the Saudi Government that his action might have brought them under the suspicion of committing a serious diplo matic impropriety. He had obtained an armed “ escort ” from the Saudi authorities for the purpose of topographical work in Najran. The results of this work would be interesting to him as an explorer, but they would also be of great use to the Saudi Government, and Mr. Philby was in a way acting as their employee. (Fuad Bey did not object to this statement, but on the contrary nodded assent.) In any case, I went on, the “ escort ” was provided for tliis specific purpose, but Mr. Philby, carefully concealing his intention both from the Saudi Government and from the British autho rities, used it for a quite different purpose, viz., to enter the Aden Protectorate two hundred miles away. In fact, Mr. Philby had played a nasty trick upon the Saudi authorities and we expected them to make this quite clear to him. 4. Fuad Bey took no exception to anything in my statement, which I said I mu&lt;t follow up with a letter ( a copy of this letter is enclosed) to make the point about Shabwa quite clear. He did not say that any action would be taken, but Ibn Saud will not be pleased at the dust which Mr. Philby has raised at this moment, when he is on his best behaviour towards His Majesty’s Government. If he had an inkling beforehand of what was in Mr. Philby’s mind he cannot have reaslied what it would involve. On the other hand as an oriental he cannot feel called upon to be very harsh with a man who is a British subject and in receipt of a pension from British sources and whom, in his opinion, we could punish ourselves if we wished. More over he cannot fail to be flattered if Mr. Philby tells him, as he doubtless will, that Ibn Baud’s name and “ escort ” were sufficient to ensure safe entry into a town which it is difficult to enter from the direction of the territory of which the British claim that it forms part. But Ibn Saud has now no doubt about our attitude in regard to the Aden boundary, and he will not lightly let Mr. Philby loose with an “ escort ” again. I felt that the best line to take was that Mr. Philby had abused the confidence placed in him by Ibn Saud. This argument might even appeal to Mr Philby himself, who seems to have a sense of loyalty towards Ibn Saud such as he does not feel towards His Majesty’s Government; but that would involve an admission that he was in the wrong, and Mr. Philby is never in the wrong. 5. I will not fail to carry out your instructions to report any explanation which Mr. Philby may give. I foresee that he will dramatise himself as a Prometheus, bringing the fire of archaeological knowledge from Shabwa with His Majesty’s Government in the part of Zeus, and H. M. Minister as the vulture with no other business in life but to peck at Mr. Philby’s long- suffering liver, already deeply pitted from similar heroic experiences in India and Iraq and Trans-Jordan. 6. Copies of this despatch and enclosure are being sent to H. M. Chief Commissioner at Aden. Enclosure 1 to S. No. (13). Personal letter from the British Legation, Jedda, to His Royal Highness the Amir Feysal, Mecca, No. 2211/316/62, dated 29th December 1936. Since I had the honour to receive Your Royal Highness’s personal letter about Mr. Philby’s journey, No. 2/9/6, dated 21st December, I have hadthe opportunity to see His Excellency Fuad Bey and to speak of the matter again. It is true that when one of Mr. Philby’s cars broke down the Aden autho rities did not object to his going into the Hadhramaut to obtain spares, but no such need drove Mr. Philby to visit Shabwa, which is incontestably in the Aden Protectorate though not in the Hadhramaut and it .was in parti cular on the question of Shabwa that I based the earlier conversation which I had with His Excellency Fuad Bey. No suspicion can attach to the Govern ment of H. M. King Abdul Aziz in this matter in view of the assurances which they have given, but Your Royal Highness will permit me to say that it is for His Majesty’s Government to judge how the arrival of Mr. Philby with an armed Saudi force (or escort) might be viewed by persons living in the Aden Protectorate. But I do not wish to prolong this question any further, and I conclude by stressing the comment which I made to His Excellency Fuad Bey on December 26th as to the great impropriety committed by Mr. Philby in procuring an armed force (or escort) from the Saudi Government for topo graphical work in Najran and using it, without their knowledge, for a quite different and an illegitimate purpose, viz., to enter the territory of the Aden Protectorate. (14) (Received on 20th February 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 5, dated 4th February 1937.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 27th January 1937. Letter from Foreign Office, London, to Sir Miles Lampson, Cairo, No. 81, dated 25th January 1937. I have read with interest Your Excellency’s Secret despatch No. 1385 (820/4/36) of the 18th December [S. No. (11)], regarding the question of Italian activities in the Yemen. I am fully alive to the most disquieting features of the situation discussed in your despatch and the question of the policy of His Majesty’s Government in this matter is forming the subject of consi deration in the Middle East Official Sub-Committee of the Committee of Im perial Defence. 2. In the meantime, while I do not wish to minimise the dangers of the position, there are certain considerations which suggest that the Italian Gov ernment may not be so firmly determined on a policy of intensive penetration in the Yemen as has sometimes been suggested. I shall welcome an early expression of your views on the following considerations. 3. In the first place, as you are aware, the Italian Government have vir tually undertaken in the Rome understanding with His Majesty’s Govern ment of 1927 not to establish themselves at any point on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. I realise that it would be unwdse to place too much reliance on such an undertaking on the part of the Italian Government but it should be noted that it is accompanied by a corresponding virtual undertaking on the part of His Majesty’s Government that they also wdll not establish them selves on any point of the Arabian coast of the Red Sea; and that the Italian Government have in the past shown that they attach great importance to this undertaking to wffiich they have frequently appealed. The view has more than once been expressed that one of the many motives inspiring Italian policy to-day is a fear that His Majesty’s Government may themselves be aim ing at some extension of their territorial or political influence in Arabia. Such a fear is unfounded, but to the Italian mind it may appear to possess some reality, and it cannot, therefore, be entirely excluded in considering Ita lian policy in this area. The Italians no doubt realise that if they were to violate the Rome understanding of 1927 they would thereby free His Majesty’s * Government from any obligation under that understanding. They wuuld thus enable His Majesty’s Government to occupy any area they desired in the Yemen 56(C) ExAffairsDept22 such as, for example, Sheikh Said or the hinterland in the neighbourhood of the Aden Protectorate frontier near Taiz (where indeed British control might be welcomed). Moreover, they would justify His Majesty’s Govern ment in entering into closer and more intimate relations with King Ibn Saud. 4. No doubt Italian local authorities in Africa and officers of the Italian Army, Navy and Air Force—looking at this question from the purely military, naval or air point of view—are anxious to secure for themselves a position of predominant influence in the Yemen. But in view of the considerations urged above it is questionable whether the Italian Government in Rome, who are fully aware of the magnitude of their task in Abyssinia and of the risks involved in any new adventure in Arabia, are as eager as the Italian fighting services to pursue a definitely aggressive policy on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. 5. The above considerations are not conclusive, but they deserve to b e taken into account in any appreciation of the situation. In addition to you r observations on them, I desire to learn your views on the whole question of Italian activities in Arabia in the light of such bearing as, in your opinion, the conclusion of the Anglo-Egyptian alliance has upon it. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador in Rome and to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda.

Personal letter from Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mecca, dated 21st December 1936. With reference to Your Excellency’s personal letter No. 2102/316/55 of December 8th, 1936, I have the honour to inform you that I am glad to learn that the British Government were pleased with the assurance given by the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the (nature of the) de parture from Najran by Mr. Philby. The information given to you by the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs explains the attitude of the Govern ment of H. M. the King on this question. It has been a cause of regret to the Government of H. M. the King that the matter should have left any consequences (literally. “ tails ”) and that an importance which it does not in fact possess should be attributed to it. Your Excellency may be assured that, in. remote, deserts it is very difficult to distinguish the actual frontiers if they are not fixed and known, just as it is difficult to comply with the special arrangements concerning the crossing of the frontiers particularly when there are no special officials for such purpose. Moreover, as the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs has already explained to you, the Government of H. M. the King had no knowledge of the intention of Mr. Philby to go to the Hadhramaut. It was therefore impossible for the necessary application to be made for per mission for him to go there. I have moreover learnt that when Mr. Philby was asked by the responsible authorities in the Hadhramaut why he had gone there in such manner he replied that he held a British passport and that he was prepared to produce it to the frontier officials had there been any. I have also learnt that Mr. Philby has explained to the responsible authorities in the Hadhramaut the reasons for his going there and that he was not entrusted with any mission by the Government of H. M. the King and that he only went into the Hadhramaut because he had to get his cars repaired and to obtain some articles which he needed. It appears that they were satisfied with his explanations and afforded him the required assistance. Had it not been so, it would have been their concern, and within their power to take the measures they thought proper against him.23 In any case I think the importance attached to the journey of Mr. Philby and the impression it caused or might have caused have been much exaggera ted especially if we take into consideration the fact that his journey was not made by order of the Government nor with their permission. As to the armed persons said to have accompanied Mr. Philby, they were merely such guides, guards and servants as escort every one who travels in the desert to protect and assist the traveller and to supply him with his requirements. Consequently I hope that the explanation which I have given will serve to remove suspicion (literally “ what has come into the minds ”) and to assure of the good intentions of the Government of H. M. the King. ( 16 ) {Received on 13th March 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 8, dated 25th February 1937.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 22nd February 1937.

Letter from Minister, Jedda, to Foreign Office, No. 327, dated 11th January 1937. Jedda, December 21,1936. The operations of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited) in this country ha^ e, it is believed, progressed steadily since the last reports on the subject were rendered by Mr. Calvert in his despatches No. 225 and No. 267 of the 28th July and the 12th September respectively. Little has been heard of the developments in the operations at Wejh, and as regards the progress at the Maod-ad-Dhahab, information has not so far indicated that any &amp; suc- cessful outcome to their operations is yet in sight. It is understood, however, that a water supply, inadequate for all the purposes of the mine, but never theless in a useful quantity, has been discovered, but it would appear that the syndicate are still sanguine of the ultimate success of their operations from their activity in completing their “ terminal ” headquarters at Jedda, which are expected to be ready for occupation by the end of Feburary next, and in pushing forward the work on the projected jetty, to which a reference was made in paragraph 371 of Jedda report for November last. _ Twitched has, during the past few weeks, been otherwise engaged than in directing the present operations of the syndicate, for, according to a reliable report, he has recently visited Riyadh, accompanied by one of his principal geologists Mr. Darken, and by Mr. C. L. W. Bindloss, the engineer in charge of the syndicate s transport organisation. At Riyadh Mr. Twitched, who. is expected to return to Jedda shortly, is stated to have been negotiating25 an extension of the area of the Saudi-Arabian Mining Syndicate’s present concession. It may be presumed that the new area is that for which Colonel Etherton and Colonel Micklem unsuccessfully sought a mining concession last month (see my despatch No. 315 of the 7th December), an area in which may lie the legendary Najadeh gold mine, of which mention has been made in pre vious reports, and the promising Jebel Hilit district, which lies just outside the limits of the present concessionary area of the syndicate. My informant said that, as part of the price of a new concession, Mr. Twitched was prepared to offer to build a first-class motor road from Riyadh to the Hejaz for which undertaking the syndicate already have the necessary road making machinery in the country. 3. It is now possible to confirm that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate made a loan, of an unknown amount, to the Saudi Arab Government during the summer of 1936, as reported in Jedda despatch No. 268 of the 12th Sep tember last. A member of the syndicate’s staff recently stated that the Saudi Arab Government were finding it difficult to fulfil the condition to liquidate this loan in monthly payments. 4. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade and Transjordan. ( 18 ) {Received on 6th March 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 7, dated ISth February 1937.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 16th February 1937. Letter from Foreign Office, London, to Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, No. E. 7835/2617/91, dated 15th February 1937. With reference to Conclusion (e) of the 48th meeting of the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, held on the 14th December 1936, by which the Colonial Office and the Foreign Office are invited to pursue the question of British Consular representation in the Yemen, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to state that, as the result of a careful examination of this proposal in the Foreign Office, a number of serious objections have become apparent. 2. In the first place, were the King of t he Yemen to admit British Consular representation he would not be able to refuse the same treatment to the Italian Government. It seems more than probable that the result would be a race in which each Government would strive to outstrip the other in the size and influence of its Consular establishments, and that His Majesty’s Government would either have to meet the expense involved in maintaining a more im posing establishment than the Italian Government or stand by and see the Italian Government acquire precisely that position which it is desired to pre vent them from acquiring. 3. But in any case the recent refusal of the Imam as reported by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad in his despatch No. 616 of the 31st December last (a copy of which was sent to you in the Foreign Office letter E-362/34/93 of the 4th February), to consent to the establishment of an Iraqi Diplomatic Mission either at Hodeida or Sanaa suggests that it is most unlikely that he would agree to the establishment in his country of British Consular offices. Even if he were to give his consent, it would probably be long before a Consul, on whose doings a fierce light would from the start be directed, could live down the suspicion with which he would be regarded and evolve an alternative system of intelligence and reporting of equal efficiency to that by means of which the Residency at Aden at present obtains information regarding events in the Yemen. 4. In the second place the establishment of Consular representation in the Yemen presents difficulties from an administrative point of view, since the climate and living conditions are such that special conditions of service ' 55(C) ExAffairaDept. Iwould be necessary, while the fact that frequent changes of officers would be inevitable would be liekly to detract from the satisfactory performance of the difficult duties which the officers would have to carry out if the post were to have any value at all. 5. In view of thq foregoing considerations Lord Halifax considers that it would, in present circumstances, be preferable not to pursue the suggestion further and would be glad to learn whether Mr. Ormsby Gore is in agreement with this view. 6. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, India Office and Treasury. (19) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 27th February 1937. Letter FRom Foreign Office, London, to the Right Hon’ble Sir Emr Drummond, Rome, No. 182, dated 24th February 1937. C The Counsellor of the Italian Embassy called here on the 3rd February in order to discuss Anglo-Italian relations in the Red Sea area. He said that the Italian Government had been rendered uneasy at the recent journeys of Captain Seager (the British frontier officer on the Aden-Yemeni frontier! from Aden to Sana’a, and of Mr. Philby to the Hadhramaut. Signor Crolla seemed rather confused about these journeys and at times spoke of Mr Philbv’s jouraeys to the coast of the Persian Gulf where, as was explained to him Mr. Philby had not been for many years. But it appeared that the reference to these journeys was merely intended to introduce the subject, and that the real object of his visit was to say that Italy relied entirely on and held firmlv to the Borne understanding of 1927, and to express the hope that His Majesty's Government themselves were prepared to continue equally to base themselves on that instrument. M • 2 ; ^ lg p° r Crolla y as in reply that it must be self-evident that His Majesty s Government could have no ambitions in the Arabian peninsula and and no wish to increase their responsibilities by adopting any kind of forward po icy beyond the areas already under their sovereignty or protection Thdr policy, as the Italian Government must know, was the maintenance of the status quo* 3. As regards the journeys to which Signor Crolla had particularly alluded Captain Seager was, as the Italian Government were aware, the Brftish fron tier officer on the Aden-Yemeni frontier. His Majesty’s Government had no representatives in the Yemen, but the fact that they had a common frontW with that country naturally led to the necessity for discussing various frontier questions of common interest. In the circumstances it seemed entirdv natural that Captain Seager should go to Sana’a from time to time 'n the le j p i»« sally believed abroad that be was a British agentfbot it mist be'sufficieidv obvious that such activities as his recent incursion into the Aden Protectorate were hard !&gt;_ th( ^® a British agent. Signor Crolla was then given a brief account of Mr. Philby s career, and told that the Italian Government should not be misled by the ridiculous reports to which Mr. Philby’s adventures ine\ ita dy gave rise. He eventually said that the Italian Government were under no misapprehension on this point and did not take Mr. Philby seriouslv conversation^^ 111 ' h0WeVer ’ w,l - v he had referred to him at the outset of the to extend their responsibilities in Arabia the nndH™ „ „ l attempting b. d,m,d th.t there had b,„ » d,., ot , 0Me «and naval circles about the obvious strategic advantages which Italy might obtain if she secured a foothold in the Yemen. It was no doubt unnecessary to attach excessive importance to such remarks, but this kind of talk had unquestionably created a great deal of uneasiness in certain quarters. 5. Signor Crolla said that any such uneasiness was entirely unjustified. Italy had her hands more than full in Abyssinia, and the last thing she wanted was an Arabian adventure. In any case, her policy was to adhere firmly to the undertakings of the Rome understanding of 1927, and he wished to give a formal and categorical assurance to this effect. The Italian Government for their part had, he repeated, certainly felt some uneasiness at Captain Seager’s journey. There had been reports to the effect that he had discussed with the Imam the possible cession or lease of certain points on the Red Sea Coast. These rumours, though they were unconfirmed, had given rise to much sus picion as to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government. Signor Crolla was told that these stories were entirely ridiculous. It was just as much to the interest of His Majesty’s Government as to that of Italy to adhere strictly to the undertakings contained in the Rome understanding. The last thing which His Majesty’s Government could have contemplated was to have attempted, in violation of those undertakings, to obtain any cession or lease of this sort from the Imam, even if there had been any prospect of the Imam considering such suggestions. In any case, Signor Crolla could regard what was being said to him as a formal assurance that nothing of the sort had ever been contemplated, and that such action would be entirely contrary to the basic principles of the policy of His Majesty’s Government in Arabia, which were the strict maintenance of the independence and integrity of the two Arabian States, that is to say of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. Signor Crolla, after expressing appreciation of this assurance, said that he felt that the detente in Anglo-Italian relations ought to be extended to the middle East as well, and that he would like to see the Rome understanding of 1927 developed. He was given no encouragement to pursue this line, but he went on to explain that the Italian Government attached importance to the observance of the provisions in the Rome understanding for Anglo-Italian consultation. 6.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 14th April 1937. Letter from Minister, Jedda, to Foreign Office, No. 27, dated 22nd March 1937. Jedda, February 28, 1937. In accordance with the instructions conveyed in the last paragraph of your telegram No. 135, dated the 5th December, regarding Mr. Philby’s expedition into the Aden Protectorate, I had the honour to send you, in my telegram No. 9 of the 22nd February, an outline of Mr. Philby’s attitude. I now transmit a full summary of statements which he made to me in the course of a conversation on the 18th February. The collapse of his motor transport and, later, heavy floods delayed his return so long that he had only a tew hours in Jedda before leaving for Mecca for the pilgrimage, but during that short time he called at the Legation and he talked freely about his journey. 2. As I anticipated, Mr. Philby was in his most heroic prometheus mood. Indeed, he was even more difficult than I had expected, for to his desire to bring the light of science to mankind is now added a quite ferocious intention to expose the alleged duplicity of His Majesty’s Government towards the Arabs of the peninsula. He asserts that the second part of this programme was added only under the provocation which he considers he received from the Aden authorities. I did not enter upon a discussion of the pledges given or alleged to have been given in respect of Arab independence. I had never studied the McMahon correspondence closely from the point of view of the Arabian peninsula, and, in any case, it would be unwise to treat Mr. Philby as the protagonist of the Arab claims. Moreover, I had in hand the less ne bulous argument that Shabwa lay outside the extreme limits ever claimed by the Saudi Government. Mr. Philby’s attitude towards that fact is shown in paragraph 6 of the enclosed record. He professes to demand independence for the Arabs in the Arabian peninsula without regard to the Saudi demands, of which he, however, claimed to be fully aware. He informed me that he had on his maps the two proposed frontiers in the south, the British and the gaudi. In that case, he was aware before he set out for Shabwa that it lay heyond the limits claimed by the Saudi Government. 3. Mr. Philby is unable to see that he treated Ibn Saud badly in obtain ing an escort for topographical work and exploration in Saudi Arabia and using it, unknown to his patron, to enter territory outside Saudi Arabia. As to the Aden authorities, he regards their claim to Shabwa as a trespass on territory which was abandoned by His Majesty’s Government in favour of Arab independence in the McMahon correspondence. In that corres pondence His Majesty’s Government agreed to recognise “ the independence of the Arab countries ” within the limits laid down by the Sherif Hussein, which included the whole of the Arabian peninsula except Aden and, possibly, the Arab States on the Persian Gulf, but they added the proviso: “ without prejudice to the existing treaties with Arab Chiefs.” Probably Mr. Philby would say that His Majesty’s Government had no treaty then and have none now with the Arab Chief of Shabwa, and regard that as the last word on a subject of great practical and legal complexity. I assume that the observations of the Chief Commissioner of Aden on Mr. Philby’s claims will be recorded in due course. At first sight it seems to me that there is just enough truth in Mr. Philby’s contention to afford a moral shelter behind which he can indulge his personal tastes and feelings and interests to the full. 4. Mr. Philby’s claim that from the political point of view his expedition was on all fours with that of Mr. Bertram Thomas is unfounded. It is true that Mr. Thomas was at the time in the employ of the Sultan of Muscat, but he had no official escort, and the Sultan had never given reason to anyone * *29 *&gt; © to suppose that he wished to increase his territory. Moreover, the whole of Mr. Thomas’s route lay to the east of the blue line which at the time of the McMahon correspondence represented the legal western boundary of the ter ritories of those Arab Chiefs on the Persian Gulf with whom His Majesty’s Government had treaties. Mr. Philby would probably say that the Turks had no authority to agree to the blue line, which took no account of their defeat at the hands of Ibn Saud, but he does not know that Ibn Saud has recently ad mitted that His Majestj^’s Government saved him from being crushed by the Turks. This admission was made in the message transmitted through Sheikh Yusuf Yasin which I reported in my despatch No. 283, dated the 11th October. But in any case, Mr. Philby could not be expected to forgo an opportunity to use Mr. Thomas as a stick with which to beat His Majesty’s Government. 5. The statements recorded in paragraph 5 of the enclosure left little doubt in my mind that Mr. Philby did enter the territory of the King of the Yemen, and since he cannot accuse the King of encroaching on Arab territory, he will have to find another excuse for the encroachment which the King rightly resented. But he will probably think the purity of his intentions sufficient excuse. 6. Mr. Philby does not seem to have entered the band of territory lying between the proposed British and Saudi fines, but he may have gathered some information about it. In recent discussions with Fuad Bey I have claimed it for Aden and Oman on the ground that the four wells in it which are shown on our maps, viz., Sanau and Thamut in the Hadhramaut hinterland and Shisur and Tadhau in the hinterland of Oman, are not on Fuad Bey’s list of Murra wells, have never been claimed by the Saudi Government by name, and, ac cording to the information in Thomas’s Arabia Felix, fie to the south of the Rub-al-Khali and in the steppe country which rises from the rim of the desert to the crests of the coastal range and are frequented almost exclusively by tribes to whom Ibn Saud lays no claim. It is unlikely that Mr. Philby has collected any better information on this point than Bertram Thomas, who passed through the territory in question and halted at Shisur, but he may make it more difficult for Ibn Saud to renounce his claim by representing the tribes thereabouts as entirely beyond the control of the authorities in the coastal States, but ready and willing to submit to Ibn Saud. Ibn Saud is so much more a statesman than Mr. Philby that I am hopeful that nothing Mr. Philby can say will influence him in this matter, the more so as, having repudiated responsibility for the expedition, he can hardly quote the results to his own advantage. I am more anxious lest the appearance of the promised attack on His Majesty’s Government in Mr. Philby’s next book should drag the question of the smaller Arab States in the Arabian peninsula into the vortex of controversy about the McMahon correspondence. 7. I do not propose to engage in a dispute on pan-Arab politics with Mr. Philby, nor to continue the discussion about his visit to Shabwa. The views of His Majesty’s Government have been conveyed to the Saudi Govern ment, and Mr. Philby has also been informed of those views, and the matter had better, I suggest, be left there. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosure to Aden, Cairo Jerusalem, Bagdad and Bushire. Enclosure to letter No. 27, dated the 22nd March 1937. Summary of Statements made by Mr. Philby about his Expedition to Shabwa and beyond, in the course of a Conversation which he had with His Majesty's Minister on February 18, 1937. It was quite true that Ibn Saud had nothing to do with the expedition beyond instructing all local officials to assist him. Mr. Philby had defrayed all the expenses himself (and they had turned out to be much heavier than he had expected), though he had financed himself by drawing on Saudi trea suries, where they existed, and refunding the advances through his firm 65(C) ExAffairsDept.30 in Jedda. The object of to fact, collected a great mass of m a h h ‘/ j oillts . Through- science, and had estabhshed the portion ot over a ^ Saud was that, out the expedition the only eomie^on he ha^haaw^ ^ &amp; Sau(U telegraph as a matter of courtesy, ' • j-enortin^ the date of arrival and the station he sent a telegram to the King reporting me probable date of departure. 9 To show that the journey had originally no concern with politics, he i r that he had written all he had intended to say about the Hadhra- iTSw hS S »S«d, ...'l-'i » .LI.,.4 Mm-, ,„d h= wouhl add Chapters to his forthcoming book which would tell the world the would Protectorate. He was prepared to give His Majesty s Minster all these facts! but he also proposed to give them to the Saudi Gov- ernment. 3 The criticism directed against his visit to Shabwa was entirely un- iustified His journey was on all fours with that of Bertram Thomas across the Rub-al-Khali. He was quite right in claiming that, apart from the Hadhramaut, his journey lay in unexplored, undemarcated territory To daXabwa and those parts for the Aden Protectorate was fantastic, for no protection was afforded. Nor could the Aden authorities claim the virtue of FeS the people thereabouts to manage their own affairs for they bombed item 0 The Aden attitude towards Shabwa was exactly like that of the Italians towards Walwal at the beginning of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, !„d British policy was no more honest than that of Italy had been. The British were trying to expand at the expense of the Arabs. 4 His noliev remained what it had always been, viz., to try to obtain for the Arabs what they were promised early in the Great War. He had chal- l^mred His Majesty’s Government to publish the promises made then (the McMahon correspondence), but with their habitual cowardice they had re- Wrl There were plenty of copies in Arabic to be had, but the English correspondence ought to be published. He would tell His Majesty’s Minister a “ secret ”• he used to possess copies of the correspondence in English, given to him by T. E. Lawrence, but they were stolen from him by a clerk of his in Jedda. 5 He was interested to hear (for the first time) that the King of the Yemen had protested to Ibn Saud, alleging that the expedition had entered Yemen territory at Jauf and Marib. He wondered how the King had heard about it. In point of fact, he had not gone to Marib, but had taken photo- aranhs and bearings from a height from which it was visible. (Mr. Philby evaded, or at least did not answer, the question whether the height in question : „ V/ivwon + fvrr it, nr v. ^ 6. No, it was not quite correct to say that he was asking for more for Ibn Saud than Ibn Saud was asking for himself, though it was near the truth. What he wanted was the establishment of the promised Arab independence in the Arab Peninsula and the elimination of any foreign rule which conflicted with the promises. Mr. Philby claimed to know all about the British and Saudi proposals for the southern frontier of Saudi Arabia and to have the two lines marked on maps in his possession. When His Majesty’s Minister said that in that case he must have known that Shabwa lay well to the south of the proposed Saudi line he said that the position of Shabw^a on the map was a long way out, but he did not deny that Shabw^a was even farther to the south than the map shows, and therefore at a greater distance from the extreme limits claimed by Ibn Saud than appeared from the map.31 ( 22 ) Lettek from the British Embassy, Cairo, to the Bight Hon’ble Anthony Eden, No. 420, dated the 2nd Ajpril 1937. I have read with much interest the record, contained in your despatch No. 182 (E. 784/27/91) of February 24th [S. No. (19)] to Rome, of a discussion at the Foreign Office with the Counsellor of the Italian Embassy on Feb ruary 3rd regarding Anglo-Italian relations in the Red Sea area. 2. I note that according to paragraph 5 of that despatch Signor Crolla was informed that the basic principle of the policy of His Majesty’s Govern ment in Arabia was the strict maintenance of the independence and integrity of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. I have assumed that what was intended was the maintenance of the independence and integrity of these states as against a European power and that the statement made to Signor Crolla was in fact nothing more than a confirmation of Clause 3 of the Rome Under standing of 1927. I raise the point merely for the purpose of elucidation since the sentence in question is capable of the meaning that His Majesty’s Government are prepared to maintain the independence and integrity of the two Arab states in question as against each other—an attitude which would involve a departure from the principle underlying Clause 3 of the Rome Understanding. 3. I am sending a copy of this espatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. Enclosure 1 to S. No. (22).

I have the honour to submit a few remarks on the financial situation of Ibn Saud and its effect upon policy. 2. In the recent monthly reports sent in from this post reference has been made to the determined efforts displayed by the Saudi authorities to collect money otherwise than by taxation, not only from their own subjects, but also from pilgrims. The Aviation Society has published regularly in the press during the last few weeks and appeal to pilgrims urging them to subscribe for the defence of their fatherland, the Holy Land of the Hejaz. Then there is the Piastre Scheme, whose main object seems to be the encourage ment of local industries. The committee in charge of this project have32 A 9 I gone so far as to publish in the Saut-al-Hejaz newspaper an appeal to Moslems written in ill-spelt English, and to advertise small boxes of dates for pilgrims to take home as “ A Present from Medina Other objects for which subs criptions are invited are the sacred well of Zamzam, the Waziriya water scheme for Jedda, the First Aid Society, the Charitable Society, the Asylum for Orphans and the Aged, and so on. The pilgrim guides are required to press these schemes upon the attention of their pilgrims, and for the Aviation Society the guides are under moral compulsion to buy books of 1 riyal tickets proportioned to the number and supposed wealth of their pilgrims, and are left to pass them on to the pilgrims if they can, or to bear the loss themselves. Pilgrims have been subjected to pressure on behalf of these various schemes, but no complaints have been received from British pilgrims. It is accepted that a pilgrim should distribute wdiat he can in charity while he is in the Hejaz, and if there were no societies appealing for his money, it might go to individual beneficiaries or be extorted under various pretexts by the guides. 3. It is easy to deride the thirst for money which underlies these appeals, and the latest Jedda report contrasts the requests for charity with Ibn Saud’s alleged expenditure of over £600 for walnuts and pistachio nuts for his last hunting trip. But it is impossible not to feel some sympathy for him. His personal expenditure is doubtless wasteful in some w r ays, and it seems hard on a poor country to have to support a royal family, which includes twenty- five princes and a corresponding number of princesses and queens, but there is no reason to think that any economy that would be compatible with the King’s position and oriental methods of accountancy would make a great difference to the budget. 4. The word “ budget ” is only used by convention, for it is porbable that the Saudi budget exists largely in the head of the able Nejdi, who is Ibn Saud’s Minister of Finance. Income is irregular and incalculable, and expenditure spasmodic. If the King wants money suddenly for some purpose the Minister of F inance must produce it somehow, and there are demands from the Amirs Saud and Faisal also to be met, and the simplest way to meet essential expen diture is to leave for some future time the payment for services rendered or goods supplied. All Saudi officials, except those who are in position to look after themselves, are permanently in arrears with their pay for periods ex tending at times to half a year. Many foreign chauffeurs, employed for the State cars, have been glad to recover, before leaving, a third or a quarter of arrears of pay extending back sometimes for two or three years. The Soviet Legation are still trying, apparently with no hope of success, to recover payment for oil products to the value of about £30,000, which they supplied to the Saudi Government in 1930. A Polish firm supplied a considerable quantity of arms to the Saudi Government in 1930, and it is believed that the efforts they made to recover the second half of the price were not successful. The difficulties which have beset our attempt to recover the cost of arms supplied by the Government of India at the time of the Nejd rebellion in 1929, arc only too well known to His Majesty’s Government. Although con siderable sums have been collected from pilgrims during the last two months, there are the usual signs of financial stringency. The Legation even had to appeal to the good offices of the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs for payment of the balance due to the Eastern Telegraph Company (Limited) for the period ending the 31st January ; the Saudi Government paid £1,000 and left over £2,000 outstanding. 5. The main difficulty is that in spite of his policy of economic develop ment Ibn Saud is still dependent almost entirely, either directly or indirectly, on the pilgrimage as a source of revenue. It is nearly a year now since there seemed to be ground for hope that oil would shortly be discovered in Hasa in commercial quantities, but this hope has not been fulfilled, though it is true that it has not been abandoned. The Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate have discovered a gold mine, or rediscovered an old one, with gold in what would ordinarily be paying quantities, but the water which would make it possible to w r ork the mine on an economic basis has not yet been found. The Petroleum Development (Western Arabia), (Limited), which has begun to prospect for oil along the coastal belt of the Pved Sea has no good news to *33 report. It is true that the prospectors have not been at work long, and it must also be remembered that an American company found oil at Bahrein where the Shell Company had given up the search, but the reports from the com pany’s experienced geologists, who seem to have covered most of the ground, have left the Jedda manager very gloomy. Two other possible sources ol wealth can be foreseen at present: that oil will be found in the Bub -al- Khali, and that somewhere in such parts of Arabia as are not included m the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate’s concession gold or some other valuable mineral will be found in quantities and in conditions that will repay the work ing. There can be little in the commercial schemes which are discussed in the Mecca press from time to time. It is not by selling to pilgrims small boxes of Medina dates that the Saudi budget will be made to meet at the back, nor by curing rather less badly the few skins the country has to export. Several grandiose schemes, which in succession raised Saudi hopes, have come to nothing. The chief of these were the Jedda-Mecca Railway, the Saudi State Bank, which the ea;-Khedive was supposed to be prepared to establish, and the loan of half a million or so which the Saudi Government hoped they could raise in England on rather vague security. 6. For the present, then, the Saudi Government are living on the pil grimage revenues supplemented by windfalls, such as advances in respect of the various concessions, the purchase by the Italian Government ox an unknown number of camels at absurdly high prices, and consignments ol arms, petrol, &amp;c., for which they have never paid. Thus, windfalls apart, Saudi Arabia is dependent upon a source of revenue on which not even the Heiaz alone had to live before the war, for there seems to be no doubt that the Ottoman Government put into the Hejaz, in the way of subsidies arid in over head expenses, more than they ever got out of it. The country being depen dent upon the pilgrimage, the size of the pilgrimage is of the first importance. The fluctuations of this manifestation of religious enthusiasm are weU known to vou The total of overseas pilgrims this year was about o0,000. in iJz it rose to 132,000, and in 1933 it fell to 21,000. The number of pilgrims falls in times of economic stress, but it is also affected by national policy and social changes, as in Soviet Russia, Turkey and Persia No Soviet citizens, and very few Turkish now come on the pilgrimage, and the number of 1 er- sians is diminishing. Statements made recently in the course of conversa tion by members of the Persian and Afghan Legations m Jedda suggest that their Governments regard the pilgrimage as a useless dram upon e national resources. On the other hand, it seems likely that the increasing feeling of Arab solidarity will help to maintain, if not to increase, the num er of pilgrims from Egypt, Syria and Palestine and perhaps Iraq, while m Moslem countries under European rule not only will the authorities be careful not to take any action which might be interpreted as interference with the pilgri mage, but nationalist feeling will probably tend to encourage the pilgrimage by Rising religious to supplement political feeling. But it seems unlikely that the average number of pilgrims will increase to such a point as to enable Ibn Sand to reduce the oppressive pilgrim dues, which he would doubtless be glad to do not only because he would be exposed to less criticism, but for religious reasons too. 7. I have redrawn above the familiar picture of Ibn Saud searching year after vear for normal sources of revenue, and thrown back time after time on the most invidious, viz., levy of toll upon Moslems making the pilgrimage to the shrine of Allah. It would not be surprising if this disposed him to class his country with the “ have-nots ”. And it happens that with the exception of the Yemen, which he refrained from annexing in 1935, partly out of consi deration for pan-Arab feeling, but partly no doubt for fear of Italy, he sees around him on the Arabian Peninsula more than one territory which he could absorb but for His Majesty’s Government, and whose absorption would be to his economic advantage. This does not apply to the south, for whatever nolitical attraction the Hadhramaut may have for him, it contains no obvious form of material wealth. But on the Persian Gulf the situation is different There is one small sheikh in possession of the fine natural harbour ol Koweit and a pearl fishery, and in far too favourable a position for smuggling into baudi territory. Another sheikh so small that Ibn Saud always refers to him by a 55(C) ExAffairaDept #34 familiar nickname, not only claims the whole of the Qatar Peninsula, including a hill that Ibn Saud particularly wants for himself, but has granted an oil concession like an independent sovereign. Running down the coast are various insignificant people whose only purpose in life seems to be to bar Ibn Saud from the sea, from any oil that may be discovered there, and from any pickings that might be got out of Imperial Airways. Finally, there is Bahrein, which used to belong to Ibn Saud’s ancestors but now stands more or less on its own feet, and which, moreover, has an oil well gushing away as if in mockery of the miserable seepings in the wells which have been bored in Hasa. And in all these territories His Majesty’s Government have “ interests ” which prevent their being absorbed, as much to their own as to the general advantage, in Saudi Arabia. Such is the picture which Ibn Saud may be expected to paint to himself. 8. In these circumstances it is reasonable to suppose that although Ibn Saud seems to have decided that on the whole His Majesty’s Government are to be preferred to the Itahans as freinds, the recognition of our interests in Arabia puts a great strain upon a monarch who is not only ambitious but probably insolvent too. It might be argued that the poorer Ibn Saud is the less likely he is to engage in a policy of adventure, but my own opinion is that on the whole a more generous view is justified, viz., that anything that in creases his legitimate revenue is to be welcomed by His Majesty’s Govern ment, and any expenditure that might erm&amp;irrass his finances is to be depre cated. To increase his revenue is not in our power, for without giving pil grims money, as the Italians have done this year for propaganda purposes, we can hardly do more to facilitate the accomplishment of the pilgrimage by British pilgrims than is done already. We can, however, apply the second principle to any scheme which comes up for consideration. In my despatch No. 20, dated the 10th February, I applied this principle to the suggestion that His Majesty’s Government might perhaps help in the reconstruction of the Saudi portion of the Hejaz Railway, and opposed it chiefly on the ground that the railway would be a fianancial liability to Ibn Saud and not an asset. If it could be shown that the railway would not be a burden on Saudi finances, the proposal would, I think, deserve reconsideration. The principle enters into the consideration of other questions affecting the relations of His Ma jesty’s Government with Saudi Arabia, but it is unnecessary to go into details here. (24) {Received on 22nd May 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 18, dated 6th May 1937.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 29th April 1937. Letter from Minister, Jedda,'to Foreign Office, No. 40, dated the 12th April 1937. Jedda, March 23, 1937. Mr. Rendel’s tour in the Near and Middle East brought him to Jedda on the 17th March, a few days after Ibn Saud’s first appearance in Jedda since my arrival at this post last September, and when I presented Mr. Rendel to him I had myself only seen him once, a few day^ before, and that only for a short call such as was paid by all the foreign representatives in Jedda. It was to be expected that Ibn Saud would wish to use this opportunity to speak of various matters affecting the relations between His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia and after we had had two meetings on current questions with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba we were invited to call on His Majesty for a conversation on matters of mutual interest. This re-. sulted in three meetings lasting some two hours or more each, and a fourth which might have lasted as long had not Mr. Rendel been obliged to leave to catch his steamer for Egypt. 2. Fuad Bey had left Jedda unexpectedly a few days before Mr. Rendel’s arrival. The alleged reason for his departure at a moment when the presence of the Deputy Foreign Minister might have been regarded as essential was the health ot his little boy, about whom he professed to be exceedingly anxious but information from other quarters does not bear out the plea that the child35 was seriously ill, and it may be that his jealousy of Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, the Saudi Minister in London, who would naturally be present at any interviews accorded to Mr. Rendel, made him glad to leave, and that the King, who per haps does not trust him fully, was glad to let him take a holiday. During one of our conversations the King mentioned with emphasis as the three men he trusted Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and his son Faisal, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Amir joined the group on two occasions, the other two were present throughout. From statements made during the conversations, I am forced to conclude that 1 have been misled by Fuad Bey on one or two points, and for this reason, and also because of the general pro- Italian reputation which he has acquired, it is impossible to believe that conversations such as we had could have been as full and as frank had Fuad Bey been present. 3. The lavish hospitality which Ibn Saud always displays to guests threatened to assume an alarmingly public character in Jedda. We were embarrassed to discover that not only were dinners to Mr. Rendel to be given by the King and the Amir Faisal—festivities which might be taken as a rea sonable return for hospitality enjoyed by the Amirs Saud and Faisal in Eng land.—but a dinner was to be given by Sheikh Abdullah Sulaiman, the Minister of Finance. At our request the third dinner was cancelled, but it was re placed by a tea-party, which was attended by the King. The personal character of the party was, however, emphasised by the presence of Mrs. Rendel. The King made a very rare exception to his rule not to receive European ladies, and had her placed in the seat of honour on his right. 4. Not only did we endeavour to avoid some of the external signs of an official visit, but Mr. Rendel was careful to explain, both at the beginning of his visit to Jedda and also just before his departure, that his journey was personal and private. It was undertaken, he explained, in response to the generous invitation of His Highness the Amir Saud. Nevertheless, he had taken the opportunity to study carefully on the spot various matters affect ing Anglo-Saudi relations, in particular the Qatar boundary, and he would be glad if he could assist in arriving at a settlement of this or of any other outstanding question. 5. At my urgent request Mr. Rendel took the leading part whenever there was a question of explaining the point of view of His Majesty’s Govern ment on matters of importance. This was not only reasonable in that he was merely going again over ground covered on many occasions with the Saudi representative in London, but there was the even more cogent reason that Ibn Saud would certainly expect to hear the views of an official of the Foreign Office who, to his knowledge, had dealt with Saudi affairs for many years. I venture to believe that Mr. Rendel’s visit and the conversations to which it gave rise have been of the greatest value, and will have helped to launch my personal relations with His Majesty under the happiest auspices. Cer tainly nothing could have been more cordial, friendly and familiar than the King’s words and manner, which never changed, however delicate the point under discussion, and it was interesting to learn from my new Italian col league, with our interviews fresh in my mind, that he had found the King extremely guarded, and concluded that he was an extremely clever fellow^ who would never commit himself. 6. I am fully conscious of the danger that excessive cordiality at the beginning of an acquaintance may lead to disappointment later on. As I informed the Foreign Office in personal letters soon after my arrival, I found that the King regarded me, on the strength of quite normal official letters written by me' to King Hussein in 1923-25 and discovered in the Shereefian archives after the fall of Jedda, as a partisan of Ibn Sand’s, and I regretted this assumption, since the oriental builds far too much upon personalities and the King might expect to gain impossible favours from His Majesty’s Government through my efforts and might afterwards be more dissatisfied at failure than if he had never entertained any hope of success. Similarly there is the danger that he may build too much upon Mr. Rendel’s visit, and jnay hope to influence His Majesty’s Government in matters where it is not possible for them to make concessions or grant favours. But it is sufficient36 to keep this danger in mind. On the whole I am sure that the cordial conver sions have been of very great value. 7. The subjects discussed during Mr. Renders visit were these: (1) With Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba : — (a) Qatar frontier. {b) Transjordan frontier. (c) Koweit blockade. (2) With the King, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba being present :— (a) The general relations of Saudi Arabia with His Majesty’s Gov ernment (this includes the Qatar frontier and relations with the Persian Gulf rulers in general). (b) Relations of Saudi Arabia with Italy. (c) The Yemen (with the Italians in the background). {d) Iraq (with the Turks in the background). (e) An appeal for assistance from His Majesty’s Government (not dealt with in detail except tojaome extent in regard to aviation). (/) Palestine. These questions, which frequently overlapped each other in the course of the conversations, will be dealt with in detail by telegram or despatch. 8. Copies of this despatch are being sent to Cairo, Jerusalem, Bagdad, Bushire and Aden. (25) (Received on 22nd May 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No f 18, dated 6th May 1937.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 30th April 1937. Letter from Minister, Jedda, to Foreign Office, No. 41, dated the 12th April 1937, Jedda, March 23, 1937. In my despatch No. 40, dated the 23rd March, I reported that during Mr. Rendel’s short stay in Jedda, from the 17th to 22nd March, we had several interviews with His Majesty King Abdul Aziz. I now have the honour to enclose a summary of these conversations. The conversations themselves and unavoidable hospitality occupied most of the time during the last two and half days, so that there was not time to make a complete record before Mr. Rendel’s departure. 2. It might have been more satisfactory to divide the record up into portions according to the various subjects discussed, and to send each portion separately with a covering despatch, but there is not time to do this before the bag goes, and in any case the subjects overlap a good deal. Where com ment seems to be called for I hope to send it by the following bag, and the question of Palestine, at any rate, requires a telegram. 3. In two or three places I have inserted material which may appear to be remote from present-day politics, e.g., references to Ibn Saud’s relations with the Sherif (later King) Hussein and to his dealings with British officials in the Persian Gulf before the war. I think these references are relevant as showing that the mind of the King is always roving back to the times when, as he thinks, he deserved well of His Majesty’s Government and reflecting that he has got precious little out of it. I am not saying, at the moment, that any bitterness that Ibn Saud feels on this score is justified but only that it exists. 4. I have been more than six months at this post, but it was not until now that I could come into contact with the man who directs foreign affairs, as he directs everything else in Saudi Arabia. The peculiar position in which foreign representatives are placed in this country is familiar to you, but itmay be of use to illustrate it from my short experience. I arrived at Jedda in the middle of last September, and presented credentials to and dined with the Amir Feisal, a purely nominal Minister for Foreign Affairs, who at once re treated to the hills of Taif. The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fuad Bey, was on leave, and did not return until towards the end of November, and for two months I saw no none connected with foreign affairs except the King’s secretary, Yusuf Yasin, who came to Jedda at the end of September to arrange for the exchange of notes about the Treaty of Jedda and connected matters, communicated a long statement from the King about foreign affairs, and retired to the other side of Arabia. Between the return of Fuad Bey towards the end of November and his hurried and surprising departure on leave a few days before Mr. Rendel was due to arrive, I have had occasional interviews—sometimes at tiresomely long intervals—with Fuad Bey, whom there is reason to think that the King does not entirely trust, and who I think has misled me on one or two occasions. 5. I may mention that during the course of the conversations reported in the enclosure the King twice said that he hoped I would pay him a visit at Riyadh. For many reasons such a visit is not to be undertaken lightly, but it may be useful to have the invitation in hand if matters of importance have to be dealt with and no satisfaction can be obtained here during the long interval between two successive annual visits of the King to Jedda, the only place in Saudi Arabia where a foreign representative is allowed to reside. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to Cairo, Jeru salem, Bagdad, Bushire and Aden. Enclosure to letter No. 41, dated the 12th April 1937. Record of conversations in the course of interviews granted by His Majesty King Abdul Aziz to Sir Reader Bullard and Mr. Rendel on March 20, 21 and 22, 1937. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba were present throughout, and the Amir Feisal appeared on two occasions. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and Sir Reader Bullard interpreted. First Interview, March 20. The King began by laying down the pirnciples which governed his life : (1) his religion, (2) his determination to keep his name above reproach, and (3) devotion to his religion and to the interests of his subjects. He was a self-made man, having started with nothing in the world, and provided that he stuck to his principles he was prepared to go back to nothing. Times were changing, the pristine honesty of the world was declining, but he would never pursue a crooked path. He believed in consulting everyone, but no one could lead him by the nose. He would always speak to His Majesty’s Government frankly and sincerely. All sorts of stories were afloat about his subservience to the Italians, but he could assure His Majesty’s Government that they were nonsense. Mr. Rendel said how much the King’s frankness was appreciated by members of the Government in Great Britain, and Sir Reader Bullard said that he was sure that the King was never suspected by His Majesty’s Government of subservience to Italy, and that His Majesty’s Government knew that his policy was directed to what was their object as well as his, viz., the maintenance of the independence of Saudi Arabia. 2. Ibn Saud said that he was a Moslem first of all, but he believed that of all the European Powers the one with whom it was to the advantage of the Arabs everywhere to be on good terms was Great Britain. After some talk on these lines Sir Reader Bullard took the opportunity to convey the thanks .of His Majesty’s Government for the advice which the King had given to the Mufti of Jerusalem when the mufti appealed for his help recently (Foreign Office telegram No. 12 of the 1st March). The King expressed pleasure at this mark of appreciation of his efforts and repeated wdiat he had said to the mufti (he had advised him to co-operate with the British in maintaining order and to await the result of the Royal Commission), and he said that h3 had 65(C) ExAffairsDept38 also warned the mufti not to let himself be made an instrument for Italian intrigues. He went on to say that he wanted the whole “ bundle ” of Arab states to be on good terms with His Majesty’s Government. He was not thinking of Palestine for the moment; that question was being considered, and he trusted that a solution would be found that would be satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government, to the people of Palestine, and to the Arabs in general. No, he was thinking of danger which threatened the Arab world in two places, the Yemen, and Iraq. 3. First the Yemen. The Yemen was in a ferment. The whole country was against the heir apparent. Ahmad, while the Imam said “ yes ” to every one, but did nothing. When three of the sons of the Imam came on the pil grimage recently, Sayyid Husain spoke to the King about the situation in the Yemen and asked for his advice. If there was a revolt in the Yemen, what would be the attitude of (1) Ibn Saud, and (2) the Italians ? According to Sayyid Husain—and Ibn Saud knew it to be true—the whole population without exception hated Ahmad and the Foreign Minister, Raghib, a Turk who is in Italian pay. They had asked for the removal of Raghib, but he was protected by Ahmad. They had sent the Imam a written protest (here the King gave us a copy), but without effect. If they were free they would revolt and sweep away both Raghib and Ahmad, and the Imam too if he opposed this popular movement. 4. To this enquiry from Saj^yid Husain, Ibn Saud said he had replied that, as for himself, he proposed to observe a policy of complete neutrality and non-intervention in Yemen affairs. He had withdrawn once when he might have occupied the Yemen, and he did not propose to reverse that policy. If there should be trouble in the Yemen, the most he could do would be to consult other Arab countries if asked by both sides to try to make peace, and to see what could be done to give effect to the request. As to Great Britain and Italy, Ibn Saud had told Husain about the Rome understanding of 1927, and had said that both the British and the Italians had assured him that it v as their firm desire that the independence of the Yemen should be maintained. In conclusion, Ibn Saud declared vehemently that there must be an outbreak in the Yemen—perhaps before the death of the Imam. In that event, what M ould the Italians do and what would be the attitude of His Majesty’s Government ? 5. Mr. Rendel replied that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciated the dangers of the situation in the Yemen. There was no doubt that the Italians had been, and still are, intriguing actively in that country and would be very ready to fish in the Maters they had helped to trouble. But while the internal situation was perhaps more dangerous than it had been, he was inclined, for the following reasons and speaking purely personally, to doubt M r hether the Italian danger was now quite as acute as it had been a year ago. In the Rome understanding of 1927 His Majesty’s Government had made it quite clear, and the Italians had formally recognised, that His Majesty’s Government regarded it as “ a vital imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself q^ the Arabian shore of the Red Sea. ” (At this point Sir Reader Bullard gave King Ibn Saud, for convenience of reference, a copy of an Arabic translation of the relevent text, which had already been com municated to His Majesty by Sir Andrew Ray an.) There was, of course, no reason to trust any Italian promises as such, but it w^as obvious that, in view of the terms of the Rome understanding, any attempt by Italy to estab lish herself in the Yemen would be a direct challenge to His Majesty’s Gov ernment. No doubt Italian hot heads, possibly Italian local officials, cherish ed designs on the Yemen. But Italian policy would be directed from Rome, and present indicatons suggested that for European reasons, and in view of British rearmament, Italy was not now anxious to embark on any conflict M r ith His Majesty’s Government, but was rather seeking to establish better relations. Even if this view should prove mistaken, he did not think King Ibn Saud need be seriously disturbed by Italian activities in the Yemem Saudi and British interests were closely parallel, and it was difficult to see how any development Mdiich threatened Saudi independence could fail equally to threaten British interests, so that the probability was that, in any such event, Ibn Saud would, in any case, find Great Britain at his side. At a later43 * v 39 interview the opportunity was taken to mention that the Italians themselves seemed anxious to keep the Rome understanding alive, and apparently feared a forward policy on the part of His Majesty’s Government (see Foreign Office despatch to Jedda, No. 182 of the 24th February). 6. Mr. Rendel added that he understood (from Sheikh Hafiz Wahba) that His Majesty wished to know the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards his suggestion for an exchange of information about the Yemen, &amp;c. Mr. Rendel saw no reason why this should not be possible. His Majesty’s Government would be glad to pass on to Ibn Saud any information of interest which they could properly communicate to him, though in doing this they would, of course, be assuming that Ibn Saud was satisfied that there would be no risk of leakage at the Saudi end. 7. Ibn Saud then turned to Iraq. He had good information, for people wrote to him from all parts of the Arab world and he had seen many Iraqi pilgrims, and the reports ail tallied with each other. Everyone was suspicious of the new Iraqi Government and regarded it as not Arab. There had been much to be said against Yasin-al-Hashimi, who had even gone so far as to ask Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to tell Ibn Saud to beware of the British Govern ment, but at least his policy was an Arab policy. To the policy of the present Iraqi Government there were two objections : it was communistic, and it was under Turkish influence. The Turks had begun by trying to get possession of the Sanjak of Alexandretta, and their next aim would be to ac quire Mosul. 8. Mr. Rendel said that the title of Communist was sometimes misapplied to any one who favoured economic social reform. He understood that such reforms were long overdue in Iraq, where there was much extreme poverty, and it was possible that Hikmet Suleiman’s legislation was necessary, and was not imposed in any spirit of communism. It might be well, therefore, to reserve judgment on this point until the Amir Saud and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba should have seen the situation for themselves during their impending visit to Bagdad. (Here Ibn Saud said that Hikmet Suleiman did not care a rap for the poor or for anyone.) As to Turkish influence, Mr. Rendel believed that, while the maker of the military coup d'Etat, Bakr Sidqi, and some of his military associates, might be described as pro-Turkish, Hikmet Suleiman showed signs of wanting to shake himself free of military influence, and the longer he could maintain his Government, the more hope there was that he would become less dependent on the army’s support. As to the attitude of the Turkish Government, a year ago Mr. Rendel would have scouted the sug gestion that Turkey might embark on a policy of adventure. In this opinion he had been seriously shaken by Turkey’s Alexandretta policy, but the Turks had not “ got away with it ” over Alexandretta, and they had, he thought, felt themselves much isolated at Geneva and had retreated from the extreme position they had taken up. The fact that the Turks had received so marked a check over Alexandretta ought, he felt, to make them much less likely to put forward any other similar claims in future. Second Interview, March 21. 9. Ibn Saud said that he w r anted to make some remarks under four heads :— (1) His relations with His Majesty’s Government. (2) The Arabs in General. (3) Palestine. (4) The future. The interview went on for over two hours, but never got beyond the first head. Ibn Saud went over the whole course of his relations with His Majesty’s Government from the moment when he first entered into communication with them through the Political Agent at Bahrein, and suggested that their common interests demanded that the Turks should not be allowed to establish them selves strongly in the Arabian Peninsula, and received an assurance that His Majesty’s Government would not allow the Turks to approach him either by sea or through Koweit. He recited his dealings with Sir Percy Cox during40 the war, recalled the loyalty with which he had offered to help the Sherif Hussein against the Turks, and spoke of the “ guarantees ” which he had received from Sir Percy Cox. Nothing whatever had come of^these “ guarantees,’’ though he had been promised “ all sorts of things. ” He had assisted the Arab policy of His Majesty’s Government by communicating to them the written and oral offers which he received from the lurks as an inducement to him to join them against Hussein—offers which he refused, alleging that he could not move against the British because they were his neighbours on the Gulf, and saying that, in any case, he could not join the Turks when they were slaughtering Arabs. At first he even told His Majesty’s Government that he would accept Hussein as King of the Arabs, but later he was obliged to withdraw this offer. He told Hussein that the resources in money and arms which were supplied by the British were being wasted through' being dealt out to the various sheikhs according to the number of followers they said they had, and asked that, if he sent his son and some men to help, they should only be given arms for themselves and food to eat, and Hussein had replied that Ibn Saud must be either mad or drunk. Ibn Saud thereupon informed the British Government that he must lay down two con ditions : that he would not recognise Hussein as King of the Arabs, though he did not object to his being King of the Hejaz, and that when the war was over His Majesty’s Government should allow him to settle his own scores with Hussein. He had always listened to the advice of His Majesty’s Government, even to his own hurt. On more than one occasion he had fallen out with his chief supporters, the Ikhwan, for that reason, e.q., when he retook Turaba which the Sherifians had unjustly occupied, and His Majesty’s Government asked him not to go any further ; when he refrained at the request cf His Majesty’s Government from taking Aqaba, where the ex-King Hussein was staying, and Maan ; and when he listened to the mediation of the British agent at Jedda and ensured the peaceful occupation of the city to the disappoint ment of some of his followers. For all this loyal support, and after all the promises made to him, what had he got ? Nothing whatever. On the contrary ! 10. He would put his complaints under three heads :— (a) His Majesty’s Government had not given him the help he needed. (?&gt;) Their boundary policy was always squeezing him in. (c) By their Gulf policy they tried to make him dependent commercially on Koweit and Bahrein. Whereas a friend in need of help looked to a more powerful friend to assist him, he had had no help from His Majesty’s Government. Look what His Majesty’s Government had done for Egypt and Iraq ! Those countries might be richer than Saudi Arabia, but Saudi Arabia could, in his opinion, be more useful than either to His Majesty’s Government. 11. After expressing great interest in the valuable historical survey which the King had given, but pointing out that what we had to adopt as a basis was the facts of to-day, Mr. Rendel suggested that one difficulty was that, whereas countries like Egypt and Iraq, which contained rich natural resources, could be developed by commercial enterprises which would earn their own profits, Saudi Arabia did not at present appear to be economically in that category. If, however, Ibn Saud had any particular kind of help in mind and would specify what it was, he could be sure that the suggestion would be considered very carefully. Ibn Saud said that there were all sorts of help that he might mention, but he would sjjeak first of aviation, to which he attached great importance. He had sent to His Majesty’s Minister through “ that man ” (pointing to Sheikh Yusuf Y 7 asin) a suggestion about the training of Saudis in aviation in Great Britain. As to the Italians, he swore as a Moslem and an Arab that when the Italian aeroplanes arrived, he wished that Allah would destroy the machines and the men in them. Mr. Rendel reminded the King that the failure of other countries to follow our example in reducing armaments had compelled us to rearm, and that the expansion of the British air force was employing to the full all our resources for the manufacture of aeroplanes and the training of men as pilots and mechanics, and that, while % 041 this should tend to deter other nations from disturbing the peace of the world and should therefore be of advantage to His Majesty, it made it more difficult than it would otherwise have been to give His Majesty direct assistance in matters of aviation. Nevertheless, if His Majesty would make specific suggestions, they would be examined most carefully and sympathetically. 12. The subject was again referred to at a later meeting the same day. Mr. Rendel repeated his warning about the peculiar difficulties created by the pre-occupation of His Majesty’s Government with their scheme of rearmament, and spoke of the necessity for co-ordination of skilled men with suitable machines if time and money spent on training and equipment were not to be wasted, and of the possibility that Saudi Arabia, having a very small urban population among which to find men with a suitable preliminary training in mechanical work, &amp;c., might find it more difficult than, e.g., Egypt, to pro duce suitable candidates for aviation work. Sir Header Bullard suggested that, whereas it might suit the Italians to undertake the training ot any number of Saudis because of the political effect it might be expected to have, His Majesty’s Government would be reluctant to embark on any scheme that would not have a reasonable chance of success. He also asked the King what His Majesty thought would be the effect upon the Italians of any close rela tionship between His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia in matters of aviation. Was there any reason to think that this might encourage them to seek to extend their influence elsewhere, e.g., in the Yemen ? It was true that the Italians had themse’.ves wished to identify themselves closely with Saudi Arabia in aviation affairs, but how far was that merely a phase of the war with Ethiopia and their hostility to His Majesty’s Government on that point ’ The King said that the Italians still wished to be allowed to develop Saudi aviation, and implied that he didn’t care what they thought. He added bitterlv that the pilots trained in Italy were no good. At one point in the conversation the King said that if Iraq shook itself free of Turkish influence he would not mind having some Iraqis to help in aviation later on. 13. It was arranged that Sheikh Yusuf \asin should prepare for His Majesty’s Minister a note of the Saudi requirements in aviation matters. This note, Ibn Saud was assured, would receive the most careful attention. Third Interview, March 21. 14. The King said that he wanted to speak about his future in relation to His Majesty’s Government. He began with a long and rather pointless account of the negotiations for the Saudi-Iraq Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. In so far as it has a point it was intended to show the Iraqis as rather slippery customers. At Riyadh, said the King, Naji-al-Asil suggested to Ibn Saud that Iraq should deal with His Majesty’s Government in the matter of Palestine on behalf of Ibn Saud, and that Ibn Saud should deal with the Imam about his adhesion to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty. Ibn Saud had expressed surprise at this request, and had said that both States must act together in both matters. He spoke of what appeared to be a similar attempt to side-track him in the matter of securing the adhesion of the Imam to the treaty. He then spoke of the surprise he had felt at the Iraqis wanting to insert in the treaty a reference to the League of Nations, of which Saudi Arabia was not a member, and added that the Imam would never consent to sicn anything in which there was a reference to the League. Mr. Rendel explained that members of the League could not assume any obligation which might be incompatible with their existing obligations under the Convenant, and that they were therefore bound to make a reservation to that effect in anv treaty involving military assistance, &amp;c. Moreover, Iraq was also bound bv the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, which, as His Majesty’s Government had pointed out to the Iraqi Government, involved a similar reservation on the part of Iraq. Mr. Rendel said that, of course, such a reservation w;ould not affect a party not a member of the League, and that consequently neither Saudi Arabia nor the Yemen would be affected by such a reservation on the part of Iraq. 15. The King then said that he had often been asked whether the Arab States of the Persian Gulf could not adhere to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty. He 65. Cl Ex Allan sDept42 had fended off such enquiries, alleging the unimportance of such States, hut he would be glad to know the opinion of His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Rendel reminded His Majesty of the position of His Majesty’s Government in the Gulf. They had had relations with the Arab rulers there in some cases for as long as a century and a half, having been compelled to take action in regard to gun-running, piracy, the slave trade, &amp;c. As a result, as had been made clear at the time of the Treaty of Jedda, the foreign affairs of Koweit, Bahrein, Qatar and the Trucial Sheikhdoms were in the hands of His Majesty’s Government, who exercised sovereignty over them in those affairs and there fore could not allow them to enter into treaty relations with any foreign State, Ibn Sand seemed to accept this statement without demur. 16. This subject led to the question of the frontiers. Mr. Rendel repeated the arguments which he used with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 19th March, saying that His Majesty’s Government had made great concessions in this respect, whereas His Majesty was holding firmly to his original demand. In the northern part of the eastern frontier there remained nothing between the parties but the Jabal Naksh and Khor-el-Odeid, with perhaps an adjustment in the Sufuk (Safaq) region that might go some way towards meeting the King’s wishes. Could not His Majesty make some concession here ? It would make an excellent impression on the Foreign Office if he could. Ibn Saud repeated his familiar statement that the whole of the coast belonged to his ancestors and that the present rulers would not deny it. Koweit, for instance ; all the tribes living in Koweit were really Saudi tribes. It was true that he had recognised the treaties between the coastal rulers and His Majesty’s Government in the Hadda Agreement, l 1 ) but on the question of the boundaries there was a limit beyond which he could not go. The boundary of Qatar was well known to be Araik, which was in the nufud. 17. The maps which were at hand were examined, but Araik was not marked on them. Sir Reader Bullard said that he had seen a map on which, unless his memory was at fault, Araik was shown to the south of Jabal Naksh. In that case there would no longer be any disagreement on that point. 18. As to Khor-el-Odied, Ibn Saud said that, in claiming it for Saud Arabia, he was thinking of the interests of His Majesty’s Government as much as of his own, for no one but himself could keep order there. When crimes were committed there it was to him that the people applied for redress. 19. The King seemed very anxious to pass on to another subject. It appeared at first that he was wanting to evade the boundary question, but when the other subject came to be broached it was found to be a question of capital importance. What, the King asked, would happen to him in the case of war ? Suppose war began in Europe, or in the Yemen or anywhere ? Could not His Majesty’s Government make some treaty or some other lesser undertaking wdth him ? It could be secret if they wished. 20. Mr. Rendel said that any such undertaking, and more especially any kind of secret guarantee, was precluded by the British constitutional system, which would in any case make its eventual fulfilment uncertain. Sir R. Bullard added that His Majesty’s Government were obliged, as members of the League of Nations, to register all treaties with the League. Mr. Rendel then went on to say, as he had said the previous day, that he could hardly imagine any occasion on which a threat to Saudi Arabia would not be a threat to His Majesty’s Government, and added that this community of interests was a stronger bond than many a treaty. We had given too many promises in the past, under pressure of war in particular, and could not give one in this case. Sir Reader Bullard reminded the King once more of the terms of the Rome Agreement of 1927. His Majesty’s Government had recorded in writing that they regarded it as a “ vital imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea”. The King seemed to derive comfort from this conversation. Fourth Interview, March 22. 21. The King said that in this the last conversation before Mr. Rendel’s departure he wished to speak about Palestine. The Arabs were now really ( T ) Tills reference should be to Article 6 of tho Treaty of Jedda.alarmed by the Zionist policy. They feared that a Jewish Government would be established in Palestine and would include Transjordan in its scope, and they were even beginning to fear that there might be designs on Medina itself, the burial-place of the Prophet Mahomed. Some of these fears might be exaggerated, and due to irresponsible talk by individual Jews, but there was also genuine ground for apprehension, and he himself was very anxious about the question. Great Britain was powerful and could crush the Arab opposi tion, but he feared that there might be dangerous repercussions in other Moslem countries in which His Majesty’s Government had special interests, Egypt, Iraq and India. There were many enemies watching for an opportunity to injure Great Britain. The chief of these was, of course, Italy. The attempt that Italy was making to win recognition as the friend of Moslems in general and of the Arabs in particular was well known. The Italians had used the pilgrimage for propaganda purposes, and had done their best to induce him to speak in praise of their pro-Moslem policy. He had resisted this attempt, and he had no belief whatever in Italian professions, for he knew what had happened in Tripoli and in Abyssinia, but there was a real danger from the Italians, nevertheless, if the troubles in Palestine should flare up again. Nor were the Turks inactive. They had many agents in Palestine, who never failed to rub it into the Arabs that the result of their revolt against the Turks was subordination to the Jews. The Zionist policy, as it was being carried out at present, was contrary to British interests, and that was one reason why he was against it. As a Moslem and an Arab he naturally sympathised with the Arabs of Palestine. He had suppressed these personal feelings hitherto out of friendship for His Majesty’s Govern ment, and he could always suppress his feelings if policy required it. But the Zionist policy was not even in the interests of Great Britain. Moreover, His Majesty’s Government must realise that he stood alone, and that he had to think of his position in a Moslem world where he was the butt of much criticism, and where many of his co-religionists would not even admit that he was a Moslem. He felt that he had come to the end of what he could do in the matter of Palestime. 22. His Majesty was assured that his views would be communicated to His Majesty’s Government without delay. 23. Ibn Saud said that he had one last question. Suppose that there was trouble in the Yemen and the Italians asked him about it, as they might very well do ; what should he say ? Should he reply to this effect :■— He did not propose to interfere in the internal affairs of the Yemen, and the Rome understanding of 1927, the relevant part of which had been communicated to him by the Italians as well as by the British, seemed to require them both to adopt a similar attitude of non-inter vention. Mr. Rendel said that this reply seemed to meet the circumstances exactly. ( 26 ) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 30th April 1937. Letter from Minister, Jedda, to Foreign Office , No. 44, dated the 12th April 1937. Jedda, March 25, 1937. In the summary of conversations with Ibn Saud which I had the honour to submit as an enclosure to my despatch No. 41, dated the 23rd March, the question of the Yemen was referred to in paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 23. I now transmit a summary of the document which the King handed to me when we were dealing with this subject. The document is a multigraphed copy of a typewritten original in Arabic, in the form of an open letter to the Imam. I understood from Ibn Saud that the letter had been distributed widely in the Yemen. It urges the Imam to designate his son Husain as his successor,44 A » instead of Ahmad, and to begin now to train Husain for the task of govern ment. There is a pan-Arab touch in the request that two Moslems from Syria* Egypt or Iraq should sit on the Council of Notables whose formation is recommended. In so far as foreign interference is referred to, it appears that the British are placed on the same level as the Italians. 2. Ibn Saud spoke with great earnestness about the certainty that trouble must break out in the Yemen on the Imam’s death, if not before. The open letter assures the Imam that a revolt will break out before his honourable coffin has reached the cemetery. The open letter might be a piece of pro paganda for Husain with nothing behind it, for all I could tell, for I have little direct knowledge about the Yemen, but Ibn Saud was doubtless telling the truth when he claimed to be very well informed. He referred to the Wazir family as being with the rest of the Yemen against Ahmad. It will be remembered that Muhammad-al-Wazir came on the pilgrimage this year. He shared to some extent in the honours paid to the three sons of the Imam by Ibn Saud. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to Cairo and Aden. Enclosure to letter No. 44, dated 12th Apiil 1937. Summary of the Contents of an Open Letter addressed to the Imam Yahya and j j Th ^ Loyal Tongue of the Naiion The Imam’s rule has been partly good and partly bad, but his piety has caused, and still causes, his people to overlook the bad things and to be loyal to him’and to his house. However, times are changing and men with them, so he 'would be well advised to listen to franlky uttered counsels. He wishes his son Ahmad to succeed him. Such a succession would be disastrous, for Ahmad is incapable of governing ; in such an event the people would be dissatisfied, and, on the death of the Imam \ ahya, they would rise in armed revolt. The agreements entered into with England and Italy, w ith a view to strengthening Ahmad’s position, would prove valueless. The w riter then advises the Imam as follows :— (1) To consult the Amirs, Ministers and officials as to the man they consider a suitable successor to the Imamate. It does not follow, of course, that they will speak their minds freely. (2) To proclaim A1 Husain as his successor and initiate him, in the Imam’s lifetime, into the w^ork of government wdth the assist ance of a council of notables. Among the members of such a council should be two Moslem leaders or upright men from Syria, Egypt or Iraq. This would be welcome to the people who consider A1 Husain an honest and pious man, and would mean the frustration of foreign designs. (3) To persuade Ahmad to surrender his rights for the common weal V and recompense him by giving him the Amirate of Hejah, with the revenues thereof, on condition that he takes his orders from the capital. (4) To promote unity among his sons and send some of them to Egypt K to be educated at A1 Azhar or some other institution, under the supervision of tutors appointed by him and by the Egyptian Government. Haste is urged in putting these suggestions into execution, and the Imam is told that his adherence to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty will strengthen the Yemen ; thus there is no need to fear foreigners. The importance of his recognising Ai Husain during his lifetime is stressed once again, as is the importance ot Al Husain’s travelling in Egypt, Syria and Iraq in order that he may see how foreign countries are ruled.45 (27) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 10th May 1937. Letter from Minister, Jedda, to Foreign Office, No. 46, dated the 19th April 1937. Jedda, March 27, 1937. To complete the record of the conversations with Ibn Sand which was sent to you as the enclosure to my despatch No. 41 dated the 23rd March, I have the honour to transmit translations of two documents :— (1) A letter from Sheikh Yusuf Yasin in reply to a letter which I had written to him in the sense of paragraph 17 of the record. I had said that a map in our possession showed Araik as between Qasr-as-Salwa and Jabal Naksh, and had asked whether His Majesty’s definition did not leave Jabal Naksh to Qatar, but Sheikh Yusuf Yasin’s letter does not admit my contention, and implies that there is another Araik (Uraiq) between Jabal Dukhan and Jabal Naksh. (2) A note in which Ibn Saud amplifies statements made by him, in the course of the conversations, about his position in regard to the Arab rulers on the Persian Gulf. 2. The questions referred to in these enclosures will be dealt with separately. 3. Copies of this despatch and enclosures are being sent to Cario, Jeru salem, Bagdad, Bushire and Aden. Enclosure 1 to letter No. 46, dated the 19th April 1937. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to Sir B. Bullard. (Translation.) Dear Sir Reader Bullard, Jedda, March 23, 1937, The moment I received your Excellency’s letter of the 23rd march, 1937, I hastened to put right the point which your Excellency raised. In the inter view I had in haste with your Excellency at your house just before noon on Tuesday the 10th Muharram (22nd March, 1937), I explained to you that ^ I did not believe that His Majesty the King, in his conversation to which you referred meant A1 Ureyq but Dukhan. There was a slip of the tongue. After I left your Excellency I enquired of His Majesty concermng the actual fact, and His Majesty stated that he did not intend that place, which is south of Naksh but the one which is south of Dukhan, which makes Naksh within the Saudi ? Arab Kingdom. During the conversation His Majesty did not think of giving up the claim concerning the frontiers put forward by the Go vernment of His Majesty. His Majesty’s statement was accidental and did not concern the details of the case. The question was not one of discussing the -exact position of the frontiers, and I therefore think the question still stands where it did. Enclosure 2. Note by Ibn Saud amplifying his Statements about his Position in regard to ' the Arab Rulers on the Persian Gulf. (Translation.) I have spoken clearly about the historical stages in the relations between me and the British Government, all of which have been courteous and consis tently amicable on my part, and sometimes on the part of the British. But 55(C) ExAffairu D eptwhat filled me with misgiving, much annoyed me and affected my honour are the two following points :— (1) The question of the frontiers of Qatar, Oman and other principa* lities of the Gulf. (2) The question of trade and marine transport. As regards the first point, these territories themselves, as you are aware, were under the suzerainty of my ancestors, and until the time of my grand father, Faisal, paid an annual tax for the preservation of the relationship of vassal to overlord. But in view of our desire for the continuation of our friendship with the British Government and the said Amirs to whom we are bound by old ties, we have recognised their positions in the Persian Gulf and their principalities, and have respected the treaties between them and the British Government. But it never entered my head that this could be a resaon for taking away a part of our territories and annexing it to those territories at a time when every one admits that the peace which those places enjoy is due to God and to us. It is not reasonable that such pressure should be due to suspicion of us or to doubt as to our intentions or our friendship, or to the accusation that we covet a territory which is ours. For the covetous man does not covet a mountain or an inlet ; he covets rather a densely populated country. What we care for is the protection of our honour and the defence of the rights of our subjects and tribes. As to the question of trade, I know that ships call at, and carry goods and all kinds of merchandise to, ports on the Persian Gulf which are less important than mine, and I who count myself the oldest friend of Britain and the greatest of the Arabs am placed at the mercy of Koweit or Bahrain ; and whenever the question is raised, it is said that it is one for the shipping companies. I did not believe that friends could treat each other in such a cruel manner. Praise be to God who granted me and my country more power than that of Koweit, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi, &amp;c. Why should ships call at those places and mine suffer deprivation in that no ships call there ? I hope you will, as you have stated, consider the situation as it is and a veil will be drawn over the past if its mistakes can thus be corrected. Other wise you may inform me of the real reasons. I have summarised in this letter what I have told you at length in my conversation. March 23,1937. (28) Telegram from Sir R. Bullard, Jedda, No. 48, dated the 29th April 1937.

Letter from the British Legation, Jedda, to the Right Hon’ble Anthony Eden, No. 85-E, dated the 2nd May 1937. In continuation of my despatch No. 327 of December 21st last, I have the honour to inform you that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Ltd.) have not as yet been successful in discovering a supply of water adequate for the purposes of the Madh-adh-Dhahab mine. However, they appear to be con fident of ultimate success for they have been accelerating the work on the Jedda “ terminal ”, and also on the jetty which now projects some distanceinto the sea. Moreover a member of the Syndicate’s staff stated in conver sation that Mr. John Park, who holds a watching brief for the operating com pany, has a staff engaged on full pay in the United States of America ready to take over. According to another informant, however, the Sydicate cannot hope to produce gold for some three years yet. No public transactions in shares of the Syndicate have been heard of, but Mr. Twitched says that he has sold some shares “ at a good profit ”. 2. In March a prospector went off to explore the area towards the Transjordan frontier in the vicinity of the Hejaz Railway. He stated before leaving that he would in any case probably find coal, which would suit the company very well. His hopes, however, appear to have been over modest as at the end of April the Legation were credibly informed that the workings of an old mine, rich in ore, had been discovered at Araiq, north of Teima, where a nugget was found yielding seven ounces of gold. 3.

Render, Esqr., Foriegn Office, London, No. E. 3956/ 872/91, dated the 19th July 1937. A gnlo-Italian Relations in the Middle East. Signor Crolla, the Counsellor of the Italian Embassy, called on me this morning and said that he had been instructed by the Italian Government to raise the question of our policy in Arabia as it might affect Italy. As I knew, and as he had told me on February 3rd last, the Italian Government attached the greatest importance to the maint enance of the Rome Understanding of 1927. [S. No. (169) in F. 427 (ll)-N/26.] But since the date of that Understanding there had been many developments. Italy, owing to her conquest of Aby ssinia, occupied a more important position in the Red Sea area, and her interest were more deeply engaged and more widely extended there than they had been before. All that occurred in Arabia was thus of importance to her, and she had become, so to speak, much more “ sensitive ” in this area than in past. The Italian Government had therefore been disturbed by certain recent developments which suggested that His Majesty’s Government might be adopting a more forward policy. 2. Signor Crolla began by alluding to the recent arrival at Jedda of two British aircraft, apparently to bring documents to Sir R. Bullard, and to Sir R. Bullard’s immediately subsequent departure for Riyadh to interview Ibn Saud. He had a long complicated story about reports current in Jedda as to the objects of this visit, which had made the Italian Government very un easy. Apparently realising that this was hardly a sufficient ground for the uneasiness which he had been instructed to express to me, he went on to say— alleging, however, that he did so entirely on his own initiative—that he had read in the “ Daily Herald ” about a month ago that we were extending our authority and influence north of tho Hadhramaut, apparently with a view to establishing ourselves in the hinterland behind the Yemen. His explanations were confused and confusing, but he seemed anxious to suggest that His Majesty’s Government were now adopting a much more forward policy in Arabia, and that Italy, in view of her increased interest in East Africa, could not remain unaffected or indifferent. 3. I began by telling Signor Crolla that it seemed to me increasingly difficult to deal with these constant unjustified suspicions on the part of the Italian Government, in view of the background of hostility and supicion which was being created by the perpetual attacks launched against every thing we did by the Italian press. Hardly a day passed when I did not read in my telegrams of some new and utterly unjustified misrepresentation of our policy and motives in Italian newspapers. This was not my immediate concern, but it made it much more difficult to clear up local questions such as Anglo-Italian relations in Arabia and the Middle East, when one knew that whatever we said or did would be distorted and used against us in Rome. It made one despair of ever getting anything properly straightened out. 4. As regards Arabia, I could tell him at once categorically that we held firmly to the Rome Understanding of 1927 [F. 427 (11) N/26] and that we at tached great importance to its integral maintenance. It was clearly laid down in that Understanding that it was a mutual and important interest both of Italy and of Great Britain that no European Power should establish— 49 •f * itself on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. We had meticulously observed our own part of this Understanding, even to the extent of holding aloof in oases where we might have obtained a dominant position for ourselves in matters connected with Saudi Arabia. I hoped that the Italian Government would be equally scrupulous in keeping to their part of the Understanding, but I felt bound to say that the words and actions of certain Italians had done much to lend colour to the doubts which were felt in certain quarters here as to the ultimate intentions of Italy in regard to the A emen. Our own policy was, however, perfectly clear and simple. We desired to see the independent Arab States remain independent and strong. We had no desire whatever to extend our influence beyond those limited spheres in Arabia in which we were legally entitled to exercise it, and any rumours to the contrary were merely malicious inventions. 5. As regards the particular cases to which Signor Crolla had alluded&gt; I could tell him quite frankly what had been the object of Sir R. Bullard s journey. As Signor Crolla knew, we were faced with an extremely difficult problem in Palestine resulting from our conflicting obligations. The Royal Commission had now produced a Report and recomendations, which might well arouse strong feelings on both sides. We had felt it essential to ensure that the Commission’s Report and recommendations should be clearly under stood by the leading personalities in the Arab world, and that there should be no risk of unnecessary misunderstanding owing to incomplete or inaccurate information. We had therefore decided to send Sir R. Bullard to Riyadh to explain the Report and recommendations of the Commission and the con clusions of His Majesty’s Government thereon frankly and accurately to King Ibn Saud the day before those documents were published in this country. This had involved Sir R. Bullard reaching Riyadh with the Report and con clusions of His Majesty’s Government not later than July 6th, and, seeing that the Report had not been in our hands until the evening of June 22nd, it had not been physically possible to arrange this without sending the necessary documents to him by air. I had myself been responsible for the proposal to send the two aircraft to Jedda, and had only hit upon this way of sending the papers to Sir R. Bullard after I had found that all the other methods of com munication would have been too slow. It was quite possible that Sir R. Bullard might take the opportunity of his visit to Riyadh to discuss any other outstanding matters with the King, but the object of his journey was perfect ly simple and straightforward, and it was absurd to read deep ulterior politi cal motives into it, or to represent it as implying any change of policy on our part. 6. As regards what Signor Crolla had said about our adopting a forward policy in the hinterland of the Hadhramaut and extending our authority round to the back of the Yemen, this was equally off the rails. There had been no question whatever of our extending our authority in this area. The boundaries of the Aden Protectorate dated from before the war, and from the days of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions about Aden of 1905 and 1914. This applied also to the Arab States under British protection on the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf, to which Signor Crolla had made an allusion. The legal boundaries of our sphere of influence both in the case of the Aden Protectorate and in that of our Arab protected States on the Persian Gulf were laid down in the two Anglo-Turkish Conventions of July 29th, 1913 [S. E. Dec. 1903, Nos. 1-245] and March 9th, 1914 [S. E. June 1914, Nos. 71- 115], and the relevant article was Article 3 of the latter Convention, which laid down the so-called blue and violet lines. This Convention had been pub lished in Volume XI of Aitchison’s Treaties (1933 Edition, Volume XI, page 42). The legal position was still governed by it, and as regards the north-west frontier of the Aden Protectorate, the frontier had been confirmed by the Anglo-Yemeni Treaty of 1934 (Gmd 4630), Article 3 of which provided for the maintenance of the existing frontier. There had never been any question whatever of our extending our influence beyond this line, and the last thing we should contemplate doing was to penetrate beyond it and adopt a forward territorial policy in spheres in respect of which we had no legal claim. As regards the Aden Protectorate, which legally extended up to the violet line ” to the north-west, and up to a line running inland from Ras Dharbat50 Ali on the east where it marched with the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, our treaties with the various chiefs and leaders in the northern and eastern areas corresponded exactly to our treaties with the various chiefs and leaders in the south-western district. There was no difference between one part of the Aden Protectorate and another except that we had not in the past exercised any active control over the northern and eastern areas because there was no immediate reason to do so and they were difficult to get at. But now that the hinterland of Nejran etc., was being opened up and the influence of neighbouring Arab States was making itself felt, it was obviously necessary that we should ourselves establish our own authority within our own legal area. This did not imply any change of policy or any new departure. It was°merely an internal measure within a sphere for which we were inter nationally legally responsible. 7. Signor Crolla asked whether we were not negotiating with Ibn Saud over the northern sphere. He alluded to reports of my having carried on negotiations myself with the King on this subject when I visited Arabia last March. I replied that there was no particular secret about the fact that discussions had been going on with Kj.ng Ibn Saud for some time about a possible revision of the blue line frontier. Although this was the legal frontier, it had been fixed at a time when the country was little known, and there were now indications that some of the tribes who wandered to the east of the blue line did in fact come under Ibn Saud’s authority. The area was one of little importance and consisted almost wholly of uninhabited desert. We were therefore not inclined to insist too strongly on the legal line, and conversations had been proceeding in a desultory way with a view to some new line being agreed on. They were for the time being more or less in abeyance, and, as far as we ourselves were concerned, the area which was of most im portance to us was the coastal belt. But, however this might be, the fact remained that legally the whole area to the east and south-east of the blue and violet lines fell within our sphere of influence, and was internationally under our protection, with the exception of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, which was an independent State. Our actions in this area therefore could not possibly be regarded as involving any new policy or any departure from the spirit of the Rome Agreement. 8. I told Signor Crolla that I had given him this full and frank expla nation, as I wished to clear up any risk of misunderstanding and to try to convince him that our policy had not changed, and that we still held firmly to the principle of the Rome Understanding that no European Power should establish itself in independent Arabian territory. But I felt bound to add that the Rome Understanding really seemed hardly applicable to this area, since that Understading specifically referred to the Red Sea and to the Arabian Red Sea coast. The areas under our protection to the south-east and east of the violet and blue lines, which had nothing whatever to do with the Red Sea, therefore hardly seemed to come into the picture. 9. Signor Crolla replied that the Italian Government felt that the Rome Understanding of 1927 ought not to be applied in too narrow or local a spirit. In their view, it was important that there should be a clear understanding about British and Italian interests to cover the whole of Arabia and the Middle East. I asked Signor Crolla whether he meant by this—as he had at one moment seemed to imply—that the Italian Government wanted the Rome Understanding extended or amplified. I was unable to get a definite reply from him to this question, but he continued to say that it ought to be interpreted in the widest possible spirit. 10. Signor Crolla was not easy to follow, as he wrapped his ideas up in complicated language with a mass of allusions and implications, from which he showed great agility in retreating whenever I tried to hold him down on any particular point. My first impression was that he was trying to re present that we had violated the Rome Understanding and that Italy might therefore regard herself as free to adopt a forward policy. He did indeed at one moment hint at something of the kind. When he realised, however, how strong our case was for saying that we had scrupuloulsy observed theRome Understanding ourselves, he rather changed his ground and began, somewhat petulantly, to insist on how unjustified our suspicions were of Italian designs on the Yemen ; he had assured me over and over again, and particularly on February 3rd, in the most categorical terms that Italy had no intention whatever of adopting a forward policy in the Yemen or of violat ing the Rome Understanding. It seemed to him that, if it was a question of unjustified suspicions, our suspicions of Italy were more unjustified and seemed harder to allay than the suspicions which the Italians had entertained against us. I did not pursue this subject further, beyond making it clear that the Italians themselves had done much to shake our own confidence in them. The interview was, however, entirely friendly. 11. At more than one stage in the discussion I made it quite clear that His Majesty’s Government still attached very serious importance indeed to the principle enshrined in the Rome Understanding that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. But in the absence of a final decision of the question whether some public state ment should be made on this point— a question which is still under consi deration—I avoided making any new statement about it which could commit us further than we are committed already.

Letter from British Legation, Jedda, to Foreign Office, No. E 4486/ 27/91, dated THE 29th July 1937. N° te by Sir B. Bullard respecting King Ibn Saud and the Italians. When 1 was at Riyadh Ibn Saud seemed to be more concerned than ?7&lt;f a ^ 0U r r f He referred to M. Mussolini slightingly as the Sword of Islam, but spoke with apprehension about his disposition to interfere in the affairs of other countries—now Abyssinia, now Spain or the Led Sea. He said that according to news from the Yemen the Italians were showing great activity in the Red Sea and had recently landed men on Hanish Island and its neighbour. I reminded the King of what Mr. Rendel had said to him about the Italians and the Red Sea during his visit to Jedda but he was only half reassured. I promised to keep him informed of any Italian move in the Red Sea of which we might become aware. The King said that only two or three nights before, the Italian wireless had again referred to the close interest taken by M. Mussolini in Moslem affairs. He quoted with amusement the neat rebuke administered to M. Mussolini by the Ao-ha Khan when M. Mussolini claimed to be the protector of Islam, but said that in his opinion the Italian propaganda was dangerous. He heard about a year aero that the Grand Mufti of Palestine had accepted Italian help and immediately asked the Mufti whether the story was true. The Mufti said that it was baseless, and that he would tell Ibn Saud the facts when he came on the pilgrimage. When he came to Mecca the Mufti assured Ibn Saud that he was not even in touch with the Italians ; certain people who claimed them selves to be in touch with Italian circles had asked him why he did not accent Italian help but he had refused to have anything to do with the Italians. As for himself, Ibn Saud did not even want to buy rifles from the Italians. k -* . 65 The price at which the Italian rifles were offered had now been reduced to 10s. gold, but he had said that as the rifles he already had were of other makes he did not wish to buy Italian rifles as that would be confusing for his army. (Fuad told me on another occasion that the excuse was not strictly true, as they already had in fact a small number of Italian rifles.) Ibn Saud said that if he took anything from the Italians they would want something in return. In order to elicit his opinions I played devil’s advocate. I said that His Majesty’s, Government were offering a stock of arms at a low price ; would they want something in exchange ? No, said Ibn Saud ; the interests of Saudi Arabia and Great Britain were identical. And would not the Italians allege that their interests were identical with his ? Ibn Saud in dicated that he didn’t care what the'Italians said. When all was said, he declared, the British were the best people. They were better than the Italians, better than the Turks—better than the Arabs. He would even have preferred, from a purely Saudi point of view, that His Majesty’s Government should retain the mandate over Iraq. With the British as his neighbours he felt safe. As an Arab and a Moslem he must sympathise with the advance towards Arab independence, but the independence of Iraq had created a situation which he viewed with grave anxiety. And now the British w^ere going to give up their responsibility for Transjordan ! (42) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. P. Z. 5580/37, dated the 23rd August 1937. Received on 11th September 1937 with Political Secretary' 1 s letter No. 34, dated the 2Gth August 1937. Letter from British Legation, Jedda, to India Office, No. 115 (E. 3720/ 1022/25), dated the 15th June 1937, received 6th July 1937. I have the honour to report the promulgation by the authorities of tw^o measures which appear to be part of the “ Back to Religion T ’ campaign about which I reported in my despatch No. 91 dated the 8th May. 2. The first is an order which was issued by town crier, forbidding all Moslems to shave their beards. The penalty for infringement of this regula tion is a fine of 7 riyals. Any barber who shaves the beard of a Moslem is also liable to a fine. It was understood from the beginning that the em ployees of foreign missions in Jedda w r ould not be interfered with in this respect, but a messenger attached to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company has been fined for a breach of the regulation. It is understood that a considerable sum in fines has been collected in Mecca, but that on at least one occasion the authorities were disappointed by a Javanese who, after being kept in prison and under observation for several days, was still without the rudiments of a beard and had to be discharged unpunished. 3. Most Javanese, in fact, sometimes through natural inability, but often from choice, do not wear beards, and the Netherlands Charge d’Affaires, who is himself a Javanese, recently visited Mecca to investigate this question. He was assured by the authorities that if any foreigners had been punished under the beards regulation it w'as through a misunderstanding, and that if M. Widjojoatmojo heard of the application of the regulation to a Nether lands subject he had only to inform the authorities to have the mistake rectified. This decision is more generous than the regulation itself, which certainly applied to all Moslems, though as it has never been put in writing that cannot ne proved. I may say that no case has been heard of where any British subject has been called upon to comply with the regulation. 4. The regulation on beards is not new, but is merely the re-enactment of a measure which has been allowed to fall into disuse. The renewal of official hostility to shaving is said to be due to Ibn Saud’s annoyance at the discovery of a Saudi youth movement and to his determination to teach its adherents not to be modernising toads. I learn from a good source that there is at least one fact behind the story of the youth movement, viz., the discovery by the Saudi Government that one of the Hejazi students in Egypt was in touch with Salama Musa with a view to the ventilation of Hejazi53 grievances. It is said that the young man was recalled to Mecca, discovered most conveniently writing an incriminating letter, and put in prison. 5. The second measure is a prohibition published by the Ministry of Finance forbidding the importation and sale of what were assumed at first to be statuettes, but turn out to be all representations in three dimensions of any living creature, from a bust of Mustafa Kemal to a Teddy bear. It appears that the measure was prompted by the discovery that some of the children in Mecca had dolls to play with, toy rabbits, and the like. It is true that it is unlawful, according to a well-known Moslem authority, for any Moslem to have an image in his house ; but, according to the same authority, Mahomet cursed all painters of men or animals, yet photography is allowed in the Hejaz. Ibn Saud allows himself to be photographed, and this year a cinema film of the pilgrimage was taken and afterwards shown in Egypt, which could hardly have been taken without the King’s consent. But per haps there is some distinction in the Wahabi tenets between figures in the round and in the flat, which enables the latter to be classed as harmless, or perhaps photographs can be attributed to light and therefore to Allah. 6. There is yet another measure which I hear is to be applied during the forthcoming pilgrim season, though it has not been announced in public. All women pilgrims are to wear complete wrappings such as the Hejaz women ^ wear. Of late years some women pilgrims have been wearing the pre-war Turkish dress (black) of cape, close-fitting hood, and thinnish veil, but this is no longer to be considered adequate. It is not known what action will be taken against recalcitrants, still more against any women who are rash enough to follow the example of those Egyptian ladies who, I am assured, some- times appeared unveiled even in the courtyard of the Mecca mosque this last season. 7. Copies of this despatch are being sent to Cairo, Bagdad and Jerusalem. (43) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. P. Z.-5506/37, dated the 20th August 1937.

Z. 5795/37, dated the 1st September 1937. Received on 26th September 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 36 dated the 9th September 1937. Letter from British Legation, Jedda, to India Office, London, No. 133 (1137/249/8), DATED THE 3rd August 1937. As I have already had the honour to report in my telegram No. 69 of August 1st, the Amir Saud, accompanied by his brother the Amir Muhammad Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, and his suite, returned to Jedda on the 1st August. ’ 2. On the previous evening a printed notice was received by me at a late hour, setting forth the programme of reception ; the ship was due to arrive about 8 a.m. His Royal Highness would be received at the Customs quay, where the diplomatic corps would be looked after by a certain Jamil Davud, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and so forth. I am informed b V some of my colleagues that this was the first occasion on which such a printed notice has been circulated ; but I was evidently fortunate in receiving it the previous evening, as most of the “ corps diplomatique ” did not receive it till the morning of the reception. 3. Mr. Gault and I arrived at the Customs building at 8 A. m. and found a large airy shed, elaborately carpeted and provided with chairs. A broad central passage between two blocks of chairs led up to the seat of honour behind which were about thirty other seats. The Chief of Customs greeted us, and Jamil Davud informed me of my serial number in the diplomatic order of precedence. The diplomatic corps were given seats on one side of the central passage, the other side being reserved for great personages such as the Guardian of the Keys of the Kaaba, the Director of Education the Censor of Morals, and many other persons of note, almost all of whom’ had come to Jedda the previous day. 4. The Amir Feisal arrived soon after 8 a.m. and greeted the diplomatic corps, the introductions being made by Jamil Davud. The Amir sat first m the chair of honour the chairs behind him being allotted to about thirtv members of the Royal family ; I was told that most, but not all, of them were the offspring of King Abdul Aziz. The weather was sultry, and though the customs shed has been well designed to catch any sea breeze which mav be blowing, the diplomatic corps, as well as some of the Arabs, seemed glad to repose in their comfortable chairs and wait for the arrival of the Heir Apna rent. Four aeroplanes circled round at intervals. The crowd included manv picturesque types of Arab ; merchants with their old-fashioned Hei’azi hats young students, fierce soldiers with rifles and full bandoliers, and grave mui- tahids fiom the Holy places all rubbed shoulders, making a many-coloured 5. At about 9-15 a.m. the Amir Saud and his companions arrived at the quay and were escorted to the shed. The Amir Feisal and the other royal personages having greeted the two Amirs very affectionately, all the other Arabs thronged around to salute them, with kisses on the face, or on the hand, or with hand-clasps, according to rank. The Amir Saud behaved with great dignity and charm, and appeared to me to be in excellent health and spirits. Dipidffiatic~corps werepres'ented by the Amir Feisal and Jamil Davud. The Amir Saud shook hands with each. He then took his seat on t ^ e r c 1 . air °. f llonour which the Amir Feisal had vacated, and various addresses of felicitation were read or recited to him. The first was an address of wel come, which contained a reference to the accident which had taken place in Scotland ; the speaker’s congratulations on the Prince’s happy escape evoked a burst of applause. The court poet then came forward and recited a lengthv ode with much vigour and with flashing eyes. I was disappointed to observe that he did not adhere to ancient tradition and recite his poem from memory • he quite openly had his poem written on a paper in his hand, and referred toit before every line. Tbe perspiration poured off his nose and out of his beard as ha worked himself into paroxyms of loyalty, but the drops did not obliterate the writing and he let the audience have 'the full benefit of every word. The heat was not the only thing he had to contend with ; aeroplanes swooping down over the shed with a deafening roar, just missing the roof, drowned his voice ; bursts of clapping in the middle of elegant lines spoiled the effect of the final vowel; but he was deteimined to let us have it all, and repeated, sometimes three times, those parts of the poem which he thought had not been properly heard. After him a little boy, with a squeaky voice, repeated, from memory this time, a long poem of welcome from the school boys of Jedda ; and then an older boy gave us another eloquent address of welcome, ending by a series of what might be called antiphonal responses from his comrades in the assembly. An aged poet from Medina also read a poem, full of eloquence but without so much of the fire which had distinguish ed the previous speakers. 7. The ceremony was now drawing to its close. The Amir Saud address ed a few words to the Diplomatic corps, thanking them for their attendance, and I believe that the dean of the Diplomatic corps, Monsieur Hakim off, the Soviet Minister, replied shortly in suitable terms. The Amir then rose and shook hands with all the members of the Diplomatic Corps in their order of precedence ; and I was able to offer him congratulations in Arabic. He, in reply, said what an excellent time he had passed in the United Kingdom and asked me again to thank all who had been so kind to him. We were then able to depart, and to take off the collars and ties which are so seldom worn here, and which aggravate the unpleasantness of living in a moist heat which has not gone much below 90 degrees Fahrenheit for several days and nights. 8. As we drove back through arches decorated with green and white Mr. Gault told me that he had heard from a member of the French Legation that a demonstration against the Palestine Report had been staged for just after the ceremony of greeting. Nothing of the sort happened, however. 9. I was much impressed by the dignified appearance and bearing of the Amir Saud. It also appeared that everyone was very pleased to see him back ; old inhabitants of Jedda say that all these ceremonies are engineered and ordered by the government; but it really did appear that the people who attended the reception were genuinely glad to see the Heir Apparent return. Much dancing and jollity has been arranged in the streets of Jedda during the past few days ; perhaps Arabs are used to dancing round fires in a moist heat of 90 degrees ; but it seemed to me that everyone w as really quite pleas ed. 10. At 3 p.m. that afternoon I was received by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. I found him attired only in a large white towel; he did not explain this costume until the end of our interview when he said he w^as going to Mecca to perform a ‘ tow r af ’ or circumambulation. He was very agreeable, and repeated how' pleased the Princes had been at their stay in England. I understand that all the returning party left Jedda for Mecca on the evening of the day they arrived.

Italian activities in the Middle East generally have been, and are, engaging the very close and earnest attention of His Majesty s Government, but for the present you may regard the following as the policy which should, in my opinion, be adopted by His Majesty’s Government m the event ot internal disturbance in the Yemen following on the death ot the King. 3. British policy requires that neither the Yemen nor any part of it should fall under the control of any European Power, There is no question of giving encouragement to opponents of the recognised heir ; and in tne event of the death of the King, His Majesty’s Government should recognise Seif el Islam Ahmed as soon as it appears that he is accepted as Imam, but should remain neutral and retain freedom of action if his misrule leads to civil war. In that case His Majesty’s Government should reach an undci- standing wdth the de facto ruler of the Yemeni provinces adjoining the Aden Protectorate and of Hodeidah, and should endeavour to counteract other foreign influences in these districts.

There is, however, anchorage water at the north-west side of the head of the Gidf, and it would be possible to build a breakwater for protection from southerly winds and to make a port there between Aqaba and the Egyptian Frontier wiiich could form a port of outlet to the Red Sea for the Arab and Jewish States in the event of Aqaba being ceded to Ibn Saud. A copy of Chart No. 3595, showing the anchorage and breakwater proposed, is attached.

With reference to my secret despatch of May 28th last regarding Italian activities in the Yemen and connected matter, I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a memorandum which has been prepared by Captain ih W. Seager, the Frontier Officer, who returned to Aden from San’a on August 6th last after a month’s stay in the Yemen. Enclosure to S. No. (55). Memorandum by Captain B. W. Seager, the Frontier Officer, daied the 20th July 1937. During my stay in San’a this month I find that I have not collected very much fresh data to amplify my reports submitted towards the end of 1936. The following represents the results of my observations and the information imparted to me by the various personalities I have met in this town and on my way to and from the Yemen. 2. General .—The question of the succession to the Imam ate still interests all classes. The Crown Prince’s stock is rising and I begin to have very little doubt that he will succeed his father in the first instance. Apart from theWazirs, he seems to fear the rivalry of his brother Ali most of all. The latter is still in prison and will remain there if the Crown Prince has his way though he would prefer to see him dead. It is reliably reported that an attempt was actually made to poison him recently. Doctor Petrie was called in to attend him and told me that he had treated him for dysentery in the first instance but that he reacted too early to this treatment which led him to believe that his internal disorders were not due to disease but probably to poison. He is kept shackled and in chains and although permission was sought to get these removed while he w r as ill, the King would not hear of it. I have met Ali twice in the past. He is a pleasant young man and popular with all. He is said to have a following who would risk a lot to get him out of prison but I fancy he will be lucky to emerge alive unless the Crown Prince has his wings clipped. 3. The Crown Prince has mended his ways slightly but his natural indo- lence coupled with his extreme harshness and cruelty still make him an un popular figure. He is greatly feared and this may stand him in good stead after his father’s death as the electoral body will probably prefer to nominate him rather than incur his wrath. 4. I believe he thinks he is cutting a fine figure in the public eye and there is no doubt that he tries to stir himself into greater activity ; but in mentality he combines the graces ot an impulsive blundering with the vindictiveness and unreasonable cruelty of an oriental despot of the good old davs. Recently, for instance, he imprisoned a soldier for desertion and ordered that he was to die of starvation. At the end of his tether this un fortunate wretch managed to shoot himself with a rifle belonging to one of the sentries. In any other country in the world the Crown Prince would have been torn limb from limb years ago, but here in San’a we live in the year 1200. 5. I was unfortunately unable to see him on my present visit as he was suffering with stomachic pains probably due to over indulgence.The King is fit enough but looks tired : he has aged a lot since I saw him in October Tast. He is in full possession of his faculties and still attends to the minutest affairs of State. It would be useful to eite an example of this During my audience on July 17th last we were interrupted by the entrance of the Prime Minister who sought authority to order an official car ? 'fn „ fira(ye f or the King’s 13th son. This authority was granted and he was told to address a note in this sense to the Director of Motor Trans port The King suspended our audience while he watched Qadhi Abdullah draft the note: when it was completed he was shown the draft which he slightly amended, initialled, and, as is usual in this country, throw on to the floor for action. 7 The Wazir family are still an element to be considered in the matter of the succession but as the Crown Prince increases his influence and makes his uosition felt in the Zeidi highlands—and there is no doubt that he is doing so-so much must the Wazir “star wane. Seyyid Ali bn El Wazrr, the Go vernor of Taiz district has not been in the Zeidi highlands for 14 years and itnmllv out of touch with the highlander whose memory is always a shoit o 8 ne Sey^d lbdiiUah ibn El Wazlr, Governor of Hodeidah in his turn Slirnds most of his time in the Tihama and also lacks contact with the Zeidi element who prefer faces and deeds, how-ever unwelcome, to memories and „„ t ex „loits. Seyyid Muhammad ibn El Wazir, Governor of Dhamar, is a line looking Governor but little political importance can be attached to him. I believe the Wazirs fancy that they have much more influence with t, • Shafef tribes than they actually do in fact. The Governor of Taiz, foi Sstlnce once told me that he was perfectly well assured of his Shafeis loyalty mstai , , , t it now In any ev ent when the-present King dies I do bU t Hrnffit that the Yemeni Shafei tribes on the Taiz border will be restive and give us trouble whether or not the present Governor of Taiz directs their movements into dehberate aggression against our tribesmen. 8. Italian Activities in the Yemen. I have n0 J n | 0r SabbLi° the r,nrt regarding Italian activities in this country. Doctor E. Dubbiosi, the . P , T+nUrm activities in this country, returned from leave only r^Tfs ago S who left the country ihout a month ago, and Doctor Cicconi, an alleged high jumper of mterna- a -k i fn conic vears ago who was in private practice at Trinidad two tional repu f nT 7i • j ’ interim period they appear to have been content'to 'act mereWs* paymasters to the^r agents In 1 is country. It is content to act u y sh ortly as Doctor Dubbiosi has doubtless arrived with fresh instructions and it would have been interesting to o ser\e whether any new form of renewed activities were envisaged. Q Doctor Cicconi who speaks English quite well, told Petrie that he . , vi with Dubbiosi as the latter is a reserved taciturn creature SSrSpSft g™ ; -d U , .bo., town who likes his innocent little parties and recreations. irv rrUr.

He lives in one ot the most secluded parts in San’a in a house which would be an ideal centre for the visits of agents. He is a native of Florence where his family own vineyards. In age he is about 50, speaks Arabic and indifferent French : has worked for years in Mogadiscio. . Messrs. Lazzerinis’agent in San’a.

During my three weeks’ stay in the Yemen I heard no one hint at or mention the Italian bogey ; and my contacts were comprehensive in the capital and on my way to and fro. I could explain the present atmosphere in this connection more clearly by saying that if an official unaware of the political situation in the Red Sea was to have visited San’a instead of myself and had been charged to report on the general political situation after a three weeks study, he would surely have heard nothing from officials, notables, merchants or tribesmen about the Italians, let alone their intentions unless he had asked them pointed questions. This has surprised me considerably and I have to confess that it is difficult to account for it. I could venture a theory that as the “ Italian menace ” to this country has not materialised following a two year period when such a contingency was the topic of tho day, the Yemenis, with typical oriental casualness and inherent natural desire to let unpleasant things slide wffien these do not rear up and goggle at them, have subconsciously relegated the “ menace ” to the background. If something tangible under this head does take shape it will be the front page again, but why, in their way of thinking, should good time be wasted by kicking against the pricks when these pricks do not appear to prick. As I constantly emphasise the unexpected nature of things in this peculiar country I do not dare to push my theory any further. In any event it fits in with the present atmosphere : and I venture to say as much as this with reserve. As it will be seen further on I have not yet had the opportunity of speaking to the Governor of Taiz w ho might raise the question of the Italians and their activities in this country. If he does so I wull report separately in due course. 12. Though it is irrelevant here it is w r orthy of record to state that the Yemeni intelligentsia appear to be very interested in the Spanish war which they follow closely. They all fear that circumstances may arise there which will start a general war. 13. Personalities. — (a) Seif El Islam Hussein .—I have heard no talk in this country of this son’s chances for the Imamate although he cannot be ruled out as a candidate. The King considers him to be his most learned and pious son and I understand that this pillar of purity does all he can to foster his father’s belief. The Crown Prince does not seem to have his knife into him, at present anyhow, and this in itself indicates that he considers him no rival: an intrigue to get him into trouble on his return from London or an attempt to poison him w 7 ould be a healthy sign and show that his stock w T as rising. Hussein would be acceptable to the Wazirs and this should be borne in mind. He saw quite a lot of them on his way to Europe via Hodeida and Taiz. and, as he cannot help intriguing, it would not be a far-fetched guess to assume that the future w as discussed in detail. In the course of a conversation I had with Raghib a few days ago I sought to sound him about Hussein’s stay in London. He w T as vague and said that the King himself had only heard three times from him by telegraph. He assured me categorically that no instructions had been given him or tele graphed to him regarding the making of representations in London in any matter or matters other than that of the Palestinians. This is interesting. It is true that the King has his own peculiar little ways of usurping his Foreign Minister’s functions without consulting him but I should be much surprised if he had instructed his son to make any representations in a foreign capital without Raghib’s knowledge. I must aver that on receipt of a recent Foreign Offfceaespatcnconcerning Mussems' talks at the Foreign Office T w^as sur prised to note that he had touched on the question of British representation in the Yemen. I assumed at once that he had acted on his own initiative, and, if Raghib is to be believed, my assumption was correct. In the matter of the selection of the Yemeni Coronation Mission, Raghib told me that in the first instance he had been commanded to head the Corona- nation Mission and he had accepted with alacrity. Later the King decided that a son of his should head the Mission and that Raghib should proceed as second delegate. When Raghib heard that the son was to be Seif El Islam Hussein he managed, with the greatest difficulty, to back out on the grounds of ill health. Such a deadlock was reached apparently that the King told Raghib that if he did not proceed he would send no Mission ; but as the AdenGovernment had already been informed in writing that a Mission would pro ceed, Hussein was eventually instructed to leave without the Foreign Minis- tsr. Ihe latter told me that he had suffered at Hussein’s hands in the past in the matter of his arrogance and autocratic behaviour. I could not help remarking that I had only met this princeling in 1937 and that I could agree that he was arrogant and autocratic. At my audience with the King on July 17th last he asked me after his “ boy Hussein ”. I replied that when I last saw him he appeared to be in rude health. It appears that he has informed his father that he is suffering from anaemia and that he is consulting specialists in London. (b) Qadhi Abdullah El Amri .—The Prime Minister is as powerful as ever and is still the King’s most trusted adviser. He is much disturbed about the succession and constantly prays for the King’s long life. In this he is sincere as his own future is very uncertain after King Yahya’s death. In his reference to the Crown Prince he is careful not to criticise him but prays that Allah may guide him and equip him for rulership which implies that at present he is no fit person to rule ; this is the general view and I share it. The Prime Minister is quite certain in his own mind that the Crown Prince will succeed in the first instance and makes no secret about it. Qadhi Abdullah’s relations with Raghib have worsened—if that were possible—and though outwardly they are the best of friends their one desire is to oust the other. Qadhi Abdullah is more charitable than Raghib and merely refers to him as a tiresome old man. (c) Qadhi Muhammad Raghib Bey .—During my stay here this month I have noticed that Raghib, like the King, has aged considerably since October 1936. He finds it more difficult to grasp matters of detail and sometimes has to repeat words to himself before they sink in. He is, I think, over 70 years of age and his thirteen years in this capital without change have worn him down. At the moment he and the Prime Minister are engaged in under ground warfare to such an extent that Raghib is obsessed with it. The vast amount of intrigue in this town and the sinister interpretations attributed to the most innocent acts sometimes lead me to wonder whether I have stumbled on a vast mental institution. It surpasses the bounds of all normal human understanding. As part of my time here is spent listening patiently to stories about the sinister machinations of this person and that, I have to hear a donkey bray or a dog bark before I am brought back to a sense of reality. Raghib suffers from this form of hysteria to a marked extent. I am quite convinced that he would do anything and sacrifice every, thing to get out of this country at the earliest opportunity. His relations with all Yemenis are most unhappy but the King will not let him go even if he spurns him and treats him abominably at times. In spite of this, how ever, I believe that he is secretly flattered by the King’s refusal to release him and I do not doubt that this alone makes life endurable to him. {d) Seyyid Abdullah ibn El Wazir .—The Governor of Hodeida still seems to carry his anti-Christian bias to an extreme. He has recently much embarrassed our political clerk in Hodeida and told him quite openly that he would be as difficult and as uncompromising as he could with any person who served the Christians. Mr. Salih Jafar deserves commendation for his tact and self-possession as his patience has been sorely tried. Seyyid Abdullah for all his outward show of dignity and grandeur is a chicken-hearted 'poseur. I am quite sure that, like his cousin in Taiz, he is piqued at the Aden Govern ment’s apparent disrega rd of the importance^ of the Wa zirs while he knows that we want no quarrel with the Yemeni Government and its officials. In the circumstances he feels that he is safe enough to vent his spleen on and derive malicious pleasure in baiting Mr. Salih Jafar who is wise enough to remain unruffled. It is clear that he is acting deliberately and for a set pur pose and his anti-Christian pose serves the object in view. Like his cousin in Taiz, but in a different manner, I think he strives to make it emerge that Wazirs can be a nuisance if they are not placated. Seyyid Abdullah met his cousin, the Governor of Taiz, in April last. T hese two had not met for fifteen years or more and it is not difficult to guess that they discussed future Waziri policy in all its aspects. Before this meet ing it was reported that their relations had not been of the most cordial and I suppose that this has now been remedied. 69(C) ExAffainDept69 I am inclined to recommend that however mischievous the Waziris can be it would be politic to continue to keep them at a distance particularly as there is now little doubt that the Crown Prince will succeed his father. His reign may be a short one and a disastrous one but he may find time to twist the tails of the Wazirs before he lays down the reins of office or is bumped off the throne. If he cannot do so and if the Wazirs prove too strong for him there will be time enough to reconsider our policy in regard to them. I have not yet been able to determine what attaches the Wazirs have with the Italians but I believe that they would come on bended knee to the Aden Government before they approached the Italians seriously. However this country is a peculiar one and it is dangerous to anticipate events. I have heard little or nothing on my present visit regarding Seyyid Abdullah’s bid for the Imamate. His relations with the Crown Prince are as bad as ever and I do not think that there is any chance of improvement. The Crown Prince is well aware of the Wazir’s aspirations and his watch on them is relentless as it is menacing.

(As the overland route was flooded I could not return via Taiz.) 14. The Army. —It is reliably reported that the King is endeavouring to introduce a system of conscription in this country. His idea is to institute a period of four months with the colours and that on the expiry of this period the trained reservists will be released but not before fresh batches arrive in San’a to replace them. So far the experiment has not proved successful as only about 1,600 tribesmen have been enrolled. I understand the tribes are suspicious and fear that once their tribesmen have been enrolled they will not be released. The powerful Hashid tribe has so far stood out against any form of conscription and the King is negotiat ing with them now. 15. For the training of the conscripts the King has engaged the services of Hassan Tahsin Pasha who claims to have been G. O. C. of the Hejazi troops in Jedda during the Saudi-Hejazi war. The Pasha called on me during my present visit. He claims to have been a divisional commander in the Turkish Army during the war and says he is 58 years of age. He is either older than he claims to be or was not a divisional commander during the Great War. In any event he is full of enthusiasm about his task and states that he has excellent material in the Zeidr tribesmen for whom the conscription system has been introduced. I did not like to damp his ardour but I fear he has a heart breaking task. (56) Enclosure in Colonial Office letter No. P. Z. 6555/37, dated the 4th October 1937.

Record of Mr. Salih Jafar’s conversations with certain Yemeni OFFICIALS ON HIS RETURN JOURNEY TO HODEIDA FROM ADEN (AUGUST 6th —9th). On his return journey to Hodeida Mr. Salih Jafar visited Seyyid Ali ibn El Wazir, Governor-General of the Taiz district. Seyyid Ali told Mr. Salih Jafar that an Italian Mission, headed by the Governor of Asmara, was expected to proceed to the Yemen in September in order to open pourparlers for the renewal of the I talo-Yemeni treaty. Syyid Ali remarked that the Mission was expected to ask for concessions in the Yemen. 2. At Haiss in the Yemeni Tihama Mr. Salih Jafar had talks with Sheikh Ali Muhammad Noman (a non-Zeidi) the Amil (Governor) of Haiss. Sheikh Ali told Mr. Salih Jafar that Seyyid Ali ibn El Wazir (the Governor General of the Taiz district) was a bitter enemy of the Noman family. He added that a complaint had been lodged by the family of the late Ali Pasha of Udain against Seyyid Ali for the misappropriation of about two-thirds of their property valued at about 100,000 dollars ; and that a letter from Seyyid Ali to his San’a agent had been intercepted and was now in the hands of Sheikh Abdul Wahab Noman (the uncle of the Haiss Amil) in which the true facts of the Ali Pasha case were revealed. The intercepted letter also contained statements derogatory to the Yemeni Government. Sheikh Ali said that this letter was to be handed to Seif El Islam Ahmed, the Crown Prince, in San’a. Mr. Salih Jafar was further informed that Seif El Islam Ahmed had recently required the personal attendance in San’a of Seyyid Ali to answer the charges brought against him by the Ali Pasha family but that the King had not allowed the issue of the summons. This had much upset the Crown Prince. According to Sheikh Ali Muhammad Noman, the Governor General of Taiz is disliked by the Shafei tribesmen in the Taiz district. 3. Mr. Salih Jafar arrived at Zabid in the Yemeni Tihama on the even ing of August 8th and stayed the night as the guest of Sheikh Ali ibn Hamud of Kaukaban the Amil (Governor) of Zabid who is one of the many claimants to the Imamate. He informed Mr. Salih Jafar that when he had left San’a he had been given a document (apparently that reported in paragraph 6479 of the Aden Political Intelligence Summary) and was asked not only to sign it but also to obtain the signatures of the leading personalities in the Zeidi highlands and in the Tihama in which the signatories signified their willing ness to the proclamation of Seif El Islam Ahmed as Crown Prince and as King after the death of King Yahya. Seyyid Ali said that he had succeeded in collecting the signatures of all the parties concerned (? including that of the Wazirs). 4. Seyyid Ali remarked that if after the death of King Yahya, Seif El Islam Ahmed failed as a ruler and the Yemen decided to have a King (and thus abolished the Imamate) Seyyid Ali ibn El W T azir (Governor General of the Taiz district) would, in his opinion, have the majority of the people be hind him ; but that in the event of the continuance of the Imamate, Seyyid Abdullah ibn El Wazir (cousin of Seyyid Ali ibn El Wazir) the Governor of Hodeida or another personality (meaning himself) might well be elected. 5. Seyyid Ali concluded his conversation by saying that he hoped that the British Government would stop foreign interference in the Yemen and help to maintain its independence.

Enclosure in Air Mail letter No. 42, dated the 20th October 1937, from Secre tary, Political and Secret Department, India Office. Letter from British Legation, Jedda, to India Office, London, No. 149 (1353/384/340), dated the 13th September 1937. In continuation of my telegram No. 77 of September 13th I have the honour to forward to you herewith a copy of the original Arabic text and a71 translation of the note-verbale which His Royal Highness the Amir Faisal sent to me on September 12th under cover of a personal note asking me to communicate it to you as soon as possible. 2. I have done my best with the rather obscurely-worded text. The two parts of the translation about which I have the greatest doubt are the part dealing with the delay in Sheikh Kamil el Qassab’s arrival and depar ture, and the last sentence. The former is not of great importance. As for the latter, I suspect that there is a misprint and what the King really meant was that the promoters of the conference contented themselves with making as few arrangements as possible, in deference to His Majesty’s disapproval of the whole idea of the conference. 3. The general meaning is I think clear. Ibn Saud is anxious to show His Majesty’s Government that he continues to do nothing contrary to their policy, and that in pursuance of that aim he is not afraid to stand up to Iraqi and Syrian extremists. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch with enclosures to His Majesty’s Representatives at Cairo (No. 1354/384/340), Bagdad, (No. 1356/384/340) and the Officer Administering the Government of . Palestine at Jerusalem (No. 1355/384/340). Enclosure to S. No. (57). Enclosure to Jedda despatch No. 149 (1353/384/340) of 13th September 1937. Note Verbale. H. M. the King has read Mr. Eden’s reply to the royal message which I communicated to you on the 19th Jumad-ath-Thani 1356 (August 26th 1937), and I have to say that H. M. the King wishes to make it clear to the British Government that Sheikh Kamil el Qassab left here convinced that there would be no need to convene a general Arab conference as he had pre viously intended : but owing to a delay which resulted in his not arriving in Syria at the time which he had originally fixed for his return, persons who were desirous of holding the conference had without delay issued invitations for the 8th day of September : and that persons from Iraq who shared their interest in the conference had already agreed to convene the conference. The conveners of the conference have therefore apologised to us saying that though they approved of our idea, and wished to comply with our desire, the arrangements which were made had already progressed so far that it would have been impolitic to change them entirely. They were therefore content to make as few arrangements as possible. (58) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. P. Z. 6601/37, dated the 6th October 1937. Received on 30th October 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 41, dated the 14th October 1937. (Notes by G. W. Rendel, dated the 29th September 1937.) Signor Crolla, the Counsellor of the Italian Embassy, raised this question with me again on September 27tT! Me said tha'The had at firsT thought of sending in a formal note on the subject, but that the Italian Government did not wish a formal written communication to be made at this stage in advance of the proposed Rome Conversations. He had, however, been authorised to explain their views in a preliminary and informal way, and he suggested that perhaps the best plan would be for him to do this orally and for us to have an agreed record of the conversation. 2. I replied that this seemed to me open to any objections. An agreed record would be an even more formal and committing document than a written note and would need very carefully working out. I added that while I should be very glad to hear anything he had to say I doubted whether there was really much advanatge in discussing the matter further until we knewrather more about what was likely to happen over the proposed general con versations in Rome. If these conversations took place, it might be conve nient, just before they started, to have a talk about the piesent cpiestion , but if they were for any reason delayed, I doubted whether much would be gained by a preliminary discussion at this end of this particular question in isolation. 3. Signor Crolla then said that he thought perhaps the best thing to do would be to show me the draft of an informal communication which he had prepared, stating the Italian point of view. This was a kind oi aide memoire, in Italian onlv, which he said he could not leave with me but wnich iie won id like me to read. 4. I went through this document with him. Its main thesis was that the Rome Understanding of 1927 applied not only to the Red Sea area but to Southern Arabia as a whole. It represented that it was an essential prin ciple of the Rome Understanding that the status quo existing at the time ol its signature should not be modified except by agreement and in consulta tion with the Italian Government. The Italian Government at that time had known nothing of our claims over what we now called the northern and eastern areas of the Aden Protectorate, i.e. the Hadramaut, Shehr, Mokalla, etc., and they could only regard our new “ forward policy in this area which in their view had the effect of adding some 40,000 square miles to the Aden Protectorate—as an annexation of territory in violation of the Rome Understanding. This contention was supported in the draft by a number of extremely flimsy arguments, several of which I was able to controvert immediately, though Signor Crolla naturally professed not to be convinced. The draft aide memoire was accompanied by a draft annex giving specific instances of our alleged forward policy. 5. I told Signor Crolla that it was obvious from the text of the Rome Understanding itself that that Understanding was not intended to refer to any of the areas in Arabia which were under our protection. Had it been intended to deal with this part of Arabia those areas would, of course, have been mentioned. But there was no mention even of the Aden Protectorate in the agreement, although the existence of the Protectorate and our interest in it was of course well known and generally accepted at the time. I presum ed that the Italian Government were not trying to challenge our position at Aden, although the argument developed in Signor Crolla’s draft could be read as an attempt to do so. 6. Signor Crolla admitted that the Rome Understanding could not be regarded as in any way interfering with our rights in the Aden Protectorate, but he repeated that'the Protectorate, as then understood by the Italian Government, was a much smaller area than what we now claimed, and again urged, in support of this contention, that it had always been so shown on ad published maps etc. Seeing an atlas on my table, he suggested^ that we should look it up in proof of his contention. The atlas was Stieler s Hand- atlas, 1921 edition, and contained an excellent map of Arabia, on which, to Signor Crolla’s discomfiture, practically the w r hole of the southern coast of Arabia turned out to be marked red, as a British possession. (This was a piece of luck, for I fear that Signor Crolla is on stronger ground on this parti cular point even than he thinks, since there are many old official publica tions—including, I believe, India Office and Colonial Office lists desci ibing the Protectorate as a very much smaller area than what w r e now claim.) Signor Crolla again emphasised that what the Italians complained of was not our established rights in the Aden Protectorate but what he described as our attempt to extend the boundaries of the Protectorate for something hire 50d miles to the east and for a great distance into the hinterland. 7. I explained to Signor Crolla that there had been no change whatever in the political situation. Our sphere, as I had explained to him before, was bounded by the Anglo-Turkish boundaries of 1914. There had never been the slightest question of our extending our influence beyond that sphere, which had been our sphere since long before the War. But within it we had always claimed special rights. Our position in the south eastern corner of the Aden Protectorate rested on a number of ancient treaties with the local chiefs. Identical treaties existed with the chiefs in the area now being brought under closer administrative control. Whatever arbitrary distinc tion unofficial maps might have shown between the south western and the73 north eastern areas of the Protectorate, the fact remained that legally there had been no difference between these areas. The fact that we had always regarded the whole area as falling within our sphere was obvious from the fact that it was we who had negotiated the boundary with the Turks. There would have been no point in our negotiating with the Turks about this unless we had had some claim over the territory on our side of the line. 8. As regards the Rome Understanding of 1927, I was convinced that its negotiators had never intended to deal with anything but the Red Sea area. This seemed to me clear from the text, where the words “ Southern Arabia were obviously only loosely used to cover the hinterland of Asir. The Rome Understanding did not in any way imply that we claimed no rights in Arabia. We had always claimed to exercise a form of protectorate over a number of Arabian states, especially on the Truciat coast and at Bahrein and Koweit. Our rights over the Hadramaut, as part of the Aden Protec torate, were of precisely the same character. 9. Finally, Signor Crolla said that he had been instructed to suggest that “ owing to the difference of opinion between the British and Italian Gov ernments ’ as to the interpretation of the Rome Understanding on this point, H. M. G. should suspend all the various measures now being taken, such as the despatch of a Resident to Mokalla, and the raising of local levies in the Hadramaut, pending the clarification of the issue. 10. I replied to this that I would note what he had said but that I did not see how we could possibly accede to this request, since we regarded the measures in question as a purely internal matter affecting the administration of territory under British protection, and not affected by the Rome Under standing in any way. The territorial status quo in Arabia was not affected. 11. Eventually, it was agreed that Signor Crolla should write me a private letter embodying, with some slight modifications, the text of the draft aide memoire he had shown me. He showed some reluctance to do this, but I thought it best to ask him to put what he had said in writing as we may as well know the worst, and it may be useful to have the Italian arguments in their own words, in order that we may begin considering the best way of answering them. 12. I think we can only await Signor Crolla’s letter, but it looks as though the Italians were working up a somewhat tiresome case about this, and as though we might have a good deal of trouble with them before w'e have done. (59) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated the 7th October 1937. Received on 30th October 1937 with Political Secretary'’s letter No. 41, dated’ the 14th October 1937. Notes by G. W. Rendel, dated the 27th September 1937. Copy No E 5648/306/91. Signor Crolla, the Counsellor of the Italian Embassy, told me this after noon that he had been instructed to ascertain whether we were yet in a posi tion to reply to the representations he had made to Mr. Baggallay in August about the title of the British Civil Administrator in Kamaran. He repeated tnaf flTe Italian GoveiTmmnfnaa been' disturbed to see thatthe“ regente ” of the quarantine station was now described as Civil Administrator. This seemed to imply a degree of authority—and indeed a claim to sovereigntv— incompatible with the provision laid down in the Rome Understanding that “no European Power should establish itself on Kamaran”, and the Italian Government hoped that we would take steps to have this title al tered. 2. I told Signor Crolla that I thought the Italian Government were under a misapprehension. While we had been extremely scrupulous in loyally observing our undertaking not to claim any kind of sovereignty in Kamaran, we had, as he knew, always carried on the necessary minimum of administra tion in the island. Since we were responsible for the quarantine station'rnmggmBmmmmmmmm m 74 as the great majority of pilgrims were British subjects, it was obviously necessary to make sure that the rest of the island was reasonably well manag ed, and this involved a certain degree of administration, policeing, etc But we exercised these functions in precisely the same provisional way as we managed the quarantine station, and there was absolutely no question of their involving any sort of claim to sovereignty. Indeed, I had good reason to know that we had carefully refrained on many occasions from taking action—e.gr. embarking on any development of the island—which might have looked as though we were trying to peg out a claim or dig ourselves in. 3. As regards the title of Civil Administrator, this title had been used ever since we had been in the island, and certainly long before the time of the Rome Conversations. I confirmed, through Mr. Grey of the Library, that as long ago as May, 1926, the British official responsible for the administra tion of the island was officially known as the Civil Administrator. 4. The point I emphasised to Signor Crolla was that there had been no change at all since the time of the Rome Conversations, and that nothincr whatever had been done to alter the status of the island. 5. Signor Crolla seemed slightly shaken by this explanation, which he promised to report to his Government. GiPl&gt; - 59(C) EjiAfiairsDo^t—S2 17-8-38- -2.5.120 (65) Enclosure in Colonial Office covering letter No. P.Z.-4922|37, dated the 26th July 1937. (Received on 15th Auyust 1037, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 230, dated 29th July 1937.) Lettek from Goverxor, Aden, to Secretary of State for Colonies, London, No. Secret-2, dated the 30th June 1937. With reference to my Secret despatch of the 26th May 1937, on the subject of the extension of Italian influence on the Eed Sea Littoral and in Aden Pro tectorate territory, 1 have the honour to inform you that about three weeks ago persistent rumours were in circulation that an Italian warship had sent ashore agents in the Subeihi country, to the west of Aden, and that these agents had distributed arms and money to certain inhabitants of that district. It was not possible to obtain any definite or circumstantial reports regarding these inci dents, but in view of the persistence of the rumours, it seemed desirable that investigations should be conducted as to their accuracy. 2. On the 18th of June therefore I sent the Second Political Officer, Captain the Honourable K. A. B. Hamilton, to the Subeihi country, and between that date and June the 25th, he visited five different centres in the area concerned while a dhow acfing under his orders visited Perim and Sheikh Sa’id. 3. As a result of his investigation, Captain Hamilton has come to the con clusion that within the last two months the Italians have turned their attention to the deep anchorage that lies to the west of Ras al Ara on the coast between Aden and Peiim. He further thinks that they have established some sort of communi cation with the shore ; there were repeated references by the local Arabs to “ a white-painted steamer ” which had approached the land, and to a vessel described as a submarine that had been seen on several occasions near the shore. 4. It seems possible that the Italians may have explored, in submarines, the Ras-al-Ara anchorage ; and it is averred that during the last two months Italian submarines have frequently been seen between Ras-al-Ara and Bir Saqeiya. 1 inally, it is reported that Italian agents have visited Saqeiya and another village in the vicinity and have lectured the people on the weakness of Britain and the strength of Italy. 5. \ ou will, no doubt, appreciate the extreme difficulty of establishing the truth or falsehood of such reports ; for naturally, as soon as it is known that investigations to that end are being made, it is hard to find anyone who will admit to any knowledge which might connect him with the subversive activities of a ioreign power. But, while I am satisfied that no “ gun-running ”, or distri bution of money on a large scale has recently taken place within the Protecto rate, I am nevertheless forced to the conclusion that Italian agents have, of late, been active in the Subeihi country. 6. This attempt to introduce Italian influence into the Arabian mainland adjacent to Sheikh Said would be in keeping with the suspected Italian design of securing control of both coasts of the southern Red Sea, and of thereby gaining command of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandab, in the furtherance of which project Italy is believed recently to have fortified Dumeira and Rsheita on the African shore opposite Perim. i. At this stage I desire merely to acquaint you with the situation as it has presented itself to me, and to state that I am considering what steps should be taken locally to counteract these activities. At present, I am examining the possibility of adopting two complementary measures ; the establishment in the Subeihi country of posts from which reliable information could be collected and reported and the urging of His Highness the Sultan of Lahej to take a more iuiiive inleresi in a thorough surveillance ot the Subeihi country. 8. I propose shortly to submit to you a further report with my recom mendations for dealing with the situation. Enclosure 1 to Serial No. (65). Demi-official letter from B. R.

E. ilio Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, and of my reply LS109EADr I, — 121 Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (65). Letter from British Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, c\o H. M. Naval Office, Colombo, to Governor, Aden, No. E.I.-3464, dated the 5th June 1937. I have the honour to refer to the recent messages exchanged between Your Excellency and myself on the subject of a possible visit to Easht Island by H. M. S. “ Norfolk ” or H. M. S. “ Weston ” to investigate a reported landing of Italians. • I wish to take this opportunity of assuring Your Excellency that neither my message to yourself (times 2302 of 26th May) nor to H. M. S. “ Norfolk ” were intended in any way to deprive you of the use of that ship should you have personally considered it desirable. I was under the impression, however, that this suggestion emanated from the Commanding Officer of H. M. S. “ Norfolk ”, as 1 was not of the same opinion as the latter, firstly as to the safety of a ship of that size in badly chartered waters, and secondly with regard to the effect on other countries, of the visit of an 8-inch Gun Cruiser to waters which would naturally be thought out of the ordinary and be apt to arouse curiosity and cause comment. On the other hand, the visit of a Sloop to such waters would be a normal occurrence and likely to pass unnoticed. The landing of Italians on various Islands in the Red Sea has been con- stantlj reported, and with one exception only these reports have proved entirely I do understand, however, that some Italians have been prospecting for oil m the Sarafan and other Islands, and I have even heard it rumoured that they have asked permission to prospect in Kamaran Island and its vicinity. I am not, however, so seriously concerned about the above information, as I am ot the fact that Italians have engaged a large number of Yemeni subjects during the last year for service in Eritrea as labourers, or possibly even, accord ing to some reports, as soldiers. . Apparently the Italians send these labourers back to Hodeida periodically r with ample sums of money, and engage others in their place. It is surely unreasonable to engage labourers for such short periods, if effiicient labour is what the Italians require ; on the other hand, if their inten tion is to influence the natives of the Yemen for other purposes, this is precisely the action needed. In any case the Italians appear to find plenty of money to pay them. ^ ^ j The Political aspect of this matter is hardly within my province, but should my premise be correct, and the process of educational propaganda continue. I ieel that under certain conditions an Italian Yemen would be easy to brimr about. . . I have no doubt that in that case the balance might be rectified by the oddo- sition of Saudi Arabia. lour excellent Political Officers, with judicious agents, could doubtless ascertain the nature of the teachings given in Eritrea to these Yemeni labourers, with their reactions thereto, and I feel sure that such information would be of considerable value. Ihese are matters which it is quite impossible for a Sloop, or its officers, to* deal with and which I consider to be of prior importance to the possible occupa tion by the Italians of an Island from which they might be evicted. The Red Sea Sloops have orders to keep in close touch with you, and I hope you will ’not hesitate to makeTsuch use of them as you may consider desirable with a view to elucidating the state of affairs. They are free to make out their own cruise programmes which are subject only to the concurrence of the Admi ralty and myself, and in peace time I see no reason why they should not be used as you may require. I attach for your information a copy of a Naval Appreciation of the Red Sea situation which I recently forwarded to the Admiralty. In view of its most secret nature perhaps Your Excellency may consider it desirable to destroy it after perusal.i 122 I much regret that I have so far not had the opportunity of meeting Your Excellency as you were home on leave during all the time I was at Aden. I am looking forward however to hearing your views on the matters discussed in this letter. S .—The latest Naval Intelligence, just received, indicates that during the period 1st September 1936 to 6th May 1937, approximately 3,525 Yemeni subjects went to Eritrea on enlistment by the Italians as labourers, and that of these approximately 1,168 returned to the Yemen bringing back with them a total sum estimated at about 1,690,962 lire. Enclosure 3 to Serial No. (65). Letter from Governor, Aden, to His Excellency the Naval Commander-in- Ohief, East Indies Station, Colombo, No. C.-689, dated the ]9th June 1937. I have the honour to refer to Your Excellency’s secret and personal letter No. E.L-3464 LEnclosure 2 to Serial No. (65) j, dated 5th June 1937, and to thank you for the assistance that you offer in the use of Ked Sea Sloops in dealing with the developments of the situation in southern Ked Sea and in the neighbourhood of Aden. There is no doubt that the Italians are endeavouring to forward their interests in the Yemen by every means available short of direct and open inter vention. Their propaganda work in the Yemen, and especially in the coastal Tihama, is increasingly active, and the frequent rumours of their occupation of islands in the Ked Sea are a sign of the general apprehension that prevails. The engagement of Yemenis a? labourers and sometimes as soldiers, to which you refer, is one of the methods that they adopt to increase their influence. Unfortunately it is not within our power to stop it. The recruitment of Arabs from southern Arabia for Italian Colonial Force is a practice of long standing which commenced before the Great War and has continued at intervals since that time. It has been increased since the autumn of 1935 owing firstly to the Abyssinian war and more recently to the need for labour for carrying out the extensive works of development that Italy is undertaking at Massawa, Assab and other places in her East African possessions. * The Italians offer good wages which appeal to the inhabitants of poor countries such as the Yemen and also the Aden Protectorate. Arabs coming back from Italian employment frequently bring stories of ill-treatment, but they are generally prepared to undergo this for the sake of their financial gain. Incidentally a good deal of the money that they bring with them is smuggled, as the Italian authorities have forbidden ihe export of lire. 2. I do not think that the short periods for which the labourers work are altogether the result of Italian design. It is customary for such labourers to work for a comparatively short time and to return to their families with the money earned, and in this respect the Italians allow them to follow their incli nations. The Yemen is an independent State, and it is not possible for us to prevent this labour recruitment, nor would it in any way add to British popu larity in southern Arabia if we were to debar its people from taking advantage of an opportunity of making money. It is this desire to make money that is the dominating motive with these people and although the Italians no doubt wish to extend their influence through them, the reports that they bring are by no means always favourable. 3. We have recenly had reports of the appearance of vessels, suspected of being Italian, off the coast imme diately to the ea st of Perim and within the limits of the Aden Protectorate. It is thought that these ships may have been sending munitions into the southern Yemen bj^ this route. I have sent a Political Officer to the district to make further enquiries and H. M. S. “ Londonderry ” intends to watch this coast when she is in the neighbourhood. 4. I realise that some of the stories that reach us may be exaggerated or untrue, but I nevertheless feel that there is increasing evidence of Italian designs to obtaining control of both coasts of the southern Red Sea and to establish themselves in the Yemen.

Letter from British Consulate Benghazi, Libya, to Foreign Office, No. 12 (339|21|37), dated the (5th December 1937. In conjunction with my Saving Telegram No. 6, I have the honour to submit the following Memorandum :— Programme of the Pan Arab Movement. The Movement aspires to create an Arab Empire consisting of all the Arab people living in the East and South of the Mediterranean, in the East, and also in that great part of the country west of the Red Sea, known as Arabia. These people are connected by religion, language and history, and at the same time are closely related. These Arabians are divided into three groups according to geographical situation, and progress as follows :— Group A. Eastern Arabia :—Egypt, Syria, Palestine, Transjordan, Lebanon and Iraq. Group B. Arabia :—(Saudi Arabia) Hejaz, Yemen. Group C. Magrib (West) :—Libya, Tunis, Algiers and Morocco. Aims and Object. To obtain complete Independence for all Arab countries, and unite them into one great Arab Empire. 1. The people of Grop A, have been granted, or have either entered the first phase ot independence, or have contracted treaties with other Governments (Palestine to be settled within Federation). 2. The people of Group B, now have complete independence. 3. The people of Group C, cannot be included at present, but it is the aim to do so after the Federation of Groups A and B, and when the time is propitious. Constitution. 1. Owing to its strategic position, and development, Egypt is proposed as the head of the Federation, and there Congress will be held. 2. Federal Taxes, and Finance, 3. Federal Military Force.124 4. Federal Education. 5. Federal Posts and Telegraphs. 6. Federal Customs, with no interstate Customs. 7. Federal Diplomatic and Consular Service. 8. Unity of Islamic Rules. 9.

Telegram from His Majesty’s Consul (Benghazi), to Foreign Office, No. 6 (sic) -Saving, dated the 6th December 1937. My despatch No. 12 outlines what is said to be programme of pan-Arab move ment agreed to for Dumsheikh conference, as reported to me by the proprietor of Djezireh, Arab journal of Damascus, and publisher of the ^ book Falastin Eddamieh, named Zabian Kailani, who is on his way to visit Mussolini ostensibly as a journalist, but who implies that he is on a mission on behalf of Husseini recently Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, regarding question of Italian help for Arabs He added that Husseini requires [funds] (?) and is waiting to know how Italy will help and what Mussolini will do about Libya to implement his promise He expressed [? grp omtd.] possibility of Fascist-Arabic Pact, in character of anti- feoviet II act] (?), and believes that change of Minister of Colonies of Italian Ainca has special significance. He states that Italy still supplies aeroplanes arms and ammunition to the Yemen, and that besides Syrians many from I ale si me and the Yemen aie being trained as air pilots in Italy. He emphasises that Arab leaders prefer British friendship but are prepared [turn to] (?) any one who will assist them to retain Palestine, which they consider their Holv Land. He says Egyptian journals Ahram, Mokattam, Misri, and Bala&lt;di are subsidised by Italian Embassy in that country.

( 68 ) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. P.Z.-8414j37, dated 29th December 1937. (Received on 23rd January 1938, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 1, dated 6th January 1938.) Telegram from Sir R. Bullard (Jedda), to Foreign Office, No. 98, dated the 15th December 1937. Speaking of Palestine today Ibn Saud spoke with anxiety of his own situation. He had always considered the maintenance of position of His Majesty’s Government as essential to his own and Zionism had brought them into great peril. He spoke of Italy with his usual fear and distrust. I notice whereas in March the waving of the sword of Islam by Mussolini amused him, he said today that it was astounding to what extent Mussolini in spite of his well-known ill-treatment of Arabs in Libya had been accepted by Arabs as their champion. 2. That Ibn Saud should worry about his own fate in case of collapse of His Majesty’s Government is an indication that he would not help to embarrass them (except as I think in case of difficulties of war when prizes that could be offered him would be very tempting) but it is also proof that his fears for effect of Palestine policy on His Majesty’s Government are genuine. I represented partition of some kind as offering hope of final solution but he considers that125 existence of a separate Jewish State would be a most dangerous irritant. But he evidently cannot believe His Majesty’s Government will carry partition through. He referred seriously to rumours that they were already considering alternative schemes including one where His Majesty’s Government would stop [grp. undec.] and hand Palestine over to Iraq who would then throw Palestine open to unrestricted immigration by the Jews. I described this as fantastic and said that partition scheme remained the policy of His Majesty’s Government though no one could say that recommendations of the Commission to be appointed in this connexion would be. 3. Ibn Saud evidently has a minor anxiety lest His Majesty’s Government should adopt some alternative scheme without consulting him. In fact he said that he trusted His Majesty’s Government would always communicate to him as early as possible any important information about their Palestine policy. I reminded him that they had always repaid his frankness and said I was confident they would continue to do so.

On the termination of the Great War people commenced to interest themselves in the evolution of the Arabs of the Levant, and Islamic people in general. Italy has taken special interest in the future of the Near East. 188 (S) ExASaireDept.The present arabic disorders and manifestations against the Jews at Yemen, Iraq, and on the Palestinian frontier, is causing Great Britain some anxiety. The unsuccessful treaty of 1927 between Ibn Saud, and the British Government, has disturbed the peace between the Arabs of the Levant, and the British. The death of Sir Gilbert Clayton in 1929 was a great loss to England. The breaking of the ‘‘Treaty of Friendship” of 1929, between England and the new King of Mecca has created a very grave issue in the East and Ibn Saud considers it will lead to a Holy War, which, should it develop, will have a great reaction on the British Colonial Empire. The Arab insurrection will not be confined to these small states^ the re percussions of the Arab dispute are being felt by all the Mussulmans of the world. The history of the Arabs in the East records, in bloody pages, the horrors of the conflict with England, and the struggle in Palestine cannot teave J aly indifferent, who, being an acknowledged great Mussulman power .will lollow events closely. 1 Italy reminds all Mussulmans of the new Roman Empire, and its pres tige as a great World and Mediterranean power.

The local editor of the Berid Barca has written to his correspondent II Kondi, in Syria, inquiring into the political situation in Palestine. The reply received was that the Arabs in general are still suffering terribly, because, the Jews have taken away their land, and that also England is against us (the arabs).

At this meeting there were also pre sent all the Muftis of Tripolitania, who sent a petition to the Governor General of Libya, with the request that it be forwarded to the Duce. The contents of this petition were as follows: — “We Mussulmans of Tripolitania, and the whole of Libya, are ready to join our brothers in Palestine, for better or for worst, and placing our trust in God, we hope they may obtain their full rights, and wishes. We feel that our brothers in Palestine, are suffering owing to the pro posed partitioning of the land of our forefathers. We Mussalmans of Libya submit to you, Duce, a strong protest against England, who has stood in the way of the Arabs, sucked our blood, and taken our money. Is all this not enough? No! she has also taken the Holyland, dividing it into portions amongst our enemies the Jews; consequently we are very hurt. During the Great War it was agreed that we were to be given help and freedom, but now it is the contrary, so much so, that now England has turn ed against us. Beloved Duce, we want your help, such as you have promised us in your speeches many times. Now you know our opposition to ignorant England, we leave everything in your hands, so that Italy may give us a helping hand and we are always ready to take your orders as before. England versus the rights of the Mussulmans. The British Government returned to Palestine, and sent out all the Mussalmans! England wishes to act against the word of God ! If the Mussalmans leave Palestine, the British Government should hand over England, because centuries ago it was part of the Roman Empire, and also8 Spain to the Mussalmans, It was the Arabs and not the Jews who helped England to take Neapolis. Who was it who destroyed the Railway lin during the Great War? it was not the Jews, but the Aiabs. We sent away the Turks from Palestine, with the intention that we should be allowed to stay there. We have helped England also m the taking of Aleppo, and we Mussulmans are upset because England has given the best part of the country to the Jews, leaving the other to the Arabs.

As the period of one year mentioned in article 9 of the Saudi “In- structions concerning Traffic in Slaves” (sent to you in my despatch No. 278 of the 6th October, 1936), expired on the 2nd October last, this Legation has since that date been endeavouring, by discreet enquiries, to ascertain what the exact position is. I have the honour to report the following information, which is intended to complete that contained in my despatch No. 102 of the 24th May last. I must emphasise, however, that the indirect enquiries which I have caused to be made have been quite unofficial, so that the resulting information, though I believe it to be correct, must be regard ed with reserve. 2. Nothing has been heard of any six-monthly report on the lines of article 14, nor of any supplementary observations of the Inspector of Slave Affairs (who, it wil be remembered, is the Director-General of Police at Mecca). It is not laid down, however, that such reports should be pub lished. 3. Certain licences have been issued to slave-brokers in accordance with article 12. Two brokers, named Hassan Amudi and Muhammad-bin-Seif, say that they obtained licences from the Jedda police authorities against the payment of £1 gold per licence. 4. One or two slaves only have been registered at Jedda. But the Jedda brokers say that a large number of slaves have been registered at Mecca.5. Mr. Ousman, pro-consul at this Legation, who was employed at Riyadh during this summer, reports that there were a large number of slaves at the capital. He did not hear anything said about their having been registered. ( 6 ) (Received on 29th January 1938, with Political Secretary's letter No. 2 y dated the 13th January 1938.)

Important* Your telegram No. 119 of December 31st. 1 saw Ibn Saud in camp near Ashaira at 8-30 a.m. on January 4th and handed him an aide-memoire in the sense of your telegram No. 117. 2. After examination of text in private and long discussion Ibn Saud said he was inclined to optimism. But this is obviously based on his belief that in the long run His Majesty’s Government cannot decide partition to be either just or practicable. Moreover the optimism is tempered by his fear that atmosphere in Palestine is unfavourable to the work of proposed com mission. The publication of despatch would help but would not be enough. Many Palestinians were in exile or in prison and outrages were reported daily. Suggestion by Fuad that a general amnesty might be granted imme diately he ruled out as not practical politics. Perhaps the severity of the sentences of military courts might be diminished for a beginning and some thing in the nature of an amnesty might be worked up to if guarantees and co-operation were assured. I believe he is already considering what he can do to help to create a better atmosphere. 3. Ibn Saud again spoke with the greatest solemnity of peril of position of His Majesty's Government and consequently of his own. The fire in Palestine was small but the wind of intrigue was blowing the flame straight at the living tree. Not only was he anxious on political grounds but the Palestine business was infinitely distressing to him personally. For four months he had been unable to listen to broadcasts from Jerusalem because they were so painful to him. He had decided to listen on January 3rd to the first Arabic broadcast from London and filled his tent with Arabs for the occasion. When the news was announced that an Arab had been execut ed in Palestine he felt as though the rope was round his own neck and he and the Arabs with him could not refrain from tears. At this His Majesty was deeply moved and tears in the sincerity of which I at least believe came into his eyes. He readily admitted that the British did not punish Arabs for 188(S) ExAffairoDep'their political opinions but asked whether the crimes for which they were hanging and imprisoning Arabs would have been committed if it had not l&gt;een for the policy of His Majesty’s Government. I know a reply of a kind to this question but none that will convince Ibn Saud or anv other Arab. J 4. Despatch by bag today.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated the 18th January 1938. [E.-7587/351/65.] Letter from Sir R. Bullard, to Mr. Eden.—(Received December 29), (No. 177), DATED THE 29TH DECEMBER 1937. Jedda, December 7, 1937. It appears that certain Arabic newspapers in Egypt published a tale, which has been reproduced in the Syrian and Iraqi press, alleging that Ibn Saud, out of deference to the feelings of Great Britain, had refused to aUow a general Arab congress to be held in Mecca, and that if he persisted in this refusal a congress would probably be held in some other Arab country. I have the honour to inform you that the Umm-al-Qura of the 3rd December denies this report in an article, which is to the following effect: — 2. This report is entirely without foundation. No application for such a congress was ever made by any person or body of persons. It would not be unreasonable to say that such an application was made and rejected (though, in fact, nothing of the kind happened), but it is fantastic to sug- gest that the application could be rejected out of deference to the wishes ot the British. The rumour must have been intended to discourage and divide the Arabs at the very moment when they feel the need for concord and unity. Its author must know that the Government of His Majesty is not a negligible force and that the person of His Majesty is the centre of the circle of Arab countries and the symbol of Arab aims, and that conse quently the dissemination of false news about Flis Majesty must profit the enemies of the Arabs and of Islam. Every keen Arab and Moslem should know the truth, that the King is not moved by caprice or covetousness • he is tke man of the Arabs, conscious of his racial and religious duty and devotinu himself and his possessions to the promotion of the truth and the faith He does not like self-advertisement or propaganda. He never embarks upon any matter affecting the interests of Arabs or Moslem interests unless he is sure that he will not have to draw back unsuccessful. He has experience of the world and knows the harm of futile demonstrations. The Govern ment and the people of Saudi Arabia naturally attach the greatest import ance to the Palestine question, not from any personal ambition but because it is an Arab and a Moslem question. It is fitting that an Arab Shara r Moslem Government and a country where the divine inspiration was reveal ed and Islam originated should take anxious thought for all matters ing the Arabs and the Moslems in all the territories which they inhabit On the other hand it is fitting that the country which contains the two Holy Sanctuaries and is based on piety and divine worship alone should be left tn itself in such matters and safeguarded from suspicion, so that the will of God alone may be done.

I am sure that His Majesty’s Government will remember Ibn Saud’s suspicion of Iraqi government who, he considers, tried to usurp first place in Palestine negotiations and in discussions with Yamen and will not give Nuri justification for claiming third special position in London in regard to discussions which he says are to take place there.

Translation of memorandum on Palestine by Ibn Saud will be sent by next bag. It has an annex showing why he considers partition neither just nor practicable. 2. Memorandum contains much that His Majesty’s Government have heard before about Anglo-Arab interests, peril of foreign intrigues, suspi cion of Arabs about Jewish ambitions and so on. Ibn Saud is, he says, much distressed about what he calls policy of severity and was about to send His Majesty’s Government a communication on that subject when despatch of December 23rd brought a ray of hope. He is prepared to do his best to induce Palestinians to put their case before new commission but feels unable to do this until His Majesty’s Government have done something to improve the atmosphere, since he advised the people of Palestine once and they were disappointed, and moreover their fears have been justified by hopes andambitions published by Jews. He does not presume to advise His Majesty s Government but suggests their consideration as preliminary steps : (i) Stoppage of Jewish immigration until final solution is adopted or at least for two years. (ii) Prohibition of sale of land for same period. (iii) Preliminary steps towards restoration of normal conditions by diminishing severity of military courts, permitting return of exiles and deportees, pardoning persons imprisoned politically or administratively, and inviting all to co-operate with the new commission. 3. I send this without comment since His Majesty’s Government have all information required for estimate of its value. Similarly they know what I do not know, viz : whether we need help or can struggle out of Palestine marsh unaided.

Legation have received from reliable informant Arab pamphlet about “Atrocities of British colonisation in martyred Palestine’’. Pamphlet pur ports to have been published by Central Committee in Iraq for Liberation of Palestine but informant says that it was printed in Beirut and that large numbers were brought to Jedda on orders of Mufti by well-known Palesti nians who propose to distribute copies during pilgrimage and to raise funds for their cause. 2. Pamphlet which will be sent Jerusalem by first opportunity has article on “Martyr” Farhan, photograph of torn Koran alleged to have been damaged in attack on Moslem house by British police led by Jewish officer, and so on. Ibn Saud discourages distribution of political propaganda but private distribution cannot be prevented and you will realise that suppres sion of such material as this which has a sub-stratum of truth and deals with a subject on which Moslem feeling runs high is difficult and [2 grs. omit.] sought. Existence of these pamphlets must soon become known to Ibn Saud but if I can warn him about them without giving my informant away I will.

Bullard, to Mr. Eden.—(Received January 11, 1938), (No. 181), dated Jedda, December, 18, 1937. I have had the honour to report to you by telegram on various ques tions raised in an interview which I had with Ibn Sand on the Ihth Decem ber, during a visit of forty-eight hours which he paid to Jedda. I now give a summary of the whole of the conversation. 2. His Majesty began, quite unexpectedly, with Iraq. He was wor ried at the instability and what might be called lack of continuity there. The Cabinet was divided and resignations were threatened, and some of the tribes were still hostile. I talked of the difficulties which naturally beset a country in the first stages of self-government, and said that in any case I should be surprised to hear that Saudi Arabia had any ground of complaint against the Iraq Government. Ibn Saud said that that was true. Even in the time of Hikmet Sulaiman (though he seemed relieved that that regime had come to an end) he could not say that the attitude of the Iraq Govern ment had been anything but correct towards himeslf and Saudi Arabia, but he felt that he never knew what W’ould happen there next. For instance, there were people there who were bringing forward schemes for Palestine, not from love of Palestine or of the Arabs, nor from friendship towards His Majesty’s Government, but from personal ambition. I concluded that he was referring to the project of Nuri Pasha’s, which is mentioned in Bagdad telegram No. 261 of the 13th Decemebr, and which formed the subject of Mr. Kelly’s despatch, of wdiich a copy was sent to me under cover of your despatch No. 369, dated the 30th September, 1937, and this impression was confirmed when the King mentioned a scheme which Nuri Pasha had explained to Sheikh Hafiz Wahba in Egypt some time ago; but, as will be seen later, Ibn Saud had also heard of another palestine scheme affecting Iraq. I sent a telegram to the Foreign Office on this point, No. 97, dated the 16th December. 3. The King then spoke of the Italians, of whom he seemned to be no less suspicious than he was when he talked to Mr. Rendel and myself in March. They were always interfering, now in one country, now in another. Look at the Yemen! After the publication of the Italo-Yemeni Treaty not long ago, he wrote to the Imam and asked whether there was anything behind what was published. The Imam assured him that there was nothing, and he believed the Imam, who was a clever, wide-awake man; but he would not answer for the Imam’s sons, nor for the Yemeni officials. 4. The next subject was arms. Ibn Saud said that, as His Majesty’s Government knew, he had tried to treat the Italian offer of arms in such a way as not to place himself under an obligation by acceptance and yet not to offend the Italians. The offer of Italian rifles he had eventually refused, ES^S,, ExAffairsDept14 &gt; on the ground that his forces were equipped with Mausers, and that to in troduce some weapons of a new type would complicate the rearmament ques tion. The Italians then said that they would get him any kind of rifles he liked, e.q., Mausers from Austria or Germany. The King then pleaded poverty, but the Italians said that that need not worry him, they would arrange easy terms. Keeping to his delaying tactics, the King said that if they would provide samples he would study the matter; and there the matter rested for the moment. Had he done right? What would His Majesty’s Government say? I repeated more or less what Sheikh Hafiz Wahba had already heard at the Foreign Office. His Majesty’s Government had pro vided all the arms which their own urgent needs enabled them to spare. If it had been within their power they would gladly have supplied more, but it was not. Ibn Baud was the sole judge of his own requirements in the matter of arms. It would evidently be better if he could have recourse to neutral supplies rather than to a Government like the Italian, which presumably, as His Majesty had himself said, was not offering cheap arms out of pure love for Saudi Arabia, but if in the end he could not escape the Italian offer, he would at least be acting with his eyes open. Ibn Saud said that he would continue to delay as far as he could, but there usually came a time in such cases where a decision could no longer be postponed. However, he would see what he could do. 5. I mention here that, according to a statement which Fuad Hamza had made to me the day before, the Italians wanted to sell Italian guns and anti-aircraft guns, in fact, any war material Ibn Saud might want as well as Mauser rifles. 6. Passing then to aviation, Ibn Saud said that he much wanted to get rid of the Italians. He realised that to replace them by British or French might create an awkward situation, but replacement by Moslems would not be open to the same objection. Could His Majesty’s Government suggest some suitable nian from Egypt or Iraq for this purpose? I asked whether what His Majesty wanted was a trained air-force man to take charge of Saudi aviation, and after some talk His Majesty explained that he would like a sort of chief of staff to advise on all arms, and that, failing that, he would be glad to have an expert to take charge of aviation. I promised to report this desire to His Majesty’s Government at once, and I have done so in my telegram No. 99, dated the 16th December. From the tenor of the conversation, I assume that Ibn Saud would apply to the Government con cerned for the loan of a suitable expert if he could first have the advice of His Majesty’s Government as to the character and capacity of some possible candidates. I could see objections to the proposal, and felt sceptical as to the advantage, other than the elimination of the Italians, which Ibn Saud might expect to obtain if it were carried out; but we have had to blow cold upon so many Saudi aviation schemes that I did not want to be discouraging about this one at the outset, the more so as there is nothing to prevent the King’s applying to Egypt or Iraq without consulting us, in which case some quite unsuitable person might be sent here. 7. No reference was made by Ibn Saud to the alleged offer of a Soviet air mission (your despatch No. 413, dated the 1st November). This did not surprise me, for when I had mentioned the subject to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin the day before, he had expressed ignorance and surprise, and after making enquiry had told me that no such offer had been made and that Sheikh Hafiz must have misunderstood something much vaguer as to which he would get the papers from Mecca. I have no more information on this point at pre sent, but it seems clear that there is no question of the acceptance of a Soviet air mission by Ibn Saud. 8. The King then talked at length about Palestine. The views he expressed were summarised in my telegram No. 98, dated the 16th Decem ber. He was not violent, or even reproachful, but very anxious about his own position as being dependent on that of His Majesty’s Government. He said more than once, as he has said before, that while he objected to thepartition scheme as an Arab and a Moslem, he objected to it also because he felt it would be ruinous to His Majesty’s Government and therefore dangerous to himself. At one point he said he would rather that the British mandate should last for another century. I employed the familiar argu ments in favour of partition, especially the one which has always appealed to me personally (provided that frontier less unfavourable to Arabs than those suggested in the report of the Royal Commission could be found), that a limitation by territory would be more stable and more likely to be final than a limitation by population, but the King said that, on the contrary, he believed that the creation of a separate Jewish State would be a perpetual irritant and source of danger. But, indeed, he seemed unable to believe that partition would ever be effected. 9. The King asked whether I had seen the reply which he had caused to be given to the accusation that out of deference to the feelings of His Majesty’s Government he had refused to allow an Arab conference to be held in Mecca. I said that I had seen it in the Umm-al-Qura (see my des patch No. 177, dated the 7th December), and that it seemed, if I might say so, to have been drafted with His Majesty’s usual wisdom. Ibn Baud said that in spite of the denial there was something in the report. It had been suggested that there should be a secret conference about Palestine in Mecca, but he had refused to allow it, alleging that Mecca was a place for religious worship, not for political conferences. That was, in fact, one of his reasons, but. of course, he had others; he never embarked upon any policy until he was sure it was reasonable, and he did not wish to embarrass His Majesty’s Government. And besides, if the holding of a conference had been the course to pursue, he would have proposed it himself and not fol lowed the suggestions of others. 10. Here the King revealed again a secondary anxiety, viz., that His Majesty’s Government would come to some arrangement about Palestine with someone else in the Arab world, or come to some fresh decision without his knowledge, and thus damage his prestige irretrievably. There was, he said, a story going about to which many were giving credence, that His Majesty’s Government proposed to declare a cessation of Jewish immigra tion into Palestine and to hand the country over to the Iraq Government, who would then, as part of the bargain, open Palestine to unrestricted im migration by Jews. He said that he had always been frank with His Majesty’s Government, and he hoped they would always be frank with him. I described the scheme he had mentioned as fantastic in itself and incredible for two other reasons. In the first place partition was still the declared policy of His Majesty’s Government, though, of course, no one could foresee what the recommendations of the forthcoming commission would be, and in the second, His Majesty’s Government appreciated the complete frankness and sincerity with which His Majesty had always acted in the matter of Palestine, and I was sure they would never take any serious deci sion on the subject without giving him the earliest possible notice. 11. Ibn Baud said he wished that some policy could be found which would not place His Majesty’s Government in opposition to the Arabs. The one question of Palestine apart, the interests of His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Arabs were identical, but the Arabs found themselves facing the Jews, whom they could easily deal with as Jews alone, and behind the Jews they found the British, and conflict was inevitable. The Arabs knew well and execrated the treatment of the Arabs in Libya by the Italians both before and after the war, and no one could have believed a year ago to what extent Mussolini would induce the Arabs to look upon him as their cham pion. His success was entirely due to the British policy in Palestine. 12. At the time of the interview I had not received the instructions con veyed in your telegram No. 110, dated the 15th December, which arrived after Ibn^Saud had left Jedda, but, as will be seen from what I have said, I anticipated your assurance that there was nothing fresh to say, and that, if there was, he would be told as soon as possible. I also anticipated your16 message about the necessity for mutual comprehension of each other’s diffi culties by the two Governments. I asked His Majesty whether he had not found, as he rose from being ruler of Riyadh to his present high position, that at every stage the points of contact with the world increased and poli tical questions became more complicated, and when the King said that this was so, I asked whether he could not believe that the affairs of Great Britain, coming as she did into touch with many countries which did not concern Saudi Arabia seriously and having possessions all over the world, were even more complicated than His Majesty’s. Ibn Sand pondered a moment as though the matter had not struck him in that light before and said that he agreed, and I hope that the argument helped to convince him of the truth of my assurance, that it was not from failure to give careful attention to his proposals that His Majesty’s Government had not been able to decide upon a policy more satisfactory from his point of view. 13. The matters other than politics which were touched upon at the interview are dealt with in my despatch No. 182, dated the 18th December. Throughout the interview Ibn Saud showed the friendliness and desire to co-operate with His Majesty’s Government which were shown during the talks in March last when Mr. Rendel was here. 14. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan, His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Cairo and Bagdad, His Excellency the Governor of Aden and the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. (15) Memo, from His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, No. 218/271/'3, dated the 30th January 1938. Presents his compliments to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, New Delhi, and has the honour to transmit to him the undermentioned documents. Description of Enclosure. To Foreign Office, despatch No. 17 of 30th January 1938 and enclo sure. Law relating to converts to Islam. Letter from H M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 17 (217/271/3), dated the 30th January 1938. I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a law which appeared in the “Umm-al-Qura” of January 21st, 1938, prescribing the formalities to be fulfilled by any recent convert to Islam who wishes to visit either Mecca or Medina. There is to be set up a religious committee in Jedda with authority to examine such persons and any documents which they may produce in support of their claims, and to issue a decree, where the conversion is adjudged to be genuine, which will authorise the convert to proceed to the Holy Cities. 2. As you are aware, there have been several cases during the last few years where persons claiming to have been converted to Islam have been detained in Jedda for considerable periods while their claims were being examined, and at least one case, that of Mrs. Sterling, an American lady (Jedda Report for February 1936 paragraph 76) permission to proceed to Mecca was eventually refused. Article 4 of the law reserves to the Saudi Arabian Government “the absolute right to refuse permission to enter the two sanctuaries to any person suspected of political, military or other julteiior] aims’’, and even were this provision wanting, no religious com mittee would issue a decree involving authorisation to enter Mecca without■■■I ■ /r V 17 instructions from the King. Suspicion is chiefly directed against those persons who profess Islam in order to be able to visit a forbidden city, either out of love of novelty or from a desire to secure notoriety, and this suspicion will now have been strengthened by the appearance of a book enti tled “Triumphant Pilgrimage” and the discussion which it has aroused. This book, which is written by Owen Rutter, purports to give an account of the visit to Mecca of a British subject born in the United Kingdom who appears under the name of “Chale”. The real name of this man is McBryan, and his appearance in Jedda and his admission to Mecca at the last moment were chronicled in the Jedda Reports in 1936 (January para graph 36, 'February paragraph 76). From reviews which have appeared and from information obtained from Sarawak, where Mr. McBryan was formerly employed and whence he set out on his pilgrimage, it is evident that much of the story as related by him through Owen Rutter is untrue and that his religious professions, albeit supported by circumcision with a flint, are open to suspicion. 3. It is unlikely that the new law will make any practical change in regard to recent converts. They will still be regarded with suspicion and will have to satisfy the King before being allowed to enter either Mecca or Medina. But the fact that they will not be allowed to perform the pilgrimage as a matter of course is now laid down by law, so that recent converts may be aware before they set out upon the journey to the Hejaz of the conditions which they will have to fulfil. 4. Copies of this despatch are being sent to India and Singapore. Enclosure to Jedda, despatch No. 17 (217/271/3) of 30th January 1938, Extract from the Mecca “Umm-ul-Qura”, No. 685 of January 21st, 1938. A Law Concerning Converts to Islam, and Their Entry into the two Sanctuaries. An ordinance has been promulgated ratifying this law, and ordering its enforcement. Article I. —Any recent convert to Islam shall, on his arrival at Jedda for the performance of Umra or the visit to Medina, present to the reli gious committee in Jedda documents supporting his claim. Article II. —Any recent convert to Islam who wishes to enter either of the two sanctuaries shall submit to the religious committee appointed by the Government at Jedda certificates legalised by the authorities before whom he adopted the Moslem faith. Article III. —Any recent convert to Islam, who possesses certificates legalised by a high Moslem committee which is recognised in other Moslem countries, or attested by any of the great Moslem Ulama (learned men) known to the Government, shall be entitled to enter the two sanctuaries after the legalisation of his certificates by the religious committee in Jedda. Article IV. —The application of any recent convert to Islam, who does not possess the certificates mentioned in the preceding article, shall be dealt with by the religious committee, and he shall remain in Jedda for a period of fifteen days on probation; and if his claim is found to be true and his (belief in) Islam established he shall be permitted to enter the two sanc tuaries after obtaining a decree from the Sharia Court at Jedda, in accord ance with the provisions of the preceding article, to the effect that he has adopted the Islamic faiths Article V. —The religious committee at Jedda which shall have the right to examine the certificates of converts to Islam and to examine any convert to Islam who is not in possession of a certificate shall be composed of the following persons:— 1. The President of the Sharia Court at Jedda. 188(S) ExAffairsDept.2. The President of the Committee of Virtue. 3. One of those Ulama whom the Government may think fit for this purpose. 4. The Government of His Majesty the King shall have the absolute right to refuse permission to enter the two sanctuaries to any person suspect ed of political, military or other [ulterior] aims. ( 16 ) Memo, from the India Office, London, No. P. Z.-1155/1938, dated the 20th February 1938. Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Depart ment, India Office. A copy has been sent to the Foreign Secretary, Government of India. [E.-662/662/25.]! Letter from Sir R. Bullard, to Mr. Eden.—(Received February 4), (No. 5), DATED JEDDA, JANUARY 17, 1938. I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a regulation published by the Saudi Government regarding compensation to workmen in “technical industrial concerns.” The regulation is dated the 9th Sep tember, 1937, but it was not published until the 3rd December, though it was communicated to the firms concerned a few days before that date. 2. It is understood that the regulation has been drafted by Najib Salha (Personalities, No. 112) and that he has drawn his material from the com pensation laws of several other countries. The badness of the drafting, which is remarkable even for Saudi laws, is probably the compiler’s own.’ To mention only one instance : An employee who was paid 39^ Saudi rivals a month would escape the definitions in sections 4 and 5, and thus his employer would not be liable in respect of any accident that happened to him in the course of his work. Some of the other points where the drafting is defective are indicated in square brackets. 3. Judged by the standards of this country, the rates of compensation are extraordinarily high, e.g., £450 gold for permanent total disablement of a skilled workman. It is quite right that wealthy foreign companies should pay adequate compensation in such cases, and I am far from sug gesting that the rates, regarded absolutely, are too high; but they are enor mously greater than anything the Saudi Government would pay. More over, it is not certain that the victim or his next-of-kin would receive the full amount paid by the company. This doubt is founded upon the know ledge that the companies to whom this regulation applies are required by the terms of concessions to pay in gold for certain personnel who do not, in fact, receive salary at those rates. For instance, the Petroleum Develop ment (Western Arabia) (Limited) have to pay to the Saudi Government £o00 gold per annum in respect of the supervision of their concession by Najib Salha, and £20 gold per mensem for an “inspector” of very low status who is supposed to watch the drilling on the Farsan Islands. It is to be hoped that the analogy I have drawn is not sound and that the full compensation will go to the victim or his next-of-kin, but a little scepticism is permissible. 4. The provision most open to objection is contained in article 20, which makes the regulation retrospective. It was partly on this account, though also on account of the high rates of compensation, that the Jedda manager of the Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) (Limited) proposed to hisp 19 principals that the regulation should be resisted; they, however, instructed him to take no action. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company, it is believed, have asked their principals for instructions. It is inevitable that in the end all companies concerned will accept the regulation without protest. It is inevitable that this poverty-striken country should try to make money out of the lew foreign concessions in various ways, and it will not pay any of the companies to enter into controversy unless larger sums are at stake than are involved in the application of this regulation. 5 I am sending a copy of this despatch and enclosure to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O. T. 3, 102/215/2). (17) Memorandum from the India Office, London, No. P. Z.-1458/1938, DATED THE 5TH MARCH 1938. Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Depart ment, India Office. A copy has been sent to the Foreign Secretary, Government of India. Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated the 2nd March 1938. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, No. 9, (134/399/7), dated the 19th January 1938. In my telegram No. 23, dated January 17th I had the honour to report a conversation which I had with Ibn Saud after a dinner which he gave on January 15th on the occasion of the visit of Lord Belhaven. As personal relations have considerable weight with Ibn Saud, as with Arabs in general, I think it may be useful to give you an account of this meeting between the King and Lord Belhaven, who is an old acquaintance of his. 2. In the early part of the Great War Lord Belhaven was employed as a Political Officer in Iraq and as Political Agent at Kuwait, and later he was sent on a mission to Ibn Saud. His mission did not last long, as he was superseded by Mr. Philby, but he conceived a great liking and admiration for Ibn Saud, and when the Amirs Saud and Muhammad came to Great Britain for the Coronation he enter tained them for some days. The Amir Saud suggested that Lord Belhaven should visit Saudi Arabia, and being in Aden on his way back from India Lord Belhaven telegraphed to .say that if His Majesty would care to see him he could be in Jedda about January 13th. The King seemed very glad to have the message, and said that he would come down to Shumaisi, some ten miles below Mecca on the Mecca-Jedda road, for a meeting. He pro posed to accommodate Lord Belhaven in a palace near Jedda, but did not insist when I asked to have the pleasure of entertaining Lord Belhaven, who was a colleague of mine in Iraq. Lord Belhaven spent a week with me in Jedda, and on the appointed day we went to Shumaisi to meet His Majesty. 3. On arrival at Shumaisi we were shown to the King’s tent. Lord Belhaven is sixty-six years of age and walks slowly and with difficulty, and20 it added to Ibn Baud’s obvious pleasure at the meeting that a man older than himself and far less active should pay a visit to Jedda in older to see him for an hour—had acted, in fact, as an Arab would do when passing near a friend’s tent. He sat for about half an hour in informal talk. The conversation is not worth recording in detail but it may be mentioned that the King was highly amused when Lord Belhaven, referring to the improve ments in public security and in other respects, said that the King would perhaps one day restore the great dam at Ma’reb—forgetting that Ma’reb is in the Yemen. When Lord Belhaven said that the English were like the Arabs in being lovers of freedom Ibn Baud hastened to explain that the ruler did what he thought right but was under the orders of Allah like anv other Arab. I suggested that the ruler governed according to a religious constitution, and Ibn Baud accepted the phrase as accurate. In the course of this talk the King invited me to stay with him in camp next winter, if there should be normal rain to make the desert worth visiting. 4. After the King had performed the sunset prayers we reassembled for dinner, which was set out on a long table in another tent. The Amir Faisal was banished to the other end of the table with Shaikh Yusuf Yasin and two or three other officials. At the end where the King sat were only Lord al-Kurdi, who admits that his anti-British policy is not that of his master, As a concession to us there were European dishes, but in accordance with the King’s custom all the dishes were on the table at once. One of the important items in the King’s diet was milk, which an armed slave at his elbow held constantly ready in a hideous green and white enamel mug much chipped with long service. 5. Most of the time during dinner the talk was about old times, and especially the time when Lord Belhaven visited Riyadh in 1017. Most of the men Lord Belhaven asked about are dead; “but” said the King, waving towards a massed crowd of retainers, “their sons are probably there”. He then spoke of the heavy casualties in some of his battles with Ibn Rashid, and said that he embarked upon one battle with one hundred and fifty men and came oft' with one camel—his own, and various wounds, one of which left a finger distorted and useless. He said that of the men who helped him to take Riyadh—his first success—only three remained, and he repeated their names and the names of their fathers. G. The dinner did not take very long, and after dinner we sat only for a few minutes, drinking coffee and talking. The King wanted to talk to me (about Palestine) and to hurry to Mecca; Lord Belhaven therefore said goodbye and withdrew. The King said goodbye to him very kindly, and spoke of him after he had gone with great appreciation and affection, as a man “with a sincere heart”. I am sure that he was touched by the visit and the unaffected friendliness of Lord Belhaven’s manner and conversa tion and I believe that the visit was in the narrow sense “useful” to His Majesty’s Government. 7. I could not help contrasting this meeting with the various functions at which I had seen Ibn Baud when Mr. Philby was present. The King talks in a familiar fashion to Mr. Philby and makes genial fun of him, but there is nothing in his manner towards Mr. Philby of that real friend liness and respect which he showed to Lord Belhaven. The fact is, I think, that Ibn Baud is telling the truth when he says that he likes the English (he would I fear include even a Representative Peer for Scotland in this definition), and that the more English they are the better he likes them. It is no recommendation to him to have become a Moslem, to imitate the Arabs hy saying “God prolong your life!” before every remark addressed to the King, or to be wearing sandals when all the other “courtiers” present are in socks and slippers and the King himself is wearing socks with “Pure wool Made in England” on the soles.(Received on the 12th March 1938, with Political Secretary'a letter No. 8, dated the 2Mh February 1938.) P. Z.-1109/38. Enclosure in Foreign Office covering note, dated IGth February, 1938, No. E.-767/196/25. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, No. 8 (124/551/6), dated the 17th January 1938. I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a circular which I have received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, asking the foreign missions not to communicate with any Saudi department except the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. This is presumably the circular about which I tele graphed to you in my telegram No. 12, dated January 10th. It does not however indicate that the object of the circular is the elimination of foreign propaganda by foreign missions, and I therefore despatched my telegram No 19, dated January 13th. Fuad Bey talked at some length about this circular in a conversation which I had' with him a few days ago, and I understood from what he said that the Saudi Government would refer openly to the distribution of political literature as inconsonant with the character of the Holy Land of Islam, but I was perhaps mistaken. The form of the circular is highly discreet, but I do not see why, when taken with the measures to which Fuad Bey referred in talking to me, it should not have considerable success in limiting Italian propaganda. As I men tioned in my report on the interview with Ibn Saud on January 4th (my des patch No. 1 of January 5th) the King said that he suppressed propaganda newspapers, etc., whenever they were discovered, and Fuad Bey informed me that the authorities had detected and put a stop to the practice by which the employees of the Italian Legation gave propaganda newspapers to the Saudi postmen to distribute on their rounds. It appears that the King was particularly incensed by the impudent piece of propaganda to which refer ence is made in Mr. Trott’s despatch No. 159 of October 11th, 1937, where a man formerly employed in a minor post in the Jedda Customs, who was alleged to have spoken in Eritrea in favour of the Fascist regime, was re presented by the Italians as being Director-General of Customs in Saudi Arabia.. 2. However discreet the wording of the circular I am confident that a serious attempt will be made to prevent the Italian Legation from spread- ing propaganda in this country. Measures are to be taken, Fuad Bey assures me, to prevent the use of the posts and the telephone for propaganda purposes, and orders are to be given to Saudi officials not to mix with mem bers of foreign missions except on official occasions. Thus the interpreter of the Italian Legation, Muhammad Ali Darfer, who it is believed is to be posted to Mecca, will be discouraged from visiting any officials except those of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or to hand propaganda to them, though it still remains to be seen whether the authorities will find means to pre vent the distribution of propaganda newspapers in the street, or to restrain Monsieur Darfer from visiting private persons in Mecca in’ order to spread propaganda for his Government. 3. It is to be hoped that the provisions of the circular will be applied exclusively to what Fuad Bey declares to be their real object and will not be used to hamper our pilgrimage work. It will be remembered that this Legation had noticed a tendency on the part of the Saudi authorities to compel the Indian Vice-Consul to apply for assistance to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs instead of the local authorities concerned—a procedure which would have greatly reduced his usefulness. The recently appointed Indian Vice-Consul has not noticed any such tendency, and indeed he receiv ed a warm welcome and promises of help from the Minister of Finance, 188(S) ExAflttirsDopt.22 who is in charge of the pilgrimage. I am therefore hopeful that any diffi culties which the Legation experienced in this respect during the last season or two were personal to the late Vice-Consul and vanished with his depar ture, and at present I do not fear that under cover of the present regulation the difficulties will begin again. 4 I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Cairo (No. 125/551/6), and Bagdad (No. 127/551/6), and to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine and Trans-Jordan (No. 126/551/6). Enclosure to Jedda despatch* No. 8 (124/551/6) of January 17th, 1938. No. 101/18/4. Translation. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mecca, 9th Dhu’l Qaa’da 1356. 10th January, 1938. Circular. I have the honour to explain to Their Excellencies the Ministers Pleni potentiaries and the Charges d’Affaires, that the Government of His Majesty the King, being desirous of facilitating the work of the Legations at Jedda had previously adopted a number of measures in order to enable them to maintain touch with this Ministry, and to carry out the formalities which the said Legations may require from it. It has been observed that on some occasions, official formalities are carried out between certain Legations and other offices instead of with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs direct, and since the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the official channel of communi cation between the Legations and the Government of His Majesty the King, I beg that this rule may be observed, and any action contrary to it avoided. In order to increase facilities of communications between the Legations and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Government of His Majesty think it fitting that Shaikh Ibrahim ibn Muammar, the Qaimmaqam of Jedda, shall be entrusted, in addition to his original duties, with the function of receiving the urgent statements or messages which the Legations may desire to communicate speedily to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and also that Shaikh Ali Taha, the assistant of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shall remain attached to him in connection with the work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This new arrangement will complete the arrangements previously made for the presence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or of his Deputy, in Jedda, and for meeting the [foreign] representatives there, and I trust that the result of the same will assist all of us in strengthening the relations and the bonds of friendship which happily exist between us.

( 20 ) {Received on the 2nd April 1938, with Political Secretary's letter No. 11, dated the 17th March 1938.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated the 15th March 1938. [E.-1099/10/31.] Letter from Sir R. Bullard, to Mr. Eden.—(Received February 28), (No. 21, Confidential), dated Jedda, February 2, 1938. As you are aware, it is extremely difficult to find out what people are thinking in this country. Contact with the local inhabitants, which has always been rare, has ceased altogether since the promulgation of the orders designed to circumscribe Italian propaganda on which I reported in my despatch No. 8, dated the 17th January, 1938, and in any case discipline is too strictly maintained by the King for Saudi subjects to speak freely to members of foreign Legations on lines which he might not approve. For these reasons I think it worth while to transmit to you the attached extract from a conversation which I had recently with M. Naidyonoff, the “White’’ Russian pilot employed by the Saudi Government. 2. The conversation arose out of a projected flight of three Saudi planes to Wejh, which has been the subject of discussion for several weeks. One is to be piloted by the Italian, Major Ciccii, a second by M. Naidyonoff, and the third by a Saudi, and the rest of the Saudi pilots are to be carried as passengers. The party would stay some ten days in Wejh, I gather, before returning. The start has been postponed several times for lack of one thing or another, and it has now been put off again because Major Ciccu is ill. When speaking to me about this flight on the 1st February, M. Naidyonoff said that he was thinking of giving up his post here because he did not want to be involved in hostilities. A few days before he had spoken of this possibility and had said that, whatever happened, he him self, as an officer who served in the Denikin army, would never take part in hostilities against the British. On both occasions I deprecated any talk about hostilities involving Saudi Arabia and, indeed, all talk about the imminence of war, but last night M. Naidyonoff seemed greatly disturbed. As will be seen from the enclosed note, his feelings are based on nothing more solid than the attitude of the commandant of the Jedda forces, Said- al-Kurdi, who admits that his anti-British policy is not that of is master, Ibn Saud. But it is interesting to hear of the influence which the views of an unpopular man have here, because, they are anti-British and pan- Arab. and thus coincide with those of the younger Saudis, and to learn24 « of the belief that, if a serious revolt broke out in Transjordan, it would attract the spontaneous participation of the Saudi tribes on the border, and when once the movement had begun Ibn Saud would have to allow it to con tinue or perhaps even to take part in it. 3. There is no doubt that at present Ibn Saud does not want anything of the sort to happen. If he had not been really attached to the view which he has professed on several occasions during the last eighteen months, viz., that his interests and those of His Majesty’s Government are identical, he would hardly have acted as he has done in regard to Palestine. The import ant question is how far he will continue to adhere to that view if there is no radical change in the Palestine policy of His Majesty’s Government. 1 have recently recorded my opinion that he continues to support His Majesty’s Government as far as he can because he cannot believe that in the long run they will carry out a policy grossly unjust (from his point of view) to the Arabs, and that his strong professions of friendship must not be regarded as a blank cheque. He has recently pointed out that his help in bringing about a restoration of order in Palestine so that the Royal Com mission could carry out its work, and later in inducing the Palestine Arabs to give evidence, resulted in disappointment for the Arabs, and has said that while he is ready to assist in bringing about an atmosphere in which the technical commission can begin its labours he cannot this time take the initiative. In fact, he assisted His Majesty’s Government and the Arabs got nothing out of it (again from their point of view, and his), and whereas last time he gave his assistance because of his general belief in the “justice” of His Majesty’s Government, he cannot afford to do that again. Of course, it may be that His Majesty’s Government have no further need of his good offices. I am not assuming that they are necessary to His Majesty’s Gov ernment, but am merely using the history of Ibn Saud’s attitude on the point to Show that his position seems to have become more difficult. 4. If, as seems evident, the Palestine question has gradually forced Ibn Saud into a position where he cannot be as helpful as he would like to be to His Majesty s Government, can it be guaranteed that, if the situation does not soon turn more to the advantage of the Arabs, he will not be obliged to become less and less friendly? I would not give any such guarantee and J R would be a mistake to trade too far upon his wish to maintain the .nendhest relations with His Majesty’s Government. What will con stitute in Arab eyes a favourable turn is a difficult problem, but I fear that no scheme which does not call a final halt to Jewish expansion in Palestine m some way or other, will have a chance of acceptance by the Arabs. I must admit that I myself favoured partition as a solution even before the Roval Commission began Re work, as placing a limit on Jewish expansion in the most definite way Whether the suggested scheme of partition would have- aroused less hostility among the Arabs if the reservations made in the despatch of the 23rd December, 1937, had appeared in the Statement of 1 dicy m July is an academic question, but of the strength of the hostility now there is no doubt. The main difficulty is perhaps the complete dis belief which Arab spokesmen profess to have in the ability of His Majesty’s Government to keep the Jews within any limits which may be fixed 3 Ibn baud does not go so far as to say that His Majesty’s Government are under the thumb of the Jew. but he has expressed a vehement ™ rp r L at whal ^ f ™ na n Ural an&lt;1 ’ lndeed &gt; irreligious combination of the Jews with His Majesty s Government.

Enclosure. Extract from a Note on a Conversation with M. Naidyonoff. The pilot, Ciccu, is ignored by the Saudi pilots, who do not even say good-morning to him (? on orders from the King). When Naidyonofi asks them why this rudeness they indicate that they don’t want any Italians. But one form of insult is no longer inflicted on Ciccu : he used to have to walk to the aerodrome, but Abdullah Sulaiman (Minister of 1 inance and Director of Defence) has now supplied him with a car. The only person who is friendly to Ciccu is Said-al-Kurdi, who is learning Italian from him, because, he says, it is bound to be useful in the next war, whichever side Saudi Arabia is on. Said-al-Kurdi is the only person who has a glimmering of understand ing of aviation, its uses, needs, limitations, etc. Abdullah Sulaiman is hopeless, but Kurdi listens, and also learns from experience. Kurdi is always telling Naidyonoff that if only the Saudi aeroplanes could fl\ along the Transjordan frontier, so that the tribes there could see that the Saudis had an air force, there would be an immediate rising m Transjordan, which would spread to Palestine, and the Saudi tribes would take part. Naidyonoff asked Kurdi whether this was Ibn Saud s policy. Kurdi said no, but if the movement started he would not stop it, but would have to back it up. . . Kurdi is very unpopular, but he is a single-minded fanatic on this subject and the young people listen to him. There is a tremendous amount of propaganda of this kind going on, designed to show that times are very difficult for His Majesty’s Government and that the opportunity should not be lost. Naidyonoff said that we ought to watch ‘ night and day in Trans jordan. _____ ( 21 ) (Received on the 9th April 1938, with Political Secretary’s letter No. IS, ^ dated the 2£th March 1938.) Copy.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated the 17th March 1938. Cypher telegram from Sir R. Bullard (Jedda), No. 55, dated the 6th March 1938. Your telegram No. 34, March 3rd. The Saudi Arabian Government were rather disturbed at the news about negotiations with Italy and I thought it well to convey assurance to them at once. They have replied in a note which will follow by bag. The chief point is an enquiry whether the Rome understanding of 1927 will be discussed and if so, whether His Majesty’s Government will persist in respecting it. I have reminded Fuad of recent assurances on this point and of the importance which the Italian Government also seem to attach to it and have said that I cannot imagine conversations having any result if successful but to confirm and even strengthen guarantee which the under standing affords to Saudi Arabia. The assurance just given should be sufficient as Fuad realises but to allay Ibn Saud’s nervousness you may like to make a specific statement on the point he raises. (23) Enclosure in Foreign Office, covering letter, dated the 4th May 1938. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, No. 64 (715/391/8), dated the 4th April 1938. I have the honour to inform you that the “Umm-al-Qura” of April 1st, announces that the Amir Khalid ibn Muhammad died near Riyadh in the early part of this week. The news had been received in Jedda from pi hate sources a day or two before, and it was stated on good authority that the Amir had met with his death through an accident on a shooting expedition, being flung from his car while chasing gazelle. 2. The Amir Khalid was the son of the King’s brother Muhammad. He was reputed to be a determined enemy of his cousin the Amir Saud, the heir apparent who took him with him wherever he went—even on the recent visit to Bahrain—and kept a close watch on him. There will be those who will try to find something sinister in the story of the accident, and the omission of the cause of death from the official announcement may do something to strengthen this suspicion. I may mention in this connec tion that when the Amir Saud was with the Athlone party on the shooting expedition at Rumhiya, Mr. Gault noticed that when the Amir said his prayers with his followers and the other Arabs in the camp, an armed man who did not take part in the prayers stood behind him the whole time. 3, When the news appeared in the Mecca press I telegraphed my condo lences to the Amir Faisal, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, but I did not think the matter suitable for the British Broadcasting Corporation Arabic roadcast and therefore did not send the news for inclusion in the newsr&gt; bulletin. (24) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated the 5th May 1938. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, No. 68 (765/270/2), dated the 11th April 1938. I have the honour to report the publication in the “Umm-al-Qura” of April 1st of a Regulation concerning the wholesale and retail trade in medicines, drugs, medical preparations and herbs”. The regulation which27 must have been copied straight from the statute-book of some highly orga nised state, is far too elaborate to be applied properly in this country, and I should hardly have thought it worth reporting but for one article which reads as follows :—. Article 21. The sale of proprietary medical preparations imported from abroad is prohibited, unless previous permission for the sale has been obtained, and the Public Health Department shall not authorise the sale without first taking specimens and ascertaining the composition, the effective medical substances which they contain, and the method of use. 2. Such British proprietary medical articles as to be found in this country must have a very small sale, but as even that small sale may be held up,if only for a time, by the promulgation of this regulation, 1 have thought the matter worth reporting. 3. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade [No. 11. (766/270/2]. (25) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated the 12th May 1938. [E.-1701/196/25.] Letter from Sir R, Bullard, to Viscount Halifax.—(Received March 28), (No. 46), dated Jedda, March 11, 1938. I have the honour to inform you that Ibn Saud summoned me to a final audience to-day before his departure for Mecca and thence to Nejd for his annual holiday. I was thus able to convey in person to the King, as well as by letter to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the congratulations on the discovery of oil in Hasa which you sent in your telegram No. 37, dated the 9th March. The King was much pleased at this mark of sympathy and expressed his appreciation and thanks. I have since received a letter in the same sense, written on the King’s behalf, from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 2. What with the visit of Her Royal Highness Princess Alice and Lord Athlone, every detail of whose journey he follows personally with the great est interest, and the discovery of oil, the King was in an excellent humour. He talked a good deal about European politics, going to pieces over names like Czechoslovakia, but showing a shrewd knowledge of the situation, but he did not refer to the projected negotiations between His Majesty’s Gov ernment and the Government of Italy, as I had thought he might do. 3 Much of the talk was about the Yemen. The Imam, said the King, was always worrying about something. He made a lot out of Philby’s journey, and the other day he said that the British were working up to Nejran and asked what the King was going to do about it. This seemed to amuse the King, who always seems to find the Imam slightly ridiculous. He proceeded to criticise the Yemenis as thoroughly factious and savage and untrustworthy, and related various incidents in support of this thesis. He then talked about the Hadhramaut in the sense of the communication from Fuad Bey which I have reported in my despatch No. 39, dated the 8th March. I hope to have time before the bag closes to give the gist of the King’s remarks as a postscript to that despatch. 4. The King repeated the kind invitation which he gave me on the occasion of Lord Belhaven’s visit (my despatch No. 9, dated the 19th Jan uary) to spend some time with him in the desert next spring, if the rains should be good. As he pressed for a reply, I could only say that, if His Majesty did not mind my being no great sportsman, I should be very glad to come. It seemed to me that I might do more good in camp with the King for a week or so, than sitting at a desk in Jedda, and I trust that you will approve my general acceptance of the invitation.D. O.

It was entitled “The Future of Arabia” and dated the 18th September 1931. I made an addition to it dated the 23rd February &gt;1933 in regard to Kuwait. 3. I entirely agree with you that so long as Ibn Saud lives there is rot much likelihood of a serious revolt, but as he gets older he may not be able to carry on his “one man show” with the vigour he displays at present, and the Arabs have a grim proverb : “When the camel stumbles (Le., gets past its work) out comes the knife. ^ I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe and Peel.

It is now possible to complete the story of the death of the Amir Khalid, nephew to Ibn Sand, which I had the honour to report to you in my despatch No. 61 (715/391/8), dated April 4th. The details given in the Kuwait Intelligence Summary for March 16th to 31st bear out the information obtained from Shaikh Hafiz Wehba, who was in Nejd at the time. A violent check to the car which he was driving at high speed flung the Amir against the wind-screen with such force that he died of his injuries a few days later, but he lived long enough to be seen alive by an American Mission ary doctor who had been sent for from Kuwait. 2. The Hejazi malcontent whose complaints I reported in my despatch No 78 (875/287/14), dated April 24th declared that the death of the Amir Khalid was not due to an accident, but had been planned long beforehand. 1 he death of the chief rival to the Heir Apparent might well appear to hostile Arab eyes too fortunate to be accidental, and the fact that the cause of death was not mentioned in the reports in the Mecca press could be quoted as addi tional evidence. I do not think that any unprejudiced person here would accept the theory of a planned murder, but with persons so closely protect ed by armed guards as Ibn Saud or the Amir Saud, a hasty gesture of anger by a known enemy might possibly be misinterpreted by an armed slave and provoke a fatal shot or dagger-thrust. However, there is no question of this in the present case.. ( 28 ) Foreign Office, S. W. 1. E.-2829/150/91. Heference demi-official letter P. Z.-2887/38, May 3rd. With Mr. Baxter’s compliments. J. P.

In my last conversation with Shaikh Hafiz Wahba before his departure for England I spoke of the various questions on which we were trying to give Ibn Saud advice or assistance. Shaikh Hafiz said that the King still felt very sore about the Qatar boundary, and unable to reconcile our attitude with our professions. The King, according to Shaikh Hafiz, attributes the attitude of H. M. Government on this point entirely to the fact that the oil company operating in Hasa is American, and feels this all the more unjust in that he repeatedly tried to get British oil interests to put in for a conces sion there. I said that our attitude was based on historical considerations going back long before the days of oil, and spoke highly of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company., The final decision will probably have been taken before this letter reaches you, but I send the information nevertheless “to complete the record”.30 (29) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 13th July 1938.

It has always been supposed, I think, that the Saudi regime was very much a one-man show and that anything might happen if Ibn Saud died, so that when I wrote my despatch No 78 of April 25th I felt that I was expounding the obvious But the despatch arose out of the complaints of the Hejazi I quoted, and moreover I had been thinking about the possible effect on Saudi Arabia of a steady revenue from31 oil which might enable the ruler to pension all Nejd out of oil money and to leave the pilgrims to the Hejazis. I dealt with the point in a later des patch No. 83-E. (908/284/3) of April 30th last. t What matters however, it seems to me, is what is to be done (1) now, in view of the Palestine tangle, and (2) if we become involved in a world conflict while Ibn Saud is still alive. I wish I could feel certain that no such conflict will come upon us within the next ten years, which is not an un reasonable period to give Ibn Saud: he may live and reign effectually for even longer. I am sending a copy of this letter, and of yours, to Baxter. (31) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated the 20th August 1938. [E.-4187/196/25.} Letter from Sir R. Bullard, to Viscount Halifax.—(Received July 15), (No. 132), dated Jedda, June 28, 1938. I have the honour to enclose herewith a translation of an interesting announcement from the Umm-al-Qura, reporting that at a cc-nference held in Riyadh in May it was agreed that a Higher Council of State should be set up and that the military system of the country should be reorganised on a more regular basis. 2. Why the new council is to be called the Higher Council of State is not made clear. There is at present a Legislative Assembly, and a stand ing committee of the Council of Ministers. The Legislative council seems to deal only with administrative, never with political questions. The other body apparently serves by standing, for, according to Fuad Bey, who is a member of it : it does nothing else. The High Council of State is apparently to be consulted on political matters, since it is to consider “public affairs touching the State and its preservation.” While Ibn Saud makes his own decisions, he is quite right in claiming, as he has done on occasion, that he first listens to advice, and he listens to it openly in a manner which the European Dictators would consider ruinous to their reputations. It is, I think, legitimate to suppose that the council will be a safety-valve for its members, who can give their opinions on Palestine and the Arab world and European politics, and for the King a formal means by which he can make his opinions and decisions on questions of high policy known to the people. 3. In view of the forecast made in paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 103-E., dated the 22nd May, it is interesting to see that a standing army trained on more or less modern lines is to be created with the aid of oil revenues—for that is evidently the “economic resources” Ibn Saud has in mind. We have never been told what reply Ibn Saud returned to the Iraq proposal for the introduction of some measure of unification in the training and equipment of the two armies^ but it is probable that that proposal will be taken into account when the tens of thousands of Arabs are assembled, clad in unaccustomed trousers, in their barracks. It may be some little time before the collection of oil royalties allows of a serious beginning with this plan, and it is therefore early to speculate whether the proposed force will be more efficient than tribal levies, and, if so, whether it will conduce to the stability of the Saudi regime by providing the ruler for the time being with a sure protection against any attempt to overthrow him. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Cairo and Bagdad, and to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine at Jerusalem^32 iCopj. '(E.-4187/196/25.) Riyadh Conference for the year 1357. Establishment of a Higher Council of State, and a new Military Organisation in Nejd, {from the Umm-al- Qura of the 2Ath June, 1938). Our readers are aware that His Majesty the King is accustomed to call a general meeting every year at the time when crowds of people come to see him at Riyadh. Sometimes reports of this annual conference have been published, sometimes not. This year the conference was held about the middle of Rabi’-al-Awwal (about mid-May). It was attended by the amirs of the royal family, the ulama, important officials and thinking men. His Majesty the King, who presided over the conference, reviewed the home and foreign situation, and explained to all present the need for caution and watchfulness, and for the adoption of such preparations as are commanded by the Quran. His Majesty also set forth the necessity to consider two matters for the maintenance of the state internally and externally. The first is the establishment of a Higher Council of State, to be con stituted in accordance with a special law, to consider public affairs touch ing the state and its preservation. The second is the examination of the Military organisation and the re - placement of the present system by a new one whereby the forces in Nejd may become more useful and effectual. This can only be effected by giving troops a scientific training in special barracks so that there may (always) be under training some tens of thousands of men (ready) to move at the order of their commander-in-chief in any direction, supported by the reserve forces in the country. His Majesty stated that he had only been prevented from putting this proposal into effect earlier by the shortage in the state revenue, and that, believing that this financial crisis would now be resolved by the revenue to be expected from economic resources in this country, he thought it necessary to hurry on with the business. His Majesty’s statements were received by all with delight and joy, and his proposals were unanimously supported and approved. His Majesty therefore issued orders for the necessary preparations to be made to put the two schemes into effect. We pray that Allah may bestow on this country and other Arab coun tries what may strengthen Islam and Moslems in general and the Arabs in particular, and that he may preserve His Majesty and keep him as treasure to Islam and to the Arabs. i</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000078_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/345</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000078</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/345</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 11/2 Diaries and Report: Arabia Series'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1936/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-02-20T22:15:02</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (108 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 110; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
