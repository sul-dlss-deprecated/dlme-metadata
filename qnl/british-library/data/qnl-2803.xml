I n r . r / % * V.,' ■«. ; -rygl^ r\ dM | My Lord, Under cover of despatch No. 185(E4286/98/25) of the 22nd June, 1939, Your Lordship was so good as to send me a copy of a despatch from Tokyo, No. 65 of the 21st April, in which a report was made on the visit to Mecca of five Chinese Moslems under the leadership of T 1 ang-Yi-Ch f en. I now have the honour to report, for the information of Your Lordship^ department, all the information which I have 'been able to gather from local sources concerning recent Chinese and Japanese propaganda in this country. It will 'be remembered that the Saudi Arabian Government were careful to point out recently &gt; U^r v ^ that when Japanese representatives made enquiries concerning oil concessions not yet allotted in this country, they put their prices so high that there was little chance of the Japanese taking advantage of the offer. I think therefore that it is safe to assume that the Saudi Government do not view the Japanese efforts to spread their influence v/estwards with any enthusiasm, and though they may have felt flattered that a mosque was recently opened with grand ceremony in Tokyo, it is unlikely that they will take any particular interest in Japanese pilgrims until such pilgrims begin to come in some numbers and to spend a good deal of money in this country. Nevertheless the following reports, which are believed to be accurate though they all come from somewhat indirect sources, show that the pilgrimage brings to our notice certain side-lights on Chinese, Japanese and Central Asian affairs, which I hope may be of some interest/ The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G., etc*, e oc., etc* His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, S.W.l.interest to the officials concerned. * fa.. 2. A certain Yahya, aged rather more than twenty, the son of a pilgrim guide of Chinese Turkestan origin named Abdullah Musa Bukhari, is said to be the secret agent of the Japanese Government in Jedda. A journey which he made to Japan in 1938, ostensibly to study electricity, was paid for by the Japanese Government. Yahya knew about the arrival of T*ang-Yi-Ch’en on pilgrimage early this year, but he syys that T*ang-Yi-Ch 1 * 3 4 en, who was under another name, did not enter into contact with him at Jedda and, on being spoken to in Mecca, told Yahya to avoid him. According to Yahya T ’ ang-Yi-Ch 1 en v/as successful in his anti-British oropaganda among the hundred odd Chinese pilgrims who came to Mecca last season. On the other hand anti-Japanese propaganda v/as conducted, according to Yahya, by Chinese Moslem students from A1 Azhar University in Cairo and by one Yusuf Isa from Hongkong and a certain Abdullah from Paris, both of them originally from Chinese Turkestan. Yahya also states that _an Indian named Muham mad Ali N air is a prominent anti-British propagandist in Japan, and that he has connexions with the Japanese Foreign Office. Yahya recently received from the Japanese Minister in Cairo a copy of a pamphlet published in Cairo in Arabic, extolling Chang-Kai-Shek and attacking the Japanese. The Minister asked Yahya whether copies of this pamphlet had been distributed in the Hejaz and if so, v/ith v/hat effect; Yahya replied that in point of fact no copies of this pamphlet (a copy of which has been secured by this Legation) had been distributed here. 3. The foregoing information does not conflict greatly with some parts of T 1 ang-Yi-Ch 1 en 1 s story. The 'bogus representatives' were no doubt the Chinese students from A1 Azhar. 4. As for the story of the massacre of one thousand pilgrims } v/ho were on their way from Bokhara or Hsinkiang, the same story had been circulated here long before the last pilgrimage by Yahya 1 sfather, the Bokharan pilgrim guide. It sounded so fantastic and improbable that it was regarded as an idle tale. Bukhari said that he had heard it from a friend in India : that the Russians had murdered all the party, with the exception of one survivor, before the party reached Afghanistan. 5. Mr. T T ang-Yi~Ch f en 1 s story about thirty thousand followers of General Ma making their way to Mecca where they took up commerce is too absurd to need comment. The arrival of the General with a few companions last year was duly reported and formed the subject of correspondence with the Government of India: he performed the pilgrimage of 1938 and went on, it is thought to Turkey. 6. Another report states that a Japanese named Kawamura, alias Muto, who embraced Islam in Hsinkiang about 1920, recently arrived in Peking from Japan with instructions to carry on anti- British propaganda under the cloak of religion, with the ultimate aim of visiting the country as a pilgrim. Nothing has been heard of this person here. It is thoughtthat he may be identical v/ith a Japanese named Kawamura who was arrested by the Chinese in 1919 for inciti ng the Moslems in Kansu to rebel. His name in Chinese was given as Chuan-Chung-Yima, and he became a Moslem in 1912 : he was the author of an article called 'Pan-Yellowism and Mohamedanism” in which he argued that the responsibility of leading the asiatic races against the white races devolved upon Japan : he is also stated to have lost his right arm- 7.

The possibility of the Japanese securing oil concessions in Saudi Arabia, perhaps on the Persian Gulf, is disturbing but need not be taken too seriously at this stage, since these is good reason to accept Sir R. Bullard’s statement that the Saudi Arabian talks with the Japanese are mainly for the purpose of forcing up bids by the California Arabian Standard Oil Co. and Petroleum Concessions Ltd, and the Saudi Arabian Government may be sincere in saying they do not wish to let the Japanese in (Sd) J.P.Gibson, 2/5. It would be most unwelcome if the Japanese were to get a footing in Saudi/Saudi Arabia, partic larly in Hasa, Tsut we can assume that the American Company will he prepared to go to considerable lengths financially to keep them out.

The Saudi Government seem to have told the California Arabian Standard Oil Company of this proposal which they have made to the Japanese Minister. The Minister is stated to have approved it '’personally'' and to have said that he would submit it to his Government. 6.

Japanese Minister at Cairo arrived March 24th and visited Ibn Saud at Riyadh. Yusuf Yasin gives the following information about the visit. 2. Draft Treaty of Friendship and Commerce given to Saudi Minister in London, when in Tokyo last year, has been amended by Saudi Government to provide for purchase quota of Saudi Exports by Japan. Minister is sending amended draft to his Government. 3. Minister proposed conclusion of an anti-Comintern pact. Saudi Government refused, on grounds that communism made no appeal in this country and that they are on good terms with Soviet Russia. 4. Minister asked about oil concessions and was told story of Government terms for two areas for v/hich I.P.C. recently offered £30,000 each (see my despatch No. 33 E of February 23rd). One of the areas includes wadi Sirhan. Terms are fantastic. They are apparently copied from a concession granted in Iraq, 1932, which provides not only for the usual royalty but also for heavy rent for several years and in addition they require immediate payment of £200,000 gold. Yusuf Yssin admitted that for political reasons/0 u 2 . reasons Japan might he prepared to pay muca more than a business firm, hut said that the question of food come first. He represented the Government^ need of money as desperate and American and British firms as greedy and unhelpful. He said that they would much prefer American or British firm, hut if the Japanese made an offer which the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company refused to equal in virtue of their opulence, the Saudi Government f could only accept it. There is doubtless some blackmail in this but Saudi Government undoubtedly believe that the terms granted hitherto have been ruinously unfavourable to them.

Sir, Mr. Akira Kodaki, a Third Socretary of the Japanese Embassy, recently informed a member of this Department that a representative of the Saudi Arabian Government had suggested to a representative of the Japanese Government that the Japanese Government should open a Legation at J edda. 2. It appeared from Mr. Kodaki’s comments that the Japanese Government might have been under the impression that Saudi Arabia was either a British Protectorate or at any rate in alliance with the United Kingdom in the same way as Egypt or Iraq^. It was explained to Mr. Kodaki that this was not the case and that Saudi Arabia was an entirely independent State, not in alliance with this country. 3. Mr. Kodaki expressed his thanks for this information and said that the Japanese Government had desired to inform His Majesty’s Government of the suggestion because it was their wish to do nothing incompatible with Anglo- Japanese friendship. Mr. Kodaki was assured that His Majesty’s Government would much appreciate the courtesy of the Japanese Government.
