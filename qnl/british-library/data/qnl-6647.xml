Control of South Persian Rifles. 1 . From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Army Department, J 9f/t March 1917. 345G. Your telegram of 24th February, 2731. Fars. Turkish retreat in Mesopotamia and Persia confirms War Cabinet in opinion expressed in first sentence of my telegram of 14th February, but in view of Maude’s distance from Basra and his other preoccupations they have decided that Bushire force should revert to you. General Officer Commanding, Bushire, will take his orders from you only, but you will, of course, consult Marling freely, and refer to me when necessary, it is assumed that should it become necessary to reinforce Bushire you will be able to do so. As regards Sykes, War Cabinet understand that you have sent him an experienced administrative staff officer and a qualified general staff officer, and they consider that a good financial adviser should also be sent. They think that with these additions to bis staff he ought to be able to deal with situation as modified by our successes elsewhere, and they prefer to keep him in his present position for further period. As War Cabinet have decided that Sykes shall remain under orders of Sir C. Marling, no responsibility will attach to you except for complying with his requisitions for personnel and material when they are reasonable and practicable, and informing me promptly when they are not. Sykes should understand that his permanent appointment will depend upon the satisfaction which he now gives, and in particular that expenditure on the present scale cannot be tolerated ; that South Persian Rifles must be launched on lines on which Persian Government can afford to maintain it, and that careful economy must therefore be observed. 2 . From Sir C. Marling (Tehran) to Lord Hardinge, 23rd April 1917 . Private. A trifling circumstance has arisen which raises great doubt in my mind as to suitability of present apportionment /&gt;f control of South *Persian Rifles, according to which India is charged only with duties of finding personnel and material and supervising expenditure, all other matters being left to direction of Legation. This seems to me unpractical. Would it not be better to leave all technical questions of organisation, distribution, and handling of the force as well as of expenditure and supply of personnel and material under India control ? These are matters quite outside my competence on which civil criticism would be very unpalatable to soldiers. I would urge that it is for Military Department of Government of India to supervise creation and (? founding of the force and for Legation to decide for what purposes (other than ordinary gendarmerie work on roads, Ac.) it is to be used, when and in what direction it is to be used, when and in what direction it is to extend its sphere of work, and in general all cases involving political interests, while there must be of course mutual consultation when any proposed action by either authority is calculated to have effects in the domain of the other. Cossack Brigade has always worked on this (group undecipherable).J o. From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 2oth April 1917. (Addressed to Sir P. Sykes, repeated to Tehran and Secrcbarn of State ' for India, as 511 S.) Secret In future you should address your telegrams dealing with -npr&lt;jnnnel and material and other technical matters connected with organisation South Persian Rifles direct to Chief of General Staff, without repeating them to this Department. You should, however, keep this Denar tment informed of general political situation affecting your force, and repeat to it all telegrams of political and general interest addressed by you to Minister. 4 . From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Army 14t/i j\lay 1917. 985. Your telegram in the Foreign Department, dated 25th April, No. 511 S. South Persian Rifles. Foreign Office propose that all technical questions touching the organisation, distribution, and handling of this foice should be under your control as well as the duty of finding personnel and material and supervising expenditure in accordance with existing arrange ments. Legation would decide for what purposes (other ^ than ordinary policing of roads) force is to be used, when and in what direction it is to extend” phere of work and generally all matters involving political interests. And there would be mutual consultation when any proposal made by one authority is likely to affect sphere of other. Do you agree ? 5. From Viceroy, Army Department, 19/5 May 1917. 7358. Your telegram of the 14th instant, 985. We have consulted Commander-in-Chief, whose views are as follows :— “ I regret I cannot agree for the following reasons :—(l) As reported in correspondence ending with your 3456, of 19th March, which conveyed the decision of the War Cabinet, we have lost confidence in Sykes. (2) This proposal coming from Foreign Office, and not apparently the War Cabinet, involves dual control in that it would make us responsible for the adminis trative and tactical efficiency' of the South Persia Rifles without the deciding voice in the employment of that force. (3) In my opinion the South Persian Rifles in now practically a military organisation, and should be under one control like other forces. (4) Mutual consultation with Legation is apt to result in delay and confusion, and I still adhere to the system recommended in our telegram No. 940 of 21st January and subsequent correspondence.’' We agree generally but realise that His Majesty’s Government may be disinclined in present circumstances to place proposed General Officer Commanding in suprome control, both military and political, of Southern Persia. If so, w r e should prefer to adhere to present arrangement, whereby we are merely responsible for material, personnel, and audit. We cannot accept responsibility for organisation, distribution, and handling unless we are invested with full authority to decide purposes for which force is to be used beyond mere police duties, subject always to the orders of His Majesty s Government and to consultation with Minister. These are our views with regard to present conditions, without prejudice to ultimate post-bellum, arrangements.3 0 . /' rom Sir C. Marling {Tehran), YMh June 1017 . {Repeated to Government of India.) No. 202. South Persian Rifles. rv / t r Qp ff CU fo n T'o In . s P fcotor -C'eneral and Colonel Hunter, til! lately Chief ot Staff of South Persian Rifles, I have come to the conclusion th t under existing system of control, both on technical and financial matters It is impossible to expect good progress with organisation of force, and that it, is essential to give Inspector-General much greater latitude. i A 1 t 1 P , reS ' ?nt t° be intended by Government of India that force should be organised on model of Imperial Army, and if South Persian Rifles ueie to form part oi the latter, rigid adherence would be justified and necessary. But as South Persian Rifles (implies) Persian force, modifications required by local conditions must be introduced as experience acquired shows. Conditions of service and appointment of officers also require revision Ihere seems to be no adequate reason whv appointments in f ersian force, permanent in the case of Persian Officers, and temporary in the case of British, should not be made on the authority of Inspector-General subject to approval, perhaps, of Persian Government, but with {sic ? without) reference home; while as regards conditions of service, k is obvious that if good results are to be obtained, something must be done to render them attractive. At present such is the state of uncertainty that even Chief of the Staff does not know what pay he is entitled to draw. 1 would suggest that British officers be seconded, say, for five years, with guarantees for'their professional prospects, and that local or acting rank granted to British personnel by Inspector-General should carry pay, permanent promotion of non-commissioned officers being made in consultation with their British Regimental authorities, and that officers holding temporary British com missions be provided, if they desire it, with permanent commissions in South Persian Rifles. • In financial matters greater freedom is still more indispensable. At present compliance with minutiae of Indian regulations is exacted with result that in the absence of (? adequate) clerical staff Britisli officers have to neglect training men in favour of desk work. Moreover it seems unreason able to seek to apply Indian regulations to very dissimilar conditions of Persia—regulations moreover, which, however suitable for an already organised force, must be applied with great elasticity in the case of one in process of formation. It seems also useless to inaugurate system of control which will (group undecypherable) be dropped when cost'of South Persian Rifles is borne by Persia. Only practical course seems to be that Inspector-General should be authorised to spend up to limit of his approved budget of three million tomans with power to make transfers as experience and expediency dictate with an independent auditor at his headquarters. Great distances and inadequate and at present insecure postal communications make final ( ? ) foreign audit extremely difficult, nor does it seem possible that economy to % be ensured thereby will be in any way commensurate with labour and waste of time involved. It appears to me impossible for Inspector-General to produce satisfactory results if he is to have his hands tied by red-tape regulations framed for totally different conditions. It is, on the contrary, imperative to give him fullest possible powers. Sir P. Sykes has communicated to me a provisional scheme of organisation which I am sending by next bag, and I venture to urge that if it is approved by His Majesty’s Government he may be at once empowered to act in general accordance with it, provided he remain within limits of budget estimate in local Currency, and that effect may be given to my recommendations as regards conditions of service of British officers.From Sir C. Marling (Tehran), ISth June 1017. Xo 203. Government of India’s telegram No. 7358 of 10th May, repeated tn me at the request of Secretary of State for India. . have not had message to which above-mentioned te egram is a reply &gt;mt 1 P thinkl from context that it refers to questions ot supervision both ? l v.,1 and financial of Soutfi Persian Rifles and of authority which will '(Cup ouiitteTwith regard to its employment. On former question 1 have expressed my views in my immediately preceding telegram and on the Tatter His Majesty’s Government have already taken decision. I desire now to offer some remarks on point of view from which Government of India appear °to view South Persian Rifles. From their reverting to proposal contained in their telegram No. 940 they seem to believe it would be (? advantageous) appointing to replace Sir P. Sykes a General ot iig i ian with full control over both civil and military in Southern Persia, to utilise South Persian Rilles for British interests and even as m some way an adjunct to Imperial forces. Idea is wholly fallacious Persian feeling is not with us and even if it were, mere appointment of an officer with such a mission would suffice to arouse suspicion that we design to take over administration of Southern Persia. South Persian Rifles, if they did not actually turn against him as I believe they would, would not support him but would desert with their arms (for it is surely too much to expect that semi-mutinous troops taken over by us a few months ago will have become so loyal as to obey their foreign officers against their own Government) and his authority would repose on nothing but some 2,000 Indian troops who have still to earn respect in Southern Persia. . . . . With altered conditions brought about uy Russian revolution only possible way of making a success of South Persian Rifles is to make it a truly Persian force to be used by Persian Government, and if we try and impose it by such means as Government of India suggest, we shall have to send 20,000 men for the purpose. Sir P. Sykes thoroughly understands this, and for this reason I hope there will be no question of replacing him on account of dissatisfaction of Government of India with his work. 1 do not know grounds foi dis satisfaction, hut it is but fair to point out that from his arrival at Shiraz until he received a large addition to his staff this spring, Sir P Sykes was set a task utterly out of proportion to means supplied to him. I‘^m not competent to judge results he has achieved, but Military Attache who has visited Shiraz considers they reflect greatest credit on Sir P. Sykes and his staff. True comprehension of political aspect of this matter is at least as essential to success as organising ability. Sir P. Sykes possesses the former, and the latter can be supplied by competent staff which may be attached to him.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000163_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/C165</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000163</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/C165</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Mesopotamia Administrative Council.

The file consists of the following seven telegrams, which were submitted to the War Cabinet:Secretary of State for India [Joseph Austen Chamberlain] to the Viceroy of India [Frederic John Napier Thesiger], 19 March 1917;Sir Charles Murray Marling, British Minister at Tehran, to Lord Hardinge [Charles Hardinge, former Viceroy of India], 23 April 1917;Viceroy of India [Frederic John Napier Thesiger], addressed to Sir Percy Sykes and repeated to the British Minster at Tehran and the Secretary of State for India, 25 April 1917;Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy of India, 14 May 1917;Viceroy of India to the Secretary of State for India, 19 May 1917;Sir Charles Murray Marling, British Minister at Tehran, to the Government of India, 13 June 1917;Sir Charles Murray Marling, British Minister at Tehran, to the Government of India, 13 June 1917.The telegrams are concerned with how and by whom the South Persian Rifles should be controlled. In his telegram of 14 May 1917, the Secretary of State for India informs the Viceroy of India that the Foreign Office has proposed that all technical questions regarding the organisation, distribution, and handling of the force should be placed under the Government of India's control, and that the British Legation at Tehran should decide for what purpose force is to be used, as well all matters involving political interests.In his telegram of 19 May 1917, the Viceroy argues that the Government of India cannot accept responsibility for the organisation and distribution of the South Persian Rifles unless it is invested with full authority to decide the purposes for which force is to be used.Sir Charles Murray Marling, in his telegrams dated 13 June 1917, argues that greater freedom should be given to the Inspector-General of the South Persian Rifles [Sir Percy Sykes], both in financial matters and in the appointment of Persian and British officers. He suggests that the only possible way of making a success of the South Persian Rifles is to make it a truly Persian force to be used by the Persian Government.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>South Persia Rifles</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>South Persia Rifles, Inspector-General</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>War Cabinet</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Armed forces</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000163#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
