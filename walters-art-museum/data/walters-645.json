The god of wisdom, writing, and administration, Thoth embodied the moon's dynamic nature; his knowledge extended to the science of numbers, medicine, and all magical secrets.\r\n\r\nThis figure combines iconographical elements which refer to several deities. The human-shaped body with long wig and uraeus above the forehead, together with a moon-disk and crescent, represents the moon god Iah. The ibis head refers to Thoth, the Atef-crown with the feathers stands for the god of the netherworld, Osiris, and the ram horns represent Amun. Because the disk can be interpreted as moon or sun-disk, it is likely that in combination with the ram horns the solar aspect of Amun, or Amun-Re, is intended.  All of these different elements express the idea of the renewal of moon and sun, and therefore also of the donor of such a figure in his afterlife.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/27232", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Henry Walters, Baltimore [date of acquisition unknown], by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "26th-30th Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2012-11-30T22:00:00.96", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.2068_3QtrLft_DD_T12.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.2068_3QtrLft_DD_T12.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.2068_3QtrLft_DD_T12.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.2068_3QtrLft_DD_T12.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.2068_3QtrLft_DD_T12.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "2172", "Images": "PS1_54.2068_3QtrLft_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_54.2068_3QtrRt_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_54.2068_Back_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_54.2068_Fnt_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_54.2068_Lft_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_54.2068_Rt_DD_T12.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
