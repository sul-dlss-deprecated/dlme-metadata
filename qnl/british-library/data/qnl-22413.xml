Very stony B a r m a Plateau 1 a! ’An A! Jubai! Region KUWAIT-RIYADH MOTOR TRACK (1) Crossing of DAHANA SANDS is approx: 69 K- M. by motor traek, and crossing is done in lb hours- Sands are brick red in eolour. {2) The two bad sand ridges or“ARAIG' are AR/Q SIRRU and ARIQ RUAICHIB- These have dozens of tracks across them, made by drivers trying to find good ways across. A guide is necessary when crossing the sands for the first time. (3) A single prominent “Talha' Tree (Acacia) shows up on ARIQ IMR to guide the traveller. (4) Very good grazing exists all over DAHANA SANDS - Arfaj ' bushes lying jhick predominate in southern half of sands. On northern edge the Arta dwarf tree grows thickly, and 'Arfaj' grows thinner. (5) Other bushes and grasses appear to grow in profusion in spring, judging from many dry varieties found in October. (6) At RUM AH there are 5 wells, giving good water, at depth of 210. Wells are well revetted with stones- (7) For 10 miles S- W- of RUM AH WELLS surface of roadway is good, being gravelly. A fterwards and until bottom of BUWAIB PASS is reached, road passes through very stony country over which cars must move slowly. (Speed here 25 M, P- H-) (8) From bottom of BUWAIB PASS to RIYADH CITY road crosses a broad flat plain which evidently gives trouble after rains, the surface being largely of clay. In October track is somewhat bumpy, due to deep old ruts, but improves the nearer one gets to RIYADH. Last 16 miles is very good, and high speeds can be maintained. (9) The motor track to HASS A branches off sharp to the right, immediately one crosses ARIQ HAMRANI (going north). The KUWAIT track here is fawty marked so care is required otherwise one may miss it. (10) A ford V. s. car requires 9 tins (4 gall ) of petrol for journey KUWAIT - RIYADH. (Three tins in tank and 6 tins in reserue). Ho petrol is available at JAHIYA or RUM AH WELLS- Two skins of water (reserve) should be taken per car. (11) Ordinary travellers are held up at JARIYA POST till orders are received from RIYADH. Enquiry is made by wireless. (12) A fordV-8. car well loaded up. will make RIYADH from KUWAIT in 17^ running hours. (13) At RIYADH there are 2 wireless stations, a Post Office, a workable telephone system, a well equipped garrage and workshop capable of holding 160 cars. (14) The Royal Palace is electrically lit, power being obtained by a modern engine housed inside the town. (15) Kh: to denote a headland stands for ‘‘Khnshm” = Nose - ditto Sh: stands for 'Shaib' or water course. CORRECTION. Above diagram of BUWAIB PASS and immediately surrounding cou/thy /rom Philbus map (sheet 9: War Office 1:5.000,000 1933) which makes ABU RUKHAIN headland extend southwards in a straight line to K^SHM AL AN, 28 miles away. The large re-entrant or bay between the ARM A and BARMA Plateaus is not shown. Similarly no mention is made on same sheet of DHARAIYEH the 'orqennd well preserved ancient capital of the WAHABIS, situate 15 miles N. W- of RIYADH. Both mistake and omission are doubtless due to errors in copying. 46 47</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100025656284.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/361, ff 14-17</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100025656284.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/361, ff 14-17</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Sketch map showing Motor Road from Kuwait to Riyadh'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1938/1938</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-06-03T09:44:48</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 map (3 sheets)</extent><extent>Materials: 3 paper folios.Condition: the folios have tears and creases.Foliation: this item has a foliation number in the top right hand corner of each folio; the number is enclosed by a circle.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>'Sketch map showing Motor Road from Kuwait to Riyadh', on three sheets, prepared by Lieutenant Colonel Harold Richard Patrick Dickson, CIE Chief Local Representative of Kuwait Oil Company, Kuwait.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100025656284.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
