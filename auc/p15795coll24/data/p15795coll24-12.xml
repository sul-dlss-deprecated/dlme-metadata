A family member named Mohamed and two unnamed women were present at the interview and made comments throughout.  Born and raised on the Qurna hillside, she and the two other women describe aspects their earlier lives there, such as living in a spacious family home. Fatema recollects moments from her childhood, and the social life and sense of community of Qurna.  She explains the importance of tourism for Qurnaâ€™s residents, who relied on income from tourists visiting the area. Fatema speaks of the passing of old beliefs and values on the hillside, for example how residents came to rely on Western medicine rather than traditional medical practices. Some traditions had remained, she claims, describing how weddings and other festivities were celebrated. She recalls certain noteworthy events in the past, such as a period of heavy rains that caused extensive damage to many homes.  Fatema also relates her experience of relocation from Qurna to a new settlement in an isolated area on a mountain, away from the rest of her family. This led her to sell the small apartment she had been given and go to live with her brother, as she was unmarried and living alone was difficult; she expresses a desire for the government authorities to provide her a residence near her family.  Fatema reflects that living on the Qurna hillside, despite its hardships, was happier than her life since being relocated.  </dc:description><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:coverage>Al Qurnah, Egypt</dc:coverage><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>Qurna Hillside Oral History Project; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
