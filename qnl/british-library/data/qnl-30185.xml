Director General of Municipalities, expressed ae 4 esire to dispense with formalities and caw His Majesty’s Consul v/ithin a few hours of his arrival. He tiien went immediately with His Majesty 1 s Consul to the Minister of the Interior. The Minister of the Interior explained that the government were very concerned about the wheat situation in Tehran as they had at the most ten days supplies in hand and that unless he could obtain five thousand tons immediately the£e would be riots in the capital and the Government would almost certainly fall. He stated that His Majesty 5 3 Charge 4*Affaires and ©ther officials at the British Legation had (k=ri&lt;LjL-V * V— a — / been\ 0) 'been coneulted 'but they had been unable to produce the wheat bo he had come down to Khuzistan himself to make the necessary arrangements. He was convinced that the British military or civil authorities had ample stocks in Shuzistan cr Iraq and he endeavoured to blu : ££ His Majesty’s Consul into producing five thousand tons within twenty four hours. In spits ®f his best efforts His Majesty’s Consul was unable to locate more than about 151)0 tons which the authorities 3.

Security No outstanding incidents occurred, though the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company has continued to suffer thefts of telephone wireI With reference to para 4 of this Consulate diary for February 1942, the dispute between the externed Beni ?uruf Sheikhs and the Iraqi to whom their lands were given died a natural death as the Iraqi no longer felt it safe to remain at Cusangird and the tenants began to pay rent to th^ir ®ld landlords. A dispute over irrigation rights arising at the same time was similarly settled- A somewhat ill advised letter from the Acting Crovernor-General dated 30th -June confirming the title of the dispossessed Iraqi caused some consternation. The area, however, when recently visited, appeared quiet, and the Sheikhs ready to act on the advice given to avoid any resort to armed force. 6 . British Army The manufacturers of ice in Ahwaz have been confirmed in their evil courses. An officer from the ^enth Army attemptedhreopen negotiations by offering to supply ammonia; he was informed that even if sufficient ammonia was provided for the factory ? s entire daily output of 20 tons, the army could not have more than seven tons. A highly obscure circular from the Ministry of the Interior relating to British Military contracts has been received by the Acting Governor-General. The Governor- General is apparently instructed to request from the British Military authorities particular of all existing contracts for the supply of foodstuff and to request that all future contracts be made through ’ 5 the Persian authorities; they will then either recommend contractors whose rates are approved or supply £he articles at Municipal rates.

INDIA OFFIC4, Wheat -T A ~\T (iy (a) The i. t’aa tion developed rapidly o I I&lt; engthy dis cussions took place between Mr. Squire, H.M„ Consul, and Vice Consul, the Consular and Area Liaison Officers, and Messrs Gass and Luard of the Anglo-Xranian Oil Company before Mr. Squire 1 s interviews with K,E. the Minister of...the Interior and the Ustandar. In spite of abortive attempts on the part of the Minister to show that the scheme for acquiring land lords' surpluses was inapplicable to Khuzistan, it was decided to press forward energetically with the existing scheme even if the price offered by the Government had to be raised. On 25th July instructions were received but never carried out that the price of wheat supplied to the bakers was to be increased from Rials 1202 to Rials 2153 per ton, with the fixed retail price of bread with 25?' barley at Rials 5.per 3 kiloso The collection of wheat surpluses in the meantime had been proceeding unsatisfactorily except in Ram Hormuz where the local Director of Finance had seized by force the merchants' considerable stocks and placed on them n that the stocks seized included their legal 'personal requirements' or seed corn. Elsewhere, the amounts collected were merely stocks extorted from Arabs with the Amnieh’s customary brutality and dishonesty (reports have even been received of Arabs under duress buying wheat on the black market to satisfy the Amnieh 5 s demands) or the result of face saving gestures by the smaller merchants. onus of showing depend on (b) The success of the whole scheme seemed likely to a o 11 c n g a k: e n a. ga i n o i •-w:*. T-v, giar, the leading landlord of the province who is de facto responsible for the Security of the area bordering on Kuhgalu. Previous in formation had shown him to be in possession of some thousands of tons of surplus wheat. The Minister of the Interior, after an interview with Rais~ut-Tu t jar, expressed himself 'satisfied*' that Rais-ut-Tujjar jjossessed only 200 tons surplus. Cleardy, if the most prominent land-owners in the province were allowed to evade the law &amp;e a result of satisfying the Minister, minor land-owners would evade their obligations by satisfying lesser officials. On 26th July, accordingly, the Governor-General accompanied by Mr. Le Page, set off for Behbehan to ascertain tthe truth about Rais-ut-Tujjar'a stocks. The Governor-General was there apparently so intimidated by his surroundings that he accepted the land-owners terms; Rais-ut-Tujjar was to make ever at the Government price not even the 200 tons oi which he satisfied the Minister of the Interior, but about 80 tons of grain which was about a third of the amount Required by the military garrison at Behbehan; the town was to be _supplied with wheat bought in the free market and Rais-ut- Tu c 7 jar was virtually left free to dispose of his surpluses at something about twice the Government rate. This development was being discussed in Tehran at th e end of the month. (c; At the end of the month it was decided that wheat should be sold to the Ahwaz bakers at Rials 1650 per ton, half the amount required to be supplied by the Economic Department, and half to be bought by the bakers on the free market. A scheme is also under consideration for the establishment of a central bakery with a capital of Rials 400 ,000 of which a quarter will be subscribed by the i&amp;mieipality. 5.

The Commission under Dr, Lutfi is enquiring into an incident (paragraph 3 of our last fortnightly diary refers) of last March when Sartip Zarrabi is alleged to have had foux 1 Arab Sheikhs near Dizful invited to a feast and there to have murdered them, A compromise is being sought: Sartip Zarrabi claims that the murder was necessary to preserve order in the area and Tabal, the brother of one of the murdered Sheikhs, is being offered the headship of his tribe. Dr, Lutfi in the meantime has approached this Consulate unofficially for its version of the incident’«. A report has been received that Sarhang Mohajir, head of uhe Amnieh in Khuaistan, is to be replaced by Sarhang Siahpush, Sarhang Mohaiir has held the post for six months and during that time has successfully avoided attracting notice. The recent excesses of the Amnieh who are collecting wheat from the north of Ahwaz coincide with news of Sarhang MohaJir's transfer, 7, Security , Complaints have been received of the increase of thefts of military equipment and other articles from military personnel in and around Andimeshk. Apprehension is apparently felt in Bahbehan for security when the Kuhgilg tribes move down from' their summer quarters* A number of minor incidents have taken place along the line of the foothills all through the summer which demons trate the Persian Government’s lack of control in the area. The Governor-General claims that his transactions with Rais-ut- Tujjar in Behbehan will maintain security in the area as freeing the market there will bring out wheat from the Kuhgilu and bring prosperity and therefore peace to the Kuhgilu, The Governor-General is at any rate satisfied that unless Rais-ut-Tujjar’s active support can be retained, there is no prospect of avoiding serious trouble from the Kuhgilu in the autumn. 8. Russian Interests, informed His Majesty^ Consulate of an incident on 31st July of which he took a most serious view, Ras-ud-Ban Qarib, a Persian police officer employed at the jail, was asked co pay for a ticket at the Cinema pars where a Soviet film was being exhibited showing the defeat of the Germans in 1918, The Officer made a scene, shouted that he would not pay to see films of this kind and that the time was soon coming when such films would not be shown in Ahwaz at all He then arrested the manager. An enquiry is being conducted by the Commissioner of Police for Khusistan and it will be interesting to see how the exhortations of the Central Police Administration are interpreted in practise.

The Governor General inspected work cn the Andiraeshk road on 11th August, Sarhang Saqafi, Director of the Railway Depart ment, went to Tehran on leave on 11th August. 3 c Wheat - In spite of the execution on 6 th August of d the order that bakers should draw on the free market for half their supplies, the bread situation in the towns remains exti*emely unsatisfactory, with discrimination being exercised against persons supplying food to labour connected with the . war effort. On the 1st August, for example, the bakery pro viding bread for the railway labour was shut down by Municipal officials on the pretext that no baking had been done. The facts appear to have been that the miller .had been late with the flour on the previous night. Representations secured the reopening of the shop pending investigations but on 3rd August the Municipality returned to the attack. The baker was not_ supplied with flour, this time on the pretext that ms bread was unsatisfactory in quality. It then became clear that the bak§r had rashly refused to ‘’subscribe ’ 1 tc the projected Municipal Bakery Company, further representations have stepped the discrimination for the present. A further example occurred in connection with the supplies for the labour at Bandar Shahpur, On 3rd August Ahwaz ran out of wheat entirely and none could be sent tc Bandar Shahpur. Twenty-four tons were collected by evening, fifteen tons of which was to be kept for Ahwaz, seven tons for the Persian garrison and two tons as reserve but none for Bandar Shahpur It was only with the greatest unwillingness that the Governor-General finally agreed to make over half the Persian military supplies for the port labour. The Governor-General's weakness in dealing with ut-Tujjar (para 4 (b) of this Consulate's last fortnightly refers^is seriously affecting the collection of surpluses k:- rfj*' /&lt;W ^ fa TV y fc Ms. /throughput-2 $ throughout the province» Under the erd Interior, half a dozen leading hoarders &lt;&amp;) to have been imprisoned :&gt;f the Minister of Distill are reported After hearing of the Eals-ut'-TU] t iai incident, they settled down comfortably and were released after twenty*-five days without producing any wheat. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s return into ohe wheat market is producing curious results, A rumour that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company were buying wheat reached Dizful on ?'th August and sent up the price of wheat from Rials 4,000 to Rials 4,300 a ton. Eight merchants immediately tried to comer all available wheat. Their rivals then started rumours in the town that the eight merchants were buying the wheat for export to the British forces and a riot was speedily produced in the course of which Afsharin, one of the eight, was severely handled and his house broken into. He was taken into prove ctive custody by the police. The Agricultural Syndicate’s installation at Hamid ieh was inspected by Lie a si’s Le page and Bussey of the Ailglo-1 rani an 011 Company on 11th August, m he machinery, which was reported to bo in surprisingly- good condition, consists of American, Russian and German units; thn units are out German local re-Dcr oi commission work has been lack of s direction jcurity in the area and the absence for the last six months has more or the syndicate. spares.

The host's behaviour caused considerable heart ••'burning. Apparently the Governoi'-Geneml^ on arrival failed to shake hands with his guests and wento deliver a homily or. the food situation, for which he Ul-omed the inefficiency of officials. He then proceeded to cross -examine the Cffloor Commanding .Annien about the alleged lack of security at Dasht~i--rlishan and was very pi'operly informed cf son© of the facts of the situation. it may therefore be the Gcvernor-General’’s tact lessness that is producing a cron of reports alleging that the G-ovarnor-'G-enaral has started to extort bribes or. a large scale- chiefly through the Director of the Municipality, With wheat on the free market selling between Rials. 4,500 and Rials 5,000 a ton and bread at Rials 3.50 for three kilos, a baker has a. margin of about Ria?vS 635 per ton, but this can easily be doubled by tne use of false weights and adulterated flour. It is reported that the sixty odd bakers of -.he town have been obligee to pay Rials 200 each to the Director of the Municipality. Similar demands are reported to have been made from the butchers; they, however, were unable tc satisfy the Director and six butchers' shops were closed down on the following day 0 it is aj.so stated that the Governor-General takes twenty to thirty tomans for the recommendation of a is further reported to have by British forces, Contractor to the Americans and h Summoned the contra tors employ The attempt to establish a rule of law in Iran xlae interesting repercussions.

Security In spite of somewhat alarmist rumours the ICugilu are at present quiet. The situation at Gaeh Saran has heen described separately. Opinion is, however, almost unanimous that six weeks hence when the tribes move down from their summer quarters will be a time of considerable anxiety,'*' The Arab villages on the left bank of the Tfarun, north of Ahwaz, have put in a series of complaints in the last fortnight about the raids of the right-bank Chananeh Arabs from the direction of Dizful. Mullasani village was raided, for example, on the nights of the 1 . 1 th, 12 th,’ and ,13th August. The Chananeh Arabs have, it is true, always raided the unarmed villages of the left bank, but recently the robberies have so increased that the smaller villages are being abandoned and it appears likely that the Chananeh will become a serious threat, it they are unchecked., to any lines of communication the British authorities may wish to develop on the right bank, 6 - British and Aliied go rc Ahwaz is experiencing the worst summer for seven years and high temperatures combined with high humidities are producing very large numbers of cases of heat exhaustion and heat stroke among British ranks.

The majority, it is to be feared, would now show a^mes c the same indifference to any change of regime as thev did. in Augusc, -941. There has, however, been a crop of resignations from superior Iranian employees of the Anglo- Iranian O.i.l Company which are hard to interpret except as an attempt to leave what is imagined to be a sinking ship.

Wheat The Persian authorities have now abandoned all pretence at controlling or guaranteeing the supply of wheat \0 the towns. At a commission held on 1 st September, the Director of l^inance announced that he could no longer supnly Vheat at the Government rate and proposed that the town bakers Should obtain the whole of their supplies on the gree market. The other officials objected on the grounds that such a course tfculd enormously increase the cost of living. The Commissioner cf Police who was apparently under the impression that his personal influence could procure a loan of wheat from the British forces or the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company then offered to provide fifty tons if the Director cf Finance would guarantee repayment in ten days; the Director not unnaturally refused. The Commission finally decided that the Governor General should go to Tehran and endeavour tc obtain manna from the hills. n n instructions Tehran, copie should obtain also exhorted wheat as well amounts so co though the o Armieh, were th September the Director of Finance received from the Director General of Food Supplies at d to the Governor General, that the town bakers ■all their supplies on the free market.

The laeotect were to be stored against a rainy day merit demands of the Persian forces, military and to met therefrom. Ihe town bakers were summoned to hear of the decision oa the following day and were told that they ware to sell at Rials 6 * 60 per kilo. They replied that they were unable to do sc as they had tc buy at Rials 7000/- per metric ton and about thirty bakers are reported to have closed down. Other shops have opened up and as the result cf attempt at centre 1 bread is now sold at JRials 10 per kilo, (When the town bakers received vhe whole of their supplies from the Finance Department bi’ead cost Rials I.50 per kilo and when they received half, Rials 2.36 per kilo). The distress of the poorer classes can be inferred from the figures. On 9th September the Governor General received a telegram from the Prime Minister stating that the Governor General would himself supervise the food situation and would be personally rewpoasibla for all issue of wheat and ether foodstuffs from Government stocks. 5.

The three Sheikhs faiieo. to pay promptly and, understanding that the military governor was looking for an excuse to arrest them, made? a compact to resist ail robbers.

G. Tribal Affairs . Vague and unconfirmed reports in regard to the general tribal situation have reached His Majesty's Consulate-General from several sources. It is alleged that several officers of rank in the Persian army have entered into a conspiracy with various tribal leaders to occupy the pri ncipal towns in . event of the situation in the Caucasus seriously deteriorating* disarm the Persian forces* and presumably disrupt the British lines of communication. The conspiracy is said to centre in Tehran where the tribal side is directed by Amir -Jang, Nasir Khan Qashgai is reported to be the channel of communication with the Kuhgilu and Qashgai tribes* and Abel Qassem and Manuchehr Khan with the Bakhtiaris. mhtse sensational reports are naturally treated with extreme reserve* but they provide an interesting indication of Persian opinion with respect to the Government ; s tribal policy and its effectiveness. Parajullah Khan Kayan Chahar]ang* who made peace with the Persian authorities some four months ago saw His Majesty s Vice-Consul in company with Haider Khan Bahmai. Haider Khan is the brother of the outlaw Abbas Quli Bahmai whose sister Parajullah married. They purport to have come to arrange tke terms of Abbas Quit’s submission to the Persian authorities. Farajullah reported that he would shortly be accompanying a detachment of one company of Persian troops to the Kuhgilu where Sartip Zarrabi proposed taking action against the Mohammed Mousa’eo and Mohammed sec cions of the Bahmai east of Ram Hormuz and against the Mir Ahmedi, Nim Tola and Qanbar sections around Izeh (Maiamir). This choice of opponents is apparently calculated tc give Zarrabi some easy successes on the one hand and Farajullah T s faction an opportunity of working off some old tribal scores on the other. In the southern Kuhgilu apprehension continues to grow as the 3cin Ahmedis approach and no action appears to be taken to strengthen the Persian forces in the Behbehan district. The Boir .Ahmedis’ latest exploit was to hold up and plunder in broad daylight on the plain not six miles from Behbehan the lorry carrying the Persian post, passengers and piece goods. The disconcdrting feature of the incident is that the Boir • hmedis normally confine their outrages tc hilly/ partsof the road south east of Behbehan but have now penetrated to the easier country on the north west in the direction of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company 5 s new operations. Meanwhile the Persian military commander's overtures to Abdullah Khan Zarghampur, at present the most dangerous oft he Kuhgilu ^ chieftains, seem to be making little headway as the result of a well founded mutual distrust. An ill-advised departure by the Gendarmerie from Sartip Zarrabi’s policy of non-intervention (para 8 of Ahwaz diary for the 15th to 31st August 1942 refers) almost ruptured the peace of Su sang ire!, The Officer Commanding Gendarmerie, hearing seme shots fired during a wedding ceremony, went to the house of Sheikh Saddam and demanded the surrender of the rifles. He also sent post haste for reinforcements from Ahwaz. Fortunately the military governor succeeded in settling the case before their arrlvaloIn the Arah areas north of Ahwaz security continues to deteriorate, mainly at the expense of the more peaoah.ie 2 Ara'b V illages, On 14th September a party of Chananeh Arabs raided Seyed Hassan (near Ahu Desht) and after killing two- persons and wounding three others drove off about 250 head of cattle. On 16th September a party of unidentifled raiders attacked Aidan near Qaleh Shehr (H-59A 5074) and took away several sheep with the loss of one of their gang. On 18th September a small gang raided the camp of one of the sub contractors of the Andimishk road construction party and took away sorng .food and clothing; local Arabs with grievances againstysub'contractor are suspected. The Persian military commander proposed to General Shaqaqi a disarmament expedition while the Arabs were more less immobilised by their unreaped rice crops; it would seem more profitable to evryone else that his at present meagre forces should be used in defending the vital rice crops near Biz fill or in alleviating the insecurity of the Gach Saran read. No orders in this connection have sc far been received from Tehran, 7, Russian Interests. The Soviet Consul in a recent interview with His Majesty's Consul-General expressed anxiety for the security of the railway bridge over the'Karun and the new pier at Bandar Shahpur, The new pier is reported by the British military authorities to be under the protection of a guard on the old pier some thirty feet from the new one, A guard is understood to have been provided for the railway bridge, but the local British military authorities have great difficulty in finding fighting (as opposed to technical) personnel, (para 22 of Ahwaz diary for February 1942 refers) 3. Rumours and Public Op in ion- A party of labourers employed by the British forces a short distance outside Ahwaz were brought m for a bathing parade; Ahwaz town was firmly convinced that they were being conscripted for operations on the Russian fromt. Although the Rome and Berlin'broadcasts in Persian have been audible cn several occasions, local opinion remains remarkably apathetic to the developments in tne Cavor no.-. The dropping of Gorman pamphlets in the north and the departure of American families from Tehran - cither circumstance would have -—j-'-- have caused little caused wide spread panic lo ca 1 c cmmenb, twelve months ago Sd.

Yelkend jogiou returned * Kho r reuashahr where had gone on business and is understood to have left for Tehran to answer the charges against him 4. Local Politics In the absence of the Governor—General and as the result of general inactivity at the end of Ramazan, there ban been little cf interest. With the departure cf Rais-ut-Tujjar to Tehran (vide para 4 of Ahwaz diary for 15th-30th September) Wt is felt locally that either the Governor-General will be ■forced to share his takings or alternatively Rais-ut-Tujjar will get a ’'fair'' trial and be acquitted for lack of evidence. In messages sent to his friends Rais-ut-Tuj.jar has advised them not to be depressed and reminds them that he normally spends at few weeks at this time in Tehran in any event. Ramazan has been observed in a variety of ways* Although the tea shops have theoretically remained open during the day for the use of travellers and foreigners only ; they have been widely, if discreetly, used by their normal clientele during the hours of the fast. Pew of the Persian officials have made any attempt to keep the Rcza, On 1st October; on the other hand, a considerable section cf the poorer townspeople; departing from the customs which prevailed even before the late regime put an end to religious demonstrations; decided to take out a religious procession., 'he police attempted to disperse the procession and were in danger cf being overwhelmed when a British soldier 7/ho had been held up in the crowd fired a few rounds into the nearest mud wall. This action dispersed the crowd. A certain amount of resentment continued in the area and number of cars, some of which contained British Officers returning from the Cinema, were rather half-heartedly stoned. The demonstration, such as it was. was not apparently directed against the British but against *ny car that'passed. 5. Food Supplies .

Competition among the bakers appears to have improved the quality,-but the price remains fantastically high for those classes which have not directly benefitted by the general rise in prices, Tho butchers of the town, apparently secured by the knowledge of the douceurs paid to the Director of the Municipality (para 6 of Ahwaz diary for 15th-31st August refers and anxious to take advantage of the rise in prices following large-scale purchases of sheep by the British forces, applied for permission to sell common meat at 15 Rials ner kilo* (The corresponding price in September 1941 was 5.-50 Rials and in September 1942 £ Rials,) Permission was refused^and the butchers had a day's strike before they compromised or D Rials rer kilo v111. a ge, about 1 2 ii tribesmen who that two o-p 6.

Tight cases were recovered from the cave on the arrival cf the Amnieh some four hours later. Some of the articles have been traced to the hills north east of Behbehan and others are reported to be at Zaidan twenty miles in the opposite direction. There is little doubt that the gang had previous information about the lorry and its load, and the whole scheme was boldly conceived and well executed.

The birthday of His Imperial Majesty the Shah was celebrated by a series of receptions. In the morning the Governor-General invited to his house His majesty's ocnsul- General and Oice-Consul, the A L.O., the three British Brigadiers, the Soviet Consul, the heads of the Amercan Mission, the European heads of the Imperial Bank of Iran and ihe Anglo- Iranian Oil Company, and a few leading Iranian officials. In the afternoon the Education Department held a reception to /which3 which no foreigners were invited. In the evening, the Governor- General gave a large party at the Persian Officers’ club to w*j.~ch. all British Officers of field rank and above were invited au.A the categories of guests at the morning party were similarly expanded. His idajesty’s Consul-General proposed the health of h-S xmperial iviajesty the Chah and the Governor—General replied. The general atmosphere was noticeably more friendly than at the celebrations of 1941. The arrest of Rais-ut—Tuihas been having intersting ^ocal repercussions. Behbehan was fjrfcmeriy the friendliest town ' in Khuzistan and was rightly noted for the excellent treatment given to the arrested Europeans of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company pr:or to the entry of the British troops a year ago. A British Officer who recently visited Behbehan in connection with fodder contracts was made the object of an apparently spontaneous demonstration and his car stoned. ^he Rais-ut-^ujjar family did not. of course, fail to give the officer customary hospitality. 6. Rood Supplies. The wheat situation remains virtually unaltered as the increased prices at which the Iranian Government is now willing j to buy are ab*&gt;ut half the rate prevailing on the local black market. ^ It appears also that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's s.heme tor purchasinf wheat on behalf of the Iranian authorities i5 meeting with only slight success. The general difficulbias °t fv 16 J ranian authorities here can be gauged from a statement oi the Governor-General's to t ic effect that wheat for the Persian lorces in Khuzistan is 'being sent from Tehran. The rice crop in Khuzistan which should be in within ^h- next month is reported to be a bumper one. The finance be jar tment have apparently not yet received instructions to acquire the crop, though this is not a matter of the first importance as rice is eaten by the middle rather than the labouring classes*It is reported that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Ccmpany has in the meantime acciuiPsd a very considerable portion o. the Khuzistan crop. The price has doubled within the fortnight u.Iier review in some parts of the district. rn he crop prospects for the coming winter have been improved by early rains: 38 ,; were recorded in Ahwaz on 21st October and 1 32 K on 30th October, The area affected on the le£o bank of the Karun is, however, small and according to repox-ts so far received is confined to a circle some thirty miles in diameter in which little daim cultivation ordinarily takes place 6. rribal, Kith reference to para 6 of Ahwaz diary for the first ha^f of October, three Quarters of the property stolen in the )hold-up of 7th October has now been recovered. Right members of the gang are also supposed to have been apprehended, and Colonel Zarrabi proposes to hang on the scene of the crime three of them vyho ; vere found to be in possession of arms. These three are inhabitants of Chams-i-Siyah - commonly known as Marun village - wnijh provided tufangchis for the protection of the Eehbehan road. a T .October a gang now alleged to have been composed Cx the i/iirza Ali section of the Boir Ahmed GannsiriS; committed ^he most serious offence of the year on the read six miles on the Anwaz sice of Behbehan. Six Anglo-Iranian Oil Company vehic3.es were held up_at various times during the day and looted and three Jlurr.peans, along with the other occupants of the vehicles were taken into custody and not released until the evening. All the capti/es sta^e thft the operation was carried out with gre; t efficiency and the tactics of the gang conformed to the accepted canons of mountain warfare. On the same evening an unidentified /gangA gang raided the Anglo-Iranian )il Cocnpany telephone house at mile 27 of the pipe-line, some ten miles south of the Behhehan road. Colonel Zarrahi has placed responsibility for the major offence on Abdulla Khan Zargharnpur (vide para 6 of Ahwa z diary for 15th - 30tn September) who has apparently been impressed by the Persian reinforcements of Behbehan and has reopened negotiations with the Colonel * The surrender of the culprits and the return of the stolen property has been made a condition precedent to further discussions. The long awaited reinforcements for the Behbehan garrison arrived in Ahwaz on 16th and 17th October and as the Persian authorities were unable to provide vehicles were ferried to Behbehan in ten lorries provided by the British Military authorities. In conversations with his Majesoy Consul-General, Colonel Zarrabi had revealed that he intended tc use his troops in operations against the tribes rather than in protecting the road which is unquestionably the main British interest in the area, and in spite of representations urging the necessity of restoring security on the road has at the end of the month not moved his trooos out of Behbehan. ''he contribution of Colonel Pur-i-Hastegar to the problem has been to ’'reoccupy'* three of the ahandon%ed gendarmerie posts on the Gach Paran road with twenty-eight men who will be lucky to^ retain their rifles until the arrival of regular ililitary forces. In ohe meantime a confused shooting affray at Fasanun on the night of 22nd October together with the general local appre hension has caused considerable numbers of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company staff to desert their work at Pazanun which is of major importance to the war effort. Further representations are being made, however, and a promise has been given to estaolish Persian military camps at various points on the road within the week. The sheikhs of the Beni Turuf (vide para 6 of Ahwaz diary for 1st - 15th October) have brought in the sheikhs of the Chenar.eh, Xhasraj and Bet Rashid sections for conversations with Colonel Zarrabi. n he Colonel's hand had been strengthened by the (to the British authorities, unexpected) arrival in Dizful of a battallion of infantry together with a mountain battery and one or two squadrons of cavalry, and he demanded^ from the sheikhs the return of certain stolen property and the surrender of a quantity of arms. He apparently proposes to take a cciumn into the Karkheh and idianab areas to enforce his demands. All three sections are notorious raiders and a scurse of serious trouble to the villages on the left bank and the Dizful-Shushtar area; up tc the present, however, they have caused no trouble to the British lines of communication and a Persian column .n their area might have serious consequences. Parajuilah Khan Kayan (vide para 6 of Ahwaz diary^for 15-C0th September) is becoming so unpopular that it seems unli kely he will prove of much use to the Persian authorities as unoi'icial military governor of the Janiki area. He has now quarrelled with Mahmood Khan Chabarlang, and the military governor of the Bakhtiari is unable tc recover the arms made over to i/.ahmcod Khan for maintaining security in the Dalun area. 7. Communications - The /uiglo-Iranian Oil Company’s port installation for^ the loading of tankers at Bandar Mashur has now been commissioned. The two first tankers were loaded and cleared in the period under review. Ahwaz, 4th November 1942- Sgd. A.E.H. MACANN H« iAr 0 ON SUL - GNN ORAL.mmmmm CONFIDSNTIAL Notes for Registry.

Tribal . With reference to para 6 of the Ahwaz diary for 15th -31st October, the arrival of Persian reinforcements at Behbehan appears to have had a salutary effect; there have been nc incidents on the Gach Saran road during the fortnight and xhere I has been a general increase of confidence. Six new gendarmerie posts for the protection of the road have been sited and rlans considered for the repair of four existing posts. The sixes of two xamps for road-protection troops have also been fixed. The Persian military authorities, however, show a profound rsluctanc to occupy these camps and, although orders were given fo? their immediate occupation in the presence of the A.L.O. in the first week of the month, the forces had not moved out of Behbehan by 14th November. m he A.L.O., however, is visiting the ares and immediate results are expected. The negotiations between Colonel Zarrabi, the Officer /Commanding3 ?hH^fi n L PerSian tro °P s ’ and Abdullah Khan Zarghampur continue Abdullah Khan is reported to have stated that he has nineteen persons under his control involved in the hold-up of the i J c+£^z? nS ° n (viie nara 6 of Ahw«.z diary for oth-31st October) whom he will hand over to Colonel Zarrabi. Colonel Zarrabi has also demanded the return of automatic and other weapons which Abdullah Khan acquired from the 'Persian forces and seems surprisingly confident that his demands will be met. ^ ar&gt; ^shnri section of the Qashgai, who are apparently held responsible for the clash with the Aersian forces'at a am i iruz, ar,e now in Bavi territory, and Colonel Zarrabi’s captprpd d pt n vnr n ^ i0n ° f Securinr the return Persian arms captured at Kamfiruz is proaucing the usual hectic intrigues in the Kuhgilu.

(See para 6 of Ahwaz Diary fo? the 15tn t® 31st Octcher 1542). * (15) The Governor-General went to Xhorramshahr and Ahadan on 17th Decernber and returned on the 22nd, (16) With reference to para 3 «f Ahwaz Diary f»r the first- half of Decemberj Sarhstng Ishci. Officer Commanding of r;ndRmerie in Khuzistan, returned to Ahwaz on 31st December, IV. liJconemic Situation, (17) Although there have been no maj®r changes in the n“ , 3.ce.s ef staple foodstuffs, the general rise in prices continues. Bazar butter, which at the beginning of December c®st 1: Hi*ls a Lb , has n«w reached 30 Rials and meat becomes scaror 1 ; firewood, which a year ag® c#st ®ne Rial f®r ten kilce is n»w a rial and a (|uarter for one kil®. er ig propose to pay the agreed price of Rials 5,000 per -’or thar quantity f At the suggestion, of His Majesty’s Consul-r neral, they are reported, however asking the Governor-Genere. for a list of the stocks in Dizfu.1 with a view to obtaining he balance of their requirements at the Go^erncr--General’s pric^ «f Rials 2,500. (19) V/idespread and timely rains have improved the rr spacts for the next harvest, but the distribution of the l,4|:$tons cf seed wheat allotted to Khuzistan of which 1,850 t®ns have so far arrived proceeds slowly in spite of the efforts of this Consulate-Ceneral tc hasten matters, Less than this has been sent to the various centres, while much less ce: iave actually reached the cultivators. Hamidieh reckon tirrc is only a fortnight more in which grain can profitably be £o\vt\« The Persian authorities lack any revenue records which wofid enable them to distribute the wheat to the carts where it v-ov.d give the best return and the corruption of the minor officals tends to divert the seed tc the highest bidder. The cultivtors, on the other hand, have made little or no attempt to Repay their last year’s loans of seed and some at least ar° concc-’ied chief ly to get hold of cheap wheat which they can sell at in immediate and considerable profit. (The Governor-General infeyed His i/Iajesty’s Consul-General that he had ordered the publ.c flogging of *-ne Arab cultivator who was caught red -handed sel'i.ng in the bazaar five bags of seed-wheat he had just received fora the Persian authorities.) (2®) Jf the numerous scandals connected with the distribution of seed the most noteworthy has been the transaction kith Hedayatullah Kaiantari of Phushtar. He is reported t&lt; have paid the regulation douceur of Rials 500 for his seed whoa* and gene off with considerable elati®n, since he had an order .'or tens, to the ' rinancs Department. A petty official ther^ refused to give him more than half the amount, apparently on the pretext that Hedayotullah had to pay a further sum of Rials S,000 to the Ustandari. The landlord then returned to the Ustaniiri with Agha Nasseri, the local Deputy of the Majlis, whom re had found with the head of the Pinance Department. The Kalarfary family had suffered severely as a result of not paying sufficient to avoid chargee of hoarding and it appears tin t Heiiyatullah' s complaints were sufficiently outspoken to cause one cf the Governor-General’s ’characteristic rages’’. The Governor-fener&amp;l is reported to have vowed tc send the landlord and 'he twomembers of the Commission supervising the distribution ofj th^- seed to Court. discretion, however, unhappily sunervenad. and Hedyatullah received the balance of his seed without hsving to uiake any extra payment. V . Loc al_ _Pol i t i c_s. (21) m he promotion of 0 artip 'arrobi to the 'Ihorramatad command and the appointment of °artio dumayun to the Khuzistan command are locally interpreted as triumphs for fipahdod Chahba’chti, whose alleged anti-British and anti-Arab policy both officers are supposed to have carried on faithfully, if discreetly. (Compare para 3 of Ahwaz Diary for the 1st to 15th July 194o) It seems however that of recent months fartip Zarrabi has thought it wiser to cooperate with us and to follow our more moderate Arab policy. ^he same fear of the revival of the nhahbakhoi regime is seen in gloomy forecasts for the successor to t present Governor-General who is popularly supposed to ie aiomt to be replaced: Sartip Ta.jbakhsh, who was at first the strongest Candidate, has now been replaced in popular favour by Garlashkar iJu’ini; no authority is claimed for either forecast, &amp;ut coth are symptomatic of popular hopes and fears. (22) Ahwaz is reported t« have ac%Ui.red the reputation t&gt;f ceing the most profitable town in Persia for begrars and since the beginning of the cold weather has suiiered a remarkable invasion. By the beginning of December the iiercantile coirununit./ under one Kommeli had collected Dials 70,000 and had established a poor- h«u*je capable of housing 270 persons: the institution was to be maintained by ordinary subscriptions and a ‘voluntary' levy •f Rials 50 on every truck-load of goods leaving f«r Tehran. Hie iJlajesty’s Consul-General had inspected the institution with a view to discovering .if it was a suitable object for he_p from the Anglo-Iranian Pel^f ihind and was informed by the Governor- General that he (Divanbegi) had the personal authority of the Ohah to expand the institution. Colonel Alborz, Commissioner of Police for Khuzistan, and Agha Nasseri, the local Deputy to the Majlis, frankly express the greatest anxiety that the standard should be kept out of the scheme cn the grounds th&amp;t ios aim is to succour the p®or rather than enrich the already rirb. Agha Nasseri, v^ho contemplates an institution outside the rewn ad ministered by a body containing allied representative? and capable of housing at a cost of Rials 20,#00 a month aJ. the indigent of the town, also claims to have a written authority from r 'ehran t® go ahead with his scheme. (23) With reference to para 5 of Ahwaz Diary for 15th _ .o 30 th November, the Hezb-i-Azadegan’s first attempt at eiuiating public opinion appears to have miscarried. Various stuients were apparently asked to collect copies of the classi.-a_ poets and religious commentaries for destruction. The matter was brought to the notice of the Police who, with .the assistance of the Director of Education, put a st®p to this policy. VI. Tribal. (24) With reference to para 6 of Ahwaz Diary fer 1st ~o 15th December, it is reported that Abdullah 'Chan Zarghampur. in addition to surrendering a machine-gun, has sent his step brother to Behbahan as a security for his good behaviour. 25 (25) With reference to para 6 of Ahwaz Diary of 15th ro 30th September, Farajullah Khan produced with some pride tc riis x/Iajesty's Vice Consul a letter from Sartip Zarrabi bidding Parajullah to Ahwaz with all speed to discuss taking over the bakhshdari of Janiki. Sartip Zarrabi was engaged with his Marshall at the time of the interview and i s far as is known left for Khorramabad without seeing Parajullah. 'arajullchf s failure to control the Behmai faction who are apoosed to his brother-in-law is apparently encouraging him to seek co reestablishV v \ -4- hie connections with the Bi itish fmthorities m case Colonel i.arral'i’s successor should judge too strictly by results, (26) An unconfirmed reuort from kam lor muz states thr.tAbul Oasim Khan (see oar a ^ of ..hwaz hiary for let to 15th Agust) kxp-ILL ID the Bakhshdar of Bakhtiarwand, (2?) /■ blight on &lt; corns is reported from the northern Kuhgilu area, (-’lour uiaie fro t n acorns is a staple food of the poorer tribes cf rhe area,) VII. Arabs* (26) The fortnight under review has been in Arab eyes unfavour able. It now seems clear that they had ho )ed that the British determination to prevent any action that wo &lt;ld involve gratuitous danger tc the allied lines of communication would involve the Persian forces in complete inactivity. Jur support cf the Persian authorities’ very reasonable demand for the surrender of illicit arms fey admittedly turbulent outlaws was naturally not to the Arabs’ liking. The 'isit of marshall Shar.sakhti recalled unpleasant memories and the fact that the s^eA wheat, though imported by the British, was being distributee fey the Persians was aiso unpalatable. Jne or two half-heai tmd attempts were therefore made to bluff the British authorities fey sugges tions of the possibility of disorder. A party of Bav: sheikhs who had not received all the seed wheat they desired stated that they had been assured by the head of the finance Department that the distribution was the responsibility of the Britisi. .hen they were informed that this was not the case, they threatened to produce a feigner and better version of the Tehran riots. Informed of the results of any such action, they wen' away quietly. Similarly two sheikhs of the Beni Turuf ststea that although they would continue te do every'hing in the :r oov/er to maintain order on the British lines of communication, it war only because of a large number of their young men getting_ employment and food from the British authorities that their efforts had been so far successful and they could on^y hooe to remain successful if the British authorities helped item with seed corn. ^hey too were reminded of the responsibilities involved in their privileges as Phaikhs, (25) v.'ith reference to para ^ of Ahwaz liary for 1st to 15th December, it is reported from rab sources that the car on the cultivation «f rice land at Busangird has not been retrieved, though f ecret ‘Preparations for cultivation are admitteiiy being made.’ rn bis is'alleged to be possible because neither -he Persian military garrison nor the fendarnerie move sut of the trwn. ^he Persian authorities in Ahwaz repeat, however, that orders have been issued to remove the ban.

Formerly employed ®y Kampzax, he now works ler Alf Berpan contractor an*i had come on his business. V. Economic \2i) The prices of wheat and rice show a very slight tendency to tall. In the absence of any large scale purchases in 'he area, where is no firm ruling rate but the fact of a slight i‘ r &lt;ll seems Indisputable. ^he fall in the price of wheat is attributed to two groups of factors; the first is the sale of Goverr.rr.ent by cultivators (the amount involved might seem to 8c seed wheat eoo small to affect the general price level Vut the reduction cf the quantity «f wheat supplied tc the town bakers - 21 tons in Janqary 1942 as against 5 tons in January 1943 - as the result cf Persian authorities feeding their own officials and fnc British mi-itary its mm labour should be born in mind) ; the second srtup of factors depends on circumstances making f«r *piimism in regard to this year's wheat crop - timely and sufficient rain, a distribution of seed wheat fairly generous in view of existing stocks, and a general feeling of hope in regard to the wicer issues of the war. v^lj H. M. Consul-General and /ice Consul made rapid tcurs to acquire a general iu'ipression of the quantity of wheat sown. In jli.uzistan as a v/h»le it appears that sowings in the irrigated areas were slightly larger than last year, though sowi.igs on ur.irrigated lands appeardt to be less. The speed at which Government seed has been distributed to outlying centres and planted shows considerable variation throughout the discrict; 'here seems, however, to be no ground for apprehension that the Government seed wheat will not be sown in time. v 82) According to the military authorities about 1#0C sheep or gtats T:r ill be required daiij to meet consumption*the areas ®f Ahwaz, Khorramshahr, Abadan and Andimeshk. The Furchsse Officer seems convinced that by purchasing, direct from the owners and sc cutting out the middlemen he will be able to reduce the price wnich according to him had been unnecessarily increased during :he last 6 months by the inflated prices paid in Basra and o or.s equen11y in Abad an, ^2:3) Pith reference to para 1§ of ilawaz Diary for the second half of Decern)er, further particulars have been obtained about 'he transactions over the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. rice in Dizful, n lie two leading land omiers reported that the wnglo--Iranian Oil Co. has taken 300 tons of ric^ at the price originally agreed upon, but the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. was net getting and wouldnot get any rice at the O-overnor-Generai ! r price 8 According to them, the Governor-General had stated thrt he was reducing the price at the request of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co, who wished to avoid fulfilling their previous undertakings. According to the Anglo-Iranian Oil C# ; s local agent for the purchase of rice, the Governor-General has stated that if the Angle--I rani an )il Co. would leave the purchasing to the Governor-General he would save the Company considerable sums of money. Both sources give the impression that the Governor-General wished to corner the rice idrop and sell it to the Company on his own account. (24) A report has recently l»een received tnat the Iranian Govern ment proposes to Isuy up the rice crop from Dizful, Ramhorrr.oz and other centres in Khuzistan and expert it to the north. If this is done *&gt;n a. large scale the effect on the food position in Khuzistan rnay well be serious, (25) Locusts have appeared at Zaidun in the Behbahan area and are reported tc bgk laying eggs. The Governor-General who was given a precis of the locust forecast, has had tnis printed ani widely circulated and states that all possible measures are bei.ig taken to c® min at the locusts. The main gap in the Iranian authorities' equipment is transport. Bight British military lorries iave keen made available for their use as well as civilian drivers for the lorries. (The Persian authorities’ difficulty in fettir.g drivers is probably the result of the Agricultural Department’s bad reputation for unpunctuality over the payment of Mils), (26) Colonel Noel has introduced at Hamidieh farm the practice of dipping seed wheat in a solution of bitumen and kerosene oil. This renders wheat practically inedible and reduces theft zrA misuse of wheat given out for seed; although the reasor. for its use is iacally agreed t$ be the prevention of depredations »y Mrds »n newly-sown fields, (This is in fact true). E. U’s Consul-General urged the Governor-General to employ this method with the seed wheat from India but was resisted *n the ground of p®ssiMe adverse effects »n germination. This fear has beer proved te be groundless over many hundreds of areas at Hamiiieh and the idea has now been endorsed by the local Agricultural Department. 'Tie cost is not great and the practice might well be adapted widely in this country. V. Local Politics . (27) A certain amount of apprehension has Men caused among the more ®ld fashioned and consequently mere religious seed or. of the town and more particularly among the AraPs by the orders received from Tehran restricting public celebrations ir. Me ha ram* As was pointed out by a prominent Arab leader, practically the only tangible advantage gained by the common people frem the British 'occupation’ has been the extension of freedom ir. religious celebration. About the beginning of the monrh cf Moharam a communication was received from this leader ihat he had received orders from the Commissioner of Police ferbiemng Moharam prayers. On investigation it was found that orders hue in fact been received from Tehran forbidjnng public celebrations in the mosques and taking out processions in the streets. Permission has, however, been given by the C®mmissioner cf Police to half a dozen would-be celebrants to observe their festival on private precincts on condition they undertook not to contravene the orders received from Tehran. Last Moharam was something in the nature t&gt;f a demonstration against the old Shah's regime and some ptlicemen were roughly handled in the town. It was apprehended that this year as a result of the transfer of animus against the eld regime to the allies, demoastrations might conceivably be made against the allies and warnings were accordingly given tc British subjects and the Allied forces of the desirability of avoiding any processions or other demenstrations that may take place, British and American Forces have agreed to put Ahwaz Town prtrer #ut »f-5- secret protection of their telephone line) An arrangement haa ceen made whereby the Angloflranian Oil Company provider transport for the Gendarmerie in order that they may fuickly reach the scene of suspected thefts; disturbances indicating that thieves were trying to remove wire between Ahwaz and Kut-Abdullah were heard on the night of 9th January and the speedy arrival of Gendarmerie in the transport provided prevented any damage taking place. IX. British I'orces . (32) A telephone message was rec^ved on the evening of the 5th of January that rioting was taking place at the eastern erd of th Railway Bridge where the British troops were holding off the mob by armed forces. Information was quickly passed to tie' Iranian poling and military authorities. ''’he police late? stated that a quarrel had taken place between two Persian employees of Messrs. Poley Brothers and an Indian sentry which attracted a crowd; on the arrival of the A.L.O. on the scene' the riotous mob, which was considerably outnumbered by the Persian police and troops already »n the spot, was found t? ae m full flight having been menaced by an A.A, Guru (Bd) A V.

British Consulate-General, Ahwaz, 18th January, 1943.3 /'v of the province is estimated at , 00 # tons and its requirements at about 2C,0«« tons. ^he price of dates has already increased Tiy and will n# d^ulit d«uhle or treble itself as seon as expert is started »n a considerable scale. (25) On the occurrence «f a very sharp rise in commodity prices (e.g. tea frem Rials 57 to Rials per 1*. and sugar from 1/^ls 45 to Rials 7$ per kilt) His i-iajesty's Consul-General called ©n the Governor-General, the Director of Finance and the President • f the High Court to press for effective aotion under the Ar.ti- Hoardir.g i^aws and for the punishment of offenders. Hach authority in turn demonstrated «iuite plausibly that one or both of the others was to Islame. &gt;j.n allusion to the implications of the agreement between the United States, His Majesty’s Government and tho Iranian government regarding imports of grain appeared tc have some effect and the Governor-General called a meeting o:' the pood Supplies Commdission on the next working day and after a .. sessicn cf six hours various courses of action were decided u^on* the effecacy of which remains to lie seen. An immediate effect of th^ meeting alone was that the price of sugar fe&amp;l from Rials 7d to Rials 50. The President of the High Court explained the necessity for more judges regarding which a separate telegraphic reference has l»een made. V. Dotal Politics . (2S) With reference to para 27 of the last Ahwaz diary, some processions took place in defiance of the dan on Rauzeh. v /:.en the police attempted to disperse the crowds a disturbance tr^t plac* in the course pf which the police opened fire. A member of the trowd died as the result of wcunds received. A not very determined effort was made by the crowd before dispersal to enter His Majesty’s Consulate-General; the intention of the mob, according to a reliable sour”V5 who was outside the building, was to request the British authorities tc have the ban on Rauzer. /a rescinded or in the alternative to remove/government which le^l so fa? short of the British ideal of religious freedom. (27) Vith reference to para 7 of the last Ahwaz diary, Ghahr.e.ieh . Mo’ez: is reported tc have effected a reconciliation between the Govenor-General and the Commissioner ©f Police. Sarhang ^Ibcrz reports that he has received an apelagy from the Gavernor- Generil; certain ®f the Commissioner’s influential friends ir. Tehrai. have, however, recently lost their places and he may have lelt discretion to be the better part ©f val#ur« VI. Tyieal (28) With reference to para 28 of the last Ahwaz diary the Brigadier commanding Iranian troops reported *n 23rd January that the wusts at Khairabad and Shams-i-Arab had been re®ccupiei at tneir original strength. The m»st recent information, however, suggests that this report is not true and that the two p^sis have in any case been occupied by personnel of the Rehbehan garrison and not by the kezapur rvtgiment as was apparently the original plan. The same officer reports in the meantime that an additional regiment, the equipment for which is already in Ahwaz, is to be brought from Xhorramabad ©n Shahbakhti’s order to ferm a brigade at Behbehan.V’ r\ - 4 - 115 (29) An Anglo-Iranian Oil Company lorry going from Gach to ^nawe Viappened to be passing while some Qashqulis driving sheep tne Company down to Ganaweh were disputing their passage wi of. unfriendly tribesmen and a foreman travelling in the lorry(al£g$ _o_ was severely wounded *y rifle fire. The lorry alon K «tr, another cne was looted. On the following day, the manager of Ga.h Saran along with three other members of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company st^f was stopped and robbed by a very small gang that was^ apv srently waiting for a caravan. The majority of the ^ng.c- Iranian Oil Company employee^ property was recoverdoby ,-ajir Khan, the head of the Qashquli guards, within twenty four lours and the property taken from the lorries some three days ia,er. The telephone house at mile 27 of the pipe-line was robbed &lt;n 89th and 31st January and the telephone apparatus remove a or. the latter date. (Compare para 6 of Ahwaz diary for 1st December 1S42) On the same nif ht the gang, whi ^ h , -o have consisted of Boir Ahmed Garmsiris, raided flocks ^ the i.ishtar plain and wounded the headmtn of Lishtar village vac aaccessfully opposed.them, 3#) Sarghampur's protestati&gt;ns (compare para 24 of Ahwaz ii^ry for the second fortnight of December 1942) have borne lit.le fruit. Despite local rumours to the contrary, he has apparently handed over only one machine-gun and only about half the rroperty stolen fr^m the members of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company :n the hold-up on 15th October. (Compare para 6 of Ahwaz diary fcr 16th -o 31st October 1942). His own position aopears to be deteriorating, his aspirations for the kalantari of the Kuhgilu have apparent y led him to neglect the narrower interests of his own sub-cection and his brother Khusrov is reported to have collected a sufficiently large following to ensure the death of one o1 the brothers in the near future. The opposing sections of Kuhgilu, whose leaders saw His Majesty’s rice Consul in Bssnt, apnear to have achieved (for them) a remarkably united Trent and irofess to be eager t® establish and maintain the most cc?diai relations with the British authorities, (’.ith reference c the first section «f para 6 of Ahwaz diary for 15th to Seyteater, i is interesting to nete that the Persian authorities,•ver jres have been confined to those tribal leaders who have given signs of possessing the greate&amp;fpetential niubance value.) VII. Arab Affairs . (31) , «ith reference to para 29 of Ahwaz diary for the first, half of January, 46 rifles had been surrendered to Sarhang Homaycun by 23rd January. Since then results have varied between the moderately successful and the almost neglig-bl-- and Sarhang rtomayoun 1 s tone has become - xrmer as his tir-e- limits have extended. In the meantime ’'friendly warnings nave been reiterated; so far only the smaller tribes in the reign- bourhcod of the Uianab have been tackled and stronger reactions must be expected from the larger ti‘ bes such as the Ben. Turug and the Duraq; these tribes have spent considerable sums and can not be expected to surrender lightly what they have -cugnt dearly; as a result of the reduction of employment of latour by the Americans, tribes who had formerly wanted peace with profit may n#t nov: be averse to disorder. VIII. Rumours . (32)The bazar strategists have been interpreting German retreats in Russia as a preliminary to an attack through 'Hirkey. The Prime Minister's visit to 'urkey is naturally treated as a pieie of corroborative evidence.(33) Several instances have come to notice of shopkeepers accepting very much lower prices for articles when payment was made in coin as opposed to notesc This is presumably the effect of the diminution of the difference between the metallic value and the fac: period of rising prices, attribute the fantastic p] advise us to increase a] expansion .fas of the metallic ^ o val .ue of a t c k e n curreno y i. n a AX is sympathi sera in the rn eant line •ic es paid by one A nerican and ict th at they are r e c e i y r; n g counte re gov ernments anc cur wel 1-wishe ed pr estige b v ,? ar a --&gt;- ranging for' 5 an ic C n rrencyl (34) Much adverse comment is heard on the American personnel now operating the railway.

(2L) With reference to para 22 of the last Ahwaz diar;, the Gcvernor-General discovered on 4th February that the Director of Agriculture had issued orders cancelling the remainder of the ttur of the peripatetic seed v/heat commission. The Di?ector alleged that the results to date showed that sowings bcth generally and in individual cases were more extensive :haft vould have been possible had cultivators relied on government seed alone and that the commission could not therefor*, ascertain the fate of the government^ seed. The Governor-General is reported to have been extremely annoyed that ,f his commission” sJlould have been cancelled without reference to him ai 3 to have insisted that the tour should continue in order to as/ertain ihe probable wheat surplus. • • • • ,22) V/ith reference to para 21 of the last Ahwaz diar.S meeting itoorramabad's demands left the Finance Department unab.e to issue seed to some sheikhs who had made payments in ad;ance unofficial as welj. as official) for their wheat. Nin:- tons cf undistributed seed from Shushtar and some surplus airley from llaraidiyeh is reported to have been issued to the sheikhs cn the intervention of Colonel Homayoun. The fate of ieed issued «o long after the time for sbwing is hardly a matter e-en for ipeculation, but in some cases arabs are reported to have borrowed seed in the expectation of getting the Goverrment seed vOr v/hich they have paid and are under the necessity to return *hat they have borrowed. • ,23) V/ith reference to para 25 of the last Ahwaz diar/, attempts to control the rise of prices have so far beet ibortive. The Governor-General had very properly daciied thhfc ihe first step was to obtain accurate information abou: existing stocks of commodities. Me accordingly directed all dealers to submit returns of their stocks by the 12*,h cf February, ir. default of which* their establishments would be closed. The »frchants replied that although they had stocks the r were merely acting as forwarding agents for individuals In -he north frnd failed to submit the required returns. One prominent merchant was discovered in an attempt to send sugar rerth by ^oad but by 12th February the timelimit had expired with so Jl^tle progress made thr.t the Governor-General felt himself unable to carry out his threat of closing the shores cf defaulters and gave another 15 days time for them to *cmply ¥ith his orders. The municipality's committee for the control of successfully postponed action as i result of .he unavoidable absence” of th^ Chairman (himself a rrominent ^erchant). This seems to have been an unnecessary ma^oex-Vre no attempt has been made to enforce the prices niblished ^t the committee s postponed meeting. Sugar has accordingly fisen to Rials 75 per kilo and tea to Rials 105 per half kilo &gt;24) .The tirne-lag that •ccurs in Persian administration between the inception of measures in the capital and :heir Jxe'bution in the provinces has been illustrated in Anti-hoarding depirtment' s attempt to check the number of hands tnrough which commodities pass between the import and the consumer. /Instructionsft Instructions for,the use Of the coupons thut Wnro ta introdliped in connection With this rnenflure nppesred in ♦ , He Aktari-fiuz of Uth January.

The leader of the gang, on hearing that the van was British government property, directed that the equipment should r.ot le touched or the driver and operator stripped; he was, however, ur.able to resist the temptation of relieving the driver ar.d operator of Rials 900/-.

(16) The efforts of the British authorities to persuade the Persians to attempt some control of prices meet with a. vane Vt / of obstacles and some success. The Governor-beneral, when^pressed to take firmer action against hoarders, produced a letter irom the Ministry of the Interior forbidding him to interfere in the work of the other departments 'in view of conrolaints received from various departments and particularly from the Dep&lt;-nme n t of Justice”.

T *o details are yet available, but rumours hav^ been heard of gendarmerie casualties and the A.A.O. reports that a gang whs seen l*ter in the /dayday sharing loot which included gendarmerie uniforms. (19) Colonel Homayuni has called upon riohamed duss*.ln Taheri, kalantar of the section to which the gang is reoorted to helong, to surrender the offenders and return the stolen property. No answer, it is understood, has !*een received. The Officer ^pCommanding troops is also repotted to have called in i.ialik x.iansur, hea^ ©f the Basht Bavi and to hav° started discussions with Balik iviansur's masterful mother,. These discussions presumably refer to the occupation of Basht Kf(compare para 23 of Ahraz diary,for 1st to 15th January) which Colonel homayuni appears determined tc carry out in spite of the difficulties of protecting a thirty mile line of communication through difficult country, f2«) Nhs ^r.g' .-■■Iranian Oil Company telephone house at mile 27 (compare para 20 of the last Ahwaz diary) has again been raided and some damage done to instruments. As the result of considerable pressure, a small detachment of gendarmerie has been sent for protection of the telephone house. VI. Arab s (21) With reference to para 31 of the last Ahwaz diary about two thirds of the Khasraj Abdullah came in and made their submission on the appearance af Cel. .Homayuni's forces. The men of the recalci trant section, met the Persian forces on 15th February and suffered three casualties against the Persians' one. They were, however, obliged to retire leaving their families under the control of the Persian forces. The loader of the recalcitrant section is new reported to have asked the military Governor of Cusar.gird for terms. (22) Colonel Homayuni had planned,provided Persian aircraft arrived, to proceed with the postponed operation for the disarmament of the Beni Turuf on 20th February, On the previous day it was found that the I^ritish military authorities had provided military transport for this operation. It was felt that the use of British military transport would gratuitously involve the British in s. military operation against the Arabs which did not directly icncern our interests and was primarily a Persian responsibilityPersian government departments, civil or military, have a profound reluctance to pay f»r hired transport, and it was only with the greatest difficulty that civilian hired transport in plaje of the military trucks was procured for the Persian forces. Finally, on the day fixed, the Persian aircraft assigned for the operation had. not appeared and the Officer Commanding on *2 again postponed his departure, (23) Tith reference fe para 32 of the last Ahw&amp;z diary the Persian Officer Commanding troops reports that the Arab rilled in the incident at Deh Mulla had apparently been run down before he was shot. (24) Seyed Issa Kamaluddin f in an interview with a member of the A.L.O's staff recently, mentioned that Arabs would not tike part in the forthcoming elections as they did not c insider themselves to be Iranians and proposed to send a mission to 'rnq to retro sent their claims and grievances to the Allied nations and representative of other Arab nations. Charges of tyranny and neglect of culti vation were levied against she Iranian Government and a lonparison drawn with the peace and prosperity which pr-vailed in tr.e time of Sheikh Khazal. VII.

(19] Two inches of rainfall in the last fortnight of February and a further inch in the first fortnight of March have again yimproved crop prospects, reports from outside centres speak of substantial though unspecified falls in the price of wheat in consequence. The consumer in the town has received little direct benefit as bread in still selling at the same price with the merchants and bakers pocketing the tffifferen&amp;e; a distinct improvement It. the quality of the bread sold is, however, reported. (20) The seasonal spring decrease in the price of commodities produced in the country, which is reported normally to be as much ss 50 r i, has been much smaller this year. Good mutton, which up to &amp; fortnight ago was selling at 30 rials per kilo, is n jw down to rials 25, and ghee which was rials 420 for 7£ kilos is now down vo rials 380. ^ 21) bith reference to para 23 of &gt;Jiwaz diary for 1st so 15th ^ February, four bags of sugar seized from the well-known merchant Sehdashti have been made over to authorised shops for selling at Municipal rates, ^his appears to have done littxe to reduce the jrowds at the sugar shops, the shop-keepers swear that Economic Department has issued twice as many coupons as they have supplied sugar, while the Economic Department accuses (without farther action) ihe shop-keepers of keeping back supplies to,sell at black market ?ates. ' 22) With reference to para 24 of idiwaz diary for 1st to 15th vs February, declarations fr.jm merchants are coming in very slowly and execution of the lav; is delayed by the reference to Tehran cf certain cases where a merchant is also importer and retailer. 7. Tribal 23) The arrival of marshal rhahbakhti in fhiraz and the iespatch of a column to Kazerun has already caused considerable apprehension in the Kuhfilu: it was renorted that the Boir Ahmed Sarhaddi lowov sections under Abdullah Khan Darghampur and 'the i.j&gt;per sections under Mohamed Hussain Tahery were drawing together, while the Darashuris were trying to compose their differences with the Boir Ahjneds; Nasser Khan ^ashqai was also .said to have demanded riflemen from each of the ^ashqai sections. Marshal fhahbakhti' s circular addrersea to tribal leaders of Khuzistan and Mars caused still more excitement and more vigo^rous attempts £c form a united front. Abculiah Khan Karghampur was supposed to be seeking a meeting with Nasser Khan Mashqai and a representative of some standin? from the Darashuris was said to be already with Abdullah Khan. In the •meantime a letter from Nasser to Abdullah Khan fell into the hands of the Kersian Authorities; the contents of the letter are known only at fifth hand, but Nasser is believed to have asxed Abdullah for a move before Nourus to tie down the Khuzistan forces and to acquire arms, a letter from Zaki Khan, the Darashuri leader, wnich aiso fell into the Persian Authorities* hands, is Reported to have denied the reports of the German retreats on the Russian front and to have called on Abdullah Khan for action in Confidence of the imminence of N3er Tag*’. The Darashuri and3 'been Q^shcLuli fire said to have/instructed not to cross the Pehlian Kiver but to hold themselves in readiness for an early move along with the Boir Ahmed rarhaddi uppcri* flocks y and the Darashuri in particular were to maintain contact with hargh&amp;mpur for instructions in case of an emergency. (24) Sarhang Humayuni sav; i/Ialek iiansur^ the Basht Bavi leader? and iviuzaf far Khan Ariani, the B»ir Ahmed Garmsir leader, at Gach '^^aran aerodrome on 8 th i,iarch. he warned both in very Much the same tone as as Marshal Bhahbakhti's circular 'feut, although he asked Malek Mansur a number of questions that v. r ould be of importance if a Persian Garrison were to move to Basht? no direct mention of the advance was made. It is believed that the Persian Couimander feels himself unable with his present forces and commitments to make such a move. If he has to await reinforcement it seems impossible that any effective action can be taken to disarm the Kuhgilu tribes before the Cummer migration or indeed until they return to their winter quarters six months hence. (25) A troop of the C.I.'L who were spending the night on the j.ishtar plain, between Behbehan and Gaeh Saran? became involved in a tribal raid on the Lishtar village on the night of 9th lu&amp;rch. The Indian Officer opened fire after some shots had come dangerously near his camp and was later thanked by the gendarmes of the Lishtar post whose ammunition had been exhausted. A member of the gang, which was apparently about fifty strong - mostly mounted is reported to have called on the te?oop to surrender their arms and retire under promise of safe conduct from the raiders, bo casualties, as far as is kn&lt;swn? were suffered by either side. (26) '“'he ’’Mile 2 r 7 ,: telephone house (compare paragraph 20 of last Ahwaz Diary) was raided by an armed gang on the night of 12th March. The four gendarmes who had been posted there had left on the previous day but the five tufangchis who remained apparently gut up a good fight and drove cff the raiders. (27) Pith reference to the incidents reported in paragraph 17 of the last Ahwaz Diary, Colonel Murnayuni had held the Boir Ahmed Sarhaddi uppur sections responsible and called on their Xalantar to produce the offenders. Captain Mohajer, the Officer Commanding Gendarmerie in Behbehan, was found to have held a number of road labourers of the 7;oir Ahmed Garmsiri in connection with the same incidents and reported to have been applying duress in an attempt to involve his old enemy, Muzaffar Khan Ariani* (Muzaffar, though of little tribal consequence and certainly incapable of organising a gang of the size involved in the incidents under reference, is known as pro-British and a rn&amp;st useful person to the Anglo*'!ranian Oil Co s ), (28) A party of Hayat Dawoodi, who have established themselves at Taj ivialiki on the road between Gan aw eh and Gach Saran, have I been levying octroi on foodstuffs and piece goods and claim they are so doing on the orders ®f the British Authorities in Bushire, On 7th March, a bale of cloth was taken from an Anglo-Iranian Oil Co, van in addition to the octroi, and a short tii#e after the van was looted and the inhabitants stripped ~ still in Hayat Duwoodi limits.

V. Tribal . (12) The extreme tension among the Kuhgilu trikes reported in ? ara 23 of the last Ahwaz diary appear*' to have disappeared, argely doubtless because the Persian military forces*die not make th^jr expected move before Nauruz. The Darashuri, who w*re to have followed a new route to their summer quarters in concert with the Boir Ahmed barhaddi, have begun their mdve and aave crossed the :iuhreh river with the evident intention of fallowing th£Ar normal rout©. The united f©ont which the tribes had ostensibly attained appears to have disintegrated and the normal state of chaos has keen resumed: Abdullah Khan Zarghaupur is reported by the A.L.O. to have asked for a meeting to be arranged with the authorities, but his brother Khuerow is suppose* to have approached the Officer Commanding Persian Troops wi'-.h an offer to liquidate Zarghampur - on terms; Ohulam Hussain Jalil, a former support of Mohamed Hussain Tahery,is now reported to have gone over to Zarghampur and a number of collisions ire said to occurred between the two factions. (13) v . ith reference to para 29 of the last Ahwaz diary Aii Asgar and Akol Qasem soon began to cast their net wider and wrote to Mohamed Ali Khan Khalili Behmai, protesting in somewhat ominous tones against the Behmai leaders rather respectable relations with the Persian authorities. Reports continued to come in fo? the rest of the fortnight of concentrations of Bhkhtiari and Sehmai malcontents. The ^e^uence of events became rather okscurj but on 31st March a considerable force - certainly not the on* thousand reported by the Military Governor of Izeh - move3 on and captured Izeh. The military Governor succeeded in making his escape along with the garrison, both cavalry and infantry, the former bringing in the latters’^ arms. Alarmist rumours attacks on the iuiplo-Iranian Oil Co. areas at Masjid-l-buiaiman have so far proved unfounded and njt very impressive Persian forces have been ‘'ent aut from kam Hormuz in the direction of Baiun.

General In the second fortnight of the month the Persian authorities reparted 2« cases of typhup, of which 10 were fatal, and 15 cases of typhoid, of which six were fatal. The ISlectric supply Company, which has consistently over-loaded and failed t« maintain its installations, has for some months been able to supply the town with current for a few heurs only each day.The Allied forces have so far been unable to supply the numerous spares neccessary for re pair of the installation and efforts of the company to buy new dynamos in the north have been unsuccessful. The Cotton Factory, which gets its power from the same supply, has now been closed down to enable the te&gt;wn to get ten hours current daily and the cost ®f current raised from Rials 4 to Rials i per unit in trder to compensate the share-holders of the fac tory. The Manager of the supply Company states, however, that his plant cannot possibly maintain even this load for mwre than a few wesk^. 15* The Commissioner of Police reported on 2tth May that he had not received any funds for feeding prisoners since the beginning of the Persian year, (a similar report state? that payed Issa—see paraVIbelow— had to pay not only his own fare to Burujird but that »f hip escort as well.) The commissioner blames his lack of funds on the military officers who are be ing drafted into the Police Department and are, according to him, innocent of administrative ability or experience. 16. The Allied forces have recently had a narrow escape from being deprived of ice. The capacity of the local ice- factories is not sufficient to provide all the i«s desired by the town population and the forces, but could, if the sup ply was properly regulated and a^price-war avoided, supply an^ amount not far from adequate. When, therefore, the Governor- General represented that the 30 rials per block which the British military authorities proposed to pay would make it impossible for any of the public except the wealthiest to buy Ice and that he had every hope ^f introducing a ’'controlled” price of 15 rials per block, it was readily agredd that the military authorities should not conclude any contract until the Governor-General had a chance to reduce the pric^. A fort night later it was found that no attempt had been male to inis . introduce a controlled price but that all the Persian govern ment departments had concluded contracts for Rig.25 ter block, ^_ and that attempts had been made to conclude other contracts £*euld which&lt;/nave left n-« ice for the forces.

Be cm oil ic . {Q) Aghai Nafisi reports that 5000^tons of grain lave now been delivered against undertakings for 14000 tons. ( 9 ) All the reports from the Arab Khalisejat indicate that the undertakings from these areas were extorted witnoufc regard tc sowing, yields or surpluses. Prom the- Ahwaz area OiU^ ’ ^ eighth of the amount of grain for which undertakings were gi ^en has so far been surrendered. (10) On 4th July government control over the sale of^bread in Ahwaz town was reestabiishedo Tne Finance Departmeno 15 tons of grain at Kials 3 per kilo to the bakers who v.ure oc sell bread at the same price and get an honest profit ct something over 35%. The temptation to adulterate and. arm grain bought at Rials 3000 per ton while Government war buying outside at Rials 4000 proved overwhelming and the breaxi on first day of issue was on the whole short m quanti ty tiv.x _ in quality. A hurried meeting of the prominent hoarders vx -ae town was summoned on the same day at whicn it was apparera,x t .- ^ proposed to fomdnt riots and put an end to the scheme -O-^ n wi more moderate counsels pi'evailed and the merchants cox.it/en tliemselves with sending a telegram to fne majiis prote/ri Aug ^■ the unjustifiable attack on their profits. ( 11 ) On the following day, it was realised that the cheap /bread v . j£- ~ /2r ^,1 ^ I nr ©Icfj efif I '.|4^ e*i a^w ?J: t \^i: ^atroIXol artr now ■p~ 'bread had caused a number of people who normally baked in their own hornet? from flour drawn as 'rations from allied sources* or privately bought, to resort to the brea#fihops, and five tons more than on the previous day were issued. The broadshops were even more congested, and the quality of the bread was worse. The Finance officials were able to clear themselves easily by producing samples of grain (which were excellent) taken when the grain was handed over to the Municipality for sale to the bakers and by pointing out that some of the breadshcps were able to produce thoroughly good bread (this was in fact true) with the grain issued to them, (12) The patience of the more interested faction among the merchants was by this time exhausted, A noisy deputation visited the Governor-General and demanded the freeing of the market. Referred to the Finance Department, they went to the office of the Director, which is shared by Aghai Nafigi, and having collected a mob of some hundreds en route proceeded to break up the office to emphasise their demands. Aghai Rafisi was thoroughly shaken,and after a hurried telephone conversation with the Governor-General agreed to the market being freed. The mob, who had shouted not for more, better, or cheaper bread, but for permission to the merchants to supply wheat, dispersed quietly when the Chief of Police informed them of the decision, 'Free bread' of moderate quality was available at Rials 12 per kilo on the evening of the same day; on the following day bread of poorer quality was on sale in sufficient quantities at 7,50 per kilo, (13) The mob nad been led by one Bahbahani, a prominent merchant of Ahw&amp;z who is credited with having made several fortunes since the removal of government control of the supply of bread some twelve months ago. Rahirni, manager of the Electric supply Co,, and Vokhshuri, m anager of Abrinhomka r.? Ahwaz ? most notorious wheat speculator, were also promineht 'in the mob - a circumstance which lent weight to the Contention of the Governor-General and Aghai Nafisi that Abrishomkar was the leader o s uhe movement. All four persons were arrested at noon of 6th July and left for Buru.jird on the same evening, at which place they were to remain until orders were received from Tehran fixing a more unpleasant place of exile. |(W) As the British I having inspired the four a I the first real action ever has been difficult to asse narily unconscious of the previous quarrels with the General 1 s reason for en^nii four persons arrested gave that could not very well b are almost universally credited with rrests, the real reaction to this - ■ taken against hoarders in Khuzistan - ns. Public opinion seems extracrdi- fact that Aghai Nafisi had had Abrishomkar family and the Governor- ty with- Behbahani or that three of the a challenge'to the Persian authorities e ignored. (15) Meantime the supply of bread in Ahwaz is^free” and was to remain so until such time as authority was received from Tehran to sell grain to the bakers at a price in accordance with that at which government is buying grain from the landlords and a reserve of flour accumulated for issue to the bakers sufficient to meet any rush on the bread shops. The necessary authority to•sell grain to the bakers at Rials 4.50 per kilo and bread to j the public at Rials 4 was received on July l£th 9 The establishment of a controlled market should, therefore, be a matter of a few days, (1-6) ^ Khwjeh Mehdi Quli has agreed with the Rais-i-ICiarbar of Ali Godarz to deliver six hundred tons of wheat which he will collect from the area under his influence provided he- is not' interfered with by the Kharbar or the amnieh. This ic good news /since~3- 0 since hardly any wheat wascallected from the Ah-i-Earik area last year.

Aghai Smad, an employee of the Anglo- Iranian Oil CCo, is understood to be standing for Dlzful, but no ^ Arab candidate has appeared for P5usangird and the Ahwaz advocate, Waeir-i-Nesami, who proposes tc represent the Arabs there, has visited the constituency, (18) Aghai Sultani, the Behbahan deputy, though so far unopposed, made a popular gesture by persuading the amnieh to return Rials 4000 which they had taken from some Arabs of Busaneh in return for not revealing the discovery of smuggled goods (19) With reference to para 15 of the last Ahwaz diary, the ^■depressior^by the further curtailment of his jurisdiction, ' }Having lost Khtrramshahr and Abadan during the last year, he has ;as)ncw been ordered to withdraw the police from Andimeshk, ghadegan •re)and Gach garan. Colonel Albcrz protested that the Andimeshk ;detachment should not be withdrawn but in reply met with the curtest injunction to obey orders. The Governor-General has, however, on the representation of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co./ held up line withdrawal of the' police from Gach saran and has undertaken to help in the restoration of the Andimeshk detachment.

In addition to Abdullah Khan Zarghampur, it appears that Mchd. Hussain Tahery was present with a large following, as well as Ali and Vali Panizadeh with their own parties. Rais-utr-fujjar has expressed the strongest apprehension about the possible repercussions in Khuzistan, and, without being aware that Alavi and Majid Khan Bakhtiari were supposed to have been involved, volunteered the information that the results would be doubly dangerous should the German offensive on the Eastern Front meet with any success.

A (ll) A further oifficiity ‘.uat has emerged is that of the undertakings so far given over 42 are for the surrender of barley us op oseo to wheat. The Persian autaoritieo feel that any de ; ree of adulteration of wheat over 85 would produce disc stent on a ^eale wiiich they could :ot control. 1 an Director of Finance states thrjt he hopes to receive ingtructiona fro i Tehran that 1500 tons of wheat flour &gt;orted by^ U. k.C.C* and now in Ahwaz will be placed at his disposal, ’he precise terms jj tiie trangactio however, are obscure: if the amount ip being given outright to the rJivvaz a tthori— | ties, it will no some way to solving the problem of the excess of burl v as ’vr.il 3 * eeting 1 ue total deficit of 3000 tons; 1 it iap to^epaid by barley, it will help with the forme] &gt;roblem; if it hag to ue repaid in wheat, it will servo no useful purpose at all, as ther is now sufficient grain available for Ahwaz to areak trie hoarders* and bakers’ ring if that organisation cun be broken by supplying bread at givern.ient prices for a few aonths.

(11) With reference to para 15 of the last Ahwa:. diary, the Finance Department has so far made no move to take over control of the town bakeries from the Municipality, Some complaints have been heard about short weight, but the quality of the oread remains unchanged and there is no congestion in the b?oad shops in Ahwaz town. (12) The following statement shows the position .In regard to deliveries of grain at the end of Mordad (23rdAugust):- Undertakings Deliveries. Ahwaz area 2,800 tons 1,000 tong Dizful 2,880 '» 2,100 11 Shushtar 1,500 u 1,200 t?

It is understood that Mr. Solomon, the American adviser on food supplies in ICauzi^tan, has recommended to Dr, Millsp&amp;ugh that the towns of Khuzistan, with the exception of Ahwas and Khorramnhahr, should he exempt from the operation of the regulations on the very sound undertakings had been received arranged are underlined by the 1 the 7*0^ pen sibility of p • i iTji '1 eg the re gu 1 ,. 4 .

(14) The scheme for the part payment for wheat in barter hag still not been introduced as no orders have yet been received by the Customs to release sugar for the scheme. A certain, friction arose on return of the Director of Finance from Tehran where he professed to have understood that the scheme would not be begun until all undertakings had been fulfilled. In fact, even at the increased rate of progress of deliveries in the Ahwaz area, the undertakings would not fulfilled until ploughing for the next crop had begun. In the meantime grain has b-uen going down the.Karun in such quantities as seriously to prejudice the prospects of the sugar barter scheme when it does begin, ana Mr, 'olomon does not feel he has the legal powers, much less the necessary organisation ana personnel, for stopping the movement Of wheat to Xhorramshahr, until he is a position to establish a government supply of bread for Khorramshahr. (16) The problem of the excess of barley (see para 11 of Ahwaz Diary for the second half of July) is no nearer solutions Indeed, the Hindijan ''wheat 1 * is reported to contain 10% more barley than the normal Khuzistan 'wheat'. If the sugar barter scheme is a success, doubtless sufficient wheat will he acquired to redress the balance, and apparently overtures made by the Finance Department to Tehran •^faring to exchange exce.es barley for wheatfor wheat have 'been favourably received« As either course would take time and it was apprehended that sufficient wheat might not be available in Ahwaz and Khorramsho.hr to maintain the government bread supply, it was proposed to use a portion of the 8800 tons of Canadian wheat flour to bridge the gap. Orders have now been received, however, to forward/Tehran what ■remains of the entire consignment (Gray Mackenzie report a shortage of 5lbs per bag in addition to the five hundred bags 'lost” between Khorramghahr and Ahwaz) and unless the’ sugar barter scheme can be put into effect forthwith, a breakdown •• in the bread supply seems inevitable. (16) The usual seasonal rise in the pric^ of meat has been increased by the ineptitude of the Director of the Municipality to exercise control and even moderate mutton at 30 rialn a kilo has been difficult to obtain. The Director of the Munici pality expressed his inability to. help on the grounds that contractors for the American forces were forcing up the price in competition with the Angio-Iranian Oil Company contractor, who was already paying Rials 25 per kilo live wight. Enquiries showed that the American forces' requirements for fresh meat were being met through British Army contractors who were paying Rials 5 per live poundI s_ The employees of the Posts and Telegraphs Department in DizdTul had a one day strike for an increase of wages on 84th August. IV. Genera l. (18) The return of the Governor-General to Ahwaz hap settled the tendencious rumour-mongering of the Abrishomkar faction, who had broadcasted that the Governor-General had been 'broken' in Tehran. They have now taken refuge in the story that he has been returned temporarily as a face-saver pending the abolition of the IJstandari of Khuzistan and Luristan. (The Director of Finance stated on his return from Tehran that the proposal to abolish the Ustandari in Ustan VI had been dropped.) (19) With reference to para 15 of Ahwaz diary for the first half of June, the police have nov/, with three weeks of the summer left, received their summer uniforms. The Commissioner of Police algo reports that the allowance for prisoners' diet money has been increased from seven to ten Rials per day. (20) With reference to para 17 of Ahwaz diary for the second half of July, the gendarmerie has received a measure of reinfor cements from the north. This is doubtless responsible for a general improvement in the immediate Ahwas area reported by non-official European sources. They have, however, entirely failed to deal with the seasonal decline in security (see Tribal sections) which appears serious. V* Tribal—Bakhtiari (21) Considerable tension is reported from the Janiki area as result of the delayed arrival of Murteza Quli Khan's representative. A report from the same area tells of the break-down of negotia tions between Murteza Quli and Abul Qasim who is said to have taken himself off to the Kuh-i-Dinar. On 31st August an armed gang thought to have come down from JaniJfci looted four vehicleg( fcars one of them Delonging to the Anglo-Iranian Qil Company) and a village about a mile outside Ram Hormuz. (22) ^ A quarrel has taken place at Abbarik between Xhwajeh Mehti Quli and his brother Reza in which four men of the latter were killed. (33) Fereidunwi a son of Murteza Quli Khan, having failed in /his approach4 head* iiis approach to Khwajeh Mehti Quli, han been replaced by hir? brother Amir Bahman Khan Ramsam, who is now encamped with ten tents in the Ghaman Rulian area, (84) A demonstration of protest against the importunate activities of a wheat Official, Dr, Arnanpur, who had demanded the wife of a respected Haji, Abu Talib of Al-i-Godarz, was -^dispelled to give a show of quiet and peace on receipt of the news of His Majesty’s Consul-General’s approach to the town. Dr, Amanpur is causing much unrest and one landlord alone complains that 10,000 tumang have been demanded from •' • him. The landlord does not m nd paying the recognised fee to the permanent official, but to have to support a Tehran parasite gets his gall, VI, Tribal—Kuhfillu, (35) With reference to para 26 of the last Ahwaz diary, Khusrow, brother of Abdullah Khan Zarghampur. met Colonel Humayuni a:id accompanied him to Eehbehan/where conversations are understood to have followed the traditional lines of the' penitent c«iiei oain vowing perpetual devotion to the government if he were given sufficient rifles to -Drove himself, and the* Persian representative demanding proof' off the Khan’s . ability to produce results before risking rifles with him. The convert sations inevitably remained somewhat in the air pending the arrival of General Jehanbani, Khusrow in the meantime was retorted to have become very restive in Behbahan, and the Raig-ut-?uijar faction increased their efforts.proportionately to oersuade the British authorities to give some assurance' to Khusrow, l26) On 24th August Colonel Humayuni rerouted that Zarghampur had reached Pilli ( a suitable advance base fo? operations against Behbahan) -with a considerable force and chat a reconnaissance party of Zarghampur ? s sawar-* Irod be-n in the Tang~i~Takab, (Z?) General Jehanbani appears to have been ( very reasonably) too concerned with the condition of his men and other specifically military problems to plunge into the devious intrigues of the Kuhgilu, Probably, too, he was concerned with a u biggeu*/; 'tq stated ^ha o he had received a ietter from Zax*ghampur agkinr for an interview. As it would have taken three days for Zarghampur to get down to Do Gumbedan, General Jehanbani said tnat he would fly back again for the interview as soon as his other duties permitted, l28) With reference to the withdrawal of the Persian military garrison from Do Gumbedan reported in para 25 of tie lagt Ahwaz diary, a masterly compromise between the danger of exposing a hundred Persian soldiers’ rifles to the tribes and the risk of leaving the aerodrome and Anglo-Iranian Oil Companv pimping station entirely unprotected was a achieved by stationing at Do Gumbedan a very much smaller number of gendarmes. Tie gendarmes, however, have now been moved and the barracks at Do Gumbedan occupied by a detachment of Skinner'p Horse, and Rarha v ^ Humayuni wins the day, VII, Tribal—Ar ab, l 3 ?) , _ With reference to para 33 of the last Ahwaz diary, Golonel Humayuni on 18th August arrested Radun, the brother of Rheikh Jabbar of Zargan, on the grounds that so far* from nroducinu Jabbar and the four government rifles taken by him, he had actually been sheltering his brother, Zabberi, another brother, ip- in the meantime attempting to snow his devotion {l) to the government by promig^ing to collect before the end of Rhahrivar a portion of the isfhsat which he ought to hage delivered in fu.ll two monthe ago.

A number of small raids are reported from the left bank of the Karun between Mullas^ni and Band~i“Qir&lt;.

(37) The fate of the Ahwaz constituency is still obscure, as the Governor-General reports four ,f possible n candidates Aghai Nasseri ( the present deputy) Agha Khajavi (President of the High Court), the Rais-ut-Tujjar, and a son of Mu’in Bushiri. Aghai Nasseri, who professes the greatest confidence in D Millspaugh ? s Income Tax Bill and his own prospects, arrived in Ahwaz on 24th August and went off on a lightning tour of his estates* Dr. sahms Jezairi (compare para 36 of the last Ahwaz diary) is expected in Ahwaz on 1st August when the •Phushtari members of the Finance Department are reported to have planned a grand reception* (it is generally believed that Col.

Ill* General . (16) With reference to para 18 of the last diary, the proposal to abolish the Ustandari appears to have been dropped. 1 The Farmandar states that he received a telegram on 13th September directing him to report to Tehran as the Farmandari had been abolished. -(i?) Rome adverse comment has been heard on the conduct of 0 arhang Purastegar, the O.C. gendarmerie, who is reputed to hav'e taken himself off to Luristan with the knowledge that a crisis in Arab affairs in the southern part of the district wag impending and stayed away until the trouble was over. (18) The Governor-General has expressed some surprise that General Jehanbanidid not wait an extra day in Ahwaz for his return to discuss the problems of Khuzistan. Less disinterested persons like Aghai Nasseri, the Ahwaz deputy, have held mild indignation meetings on the same subject. (19) Y/ith reference to para 14 of the diary for the first . half of June, the Electric Guppiy Company has now succeeded in putting one engine in order and proposes to supply current from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. It remains to be seen whether to Governor- General will be able to resist pressure to pay the share-holders of the Spinning Factory for failure to maintain their power plant at the expense of consumers of electricity in the town* IV. Economic . ( 20 ) The Governor-General and the Municipality continue to supervise the baking and sale of bread. The results are at any rate good enough to prevent any serious grumbling. (21) Deliveries against undertakings have fallen off badly and only about 160 tons have been delivered in the last fortnight. 'ftib amounts outstanding in the 'landlords areas”—with the exception of Dlzful—were negligible and may well represent assessments that were unduly severe or the owner felt he was sufficiently inaccessible or unimportant to escape penal action by the authorities. (22) The 'sealing' of Ahwaz town-~comp&amp;re para 13 of the last ’.',3 diary—has good results, reinforced as it has been by a measure of control of river traffic passing down the Karun. In fact the amount of wheat confiscated as it was surreptitiously introduced into the town has been inconsiderable and does not exceed 30 tons* The indirect results have been more important. The local Arab**, for example, clearly believed that the sealing of the town wap merely a routine measure for increasing the emoluments of the petty /on to official, the cost of which could easily be passed/the would-be hoarders among the middle-class townspeople, and did not at first find the terms offered under the sugar barter scheme sufficiently /attractive.attractive in comparioon with the xKBjry very high hiack-raarket prices which the middle-claeshoarders were expected to maintain* The Arabs gradually 'became convinced, however, that the control wan seriously intended and wa* efficient enough to make the import of wheat into the town an uncommercially high risk; the prospects of the barter scheme improved enonmouBly and it became Impossible to obtain any firm black market quotations for wheat* Although sugar was released for the barter scheme at the beginAing of the month, results were slow to appear. It had been Mr, Solomon’s intention that deliveries made under the sugar barter scheme should not be credited against undertakings but that the liabilities under the undertakings should be enforced indepen dently wheever th§ Persian authorities felt themselves in a position to do so; the shifekhs finally convinced Mr* Solomon that such a course was quite impracticable and he agreed to credit delive ries under the barter scheme against undertakings. The process of establishing confidence has also been slow* The importance of this factor is clearly shown by the contrast between progress with the barter scheme in Ahwaz where the accessibility of a black market had reduced deliveries against undertakings virtua lly to nothing, and Hindijan, where the distance of a profitable black market had actually led’.* peaaants to deliver more than they had undertaken to do* One wouid have expected the barter scheme to show very slow progress around Ahwa* and be an immediate success in Hindijan. In fact, the sugar scheme in the Ahwaz area, though slow in getting under way, is producing a higher rate of delivery than was made against undertakings, while in the Hindijan-area, where Mr. Solomon has not yet been able to exoercise much personal supervision, no progress has yet been made. (24) The most important development in the wheat situation, however, has been the discovery of considerable hoards of grain in Arab villages in the Ahwaz area, amounting to 90 tons in one instance and over 100 tons in another* These hqrds were di«closed by a relatively minor official of the grain collection department who, having been chosen as a scapegoat by the Pishkar for the failure to collect against undertakings in the Ahwaz area, was anxious to justify him«olf at the Pishkar’s expense. Mr. nolomon reports that his informant stated that he could produce two or three thousand tons of wheat similarly hoarded, but had taken no steps against the Arabs because he was forbidden to do so by the Officer Commanding the Persian Forces 'on political grounds* w (25) A certain amount of embarrassment is likely to be caused by Mulla Badayer, a worthless village spy who was rewarded beyond his deserts for his services against the Arabs under Reza nhah and is still able by fear and threats to command a degree of influence among the Arabs of Anafijieh. Although he now owns a considerable quantity of fertile land, his uervices to the Persian forces had always made it inconceivable that any action should be taken against him to enforce delivery of grain* It now appears that he not only failed to deliver leven eighth of his underta kings, but has also been making propaganda among his peasants against the sugar barter scheme. These facts have been brought to the notice of the Governor-General who promises the strongest support in any action taken against him*. (26) In Japlak and Burburood, a highly productive wheat area which provided* a surplus of about 6000 tons, the wheat collector Dr. Amanpur had, bp his excessive extortions, caused such a stir that the C.L*0«, Mr. Bourne, and H*M*Consul-Beneral set out on hie track* He seems to be in partnership with Tadayun, late Minister of Pood, and Itibar-ud-Daulet, Minister of Agriculture, with whose assistance the Rais-i-Kharobar of Ali Godarz, Alayi, who was also in the racket, has been sacrificed as a scapegoat, and offers of the • return by Alayi of the bribes taken have been made by Araanpur who /Has issued4 hap ippued a notice to thip effect. Wheat collection in the area ip late, 'but phould he good. (27) In Qulpaigan and Khumain collection and the giving of undertakings are proceeding patipfactorily. In Khonsar all applies of wheat, Government or otherwise, have been cut off owing to the confused situation regarding the* collection of the surplus of the Kachambu and Gorgeh districts of Isfahan from which Kh£nsar is usually supplied, but for the surplus of which some landlords have this year made contracts with Col. Robert at Isfahan. (28) Khorrarnabad, The late and worse than ordinary Kharobar official Parud has been relieved. V, Tribal—Bakhtiari (29) No news of the arrival of Morteza Quli’s governor^ for the Janiki country has yet been received. Col. Humayuni r s plans for .. sending a punitive column to the area strongly supported by Mohammad Ali Khan Khalili and his tufangchis seem likely to be delayed as a result of the incident at Jaizan. (see para 32 below) VI. Tribal—Kuhgilu . (30) The first week of the month passed very quietly to the accopaniment of propaganda from Zarghampur f s supporters to the effect that he had ordered all incidents to cease pending the consideration of his case by the Persian Government. Khusrow— compare para 25 of the last diary—received fifty rifles and 3500 rounds of ammunition as weifel as presents of sugar and tea from ^ Col. Huraayuni and went off to prove himself by expelling Zarghampur T s supporters from Dil. Musuvvi, who would clearly rather sea Zarghampur liquidated than become the strongest pro-government^ influence in the Xuhgilu by making his peace, put up another plea for British assurances to Khusrow on the grounds that when the Persian government regained its strength Khusrow might be held responsible for offences in fact committed by his brother. The latest news indicates that Khusrow was successful in taking Dil, but is no himself besieged there by reinforcements from Sarghampuro (31) The attempt to bring the Teibi tribe into the anti- Zargharapur bloc had also gone badly. The chief of the Teibi Ganasiri had demanded so large a number of rifles as the price of adherence that it became quite impossible tc treat with him. Teibi raids on Do Dungeh followed quickly, but were repelled after the raiders had lost one man killed, another captured, and two rifles. On 7th September the Teibis returned in force and - according to Mussavi carried off 1500 sheep, 300 cattle and moveable property to the value of a million rials(i) 32 (32) On the night of 9th September a highly obscure incident occurred. Mohd. Ali /Chan Khalili, the hitherto highly trusted^ Behinai chieftain, is reported to have seized Rezavi, the landlord of Jaizan, in defiance of the laws of hospitality, obtained treache rous entry to the fort at Jaizan where he disarmed the amnieh and Rezavi’s tufangchis, and carried off all the grain and cattle to be found. Mohd. Ali Khan certainly had a claim on a ohare of the crops of Jaizan and had been gathering men and provisions for the expedition to Janiki. The stolen cattle and sheep have apparently since been returned and a further suspicious feature is that in some previous negotiations over obtaining supplies from the estate cf Nasseri at c mltanabad the deputy and his men, even on their own /accountaccount, could not have proceeded more effectively if they had been trying to goad Mohd. Ali Khan into some indiscreet action, (33) On 10th September, tainly contained Boir Ahmed large mixed tribal gang which cer- rhaddis and Teibis (and even. ropses tribal—Arab, it (34) With reference to para 30 of the last Ahwaz diary, now appears that the Persian column has been used even more unscrupulously than usual. The sheikhs Mehdi and Haidar Tulayul had been ordered to liquidate or expel a party of Ka T ab TJrnair outlav/s who had taken refuge in the Diz 'jungles’ 7 . As they were unable to do so, a Persian column of one hundred men reinforced by bands under Mullah Badayer and sheikh Jarullah went to the Mianab to 'help'them. The outlaws crossed the river in flight to island of Nats. The people of Nais, when hailed by Persian Officer Commanding, are said to have denied sheltering the outlaws and to have invited investigation. Mulla Badayer., who had previous enmity with the people of Nais, is alleged to have misinterpreted their response as a defiant challenge. The Persian troops then gave covering fire with machine-guns, killing two women, and Mullah by Mehdi and Kaida Badayer went ana Jarullah ’3 men, eagerly joined er and sacked the village. the (35) Col. Kumayuni in reported to have called in the Beni Turuf sheikhs, expressed his disappointment at their response to hie 'kindness”, and indicated that he proposes to recommence disarmament operations- Arab opinion attributes this move to their failure to support Wazir Nezami’s candidature for the elections* VIII. Tribal—Luristan. (36) Haji Agha Hussain Qurni Mu jt ah id has sent two representatives to Burujird to press Kaji Agha Hussein Mujtahid of the latter city to go to Thhran to support the former’s demands on the Government. The Burujirdi wired the Government that he would complj r with the Qumi’s request if they did not aceedeto his demands. He does not went to support the Qurni in fact, and is now afraid of having bia bluff called.

The General came on to Ahwaz on the following day and-left for Abadan on 28th September where he stayed the night before returning to Tehran.

( 6 ) Reyyed Zia passed through Rultanabad and stayed one night. To a-rich landlord, Khak Baz, whom I asked to visit him, he stated that his policy was that of benevolent dicta torship. A mistake had been made over Reza Rhah which would have to be put right. He thought that the rich should be allowed to keep their riches but that a more even distribution should be aimed at and that the peasants lot should be les^ hard, he wap not in favour of any form of Bolshevism, mild or otherwise. He thought that Persian^ should wear a distinctive national head-dress and should revert to their old time hats one of which,he pointed out, he wore when he left Tehran and that he still wore one on his return from exile. Prominent amongst the 24 odd persons who came from Tehran to meet him were - ^artip Qarib (iiateen ul Mu Ik), Rarhang Atimad, Hussein Qalili, ^arhang Qazirn Khan, Muzz afar Furuz. Reyyed Zia’p arrival in 'mltanabad was heralded by / 2 an issue ol^anti-Rhah pamphlets. III. General (7) The Commissioner of police Ahwaz appears to have been very pleased with the promises made to him in Tehran and parti cularly by the ,, sanctioning ,&gt; of the 50% hard-living allowance. Against this, his power lias been further curtailed by orders placing the police establishments at Masjid-i-^ulaiman and Kaft Kel under the new Military Governor of Abadan. The Governor- General, it is understood, has protested vigourously against this curtailment of his authority. fii (e) The only apparent result of protests from the Cfiicer Commanding Gendarmerie about the weakness and inadequancy of his hi /forceiforces has been an order from Tehran to reduce hi? three companies at Behbahan to two companies. The gendarmerie in Behbahan were already too weak to hold and maintain the road-posts on the Agha Jari - Gach Raran road and the reduction would seem to indicate a realisation that there is no hope of security on the road until the major tribal problems have been settled with or without military operations. The appearance of sadeq Bushiri as a candidate for the Majlis raised echoes of the Abrishomkar controversy, nadeq Bushiri's programme is reported to include the return of the externed merchants and 'free trade' in Khuzistan. It may not have been pure coincidence that the Governor-General has recently set up a commission to enquire into profiteering by the T&amp;baceo Agency which is run by Behbahani and is said to have made astronomical profits. (10) Rayed Issa Kamaluddin has made over a pamphlet posted in Ahwaz but purporting to emanate from a Kashanzadeh in Tehran calling on all true Musulmans to have the bazar closed as a protest against the offence caused by British attempts to arrest Rayed Abul Qasera Kashani in Tehran. No further copies of the pamphlet have been seen and no attempt has been made to close the bazars. IV. Bconomic . (n) The supply of government bread in Ahwaz town remains excellent. Rome complaints of short weight have been received and Mr. Rolomon has come to the conclusion that the profit allowed to the bakers is so small that without a degree of supervision which he cannot maintain these malpraetises on the part of the bakers are inevitable. Cheap government bread is also being issued in the provincial towns of Dizful, °hushtar and Ram Hormuz;the quantities issued are so small and the /that protests so few;/it is impossible to escape the conclusion that the majority oi townspeople must have considerable private stocks of grain and believe that they will be able to renew their stocks without much difficulty. ,! ( 12 ) The sugar barter scheme is gathering momentum and in * the Ahwaz area, where ^ugar is now being given agaisnt deliveries for which undertakings had been made, the grain is coming in faster than at any time before; the airibars intended for deliveries in the rural areas are reported to be working to the limit of their capacity. Tribal raids in the Ram Hormuz area have reduced the progress of the barter scheme there; this is unfortunate as this area was let off very lightly in the assess ment for undertakings and large quantities of grain will it is hoped become available after the end of Ramadhan&lt;&gt; In the Kindijan area, where the disruption of a black market led the land-owners to deliver more grain than they were forced to do according to . their undertakings, probably little surplus grain remains. In Dizful the prospects are not good largely as the result of existence of an enormous black market in the neighbouring town of Andimeshk which can hardly be 'sealed' without talcing on the ‘ immediately impossible task of feeding the town. Elsewhere the prospects are good and Mr. Solomon has a reasonable chance of securing the three thousand tons of grain required in addition tc what has already been collected for feeding the towns of Khuzistan until the next harvest. (3.3) With reference to para 24 of the last Ahwaz diary, the raids on the hoards in the Arab villages produced a stir. Colonel Humayuni forwarded to the Governor-General a tendencioug and Inaccurate report about one of the raids and offered the gratui tous advice that such action would be bad for future grain collec tion; whatever the legal status of the hoards, Colonel Humayuni' 3- 3 - action oeanus to lend weight to the previous reports that he had interfered in grain collection. (14) A fact that has recently emerged sheds a new light on Agha Nafisi s activities in Khuzistan. Ainong the under takings which were to guarantee the food supply of Khuzistan appeared five hundred tons from ^usangird. It now aupears that no regular undertakings were given in the area at all and the only Jbasis for Agha Nafisi’p report was a vague promise hy the head &gt;f the Finance Department in &lt;nigangird, who, according to hi s own statement, had to hring in a very considerahle proportion of the 150 tons delivered through the marshes from Iraq 0 (15) According to the latest information about the strength of Persian troops in Khuzistan, the Persian forces’ estimate of 24S0 tons of grain required until the next harvest is grossly excessive; setting aside the provision of barley xor animals - apparently one of the more notorious sources of { income for Persian officers - and allowing 800 grammes of wheat daily to each man, the estimate is almost 1000 tons in exess. An additional ground for suspicion is that the military have demanded that almost two thirds of the wheat be delivered in Ahwaz and Ram Hormuz, which between them contain a considerably smaller proportion of the total Persian forces in Khuzistan, and further enquiries are being made. V. Tribal - Bakhtiari (16) The plan for the reoccupation of the Janiki country'' has been changed after the visit to Khuzistan of the ilinister of War* It was apparently felt that even if the- column from iw ^cessful in re occupying Izeh, the majority of the Chaharlang recalcitrants would escape in the direction of the Bardsir; it was therefore decided to send another column from Isfahan into the Bardsir to flush the tribe towards the Khuzistan column in the Garinsir* VI. Tribal - Kuhgilu &gt; i- 7 !, In ? he f ir st part of the fortnight, the Zarghaxnpur faction was circulating the rumour that the Persian govsrnm^n* th2v«?J? rr ? nde I*! t0 the ^qai and Bakhtiarihad proirlseV' th^Kalantan ofthe Kuhgilu together with Zaidun to Abdullah Khan who would remove conscription, taxation and all other pigns J 0 £ the central government. The meeting between rtnnf+? inpUr T an + Ge] ?eral Ahmedi at Ardekan on 24th Beptember has doubtless lent weight to the propaganda and contributed to the nervousness of the minor chieftains forming the anti-Zarghampur inti in*. . ^ he ^ in ister of War during his visit to Khuzistan outlined his plans for dealing with the Kuhgilu tribes.

In return the General paid him Rials 10,000 down and promised him Rials 5,000 a month for the maintenance of his tufangchis. (On ’’active service” the tufangchis were promised pay at gendarmerie rates and provisions.) Rais-ut-Tujjar is doubtless paying an additional unofficial subsidy sufficiently '\arge to make tiese terms worth while. (SO) Xhusrow, brother of Abdullah Khan Zarghampur, who is very reasonably suspicious of the Persian government’s intentions towards him after the Ardekan conversations, received a similar payment and similar promises. His supporter, Muzaffar Khan Ariani, apparently had to be content with a medal. (21} A force of Teibi has been encamped in Tashan fifteen miles north of Behbahan since the raid reported in para 31 of the last diary. Even after the withdrawal of the Persian troops from their line of attack they made no further move against the Behbahan villages - possibly because they were regarded as Khalili’s perquisite. The Teibi situation is now uncertain. The Persian military plan was to move first against them, Rais-ut-Tajjar is almost certainly able and willing to buy off the Teibis and the Persian military, with Khalili’s help, could almost certainly clean out the Teibi Garmsir, As the Teibi chief Zarghami did not come in during General Ahmedi’^ visit the Persian military will find it difficult to avoid taking a ’’strong line” which might well provide the Boir Ahmed ^arhaddis with a chance to inflict a blow on the Persian forces- (22) The news that the Qavam proposed to provide Malek Mansur, the Basht Bavi would-be chieftain, with 500 rifles caused considerable consternation In Khuzistan, This shifty youth is to a very large extent under the influence of Hussain Quli Rustomi who has recently married his son to Zargharnpur' s daughter and Colonel Humayuni’s protests at arming Malek Mansur are extremely intelligible, (23) The villages of Salim ana Dehkak near Ram Hormuz have been raided by Behmai of the Aliudini subsection during the fortnight. The robbers took nothing except livestock, but the raids have added to the general uneasiness of the area, VII. Tribal - Arab , (24) The religious leader Caid Issa Kamaluddin - compare para 26 of the diary for the first half of July - left for Iraq before the end of Ramadhan without going through the usual passport formalities. He ip reported to be somewhat disillusioned with the continued ’’oppression” of the Arabs by the military and the entirely worldly manoeuvres of the sheikhs in connection with the elections. (25) The outlaw Jabbar of Zargan - see para 32 of the diary for the first half of August - has been writing letters to wealthy Arabs demanding sums of ten thousand tumans and upwardsi in default he threatens to sack their villages with the aid cf the Chaharlang ho^tiles with whom he has taken refuge. Jabbar also addressed a letter to H.Mc Consul-General protesting his obedience to the British government, but swearing that he would leave no peace in Khuzistan unless he were made repponsible for Its security. (He added the rather starling statement that ”ail the Bakhtiari khans” would support him in maintaining security*) Apparently the Arabs do not take his threats very seriously, for his family have given a bond of Rials 60,000 to secure the return of the government rifles in Jabber’s hands within the fortnight and the son of Haji Munaished has also given security of half a f /millionmillion rials for the appearance of Jabber'* family at the end of the fortnight. * ( 36 ) General Ahrnedi addressed an assembly of sheilchs of . Khuzistan on 27th September, lie is reported to have been affable and to have stressed the point that the Arabs were Persian subjects and therefore entitled to all the privileges of jEjr Persian citizens, he raised an unconcealed laugh when, while ^Mnting out to the Beni Turuf sheikhs the benefit* of education, he *aid that a* a result of schooling in ;5urope and xehran, leading positions were now occupied by ”their neighbours, the Bakhtiari*’. VIII. Tribal - Luristan . ( 37 ) it is reported that the ZALIKI are raiding in the CHAM SULTAN area, and that the raiders are in partnership with KHAWJ3H MEHTI QULI. ALI TULALWAND went to Isfahan in connection with this matter at the end of September and before leaving asked me to press for operations to be undertaken against the Kj 1AV/J73H, as he feared a possible flare up of tribal trouble if no thing were done to curb him. (28) It is reported that shooting incident* on to Railway have slightly lessened in numbers. (29) It is reported that an American lorry was shot a,t and one man killed in the Rezan Pass. The lorry was travelling after dark and unaccompanied contrary to orders. (30) The struggle between All Mohammad Gazanfari and his cousin Amanullah for Tarhan continues. It isthought that soon a shooting incident will be arranged which will be the signal for the recall of Amanullah. ( 31 ) sarun-us-sultaneh asked for assistance in regaining some of his father’s, the late Wall of Pu*htekuh, property. The sarun is living quietly in Khomain with Abbas Mirza hishmati. A IX;. Elections . (32) Abdul Aziz Farzali,Abdur Rezaq Ka’abi and Abdul Hassan Ka’abi, three sheikhs of Khorramshahr, who had been summoned to Ahwaz to meet the Minister of War, stated that Colonel Humayuni had canvassed their support for Neqabat in Khorramshahr. To judge from the entertainment lavished on the sheikhs by Neqabat him*elf and the free use they enjoyed of the Municipality’s car (the Director of the Municipality is a brother of the candidate) the report i* well-founded. The sheikhs stated that Neqabat's failure to further their interests during the time he previously represented Khorramshahr was due to 'the regime' and that his knowledge of their need* made him preferable to any other candidate who had appeared. (33) Dr. Hussain Parhoudi, who was Director of Education in Khuzistan in 1935, reappeared on 26th September and announced his intention of standing for Da*ht-i-Mishan. He claims that he has persuaded sheikh ^artip, the Beni Turuf candidate not to stand and has gained his support for himself. The Beni Turuf, are reported, conceivably as consequence of these negotiations, to have found a new candidate in Abdullah Atishqadeh, a contractor of Khorramshahr who is favourably known to the Beni Turuf. (34) It is confirmed that Qasim Fuladwand has been returned for the All Godarz seat of Burujird, and Dr. Itibar for the town veal* (S5) At Gulpaigan the election went in favour of Abdul /WuassiniMuaszimi but have been suspended, ^ome eourcee report the reason is that Muazzimi is too pro-Bakhtiari. The*real reason is not known, nor is it known what instructions the new Farmandar SHAHESDI has received,. Abbas (36) At Khomeiq/Mirza complains bitterly that the influence born of the wealth of Khosrawani is likely to deprive him of ~'iie right to be elected. The Mirza is reported to have put a good deal of money up, but he cannot compete with Khograwani who, according to the Mirza, together with Kohbud and Batman- galich have givefa the Prime Minister a quarter of a million tomans tat for a Gilan seat and those of MALAYER and MAHALLAT. There is not necessarily any truth in the statement and if there is, possibly exaggeration, but it serves to show the huge bribery figures would-be candidates think in. (37) In Sultanabad, in all probability KHAK BAZ and jSZATULLAH BAYAT will be returned. The former's 'expenses* fcmount to 58,000 tomans, and the latter's 30,000 tomans according to a certain source. The Tudeh party pasted up placards giving the chief of police’s share as 10,000 tomans. A further placard was prepared but was found before it could be la sued.According to report it is being distributed in Tehran. X. soviet Interests . (38) The Soviet Consul and Vice-Consul paid a visit at the begining of the month to 7 usangird, where with the help of the Bakhphdar they made contact with some of the sheikhs visited the frontier at Pakkeh and returned to Ahwaz via Koweizah. The Vice-Consul followed this up with a visit on 23rd September where he visited the hous-e of Sheikh Lufteh in the company of the Bakhshdar and the Officer Commanding gendarmerie and asked a number of questions about tribal organisation and economic conditions among the Beni Turuf. After spending the night with the Bakhshdar he visited the school and enquired details about the number of students and teachers and the latters' salaries. He took numerous photos of the town and sheikhs in Arab dress. (The latter affected religious objections and refused to pose except with the Persian officials, much, it is reported, to the latter’s annoyance.) (39) The Governor-General reported that sheikh ^artip had approached him for instructions as to what reply he should make to the Soviet Vice-Consul who was always asking to visit Sajptip’s house in Ahwaz. The Governor-General stated that he had advised prolonged procrastination. °gd. A.C. GALLOWAY H. M.CONSUL-GSNSEAL. Maximum shade temperature ISO 0 ?. Minimum ' ' 58°F. Rainfall Nil.

XXX. (12) With reference to para 19 of Ahwaz diary for the first fortnight in July, the Commissioner of Police reports that he has received instructions from Tehran to reestablish the police post at Andimeshk. (13) The ,, ,, ' '/*&gt;■**-*)(13) The gendarmeries in U*tan VI are now in charge of Colonel Ishqi. Colonel I*hqi wa&lt;? formerly in command of the Khuzijstan gendarmerie; hi?? record offers little hope that he will be abler or more willing than hi* predeces^or.cyix&amp;mta Colonel Ishqi reports that the whole of Railway Gendarmerie al^o has been placed under his command, (14) Tension over religious questions appears to be growing though there is no indication that this has any connec tion with the propaganda reported in para 10 of the last diary. On 7th October sheikh Jaffar Ansari, perhaps the leading Mujtahid of Ahwaz, reported that iiohd Ali Imam, president of the Hezb- i- /sent Azadigan, had/xsKH him by the hand of a member of the Hezb a copy of a pamphlet attacking Islam; the youth was slightly man-handled by the disciples of the Mujtahed who claimed that his interven tion had prevented the boy receiving serious injury. (The pamphlet which, though appearing over Imam f s signature, is popu larly attributed to sayyed Ahmed Kasravi, has a strongly reformist’ flavour and an element of xenophobia.) (15) On the evening of 9th October the wife of a sergeant of gendarmerie rushed out into a crowded street and began to scream that her young daughter had been kidnapped by the Jews for ceremonial sacrifice. A crowd of seven or eight hundred collected and went off to burn the synagogue. They were prevented from so doing by the Commissioner of Police who drove off the mob by firing his pistol into the air. He later' produced the woman along with a girl alleged to be her kidnapped daughter and persuaded the mob to disperse. The mob in then reported to have made an abortive attempt to attack the house of Imam. The reason for the latter incident is not clear, though the mob is alleged to have been &amp;gged on by a woman who was the mooher of boy manhandled by the supporters of the mujtahid. (16) A quarrel is reported between the Director of the Municipality and the Governor-General largely over the question of the repair of the road joining the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co, centre at Khazalieh and Ahwaz town. The road was constructed by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. some four years age and taken over on completion by the Ministry of Road since when no maintenance has been done and the road has become the worst in Kiiuzistan. The Governor-General had apparently made it a point of honour to have the road repaired forthwith and refused to accept the Director’s plea that he could do nothing as the road was outside municipal limits.! His resignation having been refused, he has applied for ten days leave in Tehran to canvass, according to popular report, for his brother who seeks re-election in Khorramshahr. (17) The public health authorities report four cages of ciptheria in October, three of them fatal. (18) The Ittehadiyeh Kargaran-i-Khuzistan held its first considerable public meeting on 8 th October. Nouzar Ashour, the Tehran speaker advertised, did not appear and his deputy, one Ali Umid, harangued an audience of about one thousand labourers. Disavowing all connection with the Allies, he told them their founder, one Yusuf, had attempted to found the movement gome | thirteen years before while he was an employee of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Co. in Abadan but had ended up in prison as a result of the machinations of his employers. The intervention of the police saved the speaker from bodily harm, IV. Economic . I (19) The bread in Ahwaz town remains excellent and it is &gt; /difficultdifficult to 'believe that it contains now something over 15% 'barley. The percentage of barley mu.et, however, gradually he increased from now onwards as the proposal to exchange barley with wheat from the north - compare para 15 of the diary for the second fortnight of August - has apparently been turned down. (30) The improvement expected after the end of Ramazan in deliveries of wheat against sugar has been realised. Up to 15th tober Mr. Solomon reports that 575 tons of v/heat have been delivered against sugar. In the Ahwaz area, progress is only maintained at the cost of continual pressure on the sheilths and Arab kadkhodas, but elsewhere the prospects are improving; in the Hindijan area, where little surplus grain was thought to be left, almost a hundred tons have been delivered, and the result-* in Ram Hormuz and ^hushtar are promising. Out of the thirty lorries assigned to the area, however, fifteen are being taken away; this i* unfortunate, since, in order to ensure the food supplies of the towns until the next harvest, a further 2000 odd tons will have to be collected during the next six weeks. At the end of this period the government price falls by one third and all wheat collected thereafter, except for the 8 am small quantities that may be forthcoming as a result of optimism over (hypothe tical) early rains, will require extreme pressure* (Sl)-r A compromise has now been found which, it is hoped, will enable the towns of Andimeshk and Khorramshahr to be ’’sealed” and so prevent the drain of wheat from Dizful and Ahwaz respectively, without undertaking the impossible task of provi ding the entire population of both towns with bread. In both towns the majority of the adult population is employed by the allied forces and has therefore not only considerable quantities of money but receives both legally and illegally generous supplies of ration flour. It is now proposed to open in each town government shops selling barley bread at Rials 5 per kilo, thus enabling the very poor to get cheap bread but discouraging.by the somewhat unpalatable article offered,other sections of the population starting a run on the cheap supplies with which the government stocks could not cope. (82) The threatened resignation of Dr. Millspaugh and his American assistants in Tehran has had surprisingly rapid reper cussions in Ahwaz. The Pishkar received towards the end of September instructions from Dr. Millspaugh giving Mr. *olomon complete authority over all matters connected with the collection of grain and the provision of bread. Mr. Solomon reports, however, that when he ordered. Aghai Ashouri, officer in charge of the local finance Department, -to make over fifty tons o.f grain for the Persian staff of the Iranian state Railway, Aghai Ashouri replied that he had been instructed by the Pishkar not to make any deliveries without the Pishkar 1 s instructions and in his absence was unable to take any action. (23) With reference to para 15 of the last Ahwaz diary, it now appears that the admittedly excessive amounts of grain promised to the Persian forces represent the price paid for the Army’s agreement not to compete with the Kharobar in the grain market. V. Wheat Collections . (34) In cnaltanabad undertakings have been received for 7200 ton,s. There are still many landlords who have not given undertakings and|they have been warned that they mu*t come and give undertakings before the 20th Mehr or the Kharobar will fix the amount of grain which they have to deliver. Up to the end of .^hahrivar 18 ,7 4 tons of wheat and barley had been purchased and the stock in the sultanabad anbar and the collecting centres was 790 tonsc in the /first- 4 /wheat /leave fir pt ten days of Mehr 547 ton^ were purchased and the stock at the end of that period was 1062 tons, of which 363 tons wa in the hu it anal) ad anhar and the rest in the collecting centre p. Up to the end of Shahrivar the amount of- grain 'brought from the collecting centres to the city was 552 tons* In the first ten days of Mehr 247 tons were 'brought in 9 'bringing the total to 798 tonsa The stock at Hhahzand, except for about 5 tons being milled daily and brought to the city as mo.pt of the city mills are not yet working, is to be transported by rail to Tehran* For the transport of the rest to Hultanabad there are 21 Pool lorries working; 30 having been received altogether, but four having gone to Tehran for repair^ and five having been sent to transport to Thonsar the 600 ton^ of wheat being supplied from the collec ting centres of the Ourje and Karchambu districts of Isfahan* *The Pool trucks have now been placed under the control of the Kharobar and their work has improved; but there are still many ’’breakdowns' and much illicit carrying of freight and passengers* (25) Wheat is being sold in the city at 500 tertians a ton to householders who surrender their coupons, 319 tons having been sold by the 10th Mehr 0 The amount of flour issued daily to the bakeries is about 14 tons* Wheat is also being supplied to the Railways and to the employees of the sugar factory at Shahzand: and 150 tons of barley has been sent to Kaghan, The flour being supplied to the city bakeries is whole/flour* The discovery that wheat at the collecting centre at Tureh was not being properly cleaned before being sent to thv mills and contained a large number of small stones, has led to an improve ment in the bread; which previously, though otherwise of good quality, contained a considerable quantity of grit. ( 20 ) In Gulpaigan , at the end of Rhahrivar, undertakings had been received for 143 tons at Gulpaigan and 630 in Xhomain; of which 72 tons had been collected in Gulpaigan and 184 rons in Khomain., It is estimated that Gulpaigan will collect enough to feed itself (a little over 500 tons) and that undertakings in Xhomain will amount to about 800 tons, which 7 ,/ill/a small surplus over its own requirements ? At Khonsar a start has been made in transporting from the collecting centres in Gurjo and Karchambu of the 600 tons which has been allotted to Khonsar from the collections of these districts of Isfahan; and five Pool trucks from nultanabad have now been sent to complete delivery before the winter* (27) In Buru,1 ir d undertakings received amounted to 1439 tons at the end of ghahrivar and amount to 1636 tons up to date (to 16th Mehr), This is still less than half the target figure of 4000 tons. Up to dcate 730 tons have 'been purchased and the stock in Burujird itself is 410 tons of wheat and 27 tons of barley» There are 5 pool trucks bringing in the grain from the collecting centres at Dorud, Chalan Chulan and Ushtarinah; and 60 hired camels bringing it from the collecting centre at norenjeh* (28) From Ali Gudar z Dr, Amampur reports that he has now obtained undertakings for 6000 tons and that 1000 tons have 'been collected at Ezna, Marzian and Imamzadeh Qasim for transport to Tearan, These figures appear to me to be susrtcicusly round* {2^) Undertakings 3600 tons having been been fixed by the Comm Ali Gudarz, 850 tons a Imamzadeh Qasim, Five at Ali Gudarz amount to 4100 tons; those for given voluntarily and those for 1500 having ission* Purchases amount to about 600 tons at t lizna, 230 tons at Marzian and 150 tons at Pool trucks have been received, of which one /was taking$ UMO) wa« taking wheat from Imam*cdeh to ?ovzieh station, one from Marzian to Mamun station and two from All Gudarz to ]?zna station: the fifth being employed in taking bag* and petrol to the collec ting centre* from All Gudarz, ]?zna or 'ultanabad. As, however, the anbar at Marzian hap a capacity of about 4000 ton* and the road from there to Mamun ip open moet of the year, the truck working there ip being pent til Imamzadeh, po that pufficient wheat can bo taken to Fovzieh daily to fill one wagon. After ^ much time, trouble and telephoning to Tehran wagonp have at lapt been allotted and one daily ip to be placed at Eznu, ^'ovsieh and ^hahzand ptationp. Accomodation ip being provided for about 60 tonp in the warehouse at each of the station*, po that there may always be a reserve and wagons may not be delayed ^/C. L. 0 . by occasional breakdowns in the motor transport. When /_ visited the collecting centres on the 12 th the quantities of wheat cleaned and bagged ready for transport were 50 tons at Iraamzadeh and l^ovzieh, 100 tons at Marzian and Mamun and 180 tons at 3zna. (30) The large quantities being delivered at All Gudarz itself indicate that collections from Borborud are better than they were last year, Robberies and tribal unrest are, however, inter fering with collections from the area to the south of Ali Gudarz. Gendarmes sent to this area have been robbed of their rifles and Government employees of their horses. The Zaleghi are mainly blamed for this, but some of the stolen property has been ’’recovered' by Khajeh Mehdi Ghuli and it is suspected that he is in league with the robbers and returning some of the property in order to keep in with Government at the same time. It is said that troops are to be sent to attempt to keep order in the area. The- 600 tons which Khajeh Mehdi Ghuli undertook to collect and deliver from his area has been apportioned among the various families or tribes and the Khajeh has delivered 30 tons on hip own account but it seems possible he will not be able to collect the rest. (31) Taqi Ruladwand is assisting Dr. Amampur in collecting the wheat, by his influence with the landlords and by the provision of men, more reliable than the Kharbar employees, to prevent the removal of wheat from the area. Dr. Amampur wishes to have him officially appointed as his assistant and I think that this might be helpful. (38) There have been no more complaints against Dr. Amampur and at least some of the landlords who had paid money have had itreturned to them. I have proposed that Dr. Amampur should remain at Ali Gudarz. The situation on the whole is satisfactory. VI. Tribal - Bakhtiari . (33) Representatives of Morteza Quli Khan are reported to have arrived in Izeh where they have been visited by the Chaharlang hoptiles. The hostiles are said to have promised obedience to Morteza Quli and full restitution for the events of last spring. VII. Tribal - Kuhgilu . (34) Abdullah Khan Zarghampur is reported to have arrived at Ludab a point near Gherom, from where he is sending a spate of messengers to the numerous small tribes with whom he will be in contact in the winter. Meanwhile Zarghampur seems to have been having trouble among the ^arhaddi. The quarrel between him and Mohd. Hussain Tahery has apparently been patched up, but the notorious Ali and Vali, who are commonly believed to be the power behind the throne in Tali Khusrovi, are expected in Behbahan within the next- few days bringing with them their rival candidate for the kalantari of the Xuhgiln, the youthful son of Ghulam Hua*ain Tahery. Ghulara AZi Tomraddi, the rival of Qaid ^asir /BahadurBahadur in that aubpeetion, and two important kadlchodag of the Agnai subjection, all of whom had been imprisoned by Zarghampur, are reported to have effected their escape and to be making for Aru. (35) The Behmai negotiations also seem to be going wel-L. On 14th October ivlohd. All Khalili brought Karim Khan, a leo-der of the Alaudini subsection, and sultan Ali Razmju of* x-he ^Mohammedi, into Behbahan; all the important sections of the .jehmai are thus in contact with the Persian authorities. (36) With reference to para 19 of the last diary, R-azan, the landlord of Jaizan, is reported to have returned to has; estate and Mohd A'li Khan Khalili to have invited the villagers of Jaizan to Xhltak to identify and take back their stolen property. (37) It now appears that a face-saver may have been found for the Persian authorities which will enable them to avoid military action ^against the Teibi - compare para 21 of the last diary - a* Ahmad iviajidi, a kadkhoda of the Teibi Garmsiri, saw General Ahmedi ”on behalf of Mohd Hus«ain Zarghami”. During the first week of the month, certainly, a collision took place between the Teibi from Tashan and the garrison left by i/lohd Ali Khan Khalili at Do Dungeh. No loss of property was reported, but one kadkhoda was killed. On 5th October a mission containing Rais-ut- Tu;jar's son, Ahmed Majidi and other minor tribal leaders, succeeded in making contact with the Teibis.* who thereafter dispersed. Ahmed Majidi has been sent to Zarghami with encoura ging message* and Rais-ut-Tujjar is confident that hi« overture^ will be well received. According to an unconfirmed report of 15tn October, Zarghami was on hip way in to Behbahan when he was intercepted by a messenger from Abdullah Khan Zarghampur asking him not to proceed until they had a chance for discussion. ^38) Malek Mansur is reported to have arrived in Basht. As he has apparently returned without government rifles, his mission \pq\i 1 q appear to have been unsuccessful. A disinterested observer said that the unfortunate Malek Mansur would doubtless wish that Pahlevi had murdered him when he had to face Khanum Bibi without his rifles. (39) Isfandiar Adish is reported to have been sent to Behbahan by the Dushmanziari asking for help against the Bcir Ahmed, ^arhaddis who are said to be contemplating a return oc their sardsir through Dushmanziari territory. VIII. Tribal - Arab (40) from sheikh Humedan Ka’abi of i v ^hadegan, who recently returned raq, reported that Ghassib, son of the late ^heikn of io hammer ah, v/as trying to obtain permission through the regular^ channels to return to Iran. His wife and family are said io oe it Tehran pleading on his behalf. Abdul Karim, the prosperous brother of the’family, is reported to be opposing Chassib s application. (41) Jabbar’s family - compare para 25 of the last Ahwaz diary - has apparently come to the conclusion that they will not be able to secure the return of the government rifles with which Jabbar decamped and have repented giving the security of Rials 60,000 to this effect. They have accordingly represented that thay entered into the bond under duress and have requested that Jabbar be ’’summoned” under the auspices of British authorities* In the meantime Jabbar has not implemented any of his blackmai- threats. (42) Unconfirmed reports of a series of raids on the west of the Ahushtar- 7 - qhuelitar Mianab have been received. Further north, fiowaro of the Chenaneh are reported to have sacked Buneh safar, one id of the outlying villages of Daiincheh; thip raid i.« said to have been retaliation against the Kalantari-farnily, one of whom had taken the Officer Commanding Gendarmerie into Chenaneh territory in search of stolen cattle. The American*are reported by Lieut- Colonel Noel to have arrested sheikh Alwan as the road in his area had been the scene of a series of thefts. (43) Late reports state that Colonel Hurnayuni has addressed letters to Barrak, chief of the Bavi, and to five other leading sheikhs, stating that he is satisfied that they are u supporting” Jabbar, and that unless Jabbar is brought in within the fortnight they themselves will be imprisoned. (44) Cehnaneh Arabs raided Kushkak, a village on the Karun north of ehushtar, at the beginning of the month, and drove off sixteen buffaloes. As the raiders had at leapt twenty farsakhs of ’’foreign” territory to pass through, the success of the raid argues a high degree of local cooperation, IX , Tribal - buristan . (45) The fortnight under report has been distinguished by the absence of sniping or hold-ups on railway or road. X. Slections . (46) In Dizful the elections have been completed and although the results have not been announced it is common knowledge that Amir Jang has been successful. (47) In the Ahwaz-nhushtar-RamHormuz constituency the anjuman-i nuzzar was constituted on 12th October, ^.adeq Bushiri and Dr. Jezairi are reported to have withdrawn from the contest and as Aghai Khajavi apparently made no objection to Aghai Nasseri accompanying the Governor-General’s party to ^huphtar it seems that Aghai Xhajavi too has decided not to stand. (Dr. Ali Abadi, the Hamrahan candidate, stated that it was only the company that he was in that prevented Aghai Nasseri being stoned on his arrival in ^hushtar.) (48) The fate of the Dasht-i-i/Iishan constituency is still undecided, Aghai Neqabat professes to find it inconsistent with cept hi« dignity to stand anywhere/in his own constituency of Khorram- shahr and indeed his chances would seem to be better there than in Dasht-i-Mishan. Rais-ut-Tujjar, though formerly extremely preo ccupied with tribal affairs in Behbahan, arrived in Ahwaz on 14th October and will stand if not discouraged. (49) The Behbahan ke elections, according to the Governor- General, av/ait only the arrival of a civil governor. Ahwaz, 24th October, 1943 qgd. A.C. GALLOWAY. H.

Colonel Hurnayuni, Officer Commanding 10th (Xhuzistan) Division, went to Ram Hormuz on 17th October to meet Timur Khan Isfandiari, Morteza Quli Xhan'^ nominee for the Bakhshdari of Izeh. Timur Khan came to Ahwaz on 31st October. ( 6 ) The Governor-General visited Khorramshahr and Abadan on 24th October and returned to Ahwaz on 27th October.

General. Vith reference to para 12 of the last diary, the instruc tions to reestablish the police post at Andimeshk have proved unfructuous. V/hen the police were withdrawn, the gendarmerie gratefully occupied the police station and now n in the absence of instructions from Tehran” refuse to vacate the buildings. (13; Colonel Ishqi has made over charge of the gendarmerie to ^b-T' tac!]iari ’ frile i^tr^ctions for reducing the strength oi the Behbahan companies are reported to have been cancelled, (compare para 8 of the diary for the second half of September.) (I 4 )* T ^ e Governor-General has given a fuller account of his quarrel with the Director of the Municipality. The Governor-General esinng to demonstrate the inefficiency of the municipality, '%** • /seized2 seized a 'broom from one of the swee^, office (which is next door to the British Consulate) commenced to raise clouds of dust from the pavement per s/in v* 'i 4- -i''h Secretary of the Soviet Consulate had come to the Municicali tv to enquire -why the Governor-General had found it neces^y^v 'to' * sweep the pavement in frontof the British Consulate, 'The' remark went round the town with such speed that the Governor- General had little doubt that the Director was trying to hold h m uv to derision. The Governor-General acted with the game eneed as he did in the Behbahani affair and had Neqabnt out in'a few hourso (15) The Governor-General expressed great perturbation over one of ohe incidental results of setting up an independent^ military governorship in Abadan; in order to avoid 'budget difficulties it had been proposed to abolish the gove^norate of Khorramshahr and net up in its place a bakhshdari mb ordinate to the military governor of Abadan, The obvious disadvantages of this arrangement to administration (except on the Abadan island) have been pointed out and the Governor—General now reports that an agreement has seen reached between the parties interested by which the go ve mo rate of Khomamphahr wi'd remain undisturbed and the report to the Governor- admin is trat ion, (16) The Governor- that the General Manage duration of the W: mil itary governor of Aba da • w 1 1 .l. .L _L General on matters con nee ted wi - h »i.L civil Gener i al has stated to H« M o Cons' l f—1 . j General r of the Anglo-Iranian 01 nag under- town s e lectric plant in order : :br the then eaf ter to supply cur rent f; :.v the (1^) Aghai Rais-ut-Tujjar reports that Abri«homkar ana Abri?Komk A v thQ other three merchants exiled from Khuzistan for attempted in ^own bread supply are still s(^ 9 nding momy in No*. ooth Ahwas and Tehran to procure permission to return* ie ^ pc ^&lt;1oc alp0 paid that th6 failure of the' speculators' lobbying n Tehran convinced public opinion that the British had been i*T 66 ; 7 /p responsiole for their original expulsion and that if they were now allowed to return the British should see that they csemselves and not ohe recipients of the douceurs got the credit.

(31) Mr. Morton ?, Solomon, who hag now taken ov^r the office of Director of Finance, hag found, a* might be expected, that the general organisation of the department need* drastic changes and the distribution of *ugar, tea, and cloth in particular requires revision. He proposes to take the distri bution out of the hands of the private merchants who formerly retailed these goods—allegedly under the ’'supervision” of the Economic Department—and to sell them in government shops* He is also understood to have asked for the cancellation of the monopoly of the tobacco syndicate whose profiteering is the main current scandal in Ahwaz. (22) A commission from the Ministry of Finance under Aghai Behnia, head of the Department of Domains, and professor Winsor, the American irrigation expert, hap finished ten days enquiries at Hamidieh and Ahu Dapht. It is understood that a budget of twelve or fourteen millicm will be recommended including capital expenditure of about four million to enable the scheme to carry on. V. Tribal—Bakhtiari . (23) Colonel Hurnayuni is expected to return from Isfahan with approved plans for the cleaning up of the Janeki country* and Timur Khan Isfandiari, Morteza Quli’s representative in Iseh, awaits Colonel Humayuni’s return in Ahwaz. Farajullah Khan Kiani has been left behind ap a Kais-i-Intezamat in Izeh, where Nader Quli, leader of the Bakhtiari tufangchis, is also paid to be waiting for instructions. Timur’s very natural prejudice against turning over outlaws to the Persian authorities does not augur well for the sucess of the Janeki operations; Timur admitted to H.i.l. Consul-General that he had been visited by the Arab outlay; pc.sc. Jabbar and when asked why he had not arrested Jabbar made the tD-w extraordinary statement that he had not realised who Jabbar was. VI. Tribal--Kuhgilu . (24) ^he roads have been quiet during the fortnight and there have no major developments among the tribes though there i has been a flood of conflicting rumour about the 'recognition” of Zargharnpur. Ali and Vali finally decided against throwing in their lot on the side of the authorities and it is reported that they have invited Khusrow and Qalb Ali to go to Cherorn with a view to making their pease with Zargharnpur. Muzaffar Khan Ariani is clearly perturbed by the development and hints that his backers will probably accept the invitation but only witil a view to securing the release of their wives who are now in Zarghampur' s hands as well a* of securing the v/ithdrawal of Zargham from Dil. (25) Mohd Ali Khan Khalili—see para 19 of the diary for the - half of September—has not, according to statements by the landlord of Jaizun, carried out hip promise of returning the rifles taken from the estate tufangchis and the property looted from the villagers; Razavi says that only about a tenth of the looted cattle and sheep and none of household property taken has been returned. Razavi is doubtless somewhat embittered as he has been forced to sign a bond undertaking within twenty days to secure the return of the rifles taken from hi* tufangchis * or^to forfeit Rials 60,000 to Colonel Ishqi. It is generally believed .that the eight rifles in question are now in Khalili’s hands and that the Persian authorities know this but, instead of pressing for the return of the rifles, prefer that Razavi should /contribute pfv-f A.

( 2 v). Malek Hansur has again been fishing in troubled waters and is reported to have sent iTIarnasani sowars to the aid of Zarghampur’s_supporters in Dil. This report is probably connected with the activities of the relations of some of the children murdered by i/ialek Mansur in July (see para 23 of the diary for 15th-31st July); they are reported to have taken up positions astride the Jo dumbedan—Bashtroad with the intention of looting all Basht Bawl -caravans.

Elections. $&lt;xcU&lt;9 'HmjsI'HYI /Aqliai Nassev! r,c i' &lt;s*tc (35) The elections in the Ahwaz constituency have not yet begun, with the result that action in the 'connected'* consti tuencies of Dasht-i-Mishan and Khorramphahr had al^o to be postponed. The. Governor-General was so impressed by the storm of protest aroused by the likelihood of Aghai Napseri being re-elected as well as by the case of 'undue influence' that was being manufactured against him, that Aghai Nasseri wap persuaded to withdraw. Dr.Jezairi is canvassing and ^adiq Bushiri has returned. Two other active candidate^ are Majid Alavi, and Ali Ahadi an d Ameri. (36) Neqabat ? s temporary retirement from the contest in Xhorramshahr, leaving the Hamrahan candidate, Dr. Radji, alone in the field and rejoicing that he was getting a 'fair chance' at last. Neqabat’s return to the contest has caused renewed complaints from Dr. Radji that every man's hand is against him. Certainly the Arabs and the better sort of Persians are against him. ^gd. A,C.

(7) Hormuz Khan Ahmedi, de facto proprietor of the estate of Zaidun, arrived in Khuzistan on 10th November to visit his estates.

( 9 ) Nith reference to para IT of the last diary, the sec Ixt 66 /o/ exiled hoarder Abrishornkar arrived in Ahwaz on 14th November. , Two days previously the Persian broadcast from London i r - reported to have attributed the relatively satisfactory condition of bread supplies in Khuzistan largely to the prompt expulsion of Abrishomkar and his associates. (10) The preliminaries of the °hushtar Irrigation Project, believed to be the only commercial irrigation project on a considerable scale in Iran, have now been completed by Colonel Noel. The company has a capital of two and half million rials and proposes to resuscitate the ancient Bari&amp;n canal which irrigates 2400 hectares of wheat and barley and 300 hectares of rice land. The improvements are expected to produce each year an additional 200 tons of wheat and barley and 350C tons of rice and other summer crops. In order to avoid having to collect a share of the crops from the threshing floor and becoming entangled with the duties of a landlord, Colonel Noel agreed to a relati vely light water rate. As the Bar/ian canal at present carries a certain amount of water for irrigating winter crops and the istHdkisxd landowners could therefore argue that no rate was leviable on winter crops, more delicate negotiation was involved; it was finally agreed that no rate should be levied on winter crops but that all landlords participating should sow one khi?h /of summer- 2 of RUirimer oropp, on which the water rate every khig h of winter cropg sown. These taken gome of the 'financial gilt off the ginger-bread' the short-sighted Persian investors* point of view, and would he paid, for concessions have from Colonel See fx^ce, k'*T 66 ( 0 ^ 3 . Noel, in order to get quick dividends for the attraction of capital, is considering a subsidiary scheme requiring an additional two haif and a half million rials of capital for the resuscitation of the shughtar electricity supply and the provision of piped water, (11) Professor Winsor, the American irrigation expert, hag also inspected the Behbahan Irrigation project, which is intended to provide drinking water for the town of Behbahan and irrigation for a considerable area of land. The project has been semi- moribund for the last two years as a result of the failure of the authorities to provide money or material and 'overhead expenses' have consequently consumed some 60% of the meagre funds available* Professor V/insor, however, finds the scheme full of promise and is convinced that by taking advantage of natural drainage and generally improving on 'an office design of straight lines' he can finish the scheme in six months at a relatively low costc (12) Interesting information on the profits made by the proprietors of agricultural estate has come to light through the efforts of Amir Hussain Bakhtiari, proprietor of the estate of ^halgahi near Bizful, to persuade the lessee, Aghai Qutb, to increase his payments under the lease. Qutb has apparently been in possession of the estate for over twenty years- on a series of five yearly leases* -Last year Amir Hussain requested the lessee, in view of the high prices of agricultural produce, to increase the annual rent of Rials 400,000. Qutb paid him all the rent for the unexpired portion of the lease in advance without deduction for interest as well as an ex gratia payment of Rials 600,000 to avoid future appeals to his generosity. Qutb himself estimates a net profit on the lease for the current year of well over a million rials, so the Bakhtiari’s importunities are natural enough. Qutb, on tire other hand, is popularly believed to have paid the proprietor honestly and regularly during the twenty years when the Bakhtiari landlords were forbidden to visit Bizful, IV. KconomiC o (13) Almost two inches of rain were recorded in the foothills in an hour and a half on 5th November. In other parts of the district the rainfall was lighter but sufficient to allow ploughing to begin everywhere except in the south-west. In the Jerrahi area already almost as much land has been ploughed as last year, and nearer Ahwaz the progress, though slower, is still good. No active step&amp; have yet been taken for the distribution of seed wheat and it seems unlikely after last year's bumper crop that any large scale distribution will be necessary. In Khalafabad— the centre of the Jerrahi estate— on the contrary, where the sowings are almost completed, deliveries of wheat under the sugar barter scheme have reached a new high level.. (14) The rains have, of course, intensified problems of storage and transport. The British military lorries that were to have brought in 400 tons of wheat from Waig were unable to complete the work as a result of roads closed by rain until 14th November and a portion of the wheat has been ruined. The Waig wheat has, however, filled up the last of the space in the silo not occupied by the allied forces and the safe storage of the extra one thousand tons of wheat required to ensure the food supply of the towns of Khuzistan until the next harvest will be the next nroblem. (15) Optimism induced by the early rains has caused a fall /in the’•* 3 - in the price of wheat which ha.? manifested itself chiefly in increased deliveries under the sugar 'barter scheme. In Dizful, however, which i® reported to have a daily consumption of ten tons of grain, the bakers are now drawing only four tons daily from the government ambars. They can apparently buy wheat in the open market so cheaply that they can'sell pure wheat bread at 5 rials a kilo; ’'government bread”, which in Dizful is believed to contain a trifle over 30/£ barley, is sold at four rials a kilo. 'cr w ^ (16) Orders for the dissolution of the Khuzistan Tobacco /* 66r &gt; 3 , an( ^ Cigarette Monopoly have not yet arrived, but Mr. Solomon appears to have gained a notable success in securing the abolition of the provincial road transport monopoly. This company is alleged to have cornered the black market in tyres and was thus able to force the few independent private lorry owners to conform to its edicts. The size of their profits can be guagdd from the fact that a single payment entry in their books unaccounted for but presumably covering a bribe to some official — amounted to Rails, 1,600,000, V. Baibal—Bakhtiari ' (17) _ The Persian authorities’ plans for the disarmament of the Janeki and Bahmai country show little development as a result of Colonel Humayuni’s visit to Isfahan except in the order in which the minor tribes are to be dealt with. One column of two thousand men is to start from Isfahan for Izeh while a second column of six hundred men is to go into the^ Janeki country from Ram Hormuz, A third column 'consisting of 350 tufangchis under iviohd. All Khan Khalili is to start against the Janeki from Mumbi. After the hypothetical disarmament of the Janeki, the Bahrnai hostiles and afterwards the Teibi are to be disarmed. VI. Tribal--Kuhgiln. (18) _ The fortnight has produced no incidents of note, but uncertainty about the Persian government’s intentions with, regard to Abdullah Khan Zarghampur has produced despondency • among the local supporters of law and order (extending even to Rais-ut-Tujjar)who no longer know whether they should support the anti-Zarghampur bloc or 'lay off” part of'their risks by entering into communication with Zarghampur. Zarghampur himself, who is now reported to be at Pilli, has taken advantage of a clash between the Zila’ee subsection of the Boir Ahmeds and some Bakhtiaris under Jehanshah Ramsami, to protest his devotion to the forces of law and order and denounce the consistent double-dealing of_the Bakhtiari khans. He has also added to the general apprehension in Behbahan and the Boir Ahmed Oarmsir by announcing that the ^arhad ”il” would winter at Alamdar—a position which should have been occupied by the Persian forces some weeks ago had they seriously intended to attempt any control of Boir Ahmed °arhaddi during the winter. (19) ^ In the Boir Ahmed Garmsir the negotiations for a reconciliation between Zarghampur and his renegade brothers supporting Muzaffar Ariani appear to have made no progress* Ali ano Vali Izadpanah with their protegee Nasser, not having decided on which side of the fence they will come down, are apparently being courted by Zarghampur and his opponents and enjoying their unusual popularity. varie ^ of u nconfirmed reports states that the Boir Anraed Sarhad party which left for ^emirurn at the end of October ostensibly for raiding has returned bringing with them two German? /whomwhom thR Qa^hqai felt thempelve® unable to surrender but ready to expel. The Germane are now reported to be under_the_prouec tion of Mullah Vali Panahi of the Qaid Givi pubpection m the neighbourhood of Gach ^aran. (21) The Teibi negotiationp have again met a eer-Dack.

(25) The fate of the Dasht-i-Mishan constituency remains obscure, as the Persian authorities evidently regard it pocket borough designed for accommodating candidates defeated or having gracefully retired elsewhere; Lr. Radji (mease tne Khorrarnshahr elections are not re-arranged to his diking), Aghax Nasseri, who got one vote in the Ahwaz constituency, and Lr. Parhoudi, who appears to have no qualiiications at ill fa_ renresenting the Beni Turuf except the support of various Ministers, are all reported to be jockeying for tha seat, ^.he unfortunate Arabs,in the meantime, having no suitable canuica.e of their own, seem likely to boycott the elections. the Governor-General reports that he has received order* to postpone the elections there until further notice, IX. R ussian Interests, (26) The Consul of the U» e R e held a reception on /November Y tilNovember in celebration of the Anniversary of the Revolution, The reception was attended by senior Persian officials and leading merchants, H.M 0 Consul-General and Vice-Consul, and representatives of the British Forces, (27) The Russian Consul has been trying for the last twelve nt^ths to obtain from the Persian authorities a list of foreigners resident in Khuzistan, The Chief of Police, who was the first to be approached, very properly referred the request to the Governor-General who some months later referred the request to Tehran. The Director of the Municipality has now been approached with the same request. The objection of the request is not known an’d the Municipality is certainly unlikely to possess any such information relating to foreigners outside Ahwaz town. (28) The Russians are displaying the same interest in educa tion in Ahwaz as they showed at eusangird in September, (see para 38 of the diary for the second half of September.) The Director Diof Education has received a written questionnaire about the number of pupils, education standards, the languages taught, the pay of teachers and the supply of text-books. (29) A joint ^oviet-American celebration of the despatch of the sixty thousand lease-lend truck to Russia was held at Andimeshk on the night of 5th November and was followed on the morning of 6 th November by a parade of troops* The Russian Consul, representatives of the Persian government, the British m . 1itcry' ! authorities and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. were invited but no ; member of this Consulate-General. sgd.

III. XCON QHIC. ^G), Grain collections now total over 21,000 tens. A small quantity of wheat is «till being purchased from the Janeki area* but it is unlikely that any further considerable f quantity will be collected. There has been a severe drought j in the centre and south of ;r .huzi-tan which will effect grain I collections this year, and it is estimated that not more than j 7Q00 tons will be the Government’s share. Difficulty i? anticipated since Tehran wish to settle the price at C‘0C j tome,ns a ton, that is to say 100 tomans less than last years figure. Neither do they v/ish the barter system to be employed. L There\ is a possibility that if the Iraq price is consiierably ' ’'^iTIThre^^Xhan -300, 350 may be paid in Xhuzistan. It is thought that collections and the surplus of last harvest colie;tions will be sufficient to feed Ahwaz for the year. Black market price of wheat has risen about 5 r b Bazaar prices remain steady. f. &lt;o b), The Persian year which has just ended ha o seen great changes in the finance Departments working in Xhuzistan. Che outstanding achievement is Mr,°olomon’s success in the collection of grain. He has re-organised the Department so that the ehahristans report to him, whereas before they re ported direct to Tehran, r Niis entailed lack of supervision in the Province. He has started work in unravelling the chaos cf the land revenue department, and has succeeded in getting the accounts up to date. These were three years in arrears and, of course, valuless, He has started a system of village records. If he receives authority to settle land disputes locally from his records the people will possibly th.nk it worth while to develop their holdings, up to now th&gt; highest bidder could get some sg^t of document which had no legal holding stating that he was the owner of an area of land. i \ m » IY.

Colonel Noel was able to return to Ahwaz on 24th April. The ..cting Consul-General and Lt:Ool. Wood the same day visited ^hushtar, and saw the Chief cf Police. It appears that in the country south of ^hushtar there are two bands, together totaling some 150 Arabs, who are terrorising the countryside, inspired by the obvious fact that with the Gendarmerie in its present state, banditry pays handsomely* They are extorting money from the village- and burning crops’ if money is not forthcoming. A detachment of the Persian army is being stationed in n hushtar, and another has be-ui sent up to that area. In the meantime the sheikhs in the district are being told to recover the stolen property- it is said that most of the property will be returned ir. a day or two. In the meanwhile several of the Arab sheikhs have called at the Consulate to express their regret at the incident (probably ir. part as insurance against having my blame attached to them). (50). The Governor-General and Brigadier Hurna^mni have used this incident to take up (ihee again the question of large scale disarmament of the Arab tribes* They are, however, unwilling to undertake it unless they have assurance or official British approval. C’he Acting Consul-General las taken the attitude that as a matter of internal security, not affecting either the AIOC or the Hailway, it is the respon sibility of the Persian authorities and no concern of the British* It is clearly desirable that in the event of things going wrong* (and in the opinion cf the Acting Consul-General, one probabilities are they would go wrong), the Persians should not be able to shift the responsibility on to us, as they clearly hope to do. (51) . A raid was made on the village of Haft Tappeh by marauding Arabs (there is no evidence to show whether they came from the same band as attacked Colonel Noel cr not)* The Indian guards at the AIOC pumping station ex changed shots with the raiders; but there is no reason to supmse that the latter had evil designs on Oil Company property.

The Bakhshdar of Ali Gudarz givee the following figures of rifles collected during the recent disarmament :~ 155 from the xvlogui (©f which 29 are Government rifles issued to Khwajeh Mehdi Quli) 2®0 from the Boshaq, Isavand and Heevidio The majority came from the Boshaq and only 3§ - 40 were collected from the Heevidi #f which 29 came from the village of Chiga Gurg. 47 from the Zalgaqi. None have 'been taken from the turbulent Hajivand or only a few r from the nomad Heevidio Most of the rifles were collected from re latively peaceful villages and included s®me Government rifles issued for protection. The nomads, and especially these among them neted fer marauding were for the most part left untouched. The transfers foreshadowed in the last*diary have taken place; Major Ali Khan has been entrusted with the .task of dealing with raids by Hassanvand Lurs in the neigh bourhood of Nahavand. After this he is to go to Tehran. Before leaving Ali Gudarz he visited Chiga Gurg, on the edge of the Heevidi country with 400 tro®pso Although the Heeyidi sub tribe responsible for the murder of H.M.Vice-Consul, Isfahan, and his companions two years ago wap encamped within three miles of Chiga Gurg, and although their retreat to the hills could easily have been cut off by a few cavalry using a path across the mountains which H.M.Consul-General.recently travelled nothing of the kind was attempted. Rumours were put out that a British Colonel was shortly arriving in the •area with British troops to disarm the tribes and arrest the murderers of H.M.Vice-Consul. It was also put about aming the tribes that Major Ali Khan’s successor. Captain n ohrab Khan, would treat them much worse and have more troops to do it with. The Hajivand and Heevidi were consequently in an excited frame of mind and H.M.Consul-General f s proposed journey to Dorud through their territory from Chiga Gurg had to be abandoned. During a visit to the Zallaqi country a pair of binoculars belonging to our murdered Vice-Consul was recovered. Pressure has been put on the local authorities to take some action to arrest the murderers and Colonel Garzan, the newly-appointed G.O.C. Isfahan is said to be consulting measures with Colonel Assad (^ardar Bahadur.) (2) &lt;. Trouble broke out in the Mogui country or. th-e 18th, when Amir Bahrnan, son of Morteza Quli Khan, accompanied by a number of armed natives surrounded Khwajeh Mehdi Quli by night in his village of Ab Barik. Only the presence of a British officer presented his being led away captive. As it was, Amir Bahxnan gave Khawajeh Mehdi Quli a week in which to make his submission to Morteza Quli Khan at Deh Kurd. On withdrawing Arnir Bahrnan arrested several Mogui headmen. This incident has considerably perturbed Captain Bohrab Khan, the local security officer, who has sent fifty cavalry to Ab Barik and telegraphed Tehran for instructions.' Bohrab informed H.M.Consul-General that he had been told by the Persian General ^taff that the Chahar Lang Mamivand were not under MortezaQuli Khan but under Ali Gudarz and Burujird* He further said that this decision had been communicated to Morteza Quli Khan who had reft ~d to accent it. In view the traditional hostility between the Haft Lang and Ghahar Lang and suspicions entertained by the latter of Morteza Q-ili Khan’s intentions it seems thruri things might be more peace ful if they were removed from nis authority'-' providing /alwaystheir beasts by cash, rather than have further dealings with the Persian military. 9uch raids bear out the contention made by everyone in the area, that if disarmament i s to take place it must be general, since otherwise a portion of the population is rendered defenceless and at the mercy of the rest. The disarmament of the Beni Turuf which i s expected imminently, is therefore welcome. Five of the most powerful sheikhs of the Beni Turuf are on the peint of leaving for' Tehran to discuss the problem of the land settlement (see bel»w para 8; and there is a reasonable chance that if they are detained in Tehran during the operations, the disarmament may take place without bloodshed. This may ,of course not be' according t# the Persian Army T s programme, for wh®m such an operation is effective propaganda, so l»ng as it is not too tame.

The distribution monopoly g, 2 ods in the Rixth Ustan has now reached such proportions (1,065,000 persons were receiving sugar and tea rations at the end of Mordad)^ that the black market for these commodities has been '^i^tualxy broken, in Ahwaz the price of sugar, which a couple of months ago was Rls.12#, is now Rl&lt;=! O 60, and in Behbehan the black market price has fallen below the Government price. The losses which must have befallen the h®arding merchants are most gratifying, similar falls have taken place in the prices of tea and cloth. . ( G- • In Basht-i-Mishnn area, it was discovered that distribution was not being carried out quite as smoothly it was thought. False names and sijjil'numbers were being used to extract from Ahwaz more tea and sugar than was re quired. It seems probable that both the Rheikhs and the Commission in charge (composed principally of the hi ea( a s 0 f pr Ae Persian Government Departments) were in collusion. Mr.Solomon sol^ad this by distributing each villager's share ho re— the vi:Lla g e whL 0 brought in the sijjils. The big sheikha (as opposed to the 'little' sheikhs, wh# form a rival faction, and are therefore anxious to win Government approval) refused to co-operate in arranging far this method of distribution, but were eventually obliged to by their peasants, who saw others profiting. The new Bakhshdar, Hassan Turteati, also showed a marked lack of co-operation, and is believed to have extracted his profit from the latest cloth distribution. Falsafi (see para IS belor) was Bent- out by the Justice Department to investigate, but having * seen the Bakhshdar, returned within a few hours.

Five years ago the price of wheat in Burujird was forty tomans per t@n; it is now three hundred. The rise in the index figure for the cost c-f J.iving has corresponded fairly closely to this in crease; the rise in salaries has not* for instance, the manager of the cotton ginning plant at Burujird gets only two hundred tomans a month extra as an allowance for the increased cost of living, bringing up his salary to 450 tomans per month. Five years ago he used to get 100 tomans a month so that the rise in his emoluments has not kept pace with the rise in prices. He is, however, well off compared with such people as Bakhshdars on 100 - 120 tomans* When a pair of Ideally made shoes costs eighty tomans and a pair of officer’s field boots is more than a month’ p pay of an army ox- gendarmerie subaltern, it is no wonder that universal, corruption prevents any improvement in the administration* Nearly all Persians are corrupt by nature and the present economic pressure magnifies this natural propensity to really staggering pro portions. If the Persian Government would give its civil and military officers ration issues of the necessities of life at reasonable prices, I believe matters might possibly improve. At present they get more favourable treatment as regards the issue of cloth, sugar and tea, but this is not really sneagh* •such a measure would not be likely to send up prices still more, as a mere increase in salaries would probably do.

Mansur Basht Bavi has apparently kept out of it, to the great disgust of Moz&amp;ffar Ariani, who himself is not believed to have taken part in any fighting around Pilli, but v;ho is accused of being one of those responsible for the death in an ambush of Fathullah, brother of Qaid Fassir Bahador Tamoradi, This has resulted, it is said, in the transference &gt;y l/xid Fagsir of his allegiance, with a considerable force', to Abdullah. Nona of the above, however, has a reliability above B/C, at the most. If anything should corns of the suggestion, reported by H,M. Consul, Shiraz, that Abdullah would be prepared to go elsewhere (but not Tehran, Ispahan, or any other big centre) such a move would be welcomed by everybody, not the least this office. (26) c Arabs* The five sheikhs of the Peri T urud mentioned in para 8 of Diary Fo. 13 went early in the month to .Tehran, where they are receiving the active support of Par Jr 2 d i, the deputy of that area. They are still there and are bb t expected to return for bhe time being. (27), Humayuni ha^ started on his disarmament cf this tribe. He. has two battalions of infantry, 3#0 'cavalry, some artillery and 10 aircraft. He distributed by air a notice dated 23rd October, in Arabic (n©t very go®d Arabic), demanding the surrender of all rifles (text given a? Appendix to this diary). He called in all the sheikhs cf the area, who came and professed obedience to the Persian Govern ment, with the single exception of sheikh Yunus As si of the Bait ^harhan who will probably fall into line when be sees that his defiant attitude has no support. The last figure given of rifles so far collected has been 35§, a figure a long way short of that which is likely to satisfy Humayuni. (28), Three of the four forms of Government assistance promised to the Arabs by Humayuni are already being effected by- the Finance Department. The fourth is education. The Governor-General, on being questioned as to what it was intended should be done in this line, said that there was always the difficulty of financing anything, but 'he had spoken to the Ministry of Education in Tehran* 1 , who had promised to do l V?iat they could n . This is very un promising. If the Central Government would realise the value of creating primary schools in the Arab areas, in which instruction in Arabic was given, and Persian taught, to that Arabs could then attend higher Persian soh®ois, and even Persian universities, they could not only make a gesture which would contribute towards satisfying the Arabs at the present time, but w®uld lay a foundation for the solution of this particular minority problem.

The Boir Ahmed situation during the month has been virtually as it was described in Diary 16. Both iiarghampurs are ill; and there are plenty of rumours that negociations are in progress v to settle matters peaceably. 'I’his stat« of affairs, which was foraeen by the a.L.O. Ahwaz some months ago, when he doubted the steadfastness of purpose of the leaders in the 'anti AKZ bloc', might also have been anticipated by Humayuni, whc basin reality achieved nothing but harm. His 'secret' interference into tribal intrigues has resulted in the probably permanent alienation of Abdullah Khan iarghampur, who can ntw net be expected t« have any trust in, or to co-operate with, the Central Government; and these underhand methods have aroused suspicion in dther tribes also. (23) . Arabs. The month has been taken up with the operations in the Dasht-i-Mishan. Rains in the middle of the month hampered movements considerably, but the fine spell which followed has let the ground dry up, and Humayuni’s aero planes are now once more in action. The tendency for Arabs t« cross the frontier into Iraq, mentioned in Diary 15, con tinued, to the extent that Humayuni became seriously worried, and after vain attempts to get into touch with the Iraq frontier authorities and with D.A.P.A. Amara, returned to Ahwaz on 23rd and tried t«. persuade the A.L.O. and the Consulate to solve his problems. It was pointed out to him that this was a matter for the Persians and Iraqis to settle between them, and no concern of the British, whereupon he invoked British interest in the security of the area, which he said was thereby threatened. H,H* Embassy in Tehran, on being consulted, confirmed that no action on the part Of the British authorities was called for. °he Persians have continued to attempt to involve us, pestering the iwL.J. to fly over the area and sending in a request for the return of other tribes; avoiding action has been taken.

The probable effect of disamanent wou^d be that ma-uy Arabs would then return to Persia.

The first two conditions appear to offer no difficulty; everybody’s efforts are nov/ directed to gett ing Abdullah to come to Behbehan. There is no doubt that the Khansj, mindful of the events of the reign of Nesa Bhal; genuinely distrust the word of the Persian Government and are prepared for any kind of treachery; and this distr&amp;oc in Abdullah’s mind has not been dissipated by Humayuni f s re cent policy in the Kuh Galu* It does however now seem that Humayuni, (certainly confident that he can arouse the intertribal disputes to fresh fury at will, should occasion demand) is sincere in his efforts to reach a settlement and most people are optimistic over the chances of Abdullch. coming in« It is emphasised by all concerned that everyone wishes peace and is tired ®f perpetual disputes* At the moment the next move is awaited from Abdullah* (21) C^ashqai^ Nasir Khan Qaehqai is still at Mishun, in spite of General Firuz’s summons to him to return to bhir^z# He was seen there 18th~19th December by the Acting Consul General and the A*L„0. v/hen he complained that he was being let down by both Persians and British, and that for him tc hurry hither and yon at Piruz’s behest v/ithout him achiev ing the aims for v/hich he had come would destroy his prestige# The settlement of the Boir Ahmed dispute was he considered his principle aim, since he felt himself bound by the covenant taken at Qumeisheh to support Abdullah Khan* He clearly feared an imminent attack on Abdullah; if #ne did not come, it would be on account of his presence in the area.

Arabs, as stated in Diary 17, the operations in the Beni Turuf are now completed, and the second phase, that of /disarming * I4 JG-/KiI dianrming the Araht along both banko «f the K.run have begun* It now beems probable that the chief reason for ®po©aition to Humayunt from Yunia bin Aai was that the former intended restoring the lands of the latter t« three outside sheikha who have under another regime enjoyed them and who came in by force with the Persian array. Apart fr©m the moral that the Persian army * -when indulging in operations of this oort should like Pharoah* l&gt; wife be ab#ve suspicion, and should r®t involve itself in pelitical intrigue, this co:U*irms once again that a settlement of the land %uesti@ns in /'bus lot an v/ould be the greatest centributien to peace and quiet in the area that the Persian Government canid make. In contrast to the Mian Ab operations Humayuni has shown great restraint in the Dasht-i-Mishan and while he declares that th®se who opened fire against the government must be punished, no harm has come to any®re else nor will those who fled to Iraq be punished for so d®ing» In the meanwhile, those who did flee are gradually r^turningc Phe present ®perati®ns are going smoothly. To date 600 rifles have been collected. It is learnt that Humayuni, largely inspired by pique at the failure of the Iraqi Government to co-operate in his operations, has got the Ministry @f War and the Ministry of Poreign Affairs to inform the Iraqi Government that the tribes who c$ne over the frontier into the Pasht-i- Mishan area for grasing will n®t be permit-ed to do so this year.

Abadan Island, the British should try and persuade the Arabs to give up their arms, i sgd. J. P. Gethin ACTI10 GOi ulJL GFii BRAL&lt; 40^7 .

There have been complaints in the ci^y against the Municipality, that it spends money on nuntoer- less employees and does nothing for the town. There is con siderable truth in this, although some (if quite inadequate) work has been done in the last few months on the Ahwaz stfects and digging continues on the road to the *_• 1. 0 . C. compound (see para 10 of Ahwaz Diary 17, 1944). The question of this road seems to be being handled in the usual futile menne^; the A.I.O.C. who had offered to resurface the road, has had io write to the Governor-General pointing out that the Municipality appears to be preparing for a 15 metre roadway, whereas the Company’s offer applies to the preaent 30 foot roadway. More over, although the road goey over a slight eminence, the Municipality seems determined, in contrast to the recocnq^tid- ations of the A.I.O.C* surveyor, to drain the whole road ih one direction; and the A.I.O.C. has had to disclaim responsi bility for undertaking any alteration of the road level., (9) . Health. The report of the Health Department St Ahwa* Isoks very fine, nothing being reported for Ahwaz, Ram Horrauz,bhushtar and Dizful during the whole month except 1 death from tyahus and 1 from smallpex in „Jhrraz and a caye of dysentary in Dizful. It doey a© t show, what Captain Parves now reports after visiting ousamgird, that a smallpox epidemic has recently been raging in that area. During four months IOOO people are said to hav 2 died, ihe single semi qualified doctor in the area was sent vaccine, but this was either Infected ©r useless, hecauce most of those who were vaccinated subsequently came out with smallpox, many dying.

Jn S3rd, tHe workers in the Cotton upinning l^attory lejft the j , «.etory at the lunch hour proclaiming they were \Xnited, and went on strike* buhsequex.tly the Workers Union wrote to the Directors, demanding higher wages, shorter hours, better conditions etc. There was no disorder. The Chief of Police, who the following morning harangued the strikers, that they should make n* disturbance and promised to make a report to the Governor-General, Misbah, who repeats at inter vals that he does not know anything,about such matters, as usual formed a Commission* The Directors have agreed to' Reduce the working day from ten to eight hours, and to provide greater medical facilities and baths etc, and the strike ended pn 25th. ^he question of wages is still under consideration, but It is believed that the directors have plucked up suff icient courage to withstand these intimidatory methods, and that no general raise will be given. , (ii). It is quite clear that this strike was enginetred as a trial of strength by the Workers Union. r 'he wages, al though lower than those paid by the A*I»O.C. are not dis gracefully so; and it is worthy of comment that.at a time when labour was scarce in Ahwaz, there was no tendency /or workers to leave the opinning factory in order to find work with the n.I.u.O. Many of the workers hsd no idea why tfcey were striking; and it is highly undesirable that any gr*at success should be achieved on this occasion by the intriguing of the Union for purely political ends. It is stated thlt wnen the Governor-General referred to the A.I.J.C. wages as a standard on which to work, the Union repr sentative (one of the agitators from Tehran, not a Itcal worker) replied t?iat A.I.O.C. wages were quite inadequate and that something gould be done about that in the future. j A I (12). The Union has elected as its •fficers Ashofct-ii ;as President and Ali Ornid as Vice President. A Tudeh Part? ^committee is also understood to have been formed, the leading light of which is Attarzadeh, wh# had been released frtm prison (see para 18 of Diary 14, 1944) a few days befoe the strike. All these three are agitators sent down from the North. The Tudeh Party are reported to have invited Dr.Ahmed Alevi ( para 9 of Diary 15) to become an Honorary Member, which in-- v vitation he has refused. (15). B urujird . Reffironce para 1 of Diary 1, it is leamt f that the' Governor of Burujird has gtcwn weary of Falahetis activities, and after incojneluaive reference to the Governor- General, decided to put him into jail. He was probably •tirred to this by the arrival of three Tudeh workers from Tehran, (14) , becurity. Eight spans of copper wire were stolar. from the A.1.0.0. telephone line within the Gach oaran area, the thieves being either Bavi or Darashuri. (15) . \ A general increase in raiding is reported ifi the Dasht-i-Miahan area, following on the disarmament. ?h*e raiding is put down chiefly to tribes frem Iraq. X C 0 N 0 M I C. (16) . Prices tended to rise early in the month, in anti cipation of the removal of Dr.Millapaugh’s economic powers; and when the law was, finally passed, it had no additional effect. Instead it was offset by the war news, and by the end of the month, prices were lower than at the beginning. The /movement- 3 - movement of gold was reversed during the month, v*h&lt;?n the Iraqi price fell below the Persian price and gold began to return to this country. (17), The instructions signed by Dr^lUllspaugh, the Prime tfinister and the Minister of Finance, to the Director- General of Finance to hand over the work of the various economic sections to the officials at present in charge of those departments, both in Ahwaz and in the 16 district centres, was an act of sheer lunacy. In Ahwaz, before the law of Ordibehesht (though not in other parts of Persia) the Director of Finance wao also in charge of the Department of Kharbar, and the work cf the two departments have always been geared together. In many of the district centres, the reproaentatlva of the Finance Department has also done all the work regard ing, for instance, rationed commodities distribution, and the only roan he can hand over the responsibility to is the store keeper. In Ahwaz, Mr.solomon’s chiefs of departments wore well chosen men, but not accustomed to exercising responaibilltjri after ten days of it, at least one is begging to be allowed tq resign. The Distribution Department has no sugar to dis tribute (ur.oclomon had intended to borrow it from the Custom*); and money (which is due to come from Tehran) to pay the employees, Mr.bolomon was able to give brond interpretation* to regulations which his unhappy successors cannot do, and on* department could be co-ordinated to assist another# Ther* 1 * a story that Brigadier Ifumayuni’s oomnent on hearing of Tehran 1 * aecision was ^There go my tribes ! 11 and indeed it will be * matter ef surprise to this office.if commodity good* r&amp;*oh the tribal areas at all in the future# A considerable in crease in raiding will result# (i«).

Miscellaneous (22) The British Military in Ahwaz held a Red Cross Week from 3rd to 11th. Persians contributed handsomely in giving prizes for a big lottery, and putting their offering in the collection boxes. The high spot was a race meeting for British,American and Persian officers a^.d men, with one race for Arab and Uagwand tribesmen. There were thirty five entries for this last, prizes of sugar axid tea being given. The meeting, which was very well attended by most Persian officials, the staff of-the Russian Consulate and large numbers of the populace, in addition to British,American and Persian soldiery, was an enormous success, and enjoyed by everyone present. (23) A number of Ahwaz merchants have combined to form a charitable fund. This committee calls itself the Anjoman-i- Khairiyeh Ja’fariyeh Ahwaz. They have agreed to subscribe one million rials in monthly installraents over 20 months* It seems probable that this is part of a counter offensive against the Workers Union. (24) Mr. Israel H'Oaeh appeared in this district this month, to show his film on Jews in Palestine. He gave one performance at a local cinema, for which he had also been lent three newsreels by this Consulate; it is understood that some 360 people attended it, over 90% being Jews, One or two Persian officials and four members of the Russian Consul^ te attended: two or three other Persian officials went, but finding no seatq reserved for them came away again. ^he Cinema in question is permanently out of bounds to British troops.

He would need 20 days to assemble this force. He taeijs that a Persian Array force of at least 2000 or an absolute minimum of 1500 is necessary.

(28) Deference para 25 of Diary 2, the Bani Turuf sheikhs are not now so happy about their achievements in Tehran, having rather surprisingly been taken in by Persian promises. They say that the Governor-General and Humayuni are not proving helpful, and state that these officials are still trying to restore to the Dasht-i-Mishan, the three bheikhs mentioned in para 25 of Diary Do.18, 1944. Although it is still considered b^ this office that the Bani Turuf sheikhs should not get the lands which should become the property of the peasants'cultiva ting them, these bheikhs at least have a far greater claim than the three pretendants.

On their* return to Ahwaz, Humayuni informed Teheran that he did not consider the proposed operations feasible. It would appear that in his desire to dissuade the General Staff from their plans with an argument ~ iicel y to appeal to the i, he must have overstressec the undesirability of arming the BaKhtiari, to the exclusion of the other reasons for not undertaxing these operations, Since they are now pressing Humayuni to disarm the lahmai without the use of a BaKhtiari force. They have summoned aim to Teheran; but whereas m the middle of the menth he was himself proposing suen a visit, he is now believed lo be reluctant to go .'30) While at Bar basht he is understood to have mentioned’ to the ABC at he had an idea of disarming the Hajiwand, to be put up as alternative operations (presumably on the fundamental Persian principle that the army must be constantly justifying its existence).

He has also, it is betievec, come to terms with his half brother Khosrow; but it is impossible to say ho / long it will be before that extremely unreliable young man again makes trouble. During the last month of 1944 Brigadier Humayan: had been following the policy of frightening Abdulina Khan to terms by givin^ open support to his enemies anong tne other Kuh Galu Khans (including Knosrow;. This may have had some effect on Abdul * 1 ah, in addition to the more conciliatory policy of General Piruz from Shiraz, whxch was r* o later followed by Humayuai. But its weakness were iaosn apparent, botxi in ths grounds which it ^a* r e no tribemen generally to sispect the Government netnods ('divide et impera' has nsver been a policy designed to inspire confidence? which is what is needed in Persia), and in the unreliability of the Khans which -ne Government were supporting. Moreover, these latter were liable to consider tne Government under an obi igation to then to a degree where tney were bcvir. &lt; -o be disappointed, (tney now resent the imx^roved relationship between the Government and Abdullah Knan). This policy is reflected m the assurance that has now been given to these khans of Government support xu case of encroachment on “lieir independence by Abdullah Khan - an assurance which may well encourage the more irresponsible among then, such as Khosrow and Kalek Mansur Basht 3avi,to stir up agitation in opposition to Abdullah Khan when i' suits their booK. It may be assuined tnat with tnis year’s good harvest, tne economic condition of the tribes, and tuerefore tne security cf tne area, wiV 1 be satisfactory; but if or when tne economic condition deteriorate, and particularly if tne rationed goods, tea, sugar and cloth, cease to be available to the lawless Kuh Ga!u wilT return tribes, the problem of the to its former proportions. 5 * 0 !’’owing on the Hiauab operations cf last June/ 3» TV JLJ J l m T.

Governor of Tehhan ) had been packed oil go Tehran. The Governor of Burujird volunteered the opinion that Burnlira had done pretty well out of the war, and uhis may well be true, though there are numbers o*'* very poor people and the town is extremely dirty. The Airs are certainly armed to some extent, in fact they ha^e n-ver realiy been disarmed. One of them told me that he thought 100,000 Lurs must have left the province in one way or anether during Reza Shah’s stern rule, but some of them have come back. Political activity was not prominent. The brother of Seyyid Zia is at Burujird, but the most active oropagandist for the 1 Iradeh-i-Milli” party seemed to be an ex-Colonel of Gendarmerie, Reza Quii Arghun, once known as ’’Numreh Yek ' 1 because he passed ail his examinations in the ton place.

A military court, convened, by the brigade comniander at Susangird for the trial of the captured Sheikhs, met to wards the end of the month under the presidency of Oclo Shahrukhio The other members of the court, four in number, were (like the president) officers who had served in the dis trict and were therefore hardly likely to be neutral: in cidentally they had all been recommended for decorations in connexion with the capture of the Sheikhs, though it is well known that not a single man of the Persian regular troops came into action at all. The proceedings of the court were very rapid and two Sheikhs, Lufteh Thamir and Hamdan Xazim, were sentenced to death; four were acquitted and the rest given varying terms of imprisonment. However, the inspector sent down from the Ministry of War, Gol.Ala’i, considers that the trial was irregular and that its findings ought to be quashed. Five thousand tomans has been received for distri bution among the relatives of the Arabs who fell or were wounded fighting on the side of the Persian Government: the number of casualties of this kind was 43: 37 are reported to have been kid led on the attacking side. (17). The Tehran commission charged with the examination of the whole question of the Dasht-i-Mishan lands and with making recommendation about future policy, has made its report. It consisted of representatives of the Ministries of the In terior, Justice, War, and Finance, the last being I&amp;r*.Solomon: and the majlis deputy Hussein Farhudi, who has been showing a praiseworthy and (considering the weather) surprising interest- in the affairs of his constituency. The result of their deliberations has been the adoption of Mr.Solomon*s plan of allotting all the land afresh, cn- a communal village basis, the heads of families being named collectively in the title- deeds. This would greatly shorten the task of registration and enable the villagers themselves to subdivide the land annually in accordance with the exigencies of the moment; the land, in fact, would be held in undivided shares known by the term 'rausha Certain taxes which used to be collected by the Sheikh are to be abolished, the only tax remaining being the smaller one payable to the ^mubashir 1 ' or kedkhuda. The Sheikhs, if friendly, will get up to 20 shares of land, but will have no privilages. It remains to be seen whether this arrangement will work: the peasants ought to welcome it, but of course the Sheikhs will not, and it will need strong and impartial handling, with frequent inspections. MOBILE DISPENSARY. (18). Captain Parvis has submitted an interesting report- on his tours on horseback and by car in the Euhgilu. area between May 18th and July 7th, Interesting points about this wild and little-known area are: the backward and primitive character of these mountain tribes,'some of whom still fight with knives: their isolation from modern life: their arduous struggle for existence which in very truth leads to a survival of the fittest: their indifference to the sufferings of others, in cluding their own people: their tribal organisation and feuds: their freedom from, but dread of, vene*el disease: their res pect for Beyyids, and their reverence for the Shah. Captain Parvis inclines to the opinion that the quarrelsome and indeed murderous proclivities of these tribes are largely attributable to their habit of living bn little besides bread mads from /acorn flour,i 9 I’ll 9 OONdUI- GENI5HA] acorn flour, which is so indigestible that it in duces a permanent state cf constipation.

(4) , The Governor-General, having succeeded in tak ing over ffom the Americans the luxurious and enormously costly Banque-i-Millie building, has established his offices there* He has had to deal with a good many distinguished personages passing through: they included Zand, ex-Minister of War, returning from Palestine apparently restored in health: Iraj Eskandary Majlis deputy, on his way to Khorram- shahr: Mrs, Djem, wife of the Ambassador to Egypt: Mohsan badr, recently Prime Minister, on his way to the holy places of Iraq: Ahmad Ghadimy, exacting-head of the Protocol division of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, on his way to take up the post of Consul Quetta: and Messrs* Namazi and Moaddel of bhiraz, en their way to take over at Khorramshahr . the large amount of material they have bought from the Americans, BAKHTIARI. (5) , Early in the month reports were received of meetings of ’’kalantars” or sub-chiefs of the tribes residing near Masjid-i-Suleiman, near Zila’i and Lali. The kalantars of the Zarrasfand, the Baba Ahmedi (particularly Iskandar Khan), the Bbtidarvand, the Alasvand, and the tJsivand declared they were against Morteza Quli Khan as Governor, while the Gandali and the Meosi were neutral and some of the Khediri and the Khidir-Burkh were for him 6 On the 14th December Amir Bahman then at Qaleh Z^rras in Andika sent a request tc the commanding officer of the Khuzistan Division for ammunition with which to defeat Abul-Qasim, then reported near Ardal with 70 supporters. It was hardly to possible, even if it had been advisable, to accede to this request. The next news was that the c®mmand®s of the two young hot-heads had had a fight near a place called Galawati in the Andika area, with casualties on both sides. It was eventually discovered that three persons had been killed: a Gendarmerie officer named Nasir Azad who was counted as one of Amir Bahman’s men though he was not supposed Ij be in the fight at all: and on Abul-Qasim’s side badegh Bavarsad and a servant of Haji Murad Khan* Tohanshah, .amir Bahman’a half-brother, rushed to the f ^ m tat.hor* side of the tribal area and succeeded in REtto.

He then came down to Ahwaz a*d saw the Consul-General, together with a e©mpanioi4 named Abdur- Reza Bakhtiar, cousin of Ahul-Qasim, and therefore a member of the Ha.ji Ilkhani family. They sought to obtain our agree ment t@ a plan for the future government of the tribe whieh Wfuld in effect make Jehanshah governor of the tribe, re presenting the Ilkhanis, and Abdur-Reza his assistant, re presenting the rival Haji Ilkhanis. They then went back hoping to persuade both Morteza iuli Khan and Amir Bahman to agree to this proposal: they were accompanied by Col. A;fshar-oghl©u commanding the Khuzistan division, wh$ seerrvs to have a good deal of influence with the Bakhtiaris, ani to have been instrumental in getting an agreement drawn Up on the lines mentioned and submitted formally to Tehran for approval. It is to be hoped that some such agreement will be accepted, though as long as the impetuous and crazy Abul- Qasim isin the tribal country it is unlikely that quiet will prevail. Jehanshah and Abdux Reza both seemed to recognise that Morteza Quli Khan was very unpopular with a large pcrtitn Of the tribe: and they acknowledged that the truth #f the matter was that one family, the Ilkhanis, had been getting the pickings for too long, so that it was high time the other family had a share. Col*Afshar-oghlou succeeded in inducing Abul-Qasim to send eloquent telegrams to the Majlis, ihe Prime Minister, and many newspapers expressing their loathing of the foreign intervention in Azerbaijan and de claring their readiness to shed their last drop of blood for jche fatherland. LURISTAN. ( 6 ). The state of Luristan has been quiet: a new police post is being opened at Dorud, and the dumps, mostly American, are being disposed of and taken away as transport is found. The recent rains have caused wash-outs on the main asphalted road from Andimeshk to Khorramabad and Burujird, but no workers have been seen repairing them. (7). The forthcoming elections for provincial councils have given rise to a good deal of speculation and activity. On the 28th Deoember a meeting took place by invitation of a merchant named Abdullah Ateshkadi and attended by about 80 notables and traders. The ©bjects were to establish what ttosy called a non-political party to secure the election of reliable persons on the provincial council who might re present the true interests of tne people of the province, and incidentally to get their own back from certain officials who had been oppressing them. The resulting party teok the name of '’Hizb-i-Sa’adat” and sent a telegram to Tehran. Whatever the intentions of the founders were the existence of such a party has inevitably provoked opposition from rival merchants and political opponents, especially the members of the shadowy ' l Adalat' f party. The Governor-General for a long time v/as without instructions as to how to conduct the elections, but he is understood to have received 50,000 voting papers and instructions as to who should receive them. The final result is to be a High Provincial Council at Ahwaz of twelve elected members, with Provincial Councils in the bigger towns (no doubt Abadan,Khorramshahr,Behbehan,Dizful, dhushtar,Khorramabad, and Burujird) of six members each, each one sending one representative to the High Provincial Council. Misbah-Patemy is not optimistic about the advan tages of having such a body of local advisers: he thinks they will merely form an obstructive and intractable body of wire-pullers and job-seekers, exploiting to the full the Persian genius for disagreement.HAMIDIYSH (3), 3 Colonel Noel has soent the whole mont h-J.n endeavouring to persuade the Government to come to some decision about the lease of the Hamidiyeh and Ahu-Dasht properties whioh he has been managing, ilis efforts have been quite fruitless. INDIAN EXHIBITION. ' 11 ' 11 (9) . Mr. Rahman, from the Government of India, passed through Ahwaz on his way to Tehran and back in order to discuss plans for the exhibition of Indian goods and crafts which is to take place next year.

Mr. Solomon having finally decided not to accept future employment in Persia left this province and Persia on the 19th December, having handed over to his assistant Irfani pending the arrival of Yusuf Sani’i who is to take over both the Finance and the Economics departments very soon. Gani'i was here before ilr. bolomon came, ^he (latter in spite of his youth made a very remarkable name for himself while in charge of the finances of the province and the surprising number of Persians who saw him off was a tri bute to his success and a sign of his reputation, WEATHER &amp; MTTEOROLOGICAL.
