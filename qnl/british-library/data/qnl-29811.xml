This was in itself of too little value to send home but Sir Andrew has now prepared from it and from existing maps the enclosed eketcho You will realise that it is quite conjectural and is merely intended to give a rough idea of how the land may lie and ho?; the tribes may be disposed along the frontier* It/ Eastern Department1 9 Foreign Office*9 It has fceen neoeeeary for one thing to adopt Fuad's data, dog.,, he eh^s the lo^er arm of his s ae running east from the eea but he placed wa’Mn on it, whose Via ' ISn is shown in Sheet 3 of the 1/253440 map very much further north„ The map indeed puts it still further north than the dotted line to the sketch, hut if full account had been taken of this uhe s'^efch would have become quite Impossible, We enclose a portion of another document, which has gained in interest since we contented ourselves with a general account of it in our despatch Ho,186 of June 18 last. This is an extract from the article on 'Asti* in the 'Cmm-al-Qura' of June 9, 1932 , You will observe that the 'Umm-al-Qura' article does not mention the Beni Malik, The explanation almost cervainly is that they and their mountain are Just across the boundary between the TiMma province and \b%v Surat $ the distinction between which the Saudi Government were very keen to emphasise at that time, rue '.den telegram to which you refer is doubtless one which reached us in so corrupt a form on January 31 that we could not decypher the name of the attacking tribe. If it was Benghazi, they are doubtless identical with the Bil Ghazi, who have been mentioned on various occasions, e.g,, in the enclosed extract and the communique enclosed, in our despatch Ho,71 of March 3» 1933, The one thing clear is that all these tribes, who lie on a sort of crescent over against Sa’ada, are exceedingly marginal and have no loyalty to Ibn Baud, rhey im&lt;e probably very little love of the Imam eitherbut they eeem to cling to the Idri e i 0 some or all of them took part In the 1932 rebelllono It *as in the ^ $aifa area that Haean took refuge when it petered out„ skipping from there into definitely Yemeni territory 0 And it is no^' in the same region that # Ahdul WahMb al Idr^ei has joined in or created a fresh revolt, which may he only a Stirling up of the embers of the old* We have been tempted to think that the area now in quest-ton was that claimed by the Im&amp;ra under the name of Hamzdn or Hamden, when the Saudi delegation were at •San'a 0 This would make his claim intelligible* i 0 eo g he would have been asking for the TiMma, the area now in question and the QahtSn country, that of the tribes whose overlord was Ibn Dhulayra; the whole frontier area in fact as far as Ha jran, which he regarded as hie own in any case 0 This has some value as a working theory but we mus l- confess that all attempts to associate the very common name Hamden with the particular area have broken down One more point:- The Minister, when at home, told , Johns tone tha t he thought sir Tih&amp;ma was the approved !

As regards the King’s letter to me, I propose replying as I do on such occasions giving news of my health etc. and local matters of interest etc. 3* As regards the King’s 'Mulhaq* to the Shaikh giving latest Yemen news: This was of sufficient interest to cause His Excellency the Shaikh to pay me a special visit. 4. The latter said that, reading between the lines, as he could do being an Arab, better than I could, he saw that matters in a si r were clearly fast approaching a crisis for the following reasons: (a) The Imam Yahya was clearly out to waste time and give Bin Laud n smooth n words outwardly, but all the tine be was continuing his under ground hostile activities (such as encouraging the Asir tribes to rise and cut communications etc.etc.) (b) Yahyas obvious intention was to pin the Laudi farces to the Asir country until the hot weathei came on, when the King wmild be forced to give way to all his demands or fight at a serious ✓serious disadvantage. (o) Yahya knew that Bin oaud was only keeping his Asir amy supplied with food by superhuman efforts and that money and supplies must fail, if he procrastinated long enough. (d) Bin baud’s army was pressing the King r ^ daily either to attack or abandon Asir for the leaders recognized that inaction was weakening them, and playing into the hands of Yehya. (©) Bin baud saw all this clearly too, but dare not risk a pitched battle* 5* Taking all the above into consideration, His Excellency was of opinion that the crisis was near now, but was still of opinion (expressed at the commencement of the Yemen trouble), that there would no war, and that a settlement would be arrived at. 6# Tli© crux of the situation now lay, said the Shaikh, In the IDJRI3I, Yahya wanted Bln Baud to give the Idrisi a small slice of Asir to reside in under his (Yahya’s) guarantee of good behaviour while Bin Baud wanted (a) either the surrender unconditionally of th© Idrisi or that Yahya should keep him (Idrisi) under surveillance in some town in the interior of Yemen, he (Bin baud) paying him a salary; (b) that Yahya should pay Bin Baud the total cost of maintaining his army In th© field, calculated at approximately 10/-S. a day per man from the day the trouble began. 7. The above conditions were brought to Bis Excellency by K.B.Abdul Latif bin Abdul Jalil, who got them from the King at Risth. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd.

Similar letter sent to dc?THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia) CONFIDENTIAL. [E 1431/79/25] Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received March 5.) (No. 41.) Sir, Jedda, February 13, 1934. SINCE I wrote my despatch N o. 33 o f the 6th February there has been very little to report about the Saudi-Yemen situation, but it may be worth while tc&gt; amplify the contents of my telegram No. 22 of the 12th February. 2. In paragraph 7 of my previous despatch I mentioned that the Amir Feisal had left Mecca in the first days of February, ostensibly on a hunting expedition. I have since heard that he went to a place called Hanakiya or Henakiya, which appears to be the place of that name shown in the maps some 60 to 80 miles north-east of Medina. Its importance lies in the fact that it is one of the permanent camel parks maintained by Ibn Saud as a definite part of his military organisation. The camels are kept in large numbers at small expense in order to have mounts ready for troops in case of need. I am told that there are three such parks in the Hejaz. I have heard of another near Hail, and there are doubtless similar parks elsewhere. The Amir Feisal had not returned to Mecca up to 11th February, when he was, according to the Minister of Finance, at another place not far from Hanakiya. 3. My Indian vice-consul, who returned on the 11th February from a short visit to Mecca, found people there depressed and full of rumours of war. It was suggested that the Amir Feisal might proceed from the Medina area direct to Jizan and that the King himself would leave for the front about the end of this month at the head of forces recruited from the “towns,” who are less likely than the Ikhwan and the tribesmen to be called out on minor occasions,but who would appear to constitute an important element in the army when it is mobilised for large-scale operations. Both the prince and his father were represented as being now engaged in great efforts to inflame the ardour of the tribes and to overcome the reluctance of some, e.g., it was said that portions of the Ajman and Mutayr had been brought to the Hejaz, but that the latter were unwilling to march. The Amir Feisal is said also to have been at great pains earlier to conciliate Ibn Rubaiyan, when the latter was at Taif some little time ago before leading his Ateyba to the south. 4. I need not multiply these reports and rumours. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah’s personal observations and his information from intimate personal friends leave no doubt that warlike preparations of every kind are on foot, including measures to increase the number of recruits, to extract money from non- combatants and to provide transport, &amp;c. It does not follow that even now Ibn Saud wants war, but he is certainly acting as though he expected it, and he can hardly support indefinitely the strain entailed by his present preparations, whether it be the financial strain or the strain involved in keeping in the field large numbers of men, who might fight readily enough for the King, despite all that is said of his unpopularity, but who grow impatient if kept doing nothing. 5. I am aware that this picture is not unlike those that were painted at earlier stages of the quarrel. It is not so much the preparations themselves as their sustained intensity and the consideration that they cannot go on for ever that make me take a rather gloomy viewv What has impressed me most in the last few days has been the emphasis with which the Minister of Finance told me, on the evening of the 11th February, that neither side expected the Abha Conference to succeed. The Minister had come down from Mecca to receive the information which you had authorised me to give him about the promoters of the new bank scheme. He was in a mood to please, but when I asked him for news of the south, he affirmed and reaffirmed that no good could come of the conference. I asked him how things were going in the Jebel Faifa area. He gave no definite further information, but said that it was precisely because of what was happening there that he took the view he did of the prospects of the conference. He laid the blame on the complete untrustworthiness of the Imam. March 5, J934. Section-. r. z 2 . £418 i q 3 4 No. 1.Jlin 1 6.

He stated that as a precautionary measure the Amir Feisal and King'a third son were leaving in two or three days for Tihamat Asir and Riyadh respectively to com and troops in those places. He read ten telegrams exchanged between the King and Imam from Larch 26th to April 1st. Yhe ling has categorically refused to suspend advance unless he gets satisfaction on following points* A The King to retain Badr and aii Ilabuna which are now admitted to be occupied by Ikhvan. Imam to retain waila and all south of it. Intervening area, i.e, Audi Hajran proper, to be neutralised or divided on basis of status quo. B. Imam to withdraw from Beni !ialik-Faifa-Abadil area and to remove Abdul •mhhab Idrisse to place previously agreed upon. The King has rejected Imam 1 s proposal that he should suspend action pending despatch of Abdullah A1 Kazir to Mecca to furnish explanations* He regards this as a mere time saving device 0 His last telegram practically amounts to an ultimatum supported by continuation of military action although lie still describes latter as defensive. According ..„2o According to Yusuf Yasin there has still been no armed conflict* I asked as from myself whether even now it would not be prudent for the King to confine himself to action in territory which he claims as his own. Reply vms non committal but implied that it might be a matter of military necessity to cross the frontier. In the King's speech of March 22nd ? which reached me after last conversation, he reproached other Moslem rulers and bodies for not having attempted to reconcile parties of the dispute and get at the truth. I therefore again, as from myself, reminded Yusuf Yasin that King Feisal had offered to mediate and asked whether possibilities of settlement by mediation nad been fully explored. Yusuf Yasin referred to various appeals to the King after he had ordered advance and said that the King had at no stage either sought or rejected mediation. He intimated pretty clearly that it was now in any case too late.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] From SAUD I-ARABIA 0 Deoypher 0 Do R* Sir Ao Ryan, (Jedda), 3rd April, ll w 50 a 0 m 3rd April, 1934. 11c50 a.mo 3rd April, 1934.

Sir A . fiyan to Sir John Simon.—{Received February 19.) Jedda, February 6, 1934. (No. 33.) Sir, WITH reference to my telegram No. 16 of the 3rd February, I have the honour to forward herewith a careful precis of the telegrams regarding the Saudi-Yemen situation, which Taufiq Bey Hamza came from Mecca to show me on the 2nd February. ( x ) Although I took copies of the telegrams before returning them, I think that you will find them at least as intelligible in this form as if 1 submitted even lengthier literal translations. 2. It is no new thing for Ibn Saud to cause sheaves of telegrams to be brought to the knowledge of the Legation by special emissaries. What is more unusual is that all the present telegrams are carefully dated, and that steps were taken to communicate to me the last and most important of them within forty-eight hours of its despatch. I may add that Taufiq Bey, who has none of his brother Fuad’s experience and little of his assurance, appeared to be terribly nervous. He speaks French quite passably, but he begged me to provide an interpreter, although he had nothing to do except to hand me the texts for perusal and return. 3. I do not feel that at this stage I can add anything useful to the comments contained in my telegram under reference. The situation seems to be approaching some sort of a denouement, and will probably have taken on a quite new aspect by the time you receive this despatch. I need only call your attention to the fact that the correspondence, judged by the references and internal evidence, does not appear to be quite complete. There is much about incidents in the frontier region, but little to indicate their exact nature. 4. You are aware that the Jebel Faifa is extremely marginal. In this connexion I may refer back to paragraph 5 of my despatch No. 23 of the 17th January, 1933. 5. Taufiq Bey left the telegrams with me on the understanding that I should return them to him as soon as possible. Before I could do so, however, he decided not to wait, and requested me to send the texts after him under cover of a personal letter. This gave me an opportunity of writing next day a letter, of which I enclose a copy^ 1 ) and of expressing in it my hope that the local incidents would be smoothed over, so as to enable the conference to meet in favourable conditions. 6. I still hear of great military activity in connexion with the collection of motor transport and the mobilisation of further troops. There is said to be much recruiting in the Northern Hejaz and the adjoining parts of Nejd. e.g., Hail. 7. With reference to the concluding portions of paragraph 5 of my despatch No.^l5_of the 23rd January, and paragraph 2 of my despatch No. 26 of the 30th January, I now learn from two independent sources, of which'Mr. Philby is one, that the Amir Feisal went three or four days ago to hunt at a place not far from Medina. This is unexpected news, as I rather thought that the Amir might leave Taif for the south at any moment. It is barely possible that the report of his going north is a blind, but it is hardly in the Saudi manner to use such a device rather than to maintain silence. Mr. Philby suggests that the Amir and the King may intend to meet, though not in the direction he at first suggested. He still says that the Amir is eager to go south, but that, in his opinion, the King will not let him go. As for myself, I am still greatly interested in the prince’s movements, but I prefer to hazard no surmise as to the ultimate intentions of either father or son in this respect. 8.

Section 2, [E 985/79/25] No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received February 13.) Jedda, January 27, 1934. (No. 22.) Sir, IN my despatch No. 15 of the 23rd January, I brought the story of the latest phase of the quarrel between~Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya up to the afternoon of the 23rd January, when Mr. Calvert handed to Fuad Bey Hamza the personal letter, a copy of which I enclosed in that despatch. There is little of importance to add to what I have telegraphed regarding the later developments, but as Fuad Bey is leaving for Abha to-morrow (not to-day, according to a telephone message he sent me this morning) this is a convenient moment to bring the subject up to date. 2. Fuad Bey read my letter in Mr. Calvert's presence. Before doing this he informed him of his projected visit to Abha, of which I had heard from Mr. Philby the evening before, and asked whether Mr. Calvert could put him in the way of borrowing a sextant, as he hoped incidentally to do something to clarify the geography of those regions. In the course of subsequent conversation he stated that the Yemeni delegate who was to meet him was Seyyid Abdullah Ibn Wazir, who until recently was in command of the Imam’s forces on the Asir Tihama front. Fuad Bey expressed himself hopefully about the projected meeting and described his outlook as “optimistic,” although, when using the word a second time, he rather qualified it. He did not refer to the movements of the heir apparent or to other matters of detail. He promised to convey my letter to the King by telegraph next day and to acquaint me with His Majesty’s reply. 3. I had been anxious not to meet Fuad Bey personally until he had received my letter. He called on me by arrangement on the morning of the 24th January and we discussed the situation fully on the lines reported in my telegram No. 11_ of that day. I enclose a fuller account of our conversation, not including the' sketch map referred to, which was merely a rough and extempore attempt to illustrate what Fuad Bey was telling me. 4. Fuad Bey returned to Mecca that afternoon. When we parted he thought it unlikely that he would start for Abha before the beginning of February, and even spoke of the possibility of another visit to Jedda. On the 25th January, however, he telephoned that he had had to expedite his plans and would be leaving for Abha on the 27th. I expressed satisfaction at this, as it is obviously desirable in the present highly electrical conditions that the meeting should take place as soon as possible. A few minutes later, he again telephoned to announce that the heir apparent had reached Abha on the 23rd January. 5. The Umm-al-Qura of yesterday published a brief announcement regarding the proposed meeting at Abha, giving the names of the two principal delegates and their dates of departure to attend the meeting. The object of the meeting was categorically described as being “the conclusion of the treaty referred to in the leading article in the last issue. ” 6. The same Umm-al-Qura announces that the heir apparent reached Abha on the 24th January, i.e., one day later than Fuad Bey had said; that he has assumed command there; and that he was accompanied by five junior piinces. The fact that the Amir is to be definitely in authority at Abha is significant. As vou will see by the enclosed record, Fuad Bey stressed the importance of sending to the south a personage of sufficient standing to take decisions. It is possible that the King has delegated to the prince wide powers to make either peace or war. 7. It is clear that the statement of the views of His Majesty’s Government which I conveyed to Fuad Bey on the 23rd January, has in no way affected t e nmirsft of events. I still consider it satisfactory, however, that the statement2 3 8. I have no further news regarding Saudi military preparations. The three barges are still lying peacefully off Jedda. The most significant pieces of information given me by Fuad Bey were that, when war seemed imminent, it wa;S intended to send the Amir Feisal, the King’s son, to the fi’ont, and that Ibn Rubaiyan, the Ateyba leader, had marched south. You will have seen froip^. the Koweit intelligence reports that this chieftain was, m the autumn, supposeu to be more than half-hearted, but eventually decided to obey the King. Early in the month it was widely rumoured that the Ateyba at Taif were in a rebellious mood and were even creating disturbances in the town. Whate\ei the facts, the Amir Feisal has gone personally to Taif two or three times since the beginning of January. It may well be that Ibn Rubaiyan s Ateyba have latterly been not so much disaffected as impatient for action. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to His Majesty’s Ambassador in Rome and to the Commissioner at Aden. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure in No. 1. Note respecting the Saudi-Yemen Situation. FUAD BEY HAMZA called on me this morning. We had a long conversa tion, parts of which were rather involved. The following, though not an exact record, gives the gist of what passed :— Fuad Bey confirmed what he had told Mr. Calvert yesterday afternoon about his proposed journey to Abha to meet a representative of the Imam. I asked whether this was to be the actual conference which had been foreshadowed or merely a preliminary. Fuad Bey said that, in the intentions of his Government, it was to be the conference. He added in reply to a further question that he would have colleagues, but he did not name them; nor did he appear to know of any Yemeni delegate other than Seyyid Abdullah Ibn Wazir, the general who has been in command at Haradh and who has now been called to Sana. News of this gentle man’s departure for Abha was awaited, and Fuad Bey would then proceed. He was to go from Mecca by car via Bisha. He hoped to vary his route coming back and to do some geographical work, but sounded doubtful as to whether he would venture as far as Najran for this purpose. I told Fuad Bey that I had been completely mystified by the apparent discrepancies between the Umm-al-Qura article of the 16th January, and what he had told me. I said that I now reduced the areas in dispute to three, although there might be more. Firstly, there was Asir Tihama. Here Ibn Saud was in a strong position, and my only difficulty was that we had never been told what the inland boundary of Asir Tihama was. The Saudi Government appeared to be unwilling to supply this information, though I had given him frequent opportunities of telling me the effect of the Saudi Idrisi Treaty of 1920. Inverting the geographical order, I next took Najran, both the history and geography of which were doubtful. If Fuad Bey was becoming a geographer, I was becoming an historian, and I could not discover that either of the disputants had really held Najran in recent times. That was why I favoured the idea of its being made a neutral area. Between these two areas I said there was a mountainous region, partly Asir Tihama and partly Asir Surat, though I could not say wdiere they met. I inferred from the L 1 mm-al-Qura article that the Beni Malik and Abadil, who appeared to be now an important bone of contention, were in the highlands of Asir Tihama. I explained why the account of events in the Umm-al-Qura article had so baffled me. It almost read as though the Amir Saud had gone off on his own, though this was in itself incredible. Why, for instance, had so important a personage got no wireless ? Fuad Bey observed that if there were any discrepancy between statements of his and a newspaper article, his own statements must naturally be preferred. He did not seriously pretend that the article was anything but inspired, but he intimated that some of the dates might not be quite right. His main line of defence was, however, that the Imam s actions were quite at variance with his words. The fact was that at some time before the 9th January the Imam’s activities among the Beni Malik and Abadil had gone the length of invasion andoccupation, and his forces were accompanied by Seyyid Abdul Wahhab al-Idrisi s promise to relegate the Idrisis to Zebid. It was in consequence of these activities, which had created a storm of indignation in Saudi circles, that arrangements had been made for the Amir Saud to go to the front and for his other the Amir Feisal (for it was to him and not to Feisal-bin-Saud that the Umm-al-Qura referred), to go south also. War seemed inevitable, and it was necessary that a person of the heir apparent’s authority should be on the spot to take decisions. He had gone off on a date of which Fuad Bey said he was himself ignorant, taking one of Sii F. Humphrys s wireless sets on which he could receive messages, but which could not transmit more than 200 miles. His objective was Bisha, but up to last evening there was no news of his arrival there. He would probably get there about now. Meanwhile, reassuring telegrams had come from the Imam and the Abha meeting had now been arranged. The trouble was that, when he sent his messages, the Imam had not discontinued his activities in the Beni Malik and Abadil country. The King, showing amazing patience, had fallen back there in order to avoid a conflict. Military preparations were still in progress on the Saudi side owing to the ambiguousness of the Imam’s attitude. The troops embarked here on the 16th January were part of the forces, which the Amir Feisal (Ibn Abdul-Aziz) was to have commanded. Ibn Rubaivan the Atayba leader, had also moved south from Taif. y ’ I observed that it was natural to suppose that the Amir Feisal mentioned by the Umm-al-Qura as having been ordered to march along the Tihama, was the Commander-in-chief in Asir. I was glad to get the correction, but it would be even graver if the King’s son, Feisal, had also been despatched. For the rest, I accepted Fuad Bey s explanations without much criticism and with sympathy, but said I had one complaint. I had been left to infer the importance of the Beni Malik and Abadil area in the recent stages. I looked for greater confidence than this showed. We had really done our utmost, more than he perhaps realised, to avert a conflict. We had used influence to restrain the Imam, indirectly—he knew what I meant—and then directly when the presence of Colonel Reilly at Sana gave us the opportunity. It was a condition of using influence with the Imam that we should use influence with Ibn Saud. We could only work with the Italians in friendly understanding, all the more so as the European situation required close collaboration with them. I had been really alarmed just after the 16th January lest war should be imminent and my Government had shared my alarm. Hence the letter I had sent to him yesterday under instructions. Mr. Calvert, I said, had foreshadowed a written communication in the event of the issue of an ultimatum when it was thought that an ultimatum might be issued at any moment. The situation after the 16th January had presented an appearance so comparable in its dangerousness that the written communication had now been made. Fuad Bey assured me of the King’s pacific intentions. The King could not put up with anything and everything, but he had astonished Fuad and others by his patience, e.g., by falling back in the Beni Malik and Abadil area. He himself, Fuad, was strongly desirous of peace. What the King held he must hold, but the country needed repose. They could not put their house in order if there were always troubles. He would go to Abha full of the most sincere desire to arrive at a settlement. I said that for my part I had been firm in the belief that there would be no war if the King could avoid it, and that all His Majesty’s efforts were directed towards an honourable settlement. I admitted that the Imam was a very difficult person to negotiate with. I expressed confidence that every effort would be made on the baudi side to reach a satisfactory conclusion at Abha and wished Fuad every success in his mission. In the course of the conversation Fuad Bey showed me roughly on a map the lie of the land. He traced the boundary between Asir Tihama and the Yemen in a sort of S shape, starting eastward from the sea, then running northward so as to leave the Jebel Razih on the Yemeni side and Jebel Faifa on the Saudi side further north; then bending round again to the east. He placed the Abadil and the Beni Malik along this last bend, that is to say north of the Jebel Faifa. He half promised to send me a sketch map on the lines of the attached very rough pencil sketch^) which he made to illustrate his explanation. A. R. January 24,1934.

DeaTs^Andrew, Mecca, January ZS, 1934. I AM writing to you just before I leave Mecca for Abha in order to acknowledge your private letter of the 23rd January, 1934 about the development of the situation between this country and the Yemen. We had a conversation on this question on Wednesday last, which I believe has shown you the truth ot the matter and has made clear that the measures taken were by way of preparation for eventualities, once it had been proved to us that the actions of Imam Yahya were at variance with his statements. I have communicated a copy of your letter, referred to above, to the proper person, and have also indicated the explanations I made to you. It was then found most appropriate that 1 snou d s umm arise the recent situation for you as follows . Our attitude as regards our desire for peace and friendship with the Imam Yahya remains unchanged. Our proof of this is the manner m which we have strongly urged the Imam Yahya to have the difficulty brought to an end while all our forces are concentrated on the frontiers and entirely ready, but have taken no action, thank God, which might provoke a quarrel between us and Yahya, and in spite of our having ascertained that while he was corresponding and compacting with us for peace and friendship he was, on the other hand, doing Di e opposite by provoking insurrection in the Tihama area; for he sent Abdul-al- Wahhab-al-Idrisi, who is under his protection and for whose action he is responsible, gave him money and arms and thus stirred up the inhabitants of the highlands of the Tihama such as the Ahl Eaifa, the Beni Malek and the Aba i until they expelled those of our Amirs who were with them. He also took pledge from the people of those mountains. The Imam’s intention m deferring a settle^ ment is to cause insurrection and strife so that, if he finds an opportunity he will break the peace and do whatever he likes. His Majesty the King has frankly acquainted^Yahya with the facts and strengthened the forces with extra ones m2 preparation for eventualities. He has also issued his orders to his Highness the Amir Saud to proceed to that quarter for two reasons . after the TmlmYahya had broken (his) promise, when we feared that ou^ trlbe LwV-To ate modify the system of war in preparation for eventualities. our posts in the mountain district, also in preparation for eventualities. What seems most probable is that the position will be altered y the insurrection which the Imam Yahya is stirring up. It is therefore not unlikely that incidents will occur as actually did happen with Abdul Wahhab-ai-ldrisi, particularly because all the people of the Tihama who are subjects of Imam Yahya are saying that the Imam wants peace negotiations only to deceive so that he can subsequently find an opportunity to break his engagements. Despite all this His Majesty’s orders are continually issued to prevent any advance to the frontiers of the Yemen. The situation will remain the same until the conclusion of the conference which is to be held at Abha, whether or not that conference succeeds. If, however, there occurs a definite act of hostility on the part of the Imam Yahya, we shall then have to defend ourselves. Yours sincerely, FUAD HAMZA.&gt; [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] From SAUDI A RABIA , ecypher.

Jedda, January 23, 1934. ’ WITH reference to previous correspondence ending with my telegram No. 9 of the 21st January, I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of the article on Saudi-Yemen relations, which appeared in the Mecca Umm-al-Qura of the 16th January, a number produced exceptionally on that day in anticipation of the three days’ festival which follows Ramadan. Having regard to Fuad Bey Hamza’s statements to me on the 9th and 16th January, as reported by telegraph, I have seldom seen a more curious publication. Fuad Bey had told me on the former date that Ibn Saud had made a fresh gesture of conciliation and that the Imam’s reply to the King’s latest proposals was awaited. He told me at midday on the 16th January, by telephone from Mecca, that this position was unchanged. Yet the Umm-al-Qura had produced that very morning the obviously inspired article, with which I am now dealing. . . tj ; 2 It is pretty clear that the question of Yemeni activities m the Beni Malik and Abadil area has come into the forefront of the dispute between Ibn Saud and the Imam. My maps and books of reference do not enable me to locate that area, but it would appear to be somewhere m the mountains between Jizan and Sada. As I stated in paragraph 3 of my despatch of the 10th January, Fuad Bey started his conversation with me on the 9th January by a reterence to the Imam’s intrigues among the Beni Malik, but he presently minimised their importance. It is significant that, in the account given by Colonel Reilly see Foreign Office telegram No. 6 of the 17th January, of proposals said to have been made by the Imam, he is repFesented as having asked for the neutralisation ot the Beni Malik. It is also significant that mention is made m the Aden Intelligence Summarv of the 20th December of a reported application by the Imam’s commander at Haradh for sanction to march against the Jebel Beni 3 ' If the Umm-al-Qura article be taken at its face value, it reads, almost as though the heir apparent had gone off on his own, especially as it is implied that he started without a wireless set. I confess that this interpretation, though it would rationalise the article, is intrinsically improbable. The Amir baud is reputed to be a bit of a fanatic, and his published appeal to the King at the time of the Ibn Rifada affair was an almost reproachful cry of Let s up and at ’em ”; but I have no other reason to suppose that he would dety a parent so strenuous as Ibn Saud. . , , 4 Mr. Philby came to see me on the 22nd January, having returned on the 19th January 'from spending the festival in Mecca He does not pretend to be in the inner secrets of the Saudi Government, and he admitted that the situation was most puzzling. He pooh-poohed the Umm-al-Qura article, however, and said that he had not read it, and from what he had heard did not think it worth reading, and maintained stoutly that the heir apparent had not ielt Riyadh until the 15th January, when he had himself sent me, through Mrs. Philby, the news of the Amir’s departure. I insisted that an obviously inspired article of this kind in a paper like the Umm-al-Qura °. ou ld not be dismissed so lightly, especially as it could be construed 80 J 11 . , th ® indicated in the preceding paragraph^ Mr. Philby suggested that it was Ml eve-wash He admitted that it could have no value as eye-wash for the Imam, and suggested rather feebly that it was intended to reassure public opinion in this country. I observed that, if that were the object, the Saudi Government had set about it in a very extraordinary fashion. i 5 Mr Philby gave me two pieces of information which, if confirmed, are more important tlial his opinions, for, though not in the inner secret, he has [31 n—1]2 / 3 ft many important contacts. He said that a meeting was to take place at Abha between Fuad Bey Hamza and a representative of the Imam, and that Fuad Bey was only awaiting news of the Yemeni representative s movements before himself starting Mr. Philby did not think, and represented Fuad Bey as not thinking, that this meeting could produce an agreement. He regards war as inevitable. His second bit of news was that both the King and the Amir Feisal^ his son were going a hunting and that they were to meet. The Amir Feisal, he sa d waTmade kL to go to the front, but had not been authorised to do so. Mr. Philby did not think that Ibn Saud would be persuaded to deprive the Hejaz of its Viceroy, but the convergence of the two hunts would take the King himself within easier distance of the front „ tv. ^ 6 I regret that my information should be so imperfect. I share a general ignorance of what is really toward. Fuad Bey has lam low m Mecca since the 16th December, until to-day, when he arrived unexpectedly in Jedda about midday, and I could not put the questions I should like to ask him by telephone^ Humours reach me in waves, but they are of no value. The latest is that 8,000 of the Atayba have left Taif for the front. The only thing that I can at present with my own eyes is three-fourths of the Saudi fleet, the three barges see WJ.UU my vj vr— * ~~ _ ' ^ , mentioned in my telegram No. 6_of the 16th January. It was generally supposed that they would follow iheUesfe steamer, which embarked anything up to 800 soldiers of sorts for Jizan on the 16th December; but they have continued to lie peacefully in full view of my house. 7. The one good result of all these singularities is that they enabled me, in spite of my earlier doubts, to suggest in my telegram NojFof the 21st January a form of communication to Fuad Bey, which would show both the Saudi and the Italian Governments that His Majesty’s Government were concerned to do what little they could do by words to attempt to restrain Ibn Saud from rushing into war. I received early this morning the telegram, in which you were good enough to approve of this suggestion. I enclose a copy of a letter which I have addressed to Fuad Bey. As I have said above he has arrived in Jedda unexpectedly to-day. The news reached me while my letter was being prepared for signature and while I was drafting this despatch. Being anxious that the letter should reach him before we met, I arranged for Mr. Calvert to deliver it to him personally at 4-30 p.m. I will report any further developments as soon as I have myself seen Fuad Bey. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to His Majesty’s representative at Rome and to the Commissioner at Aden. Motives of economy have prevented me from repeating my telegrams to the latter, since I warned him on the 15th January that the situation had deteriorated to an extent which made war a possible eventuality, but I trust that this paper will bring his information up to date. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. -SA Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Extract from the Mecca Umm-al-Qura, No. 475 of January 16, 1934. Between Riyadh and Sana. (Translation.) THE exchange of telegraphic communications between His Majesty the King and his Highness Imam Yahya to settle the trouble between the two countries is still going on and His Majesty is still strongly persisting in his efforts for a settlement of the questions in dispute. After a long exchange of communications, the two parties agreed telegraphically on the question of the Idrisis and their position. The Imam Yahya then agreed that the frontier between the two countries should be delimited and that a Treaty of Friendship and Fraternity should be concluded between the two parties for a period of twenty years. The question of Najran has remained unsettled up till now. His Majesty the King finally suggested to his Highness the Imam Yahya that the two questions already agreed upon should be definitely settled and that thetreaty should be drawn up, signed and made public immediately. As regards the question of Najran, negotiations should be conducted in a conference to be held for that purpose by delegations from the two parties, with a view to settling it in such a manner as to preserve the interests of both and to prevent harm befalling them. There is still a strong hope that the proposed conference will ^ercome the difficulties and settle the trouble in a way which will preserve the interests of both parties as well as the interests of the people of Najran themselves. His Majesty the King sent this suggestion to his Highness the Imam Yahya on the 17th Ramadan (the 3rd January, 1934), but his Highness the Imam Yahya, as frequently happens, delayed his reply either accepting or refusing the suggestion. It happened during that time that certain of those in the mountains of the Tihamat Asir caused disturbances because of the intrigues of certain of his Highness The Imam Yahya’s Amirs, which caused a bad effect, particularly in Nejd. Meanwhile, orders had already been issued to his Highness the Amir Saud, heir apparent of the Saudi Arab Kingdom, to march south with a Nejdi force; orders had likewise been issued to his Highness the Amir Feisal to march south along the Tihama coast. On the 23rd Ramadan (the 9th January, 1934), however, a message was received from his Highness the Imam Yahya to the effect that he agreed to the suggestion of His Majesty the King and that his Highness admitted the activities and interference of his Amirs, in the matter of stirring up disturbances, amongst the Bani Malik and the Abadil. He stated that he had issued orders to prevent this and asked His Majesty to grant pardon to those who had committed these acts; and he manifested readiness to conclude the treaty and to depute a delegation. Thereupon orders were at once issued to the Amir Feisal to stop his march, but the Amir Saud had already started with a force in cars, and it was not possible for the orders to return to reach him; so he continued on his way. The Government have made certain that the attitude of his Highness the Amir Saud in that direction of the kingdom will be one ensuring tranquillity in affairs and precluding any aggression or hostility, unless the situation should necessitate it for purposes of defence, which the Government hope will not be the case, they hope also that his Highness the Imam Yahya will expedite the settlement of the matter, so that the Islamic and Arab worlds may repose in the amicable settlement of this affair. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Fuad Bey. My dear Fuad Bey, Jedda, January 23, 1934. I HAVE naturally kept my Government fully informed of our conversations regarding the situation between this country and the Yemen, including that of the 9th January when your Excellency was good enough to inform me of the latest proposals made by His Majesty the King to the Imam, the reply to which was awaited, and your telephone message of the 16th January, when you told me that the situation was unchanged, but that the Imam’s reply was expected that evening or the next day. I also telegraphed to the Secretary of State a summary of the article which appeared in the Umm-al-Qura of the 16th January, and which is referred to in the following communication, which I have been instructed to make to your Excellency in the form of a personal letter. My Government learnt on the 13th January that Colonel Reilly, who as you know has been at Sana for some time, had just urged on the Imam, not for the first time, the desirability of a friendly settlement of the differences between him and His Majesty and was told that negotiations between the two rulers were progressing. This seemed to tally with what your Excellency had told me on the 9th January, even though the question of Najran still presented difficulty, and as I have stated above, you told me on the 16th January that the position was unchanged. In these circumstances, His Majesty’s Government, whose only object is to promote peace and stability in Arabia, are perturbed to learn from the Umm-al-Qura that in consequence of some local disturbance His Royal Highness the heir apparent had been ordered to the front before the arrival of a,1 Imam on the 9th January, and that the Commander- telegram despatched by ^ in-chief m Asir had also bee u mm -al-Qura that the latter advance was ^though rtrs stated m the^ ^ of the 9th Ja my countermanded on tne rece p ig a ser i 0 us danger of an outbreak of Government cannot but tea isunderstand i ng 0 n each side as to the intention hostilities as a result of me ^ Saudi Government, who have given so of the other.

It was the same messenger who brought back the serious news which I telegraphed to you under my Ho.25, dated the 26th January 1934, although you will notice that the King makes no mention of a crisis at all , accord ing to +he Bhaikh he naturally would not do this). \ 5. your information the full story as brought by i the messenger is as follows: The Enir Baaiyed al %isal, Commander of the advance troops on the left flank of Bin Baud’s forces, had V— (early in January) made a sudden and treacherous attack on a force of about 1,000 of the Imam Yahya’s array in/ _ cal Agency, Kuwait, Hated the 28th January 1934.&amp; in the vicinity of ^a&amp;r (^ejran)o ^he latter had heen completely sumrified and had lost t'oo rn9T11 “killed* The occurrence took place during a truce when full peace negotiations -were proceeding and after Bin 3aud had issued most stringent orders to all hie generals that no aggressive move whatever was to he und er taken. As a result of 'he incident the Xman Yahya at once broke off all peace conversations, and ordered his armies to hold themselves in readiness for an immediate offensive. Bin Baud had at once dismissed Saayid bin Yaisal and had telegraphically disowned, the attack and expressed regrets, bu**- the Imam Yahya had refused to accept his explanations. A couple of days before the messenger left Biath, Bin Baud believing war to be eminent , had sent his son the Hhir Baud post haste to Ybha to take supreme command of the Saudi armies in Asir. Yith him had gone all available troops in Biath (800 men) in 80 light lorries under the following members of the B 0 yal ? amily: Xhalid bin M oh am eel as Baud. ? ahad bin Ba’ad al Baud, 6. His Excellency the Bhaikh when telling me the above storv stated that hitherto he had not believed there would be any war, but in view of his man's story he feared only a miracle could avert hostilities now. r ?hat made him more pessimistic was the fact that he/I -3~ » ^ — 1 ,4 he had received by the Air Mail of 19th January, a letter dated the 10th frow a Kuwait subject in Aden to the effect that Yahya appeared entirely bent on war and had concentrated all available troops on the Asir front and was sending large quantities of ams and amrmnitions to the tribes of Asir* 7* '^hile 1 think it somewhat early to accent the story of the Shaikh’s messenger, I nevertheless fear there may be considerable truth in his report. rt he char re in the attitude of the Shaikh is in itself disturbing. In the past he has always been very confident that no breach would take place. P 0 1 note that news from Bahrain (23.1.34) has it that the Amir Baud only went to Asir to meet the Imam Yahya’s son preparatory to fixing boundaries between the two States, as a result of peace having been declared.

Ryan to Sir John Simon.—[Received Januai^y 30.) gj r ^ Jedda, January 10, 1934. FOR several days after I despatched my telegram No. 226 of the 29th December, there was in Jedda an almost uncanny dearth of news, or even rumours, regarding the Saudi-Yemen situation. A few small straws in the wind seemed to indicate vaguely that it might again be blowing up for war. A. posse of well-known ulema arrived in Mecca from Nejd. The object of their visit might have been to stimulate martial ardour, but this surmise is discounted by the fact that it is now Ramadan, a month which the devout like to spend wholly or partly in Mecca! The King’s cousin Saud-al-Arafa (see personalities report 1 (23)), who had come to the Hejaz for that purpose, returned unexpectedly to Riyadh. This prince, though outwardly loyal, is believed to be somewhat ill-affected towards the King, and the latter might well like to keep him under his immediate eye, if His Majesty were starting on a distant expedition. Finally, the Emir Feisal, who had promised to dine with Mr. and Mrs. Philby on the 7th January, postponed the engagement at short notice until the 9th, in order to go once more to Taif to review the troops there. 2. The Amir came from Taif to Jedda on the 8th January for the usual dinner in honour of the King’s accession. Fuad Bey Hamza came down for the same event, and I had a conversation with him on the 9th January. He described the situation as still uncertain. He stated that some days earlier war had f appeared imminent. The King, however, in his eagerness for peace, had made I a further concession by proposing to leave the question of Najran in suspense pending a meeting of delegates at Sana or elsewhere, perhaps a place near the frontier, who could discuss the question at the same time that they recorded in treaty form the agreement already reached in principle regarding the de facto frontier between Asir and Yemen and the disposal of the Idrisi. Fuad Bey said that he was himself to attend the conference, if it took place, a decision which would appear to indicate the King’s wish to ensure precision in any written agreement, as Fuad Bey has had a greater experience of negotiations on civilised lines than any of His Majesty’s present advisers. 3. At the outset of the conversation Fuad Bey referred to the Imam’s intrigues among the Beni Malik, as though this grievance still existed or had recently revived, but he presently dismissed it as a subsidiary matter. He complained generally of the impossibility of getting straight answers from the Imam, who indulged freely in evasive verbiage. He was unable to tell me anything more about the actual situation in Najran. I questioned him guardedly as to the report reproduced in the penultimate sentence of my telegram No226 of the 29th December, describing it simply as a rumour which I had heard. Fuad Bey admitted that certain elements near the frontier, who were co-operating with Ibn Baud but did not form part of his organised forces, had joined the local Najran tribes in repulsing the Yemenis. He said that there had still been no clash between the accredited forces of the two rulers, and that Ibn Baud had explained to the Imam the character of those concerned on his side. Although/ any such incident must necessarily be disquieting, I do not think that undue importance need be attached to this particular affair, as it does not seem to have interrupted the curious course of negotiations between principals. 4. We must still be prepared for all contingencies, but my present impres sion is that Ibn Baud is most anxious to avoid war. He may well think that it would be better in any case to postpone it, if it is to come, until the failure of a formal conference of delegates had demonstrated clearly the impossibility of any reasonable agreement with the Imam. This policy is attended by one disadvantage, namely, that there is not much cool weather left for fighting. On the other hand, a break-down of negotiations on all the points at issue would [6 gg—4]enable the King to present armed action in a more justifiable light to the Arab and Islamic woflds It would also allow time for such pilgrims as intend to come to S“az this year, but have not yet started, to get too well on the way to recede for fear “f^^ances ^ e o ^ s d g“ patch to His Majesty’s representative at Rome.

CONFIDENTIAL. , ~ f Section 1. ^ ^ • Q ? [E 504/79/25] No. 1. Sir A . Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received January 22.) (No. 1.) Sir, Jedda, January 2, 1934. WITH reference to your despatch No^333_of the 14th December, I have the honour to state that, in my opinion, any~claim by the Saudi Government to Hodeida on the ground that it was formerly Idrisi territory would be untenable, as untenable as the suggestion that the Idrisi could not validly cede rights further north to Ibn Saud, without the Imam’s consent. When Fuad Bey spoke to Mr. Calvert of the possibility of a claim to Hodeida, he would appear to have been using it merely as a makeweight in his demonstration of the reasonableness of Ibn Saud. I am confirmed in this appreciation by a conversation which I myself had with Fuad Bey on the 29th December. I pointed out to him, among other things, that Hodeida was in fact in British occupation for over three months after the date assigned in the Saudi-Idrisi Treaty of 1926 to the earlier treaty between Ibn Saud and the Idrisi. The date of that treaty is given as the 10th Safar, 1339, or about the 22nd October, 1920. The British forces evacuated Hodeida, which the Idrisi thereupon occupied, at the end of January 1921. I cannot discover that the Idrisi had at any previous time held Hodeida, although he had been given possession of Loheya soon after the armistice with Turkey, according to the Survey of International A ffairs for 1925, vol. I, p. 320. According to p. 322 of the same volume, he was compelled to evacuate Loheya early in 1925 and Hodeida on the 27th March of that year. So far as Hodeida is concerned, therefore, he would appear not to have been in possession either on the date of the Saudi-Idrisi Treaty of 1920 or on the date of the subsequent treaty of 1926. 2. I agree that it is very difficult to apply legal tests to the claims and counter-claims as to how the frontier between what is now Saudi Arabia and the Yemen should be drawn. Some rational conclusions may, however, be deducible from a study of the history of the Yemen and Asir since 1872, when the Turkish Government included both in the newly constituted Vilayet of the Yemen, although they separated them, to the best of my belief , between 1908 and 1911. I gave certain reasons for the latter belief in ^a memorandum which I wrote in London before returning from leave, but of which I have no copy. Such enquiries as I have been able to make since tend to confirm it. I have before me a calendar in Turkish for the Turkish financial year 1327 (the 14th March, 1911, to the 13th March, 1912), which, though unofficial, shows clearly that, at that time, there were only two outlying sanjaks of the Yemen Vilayet, viz., Hodeida and Taiz, and that Asir was' already an ££ independent” sanjak, i.e., one directly under Constantinople, though not administered by a Vali. 3. I am at present engaged in an attempt to put together in outline an historical study of the kind indicated in the preceding paragraph. If Ibn Saud and the Imam come to a real settlement in the near future it may not be worth while to pursue this rather difficult task. Should I complete it, I will venture to submit the results for verification and correction by experts. For the moment I content myself with drawing your attention to the fact that the handbooks drawn up by the Arab Bureau and the Admiralty in 1916-17 describe the Wadi f Ain, which falls into the sea at parallel 16°, as the then limit of Idrisi expansion. In my opinion, anv subsequent extension of the Idrisi’s authority further to the south must be regarded as having been in the nature of a purely temporary occupation. I think it will be found, though I am not in possession of the whole correspondence, that even when His Majesty’s Government allowed the Idrisi to occupy first Loheya and then Hodeida, they were unwilling to commit them selves to the position that these places were being assigned to him permanently. Having regard to all that has happened since, I should say that the reasonable lie of a frontier towards the sea would be somewhere from the Wadi Tashar to the Wadi Ain.2 ) * 4 While the foregoing observations may appear to be at once meagre and discursive I think they provide the best approach to the specific matters, on which vou have been good enough to consult me. Before dealing with them I have to record one point which emerged from my conversation with huad Bey on the 29th December. When I mentioned the Wadi Tashar as being the terminal on the sea of the frontier, as described by the Saudi Government themselves last yeai;. (see my despatch No. 113 of the 14th April, 1933), Fuad Bey said that the actua frontier abutted on the sea a little further south, i.e., at a place called Muwassim, 8 kilom. north of Medi, and that that place was occupied by Saudi forces. This may account for the recent recrudescence of rumours, which, however, I still believe to be confounded, of clashes between Saudi and Yemeni^ forces in the immediate neighbourhood of Medi. Be this as it may, Fuad Bey s statement is important as a matter of precision, although it does not affect the main argument of the present despatch. 5. Although the Saudi-Idrisi Treaty of 1920 has not been published, I think it can safely be assumed that it had no bearing on the frontier between the territory remaining to the Xdrisi and the Yemen. It is conceivable that Ibn Sand may have promised the Idrisi support in resisting encroachment by the Imam, but the only frontier that could have been definitely determined between the parties was an inland one, as the Idrisi was then treating as an independent ruler, with the Yemen to the south of him and the Hejaz to the north. It indeed seems probable that Ibn Saud and the Idrisi did not define the whole even of the inland frontier between them. In Mr. Mayers’ despatch to the Foreign Office, No. 6 of the 19th January, 1927, Dr. Abdullah Damluji is described as having said that the treaty of 1920 ct only defined the north-south frontier in-the Muhail-Abha region .... and did not attempt to make a partition between Asir and the territory of the Imam Yahya.” I derived the same impression from my conver sation with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 29th December, and it is strengthened by a consideration of the situation at the time. Any agreement between the Idrisi and Ibn Saud, recognising the latter as ruler of portions of inland Asir bordering on the Yemen, might have precipitated a question between Ibn Saud and the Imam; but in 1920 Ibn Saud was pursuing another objective which made it specially important for him to disinterest the Idrisi in the Abha region. This was the absorption into his dominions of that region, in which the head of the former ruling family, the Beni Aidh, had made himself independent after the Turkish evacuation at the end of 1918. Ibn Saud achieved this immediate object in 1922. 6. It appears to me fairly certain that Ibn Saud did not become seriously interested in the frontier between what is now Asir Tihama and the Yemen until the time of the second treaty, which he made with the Idrisi in 1926. As he was then acquiring definite rights over what had been the Idrisi’s territory, and as the Idrisi had been hard pressed by the Imam, it became important for tbn Saud to make sure that he was getting all the territory to which the Idrisi could give a title. I agree that the transfer might be held to include territory from which the Idrisi had been wrongfully ejected by the Imam, but for the reasons given in paragraph 3 above, I do not think that places like Hodeida, or even Loheya, could be regarded then or now as having at any time been a part of the Idrisi’s dominions. In my view, what the Imam did in regard to those places in 1925 was not to dispossess the Idrisi of what had lawfully been his, but to recover what the Idrisi had recently and impermanently occupied. All historical considera tions seem to show that both Hodeida and Loheya form part of the Yemen proper as distinct from Asir. 7. Before dealing with the one remaining question, I may mention the one possible counter-argument which has occurred to me. It might be suggested that no new rights accrued in a legal sense in any of the territories concerned until the coming into force of the Treaty of Lausanne between Turkey and the Allies, and that each ruler’s rights should depend on what he actually held at that moment. This argument might be used in support of an Idrisi claim and a consequential Saudi claim to Hodeida and Loheya, which places the Idrisi had in his possession at that moment, but I do not think it could be seriously sustained. The point had come into my head before my conversation of the 29th December with Fuad Bey, and I was interested to hear him throw out a reference to the Treaty of Lausanne as having determined the ultimate legal situation, but it was quite casual and theoretical. I pass to the more material question of the alleged agreement of 1931 between Ibn Saud and the Imam.8. I can add little or nothing to what yon already know regarding what passed in 1931, but it may be useful to give some account of the setting. We know that Ibn Saud claims to have come to an agreement with the Imam about the irontier inland at the end of 1927. The most precise account of this is given in Mr. Zada’s letter to Mr. Rendel of the 28th July last. Mr. Zada there states ^ that on the 7th Rajab, 1346 (about the 31st December, 1927), the Saudi mission then in feana made a proposal to the Imam’s representatives, and that two days later the latter accepted it, “ except where it related to the Idrisi territory.” Even assuming the Saudi account of this affair to be correct, it is obvious that an exception in regard to Idrisi territory might be interpreted in various ways. The Idrisi had ruled mountainous regions in inland Asir at the height of his power. Muhammad-bin-Dhulaim, who actually figured in the 1927-28 negotia tions as one of Ibn Sand’s representatives, had previously been the Idrisi’s Governor in the country of the settled Qahtan (see Admiralty Handbook of Arabia, vol. I, p. 441). It is therefore evident that the words “ Idrisi territory ” might have very different meanings for Ibn Saud and for the Imam. Anyhow, the situation ran on until the autumn of 1931, when the Imam occupied Jebel Arwa, and precipitated some sort of a fresh frontier settlement. All we know about this is that in December 1931 Ibn Saud renounced any claim to Jebel Arwa, and that his delegates signed what he regards as a treaty of friendship, &amp;c. This treaty, which, if ratified, was ratified in a very singular fashion, contains no reference to frontiers, and nothing has ever been published on this subject, except the announcement of the relinquishment of Jebel Arwa by Ibn Saud. It may, I think, be said that there is a de facto frontier running inland from Muwassim to the north of Jebel Arwa and of Sada, but except as regards these two points, the first of which Ibn Saud ceded in 1931, and the second of which he admits to be in the Yemen, I think it would be unsafe, in the present state of our knowledge, to speak of either an understanding or a working agreement between the two rulers. Fuad Bey might well feel free to suggest that nothing was agreed to in 1931 which would affect Ibn Saud’s right to Hodeida. But, as I have indicated above, I do not think the suggestion is meant to be taken seriously. It would, m my opinion, become important only if Ibn Saud were negotiating with the Imam after a successful war. 9. The historical review foreshadowed in paragraph 3 above will, if completed, deal to some extent with Nejran. That subject is not relevant to the present despatch, but I may say for the sake of completeness that I doubt whether, since the latter part of the eighteenth century, &amp;ny of the rulers mentioned in j this despatch, whether Turks, Imam, Idrisi or Ibn Saud have ever established a If position in the region of the Wadis Nejran and Habuna sufficiently dominant || and durable to serve as the basis of a solid claim to sovereignty. This view seems |i to underlie Ibn Saud’s suggestion that it should be regarded as a sort of buffer W or neutral territory between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, a solution which, in mv opinion, has much to commend it. ’ ' ™ : 10.

Sir E. Drummond to Sir John Simon. — (Received. January 30.) (No. 84.) gj r Rome, January 26, 1934. I HAVE the honour to inform you that I received on the 23rd January your telegram No. 30, instructing me to inform the Italian Government unofficially of the communication which Sir Andrew Ryan had been authorised to address to Fuad Bey Hamza concerning the threatened outbreak of hostilities in South-West Arabia. Since I had not yet taken action on your despatch No. 39 of the 15th January, instructing me to inform the Italian Government, in terms which were left to my discretion, that His Majesty’s Government were no longer prepared to enter into conversations in Rome regarding the Arabian situation, it occurred to me that the two communications might suitably be combined in a private letter to Signor Suvich, who, as you will remember, wrote to me personally on the 29th December, enclosing three notes verhales from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. ^ ^ ^ 2. I accordingly addressed to his Excellency on the 24th January the personal letter of which I now enclose a copy. You will observe that I have made use of the discretion given me with the object, in the terms of ^oui despatch under reference, of avoiding the creation of an unfavourable impression or detailed and useless discussion. In these circumstances, I trust you will not demur to my having inserted a paragraph about the pressure of work m your Department more especially since the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs have been informed verbally on more than one occasion of the difficulty with which an expert could be spared and the considerable notice which would, in any case, have to be gi\en before he was able to arrive in Rome. i- 3 As I pointed out in my telegram No 22 of the 19th January, the Italian Government are likely to be a little sore at the refusal of His Majesty’s Govern- foiro nart. in thfi nronosed conversations. It is fortunate, theretore, that certainly appreciate. I have, &amp;c. r ERIC DRUMMOND. Enclosure in No. 1. [6 gg—1] ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY LETTER NO.

In these ciicumstances, His Maiesty’s Government, whose only object is to promote peace and stability in Arabia,' are perturbed to learn that, before the arrival of a telegram despatched by the Imam on the 9th January, the heir apparent had been ordered to the fror^ as a consequence of some local disturbance and that the Commander-in-chief m Asir had been instructed to advance. Although the advance of the latter appears to have been now countermanded, it seems that, as a result of some misunderstanding on each side as to the intentions of the other, there is a serious danger of an outbreak of hostilities. His Majesty’s Government accordingly express the earnest hope that the Saudi Government, who have given so many proofs of their desire for peace, will do their utmost to avert the irreparable misfortune of war. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs was to be asked to convey this message to the King, with an assurance that it was inspired by the friendliest motives, and that His Majesty’s Government were ready to continue to use their good offices to promote an amicable settlement if the negotiations were continued. I feel that the Italian Government will appreciate the motives which have inspired this communication, and that, for their part, they will continue to use all their influence with the Imam to arrive at a reasonable settlement with Ibn Baud. In the circumstances explained above, and for certain other reasons which I shall proceed to describe, His Majesty’s Government have come to the conclusion that it would not be desirable to proceed, for the present,, with the proposed conversations referred to in the Ministry’s note verbale of the 23rd December last, enclosed in your letter to me of the 29th December. One of the principal grounds for arriving at this decision has been the fact that, as emphasised in the Ministry’s note verbale of the 23rd December, as well as in previous corres pondence on the subject, the points of view of the Italian and British Governments in regard to (a) the status of Asir, and (b) the Imam’s claim to that territory, are obviously very far from reconciliation. My Government would, of course, be quite prepared still further to elaborate their own ideas on the subject if the Italian Government so desire, but for the moment the question seems to be to a certain extent academic. Moreover, while the actual position in South-West Arabia is still admittedly obscure, it is certain that up to a short time ago great efforts were clearly being made on both sides to arrive at an agreed settlement without recourse to war. In these circumstances it seems possible that the proposed conversations might be misunderstood locally and give rise to rumours which would impede, rather than facilitate, the peaceful solution of the dispute. * In any case, my Government would find it difficult at this moment to send out a suitable expert from London, as the competent Department of the Foreign Office is extremely hard pressed. I hope that your Excellency will appreciate the force of the considerations which I have set forth above. Our two Governments may, and very likely will, continue to differ in regard to the specific problem of Asir; but I am convinced that we shall continue to collaborate in regard to the larger question of the prevention of war, and I have some hope that the last demarche of our Minister, coupled with any representations which the Italian Government may, for their part, see fit to take with the Imam, may result in a successful solution of our difficulties. k'97, A CYPHSS?

On the 20th Decemher it was reported that His Majesty King Bin Sa’ud had recently despatched additional forces from the ’Ajman and Murra’ trihes to ’Asir. After joining the Sa’udian forces at Jaran they made attacks on certain of the Yemeni military posts and recaptured some villages fran the Yemeni forces. His Majesty also issued orders to Bin Ruhai’an (of the ’Ataibah tribe) to proceed to ’Asir. 2. It was reported on the 30th December that His Majesty, fearing that Colonel Reilly’s Mission portended that the British Government would recognise the Imam Yahyah’s claim to ’Asir and ITajran, had ordered the Yam tribes to attack the Yemeni forces. On the 9th December these tribes were said to have marched out from Abha towards Khamis al Mishait , and to have driven the Yemeni forces frcm the ^adi Badr and the Wadi Habuna. The Yemeni forces thereupon retired to Sad ah leaving Najran in the nands of the Yam tribes. The casualties on both sides are said to have amounted to seven hundred men killed. 3. It was reported on the 30th December that trouble had broken out on the borders of Tihamah and ’Asir and that Ahmad al Shuwai’ir, the ’Amir of Jar in, had sent to the troubled area a detachment of one thousand men, who had quelled the trouble after killing about fifty of the ring-P.Z. 767/34.

He suggests more doubtfully that Imam's forces have crossed the frontier whereas he himself has observed mutual agreement that forces should keep away from the frontier.

'A [E 79/79/25] No. 1. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—{Received January 3, 1934.) gSo. 312.) Jedda, December 12, 1933. ’ SINCE my despatch No. 339 of the 27th November last, in which I had the honour to bring certain further information regarding the present state of tension between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen to your notice, the chief interest m the situation has centred in developments in the long-range negotiations, if such they may be termed, now proceeding between the two rulers. I do not propose o recount these in detail, as I venture to think they have been adequately reported to you by telegram, beyond briefly indicating the stage to which these exchanges have now come. According to Fuad Bey Hamza, there would now appear to be some prospect of a preliminary understanding over two of the Saudi tour points, viz., the “ minor ” one (to quote Fuad Bey) of the disposal of the Idrisi; and Nairan. , , . x • i • 2 With regard to the former, it seems that Ibn Sand is willing to waive his demand for the Idrisi’s extradition and, in return, the Imam has agreed to remove him from the danger-zone of the frontier to the interior of the Yemen. It is understood the retreat selected by the Idrisi is Zebid m the Tihama. 3. The position with regard to Najran is not so clear. Ibn baud, -buacl ±5ey informed me, had emphasised to the Imam the tendency of the tribes m Najran to look more towards Nejd than to the Yemen of recent years but, for the sake of a peaceful settlement, declared himself ready so far to sacrifice his own interests ” as to agree to the neutralisation of this territory as it was m foimei years. He was prepared to agree with the Imam that neither should send 0 ^ es into Najran except for the maintenance of law and order, and^ then only after consultation and upon mutual agreement This was the King s la st w° r d on this point. The Imam’s reply consisted of a statement to the eftect that the presence of his own troops in this province was due solely to his desire to preserve security; and since then, Fuad Bey continued, the Saudi Arab Government had received information that the Imamic forces were withdrawing from Najran, having burned and razed to the ground the township of Badr, the religious centre of the g Makrami sect, on evacuating it Fuad Bey stated that the Yemeni ti oops were now being concentrated on the Asir frontier at Medi Haradh Saada and a fourth place, whose name was unknown to him, between Haradh and baada. 4. So much for the present diplomatic phase. To judge from the statements of Fuad Bey Hamza, upon which the above account is based, the atmosphere m this dispute would now appear to be less highly charged Militarily, the situa ion has undergone no material change. Bemforcements and supplies continue to flow south but in a somewhat slower stream; and reports of road-makmg along the stony’road to Abha from Mecca, to vary the story of warlike also been received. The frontier was quiet, according to Fuad Bey but there had been cases of individual desertions to the Imam of tribesmen m Asir, chiefly o th6 ^Ghe general situation, therefore, has every appearance of having taken a turn for th! better, but that this view is not shared by others m a position to form a considered opinion was illustrated by the report contained m my telegram No 219 of the 12th that war with the Yemen was now imminent and that the King was proceeding to Asir to take command m person of the Saudi army therf Thekeport reached me, through a trusted intermediary from the person mentioned in yok despatch No. 263 Sf the 5th October last; but, although this individual is normally well-informed, having as you !d°*km circles the story is so much at variance with the latest news gatnered non Euad Bey, that I feel constrained to await further confirmation. My informant [6 c—4]is again in Mecca and so temporarily inaccessible, but should there be any truth in his surprising message, the news must very soon become public property. I am, at the moment, strongly sceptical. , 6.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 389j3f to-day’s date, I have the honoui to transmit herewith translations of three notes verbales^) from the Italian Government on the subject of the situation in South-West Arabia, together with a translation of a personal letter from Signor Suvich to myself which accompanied these notes. . . . , r 2. It is evident from the tone of this last communication that the Italian Government attach real importance to the projected discussions in Rome; and for that reason, if for no other, I hope that it will be possible for a member oi your Department to come out here as soon as is convenient. From the lirst two notes you will observe that the Italian Government are anxious to justify their own attitude in regard to Asir; and no doubt they still have hopes of influencing in some degree that of His Majesty’s Government. In effect, however, they have agreed to conversations in full realisation of the latter s attitude, a] Af they cannot complain if His Majesty’s Government eventually fail to modify it. Their arguments, however, are moderately set forth, and will no doubt receive the examination which they merit. 3 I reoret that the Italian Government should have thought it necessary to send the third note verbale at all; but it should be remembered that they have throughout maintained that (in their view) it is impossible for British policy to be conducted in watertight compartments. _ « . at ooq r 4 I should perhaps add that the substance of Jedda telegram No. 223 of the 26th December and the gist of No. 226 of the 29th December were conveyed to the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs. As regards the latter telegram it was merely stated that, according to the Saudi Government agreement seemed to be in sight on all the major points (including Asir), with the exception of Neiran. Signor Guarnaschelli, to whom this information was given, expressed pleasure and relief at the progress made, which, he seemed to infer, implied that Ibn Saud had, in fact, consented to “ negotiate m regard to Asir. He added that he would try to obtain confirmation of the progress made from Sanaa. , I have, &amp;c. ERIC DRUMMOND. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. M. Suvich to Sir E. Drummond. (Translation.) My las ’ t f ew W eeks we have had occasion to consider the situation in Arabia- the Ministry has been in contact on this subject with the Embassy, and your Excellency has forwarded certain notes regarding the various aspects of ^ Ration ^itself.^ ^ to ^ noteS; which I have preferred to submit together given the connexion between them, and after having given my own partfcuta aftention to the question, both in its present phase and m its PreC BesWe P s h the eS events which are now taking place in Arabia the fundamental fact which underlies these notes is formed, as you know, by the conclusions of [6 b—2] P) Not printed. Bthe Rome conversations of 1927, and represents one of the aspects of Anglo- Italian collaboration after the war, and one which is both interesting and fruitful, seeing that it has certainly contributed to the maintenance of peace between the States of the Arabian Peninsula. It is hardly necessary that I should draw your attention to the contents of the attached notes, and that I should request you to be so good as to draw the attention of your Government to them. I am also happy to inform you that I do so at the instance of his Excellenc, the head of the Government, with the request that you should be so good as to interest the Prime Minister, Mr. MacDonald, in the question. At this moment, in which our two Governments are bound in the interests of peace to continue their common work for the best solution of the problems and questions which concern Europe, and one may say the whole world, the Italian Government desires to express the hope that such collaboration and understanding may also continue in regard to the problems of the Arabian Peninsula, a result which could, not fail to have the most favourable influence on the pacification of this district, and, in general, a favourable repercussion on the whole work of Anglo-Italian collaboration. Accept, &amp;c. QTrvrrnrT Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Note Verbale from Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs. (Translation.) THE Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs has the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the notes verbales of the British Embassy Nos. 35t) and 365 of the 20th and 26th October last, and of No. 372 of the 7th November, as well as the receipt of the aide-memoire of the 30th October and the 17th November last, and with reference to their contents and (with reference) at the same time to the Ministry’s preceding notes verbales on the question and, in particular, to No. 228396/118 of the 21st September last, have the honour to make the following communication 2. According to the British Embassy's note verbale No. 350 of the 20th October last, the British Government considers that its own position in regard to the sovereignty over Asir is determined by the fact that in 1931 it entered into relations with the Hejaz Government regarding communications between certain localities under British administration and the port of Jizan. In this regard note No. 350 of the British Embassy refers to a preceding note verbale No. 296 of the 24th July, 1931. The same British note No. 350 adds that such action on the part of the British Government constituted an informal admission of the rights of Ibn Saud over this province, though, in order to meet the point of view of the Italian Government, the British Government deferred any direct and formal manifestation of its recognition of the sovereignty of the Saudi King over Asir. It further asserts that the British Government holds, so far as it is concerned, that this sovereignty is valid de facto and de jure. Since reference was made to the preceding exchange of notes in 1931, the Italian Government considers it opportune to resume as follows the contents of these notes :— In its aide-memoire of the 30th May, 1931, the British Embassy informed the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the London Government had received a note from the Hejaz Government in which the latter requested British acquiescence in what, according to the point of view of the latter, should be considered as the de facto and de jure status of Asir, and that in these circum stances the British Government had the intention of recognising the absorption of Asir on the part of the Hejaz, but that, before doing so, it desired to receive the observations of the Italian Government. The Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs’ reply was a detailed note verbale of the 25th June, 1931, in which it referred to the discussion of the Asir question which took place during the Rome conversations of 1927, and concluded byexpressing the hope that the British Government would find it convenient not to proceed with the demanded recognition in the interests of the maintenance of peace in the Arabian peninsula. The British Embassy made it clear in its note verbale of the 24th July, 1931, that the communication of the Hejaz Government did not demand a formal expression of recognition of the incorporation of Asir in the dominions of '-Jbn Saud, but only the conclusion of agreements for laying down the methods of communication in certain localities under British administration and the ports of Jizan and Asir. It added that the British Government, in order to meet the views of the Italian Government, agreed to put off all formal and direct expression of recognition of the sovereignty of Ibn Saud over Asir, although it remained of opinion that Asir had become de facto and de jure an integral part of the Saudi provinces. The Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs, in its note verbale of the 13th August, 1931, took note that no demand for formal recognition of the sovereignty of Ibn Saud over Asir had been put forward by the Hejaz Govern ment to the London Government, and noted with pleasure that the British and Italian Governments were agreed in the determination to put off all formal and direct expression of recognition of the sovereignty of Ibn Saud over Asir. The statement made in the British note No. 350 of the 20th October, that the London Government considers that the question of the sovereignty over Asir is determined by the fact that in 1931 they entered into correspondence with the Hejaz Government with regard to the method of communication between certain localities under British administration and the port of Jizan, and that such a fact constitutes an informal admission on the British side of the rights of Ibn Saud over Asir, represents a new statement which seems to go beyond the idea expressed in the British note of the 24th July, 1931. Tfi e establishment o such communications is a simple fact which, in the opinion of the Italian Government, does not in itself imply any admission, even informal, of the rights of Ibn Saud over Asir; still less would it seem to have as a consequence the determination of the position of the British Government in regard to the question of the sovereignty over Asir. . . a The Italian Government points out in this connexion that, as was mentioned in note verbale of the 25th June, 1931, the representatives of the British Govern ment during the conversations at Rome declared that all territorial questions in regard to Asir, and in general in regard to the frontiers between the Hejaz and the Yemen, were regarded as an internal Arabian question which did not interest the British Government. ., . • * So far as it is concerned, the Royal Government considers the question of Asir as still open between the Hejaz-Nejd and the Yemen; and basing itself on the spirit of the conclusions of the Rome conversations, holds that it should not in any case commit itself in regard to a dispute between the two Arab btates. Recalling in particular that the original cause of this dispute is the suppression carried out by Ibn Saud of the buffer State, the existence of which was considered necessary in the Rome conversations m order to avoid acute friction between the two Arab States, the Royal Government trusts that the British Government will uphold its own determination to avoid any foimal and direct recognition of the sovereignty of Ibn Saud over Asir, and will also abstain generally from committing itself in regard to the dispute which separates the two States. 3. Having thus explained the point of view of the Italian Government m regard to Asir it is now necessary to consider the action which has been or wi betaken by the British and Italian Governments with a view to preventing an nvmpfl ponflict between the two Arab States. The Royal Government, for its part, has not failed to exercise all possi e influence on the Imam with a view to avoid the outbreak of hostilities; it considers so far as it is concerned, that it has attained its end, seeing that m spite rtt^ntkuous vLrations, from 1926 to the present time on the paid of Ibn Saud of the de facto and de jure status in Asir—a province over which the imam claims and maintains his well-known rights-it has “which hTtS Tla^ nart of the Imam himself, a reaction greater than that which has taken place, and which has been limited to verbal protests and to categorical reaffirmations ° f ‘ WithTS toThe Sfalogoim action to be exercised in regard to Ibn Saud the Italian Government, with reference to what was said m the first part of [6 b—2] B4 paragraph 5 of note No. 350 of the British Embassy, is perfectly aware of the difference existing in the situation in which the British Grovernment found itself in regard to the dispute between Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah. However, if the British Grovernment is not in a position to exeicise its influence on both parties, the possibility exists that such influence might be exei cised m a parallel manner on Ibn Saud and on the Imam. In effect and in the same way as the pressure exercised on the Imam b- the Italian Government, the British Government has renewed its pressure on Ibn Saud as is shown bv note verbale No. 265 of the 26th October last, and by the aide-mdmoire of the 30th October, and by the note verbale No. 372 of 7th November. , , , t 4. The Royal Government holds that parallel hnghsh and Italian action on the Imam and on Ibn Saud should continue to be exercised with a, view to avoiding the further deterioration of the grave political situation existing to-day in the Arabian Peninsula, and the interruption of the direct relations which still exist between Ibn Saud and the Imam resulting in armed conflict between the two States. . . ... 5. The Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs notes with interest what the British Embassy communicated in their note verbale No. 372 of the 7th November last regarding the attitude of Ibn Saud and his point of view in regard to the existing disputes with the Imam. From this communication it results that the principal objects of Ibn Saud are to assure— (a) The recall of the forces of the Imam from the de facto frontier existing before the outbreak of the present conflict (Ibn Saud evidently refers to the occupation on the part of the Imam of the territory of Nejran). (b) An agreed delimitation of this frontier. (c) The confirmation of preceding agreements. While not wishing to discuss the merits of the Saudi point of view, the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs cannot refrain from observing that, while it does not appear that the occupation of the territory of Nejran by the Imam violated any existing rights of the Saudi Kingdom, no statement was made by Ibn Saud regarding the territory of Asir, which he evidently considers as an integral part of his kingdom, but which, in fact, constitutes the principal subject of dispute between Ibn Saud and the Imam. It is, indeed, a positive fact, in regard to which, in spite of the uncertainty of the available evidence (“ Fincertezza degli elementi disponibili ”) that it was Ibn Saud who changed the de facto and de jure situation existing in Asir by annexing it definitely to the Saudi Kingdom. 6. The Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs is replying separately to the note verbale of the British Embassy No. 384 of the 20th November last. Rome, December 1933 (XII). Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Note verbale from the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs. (Translation.) THE Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of note verbale No. 384 of the 20th November last, in which the British Embassy informed them that the London Government, appreciating the desire of the Italian Government to eliminate all possible points of friction between the two Governments and to co-operate in assuring the re-establishment of pacific relations in South-West Arabia, accepts the proposal of the Italian Government to hold a meeting of experts in Rome, but adds at the same time that it desires to know in advance more precisely the proposals and, if possible, the programme which the Italian Government has in mind. It adds that the London Government is, for its part, forced to state that it is not in a positionr~ o mm tlv Ion ■nnieiit, { blepo# »*Si tis to modify its attitude in regard to the sovereignty of Ibn Sand over Asir proper, that is to say, over that territory at least over which the Idrisi exercised his own sovereignty at the time of the Treaty of Mecca in 1926, and that it would be ready to elaborate the juridical reasons on which its attitude was based. It further asserts that there is no question of proposals intended to modify the conclusions of the conversations of Rome in 1927, which still, according to the jipint of view of the British Government, form the basis of the Anglo-Italian Nations in Arabian and Red Sea questions. The Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs, while thanking the British Embassy for its courteous communication, has the honour to inform it that the Italian Government is grateful to the British Government for having promptly accepted the Italian proposals for a meeting of experts in Rome. With regard to the request for explanations made by the British Embassy as to the proposals and the programme which the Royal Government have in mind to lay before the projected meeting, the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs has the honour to state that, as the Director-General of Political Affairs had already had occasion to communicate to the counsellor of the British Embassy on the 2nd November last, the meetings between the Italian and British experts should have for object the joint examination, on the basis of the conclusions of the conversations of Rome in 1927—which, in the opinion of the Royal Govern ment, also constitute the basis of the Anglo-Italian relations in Arabian and Red Sea matters—and in the interests of the maintenance of peace in the Arabian peninsula and of friendly co-operation between the two Governments, of the events which have since taken place and the situation which has developed in those regions. 3. It is precisely because the Italian Government completely agrees with the British Government in holding that the conclusions of the conversations in Rome should constitute the basis of Anglo-Italian relations in all Arabian and Red Sea questions, and hence should be the starting-point of the projected meeting of experts, that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs cannot avoid being rather preoccupied in regard to the statement contained in the note verbals under reply, according to which the British Government could not abandon the attitude assumed by them in regard to the sovereignty of Ibn Sand over Asir. 4. It should, in fact, be remembered that, as the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has already had occasion to explain in detail to the British Embassy in its preceding notes verbales (see, for example, note verbale No. 222751/91 of the 25th June, 1931), the Treaty of Mecca of 1926, by which Ibn Sand set up his own protectorate over Asir, was the subject of discussion during the conversations at Rome in 1927; and in regard to it the British delegates, after having demanded and received instructions from the London Government, declared that the British Government could not have refused a Hejazi demand for the recognition of the Treaty of 1926, seeing that it was about to conclude with the Hejaz a Treaty of Friendship, and a refusal would have compromised the conclusion of this treaty (the treaty was afterwards concluded in 1927, although the British Government continued in its non-recognition of the situation created by Ibn Sand in Asir), but that, in any case, the British representatives, in the name of their Government, declared that all territorial questions, such as those of Asir, were regarded as an internal Arabian question and did not interest the London Government. It is further noted that the record of the Rome conversations expressly consider Asir as the State existing in the Arabian Peninsula in regard to wh^l the possibility was foreseen of taking the action contemplated in paragraph 2 oj the conclusions themselves. 5. The statement mentioned in the note of the British Embassy No. 384 of the 20th November last, according to which the London Government desire to make it clear even before the opening of the proposed conversations between experts, that they are not in a position to depart from the attitude adopted by them regarding the sovereignty of Ibn Saud over Asir, deserves to be explained in relation to the assurances given in the course of the Rome conversations regarding British disinterestedness in territorial questions regarded as internal Arabian questions, if only to give rise in the proposed meeting of experts to a useful examination of the new situation created by Ibn Saud in Asir, which constitutes the principal modification of the political situation existing in the Arabian Peninsula at the time of the Rome conversations of 1927, and forms at present the principal reason for the existing tension between the Hejaz-Nejd and the Yemen. a * Tip oOtXust, i /w&lt;«, ^ r&lt;***~J&amp; Jft Thp TJoval Ministry for Foreign Affairs, while drawing the attention of th, British Embassy to the' above considerations, has the honour to confirm that it is ready for its part to begin the proposed conversations on the basis of the 1 w fn in 1927 in order to examine the events which have taken place “ntThe°n a“d th “tS^which has developed in Arabia (thus including the smce men, a u ^ ^ m regard to Asir ) m t h e interests of peace in that region and of the friendly co-operation between the British ar' Italian Governments. n Th „ nnrmho'T OQ 1 ( X 1 I h• 59 o SO/2/%5 } otock, n. v M« “ 15 th 1954o 6 i ') J93 •aw* vfts WMNMtofek.

No 0 9 Your telegram No * 10 I still think representations are most unlikely to affect course of events and I still fear that if made officially they may expose His Majesty's Government to suspicion of trying to save Imam from consequences of attitude which Ihn Saud considers aggressive and equivocal. Danger of such suspicion arises not only from constant repetition of our earlier counsels of moderation hut from specific causes including refusal to assist last summer, despatch of British mission to Sana, and insistence latterly on settlement of debts to His Majesty’s Government, although in all these cases except possibly the last, action of His Majesty's Government was such, as Saudi Government might oe expected to understand, I nevertheless see Sir Bn Drummond's difficulty and I consider developments since December 15th give us an opportunity of going even further than he suggests to meet it 0 In view of these developmenus I couid now make a communication on the following lines without I think unduly stimulating suspicion mentioned above, provided I were authorised to embody it in a personal letter .., 11 X I _ * A 1 rJ letter to Fuad, rather than in an oifieial note. Pis Majesty's Government learnt on January 13uh that Jeilly had just urged on the 1mm, not ror mho first tine, desirability of a friendly settlement, and was told that negotiations between him and Ton Baud were progressing. This seemed to tally with Fuad’s language on January 9th even though question of Najran still presented difficulty, and he stated on January 16th that position had not changed. In those circum stances His Majesty’s Government, whose only object is to promote peace and stability in Arabia, are Perturbed to learn from the press that, in consequence of some local disturbance, the heir apparent had been ordered to the front before arrival of a telegram despatched by the Imam on January 9th, and that Commander-in-chief in Asir had also been instructed to advance. Although it is stated that the latter advance has been counter manded, His Majesty’s Government cannot but fear there is a serious danger of outbreak of hostilities as a result of mere misunderstanding on each side as to intentions of the other. They earnestly hope un,m Saudi Government, who have given so many proors of their desire for peace, will do their utmost to avert so irreparable a misfortune. They request Ministry of Foreign Affairs to convey this message to the King, with assurance that it is inspired by friendliest disposi tions to a ruler who has constantly shown his confidence ^ SiJ&amp;ISdtfSAsTo iSMTJMSie tl0 “ MSSSsSSd”o t F“eten 1 Qffice, repeated to Bone Ko.4.Similar letter sent to ^ r 14—6130 8931 (2) ^ In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. £ bu s “\ Os, s L * • and address —not to any person by nhme, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

Following frcm Colonel Reilly. Begins. Under your instructions I have several times expressed the hope that the Imam will reach peaceful settlement with Ibn Saud, and the Foreign Minister Ragheb Bey stated yesterday that telegraphic negotiations between them are progressing. He did not give details but I hear from separate source that it is proposed that the Imam should evacuate Nejran where Yemen troops have lately suffered defeats by Beni Yam on the understanding that it will remain neutral territory, and that Ibn Saud should evacuate Beni Malek on similar condition, final definition of the whole frontier being left for future decision as in proposed Anglo-Yemen Treaty. Position of the Anglo-Yemen negotiations is not as satisfactory as it was. Treaty terms have been agreed and the Imam has repeated his willingness to fulfil the conditions of the admonitory document but he is questioning correctness of line to which British ultimatum of October last compelled him to retire in Western Subeihi area alleging incorrectly that it differs from the old Anglo-TurMsh Boundary. He also disputes the justice of our inclusion of Masabis in district covdred by our Treaty with Behhan. I am insisting on maintenance of present/present position along the whole frontier with the exceptions of Audhali country and Sanah area.In any further communication on this subject, please quote no. 1. rts. and address —not to any person by ndme, but tto— The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

Fuad stated on January 9th that the situation was still uncertain,, He said that war had seemed imminent some days before lut that the King had made a fresh effort for peace by suggesting postponement of discussion about Najran until a meeting of delegates to reduce to writing agreement reached on other points. Although Fuad complained of impossibility of getting straight answer from Imam about anything, he conveyed the impression that' the King was still genuinely eager for peace. During the last three days however I have been hearing from various quarters of intense military activity at Taif and elsew hergp The situation at Taif which the Amir Feisal visited at short / notice about January 6th is obscured by reports of disaffection amongst the Ateyba. Troops numbering several hundreds have embarked in Besse steamer for Jizan today. Every sort of rumour is current. I cannot judge outlook with confidence but it is quite possible that Ibn Baud is only awaiting end of Ramazan to launch attack, festival begins on January 17th. Having regard to recent course of events I have become doubt-, ful as to expediency of representations contemolated .in corres \ pondence ending with your telegram No. 154. If Ihn Saud has decided \to fight after putting himself in a position to say diai. he ha. done everything possible to avoid it no representations o will stop him ana we may merely incur suspicion of secret sympathy with Imam.

I have already reported in my telegrams Nos. 193, 196 and 201 ot the 13th, 15th and 22nd November respectively that Amir Feisal and Fuad Bey Hamza have similarly contradicted to me reports of the infraction by Saudi forces of the southern frontier of Asir in the neighbourhood of Medi. Hostilities, of course, still continue in Najran between certain elements of the Beni Yani and the Imamic forces, the most recent development in that area, accoiding to Fuad Bey Hamza, being the defeat of the Yemenis at Wadi Habuna, south-east of Badr by a section of the Beni Yam under one Husayn-bm-Jabir (or Jabir-bin- Husayn), and the occupation of the valley by the tribe. Badr, Fuad Bey confirmed, was still in the hands of the Imam Yahya’s men. , 3 I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosure to His Majesty s Ambassador, Rome, His Majesty’s High Commissioners for Egypt and Trans jordan, His Majesty’s Chief Commissioner, Aden, and to the senior naval officer, Red Sea Sloops. . „ I have, &amp;c.

Asir for further reasons which are given in detail is included amongst such events.

He stated that agreement had been reached on the following points. 1. Idrisi to be removed to Zebid, 2c Imam to recognise existing position in regard to both parts of Asire Parties to make treaty affirming this. It would resemble projected Angio-Yemen treaty inasmuch as it would be concluded for 20 years but according to luad it would preclude Imam from contesting Ibn Saud's rights in Asir at any iuture time.

This leaves question of Uajran unsettled Fuad defined Saudi proposal in language similar to that reported in my telegram Lo. 217.

Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman went on to refer to Saudi preparations in Asir as being now practically complete. Units of the forces under the command of Amir Feisal-bin-Saud were now disposed somewhat nearer to the frontier with the Yemen, and he considered they would be readily available should they be called upon to resist a sudden incursion into Asir by Imamic troops. The Commander- in-chief still had his headquarters at Abha, in the vicinity of which the major part of the Saudi army was centred. He was accompanied by a mobile wireless set and was in constant touch with Ibn Sand, who was, of course, similarly equipped. There was also a wireless set at Jizan, probably in addition to the wireless station known to have been established there by Marconi (Limited), as Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman stated that the set at Abha and that at Jizan were the two portable sets presented to Ibn Saud by Sir Francis Humphrys in 1930. 3. Saudi military authorities have also had their resources m respect of communications considerably augmented recently by the arrival at Jedda towards the end of October of two large motor launches. These, named the Ne]d and the Riyadh, were purchased by Ibn Saud at Bahrein and made the \oyage undei theii own power They were at once put into commission for the transport of troops and left for Jizan on the 1st November, carrying a number of soldiers estimated cit 500 4. No ultimatum, such as was foreseen by the Minister of Finance has yet, as far as I am aware, been sent by the King to the Imam. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman was unable to inform me whether, if an ultimatum were issued, it would at once be published or become generally known, but, as I have reported m my telegram No. 183, he spontaneously promised to inform me privately as soon as he himself had hews of its issue. ^ nvr • x &gt;-«\ In any further communication on this subject, please quote no.

With reference to my secret despatch Circular A*No.73, of the 11th May 1932, I have the honour to state that, as a result of further correspondence with the Imam of the Yemen, it has been decided that there is sufficient prospect of agreement to justify a visit from the Resident at Aden to Sanaa with the object of concluding a treaty with trie Imam, and he has accordingly been instructed to address to the Imam a communication to the effect tnat he is prepay eu. # subject to certain conditions, to proceeu to Sanaa to coaclud a treaty when the Imam will receive him* 2* It may be convenient at this stage to give a brief history of the relations of His Majesty^ Government in the United Kingdom with the Imam since the termination of the War. \ 3. The Imam of the Yemen is the head oi the Eeidi sect of Islam and the ruler of a large territory in south west Arabia immediately north of the Aden irotectorate* The Yemen was under the Turks from 1871 to 1918, and in 1903-05/1903-05 the ‘boundary between the Aden Protectorate and the Yemen was delineated with the Turks in a aeries of agreements, which, in 1914, were combined in one convention* At the ena of the War in 1918, Turkish forces were still in occupation of parts of the Aden Protectorate. They were never ejecteu by force, but were negotiated out after the armistice, and their place in the Yemen a as taken by the Imam. 4. The Imam has consistently refused to recognise the Anglo-Turkish boundary, ana in 1919 he commenced his encroachments into the Aden Pro wectorate, taking Dhala* In 1924 Zeidi tribes occupied the upper country of the ^ Audhali tribe (which is under British protection by virtue of a treaty signed in 1914), and invadea the lower Audhali country in 1925. The Imam’s forces immediately dislodged from the lower country by air action, but efforts to recover the upper part were unsuccessful. This failure was due partly to a lack of co-operation on the part of the Audhalis themselves,and '' v \ partly to the inadequate air itrces then available at Aden. 5. Hostilities were suspenfea in 1926 and the lefce Sir Gilbert Clayton was sent to Sanaa (the Imam’s capital), where he endeavoured to negotiate a treaty with the Imam, but the negotiations broke down on the question of evacuation of the occupied Protectorate Territory* 6* Early in 1927 a serious warning was given to the Imam, through the Resident at Aden, that his occupation/9 ./ to I.F.S.only) . 11 * occupation oi part or t he Aden i rotectorate rendered him liable at any time to such measures oi’ retaliation by land, air or sea, at such time and in such manner as His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom might deem suitable* The j. mam 9 s reply to this warning was pacific, and included an offer to resume negotiations lor a treaty. It was eventually decided to pursue the method of negotiation, but to make the evacuation of the occupied Protectorate territory a pre-requisite to the signing of any treaty. T. In spite of this decision, it was found necessary in 1938 to take air action against the Imam in the Dhala area as a result of the kidnapping of two Protectorate Sheikhs by Zeidi forces. Various town in Yemen territory were bombed, as also were the 1 rentier garrisons; the Protectorate tribes assisted, and in two months the whole ol the Dhala area was evacuated by the Heidis except for a small piece of territory in the vicinity of Sanaa (see my predecessor 5 s telegram \ Circular B.No.28 of the 14th April 1928)* of which a copy was enclosed in his secret despatch of the 16th April 1928). 8. Small incursions have occurred at other points, e.g. the A1 Ain area in the North-east of the Protectorate, when a threat of bombing was resorted to, ana this proved sufficient to induce the Zeldi forces to withdraw.4 * \. 9. Recently, this year, a Xurther incursion was made into the Subeihi territory in the south west corner of the Aden Protectorate by £eidi troops and Yemeni tribesmen, and a number of prisoners, sheep and camels seized. As a result, however, of the delivery of an ultimatum threatening air action, satisfactory restitut- jcn has been made and the Bubeihi territory evacuated* 10* dince 19^5 the policy of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom has therefore been that, apart from further incursions into Protectorate 'j territory or any other provocation by the Imam, such as Interference with Protectorate tribesmen, evacuation of the occupied Protectorate territory should be secured by negotiation. They have, however, always insisted that the signature of the treaty must be preceded by three things, namely;- (a) the evacuation of occupied Protectorate territory; (b) the release of a number of Protectorate tribesmen who were captured in the Audhali country and are still prisoners with the Imam; and (c) the removal or the embax^go which the Imam has, since 1962, placed on trauc between the Yemen and the Protectorate. The Imam has now in effect expressed his willingness to carry out these three conditions, if a treaty is concluded* 11* The chief obstacles to the conclusion of the treaty have been:-(a) the consistent attempt of the Imam to introduce into the text some rorm of wording which will enable him to claim at least some portion of the Aden Protectorate (if not the whole, including Aden itself) as part of his ancestral domain; (b) his claim to sovereignty over certain islands in the Red Sea» The Imam* s claim to portins of the Aden Protectorate is not admitted, while the sovereignty of the Red Sea islands, which raises international questions under the Treaty of Lausanne, is not within the competence of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to decide. With regard to the latter question, however, the Imam has now been informed that '*His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will be ready to bear in mind any views he may wish to put forward with regard to the islands at the southern end of the Red Sea referred to in Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne, if at any time the status of these islands is under considerati on t? • 12 . While efforts to reach a basis for the conclusion of a treaty with the Imam have made progress, the position has lately been complicated by a serious deterioration, which might at any time lead to hostilities, in the relations between Ibn Baud ana the Imam. The chief points at issue between these two rulers concern Asir, which lies between the Hejaz on ^ the north and the Yemen on the south, and Mejran, which is/6 * (to 1-4) (to 5) (all) is a vaguely defined region to the east of Aeir. The ruler of Asir, the head oi the Idrisi family, accepted in 1926 (see my predecessor’s telegram oi the 2nd February 1926) (see my predecessor’s secret despatch of the 2nd February 1926) the suzerainty of Ibn Saud, who assumed control of foreign affairs and finance but left to the Idrisi the conduct of the internal administration: in 1930 the Idrisi by a further agreement with Xbn Saud in effect accented the complete incorporation of Asir into Ibn Saud*s territories, retaining himself a merely nominal position* The Imam, on the other hand, has since long before these events, maintained a claim to at least the 'southern part of Asir* In the winter of 1932-3 the Idrisi rebelled, as a result, it is believed, of disputes with the Saudi Governor* of Asir* The Imam was supected of covertly assisting the rebels, but outwardly maintained a correct and even conciliatory attitude* The rebellion was finally suppressed in the spring of 1933 and the Idrisi took refuge in the Yemen; Ibn Baud consenting after discussion with the imam to allow the Idrisi to remain there and to give him a pension* The immediate cause of the present crisis seems to have been a Yemeni invasion of iiejran, which began in June last* The political allegiance of the Nejran tribes is uncertain but Ibn Saud claims, and the Imam denies,that an oral agreement was reached between them in 1927 in respect of this region* Yemeni penetration of Nejran continued/8 . use their influence with the Imam, Idrisi and Ibn Saud with a view to eliminating causes of conflict between those Chiefs, but that they would not intervene in any conflict which night break out between them. To this end Hia Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have throughout the present crisis used their influence to urge counsels of moderation on Ibn Saud and the Italian Government have undertaken to act in a similar sense at Sanaa. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have had to consider the question of treaty negotiations with the Imam in the light of the 1927 arrangement, ana in particular in the light of the possibility that the visit of the Resident at Aden to Sanaa, if hostilities were to break out between the Imam and Ibn Saud, might on the one hand be taken by Ibn Saud to indicate sympathy vrith the cause of the Imam, and on the other might confirm Italian suspicions that advantage was being taken of the Imam’s difficulties* Instructions have accordingly been issued to His Majesty’s Representatives concerned to acquaint the Italian Government and Ibn Saud with the true position and to assure them at the same time that, although the visit of the Resident will have no direct connection with the Saudi-Yemeni conflict, he will use his best efforts when at Sanaa to prevent an outbreak of hostilities if they still threaten* 14* The crisis between Ibn Saud and the Imam has been continuously discussed with tte Italian Government as it developed. An incidental result of these discussions has been to accentuate the existing difference Of/ yof view between the two Governments in regard to the status of Asir# It was decided by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, in 1931, as a result of an examination of the point, that since the Idrisi, as an indepenuent ruler, was perfectly entitled to make over his territories to Ibn Saud, if he desired to do so, Asir must be regarded as having become ae facto and de jure an integral part of Ibn Baud’s dominions* In deference, however, to the views of the Italian Government, who did not recognise Ibn Baud’s position in Asir and endeavoured to persuade His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom not to do so, no formal intimation of their recognition of that position has been made by the United Kingdom to the Saudi Arabian Government, although correspondence has been conducted with them on matters connected with Asir* During the present crisis the Italian Government have suggested that the decision of the United Kingdom Government as to Ibn Baud’s sovereignty over Asir should be reconsidered but it is being made clear to them that, at any I'ato so far as concerns the area over which the Idrisi held sovereignty at the time of his treaty ol 19B6 with Ibn Saud, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom cannot depart from their previous attitude* 15. The Italian Government have suggested that the whole situation in Arabia should be discussed on the basis of the 1927 conversations (see my telegram despatch referred to in paragraph 13 above), and a reply has been sent to the effect that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are prepared to agree, but they would welcome further information as to the ixjints to be discussed,/10 . discussed, and assume that the conclusions 01 * the Home conversations of 1937 are to remain unaffected. The reply restates the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom regarding Asir as outlined in the preceding paragraph. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) J.H.

Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—{Received December 5.) g^ 0 ^ Jedda, November 14, 1933. ’ WITH reference to my despatch N o. 328 and my telegrams Nos. 190 and 193_ of the 7th, 12th and 12th November, respectively, regarding the present dispute between Ibn Sand and the Imam Yahya of the Yemen, I have the honour to report more fully than was possible in my telegrams under reference my conversation of the 12th November with Fuad Bey Hamza in so far as it concerned the present situation of tension between the two countries. The meeting was the first I had been able to have with the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs since his return from abroad, owing to his somewhat prolonged absence in Riyadh, as I have reported to you elsewhere. . 2. Fuad Bey Hamza explained that he had gone to Riyadh immediately upon his return to this country in order to consult Ibn Sand in regard to the baudi- Yemen situation, to bring his own information on the subject up to date and to acquaint himself with what he termed the c ‘ inside of the question. He was cognisant of the communications which had already passed between Ibn baud and His Majesty’s Government through Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman and this Legation, and said that it was the King himself who was dealing with all matters relating to the present situation, as all papers were at once passed on to Riyadh by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, copies only being retained by the Ministry at Mecca. It was a case, therefore, of the two rulers, rather than their Governments, being m direct control of this delicate situation. a u^ n c 3 He informed me that since my last interview with Sheikn Abduilan Suleiman there had been certain further developments of importance. On the 8th November Ibn Baud had received (probably by wireless) a communication from the Imam Yahya asking to be informed of the reason for the recent concentration of Saudi troops near the southern frontiers of Asir. Two days later the King had replied stating that the measures were purely precautionary and were a consequence of similar concentrations and other military activities which had for some time been steadily pressed forward on the Yemeni side of the border. I he King had again emphasised, according to Fuad Bey Hamza, his firm intention of avoiding any act of aggression, but maintained his resolve to defend the integrity of his territories. The King had also seized the opportunity presented by this renewal of correspondence with the Imam to include with his lep y a le oimu a tion of his demands, his four points (summarised m my telegram No 186), and Fuad Bey Hamza went on to describe the communication as being m the natme of an ultimatum. He represented the King’s demands as reasonable, for, said e as far as the Tihama was concerned, Ibn Baud would be justified from a lega point of view, in demanding the cession of more territory to the south than he was actually claiming. When Ibn Baud concluded his first treaty with the Idrisi some fourteen years ago, the latter’s seat of government was at Ho ei a, an e1 ^ oi y as far south as that port was then considered as the Idrisi sphere Ibn Baud however, was now contenting himself with that portion of Tihamat Asu as fa only as the present frontier. Surely this was reasonable. 1 4 As regarded the Idrisi himself, by the terms of the Saudi-Yemen Treaty of C£ Bon-Voisinage,” &amp;c., of December 1931, he should have been handed over to Ibn Baud by the Imam. The treaty provided for the extradition of all offenders, political as well as other, yet the Imam’s obligation m this respect had not been carried out. But Ibn Baud was magnanimously prepared not to insist on tffe surrender of the Idrisi (in deference to the traditional Arab custom m regard to asylum and sanctuary), provided that he was either expelled fiom e emen or, Fuad Bey Hamza gave me to understand, removed from the frontier zone to some place as, for example, Sana, where he would be out of haim s way. uie y is, too, was reasonable. [991 e—1] 737^'5. When the Deputy Minister stated that this ultimatum, or quasi ultimatum, had not been published, and that on the nature of the Imam’s reply would depend the King’s future course of action, I intervened, as described in my telegram No. 190, to inform him of my instructions in the event of the issue of an ultimatum. He thereupon endeavoured to define the nature of Ibn Baud’s communication to the Imam as a restatement of the Saudi case and an invitation to the Imam to give his views thereon. Although earlier in the conversation Fuaf Bey Hamza had stated that the King was well aware of Zeidi ambitions, both through the Imam’s statements to the last Saudi delegation to visit Sana and from inspired articles in the Arabic press of neighbouring countries, as well latterly as from the Yemen’s sole newspaper the Iman, I accepted his explanation and agreed to take no further action for the moment beyond acquainting you with these new developments. I might here say that I have since received information from a source which in the past has proved most reliable, a source, moreover, in touch with official circles, to the efiect that Ibn Sand’s latest communication was his ‘ £ last and decisive ' ’ message, and I may therefore have to address you again by telegraph in the course of the next few days in regard to the real nature of this ultimatum. 6. An ultimatum had been prepared, Fuad Bey Hamza continued, and would be issued, if necessity arose, together with a Green Book which would contain a complete statement of the Saudi case and which was now in the hands of the printers, in the course of ten or fourteen days. 7. He went on to speak of the situation should it unfortunately deteriorate into hostilities. Of the sympathy of His Majesty’s Government they had no doubt, but the Saudi Government would like to feel as assured of the attitude of the Italian Government. The latter were in treaty relations with Saudi Arabia and the Saudi Government were sincerely desirous that those relations should remain friendly, but they (the Italian Government) were also in treaty relations with the Imam, and should a conflict ensue, might be inclined to lend support to the Imam as the older friend. I pointed out that this doubt had been raised by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman several months ago, and expressed my conviction that the Italian Government’s attitude in the event of hostilities would be strictly correct. As far as the supply of arms by them to the Imam was concerned, I said, making use of an argument already used at the Foreign Office with Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, that the Italians were entitled to trade in munitions and, moreover, had been doing so for a considerable time before this crisis arose—a point Fuad Bey Hamza seemed to admit. As he pressed me to request His Majesty’s Government to favour his Government with their views, 1 promised to inform you that he had expressed these misgivings. He then asked me point-blank, as Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman had done (and reported in my telegram No. 184), who, in regard to the recent representations, had taken the initiative, His Majesty’s Government or the Italian Government ? I answered, as on the previous occasion, that, as far as I was aware, the demarche was the outcome of joint consultations. 8. The Deputy Minister went on to speak, feelingly, that counsels of modera tion should be offered to the other side rather than to Ibn Saud, whose patience and longanimity in dealing with so obstinate, perverse and fractious an individual as the Imam Yahya had won general recognition. Fie said that he had gathered from his recent visit to Riyadh that Ibn Saud was determined to avoid hostilities at all costs.” For one thing, were the King to ignore the numerous appeals he had received from Moslems in neighbouring countries, calling upon him to avoid a fratricidal Arab war, and to take the first step in a war with the Yemen, he would at once forfeit the sympathy of the whole Islamic world. For another, the cost of a war would prove disastrous and the financial situation of this country was bad enough as it was. But, Fuad Bey Hamza added, any attack on the honour of the country would be resisted by all the means in their power. He quoted the Arab proverb to the effect that if the only road that presents itself be a thorny one, then one is obliged to go that way. 9. He concluded by describing certain frontier intrigues which, he said, had been suitably dealt with, and denied, on my putting a question to him. that Saudi troops had crossed the frontier into the Yemen in the neighbourhood of Medi (as reported in my telegram No. 193V With regard to this denial, however, I am not altogether satisfied, for strong rumours are current, and are reported by the source I have referred to earlier in this despatch, that such an infraction of the frontier at that point by Saudi troops has actually occurred, and it is also said that seriousUltlUj e “ f ^; mi ^idiankJ' toy itries, UtlfN n i : ffiih cewilsit- g__^ mint fli Sty’s GofB® .tktasfe fighting is now in progress in the Tihama, whither a further 400-500 troops were sent from here (by sea to Jizan) yesterday. While I am not at the moment prepared to accept the latter report, the next day or two may witness the commencement of hostilities and a war may well be in full swing before the formal ultimatum, which Fuad Bey Hamza states is still up the Saudi sleeve, can be Hunched in accordance with the punctilio of more enlightened practice. 10.

As a result of further correspondence between King and Imam latter is disposed to give satisfaction over 'minor” point of the Idrisi who would be removed from the frontier area to either Sanaa or Zebid. fhere was a possibility of an understanding over lajran concerning which Ibn Saud has declared himself ready at the sacrifice of his own interests to recognise Hajran as neutral territory as it was formerly, the question of its status being left dormant and any action for maintenance of security being taken jointly by Imam and himself after consideration. This represents Ton Saud ? s 'last word' on this point. Imam has asserted that his incursion into Hajran was due to desire to restore law and order and Saudi Government understand that Imamie forces are now evacuating Hajran, Badr having been burnt and razed to the ground, and are concentrating at four points including Saada, Haradh and lledi. Imam however has not so far referred to other Saudi 'main' points. Tribes in Asir are still quiet though there have been a few cases of individual desertions due to years of Idrisi intrigue. Fuad also told Charge dAffaires confidentially upon instructions from Ton Saud that no had had further conversation with Italian Charge d f Affaires on Sid December. Latter had read to him statement from ItalianItalian (kwernment declaring that their policy throughout tb 3 world not least in Arabia was one of peace. They would not take steps to impose peace but they had used theix^ influence with Imam to present hostilities and they had his assurance that he desired amicable settlement. They considered their efforts with Imam had achieved their object and they had taken tills course in spite of difficulties over status of Asir.Ff'CLOSURE IN MIAL OFFICE . r&lt;^v Lw. t i ER DATED.

FiRhtinK reported to have UeMun from the Red Sea to HeJran (By wireless from Alexandria, December 1.) News about the situation in Arabia is, H usual, con tradictory. It is stated from Jedda that King Ibn Saud has officially denied the existence of a state of war between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. On the other hand, reports from Yemeni sources which have arrived here via Aden assert that the forces of the Imam Yahia tfUAKGs* a part of which have already subdued the frJi 'i—e in the Nejran area, have distinguished themselves in repelling an attack by Saudi troops on the port of Midi, an attack which is reported to have been carried out in considerable force. The Yemeni troops, under the command of Said Abdullah bin Uazir, are stated also to have surprised and captured a group of Hejazi troops in armoured cars* The same authority goes on to state that encounters are reported to be continuing along the whole length of the line from the Nejran area to the port of Midi. The Growth of the Wahabig.T/TXM^r It is not easy to get one’s bearings between the reports from these two sources. Nevertheless it looks as though it might be more or less to Ibn Baud’s interest to deny the existence of a state of war and to reaffirm his intention to seek a peaceful settlement of the present conflict, at any rate until the position of the Yemenis can be shown to be more favourable than it is at present; and naturally it lo to the interest of the Imam Yahia to emphasise any succe^^th he may obtain, even if they have only been obtained in minor encounters./encounters. Ihe impression exists, in Egyptian circles at any rate, that the state of tension has recently hecome more acute and that war is more likely than an agreement between King ibn Baud and the Imam fahia. The latter has during the last few years witnessed a gigantic development of the power of the Ifahabi ruler. Ibn laud who, when he was only seventeen, in 1901, succeeded in reconquering Riyadh from the highland Emir of the Jebel 3 ha mm ail, and in thus reestablishing the imamate of the Wahabi sect in Nejd, has always pursued the dream of reuniting the whole territory of Arabia under his sway, in 1913 he succeeded in occupying the territory of Hasa on the Persian Gulf between Hadramaut (siej- presumably the Trucial coast is meant”) and the British protectorate (sic)/* of Koweit^ In 19530 Ibn Baud i^LG-loud-ing hie Wahabis to the conquest of Upper Asir which i*ad-«boen rented from the Idrissi Emir. The following year it was the Emirate of the Jebel Shamaar to the north of Nejd which was absorbed after a brief campaign. 0^ The time was ripe for bet*'/greater conquest, that of the kingdom of the Hejaz ? whose ruler, Ali^ sun Hussein, the successor of Hussein himself, wno had abdicated and who had been allied with the English against the Turks during the World War, could boast a capital such as Mecca, the holy place of Islam. The conquest was swift and its repercussion immense. In 1925 Ibn Baud invaded Asir also and placed it under hia protectorate; in 1926 he proclaimed himself King of the Kejaz and Nejd. Last year he assumed the title of King of Saudi Arabia, a territory which now comprises the greater part of the Arabian peninsula., The Imam Yahia, King of the Yemen, the only Arabian state not subjected by Ibn Saud, foresees that sooner or later the Wahabi prince will seek to extend his dominions Southwards. The/The Yeai en, with its flourishin t i trade and its famous coffee plantations running from Hodeida to Mocha, might well round off the new Arabian empire. The Imam Yahia had annexed Hejran, the territory bordering on the south-eastern frontier of Mi'. Ihn Saud in his turn proclaimed its annexation sending troops to occupy it or to besiege it.

Section 1. [E 6861/759/25] No. 1. Sw E. Drummond to Sir John Simon.—(Received November 11). (No. 854.) Sir, Rome, November 8, 1933. ’ WITH reference to my telegram No. J321 of to-day’s date regarding the situation in Asir, I have the honour to inform you that I made the communication to the Italian Government based on your telegram N o. 352_i n the form of a note verbale, with the exception of the second half of the last sentence of paragraph 2 of your telegram under reference, the gist of which was conveyed to the head of the African Department verbally. 2. Signor Guarnaschelli said at once that if this last information was a reference to recent importations of Italian arms into the Yemen, he would not deny that shipments had taken place. The Imam had entered into negotiations for the purchase of arms with an Italian firm, and in view of the fact that Ibn Saud was arming heavily, the Italian Government had not thought that they could stand in his way. But they were not a party to the transaction. Their position was exactly the same as that of the British Government vis-d-vis the British firms from whom Ibn Saud had bought arms and the firm of Besse and Co. who had conveyed them to Asir. 3. The member of my staff who interviewed Signor Guarnaschelli said that as a matter of fact no rumours had reached him of recent acquisitions of Italian arms by the Imam, nor did he know whether Ibn feaud had purchased any Bi itish arms. He thanked Signor Guarnaschelli, however, for the information he had volunteered. . 4. From subsequent conversation it was evident that the Italian Government were inclined to be comforted by the latest communication of His Majesty s Government, and to read into it some prospect that Ibn Saud had abandoned, at any rate for the moment, his intention of sending in an ultimatum. The member of my staff accordinglv, in view of recent despatches and telegrams from Jedda, thought it best to sound a note of caution, and to suggest that the danger of the despatch of an ultimatum was by no means averted. It depended to a considerable extent on the behaviour of the Imam, who, Signor Guarnaschelli would observe, had just attacked Badr. Signor Guarnaschelli replied that he would, of course, get in touch with the Imam (owing to the changing of the Italian doctor at Sanaa this would take about four days) and again impress on him the desirability of resuming negotiations. The essential object was to get these started again. Once they were started, it was perhaps legitimate to hope that some definite agreement by consent might be reached. I have, &amp;c.

CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [E 6772/759/25] No. 1. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—(Received November 7.) (No. 322.) Jedda, October 24, 1933. WITH reference to my despatch No. 305 of the 3rd October, regarding the strained relations at present existing between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen I have the honour to inform yon that upon receipt of the Acting Ohiet Commissioner at Aden’s telegram of the 18th October to the Colonial Omce, reporting renewed fighting in Najran and the capture of Badr by Zeidi forces, I at once sought an interview with Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, who happened to be on a visit to Jedda, in order to obtain what further information on the situation he would be willing to impart. I took the step of approaching the Minister of Finance, notwithstanding the return of the Deputy Minister tor Foreign Affairs from abroad, owing to the latter’s absence in Biyadh, whence he was not expected to return for at least ten days and in view of the necessity as it seemed to me, of bringing my information, from Saudi source^ up to date as early as possible. I saw Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman on the 19th October, and reported to you the gist of his remarks in my telegram No 179 of the same date. 2. I opened the conversation by remarking that to judge from the exiguous information which had reached Jedda for some two or three weeks past there would appear to have been a lull in hostilities on the southern frontiers of Asir, but more recently I had received reports which went to show that there was now a renewal of activity, particularly in Najran. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman at first was inclined to repeat what has recently become rather a stock phrase hls &gt; that the situation remained unchanged and that no further reply had been received from the Imam Yahya to Ibn Sand’s last telegrams. He, however soon became more communicative and admitted that heavy fighting ha recen Y ^ place between the Beni Yam and Imamic forces m Najran, whither the Imam s eldest son, Saif-ul-Islam Ahmad, had returned to take command. He confirmed that Badr, a township which for so long has been on H e P 01 ^ of , the hands of the Imam, had at last fallen, but he implied that thls ha ^ 0C P^ r ^ d not so much as a result of fighting but through the local sub-tribe of the Beni Yam always an independent element in the tribe, throwing its lot m with the forces of the Imam The place had been occupied. ■-&gt; i 3 I next enquired whether Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman himself considered that this renewal of local hostilities signified that Yemeni preparations for more general operations were being pushed forward. He replied that the Imam was, in reality, short of men as he was unable to count 0I 7 „ ... ganged ’’from the districts his forces had occupied, and that * r .°°P, s J! e [® few in number. He added that there was now scarcely a Sa ' dl * old ^. Nejd, they were all either in Asir or on their way there, ami that withm one week he anticipated that Saudi military preparations wou . , P , ., own personal view was that the Imam Yahya wou remain u Y S demands that Ibn Saud would soon be pressing upon im an inevitable. “ Before ten days were up we should see wl l at y e ® houl i s !?’• a “ d th first thrust of the Saudi army against the Yemen would be through Najran. 4 He urofessed to be glad to be able to pass on the information to me, tp 3 Saudi'Arab Government entertaining such exceptionally friendly s ®“*™ e f nts the British Government and so forth. He informed me that pter foreig representatives in Jedda had recently requested information the situat on with the Yemen and had been refused. This I took to ^ a reference to Italians here, as Signor Tonci some weeks ago informed me he had made a lerbal The'low estimate entertained by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman of the resources of the Imam Yahya is not borne out by what appears *o be the opmmn of certain of my foreign colleagues here. From conversations with the Turkish [963 g—2]( x ) Not printed. Charge d'Affaires and the Egyptian consul, I gather they consider that Ibn Sand has a formidable task in front of him if he is to maintain his position in Asir They state that the Imam, although himself less intelligent than his rival, has not only greater financial resources, but has better trained and equipped soldiers who are at home in the mountainous country of Asir, where Ibn Sand’s bedouin are at a disadvantage. I do not consider either of my colleagues is particularly ^ well-informed, but their views are perhaps worth a mention. 6. On the 20th October the Umm-al-Qura appeared containing an official communique, a copy of which I enclose herewith,( x ) issued by the Press Depart ment, Mecca, a brief summary of which was telegraphed to you on the 21st October. It was accompanied by a very lengthy leading article, of which I enclose a resume, which is in the form of a reply to a letter addressed by the Imam Yahya to Tahsin-al-Faqir and published in the newspaper Falestin of the 29th September last. I have been able to obtain a copy of the article containing the Imam’s letter and enclose a translation herewith^ 1 ) These articles reveal little of fresh interest; they cover much old ground, protest each in turn the desire of their respective parties for peace and friendship, but bring the prospect of an amicable settlement not a whit nearer. There would indeed appear now but slender hopes for a peaceful solution, and Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman’s prophecy that a clash will occur within a few days seems to destroy the half-formed expectation that the situation might be allowed to remain for the present as one of stalemate. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to His Majesty's Ambassador, Rome; His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan, Jerusalem; the Acting High Commissioner for Egypt, Cairo; the Acting Chief Commissioner, Aden; and to the senior naval officer, Red Sea Sloops.

Your telegram No.l36o Fuad yesterday informed me that the Imam had replied several days ago to the King’s communication of November 10 hi agreeing to a proposal for a conference but ignoring Ibn Baud’s request for the Imam’s views on Saudi desiderata. Ine King had since rejoined pointing out thai aosence of such views made a facile acceptance of conference proposal unsatisfactory. He had repeated his request, re-stated the main heads of his case and was now awaiting Imam's reply® Fuad explained that experience of past conferences showed necessity for a preliminary exchange of views on major issues* he again assured me that no ultimatum had been sent and referred to advice recently offered to Minister in London deprecating issue of ultimatum as a step from which Saudis might find it difficult to recede. he represented frontier situation as unchanged save that in Najran, where no Saudi troops are as yetengaged, a section ot Yam recently inflicted a defeat on the Imemic forces at Wadi Ha.huna, south east of Badr (still in Yemeni hands) which the trihe has now occupied* Fuad again contradicted the reports regarding infraction of frontier near Medio 'R' endSo I made a reference to your concurrence in my view concerning attitude of the Italian government in the event of hostilitieso Fuad thereupon informed me confidentially that the Italian Charge d 1 Affaires had recently given him definite assurance of friendliness of Italian government who intended to preserve good relations with doth Ibn Sand and the Imam and who deplored mischievous rumours and press reports of Italian lack of sympathy* Fuad appeared gratified and I expressed pleasure at news.

Ijl % ■ Sir, •Vith reference to previous correspondence regarding the present dispute between King Ibn Saud and the Imam of the Yemen, I have to inform you that the Saudi-Arabian Minister was ashed to call at this department on the loth November in order that the position might be further discussed. 2. The Minister’s attention was drawn to certain recent statements in the press to the effect that Ibn Saud had in fact issued an ultimatum to the Imam, ana he was ashed whether he had received any further information on this point. Sheihh Hafiz hahba replied that he uad not received any further news from his Government during the past few days but that he believed that the posiuion was still as it had been on the 4th November when he had received a telegram descricing the situation on uiie general lines of your telegram Ho. 186 of hov emoei ^na. The Minister was given the substance ol paragraphs ^ and 3 of vour telegram No. 190 of November 12th, and said tnn'c to the best of his belief this still accurately represented th e present situation. 3. Efforts were maae to impress upon the Sheikh (who haa already been aevised in a similar sense a week or so previously) the importance of the Saudi Government not committing/ k.S.Calvert,Esq. , etc., etc/, etc. Jedda.conunitting themselves to any course of action which it would be difficult for them subsequently to modify,and it was explained to him that, while His Majesty 1 s Government fully realised Ibn baud’s difficulties, they felt that the best and most friendly advice they could give was that he shoulc, continue to be patient and Conciliatory and do all in his power ro avoid hostilities. The Sheikh explained that he haci already faithfully reported this aavice to his Government, but that he wished once more to emphasise the extreme difficulty of the King 1 s positioii. The Imam haa steadily advanced in territory v/hich Ibn baud regarded as his own, and Ibn baud had been obliged to collect large forces to prevent the risk of a further advance. These forces v/ere becoming very restive, and it was extremely expensive to maintain such concentrations. The present situation could not therefore continue indefinitely. It was pointed out to him in reply that it would be even more expensive to embark on hostilities, and that a war might turn out to be an even longer matter. The Sheikh answered that he was convinced that in the event of war the Akhwan could and would easily defeat the Imam T s forces. 4. mfter some further discussion, the opportunity was taken to inform Sheikh Hafiz Wahba that, as he no doubt knew, His Majesty’s Government also had trouble with the Imam on the frontier of the Aden Protectorate, and had lon t been anxious to try to regulate matters with him on this frontier, to secure his evacuation of the small area of the Protectorate which he still occupied, ana to preventthe rish of further incidents. Negotiations to that end had been proceeding with the Imam for some time, and in July the Imam had shown a willingness to negotiate on terms which might he acceptable to His Majesty 1 s Government. The matter had been discussed with the resident at Aden while he was on leave, and, as a result of these discussions, it had been decided to authorise Colonel Beilly to go to Sanaa, as soon as he returned to his post, in order to try to reach a settlement of these frontier questions and to secure the evacuation of the Protectorate territory which was still under the Imam’s occupation. 'The .Resident would prooably there! ore proceed to Sanaa in the near future. Colonel Reilly was being instructed, as soon as he reached Sanaa, to use all his influence with the Imam to try to bring him to a more reasonable and con©iliatory frame of mind vis-d-vis Ibn Saud. It was hoped that this might lead to an improvement in the situation. It was therefore most desirable that the Saudi Government should male every effort to delay any outbreak of hostilities at any rate until Colonel Reilly s arrival at Sanaa on the chance that his influence with the Imam would prove effective. 5. The Sheikh made no comment on Colonel Reilly’s impending visit to Sanaa, and did noi&lt; seem nc.ul. disturbed at the prospect. Cn the other hand, he explained tnat if anything 1 were to be done to bring the Imam to a better frame of mind, it was important that such action should be ta^en without further delay. The Italian Government dia not n at all successful with the Imam, ana appear to have beeIbn Saua deeply suspected them of having aone nothing to discourage the Imam’ s ambitions, i'he answer given to the Sheildi on this point was that, while it was possi ble that some of the local Italian officials in Eritrea and elsewhere might have been somewhat too favourably helined to the Imam, there was no reason to think that this was in fact the view of the Italian Government themselves. Indeed there was still every reason to hope that the Italian Government might be able to exercise a useful influence at Sanaa. His Majesty’s Government were considering whether anything further could be done in this direction; and this was a further reason for not allowing hostilities to break out unnecessarily or prematurely. 6 . The Minister explained that all that was really required was tnat the Imam shoula withdraw his forces from Badr and Hajran. It would not be necessary for the areas to be re-occupied by Ibn Saud; and, once the area had been evacuated oy both sides, it v/ould almost certainly be possible to negotiate a settlement. 7.

Sir Ronald uranam, G.C.M.G.,G.C.¥.0.,C.B., His Britannic Majesty s Ambassador in Rome, and Brigadier-General Sir Gilbert Clayton, n.o.ii..G., K.B.E. fi.B. on behalf of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and His Excellency II Cavaliere Jacopo Gaspanni, Governor of Eritrea, and His Excellency II Grand Uif. R&amp;ffaele Guarigiia, Director-General at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the Italian Government. The above-mentioned delegates have, under instructions from their respective Governments, discussed certain questions re sardine/regarding British and Italian interests in Southern Arabia and the Bed Sea. The delegates, acting under their instructions that the respective policies^f the two Governments in Southern Arabia and the Red Sea should be pursued in a spirit of friendly co-operation and developed on parallel though independent lines, have reached the conclusion that their Governments are in agreement on the following points:- 1. That it is in the common interest of the two Governments to pursue a policy of pacification in order to avoid so far as possible conflicts between the various \ Arab chiefs. 2. That such influence as the two Government may be in a position to exercise respectively with Ibn Saud, the Imam Yahia and the Idrisi of Asir, should be directed towards eliminating causes of conflict in order to arrive, if possible, at pacific and friendly settlements between those chiefs. 3. That while continuing to exert their influence in the cause of peace, the two Government should not intervene in any conflict which, despite the efforts of the two Governmenis towards pacification, may break out between those chiefs. 4. That the guiding principle in British policy in the Red Sea is the security of imperial communications with India and the East. For this purpose His Britannic Majesty 1 s Government regard it as &amp; vital imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on one Arabian shore of the Red Sea, and more particulr.rly on Kamaran or the Farsan Islands, and that neither ivarnaran xior the Farsan Islands shall fall into the hands of an unfriendly Arab ruler. That, on the other hand, it is the interest of Italy, in view of her possessions on the western cOost of the Red Sea., that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian/Arabian shore of the Red Sea, or on Kamaran or the Farsan Islands, and that neither Kamaran nor the Farsan Islands should fall into the hands cf an unfriendly Arab ruler. 5. That there should be economic and commercial freedom on the Arabian coast and the islands of the Red Sea for citizens and subjects of the two countries and that the protection which such citizens and subjects may legitimately expect from their respective Governments should not assume a political character or complexion. 6. That the presence of British officials at Kamaran is solely for the purpose of securing the sanitary service of the pilgrimage to Mecca, but that for administrative reasons His Britannic Majesty’s Government do not consider it possible at present to agree to the Italian request for the participation of an Italian doctor in the quarantine service. But since the Italian Government maintain their point of view in this matter, His Britannic Majesty’s Government are disposed to reconsider the question when the number of pilgrims originating in Italian colonies or possessions increases to such an extent as better to justify the presence of an Italian doctor. 7. That it is in the common interest of the two Governments to use their respective influence with the Arab chiefs in such a manner as to safeguard as far as may be possible the mutual interests of Italy and Great Britain, and that, therefore, it is desirable that the two Governments should, maintain close touch with each other in all questions effecting the Red Sea and Southern Arabia, in order to avoid misunderstandings between them or misapprehensions on one pc it of the Arab chiefs in regard to the policies which iaie .wo Governments intend to follow in the above-mentioned, areas.

Mr. Murray pointed out that 1931 note was reply to specific request of Italian Government • • •Government that His Majesty’s Government should retrain irom any formal and direct exptdssion of their recognition of King Ihn Saudis sovereignty over Asir, Note of 20th October last, on the other hand, represented a general statement of the views of His .ajesty's Government in regard to the political situation in gratia in reply to a similar statement of their views which the Italian Government had been good enough to make. The views of His ...ajesty’s Government in regard to the position of Asir in international law were the same in 1933 as they v/ere in 1931. Signor Buti tried repeatedly to elicit some admission that His Majesty’s Government might be .wlnduoed to-^mo di fy their attitude in this respect but he was given no encouragement to think that there was any chance of such a development. He finally suggested that the whole situation in Arabia should be discussed 'on the basis of the 1927 conversations' by representatives of His Majesty's Government and the Itadian Government. The latter would be represented by Signor Buti himself on this occasion and Signor Gasparini as in 1927, and he assumed that if they concurred in the proposal His Majesty's Government would be represented by myself and by an expert from the Foreign Office. Mr. Murray enquired when Signor Buti suggested that the conversations should take place, to which he replied that Italian Government would, like them if possible to begin not later than the middle of the present month, by when I hope to have presented my letters of credence. Finally, reverting to instructions to Jeddah con tained in your telegram No. 343 (cf. my telegram No.309), Signor Buti • • •It Signor But! said that Italian Government felt that danger of hostilities would t&gt;s greatly reduced if It® Saud could he induced to refrain from the despatch of the ultimatum. It seemed to him that counsels of moderation and restraint would he much less effective after despatch of the ultimatum had taken placCo I should he grateful if you would inform me whether the Italian proposal for discussion of Araoian situation is acceptable to His Majesty's Government and, if so, whether date proposed would he convenient and name of expert who in this case would he sent to Rome to participate 121 the discussions*[This Document is the Property of His B ritannic Majesty’s Government, and should be r eturned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] ) 712/759/25), I'o r a: Code telegraiii to Sir C.

His Majesty's Government understand attitude of Ton Baud and present general position to he as follows:- ■ /d ^*0 Ibn Sand has consistently sought to persuade Imam to agree to peaceful and final settlement of dispute. In fact it is still his ultimate object to reach such a settlement. But Imam has made it clear that he now claims whole of Asir and Nejran, and his continued advance in latter district and recent capture of Badr (of. my telegram No. 100 (of August 3rd) to Jedda, repeated to you as No. 216), Ms made it essenti, for Ibn Sana to resist further encroachments. Mam's advance , , , -I—Uy, eqnrVs military concentrations, has only been checked by ion ^aua o min ^ j- Meanwhile Imam is continuing his intrigues with Idrisi and his attempts to foment renewed rebellion in Asir, and is, according to Ibn Sand, spreading a report that he is receiving help and encouragement from Italian sources* Ton Sand's nain objects non apoear to be to secure (a) withdrawal of I»»'s forces to bebind do facto frontier as it was before outbreak of present conflict, (b) ai;rced estab lishment of that frontier and (e) reaffirmation of prerions agreements.AHis Majesty’s Government have again urged on Ihn Baud, through Saudi Minister here, counsels of patience and moderation, and in particular have pointed out undesirability of Ibn Saud taking up intransigent attitude from which he might subsequently find it difficult to retreat. They have also strongly emphasised wider dangers to which even purely local outbreak of hostilities might lead. But all their information goes to show that the Imam, by his continued advance into territory which seems never previously to have been under Zeidi conrol, by his refusal even to discuss terms with Ibn Saud, and by his continued support of the Idrisi's anti-Saudi activities, is greatly increasing the difficulty of reaching a settlement.

Minister of Finance called on me this morning with Ibn Sand’s-reply contained in lengthy telegram which he read over to me. Translation is being sent by bag: summary is as follows; The King expressed his thanks to His Majesty 5 s Government for advice which he considered showed good will towards himself and his country. He had kept His Majesty’s Government informed of all developments in the situation and they were aware of his desire for peace. They might be assured that had his efforts to this end been successful he would not have taken the military measures that he now had t particularly in view of the expense involved. His overtures of peace had failed and Imam’s intentions were evil. From the foreign press the xving gathered that Imam claims were to Asir, ilhama, and - Na'jran and this wa,s substantiated by letter’s occupation of Najran and advance on Badr, concerning which the Kingis unable to remain silentc Tlie Imain } s activities had also teen directed against Asir and Tihama and had it not teen for the presence of Saudi forces insurrections would have occurred in those parts* Imam was moreover circulating news that he was being encouraged by Italian government end had been promised assistance by them in the event of trouble* Yemeni policy in short was first to weaken Ibn Sail by fomenting internal dissention by Involving him in heavy financial expenditure s then to launch the attacko The King is therefore bound to take defensive measures 0 Affairs had now come to such a pa.ss that a settlement wa.s necessary and snould be sucn that the Imam would be left no excuse for causing cii-LJ-culuicu in the future* The King summarised his claims as follows 1, Idrisi to be handed over and Imam to cease intrigue and disturbing peace* 2 * Najran to be evacuated; question of frontier and damage suffered to be liquidated saosequent.Ly 0 3o The present frontiers to 00 GscaolioAcd (Minister of Finance himself explained by a treaty or exchange of not e s)* 4o 'Establishmentof the present treaty in force between the two countries.

Signor Guarnasehelli said that he desired to reflect before commenting on what he termed a n mise an pointthe frankness and friendliness of which he admitted. never theless he seemed to indicate that the definite and presumably final refusal of His Majesty's Government to regard the question of Asir as in any way open could hardly be reconciled with the conclusions of the Home conversations of 1927.

(39/111/33) HOIE VEHBAIE His Majesty’s Einbassy present their compliments to the Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs and, with reference to the Ministry’s Rote Verbale Ho. 228396/118 of September 21st last, have the honour, under instructions, to make the following communication regarding the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom towards the existing dispute between the Imam Yahia of the Yemen and King Ibn Saud. 2. In so far as this turns on territorial questions and so far as they themselves are concerned. His Majesty’s Government regard the question of the sovereignty of Asir as determined by their entry in 1931 into correspondence with the Hejazi Government regarding the establishment of communications between certain places under British administration and the Asiri port of Jizan (see the Embassy’s Rote Verbale Ho. 296 of July 24th, 1931). It is true that, in order to meet the views of the Italian Government they have so far deferred any formal and direct expression of the recognition of the sovereignty of King Ibn Saud over Asir (which for their part they believe to be de facto and de jure valid); but the action referred to above has nevertheless, in their opinion, constituted an informal admission of King Ibn Saud’s rights in that province, which he is most unlikely ever to give up unless obliged to do so by force of arms. 3. In regard to Ibn Saud* s immediate intentions, there seems to be some divergence between the views of the Italian /andand British G-overnments• These must necessarily be, in the last resort, a matter of speculation; but after consider ing all the available evidence. His Majesty’s Government are of the opinion that Ibn Baud does not desire to under take a campaign against the Imam, still less operations on the very large scale necessary to menace Yemeni independence For such operations the financial and the political strain would almost certainly prove too great. In particular, it is becoming increasingly difficult for His Majesty to collect the Hejdi tribesmen for further warfare in the south For these reasons His Majesty’s Government do not consider that it is possible to regard the present military preparations of Ibn Sand as comparable to those made before the successful attack on the Hejaz in 1924-25; and the most likely interpretation of them is that, having failed to secure any but the most evasive replies to his representa tions to the Imam, Ibn Baud intends to exact a satisfactory answer by supporting his final demand with a threat of force* So far as His Majesty’s Government are aware, the Imam does not yet seem to have responded to Ibn Baud’s full statement of his case. 5. In these circumstances the question arises whether His Majesty’s Government can in fact restrain Ibn Baud from his present course by exercising their inxluence. It may be said at once that any analogy drawn from the recent treaty between Ibn Baud and the Amir Abdullah of Trans jordan is inapplicable since, in that case, His Majesty’s Government were in a position to exert their influence over both parties, and thus bring about a rappro^ement. in the present instance, unless the Imam shows signs of willingness to negotiate, there is little hope that they will be able to restrain Ibn Baud. They will in any case almost certainly be unable to do so before his preparations /areaxe completed, and. In their view, the only moments at which they are likely to he able to make their influence felt at all are either when the Imam definitely offers to settle by negotiation the outstanding differences between himself and Ibn Saud ( a move which, according to the present evidence, he has not yet made), or at the actual moment when Ibn Sand 1 s ultimatum is delivered. At either of these junc tures it would be possible for His Majesty^ G-cw eminent and the Italian Government to intervene with all the persuasion at their command to induce the two rulers to listen to reason and to settle their differences by nego tiation. Failing a conciliatoryr eply from the Imam before Ibn Baud's military preparations are complete, there appears to be no prospect of an earlier solution of the crisis, and His Majesty's Government feel that their intervention would be entirely ineffective, unless they were prepared in their turn to threaten Ibn Saud with forcible action if he did not come to terms with the Imam - a course which seems to them both unwise in itself and unjustified by the facts of the position as they see them. 6 . In conclusion, His Majesty's Bnbassy are to state that His Majesty's Government have given the closest and most sympathetic attention to the arguments already advanced by the Italian Government, and that they are most anxious, if possible, to work in concert with the Italian Government with the object of averting the threatened hostilities in Arabia. Ihey trust that the Italian Government will now agree that, for the reasons which have been fully and frankly advanced, the intervention of His Majesty's Government at this stage would not have any effect SJhey are, however, prepared to exert to the full whatever influence they possess either when the present deadlock inthe telegraphic correspondence between the two rulers is resolved, or at latest before the actual outbreak of hostilities, and they feel confident that they may count on the continued co-operation of the Italian Government when the moment arrives for such intervention^ BRITISH EMBASSY, ROME. 20th October, 1933.0 A M—ryX—rf 3517.

He expressed his personal opinion which he thought Itn Baud would endorse that Imam should show con ciliatory spirit Toy evacuating Najran and Toy handing over Idrisi. He drew attention to Imam’s treatment of more than one of miudi delegations in the past; contrasted Imam’s aggression with non Baud’s defensive attitude and asked what guarantee had the King that Imam wound abandon that attitude if Saudi troops were withdrawn.

Extract from Kuwait intelligence Summary for September 1933* II. RIATH NEWS AND WAR HUMOURS. (a) These have 'been so many and frequent'throughout September, that I have decided to give a summary of the news as given me by the more reliable of my informants, rathei than attempt, in any way to sift the immense volume of rumour and gossip, that has come in almost daily from Riath, Qassim and Bedouin sources* (b) The following was supplied by His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait on 6th September 1933: (1) Kuwait bazaar rumour had it that Bin Saud had ordered 50,000 bags of rice from India to go direct to Has Tanura near Qatif, and tenders were already being asked for from dhow owners for the transportation of this consignment from Ras Tanura to Ojair. Rs.25/- per 100 bags had already been offered* Comments* No doubt the Political Agent, Bahrain, is in possession of the correct facts* (ii)He confirmed the news that the export of dates from Hassa had been forbidden by the King* (iii)The 2,000 men sent by Ibn Saud down the Wadi Dawasir in August which he (the Shaikh) had said, had been recalled, had merely been ordered to hold fast, they had not been withdrawn* (See para.V(d), (iii) of my August Summary)* (c) The following news was supplied on 10th September by a minor Shaikh of the Mahfuth section of the Ajman, who resides in Kuwait territory. He had left Riath on 24th August* (i) The Hassa tribes were concentrating their fighting forces in the A1 Juda area at Najbiyel: under the direction of Ibn Jaloui. Both places were north west of Hoffuf and water and grazing were plentiful* (ii) (ii) The force so collected was to be under the command of Saud, Ibn Jalou^s son*(iii) Til© place for the concentration had been selected for its proximity to Hoffuf, whence dates, rice and supplies generally could be easily transported to them* (iv) Riath gossip was that Nejran was to be the King*s objective* (v) He had heard the King in open Mejliss say that Yemen forces had overrun the whole of Nejran and were in complete occupation of the valley* (vi) Several Nejran Shaikhs had arrived at Bin Sand*s court, notably Ibn Mana, to beg for help against the Imam Yahya* (vii) He had heard in Riath that Ibn Rabaiyan (Ataiba), A1 Firm (Harb) and Mashari Ibn Musaiyis (Mutair) were all trying to get out of sending war contingents to the capital, and that the King was anxious lest tnese Chiefs should suddenly defy him, and make his task of mobilization difficult* (viii) He had returned ffr om Riath via Hoffuf and the coast, and saw contingents of Ajman Bani Hajii and Awazim everywhere moving south to A1 Juda* (ix) He noticed that Awazim non-combatants with women and children were moving into the Kuwait Neutral Zone. These, thought he, were planning to come up to Kuwait for supplies, taking advantage of the partial disorganisation that had occurred in the Blockade arrangements as a result of war rumours* (d) The following was given me by a reliable Shaikh of the Jiblan section of the Mutair on 15th Septemberi — (i) Faisal bin Aun of'Medina had sent to Riath 20 herds (Assas) of 30 camels each* (ii) Faisal bin Sulaiman of Taif had sent to Riath 15 Assas of 50 camels each. (iii) He confirmed story that Ibn Rabaiyan had arrived at Riath with eleven mares and two ladies, and that the King had forgiven him publicly for having refused to attend when first summoned and had further excused Ataiba from sending a war contingent* (iv) A1 Firm, Shaikh of Harb had written in to say that he was prepared to go and fight towards the north, east or west, but could not go south as he was no longer a young man, but that the King had refused to excuse him* (v) (v) Ibn Masaad, Governor of Hail, had beai informed by the King that Hail and Shammar f*e€ need not supply any contingents* Their role3* was to watch the north and west, (vi) The Mutair (Llwa) Chiefs, Ibn Shuqair and I bn Maziad. had been to Riath early in September to excuse themselves for their inability to bring men, but without success. (e) The following was brought me by a reliable Kuwaiti of Mutair origin. He reached Kuwait on 24th September from Riath after visiting Buraida, Anaiza, Zilfi, Najmaa, Artawiyeh. (a) All towns of Qassim including all 'hayars* i.e. Akhwan settlements, had sent their contingents to Riath. (b) All persons who had gone on 'rfiazzi' to Asir last year were by Royal decree excused this year. (c) Among those excused were Ibn Musaad, Governor of Hail, Ibn Rabaivan and wnole of Ataiba, and Mashari ibn lusaiyis, Shaikh of Artawiyeh. (d) A1 Mutair (llwa and Wasil) including the^ following well-known Shaikhs: Ibn ohuqair al Fuqum, Ibn Lanir. Ibn Shiblan. Ibn Jarbuh, Ibn Shuwainbat and Ibn Ashwan. had after much wavering moved to Al Juda with their respective fighting men. (e) Al Harb had also marched in spite of many lamentations on the part of their Chief, Al Firm. (f) The Al Juda force was under orders of Ibn Jaloui*s son, while the Riath concentration was under orders of Saud bin Abdul Aziz. (g) The King had intimated that he would ^ himself take supreme command. (h) The King's objective was definitely now Nejran. not Asir, and the route would be via Soiaiyil Dam, Bisha and Tathlith. (i) The Imam Yahya had sent a fprmal declaration of war ”Rad al to Bin Saud saying, 'Beware, my son, Saif al Islam is proceeding to invade your country'. Bin Saud is said to have replied with the laconic message, 'He is welcome, I have also a son, who will meet him, and give him his deserts'. (f) (i) On 27th September His Excellency theShaikh of Kuwait informed me that one of his trusty Ajman messengers had just returned from Riath (25.9.33). He had/4. had actually dined with Ibn Mana, Shaikh of the Hej ran tribes (Yam), who was a refugee with Bin Saud, Ibn Mana had told him that he had recently sent back to Nejran 4 of his men by the King’s ofxlers to bring news of the strength of the Yemen forces. That they had been captured and made to confess their errand: upon which Saif al Islam had ordered them to be taken round and shown everything possible, and then sent back to Bin Saud to tell the latter what they had seen. (ii) The same informant brou^it the report that the King had given out that he would himself shortly motor down to Al Juda and inspect the force concentrated there. (iii) The Shaikh opined that Bin Saud would not go to war even yet, as such would be too dangerous for him. All the talk of war, etc. etc. was so much bluff he thought, and the King would leave himself a loophole as a 'face saver’. Comment . I am inclined to agree with this view.- ® cJC^ No 3 S~0 IJjz t I 2557i (Reference paragraph 2525).

CONFIDENTIAL. r* September 27 19 Section P.Z. 1719 1933 E 5730/759/25] No. 1. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—(Received September 27.) (No. 290.) Sir, Jedda, September 12, 1933. WITH reference to my despatch No. 275 of the 29th August last, relative to the strained relations at present existing between the rulers of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, and the recent telegraphic exchanges that have taken place between them, I have the honour to inform you that from my conversation with Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman on the 7th September, briefly reported to you by telegram the same day, I understand that his correspondence with the Imam Yahya has so far yielded Ibn Saud scant satisfaction. The series of telegrams addressed to the Imam, the gist of which was reported in my despatch under reference, embodying all the main heads of the Saudi case, had been carefully designed to leave no doubt or ambiguity in the way of an equally considered reply by the Imam. A repy was, indeed, in due course received, but beyond a Koranic text and a platitude, contained no more than a bare, and rather dismissive, acknowledg ment. The Minister of Finance did not dwell on the matter .at any length, but I gathered the impression that the failure of this attempt to elicit a reasoned reply had been received by Ibn Saud with chagrin and a deepening of his resolve to seek, if other means failed, a solution by a resort to force of arms. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman stated that, in his personal opinion, matters would now be allowed to rest where they were until the King had completed his military dispositions, whereupon he would confront the Imam with an ultimatum. 2. That this was no idle speculation seems daily more and more evident. I have reported by telegram and in my despatch under reference that, as long as five weeks ago, Saudi forces of the North-Eastern £ / Command ” were ordered to proceed in the direction of the Najran district, if, indeed, they were not to the district itself, and since then rumours have been current to the effect that recruiting has been actively carried on of late in the Medina and laif districts, and that the forces so collected have been drafted south. . , , 3 I have to-day reported by telegram that over 700 soldiers were embarked here and left by steamer yesterday tor Jizan. So large a force can scarcely be explained by the normal requirements of garrison duty m Asir or of replace ments and reliefs. Ibn Sand’s military preparations are, it seems certain approaching completion, and unless the Imam Yahya can be persuaded to adopt amore conciliatory attitude, it is to be feared that an armed clash cannot be very distant. more recent developments have naturally excited a good deal of interest and a certain measure of apprehension locally. I extract from the Egyptian Gazette of the 6th September m which the Jedda correspondent of tClhram fairly accurately summarises far as thev are generally known here.C) I also enclose a furthei report wmen appeared m the^Eqyptian Gazette of the 2nd September, m which the Ahram s Rome correspondent records information obtained ^“s^ffafte/thempture of nature of the first letter addressed by the Imam to Ibn baud alter the rupture oi negotiationsat Sanaa hid confided to the Saudi delegation to dehver to the Km^ In paragraph (b) of my telegram No. 15p_of hinted desnatch Ss® ,t !£. letter proposed «h,« Ibn S“d of top Ypmpn and that the consideration of other questions m dispute snouiu ue ^tphlrFVom ttopress report, whose ^-jy^^^htrthfze di His Maicstv’s Ambassador at Rome to verify, it would appear ttiat tne z,eiai overture?was conceived in, perhaps, not quite such intransigent terms as Ibn Sand would have us believe. ( l )Not printed. [907 dd—4] y/f/2 5. Events seem to be steadily marching towards a climax and from the determination which Ibn Sand is pursuing his military plans the possibilities of a peaceful settlement and the efficacy of sedative counsels are just as steadily diminishing. 6. Copies of this despatch and enclosures are being sent to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome, His Majesty’s High Commissioners for Egypt and Trans jordan, the Acting Commissioner, Aden, and to the Senior Naval Officer in th~~ Red Sea Sloops. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from the Egyptian Gazette of September 2, 1933. Yemen-Saudi Relations. THE ^Aram’s Rome correspondent learns from a reliable source that when the Saudi delegation which had been to Sanaa, the capital of the Yemen, to discuss outstanding questions between the Saudi Kingdom and the Yemen with the Imam Yahya, and which was for some time kept virtual prisoner, returned to Mecca and Riad, the capital of the Nejd, it carried with it a lengthy letter from the Imam to King Ibn Saud regarding the questions which the delegations had gone to discuss. Although the contents of the letter are not yet fully known, declares the correspondent, it is certain that the Imam has expressed a desire to conclude a treaty of defence with King Ibn Saud. It would appear, he continues, that the Imam’s viewpoint on the subject is that he would like a treaty with King Ibn Saud, but that he is about to conclude a treaty of friendship and bqn-voisinage ’ ’ with Britain regarding the nine protected settlements, and he believes that the conclusion of a treaty between him and King Ibn Saud would obstruct the progress of negotiations between him and Great Britain and might be given an unsuitable interpretation by Italy and Russia. The Frontier Question. ' The Imam’s opinion of the frontier question is that the inhabitants of the district of Najran, the subject of dispute, are neither Sunnis nor Zeidis, and that they have never actually been subject to the Yemen or to the Nejd, and that, there fore, he considers that the occupation of this district does not constitute a violation of pledges or transgression on Nejd. As regards Asir and Tihama, the Imam maintains that although these two territories were handed over to King Ibn Saud by their original rulers, A1 Aid and the Idrisi, yet there are historical considerations which induce him to consider these two territories as part of the Yemen. Nevertheless the Imam has suggested an alternative solution of the problem, namely, that the Idrisi should again be allowed to rule over these two territories and should be given the choice to conclude a treaty with whichever side they wish. King Ibn Saud’s opinion on this subject is not yet known. All Moslems in Egypt are Sunnis. The great majority of Moslems in Iraq and in Persia are Shias.

CONFIDENTIAL. [E 5805/759/25] No. 1. September SO, 1 Section 1 Memorandum respecting Saudi-Yemeni Relations. (Confidential.) I HAD a conversation this morning with Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, assisted by M. Zada, about the Najran situation. I explained that I was puzzled as to the exact significance of the expression “ Najran,” and as to the precise nature of the present situation. As regards the latter, Fuad Bey Hamza had expressly told me in June that the operations of the Yemeni forces, while giving ground for anxiety, were confined to what was admittedly Yemeni territory. He had distinguished between “ Najran ” as being Saudi and the Beni Yam as being Yemeni, and, on my pressing him, had identified the admittedly Yemeni territory with the geographical name of “ Jauf.” The last information he had given me before we both left Jedda was that Seif-ul-Islam Ahmed and his brother, operating against the local tribes, had sustained a reverse and been driven back, but were preparing a counter-attack. It was now suggested that the Yemenis were in Saudi territory, but I could not find any precision as to when they had altered the-situation, as described to me by Fuad Bey, by crossing the alleged frontier. 2. Sheikh Hafiz admitted that the use of the name “Najran” in Arab geographical parlance was very vague. It merely meant the area on the confines of the Yemen, but could not be defined as having geographical boundaries. He admitted also that the 1927 agreement was an oral arrangement, but it was an agreement which the Imam himself had invoked on several occasions and notably when asserting his claim to Jebel Arwa in 1931. The sheikh and M. Zada agreed that there had been a definite change in the situation since the early summer. The Yemenis had succeeded in their operations against the tribes, and flushed with this success, had pushed on into Saudi territory, advancing to the neighbourhood of Badar, without meeting with opposition, and then stopping short. Sheikh Hafiz’s first telegrams regarding the actual presence of the Yemenis in Saudi territory had reached him about the beginning of August. The Imam’s attitude, according to M. Zada, was that Ibn Sand had no officials or forces in the invaded area, and that he (the Imam) was free to do what he liked there. 3. Sheikh Hafiz agreed with me that, as regards the frontier, a distinction must be made between (a) the frontier between Najran and the Yemen, which, in the Saudi view, was settled in 1927; and (b) the frontier between what is now called Asir Tihama {i.e., the late Idrisi’s territory) and the Yemen, which was settled in 1931. I did not gather that the frontier at {a) was expressly confirmed in the 1931 negotiations, which had turned only on Jebel Arwa, although, as stated above, the Imam had invoked the 1927 agreement when claiming Jebel Arwa. Sheikh Hafiz agreed that Saada was Yemeni, but said that Waila was Saudi. 4. I confined the conversation to an elucidation of the facts, as viewed by the Saudi Government, and avoided any mention of the merits of the quarrel or Ibn Sand’s military preparations. Sheikh Hafiz and M. Zada, while describing the situation as recorded above, appeared to share the general ignorance regarding the exact geography of the region. * B b r ANDREW RYAN.

The following were the main points of interest in a general conversation which I had with Mr. Philhy yesterday afternoon. As I have reported from Jedda Mr# i’hilhy nowadays speaks to me pretty freely. I told him that I made use of what he told me for the information of His Majesty’s Government hut that, subject to this, he could always rely on me to respect his confidence and avoid compromising him* Nejran. Mr* Philhy could throw no light on the alleged agreement of 1927 between Ibn Saud and the Imam. Geographi cally he distinguishes between the two regions of Hejran and Jauf, as Fuad Hamza did in June, but he scouted the suggestion of Fuad Bey that the Beni Yam could be identified as Yemeni. On the contrary, he said, they intruded far into Saudi territory, as far indeed as Bisha and it was they who peopled Hejran# Commenting on the statement made to me at the Saudi Legation the other day that the Imam relied on the non existence of Saudi posts in He j ran, Mr. Philby said that, after Ibn Baud’s military operations in that area early last year (which were important, though little was known of them at the time), the King made a composition with the tribesmen, by which he undertook not to interfere in their territory&gt; provided they behaved as loyal subjects and kept the peace. Mr. Philby places this in March 1932.

IN continuation of my despatch No. 273 of to-day’s date and with reference to my telegram No. 161 of the 24th August, relative to the possibility of the outbreak of hostilities between King Ibn Saud and the Imam of the Yemen, I have the honour to report that Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, who has been in Jedda since my meeting with him on the 24th August, yesterday requested a further interview with me. I accordingly called on him in the afternoon at the Khuzan Palace. 2. He produced a sheaf of telegrams which, he explained, he had just received from the Amir Feisal with instructions to read them over to me. I was not offered copies of these telegrams, as on previous occasions, but perused them, with the Minister of Finance, sentence by sentence. As the telegrams were six in number and, of these, four were long and not a little involved, it may be that the following summary may not be in every respect complete, but I believe, in the main, the contents of the telegrams, particularly in regard to the more important points, have been adequately retained. 3. The telegrams were prefaced by a short note, also in the form of a telegram. It was carefully read by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman and stated that, from information received in Riyadh, it appeared that Imam Yahya was mobilising his forces in the Yemen and that therefore Ibn Saud had ordered the Saudi forces on the north-east of Nejd to proceed to the south-west, i.e., to Asir, as a reinforcement to the troops already there. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman here explained that the military forces of Saudi Arabia are divided into three zones, or commands, the north-western (which had dealt with the Ibn Rifada rebellion), the north-eastern and the south-western. He described this measure as a purely precautionary one, and, in reply to a question, informed me that the orders had been issued three weeks ago. He added that he had heard, but not officially, that, should the situation deteriorate and the use of force become inevitable, Amir Saud, the King’s eldest son, would probably be appointed to command the troops operating in Asir. He was unaware whether the troops of the North-Eastern t£ Command ” had yet arrived in Asir, but thought not. 4. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman did not enlighten me as to the address to which this telegram, if telegram it was, had been sent, but I inferred that it had been sent by the King to Amir Feisal at Taif. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman then proceeded to read five telegrams, all of which, he informed me, had been sent by Ibn Saud to Imam Yahya. It would appear, although the Minister of Finance himself was not clear on the point, that the Imam’s letter to Ibn Saud, entrusted to the delegation who wirelessed the contents to Riyadh (as reported in my telegram No. 158 of the 19th August), and to which Ibn Saud replied at length had, indeed, 'elicited a reply from the Imam in which he stated that he was quite unable to grasp the meaning of Ibn Sand’s telegram or understand the demands he was putting forward. To this, Ibn Saud rejoined, in the first of the five telegrams read by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, that, although ho considered his position perfectly understandable, yet for the sake of clarity he would put each of his mam points in a separate telegram. In this rather lengthy introductory telegram he recalled the measure of agreement reached previously and embodied in the treaty between them, and called attention to the signal gesture of conciliation, affording proof of his desire for a permanent settlement, in his action over the Arwa mountains dispute. 5 Of the four telegrams embodying his desiderata, the first dealt with the Tihamat Asir, a question which Ibn Saud regarded as concerning himself and the Imam only and one which had been definitely settled by their treaty. The [907 p—1]2 P intention here would appear to be to exclude the Idrisi from any consideration in respect of a territory which had previously been an essentially Idrisi sphere. 6. The remaining three telegrams were somewhat more complicated. Ibn Saud set forth at length his claims in respect of the Beni Yam, with whom manyr^T of the tribes of Nejd were intimately related—which could not be said of the Yemen’s relations with that congeries of tribes. A division of the various sections in accordance with their individual affiliations was proposed. The treaty was repeatedly invoked with reference to the Najran, Ibn Saud maintaining that the agreement concluded between the Imam and the Saudi delegates, Ibn Duleym and Turki-al-Mahdi, provided for a division of that territory, from Weileh to the south to go to the Yemen and from Weileh to the north to Saudi Arabia. This was the agreement to which the Imam Yahya had set his hand, yet which had so far only been honoured in the breach. 7. The protection and assistance offered by the Imam to the Idrisi drew bitter words from the King. Ibn Saud had allowed the Idrisi to remain with Imam Yahya, upon the conclusion of the treaty, for two reasons : Firstly, because of his (Ibn Saud’s) affection for his brother the Imam, and, secondly, because the Imam had given a guarantee for the good conduct of the Idrisi whilst within his territories. This guarantee, also, had not been observed, for the Imam must be only too well aware of the activities of the Idrisi in fomenting discontent along the frontier. The Idrisi was, after all, a very paltry fellow. Had not he been driven out of Jizan, horse, foot and artillery, at the time of the Asir revolt, by a mere 300 Saudi soldiers! He was, moreover, a liar and cheat, and Ibn Saud would tolerate no more of his mischief-making, but would ruthlessly punish should he (the Idrisi) pursue his present tactics. It was suggested, therefore, that the Idrisi should be expelled from the Yemen before further complications occurred and the relations between the two rulers were involved in the trouble. At any rate, Ibn Saud added a little significantly, all the necessary measures had been taken to deal with the Idrisi and those who were assisting him. 8. This summary is necessarily bald and somewhat simplihed. I may perhaps record that I became increasingly conscious of the determination with which Ibn Saud was putting forward his demands. The telegrams, it seemed to me, contained noticeably less than the usual seasoning of pious utterances with which he is wont to lard his communications. He seemed to mean business. The telegrams were sent some ten days ago and so far no reply has been received from Sana. The delay in communicating them' to me was explained by the absence of Amir Feisal recently, with his family, in Khurma, a village some little distance east of Taif, and Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman’s own absence for a time in Nejd (where, however, it may be mentioned, he had not seen the King). 9. I questioned Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman concerning the treaty between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen in regard to the frontier in the Najran area. He admitted that .he was unable to tell me whether the agreement was a written one or whether it was merely a verbal understanding. He informed me that a number of the leading tribal personages of the Beni Yam had recentlv been to Rivadh for a conference with the King. 10. It may be perhaps inferred from the stand now taken by Ibn Saud that his attitude is stiffening slightly. Feeling reassured as to the security of his noi them and other frontiers and enriched by the recent arrival of a handsome sum in ready cash, which he no doubt regards as the earnest of more to come, King Ibn Saud may now conceivably feel more able to take a strong line. 11. Copies of this despatch are being sent to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Rome and Bagdad, His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan, the senior naval officer in the Red Sea sloops, and to the Acting Chief Commissioner at Aden.

I AM requested by the Government of His Majesty the King to inform you of the following, with a view to its communication to the authorities concerned ii His Britannic Majesty’s Government:— 2. The Imam Yahya, in one of the meetings which were held between the delegation of the Government of His Majesty the King and the Imam Yahya, said that the Italian Government’s representative (who has been deputed for the purpose of renewing the treaty which was concluded between the Imam Yahya and the Italian Government, which expires in a year and a half, and who (the representative) was at that time in Sana and is said to have left a week before the return of the delegation without arriving at any useful result), asked the Imam Yahya in one of their meetings about his point of view regarding the Idrisi’s territory and Asir. He added that the Italian Government have certain views and intentions in regard to these territories, and that they have not recognised them as belonging to the Government of Ibn Saud. The Imam answered him saying that he also had not recognised Ibn Saud’s claim either to the territory or to Asir. Both of them demand them (the two teriitoiies) for themselves. He (the Imam Yahya) asked the Italian representative to com municate to him the advice of his Government as to how he should attain his intentions and whether this should be done in a military or in a peaceful manner. Immediately after that, the Italian representative asked his Government tor their advice, and he subsequently informed Yahya that his Government did not wish to express their views in this connexion, but that they requested that the Imam should give his own opinion first and state his intentions and objects. I he Imam Yahya fhen changed the subject and did not tell the d ® le f?; tlo ^ ab ? ut t] ] e remainder of the Italian Government’s reply. There is no doubt that the Imam s intention was only to pick a quarrel and to threaten. He requested the delegation verv strictly not to mention this statement to any cm e ; ^3 The Imam Yahya sent a letter to His Majesty the King through the Saudi' Arab delegation, requesting him to recognise Hajran as be onging to the Imam Yahva and that other matters could be postponed until later The delegation communicated the contents of the letter to His Majesty the King by wireless from Jizan. His Majesty the King replied that this was impossible and that he could not agree to it unless they came to an agreement over all the matters in dispute. No reply has yet been received about this from the Imam Yah) a. [907 m—2]r 2 4.

The wording of the telegrams, the translations of which have been carefully checked, is in places vague, but King Faisal’s declaration of preparedness to acceot any service in the settlement of the difference between ia’udi Arabia and the Yemen can only mean an offer, on his part, to act as mediator. 3. Apart from this offer and its polite but non committal acknowledgment in Ibn 3a ’fid’s reply, perhaps the most notable feature of this exchange is King Faisal’s appeal to Ibn 3s \ad, ”in the name of your brothers, the Arabs of other countries, 'to pursue peaceful means of bringing his differences with Im&amp;m Yahya to a settlement, in order to spare Arabia from the horrors of a fratricidal struggle.

We are anxious about the news repeatedly published in the newspapers regarding the unusual dispute which has taken/ place between Your Majesty and His Highness the Brother Imam Yahya Hamiduddin and which may possibly lead to unsatisfactory results. I am quite confident that you both, of all people, i.v are more careful than others (to prevent) the shedding of Arab blood. In the name of your brothers, the Arabs of other countries, I hope that you will think over the matter and settle this dispute - if dispute there be - by peaceful means. I, as a brother to both of you state that I am prepared to accept any service whatever its nature in this matter. FaisalOovj of telegraphic Message in reply from King Ihn ba ? ft&amp; to King Faisal. * I His Majesty the Brother King Faisal, Bagdad. I thank His Majesty, my dear brother, for his anxiety regarding the prevention of the shedding of Arab blood because this interests all Moslems whether they are Arabs or not. fhe news which has been published in the newspapers and which perturbed the brother (King Faisal) regarding the dispute which has occurred between us (me) and our brother the Imam Yahya, has also perturbed and grieved us because we do not like to hear any news of a, dispute between Muslims in general and Arabs in particular. As regards that which is taking place between us (me) and the brother of all (i*e. of both Ibn ca r ud and Faisal - Irn&amp;m Yahya) we pray to God (to prevent) the shedding of Moslem blood and to inspire all (of us) with wisdom. The ded brother (King Faisal) is not unaware of our attitude towards all Arabs. We have given up many of our rights (? the protection of our rights) until the matter becomes more serious when the position will compel us to a defence (to defend ourselves) which will be unavoidable. May God help us.’ He who accustomed us to do good deeds will help usi The dispute which is taking place between us (me) and the brother Imam Yahya is not due to the occurrence of an incident, but, to our insistence that he should adhere to treaties and agreements previously concluded between us (me) and him. We demanded the confirmtion of the treaties and agreements and his compliance with their provisions and the maintenance of friendship and neighbourliness which would ensure, neither more of less, the comfort of Moslems Up to this hour Your brother (ibn Sa f &amp;d) is doing his best to give advice and to prevent evil. We pray to God to guide us andand nim (Im§® Yaiiya) to that which is advantageous to our religion and to our world. The brother (King Faisal) may 00 sure that we will not take any hostile action until we are compelled to defend (ourselves). There is no might and power but in God. If God wills we will not take any action contrary to the commands of the Sharia or that which may cause harm to Moslems. Ve express our gratitude for his preparedness to offer his services in the matter and also to all Muslims who showed a similar willingness. This (? Ibn Bahld ? s forbearance) is what God commanded in His Book and we pray to Clod to give victory to His Religion and to raise His ford on high and to stamp out insurrection and to prevent bloodshed.

I Mr, Murray's despatch No, 722 (of the 22nd Sepfcenher, Saudi .•Yemeni relations). it is undesirable to embark on argument with Italian Government as to territorial claims of Ibn Baud and imam, geographical and political facts being obscure, Nor is io neuesccuy to reafx.Lrm atoivude of His Majesty's Govern ment towards Ibn Sand's position in Asir, since this is a±reaay well known to the Italian G-overnment (see Mr.Arthur Henderson's despatch No. 892 of (the 17th July,) 1931 ). bou should therefore reply that His Majesty's Govern ment have at frequent intervals urged moderation on Ibn Saud and will continue to use all their influence to this end. Meanwhile they await with interest any further information which the Italian Government may be able to obtain from the Imam, For your own information, I consider that main weak ness of Imam's position in present dispute is not so much his alleged violation of ill defined frontier arrangements (although it seems clear that he has penetrated well into Asir) as his evasion of Itn Sand's demands for discussion _(see Mr. Calvert's telegram No. 163 of 7th September). From this it seems unlikely that representations by His Majesty's Government would restrain Ibn Baud from com pleting his military preparations.
