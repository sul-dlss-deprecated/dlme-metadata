Dear Peel, I send herewith a copy of the Adyertiser.ent inserted by the i inistry of Labour &lt;!: National Jervice ( Lrs. Dtuart of Dardinia Nouse, Kinfsway, N.C.2. has been dealing with the natter) through whom the Company are recruiting a number of men wanted for the Company's operations in Bahrain, to ether with a copy of each of two lists of men who have, I undej’stanct, applied for 'obs as a result. . Recently, I have had deal'with two cases snr. e- what siiailar to that of Boyle f Boyle is the man who broke his engagement to return to Bahrain from Couth Africa. One of these additional cases is that of a nan na ed T.N. Berry. Be left Bahrain on the 2nd. February 1943 for his long vacation in ~»outh Africa, the unders tandin ( ' between him and tine Company be inf that he should retrun to enter into a further Contract if a backache he complained of ( which apparently he had Prior to his entering the service of the Company) was not arainst his doing so. Berry saw a Jpecialist during the last fortnight^of ' is three months' leave; the .jpecialist advised that there’^sVe . obstruction to one kidney, and that he should be operated upon in order to ascertain precisely the trouble. The company told Berry to cone hone, and there ended the arranrement that he should return to Bahrain. I learned on Monday that the Company's own Expert who has seen Berry here, and who was asked whether it was advisable he should return to Bahrain, diagnoses the trouble as a ' congenital malformation of the left kidney, which is a permanent disability; as he rets older this is liable to get worse and there may be complications; the kidney should be moved; it is inadvisable for Berry to return to Bahrain Island, Persian fulf.' By impression was and is, from letters ^erry wrote subsequently to the Company, that he believed there was nothing the natter with him, and he had played upon the belief that the Company mould not permit him to return until he had seen someone in England. This belief he would have founded upon knowledge acquired as a member of the Personnel Department in Bahrain. The second case is that of D.C. Roods, who likewise went to Couth Africa for his holiday, with an engagement to return to Bahrain for further employment. Be managed to find a very bad ankle, which also ended in his being sent to London. Be has not sourht re-engagement. From the medical opinions, there would appear to be very little wrong with his ankle. This man is ow making rather an impudent claim for additional travel time. The moral of these two stories is that these young men are getting home on one pretext oruother and making tki: gs exceed ingly difficult for. the Company. There would appear to be quite a number of rn en now available in the United.kingdom for essential work abroad. This fact, combined with the fact that men are com ing home to the Uni tend Kingdom on leave because of additional transport facilities, makes the Persian Gulf Regulation Bo.2 appear to be now impracticable. Perhaps you would be rood enough to give some consideration to the necessity for continuing the Regulation, Yours sincerely, Jd. H.R. Ballantyne. K.T.Peel Bsq. , C. L3.B. ,H.C.

Please refer to Your Excellency's letter TIo. 25/45/44 dated the 28th Hay 1944 and its enclosures 2. The Joint Board inside the A.I.O.C. has now been established, and at its first : eetin^, elected representatives to serve on the proposed Consul's Corr.ittee which will consider anplications for termination of employment. 3. For the reasons piven in parapraoh 2 of my Javinprara Bo.5 of 10th Hay, both Pattinson and I still feel that it would be impracticable for the Consul's Committee to consider anplications to which the mam.genent have already signified their apreement. Moreover, it seems to us doubtful whether there is in iact,any demand that such anplications should be submitted to the Commi ttee. To clear up this doubt, Pattinson, with my approval, is referring the question for the opinion of the A.I.O.C. Joint Board at its next meeting ( in a few days time). 4. There has so far been no demand to establish similar machinery for dealing with, applic tions from Indians and other British employees of the Company, and in the light of our experience to'date, neither Pattinson nor I consider it necessary to establish such machinery. 5. Regarding the treatment of men who refuse to wor or play Ca Canny, I have replied in my Bavinprarn Ho.6 dated 10th June 1S44, that Pattinson and I agree, that the only thing to do with them is to discharge them and replace them from home. 6. It seems to me however, that our inability to punish such men discloses a fundamental flaw in the Order in Council, which in effect, negatives all our efforts to administer the Order iustly, for there is little purpose in establishing a Consul's Committee to review applications for release, if disatisfied applicants, can flout the orders passed on the Committee's recommendation, by compelling the Comoany to discharge them. 7. Undoubtedly the great majority of Tien would be too cons cientious to adopt this procedure. It is apparent however that, the very existence of this escape route places a premium on conscience, moreover^ since the loopholes in the Order as it now stands, allow, on the one hand, the Company to dismiss / employees Bir Header /.

If the ministry of Labour cannot arree to this I sun est that it is for them to provide a solution to the problem of punishinr employees, who by yoinp Cd 1 Canny, com-jell the Company to discharge them. Yours sincerely, 3d. A.C. Jtewart.? CONglDEMTIAl Ho.C/1078. Political Agency y Bahrain, 18th July 1944. From T. B. Rogers, Esq., I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. t Sir, Subject: Proposal to rescind the Persian Gulf Regulation No.2 of 1942. I have the honour to refer to your printed letter No. 620-S dated the 23rd June 1944 and to report that I discussed this matter with Mr. Ward Anderson and Mr. H.B. Nichols (Vice- President of the Company) on 14th July. I set forth below what are more or less our agreed conclusions, which also sub stantially represent the views of Major T. Hickinbotham, C.I.E., O.B.E., with whom I discussed the matter before he left. Mr. Ward Anderson has asked me to send him a copy of this letter. I understand he intends forwarding it to his Head Office with any comments he may wish to add. 2. In general, it is not clear why a regulation which has so far rendered such useful service should be jettisoned largely for the reason that one or two ill-disposed employees (after not inconsiderable trouble to themselves and, perhaps, harm to their good name) have been able to evade it. Surely only evasion of the regulation on a considerable scale would justify rescinding the regulation on the grounds that it can be evaded. 3. Besides, the rescinding of the regulation may be expected to produce the following undesirable consequences:- (a) If we rescind the regulation now when, with the con struction work on a vital aviation petrol plant in full swing, the Company is obviously engaged on more important work than ever before, employees who have acquiesced so long in being prevented from joining the fighting services may rightly specu late whether our motives were sincere in introducing the/6 2 regulation when we did, at a time when the Company^ activities were (they may think) less vitally, and certainly less obviously, essential to the war effort than now. The original necessity for the imposition of the regulation will surely be seriously questioned. (b) It should be kept in mind also that there are probably a number of employees whose contracts are nearly completed who might be ohly too willing to take advantage of the rescinding of the regulation to leave Bahrain, not because they are keen to fight, but because they might feel they could not decently stay ; once the door to release had been opened. 4. It is also arguable that if the regulation were rescinded and, by implication, the Qompany no longer considered an f, undertaking essential for the prosecution of the war”, the Company might not expect to continue to receive the preferen* tial treatment which they have so far enjoyed in the matter of supplies and replacements of personnel. However, I do not press this argument since, though it is perhaps undesirable that the Company should be permitted to 'have things both ways*, I allow that it is feasible in practice to separate the two matters, i.e., to permit the Company to continue to enjoy priority in supply and personnel requirements and at the same time to remove restrictions on personnel desiring to leave their employ. 5. However, the.time for relaxing these restrictions does not yet seem to be at hand. The moment for such action would appear to be when, after perhaps six months further, the end of the war in the West is more clearly in sight and we may expect to see a widespread and urgent desire to return to their homes find expression among the employees of the Company. At the same time a considerable improvement in the man-power position might then be expected together with a more favourable transport situation which would enable the Company to benefit fully from the latter.6 3 6, In brief, I consider the question of whether to rescind the regulation or not should be judged more from the human than the legalistic standpoint. Men have been kept out here for years in trying circumstances largely through our appeal to their better feelings and by our giving them fiegulation 2 to show their friends in lieu of medals. It may be true that to continue the regulation puts something of a premium on con science (if there is widespread evasion, which there has not been at Awali). Nevertheless, I consider that the great majority of employees are content to go on doing their duty in the persuasion that their work is of vital importance to the war effort. It would be dangerous as well as unfair to take any action which might throw doubt on the validity of that persuasion. I do not think the action of a few scallywags in evading the regulation (and there seem to have been more at Abadan than at Aw^li) should allow us to take away yet the sop to conscience and self-respect which the regulation has supplied. I have the honour to be Sir Tour most obedient servant Political Agent, BahrainConfidential ^ 7 . Q No• 84-T British Consulate, Khorr&amp;mshshr, 21st June 1944* Bear Sir Reader Bullard, Please refer to my June 1944* 2* I have now been informed that the A.I.O.C. Joint Board (I will henceforth call it by its new name viz* Staff Consultative Committee) have expressed a wish that all applications for termination of en^loyment, whether approved or not by the management, should be referred to the Consul’s Committee. Furthermore, Mr. Pattison has informed me that he has receiveo precise instructions from London; firstly, that all applications for release must be referred to the Consul’s Committee. Secondly, in regard to recalcitrant staff, that each case is to be dealt with on its merits, and that ii , in consultation with the Consul, it is considered desirable that proceedings for prosecution in any case should be instituted, the individual concerned should be disposed of by the Consul. 3. I understand that Mr. Pattinson is taking steps to bring once again to the notice of his London office, the various difficulties in the way of implementing these instructions, ana, since the subject will doubtless be raised for discussion curing Your Excellency’s forthcoming visit tc London, I am taking this opportunity to reiterate the objections which occur to me • 4. Bealing firstly with the recalcitrant staff. These individuals fall under 3 heads; (1) Staff who refuse to work and demand to be sent home; '2) Staff who refuse to work and await the next move on the pact of the Consul or the Company; (3) Staff who continue to attend their work but go slow with the object of compelling the Company to discharge them. It is admitted that those who fall in class (1) can be prosecuted without difficulty. As regards class (2) it may be contended that these persons have in effect, left the service of the A.I.0.1ZI., nevertheless, until apply for travel facilities, no documentary evidence / can be ••••••• while volun tarily they actually To, His Excellency, Sir Reader W. Bullard, KCB. , KCMG., CIE. , His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador, British Embassy, Tehran .can be produced to pr/ove this* and it would be necessary for eviaence to be adduced in Court by witnesses in person* Alternately it is possible that the Consul could, under instructions from the Court, record evidence on commission* This would however, delay proceedings almost In theory it is also possible to argue that. Company no longer pay men who have ceased to inevitable that sooner or later they will be give documentary evidence of their desire to service, by applying to the Consul for travel indefinitely. since the work, it is compelled to leave its f acilities* I am doubtful whether in such a case their written application for travel facilities would in itself be sufficient, and whether it would not also be necessary to produce evidende, which could only be oral, that the man had ceased to work before the Company had ceased to pay him* Regarding those falling under head (3); even if evidence can be produced that the man was an unsatisfactory employee, he cannot be prosecuted and the only course open to the Conpany is to discharge him* b. Regarding the reference of all applications for release to the Consul’s Committee* Quite apart from the objections mentioned in paragraph 3 of my letter of 10th June, it seems to me, that until we dan devise a means to punish men who fall under categories (2) and (3) above, it would be unnecessarily publicising the weakness of the Order, if we require that all applications should be examined by a Committee, who, if they act conscientiously, must inevitably be inclined to recommend that the vast majority of these be rejected* If, on the other hand, the Committee is to be so guided that it deals leniently with applecations, I feel that it would not be long before acceptance became automatic, which surely, we ourselves can qo with more dignity and less trouble; keeping the Committee in reserve to deal with extreme cases* Yours sincerely, Sd* A*C* Stewart* No* 154-K Dated 21st June 1944 Copy forwarded with compliments to; H*M* Consul General, Ahwaz.

The conditions which you are imposing in your standard letter given to all Indian employees who are proceeding on leave and who are being offered continued employment on the expiration of their leave do not seem to me to be entirely fair. It means that you retain a lien on the individual^ services under Defence Regulation No.2 of 1942 but reserve to yourself the right to discharge him on the termination of his period of leave if he is physically unfit or if you no longer consider it to your advantage to re-employ him. This means that the individual concerned cannot make use of his period of leave to look for further employment in India or elsewhere and he may on the termination of his leave be informed that you are no longer in a position to offer him employment with the result that he may find himself somewhat unexpectedly without work and without pay. 3. Would it not be possible for the company to safeguard theiM interests by having the employee medically examined before he leaves Bahrain? It will also surely not be unreasonable t expect your Company to make a forecast of their requirements three months ahead. I suggest that in fairness to the employee the Company should make up its mind before the individual concerned leaves # Bahrain on vacation whether or not he is to be re-employed on the termination of his vacation.

All our Indian contract employees are medically examined just prior to departure from Bahrein but on many occasions in the past employees who have left here fit have been unable to pass our Recruit ing Agent 1 s medical officer on reporting for re-engagement formalities after vacation in India. The Company assumes responsibility for their employees’ medical treatment and industrial disability while in the Zone of Operations. It seems reasonable therefore that the Company should retain the right to make their offer of continued employment contingent upon the employee conforming with an established standard of physical fitnesss.

The matter has sin^e been under consideration both here and by the political authorities in the Gulf. The general conclusion is that it would be a mistake to rescind the Regulation at the present moment. There has not been evasion on any considerable scale) and the possible implication, if it were now rescinded, that the operations^of the Company were no longer considered as an undertaking essential for the prosecution of the war, might create an unfortunate effect.

The regulation provides among other things that The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited is specified as an undertaking essential for the prose cution of the war and that no British subject or British pro tected person may leave the Company's employment without the prior consent of the Political Resident or the Political Agent. reassured our employees that their continued stay at Bahrein was a contribution to the war effort and in those cases where an employee wished to leave, we were able to hold them until replacement could be obtained, the Company not requesting that a man be held against his wishes beyond the time required to obtain replacement.

However, we do not feel that the suspension of this regulation would materially affect the Company's manpov/er situation at this time. Accordingly, we would appreciate your consideration of requesting the Political Resident to suspend the provisions of the regulation.

I shall be glad to have your observations. It may well be desirable to rescind whole Regulation rather than amend it merely to exclude Bahrain. 3. N.F.P. also ask that views of Bahrain Petroleum Company should be obtained. It will no doubt be more convenient if Company could be approached at Bahrain in the first instance and if you see no objection I shall be glad if this could be done.

(b) The effect on the morale of the employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company.' (o) The probability that quite a number of employees might leave as soon as the Regulation was cancelled. The Bahrain Petroleum /r vompany requires quite a lot of supplies and to a certain extent personnel replacements^ from the United Kingdom and from India and if this Regu lation were rescinded I am doubtful whether they could ask for arid be given the profev'ential treatment which they now receive.

I pointed out that legally they w r ere in no way bound to state the reasons just as he was in now way bound to state his reasons if he had been the party giving the notice under that particular • clause. He said that he had continually asked for assistance which had not been forthcoming and that recently the catering system was threatened with a complete breakdown and he was giving notice, and three Americans had taken on today his w T ork with an additional 34 waiters. Mr. Middlemass said that he required the reasons for his contract being, cancelled in v . order that he might be able to get his old job back in South Africa. I fold him that I will speak to ^r. Nichols who was the present Chief Local Representative and see whether it will be possible for anything to be done and that I will let him know on Saturday. / 28-9-44. I have spoken to Mr. Nichols and he informed me that Mr. Middlemass seemed qi ite incapable of doing the work for which he w r as engaged and in fact he tendered his regignation verbally. He further states that arrangements were to send Mr. Middlemass to the United Kingdom but that the aforesaid gentleman changed his mind at the last moment and decided to go to South Africa. He maintains that Mr. Middlemass was fully acquainted with the nature of the work v/hich he was expected to do here but does not seem to have correctly under stood the conditions which prevailxd in Bahrain. It just happens that he was found to be not the type of man they wanted for the work.
