Owing to their draught large ships such as Men-of-war had restricted freedom of manoeuvre between the anchorage and the spherical light buoy to the south-east of Kassar Diwan rock.The usual procedure was to sound four short blasts to indicate that dhows and other small craft are to keep out of the way of the ship making this signal. A notice to this effect in English and Arabic was displayed, signed by Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, Adviser, Bahrain Government.A copy of the letter was sent to: Shaikh Said bin Maktum, Ruler of Dubai; Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Ruler of Sharjah; Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid, Ruler of Ajman; Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan bin Zayed, Ruler of Abu Dhabi; Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashid, Ruler of Um al Qaiwain; Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Ruler of Ras al-Khaimah; Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani, Ruler of Qatar; Khan Sahib Husain bin Hasan Amad, in charge of current duties of the Residency Agent, Sharjah. Correspondence includes the reply from Shaikh bin Qasim al Thani acknowledging receipt of the notice.Correspondents include, Captain V S Butler, Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf; Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch, Political Agent, Bahrain. Captain George Ashmead Cole, Officiating Political Agent, Bahrain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Marine navigation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002cc#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002cc#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002cc#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
