Ethyl-lead was required as a booster for petrol, and an India Office minute states that the erection of a plant outside the United States dollar curtain would save the United Kingdom millions of dollars a year.The papers include correspondence from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Associated Ethyl, and the Political Agent, Bahrain (Captain Hugh Dunstan Holwell Rance). The representatives of the Company anticipated difficulties in the construction of a plant in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, or Iran, and indicated that Kuwait was likely to be their preferred location.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Petrol</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Associated Octel Company Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00021f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00021f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
