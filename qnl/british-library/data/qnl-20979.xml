During tne sudoeeding three days ^he tribes and cara vans left, always passing in wiew of the Agency so that it could be seen that no goods were taken out. As a precaution in rlew of the large numbers inrolred a machine gun was placed on the Agency roof and subsequently a second waa counted. On the last days news was recelwed that the one remaining carawan vas ^.'■uggling out arma and ammunition concealed in their saddles and a guard of marines and blue Jackets was lanled and some of the oamels searched, but without suooeas. The turning away pa.aed off quietly and after waiting a short time to see if there was any chance of getting goods out by driblets the oarawane betook thcmselwes to Sin Sa'ud complaining bitterly. Considerable resentment was aroused in faji at. the time but died down owing to the aenaible attitude taVen un by-3- ( Bin oa'ud who now haa a properly accredited repre^entatire at Kuwait to Touch for hi 9 carayans. At the same tire In order to aToid the occupation of Kuwait it waa decided to try to settle the Kuwait problem by buying up all the stocVs held in Kuwait and to Unit iraporta in order to preyent th^ir being replaced. The effect of the action talren on April 11th was that on iiay 4th the Shaikh wrote a letter to the Political Acent begging that GoTermaent would extend to him the s-xre frl^niahip and protection aa his predecessors had receired ard -jledrinff himself to coraplete reaponsibility for anything which Jiirht take place in his territory, while a marked improTament took place in the general attitude of the Shaikh's Officials. The Shaikh's orertures were sabmitted to GoTemment but owing to some delay in their acceptance the Shaikh grew restive and the Political Agent waa authorised dm June 3rd to inform him that Govemment were giring his letter their friendly consideration and that it was hoped that Sir Percy Cox would deliver their reply on his return to ^©sopotamia. The purchases on behalf of GoTornment amount to:-» iiice ••••••••••••••• , 7 63 bags* /heat •••••••••••••• X,-040 M Barley 2,900 ' Jugar •••••••••••••• t5 Coffee ••••••••••••• 10,6»'5 Pepper ••••••••••••• 350 n Tea 1,658 cases* to a total yalue of K!.2^p^,94VlS/.. but purchasing was stopped on June 2nd at the express request of the Shaikh to the Deputy CiYil Oommissioner, Baoruh, and the Political Agent, as^personal concession to hlr.sftlf. It waa, howerer, found that such enormous orders were being placed in India and in other Gulf Porta to replace the stocks bought by^lOTernment that further action becare neoea- •ftpy and on June 12th the Shaikh waa informed that these jroods could not be allowed to land pending the reply of or^rnment to his letter and that the merchants could b&lt;5 ^Iren the option of shipping to Basrah under permit or selllntr to GoTernment at coat price plus fire per cent any rooie which the blockade Officer considered should not be landed at e Kuwait* On Juneirwnaawt ♦ . * ' L I ■ HI IJuno 26th tho 3.o« 'Zayanl' waa ordered to oreroarry her oar^o which Included more than 21,000 paoka*ea f ntoatly fooletuffs, for Kuwait# On June 24th the Political Agent represented that oooupa- tion was atill the only real solution of the Kuwait Question, but that if that were not feasible the Shailrh 'a offer raust be accepted at once as any capital we night hope to raake out of the acceptance would be lost by further delay: discontent was rife in the town among high and low and our failure to core to a dacision ^i^^u^to^the weakness of our position as regards the war* On June 38th the Governraent of India issued orders that the Shaikh's offer should be accepted on certain conditions, which decision was corrounicat®^ to the sHallrh in the litter njot^d at length hereafter, while exports from India to Kuwait were to be prohibited except on permits signed by the Political Apent or his aepresentatiwe and such executive action as possible was to be talcen to prevent exports to Kuwait from other ^ulf ports. The following statement of policy was made n While the Govemrrent of India appreciate the iesirability of checking trade with Kuwait they do not consider this of sufficient importance to justify the risk of an open breach with the Shaikh and the consequent necessity of military occupation with its possible far-reaching effect on other parts of Arabia', On July 5th the following letter (dated July 4th) *as handed to Shaikh 3alim by the Political Agent:- 'After compliments.

My watch having stopped I have now to go by the Mullah's which keeps Arabic time. Our total number of hours marching to-day was not more than 10^ miles. I judge our hamalat, or baggage camels, do no more than 2J to ^ 21 miles an hour. They go faster in the early morning, no doubt, but in the afternoon the pace becomes a crawl. To-day we seemed to be going more west i than usual our general direction being about 240°. Much colder in the early morning but grew pretty hot as day wore on. Strong north-west wind. AV hen we first saw the Shammar tents 2 Shammaris appeared riding from them; they turned out to be men who had hitherto been accompanying us but who had slipped away in the dark to visit their tents and, no doubt, give information about us. For, about 1J hours later, we heard shots in our rear and, shortly afterwards, Athar Barazi and a relative galloped up. They were a nice pair and were riding beautiful ponies, a grey and a chestnut about 14-2 hands. I made a remark about these animals afterwards to Duhaiman, our Shammar rajiq, and he told me that Ibn JRashid had got their dam, a famous mare, and was keeping her at his stud in Hail. When within about 7 hours of the wells of Al-Gara'a ( descended into a valley, dropping down somewhat steeply for the first J mile. Thenceforward we moved along stony valleys with sandstone bluffs on either hand about 180 to 200 ft. the valleys being about ^ to f mile broad. Sparse /shrub ; tufts of grass. Some hares were seen and chased. 'Ali al Dhuwaihi shot one running with his rifle and presented it to me. 17th October. —Owing to the broken At dawn.

The wells are situated at the head of a valley directly between and under some castle-like sandstone hills. We were 4 hours and 10 minutes on this day's march. Hamud (Athar Barazi's young brother), Turjim, Sahili ibn Khurairn, and Mauwar al Jansawi came with 5 other mounted men and had coffee. While receiving them the Shagrah caravan began to arrive under its Amir, 'Abdullah ibn Sadhan. He says that he met a very large Shammar caravan coming from Najd under Ibn Jabrin or belonging to that section of the Shammar. He thinks that they have in all probability been sent by Turki as their people are camped beyond Artawiyah. Hear at every place that Ibn Rashid is now in Teimah ; also that he is now deserted by most of the Shammar. The latter can get nothing from the Karbak»Xajaf-Shmawah line and are very hard put to it for food. All the Shammar say that they wish to take sides with us or, to put it in their own words, to come under the Government. My experience of the Arabs of the Shamiyah (i.e., desert south of the Euphrates) during the last 2 years or so all goes to show that their friendliness to the British is genuine. I think the Bedouins are traditionally pro-British. We have a great name among them for humanity, justice, and honesty. They always say that the Englishman is a man of his word. If he says &lt;f yes it is all right and if ' no he cannot be compelled to change his mind, though open to argument. The wells here are lined with stone for about 50 ft. I measured the distance to the water and found it exactly 50 yards (150 ft.). There were only about 4 ft. of water in the well (1 of 2 only). The water is brown, but with the clearness of a peat-burn and sweet, though almost tepid. The well's mouth is some feet above the general level rather like a volcanic lake iii diminutive. This shape :— The hachuring represents paths, of which there are 8 in all. Eight camels can work at the same time drawing water. The wells are said to be of the time of the Prophet; they are pretty sure to be that, if not older. The Mutair own and maintain them, but all Arabs use them. The distance from these wells (Al-Gara'a) to Al-Asafa is 4 hours. Everyone appears to be against our going to Artawiyah, which is said to be a hotbed of Muhammadan puritanism. Not only is the foreigner unwelcome, but all outsiders are put in quarantine for various periods until their orthod oxy is ascertained. It is proposed, therefore, to water next at Dujani or Gaiyiyah. One of our dullahsce, or water skin buckets, feli down the well. A boy was let down to fetch it up. I gave him a present of B 2. It was a risky business with a rope of uncertain breaking strain but the boy made no demur, getting iato an old leather bucket and being lowered,150 ft. to the water's edge. This morning was very coldi The camp was all asleep ; every living thing stretched out on the sandy scrub beneath the stars, except one camel hoppin'' about on 3 legs, the near fore being tied up to prevent her going far afield^ We have only riding camels {theluls) even for baggage and can move very rapidly in case of necessity.4 18th Halted for the day.

We had one or two very unreliable Sham mar rajiqs (friends) with us i and he feared further visits and demands from Barazi and his tribe who are now camped at the Al-Asafa. The Shagrah caravan was a bit worn out and would probably need a day's rest. I agreed. I think our Shammar Ibn Duhaiman, is a suspicious character, having caught him several times whispering or talking apart with the Barazi brothers. His joining us also was very odd. He came to us on our first march and asked what arrangements we had made for him. We said we knew nothing about him and told him to go to the Shaikh, He has never been satisfied since his arrival. Agreed with 'Abdul 'Aziz to shake him off on the first opportunity. Fahad al Dhafiri is an old man sent with me by the Shaikh. He is reli able, I think, and most cheery, always singing out the quaint phrase 'Shughal Taiyar', which, he says, he picked up from Colonel Knox when the latter was Political Agent here. We have some Salubis with us. Many things about them and most of all their regular features differentiate them from the Arabs. They may well be a remnant of one of the Crusaders as they themselves claim. Salib means 'cross' and the word Salubi can be easily understood to signify crusader. They are greatly despised by .the Arabs but have many privileges and can go every where without fear of being plundered. The Kuwait missionaries told 'me that the cross figures in their marriage ceremonies as one of the emblems or symbols used in the rites. Our Arabs would not water the Salubis' camels till I went to the well myself and persuaded them to do so. Heard from Barazi that the Turks have agents out buying camels from the Shammar and have already secured a large number. Ibn Rashid is ^arranging the purchase for them. Have heard of no Turkish or German officers about. f 19th October. —Started at dawn ; reached camp, a circular plain shut in by , 0 , „ low hills, after 8 hours' march. Marched Dutsrace—52 hours, miles. • , . , . over very rough, stony ground, crossing some water-courses, deeply scoured, apparently by floods. Water appears to flow north. Still cloudy. South breeze; very cool. The Shagrah caravan in 3- large squadrons followed us at about 3 miles' distance. Khudhayar, the 6-foot Zanzibar negro servant sent to look after me by the Shaikh of Muhammareh, had a swelling on his thumb. Had to operate with a penknife *, filled up with boracic and bandaged. After the pus came out Khudhayar had instant relief; hope he gets all right again soon. Last night he slept beside me, suspecting treachery on the part^of some Shammar guests of ours. This marching with a caravan is tiring, but it seems advisable, in view of our untrustworthy Shammar rajiqs, to stick to them till we reach the real dirah of the Mutair. 20th October, —Marched badly for about 9 hours, trying in vain to be slow enough for the Shagrah caravan to keen un Distance—61 hours, miles. ^ J° on -r. ± l ' dawn— temp.

His reply, which was polite and florid, amounted to this—that his camels were a rotten lot and in bad condition and that he intended halting at the first place where camel grazing was to be had. So I sent Mirshid on to look for a camp. He found a charming little hollow, with plenty of grass (nussi) for the horse. To-day, as yesterday, we are crossing the Summan, a stony, undulating tract of country! We seem to be moving through a succession of amphitheatres which have no apparent exits; mostly circular, with a diameter of 1 to 2 miles. Crossino' from one to another is rough going for camels. , I wonder that their feet stand it and I don't believe that any but the locally-bred beasts could.

Marched from 2-15 p.m . to 8-45 p.m . ; met small body of Shammars, taking goods to Artawiyah. They collided with us on our route at night and there was a lot of drawing rifles and very nearly a row until we separated.

The Dahanah has 7 ridges with intervening valleys of clay and mostly thickly covered with shrubs and grass. Came in sight of huge sandhills at dawn.' That on the right is called the mutawah (overseer). People are said to hear the echo of the pall to prayer by a ghostly mutawah there at dawn. Flies so bad that it is almost impossible to write. Started again at 3-15 p.m ., halted 40 minutes for food and prayers at sunset, and then on till 9 p.m. Ghunaim, our Mutair, had forgotten the way so we did not press onto the water. 23rd October.—At 5-30 a .m , just before daylight sent Ghunaim and Ibn Distance 95 hoar. 5 minutes. 260 miles.

The guides made Gaiyivah instead of Dujani as had been our intention. We found plenty of sheep. There are 20 wells, the water is cool and sweet—quite the best we have had since Sirrah. It is about 54 ft. from the surface to the water. Large flocks of sheep and some herds of camels were watering when we arrived. 'Alial Dhuwaihi brought mo coffee as usual shortly after arrival.

He wished to return to Gaiyiyah after supper but I declined to allow him to depart before the morning as the reason for his follow ing us up was not quite clear. Set sentries as about 10 days ago a caravan of Awadhim returning from the Haj were attacked by Ataibah robbers and 7 men .and some women murdered and some camels stolen.

Albatarah ( ) is the name of this series of wells which are sunk at intervals all along this deep depression, which becomes almost a gorge here with steep cliffs on either side, that on the north being about 180 ft. above the level of the valley.

The baggage camels came very slowly. Tbis steep place is called Attawaij ( gijb ). We waited for the camels for ^ an hour at the first well. There was a small garden attached to the well and a square cover exactly over it. The well was cut into the solid rock the water being about 18 ft. below the surface when we saw it, which was after many sheep had been w T atered. It was not more than 2 or 3 miles from Zilfi but we did not get to our camp between the 2 towns until ll -4i5 a.m., i.e., our progress was latterly at the rate of about a mile an hour. At 2-15 in the afternoon the Amir of Zilfi, by name Usman ibn Muhammad, who lives in the western town, came to call. We had sent on 2 riders to inform him of our arrival from the first well (Mirshid and * Abdullah al Dahabas went on). Usman is an old man, very gentle and polite in manner. He has invited us all to dinner. We halt to-morrow when 1 hope to see the 2 towns. The new town, which replaces that destroyed by Ibn Rashid some years back, is a quadrangle facing north with 5 towers connected by a curtain, the height of which is about 15 ft. The east and west sides have 3 square towers, in addition to the circular towers connecting them with north and south faces. We camped at a distance of about 700 yards from the east face of the new town. The old town is about 1| miles from the new one. The Amir has promised to take me over the old town to-morrow. There is a suburb lying very slightly west of north, about 3 miles from Zilfi, called Araiarah ( ). At 4-45 p.m . had coffee with the Amir in his house and afterwards took a photograph of the west side of new Zilfi. During coffee conversation turned on the question of passes. The Amir was understood to say that passes given by him had not been accepted at Kuwait. We explained that the reason was probably that his name had not been given us by Bin Saud as one of the Amirs qualified to grant passes in his name. Many of the principal merchants of Kuwait, he tells me, are from Qasim families who have migrated thither in recent generations. It seems that all the aristocracy of Kuwait, as well as the places like Zubair and Khamisiyah, are 'Najdis. New Zilfi is called Al-Aidah ( ) and old Zilfi Al-Balad ( ol'*JI ). 26th October. —Halted.

There aie here, as everywhere, a few of the Akhwan, sour-faced lellows wlio hate the jovial people of Kuwait almost more than they do the infidel. Had coffee in the afternoon with ' Ali al Dhuwaihi and a long chat with him. The gardens in the rocky clifts, each with its protecting tower and couple of armed men standing on guard, are the most distinctive feature of Zilfi. 2/ th October. —Halted. Had breakfast with the Amir in his garden about Hayiight—Temp. 60°, Bar. 3,280'. a mile behind new Zilfi. Saw well from which 4 camels were drawing waterabout 60 ft. from the land-level. The upkeep of this well and garden worked out at 100 dollars a month, so my host informed me. The local opinion of the present political situation is that Bin Sdud and Jbn Hashid have some sort of understanding though Bin Saud and the Mutair are on their guard agci^nst the 'Aiman, who would have been left completely in the lurch had not Sahm given them an asylum in his territories. This understanding is believed to be in the nature of a truce. Bin Saud may think that the Central Powers will he the eventual victors. He does not relish the idea of being driven out of Hasah should the Turks return, but, on the other liand, he believes that if we are victorious it ^ill not be long before we take control of all the Arab littoral 01 the Gulf, including Hasah. If the Entente Powers succeed Bin Saud will have to take a back seat as regards His Highness the King of the Hijaz and this would be a more bitter pill for him than even the loss of Hasah. He is, therefore, sticking bis toes into the ground; jealousy of the Sherif, jealousy of Kuwait, and religious and racial jealousy of our conquest of Mesopotamia are causing him to veer round. There is a revivalist Islam movement in Riadh and Artawiyah. How far Bin S dud and his father are countenancing it _ can only be guessed at; but he might find in it the weapon that he is looking for to get even with the Sherif. Bin Saud's hostility towards Shaikh Salim of Kuwait for harbouring the 'Ajman is a factor not to be lost sight of. Quite possibly Kuwait, which is the lover of Qasim, will prove an invaluable counterweight to any hostile combination in Najd. If Bin Saud should throw us over Kutvait could biing us into relations with the Sham mar and'Aj man and enable us to use them for our purposes. Bin Sdud complains that we harbour the '^jman, his enemies, whilst he, faithful to the letter and spirit of his agreement with us, will have nothing to do with our enemies. This is probably the line he will take with us. We should get him to take Hail if he wants an increase of allowances. The above reflections are the result of my talks with the Zilfi Amir, a man of great independence of character, who talks unusually Ireely about local politics. 28th October. — Started at 7-15 a.m ., reached the Nufudh in 20 minutes. About IJ hours from Zilfi reached 3 Distance—126 Lonr», so minutes, miles. patches of palms, 1 a largish garden. Middaylemp. 76, B. r . 3,380 . Naklii al Hamthiyah is its name. Water about 15 ft. below the surface drawn by small cattle. Another ^ hour or so further on came on 2 other gardens, the further being pretty large and protected by 3 towers. Water is so near the surface that, once established, the trees need no irrigation. I made out the water about 10 ft. below the surface. Water in all these gardens is fresh and plentiful. Halted at 11-30 a.m . Ibn Duhaiman again gave trouble, coming up to the place where the Ainir of Zilfi and I were seated on the ground with Mullah 'Abdul 1th, and putting down the shirt, drawers, and chafiyah I had given him. He said they were too small; meant for a boy, not for a man. The act done before the Amir of Zilfi was an impertinence and I told him so. He, therefore, began to abuse the Mullah and all concerned. I must get rid of him either at once or from Buraidah. Left our resting-place at 3-30 p.m . At about 4-45 p.m . passed 2 long valleys, that to the right called Saidaniyah and to the left Maarah near which is a road leading to 'Anaizah. Half an hour later we began to descend the Nufudh into a wide plain covered with shrubs. Here the Amir of Zilfi, who w r as guiding us, pointed out the landmarks; on the right, Burmah ( ^ )&gt; a dark hill of no great altitude but very conspicuous in the slight undulation. The plain in front of us they call the Mistawi ( ). The Mistawi is that long, level valley which runs south-east to near Iliadh on the western side of Jabal Tuwaiq. This is the quickest route to Riadh but is through the wilderness up to Sudus. We reached the foot of the Nufudh at 6 p.m . (just after sunset) when we alighted for prayers and coffee. Proceeded thence on level, with plenty of camel grazing, until 9-15 p.m . when we camped in a hollow. The Nufudh between Zilfi and Buraidah is very green with the shrub athar; plenty of grazing.8 29th 0(?/ofor.— Started at 6-15, daylight, and marched lill 9-30 a.m., , . M campinff on stony ground.

This s/iaib ( ) is called Abu Barqah ( ajj ,} J} ). Muhammad Ibn Rashid came here with his army when he con quered Qasim. We halted here at 10-30 a.m ., marched again at 2-46 p.m . until sunset, when we had our usual halt of 36 minutes, then on till 9-5 p.m ., and encamped in a charming little hollow in the Nufudh. Going was either over the level or among hummockg. At about hours before sunset we came upon a deepish depression, running, where we entered it, about due N. and S. Here were a long string of villages and walled gardens, which we perceived as we climbed the opposite hill. Sandhills, or Nufudh, extended as far as the eye could reach in both directions. The village we descended into is called Shima- siyah. We watered our camels at a conduit of water drawn from a well about 70 to 75 ft. deep. An excellent photo of this well is given at plate LX in the ' Handbook of Arabia volume I, and is mentioned by Raunkiaer in his book 'Across Wahibiland on camel back '. The water was sweet but luke-&gt; warm. The descent into this long valley is steep and rocky on the eastern, or Zilfi, side and equally steep, though soft and sandy, on the western slope, 30t/i October. —Started at about 7 a.m . after sunrise, sending on 2 Distance—343 mile.. rid ? rS , t0 ^j Bin ,&lt;* Our At daicn —Temp. 70°, Bar. 3,230'.- arrival. When withm a mile of the fort, or qasr, of Buraidah we were met by a troop of horse under Abbas ' Beg'. They came up at a gallop while we halted on our camels, and gave us a display of horsemanship, letting off their rifles and curvetting round us. Their mounts looked well, but were small, few of them more than 13-3 in height. A spare horse was brought forme, but I had my own animal. We rode through the town gates and then into the fort, which is an imposing structure standing on high ground. It has 6 square towers and is machicolated. We dismounted and were led up 3 flights of mud stairs to a room about 30 ft. long and 16 ft. broad with roof of rough ithal beams. The floor was deep, soft sand. As I entered, Turki Bin S6ud walked quickly towards me, shook hands, and spoke very cordially, asking the usual questions about our health in a cordial manner. He took me to a seat at the head of the hall—a sort of double seat with a window behind—through which armed men kept watch. He placed me on his left, and tea, followed by coffee, was served. We conversed about the general situation, he telling me that Ibn Rashid was now in Madinah with Fakhri Pasha and Ibn Lailah at Damascus with Jamal Pasha. He enquired after news of the dear Government (British) and I was able to tell him that on the day of my arrival at Baghdad (30th September) we had gained a nice victory over the Turks at Ramadi, taking 3,000 odd prisoners and 12 guns. I told him how the Turks were caught and obliged to surrender, the commander being one Ahmad Beg, He told me that all was peace at present on these borders. He gave me a letter from his father, Bin Sdud, in which the latter said he was very busy in Riadh at present, but would like to see me there, when it suited my convenience. My reception was extraordinarily good. I was offered a house in the town or tents outside, choosing the latter as that arrangement pleased them most. They pitched 2 large tents for the men and 1 smaller, but higher, red tent for me. Abbas ' Beg' conducted me back to my camp after our reception at the Palace I riding back to camp on Turki's mare. Our camp was on sand near a clump , of ithal outside the N. E. face of the Buraidah town wall, which is about a mile long with walls about 15 feet high, and a great fort about the centre of the walls with a tower at each corner and one in the centre. A large watch-tower is a conspicuous object in the rear face. Turki has a thin, pale face of a sort of old ivory colour and smoothness - black eyes, sftall, but not set too close together; about 5' 8' in height. Intelli gent and brave, I should say, and a man fond of honour and with a penchant for higher ideals but somewhat effeminate, with the Inevitable stamp of the favourite son. His face narrow, general expression pleasing, boyish, rather* 9 tender. He has a look of his father, but is of quite a different build, being light and rather fragile. I asked him about his grand father, Abdur Kahman's, health and learnt that he was well. 31st October^ Buraidah. —Turki came at about 8-15 a m , accompanied by the Governor of the town, 'Abdul Aziz bin Jalawi ( yji ), and Abbas al Falaji ( ), commonly referred to as Abbas 'Beg', fading about lOO horsemen, mostly African slaves. Before coming to the camp they galloped past me as I stood by a tent peg, firi r g rifles and revolvers, waving swords, and looking very warlike. I pretended to be duly impressed with this childish fantasia, which was intended as a special honour to me. Afterwards we had a mejlis in a large reception tent which Turki had had pitched for us. Tea, coffee, and biscuits were partaken of and then Turki, with the abovementioncd personages, adjourned with me to my private tent to discuss business. Ibn Rashid is at present in Madinah with Fakhri Pasha, while Ibn Laiiah is at Damascus wfth Jamal Pasha. Turki says Ibn Rashid has only about 400 men with him, but can always assemble the Shammar in case of urgent need and it is not possible to take Hail by a coup de main. The two main questions which I had to put to Turki were :—(1) why he gave the Shammar caravan a letter to Shaikh Salim for musahilah at the end of September, and (2) if it were possible for him to take Hail at this time when Ibn Rashid is obviously so weak. As regards (1) Turki says he only gave the Shammar a slip of paper addressed to all and sundry intended to be for a safe conduct among his tribes lest they should interfere with or attack them. He nover meant to give them a pass for mmabilah on the way to Kuwait. As for (2) capturing Hail he said that, in the first place, it w r ould not be possible to gather his powers rapidly enough to take Ibn Rashid by surprise, and, secondly, he knew that there, was one vi lage or suburb of Hail which was strongly fortified and garrisoned by the Turks. His orders from his father were to seduce the Shammar and prevent them returning to Ibn Rasbid while keeping the Mutair from raiding tribes which had sent quotas to fight under the Sherif. Neither answer is really satisfying. The fact is that an informal truce exists among the tribes of both parties. Bin Saud's policy is evidently approved of by all. The Bedouin's one idea at the present moment is to share in the rich harvest of British subsidies and the profits of blockade-running. 1st November. —Rode in early morning to S. W. of city through palm gardens ancT on our wav home had coffee with one ^ 3,3.5'. Ibn Babush. I offered to go and call on Turki to take my leave, but received a message from him requesting me to stay in camp until the afternoon, when he would himself come and start me on my way. Waited till 4 p.m ., when he came out with all his horse, including the Governor, 'Abdul 'Aziz bin Jaluwi, the Arafah (Salman), and another. Was very pleasant and rode with me for J mile, when he requested leave to return. He said he had just received word from his father sanctioning his return to Riadh as soon as he could be relieved by Fahad ibn Maamar, the former Governor. I am glad I did not meet that surly individual *. Buraidah people struck ^ ' me, however, as not unfriendly; on the contrary, they appeared glad to see me and were more frank than the Zilfis,. Nevertheless, I hear from.my entourage that they are really inclined to be fanatical, though the palm for fanaticism must now be given to Artawiyah, where all the elect have migrated. Buraidah bazaars are most disappointing. The place struck me as under some evil spell and as most unprogressive, badly built, dirty, and generally uncared for. The inhabit ants have no great love for Bin Sdud or for Hail either. Marched till 8-25 p.m ., crossed the Wadi Rummah at about 7-55 p.m ., and seemed to be continuously in the vicinity of date gardens till the last 2 miles. Halted on the height overlooking 'Anaizah. 2nd November. —Descended to lower ground by a stony, but not very steep, TA . - . ^ path and was met by the nephew of the istauce 360 mxies. Amir and 2 messengers. It appears that I 46 f. &amp; p. d.was expected yesterday and that the Amir and principal people had ridden to the outskirts to meet me and stayed there till midday. 1 apologized, explaining that my detention was due entirely to Turki's asking me to wait. Had breakfast with 'Abdullahal Khalid al 'Abdullah, who succeeded his uncle 'Abdul ^zizal 'Abdullah this year. Had coffee and tea at houses of 'Abdul 'Aziz al 'Abdullah, Al-Hamad, Abdur Rahman ibn 'Abdul *Aziz bin Zamil, all of the Beni Salaim, a most courteous and refined family. They seemed to be men of the world, more enlightened and civilized than any Arabs I have met, and with a charming frankness and independence of manner. They are ideal hosts. 'Abdullah ibn Idris met me on the way. He had just come from the Sherif's son, Faisal, at Ak ibah. 'Abdul 'Aziz bin Hassun tells me he was present with Shakespear at tlie fight at Jarab, where he was wounded with a sword on the shoulder and left for dead. He was eventually picked up by some of Bin Sand's men and carried in 2 days tna Artawiyah to Zilfi. When sufficiently, recovered, he joined the Sherif who at that time was on the side of the Turks. After the Sherif had cast off the Turks, our friend continued in his service. He spoke a lot about Lawrence with Faisal at Akabah and said he was almost like a Bedouin—all tLe tribes knew him. Najdis were all called Agaili down south and received pay from the Sherif at the rate of £ 6 a month. Those employed on ' dynamite ' operations for destroying the railway got £15 per mensem. At least 1,00^ men, he said, have gone from here to assist the Sherif and about 4,000 from Qasim have gone also to the Hijaz to earn pay. News is that Ibn Rashid left Madinah and went to Al-Hijr. I do not al together agree with the 'Handbook of Arabia' regarding its comparison between Buraidah and 'Anaizah. 'Anaizah is a handsomely built town. The aristocracy are mostly related and very united. Thtir corporate life is like that of a mediaeval Italian republic, with their elective Amir chosen from the princely house of Bin Salain. Buraidah is larger if the environs and suburbs are taken into account and is, perhaps, more populous. My own belief is that 'Anaizah Las at least an equal settled population and its bazaars are infinitely better in every way, the shops larger, better stocked and kept. As for the people there is no comparison ; the people of 'Anaizah are by comparison highly civilized. The best of them have travelled at least to Kuwait, Bahrain, Basrah, Karachi, and Bombay, while many of them have gone far afield to the west and are acquainted with Damascus, Beirut, and Constantinople. Gave all my party 10 dollars each to spend in 'Anaizah. The Amir invited us all to lunch and dinner. Our Bedouins ate enormously, the food being excellent. The Amir has been very good to us. Feeling in 'Anaizah is, I think, strongly for us. After dinner, at 5 p. m ., we walked in the bazaars. I saw nothing worth buying, but was again struck with the picturesque and truly imposing architecture of the palazzos of the great ones, with their adjacent gardens all highly cultivated, the walls being covered with vines and surrounded by fig trees, pomegranates, peaches, etc. Some of the gardens looked as though they would afford delightful retreats in sullry weather. On the whole, 'Anaizah is a place to rave about when you come in from the desert. It is quite unspoilt by contact with modernism. I should say there were no paupers ; I saw no signs of squalor. The state of civilization of 'Anaizah shows that the Arab, even when left entirely to himself and almost isolated from the world of progress, does not altogether let himself go, but retains some ideals and aspirations. He doe&amp; not become brutalized or insensible to the amenities of life and social intercourse or, generally, to the softening influences of comfort and elegance. Some of the rooms of the houses I was shown through were beautiful. One, a coffee-room of 'Abdul 'Aziz, the retired Amir, was particularly artistic. It was about 18 ft. broad and '60 ft. long. Round the room were open corridors and the room itself had a gallery, with a grille under the roof, a sort of promenade for the ladies who come to see and hear what goes on in the coffee-hall below. Some texts from the Quran were artistically painted on the walls on rough mouldings ; in the luminous gloom the effect was very pleasant if bizarre. The utter absence of symmetry, or line, rather offends the European's eye but these interiors fascinated me and, after all, any attempt at symmetry would havebeen out of keeping with the general outside and inside designs. I never saw a plumb line outside or inside nor any striving after balancing or matching things. 'Aoaizah is like a gem roughly cut by the hands of some barbarian workman ; yet the result is such that one would on no account have the gem recut in modern fashion even were that possible. Abdullah al Hamad came after sunset to bid me good-bye. He is a nice fellow 3rd November, —Marched at 6-55 a. m . and halted at 10-5 a . m . Sent on Mutlaq al Naimi (Mutair, sent by Turki) Distance 146 hours, 10 minutes, mile.. ^ Muhammad ibn DahabaS, to convey a letter to the Shaikh of Mudhnib, Fahad Agaili, informing him of our intended arrival at the town to-morrow at daylight. Our general direction to-day was S. S. E. over hard ground, stony, with very little vegetation for the most part ; our landmarks, two cliffs on the right of the road, from which it is said to descend direct on to the palms of Al-Mudh nib. Prom our halting-place through a gap on the left of the road to Mudhnib (N. E.) saw a depression with palms which are said to be Aziziyah village. Last night c Ali al Dhuwaihi, who is continuing along with us to Eiadh, said he had high fever and might not be able to start next day. He had, however, recovered sufficiently to travel to-rlay. We are taking it pretty easy and the weather is delightfully fresh. Started at 2-55 p. m . and pulled up at 4-55 p. m . as we did not wish to reach Mudhnib before morning. We got to within about 2 hours' distance of Al-Mudhnib and camped in a hollow with sparse arfaj and other grazing shrubs for camels. 4th November. —Started at 3-10' a. m . and got to a place near Mudhnib marching still over undulating, stony ,miCS ' giouud ; waited for sunrise and then started to town and met 2 riders sent out by the Amir to meet us. We went to his place and there had tea and coffee. The coffee-hall was a long, darkish room with a large firepit at one end, in which stood 8 or 9 large coffee-pots. As usual, plenty of carpets and a cushioned corner to the right of the hearth looking down the hall. Con versation for about an hour, and then went off to our camp to dress and wash. Some talk about Shakespear, who passed through here in the spring of 1912 when returning from Kiadh. The Amir tells me that Bin Saud makes this a regular halt when passing backwards and forwards to Qasim. The route by the Mistawi is more even going and better for camels as far as grazing is concerned, but this way ' through the villages as they say, is nearer and has the great advantage of plenty of water at short stages, and supplies. But if I return I shall go by the Mistawi. One marches better in the desert ; these villages lead to lounging and general carelessness in one's followers. As for safety there is not much to choose between the two for a small party. A large party, say of 20 riders, would, however, be absolutely safe by this route and not so by the desert way. Tribes have to be feared on the Mistawi and robbers in Woshm. Mudhnib is more like an 'Indian village than an Arab one. The soil is all clay and absolutely flat ; there is no trace of sand anywhere. Large standing fields of millet and barley ; gardens scattered around. The village is not fortified but has a single qasr. I am told that they have no enemies to fear. Over 100 of the inhabitants have gone to the Hijaz to iake service under the Sherif. Eahad ibn 'Abdul Karim is a charming personality. He is about 40 years of age, has been 25 years Amir of the place, succeeding his father as a lad of 15. He has never travelled. There are 30 houses of Agail, mostly Beni Tamim stock. One fort in town ; villages surround the town to a distance of 2 miles. The population under 3,000. I offered the Amir a present of a smart aba and 70 dollars, but he absolutely refused to take anything, saying that as the faithful servant of Bin Saud he could not do so without the latter's permission. This is unusual, I think, as both the Amir of Zilfi and Abbas al Ealaji accepted the 70 dollars which I gave them. I forgot, perhaps, to mention that the whole party with me, including men from Kuwait aad12 i Muhammareh and from Turki, received 10 dollars each as pocket money to spend in Qasim. ibc chief peculiarity of Al-Mudhnib is the absolute flatness of the plain on which it is built. ^ Stony cliffs enclose the depression ; its apparent openness to attack ou all sides is also a noticeable feature. The inhabitants answered my Salaam-Alaikum ' (^xLc ) smilingly. I observed no surliness, but this is due to the fact that I am passing through the country as the honoured guest of Bin Saud and accompanied by his special messengers, Bami al Bair ( and Sa'ad Ajmi. v ' ' riie water of this place is salty and aperitive. No one drinks except from one w ell at Qasr Ibn Saud. That water, which is about 45 ft. below the surface, is really good and sweet ; the best we have drunk since leaving Kuwait. ® Left at 1-25 in the afternoon, and halted for ^ hour at Qasr Ibn Saud, which is | hour's march from the town (about li miles). We reached Murabbah (g/*) at 5-10 p. m. November. —Left camp at 5 a. m . and came within sight of Ainas Dutance —161 hours, so minutes, 417 miles.

Kasr al Wuthailan ( .U j JJI r ^») (small itJial bushes) a little further on. ^ J ^ K Started again at 1 p. m ., having sent on Thami and Mirshid to inform the Amir, Dakhilullah, of our arrival before sunset. Reached Ain al Juraifah at about 4-40 p.m . A horseman came out to welcome us. We rode in with him to the village coffee-room, just inside the fort gate, which faces north. This is a compact fortified village with severaf 2-storied houses and numerous square towers, all new looking and loopholed. There is a palm garden with about 100 palms watered by the springs which flow through it coming along on an underground channel from a distance of about 1J mifes b. E. of the village. Outside and north of the garden the water fills a ditch with an easy slope in which camels are watered. While here our own camels and those ^ of the Shagrah caravan were watering and splashing about in the ordlike ditch. Had coffee and tea and then went to the Amir's house and bad dates, with milk and ghee. Afterwards visited gardens. Dined with the Amir in his house; usual boiled mutton and impure water. ^A-li al Dhuwaihi who had been fasting all day, silly old man, now ate too much. He and 1 are always placed side by side. 6th November.—Leit about sunrise, 6-15 a.m . Marched first through the Distanca— 169 hours, 25 minutes, miles. Aln CS Sirrah depression to foot of Temp. 5G , Bar. 3,250'. Nufudh, which we reached after about U liours march. First f hour marched S. S. E. along the line of the springs. After hours marching passed Ain ibn Sakran (water from springs and extensive gardens). Halted at 10-25 a.m . in Nufudh ; very hot. The temperature this morning down to 56°. Heard story of Bin Sand's treachery towards, and defeat by, the Ajman. Salman al Arafah whom I met at Buraidah was with the 'Airnan at the time. Bm S^ud had sent 2 men to the 'Ajman in the afternoon to make a truce till morning, but was overpersuaded by Ibn Jaluwi and his brother, Said, to attack at dusk. Left at 2 in the afternoon and reached hollow in sands at sundown. 'Abdul 'Aziz ibn Hassun cheeky ; went to strike my pony for trvinff to roli dates. Told him to drop it and let pony alone. 8th Novemher. —Started at 6 a. m ., marched till 9 a. m . Had coffee. Left Nufudh in 20 minutes and then came on hard, black, stony ridge, crossed stony plain till 1-55 p. m ., when we re-entered red Nufudh. Good water at 18-ft. well Distance —177 hours, 50 minutes, miles. called Bir as Sali (^JL«Ji^ju). Sent 3 men off , _. . „ . , „ to fetch J dozen 'skinfuls of it. Halted at 10-40 a.m . for breakfast. Started at 1-20 p.m ., left Nufudh at 1-30 in the after noon, and passed through a stony plain and depression out of w r hich rose | c l 0 ^ en detached stonehills of the shape of a round cake. From the summit of13 the plateau above the depression we looked down to Shagrah and Shaijar, which latter lies about 3 miles north of our road. Shaijar is a larger town than Mudhnib. Beyond Shaijar we saw the ruddy Nufudh and further back the chalklike cliffs of Jabal Tuwaiq. We halted at 5-25 p. m . (sunset), having sent on Thami al Bail* and 'Ali al Dhuwaihi with a letter to the Amir, Muhammad Bin Saud, Al-Lsa. He has been appointed Amir by Bin Saud. He is a man about 45 years old. Came to our tents and brought us off to a good breakfast. Was very hot against the 'Ajman who, he said, were treacherous ; why, he asked, did Ibn Sabah and the British Government harbour them ? Bin Saud, he told us, claims overlordship over Arabia as far as Najran, including Qasim, Hasah, Mekka, Kuwait, and Oman. The Shagrah market is small, like that of Zilfi, but it is a larger town, surrounded by gardens. It has been well described as a lesser 'Anaizah. The Amir told us there were large townships in Woshm. Wushaiqir and Shaijar are one and the same ; the name is only a diminutive of Shagrah, of which it is an offshoot. Yesterday had some trouble with * Abdul 'Aziz bin Hassun, who tries to thwart me when he can do so safely. I had caught him the previous day twice chasing my pony away vindictively, following him with a stick and swearing. He began to argue till told roughly to let the horse alone. Now he wants to get even and has been giving a lot of trouble in other ways. I had to give him a severe dressing-down. 9th November. — Marched into Shagrah at about 7-10 a.m . A horseman Distnuce—180 hours, 35 minutes, 469 miles. Was SOnt OUt to meet US. Breakfast with Twup. 5* 0 , bar. 3 ,soo'. the Amir. Camped in open north-east of the town in sand. Mullah thinks that Shagrah contains more than 5 to 6 thou sand inhabitants. He says it is about f or | the size of 'Anaizah and con siders the population to be as high as 15,000. Putting 'Anaizah at an outside figure of 12,000 I should say there might be 8,000 souls in Shagrah. Had dinner as about 2-40 p. m . with the Amir and then departed, catching up the baggage about f hour later. After leaving Shagnh climbed up the rocky side of the depression and, stopping at the top and looking back with binoculars, had a good view over Shagrah, which lies very low. It is not more than J the size of 'Anaizah. Has 5,000 to 6,000 inhabitants possibly. Rode on to within sight of palms of Tharmidah and halted at sunset, 5-25 p. m ., in open patch, putting up some gazelles and a pair of bustard, which Amar tried to stalk ; ground hard, country all alrmg Nufudh level, loam plain and covered with fortified granges, looking like castles and called qaars (castles). 10th November. —Started at 7 a. m , and rode straight into Tharmidah, Distance—184 hours, 35 minutes, 484 miles. having sent Thami and Sa'ad on a head to Temp. 68°, Bar. 3,335'. warn the Amir, 'Abdul Rahman al Angari, who, it seems, formerly resided at Kuwait. His first cousin was the Amir of Tharmidah when it held out against Bin Sdud who besieged it. The cousin was put to death for his resistance. Gardens of Tharmidah delightful; water in wells 60 ft. below surface. Saw 2 wells, one with 9 and one with 10 buckets, working; each waterskin drawn by bullock, cow, or donkey, with a short, steep run down on both sides. Wells here mostly worked by -cattle during hours of day only. Some few wells worked by camels as in Qasim. Plenty of maize and bajra (Dukhan) and $,ux ; some lime trees, melons, pumpkins, and vegetables grow in profusion; air delightful; people look very much of the cultivating class and are said to bo mostly Beni Tamim. Outside walls in ruins. At the Amir, 'Abdul Rahman's, house had coffee, tea, and dates and then went and spent an hour or two looking at wells and chatting in gardens with Mullah 'Abdullah, Amar, and Thami. Thami has had 12 wives; all, except 2, he says, were girls, the other 2 being grown women. He did not keep any of them long. The lad who was with us was the Amir's servant; very poor; said his only chance of getting a woman was to go on a raid with Bin Sdud. Otherwise, he would remain a poor, wifeless wretch to the end of his days. The Amir is a man about 50 years old and a regular type of townbred Arab, most friendly. There seem to be a good many of the Akhwan about here. My ' Salaam-Alaiks ' were not infrequently ignored. 46 f. &amp; p. d.ni * 14 There has been some hot air in camp ; 'Ali al Dhuwaihi has been growling against 'Abdul 'Aziz Bin Hassan and the latter and the Mullah are not on good terms. Thami al Bair shouted out the call to prayers and led the crowd but' Ali al Dhuwaihi, who was praying with them, went off hurriedly at the end, saying, in the hearing of all, ' I don't want any more of this The fact is that Thami is the biggest rip in these parts and he bungled the call to prayers badly. Mirshid went up to him and gave him a lesson ; very funny. And Thami said 'All right, it did not matter. All the crowd hate and ridicule the Akhwan. I must get a clear account of their tenets. Last night an interesting conversation with Thami al Bair and Mirshid ; 2 Shammaris who were retainers of 'Abdul 'Aziz, Shaikh of the Shammar, when they marched victoriously through the towns of Woshm and Sudair. I asked them if Bin Saud could ' take Hail with guns—Thami said ' Do you want the truth ?—yes; well, every mother's son of us Shammar would come back and help to defend Hail—and 'Abdul 'Aziz, with all his talk and his thousands of tribesmen, would never get near the place'. Mirshid said with a laugh ' Last year Bin Saud had 7,000 men and there were only 1 ,000 Shammar with Ibn Rashid, but Bin Sdud did not dare to attack Hail and withdrew'. Left Tharmidah in the afternoon at 1-25 and marched along parallel to -Nufudh among many fortified farms, some of which look rather dilapidated. Cultivation by rain and wells sunk within the forts. Occupied from December onwards, till harvest is gathered. Camp near Nufudh at sunset^ 5-25 p. m . There has been a lot of hot air about in camp lately. We are all a bit travel-weary and irritable. 'Ali al Dhuwaihi is angry with 'Abdul 'Aziz because he won't give him a riding camel and with me because I only gave him 5 dollars at Buraidah. Mullah 'Abdullah is very wroth with 'Abdul 'Aziz, who is far from being popular all round. It was a delightful night and not too cold. 11th iVovmfor—Started at 5-25, about ^ hour before daybreak, and rode hard to Barrah, which I reached in under 3 Distance -187 ho,.. S5, minute,, 516 unUs. ^ baggage took exactl y (J t 0im to cover the distance, which I estimated was about 18 miles, not less. This is the best that the baggage have done yet, their usual all-round pace being about 2| miles. When pressed, however, 4 or 41 is not hard for them to do for 2 or '6 hours. Had coffee with the Amir of Barrah and coffee with the ex-Amir, who was disgraced and dismissed for taking the part of Ibn Rashid in the struggle with Bin Saud. All the village came in after coffee. Afterwards ate pancakes and butter; then, after coffefe at the ex-Amir's house, went to camp and had lunch consisting of a cold bustard shot by Amar yesterday with his *303 rifle. A jolly good shot, hitting the bird in the head. The last time I saw the like was last winter on the way to Jaharah when Ahmad al Jabir shot a dove through the neck at 50 yards with a Mauser. Fa had al Dhafiri and Katlan Mutair came to have sore eyes washed. The other Fahad, whose eyes were really bad, got quite well after 2 operations. An inquisitive group of villagers came to ask me if I knew anything about the Sahul. I told them all there ^as in the ' Handbook of Arabia,'* which was more than they themselves had any knowledge of. They were greatly im pressed. Was asked to-day whether it was true that the Daula (the Government, jneaning the Ottoman Government) had been beaten out of the field by us— told them we had got hold of Basrah and Baghdad up to Hit. ' Good-good the old man said. The Amir, calling round to my tent to ask me to coffee, suddenly said ' I wished to greet you before but was afraid the Muhammadans mi^ht object and, raising my chafiyah, he kissed me on both cheeks—I was utterly taken by surprise and could only say ' God preserve you There are some very remarkable landmarks to be seen from Barrah village. There are cliffs of Jabal Tuwaiq. The bearings from outside the Amir's house were :— Attahinah ..... . 300° ( ). Khashm al Hassan ..... 5° ( ). Khashm al Tarab . . . . . 10° ( )• Al-Rahhab 85° ( )• Al.-Qaradan . • . . 170° (). f15 v ■» 12th November. —Left Barrah at 6 a. m ., marched to bluff on left of road ^ and entrance into long valley, which is Distance— 19o hours, 35 miuutes, miles. , . _ , j i -i. i.u rri,,* t k 9 o tjo . a . 4,in' about 5 miles broad at its moutn. Inis shai'b has a torrent bed with trees on both sides ; it narrows to about 500 yards higher up ; then an ascent of about 200 ft. to watershed and descent into Wad Haisiyah, where I saw the largest trees I have yet come across in Arabia. Some of them attained a height of 25 to 30 ft. We halted at 11 a.m . for 3 J hours and reached our camping place on the Sudus road at sunset, 5-30 p.m . A good talk with 'Abdul 'Aziz, and think I have straightened him up. No grazing between Barrah and the head of Wadi Hauifah. The Haisiyah Shaib has steep, clifflike sides. I saw only one path across them to the right and one on the left. These were mere sheep tracks impossible for loaded camels. Saw some small partridges in rocks. After crossing the watershed we came on to a long plain, ending in the head of Wadi Hanifah. Here, too, begin the extensive and imposing ruins of Al-Aiyainah (). This old town was about 2| miles long. The torrent banks are revetted with stone masonry, without mortar, roughly dressed. Many wells, much like those of to-day but with no water in them. At Al-J ubailah ( ) is a mud village among the ruins of the old town but the only inhabitant appeared to be an old negro who has a house and a patch of cultivation there. He looks after travellers and is, I think, a guard of Bin Saud's. 12th November. —Started at 6-15 a.m . and halted at 11 a.m . by some trees at the ruined village of Al -Jubailah Distance 204hours, 20 minntes, miles. ^ above). There Was OUC Well above this ; here there are two, one of which is at the foot of the ruined village. The water at Al-Aiyainah (one well), is at a depth of 96 ft, at Al-Jubailah 84 ft., at Daraiyah 72 ft., at Jliadh 84 ft., and at Barrah about 48 ft. The negro told me that 'Abdul 'Aziz Bin Saud and his escort rode here in 12^ hours from Eiadh 2 months ago. The cemetery at Al-Jubailah is very extraordinary ; the graves are exposed on the side of the Wadi by diluvion action. ^ These graves are said to be those of the companions or of the followers of Khalid ibn Walid and other worthies of early Muhammadan times. Plenty of wood-cutters with their camels on the Wadi of Hanifah ; each camelload fetches in Riadh IJ or 2 dollars. To-day I rode more or less all the time with the baggage, but yesterday afternoon went off with Sa'ad ('Ajman) Amar, the Mullah, and Fahad Dhafiri. We set up a target, after some private camel-racing in which my camel, usually by far the fleetest, did not distinguish herself greatly. She is a bit tired out I think. The baggage thought we were being attacked and sent on all their riders to help us. Nights very windless ; the days much the same. Only two or three cloudy nights since we left and never one with wind ; always slept in the open. 'Abdul 'Aziz bin Hassun complained. This led to a big row ('Abdul 'Aziz's last fight for independence—since then he has been a lamb). Continued march down Wadi Hanifah. The wctdi, as it is familiarly called in these parts, is said to rise behind the village of Awainib and Al- Garadan {see 11th November, page 14, ante), a scarp which stands out very promi nently almost due south of Barrah village ( ). Awainib is the fortiiied village'which we passed on our right about 2 miles out from Barrah. I could not make out exactly where Haisiyah ends and where Hanifah begins, but I think it is somewhere in the vicinity of Aiyainah. to the nortli-^est oi the iiiins. Beached Daraiyah about J hour before sunset with J dozen riders and found plenty of lucerne and wood, also, later, some milk and eggs collected by Saud and Ibn Dahibas, who had been sent on ahead. Met a lad about 12 years of a^e of the As-9aud family who came down to our camp-fire on the loadi bed to chat with us. His name is Hadlilul ( ) ,and he belongs to the AI- Jaluwi branch. ISth Started at 6-5 A. m . and reached the outskirts of Riadh at 8-45 a. m . We were met 2 miles out of Distance- 207 hours, 583 mile*. B-iadh at a large tree by 'Abdul 'Aziz ibn xcmp. 5s 0 , Bar. siqc. Rabayi and 5 horsemen who gave us thevisual exihibition of horsemanship but without letting off rifles. One of them fell off. Reached Riadh ; met at Palace gates and conducted to mejlis wher e all the principal Shaikhs assembled. Sat on right of 'Abdul 'Aziz Bin Sand. The whole length of the top wall was unoccupied except by two of us ; then Muhammad ibn 'Abdur Rahman, 'Abdul 'Aziz's brother, an extremely influential man in Najd, Faisal ibn Rashid (refugee from Hail), Mullah 'Abdullah, my reader, Salih al Adil, Ibrahim ibn Muhammad bin Saif (of Kuwait), 'Abdullah Bin Saud, brother of 'Abdul 'Aziz, and 5 or 6 of the Araif were among the principal notables present. Afterwards went for a private talk in the maktaby or office, of Bin Sdud. Then breakfast. At 2 p.m . visited 'Abdur Rahman Bin Saud, the Imam, as he is generally called, an old man with saffron-coloured beard, about 70 years of age, a charming personage. We were conducted to a bright reception-room, with lofty roof, 3 central pillars and doors at both ends but in opposite corners of the rectangle ; triangular windows high up on walls let in plenty of light ; good carpets and cushions round walls. Long conversation, chiefly on general politics. 'Abdur Rahman is yellow in face, with the dark, clear, inscrutable eyes of the true and wise, resembling remarkably those of Lord Roberts. He is as strongly pro-British now as he was when Raunkiaer met him before the war in 1912. The latter remarked of him :—' On the last subject, the relative power of European States, especially in the matter of Africo-Asiatic politics, I could do no more than confirm the chieftain's deep-rooted belief in the hegemony of the British Empire' Most charming and affable to myself ; Mullah 'Abdullah and all my follow ing who accompanied me have been saying what a line old man the Imam is. Back to Palace, past the keep, which was taken by 'Abdul 'Aziz and his 45 faithful companions in 1910. Saw bullet marks in frame of huge door. There were 70 defenders but these surrendered after 20 of them had been killed and wounded. Long talk with the Amir in his private room; served with tea by a pretty boy. In came 'Abdullah al Hakim, a young ' medical ' of Mosul, who had got his degree in Constantinople. Handsome, Prench-looking, about 30. Speaks French fairly well. Also came Ahmad ibn Thanaiyan of the As-Saud family. Old-looking young man with ' tender eyes ', as the Bible hath it, understands French very well, was born in Constantinople. The Amir suspicious about me ; wants to know if I come to find out all about him and to criticize him ;—' What do we want of him ? He has carried out all he promised, wh'ch was to neutralize Ibn Rashid. But forhis(B. S.) menace, the Sherif would not have been in a position ever to rebel against the Turks ; Ibn Rashid would have put a stopper on any movement of his in that direction. So the fact that the Sherif has been able to keep the field so long against the Turks (even if his^ early success had been possible otherwise) is due to Bin Sdud's neutralizing the power of Ibn Rashid. Yet Bin Sdud's action, is not given proper credit by us. He has to hear himself traduced, people even saying that he is secretly helping Ibn Rashid to hold out against us—because he is supposed to be jealous of the Sherif. If he were so, which is not the truth, there would be some reason for his jealousy. The Sherif has secured a great position, he has got hold of the Harb and Ataibah tribes which belong to Bin S^ud and also some thousands of Qasimi—or Agailis as they are called—all subject to Bin Saud. Have we not poured gold into the Hijaz ? Here on this side everything has got dear. Riyals had appreciated (the relative value to the sovereign being 5 J dollars in ' Anaizah and 6^ in Riadh). Camels are dear and clothes too. Rice is now far more expensive than before the war. The Turks in Madinah and Syria are getting supplies through the Shammar and * Anaizah, who have come in to us, and so on, and so on Bin Sand's complaints are numerous. Money and supplies would, doubtless, put a fresh complexion on matters. We spoke about Ibn Rashid and the possibility of knocking him out. At first Bin Saud said it was an impossible task. ' Ibn Rashid was a Shaikh of a single, powerful tribe which would unite at once for self-defence in case of Hail being attacked. He (Bin Saud) could, of course, call on his tribes—the Mutair, Ahl-Mnrrah, Dawasir, Subai 3 Ataibah, Harb, Beni, Hajar, Beni Khalid, Dhafir, ' Anaizah, etc. All of them would gather at the bidding and would be a large mob, difficult to control orto keep concentrated for more than a few days in one locality. So that anything like prolonged operations against Hail with such levies was not to be thought of. Besides the business of getting these numerous clans together he has to arrange for the safety of his provinces of Qasim and Hasah and to leave strong Governors of his family with sufficient garrisons. A revolt of the Ahl-Murrah or an attack by the Ajman might prove disastrous if it took place while he was far away with all his fighting men. Thus, the first thing to be thought of when planning a distant operation would be the internal defence garrisons. The Sherif's system of paying a monthly wage to individual Arabs of £6 a month, or whatever the amount, was tantamount to making mercenary soldiers of them; this was not, in his opinion, an expedient method for him ( B. S.) to adopt. His tribesmen were Mujahidin who served and fought for honour, not for pay. However, he could easily do the same if necessary and, perhaps, accomplish better results. But with his subsidy of £5,000 per mensem it was impossible ; all he could do was to keep a force in Qasim to check the Shammar and keep his tribes in hand. If he were to attempt to overcome Ibn Rashid he muse have all the means required. He did not wish to share the fate of the English General who, he says, was sent Home a prisoner for having attempted to take Baghdad with inadequate troops and material I told him that the object of the mission of the officers now on their way from Hasah is to discover a pl^in for his effective co-operation with us and the Sherif in the work of expelling the Turks from the Peninsula. Doubtless, we would be able to hit on some arrangement after discussion. But what was his idea ? He said: — Firstly. —The economic question. He should have control of all his tribes in the matter of musohilah (access to markets ) at Katif, Qatar, Kuwait, Zubair, Basrah, Khamisiyah, Suqual Shuyukh, and the Euphrates, including Najaf and Karbala. He would keep his agents there; one agent in each market town, who alone would be able to recommend grant of passes to the blockade officers therein. This would xorce the S ha in mar, northern 'Anaizah, Dhafir, and others to turn to him and then a few months might make a great difference. Secondly. —He must have more pecuniary support. Mth Novemher. —Wdnt to the office of the Amir, where was an informal „ n'frcnf mejUs, at which I talked with the Amir Temp. 72, Bar, ^ for about J hour. Many subjects-the Balkans, Russia, the submarine campaign, Shakespear's refusal to believe that there could ever be a European war again, and how he showed him a quot ation from the Quran, or the tradition that Muhammad had foretold this worJd- conflagratioa. Some talk about Jesus' return ; how the Muhammadans do not believe him to have been crucified but to have ascended into heaven to return on the last day. Then went out into town and visited some shops. Saw a few jibhuns and handkerchiefs, but nothing: of good quality. Inspected camels and visited 'Abdul c Aziz and the Hamlah, who have a house at the end of the Suq. Had coffee with them. Saw 'Ali al Dhuwaihi there; he referred to my leaving him in the lurch when we came into Riadh. Poor old man ; he cannot keep up any pace at all. After breakfast worked till 1 p. m . Slept half an hour and then went out for a ride to one of the Amir's gardens with 'Abdul 'Aziz al Rabayi *JUxc ) and 2 other horsemen. Had coffee in the garden. Saw the splendid well; but water about 100 ft. below surface worked by large donkej s working up and down a ramp on both sides ( ). Cost of upkeep of well about 200 dollers per mensem. Fruit teees of all sorts, chillies, and egg plants. Rode back. , After supper, with our company, the Mullah and the rest went off to prayers in the mosque in the Palace. I sat writing until 8 p. m ., when I went over to Bin Saud's private room and stayed till 10-25 discussing politics. Bin Saud told me of a wonderful dream he had about the capture of Damascus and its destruction by him. He said he thought that with some help he and his tribes could capture Damascus. I said that was a splendid idea. Of course. Hail and the Shammar stand in the way. Ibn Rashid cannot be bought; of that 45 F. &amp; P. D.18 Bin Saud is certain. Nor can lie be brought over to onr side because it is the fundamental policy of Hail and the Shammar to lean on the Turks so as to remain independent of Najd. loth JVoym&amp;er.—Attended mejlis in Bin Spud's office. Sat next to ^ Faisal ibn Kashid, the fugitive: beyond W-x-MO'. ^ him was Ibn Farun ( J) fAbu Hamdi ) as he is called ] ; and his nephew, Musa ( ); another nephew, Sabri ( ), is also in Riadh. Sabri has a fair board and is very German-looking. Ibn Farun is a small, fat man of about 40, with a limp. Musa is tall and dark. Ibn Farun used to be a great friend of Bin Sand's. The latter now keeps him as a prisoner, but allows him some liberty. Many people say that the old friendship between them still continues, stib rosa, and the confinement of Ibn Farun is a mere pretence. The Amir was not keen on my seeing him in my rooms. Had a long talk with 'Abdullah al Hakim and Ahmad ibn Thaniayan. At 2-30 p. m . went for a ride with Bin S^ud and most ^ of the As-Saud family, including half a dozen little boys. Bin Sand led a sort of war-dance on horseback and, after galloping round for about half an hour, we went and sat under a mud wall in the sun while the horses were off- saddled and allowed to roll in the sand. Bin Saud fired 2 shots with a revolver and 10 with a rifle without hitting the mark, except once. A stone was stuck up at a distance of 150 yards. We then came back to the town in procession. After dinner, at 8 p. m ., went to the Amir as usual and heard a torrent of talk, mostly against Salim (Shaikh of Kuwait ), till 10-30 p. m ., when we retired. Bin Saud seems worried and never gets easily carried away by the exuberance of his word-flow. 16th November.—Mejlis at 8-80 this morning. Found the Amir alone. Letters brought from Hasah;Bin Saud very depressed about Italian re verses; description of situation by Eeuter as capable of resulting in a Bumanian debacle has given him a fright. Our success at Bir-Sheba did not make up for it. After breakfast Ahmad ibn Thanaiyan came and discussed politics. Went for gallop round Eiadh—which ih a small place—rode out to village of Manfuhah—riverbed of Wadi Hanifah—is very rocky here. Returned to supper, which I still continue to eat with my Bedouin companions. Must discuss camp for mission. Biadh cannot be larger than Shagrah though they say that it is. 17th November. —Had a little fever last night ; am sweating it out to-day. . rn T? 91K/Y Went for a ride on camel at I-45 (Arabic); Early morning —Temp. 73 , Bar. 2,150, . y ,. . x. j returned m time to attend mejhs at 3-10 (Arabic). Met the Amir ; several other members of the As-Saud family present, also Ibn Farun aadhis nephew, Musa, and Faisal ibn Rashid. After breakfast came 4 Abdullah al Hakim and endeavoured to persuade me to put my ideas of what Bin Saud should do on paper. I said that I must wait for the arrival of these two officers from Hasah and eee any instructions they might be bringing with them, but that our preliminary conversations had been of great value. I had quite a good general notion of what the Amir's ideas were and what he ^as able to attempt. The capture of Hail is the first, in fact, the only, problem we have at present to face. The fall of Hail wouM mean, in all /-v probability, the collapse of Madinah. Bin Sdud's main idea is his position in Central Arabia (now and after the war). The question now was a twofold one:—'Was he to maintain his present attitude and carry out his part of the baiigain made at Kuwait in November 1916 {vide page 11 of precis regarding the relations of the British Government with Bin Sdud), i.e., maintain a force in Qasim of 4,000 men to hold Ibn Rashid in check and attack him, if opportunity occurred, or to take a more active line ? In either case his finances must be bolstered up, but, in the latter case, he would require munitions and money far in excess of his present allowances and on par with the subsidies granted to the Sherif. In fact, we should regard and equip him as a British division. It is obvious that taking a more active part means attacking the Shammar and endeavouiing to capture Hail. It would be suicidal to make the attempt without adequate means in money, supplies, armed forces, and war material ' There cannot be ', he went on saying, ' the least doubt that but for his atti tude and for his keeping in check not only his own tribes, but those of Ib n Rashid alone made it possible for the Sherif to act with any freedom against the Turks now '.19 Bin Sdud is not in tlie least avaricious; in fact, his fault lies in the other direction, i.e., in excess of generosity. But he must haye more money to hold his tribes together. Turki at Buraidah had altogether run out of provisions, such as rice, etc., and that was one reason why he had to leave and come away to Riadh. The monthly cost of upkeep of 4,000 men at Buraidah would not be less than $56,000, or £9, 400 at the rate of $14 per man per month—$6 = £1 (the rate in 4 Anaizah was $5f=£1). I myself think that £10,000 per mensem and another 3,000 rifles, with ammunition and some light guns, would be sufficient to maintain the present somewhat inactive plan. The cost of large operations would have to be worked out by some other method. The Sherii's men are paid £6 per mensem, or $36 per mensem. Bin Saud would prefer the system of tribal-allowances. If major operations are undertaken who are the enemy and what is their strength ? They are Shammar and Ajman. The Ajman would have to be eliminated first, either by our making a special arrangement with them {e.g., to give hostages from every main clan to remain peacefully in Zubair and Kuwait) or by attacking them all round and then taking on the Shammar. Any attack upon Hail would bring all sections together to defend the place. They are a strong tribe. Moreover, they have the Turks close to their back door. In the evening again spent a couple of hours talking to Bin Sdud. 17t}i November. —At 8 a.m . rode out with Bin Saud to meet Turki. He and his cavalry charged, passed on to the Wadi bed, firing their rifles and pistols and Shooting as they passed Bin Saud, Tvho sat on the rim of a well in the shadow of a wall. This gallop past wa^ repeated three times and then there were greetings and kissings and general rejoinings. After that I returned to town. Had an interview at 8 p.m . as usual with Bin Sdud; discussed tribal matters. Talking about our policy with the Arabs, or for that matter the policy of any outside Power, we should, he hinted, be making a great mistake if we imagined we could mould such unstable material to our will. He compared Arabs to their country ; every now and then there was a great flood (seyl) which swept every thing away—buildings, gardens, and homes—down the tcadi. He likes to think fhat the Sherif's power is very temporary,, built on our largesse only. As soon as the money fails the tribes will return to their old allegiance and look to Najd as the fountain of lifcerty, secular and religious. Hence his interest in the Wahabi revivalist movement called the Ikhwan. His religious leadership will, he hopes, in the long run carry him on some such wave to the Empire of Arabia—the dream of all the Bin Sauds. 18th November. —Bode in the morning as usual on camel with Mullah* „ , . m Mirshid, and Amar.

He fled first to Greece, then to Egypt (6 months), India, and finally to Basrah, where he lived for some time before the outbreak of the war. He was, he said, with Talib Beg at Muhammareh when the latter was negotiating with our representatives there. Now lives at Hasah. Attended big dinner given by Bin Saud to all Shaikhs and people in honour of Turki's safe return from Qasim.

Returned in the afternoon, 22nd November. —Went to office of Bin Saud. Dr. 4 Abdullah came to see me. In afternoon w r ent for ride with Bin Saud and his family ,to Shamisiyah; returned at sundown. At 8 p.m . again went for 1 hour's chat with Bin Saud. He explained that his trouble with Ihn Subah (Kuwait) was not really connected with the question of taxation of the Awazim, for, though he did claim the latter as his subjects really, he was content to leave them to Ibn Subah ; the quarrel was really about the'Ajman. After their going off, contrary to their agreement, and joining with the Shammar to oppose him la^t winter and spring lie could not remain on any sort of terms with them. It was unfriendly of Ibn Subah to harbour them now. He would not hear of any further pardon. It was useless, as we knew, because their Shaikhs- were unrepentant. Dhaidan especially was a Turk of the Turks. Either they must surrender some of their chief Shaikhs and go off to help the Ataibah and Harb in Qasim or they should be told to go off to the 'Anaizah country and help Ibn Hadhdhal. Long discussion on world-politics followed before the last drink of lehan of camel s milk was brought—Bin Sdud s s signal for bed. 24th November. —Rode in morning to Manfuhah. Some photography. Ibn Thanaiyah came to discuss politics. Rode in morning with Fahad, Amar, and Muhammad ; after breakfast went to coffee with the men in their tuo houses in town ; looked for curios in Suq. Rode in the S. and \V . of the town with Il&gt;n Rabayi; discussed the 'A jman. Long conversation with the Amir chiefly regard ing tne ' Ajman and Ahl-Murrah. Says the 'Ajman out against him could not possibly muster more than 1,500 men. The Ahl-Murrah are now v»ell armed. 26th November. —Still no news of Philby and Cunliffe-Chien. Attended mejhs this morning ; religious discussion, ihe Amir again held forth on heresies and infidelity of Turks. There seems to be a general assent to these sentiments.

Two of the boys eventually found the trick, one leading both on a single rope and the other driving behind. Muhammad ibn Hahabas lost his aha (cloak) and had to ride back 5 miles for it. laris al Dawish, a Shaikh of the Mutair joined us in the evening. 6th December.— Broke camp 7-5 a.m . and reached the well of Banban ( Jb*) ) at 8-45 a.m . Banban Distance -U hours, miles. is a w itll plentiful, good Water at about 15 ft. below surface. The qasr is a ruined tower, and round it are some signs of cultivation. Left again at 10-15 alter watering; general direction N, W. More northerly than yesterday. Plenty of sheep and some catt and camels. Also saw many sandgrouse. The cultivators are men of Biadh. There is a pink sandhill at foot of Al-Arumah ( ) called Araidah ( ). The range of Al-Arumah trends towards Wadi Hanifah ( ), which it heads off beyond Manfuhah. At 11-45 a.m. reached high, rocky hill (about 120 ft. above on right of road) from which gqod view of Al-Arumah is obtainable. Boad rocky, latterly with black patches. Al-Arumah is the same colour as Tuwaiq, viz., greyish clay. Ihe sandhills, or Nufudh, below are pink. The water of Shaib Banban flows from Trest to east till it strikes the Nufudh which runs about N. W. and S. E. Thence its flow is S. S. E. The^ say the water of this shaib docs not join the adi Hanifah but disappears in the sand. A conspicuous object, pink sandhill, during the latter part of our march was bearing about 345° called '■ Nigah al Mutawah, Faraj Banban' ( )• 'We halted at 2-30 p.m . about 1^ miles short of this orange^coloured, pyramidal sandhill, the Mutawah ( ).

Sudus was about 4 hours from our mornjng halt. Halted at 2-30 p.m . at end of Araij al Banban. White cliffs to front and on right beyond orange-coloured sand strip, which we have marched close to all day. Village of Huraimlah one day's march on left. Country to leit open, stony steppe as far as Jabal Tuwaiq. At 1-30 p.m . crossed water course running close by the sandhills. Our camp w*as opposite Al-Khafs ( ) (about 10° East of North) and distant 1 hour from it. ♦ There is a lake at Al-Khafs which after an average flood is full for about 5 months. It is a favourite camp of Bin Saud's.

Horse spiked in of! forahoof deliberately. Tbe operator had left blood on near foreleg up to knee. Started at 9-25 a.m . The men (Mushin and Mutlaq) whom I sent with the lame pony overnight returned bringing Khudhayar and Raja'an whom they had met on the way. At about 10-45 a .m . we got clear of the sandbank, called Araij al Banban, and crossed an open plain going thence due north towards the Al-Arumah range, making for a gap in the hills which we reached at l-i5 p.m . Here on the right the cliffs are broken down as if by heavy artillery. This is called khatiasar (little fingers) (). The whole range of Al-Arumah is extraodinarily like a fort on a hill, such as Chiborgarh and others like it in India. Between 2-15 p.m . and 5-5 p.m . we crossed three watercourses, or shaihs as they are called, Al-Ruaighib ( ), Silah ( ), and Khanasir ). At 3-15 we reached the highest point on the pass when 1 took the barometric reading (3,100 ft.). There were higher domes on the right, perhaps 100 ft. above the road. The valley narrowed now and we came on to a watercourse where we camped at 4-15 p.m . having marched 7 hours on end *. 9th Deceinher. —Started at 6-15 a .m .

Temp, (p.) 5i 0 , Bar. 3,275'. entered valley which cuts the Al-Arumah range in 2 and is here about 4 miles broad. Our march was over red sand in a northerly direction, the ground falling away slightly to the east. The wells are due N. E. from this point on the edge of the Ats valley. Many Arabs about, mostly Subai and Sahul. \ alley of Ats runs W. S. W. and E. N. E. Splendid grazing, sandy. At 12-25 p. m . began to re-enter range of Al-Arumah from Ats, which here takes a bend to the north, we keeping our direction of 10° East of North. Half an hour later on our left hand are two hilis somewhat like a woman's breasts called Khanadar. Kept on till 2-25 p.m . when we crossed a broad watercourse called Al-Teri &gt;. Ascended slope and after 20 minutes reached high ground overlooking the wells in the bed of the Ats. The wells, 12 in number, hold good water, 81 ft. of water in evening at this time of year, but as at least 2,000 camels have been watering before us the level has probably gone down. Bed of Ats is here black with the trodden dung of ages; water is drawn by camels pulling a rope. Many women seem to be employed on this job. They look curious riding draught camels among the men. At the near well 5 camels were drawing at the same time. Shot some sandgrouse. Hafar al Ats is at least 3 hours south of the nearest Dahanah belt and not as shown on the map in the Dahanah. 10th December.— L q H Hafar al Ats at 7 a .m . Lovely pink dawn, though cloudy morning. A few drops of rain had fallen in the night. Got a heavy cold and fever. Thousands of camels were marching out from wells, where they had been watering overnight. There came in strings of sheep and camels from opposite directions to take their places. Some Shammar shepherds on their way to Bin Saud came into camp last night and went on their way to Riadh this morning. They belonged to the Aslam, a section of Ibn Khudhaiyim from Barazi's lot. There was a boy with them called Muisnid ibn Khudhaiyim, about 14 years old, very pleasimr in appearance. Our direction at starting was 10° West of North. Marched till 10-35 a.m. when we reached the Dahanah, which is thus at its nearest point 10 miles from Distance—45 hours, miles.

They belong to Mahmil which is separated from Sudair by Tuwaiq.

Our camp was in the valley which We have been marching dae north 1 ^ ^ 423 Hafar al Ats. Camped at 2-35 p.m . on 3rd ridge of Dahanah (counting from the south). Splendid grazing—mostly arfaj, nussi, and some Eottoms between ridges not so level as further westward. I think this is a better road than that via Al-Gara'a and Gaiyiyah by which we went to Bnraidah in October. Learnt to-day that the wonderful Ats Shaib commences at Shagrah, cuts through Jabal Tuwaiq, at or near Thadiq, and finally finishes in the Nufudh S. W. of Hafar al Ats. 11th December.— Started at 7-10 a.m .; halted for J hour at 8-55 for break- or . ^ .. fast on the plain below 3rd rideje.

This plain is about 2 miles broad, fine grazing, not much sign of a road, ground even over Nufudh quite firm. Met Alush bin Bargis af Dawish Mutair and gave him a pair of binoculars and 20 dollars. Bought one hawk and greyhound from Subai Shaikh for 20 dollars. Subai are very good-looking people. Bidge in front reached at 11-35 a.m . is called Al-Hamrawi ( )- Camped on 5tli ridge at 2-15 pm. 12th December. —Marched at 7 a.m ., crossed 5th ridge and broad plain beneath, marching N. E.

Sand ridges very steep on north side, but, generally speaking, the marches are easier in gradient than further west and firmer and more covered with vegetation, especially with nussi grass which is wonderful here. Have not been well last 3 days ; feverish, cold. Yesterday hawked hare and to-day a fat bustard. Halted for breakfast or coffee at 1C-15 for 45 minutes—magnificent grazing in raudha between 6th and 7th ridges. Temperature 44° this morning ; cold and drizzliug at midday. Had race with Bin Baud's men for £1. Ghu^im Mutair on my thelul « { Hamama ' won, Amar being 2nd, and the rest nowhere. Marched till 3-15 p.m . Drizzle all the afternoon and cold. Put up 4 hares and coursed 2 without success, the second getting into a deep hole. Nearly lost the hawk but Mirshid got it back by working a pair of bustard wings and calling ' Thiab-Thiab Passed the last ridge of the Dahanah and entered the Summan at 1-45 p.m. The Jaham is the broadest of all the 7 ridges. Such wonderful grazing, camel shrubs, and nussi grass I have never seen anywhere as this afternoon; indeed, these last 3 days we have passed a wonderful grazing country. The northern slopes of the Dahanah ridges are far steeper than the southern. Had dinner in my tent with 'Abdul 'Aziz bin Hassun, 'Abdullah, Mirshid, and Amar to eat the bustard and hare. Most cheery dinner, with plum-pudding, joint, tea, and biscuits to follow tM great meat dishes. Tobacco is much in demand in this bleak weather. Fahad al Dhafiri is a great joke. Always chilly, we find he wears (*verything&gt; including chafiyah and aba, m duplicate or triplicate. 13th December. —Started as usual at 7 a.m ., had coffee at 9-45 a . m ., came into camp ; still on the Summan at miles ' 3-5 p.m. The Summan landscape, stony _ hills with depressions, like so many huge hoof -marks in mud, sometimes circular but more generally elliptical, with no apparent exits. The bottom is clay and covered with vegetation. A dreary country passed through to-day reminding me to some extent of ptarmigan around in Scotland. Tried hawk and hound to-day but had no luck. The hares have all of them, got deep holes in the rooky summits of these hills. Hounds o-et their feet cut about by stones. The hawk did not like the weather to-day. It has certainly been bitterly cold and gloomy. North wind and heavy clouds that will not rain. General direction now due north. 14th December. —Started as usual 7 : 3 a.m .

Temp. 52% Bar. 2,3so'. when we halted for breakfast.Guides said the wells of Al-Habah wery still 3 or 4 hours distant. However, after marching on for about another hour we came suddenly on the hill overlooking the wells. Decided to stop short of the wells as we are wet and uncomfortable and want fuel more than water. There is never fuel nor grazing in the vicinity of important wells. Camped at 12-16 p.m . Have still got the 'Ajman ladies marching in our wake ; one is an aunt and the others connections of Shaikh Dhaidan ibn Hithlain. I send them food for which they are grateful and daily send thanks. They ride, two of them, in howdaha on theluls, and the third astride. Incredible story brought me by Dabbi to-day that on the day that Ibn Kabayi left us with 'Abdullah Shammari to go to Riadh he learnt that there were 9 German anJcar (soldiers) at Riadh. Afterwards, when we had reached Shagrah from 'Anaizah, the 9 Germans passed us along another route to Hail. In Riadh he learnt that they had come by ship from the Hijaz. He said that Bin Saud wanted only to make himself strong and was taking all he could from both sides. He meant to make Ibn Sabah (Kuwait) acknowledge his supremacy and to attack him if he would n(5t comply. Meanwhile, the Kuwait standard is at Gara'a, 2 days this side of Subaihiyah. Dabbi believes that the Subai are out raiding against Kuwait. Of course, Bin Saud's policy is self-centred. He, possibly, thinks that the Central Powers will get the upper hand, at least in Asia Minor. He wishes to consolidate his power over all the Arab tribes of Najd, Hijaz, and East Syria. Dreams of the restoration of the ephemeral Wahaui Empire of former days undoubtedly are the main spring of his policy. That is why he is fostering the Ikhwan revival at Artawiyah. The Ikhwan are receiving daily accessions. When at Riadh it was the Ataibah ; now I hear that the majority of the Mutair and some Shammar has been converted. This is a militant Wahabi revival ; they consider any intercourse with Christians to be pollution, while the rather loose Muhammadans of Kuwait are treated as misbelievers. Therefore, the Ikhwan are hated in Kuwait. Old Faris al Amaid of the Mutair, however, said that he had not gone over. He, for instance, did not believe in them ; he was not going to lie he said. Bin Sdud thinks that the Ikhwan will make a splendid fighting nucleus. They are real fanatics. My reader, 'Abdullah ibn ^Abdulillah, a very devout Muhammadan who always leads prayers in my camp and is regarded as a learned Mullah, says that the Ikhwan are ignorant and, ill-conditioned. According to him the worst thing about them is their intolerance of their co-religionists, whom they call Kafirs (Yakafarum ghai Musalmin). My experience of the Arabs here and elsewhere in Mesopotamia is that they regard us as softies. England to them is a sort of fairy godmother, rolling in wealth, kindly, and silly. This attitude does us no harm, no more than the prosperous man's patronizing of the Almighty harms the latter or deflects him a hairsbreadth from his inexorable designs. As a policy in contrast to that of German frightfulness British softness and apparent blindness has paid us 'well. We have roped in the whole world thereby while Germany has only secured Bulgaria. Still going over this uninteresting Summan steppe, following what is, apparently,, a long valley, but is actually a succession of such valleys, the longer axes of which run N. and S. and thus facilitate our way, forming, in fact, a sort of sunken road; innumerable paths lead off on both sides. Have sometimes left road for a few miles and everywhere found a network of such paths, any one of which, if followed,* takes the general direction of the main road. The main road is called makatti ( ), or the cutting. Many Salubis about but no other Arabs come this way at this time of year. Halted close to peculiar sugar-loaf hill about 250 ft. above surrounding depression and standing in its midst. We are in sight of the wells of Al-Haba from this spot.

We started Distance—73 Lours, 25 mirntcs, milee. , n-iii .i „ Temp. 49°, Bar. 2,120. when all had been watered, a matter of 4 hours. There are 2 wells, the position of which reminds one both of Al-Gara'a and Hafar al Ats, in a sort of25 arena with an amphitheatre of stony hills of the regular Summan nobby- shape. These 2 wells contain ^ood water at a depth of 25 ha, or 150 ft-, i.e., the same as Al*Gara'a to the N. W., which we passed on our march to Buraidah. Got off at about 11-35 a.m ., but went to the wells to water the horses and sheep, of which 10 only remain of the flock of 20 presented to us by 'Abdul 7 Aziz (Bin Sdud). Halted at 2-45 p.m . by another solitary sugar-loaf hill rising out of the broad depression. Direction due north, marching in teeth of shimal (north wind), with fine, cutting rain. Obliged to dismount from camel and was so stiff could hardly walk. Walked last couple of miles into camp. Usual dreary Summan scenery but valleys more open than on Kuwait-Zilfi route. Vegetation poor (no nussi), light yellow sand. The sand on the Summan is different altogether from that on the Nufudh, which is extremely fine and pinkish in colour (in the distance orange). Thuuder in west. The Arabs say about it that it means a seyl, or flood, at a distance of 2 days. In the summer lightning like tljat is only 4 or 5 hours distant. Mahsin, the Imam's man, told me to-day, apropos of my having fever, that Bin Saud was a great doctor. I said ' How did he heal ?' He said *' By siyasah ; but it was a wonderful thing Am feeling travel-weary; hence the fever I think. I left Kuwait July 30th for India, rushed about for a month, and then returned via Basrah and Baghdad to Kuwait, whence I started on this journey.

Beneath this is a long shaib, said to be 2 days' journey long, called Shaiyith ( ajju ^ ). We crossed this and ascended a pass over the range, the second rise of which must be 400 ft. above the shaih level. On top we found a bare, open plain sloping northwards. This was at 2-15 p.m . Camped in narrow watercourse valley, with plenty of camel stuff and coarse grass. Both ponies tucked up from want of sufficient food. Arabs say they do not dream of taking horses across the country at this time of the year. Eaining heavily at sundown. Still seedy, my head going round ; took quinine and Dover's powder. At 11-15 we had passed Salubi tents on our left close to a hill called Hasaniyah (fox-lands), or Um al Hasani, but otherwise saw no signs of Arabs. 17th December. —Marched at 7-1.) a.m ., and with -^-hour interval.

MEMORANDUM Would it be poeelblA to arrange for the period!- oal vieit of a British man-of-war to Bahrain. Such Yisits would, I an sure, act as a great deterrent to any smuggling of tea or ammunition that may be going on on the quiet from Bahrain or Qatar to the Persian Littoral* I cannot say that I know of any definite oases of such smuggling, but every now and then I get strange stories brought me of smuggling on an extensive scale of tea from Muharraq to the Persian coast* 2. Apart from the above the occasional presence of a war ship in Bahrain harbour would do much to keep our pres tige alive among a set of people who are only too apt to forget that the British Empire exists and does take interest in Bahrain affairs. Personally also I know my own work would be greatly facilitated if Shaikh Xsa were to occasionally wake up and see a war ship lying out in his harbour* /0 i^aJor, C*l*i.*, Political Agent, Bahrain* Copy forwarded with compliments to the Civil Commissioner, BaghdadI \ INDIA OFFICE RECORDS I .mr...\366&amp; MICROFILM ••••••••</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000326_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/71</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000326</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/71</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Miscellaneous reports and correspondence relating to Kuwait</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1918/1920</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-03-28T00:05:34</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (41 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at 1 on the front cover and terminates at 42 on the last folio before the back cover.
