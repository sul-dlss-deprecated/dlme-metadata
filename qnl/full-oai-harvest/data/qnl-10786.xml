The correspondence primarily concerns Shaikh Hasan bin Muhammad, a former Shaikh of Khasab who was sentenced to twenty-two months' imprisonment by the Government of Muscat and Oman and then sent to Debai [Dubai] by the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, on the understanding that Shaikh Said bin Maktum, Ruler of Debai, would keep Shaikh Hasan under surveillance and prevent his return to Khasab.
