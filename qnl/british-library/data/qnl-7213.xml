Reports on Slave Trade, 1852-59 ...CHAPTER I. Measures for the suppression of slavery in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf. Statement of all treaties, statutes, etc., on the subject with their contents up to the year 1873. One of the cardinal principles of British Administration of their world-wide Empire on sea and land has always been the abolition of slavery. A clear history of the genesis and growth of this policy will be found in the article on Slavery in the Encyclopedia Bntannica. As regards the trade in negro-slaves between the dominion of Zanzibar, on the East Coast of Africa, and the Arabian and Persian shores, it would be worth while to read Edward Hutchinson's little work 'The Slave Trade of East Africa' (1874), which brings up the history of the measures taken by Great Britain in the suppression of this slave trade to the beginning of the year 1874. Of the recent publications ' Zanzibar in Con temporary Times' by Robert Nunez Lyne treats the subject exhaustively and in a very interesting manner in Chapters IV, VI, VlII, IX, X, XIII and XV. 2. Our official correspondence up to the year 1876 is summarised or abstract ed in the following publication Bombay Selections^ 1856, No. XXIV.—Paper on Slave Trade by Lieutenant A. B. Kemball with engagements up to the year 1851, pages 635 et seq. Precis of Zanzibar Affairs l 1856-J2) by Captain Henderson, Chapter VI, on Slave Trade. 2. -A. There are in the Bombay Records also two interesting reports on Slave Vol. 107 of 1 860. * Trade from January i, 1853^0 June 30, Vol. 88 of 1861. 1858, and from July 1, 1858, to June 30, '859. b y Captain Disbrowe, Assistant Resident in the Persian Gulf, which are printed Appendix to this Precis.

We subjoin below a complete statement of the Farmans or decrees passed and treaties and engagements concluded by the Sultans of Maskat and Zanzibar, the Maritime Arab Chiefs in the Persian Gulf, the Porte, the Shah of Persia and the Rao of Kutch, and the British Legislative Enact ments passed and orders in Council and proclamations issued, for the purpose of the more effectual suppression of the slave trade up to that year. They indicate the several stages of the progress of the measures taken by the British for attaining their noble object, culminating with the treaties con» eluded with the Sultans of Maskat and Zanzibar and the assurances obtained from the Maritime Arab Chiefs in 1873 and the Slave Trade Act of 1873, which have served since then as the main basis of the anti-slave trade operations and do still serve that purpose, being given only wider international scope by the Brussels Slave Trade Conference Act of 1890 :— Treaties, Farmans, enact ments, etc. Subject matter.

One of the deplorable facts connected with the slave traffic from East Africa was the complicity clearly proved Political a ., October 1873. Nos. 2 i8- 2 2o, of a ]arge nuII]ber of t 'he natives of India in the nefarious traffic, either directly or indirectly. The following memorandum drawn up by Sir Bartle Frere, long though as it is, on the subject is a most interesting document and worth perusal:— Memorandum regarding Banians or Natives of India tn East Africa. Of all classes connected with the trade of East Africa there is none more influential than the natives of India generally known as ' Banians'. History of Indian Trade with East A/rica.—Greek and Roman authors describe a flourishing commerce between India, Arabia, and East Africa, and the earliest detailed accounts we have of this coast represent a distribution of races connected with trade very much resembling what we now find existing, Native-African rates as cultivators, labourers, and sometimes, though rarely, as rulers. The ruling power at ports generally in the hands of foreigners of Arab or Persian origin, and all trade monopolized by Indians, or Arabs witb Indian connection, and having their homes and chief places of business sometimes on the Egyptian Arabian, or Persian Coast, but more often in India, at Tatta in Sind, Mandavie in Cutch /the ports of Kuttyawar or the Gulf of Cambay, Surat, Calicut, and other ports on the Malabar Coast. Vasco de Gama* and the Portuguese who followed him found a trade relatively to the .S«'Th e three ,oy. g « of V.»co d« Gam.,' 'st of the commercial world much larger and translated by Lord Stanley of Aldetley for the more important than at present; but carried on Hakluyt Society, 1869. much in the same fashion, by vessels of the same build and character as the modern dhows, availing themselves of the regular trade-winds to sail to and fro, between the ports on the same coasts of Africa, India, Arabia, and Persia, and carrying articles of much the same character as at present; and, what is more to our present purpose, he found all this trade in the hands of men whose homes were in India, or closely connected with India, and he describes the traders as in dress, habits of life and trade character and names exactly resembling what a modern traveller would find at the same ports on the same coasts. The Indian traders do not appear in his day to have reached further south than one of the large rivers south of Sofala, where he met the first of the 0 Moors ' seen in his first voyage. But they were then in possession of all the best trade at every port from Sofala northwards to Aden. This vast Indian trade seems to have been sorely crippled, and in part extinguished bv the advent of Europeans on these seas. Empire in these parts, then as now, fell to the nation which had the greatest command of ships of war, fire-arms, and artillery. The Portuguese were far more powerful at sea than any nation they met with on the Coast, and speedily subdued the whole Coast, from the southernmost limit of the Indian trade to Aden and Socotra, and by Muscat and Ormuz to the Persian Gulf, building forts at al the principal ports and commanding points of estuaries and islands, and destroying the Arab and Indian Marine; their own account of their proceedings, and of the wholesale cruelties they oractised on all who opposed, or were suspected of opposing them, are sufricient to account for the extinction of the greatest part of such trade as they found; for the bitter opposition thev met with from the Arabs, who ultimately resumed the dominion of all north of Cane Delgado and for the sterile character of their occupation of the Coast where they had no hold but on the fears of the natives, and thus missed the opportunity of developing their hostile occupation into an African Empire. At the same time during the greater part of the 17th and 18th centuries. Rovers, English, Dutch and Arab made these Seas unsafe to all but large and well-armed vessels. is Of the proceedings of the English and Dutch some idea may be formed from De Foe s Novels, e g., ' Captain Singleton ' and the 2nd part of ' Robinson Crusoe and from the adventures of European privateers and pirates, as related in the Tales of Buccaneers, nor if we mav iudge from the sober narratives of our earlier voyagers did the Native-Indian or Arab merchantman fare much better at the hands of the regular European trader, up to the time when the English East India Company obtained the undisputed mastery of Indian Foreign Commerce. The Great Company then put down English and Dutch freebooting and piracy, at the same time as and by the same measures by which they put down al 1 ' free trade ' as competition with their own monopoly was then called, but it was not till the present century that much was done to check Arab piracy, which went far to es, destroy what little Indian trade with Africa Portuguese misgovernment had spared. fi tj to s a g 0 the depredations of Arab pirates in the Indian Seas, and even on 01 the Indian Coasts within sight of Bombay, were matters of recent memory 1 have met in mv earlv life many men, Natives and Europeans, who had suffered from their outrages or had taken a part in putting them down. The pirates come from all ports between A en and the head of the Persian Gulf, but the most numerous, active, and cruel were from the southern ports of the Persian Gulf, where Wahabee and other forms of religious fanaticism gave a species of sanction to their depredations andcruelt.es. Their suppression was8 mainly due to operations directed 'he^ctivTty oHteBolnbay Marin''Sd The Indian traders seem never to have qnite forsaken the African trade when^.t was at its lowest, which was probably in the latter par o M j : e in Cutch and from present century. A few ships made an annual voyage from , 1 Pnacf^ Inrat BombaJ; and occasionally from other ports of the ^'y^X^^ltad^ bn bringing ivory and other African produce, m exchange for cloth, metals, and beads .but theif return from what was then a most hazardous voyage was a great eyent at all the Ports to XTthey belonged, calculated, and watched for, as the season of fa.r wmds came round, and greeted, at Mandavie and all the smaller ports, by crowds assembled on the shore, and by firing of guns and general rejoicing in the shipping and town. While Surat and Guzerat had a large manufacture of blue cotton cloth, as late as 50 years ago, East Africa was the chief market for it; some, it was said, was carried by the Portuguese to Brazil; but the greater part found a market in the interior of Africa About that time Captain Owen found a few Banians and Indians at every place of trade on the coast, but the very small commerce they carried on seems often to have struck iim. I have met during my present visit to this coast few Indian houses which boast an antiquity of more than 40 years. Some have told me that the usual system of trade in former days was for a supercargo to deal from the ship ; though there were always a few Indian residents at each port where there was sufficient of a settled Government to ma their property secure. In Madagascar and elsewhere, the Indians assured me that thoug their oldest house was not of more than 60 years' standing, their caste had traded to the coast for ages previous. During the past 40 years, the great Indian immigration to this coast has gone on At a constantly increasing rate, which bids fair to restore the Indian trade with Last Africa to more than its old proportions. Many causes have contributed to this end the genera peace in Europe, the final suppression of Arab piracy, the establishment of the Muscat Arabs at Zanzibar and on the Coast, the appearance at Zanzibar and elsewhere of English, French, German, and American houses ; and probably above all, the great impulse given to Indian trade by the extinction of the Company's monopoly, and by the vast development of commercial enterprise, among those Indian castes which have heretofore almost mono polised this branch of commerce. I have been assured on good authority that the tresh arrivals from India last year numbered more than 250 traders to Zanzibar and its neigh bourhood alone. For some of the Indian trading classes, trade in East Africa seems to have the same charms as colonising has for some of our own countrymen at home. Present Numbers and Classes. —It is difficult to arrive at exact conclusions as to the total numbers of Indian traders on the East African Coast, but I am convinced that the Vide Administration Report, July iSth best official returns are considerably below the truth. ,8 7 o . Dr. Kirk estimated the Indian traders connected with Zanzibar in 1870 at 3,710 of all castes. His paper is so valuable that an extract cf the portion relating to these classes is annexed; but probably the returns at his disposal, chiefly furnished by the Sultan's Farmer of Customs, gave only the residents at the principal ports, or those who were known to the heads of the community at Zanzibar ; for we found at almost every place we visited numbers considerably in excess of those be set down; and we met them as long settled residents at many places omitted in his list, and w r ere assured of their residence at many more. It is possible that they may at some of these places be late arrivals, or be included under the larger centres of trade entered in Dr. Kirk s list of 1870. But there can, I think, be no doubt that the aggregate number is much larger and that they are more widely scattered than would be supposed from that return. Each individual is generally an independent trader, or partner, or managing clerk in a house of business, and few have families, so that their numbers in Zanzibar would represent in India a commercial community manifold more numerous. Most of them belong to four or five of the great trading classes of Western India. We met a few representatives of other castes, a few goldsmiths (Sonars), tailors (Guzerat Darzis), servants, such as cooks, washermen, etc., and two bards (bhats) travelling to the extent to which the love of African travel has of late years possessed some of the least moveable of Indian races. All these, however, were rare exceptions, and the Indians we met were generally— Bhattias. Lohana Wanias. Khojas, Mehmons or Bohras. Bhattias and Banians.~~T\\t Bhattias are probably the most important by wealth and influence at Zanzibar, and with the Banians proper, or Lohanas, who are comparatively few in number, form the Hindu portion of the Indian community.

With rare exceptions all these Indian traders are birds of passage. The houses they belong to may be of old standing, and we met a few old men who had been in Africa all their lives ; but they were exceptions. The Hindus never bring their wives or families to Africa. The Bff^ras and Khojahs do frequently, but even they seem to have as little idea of settling, or adopting the country for iheir own, as a young Englishman in Hong-Kong. Of all these races it may be observed that they have been less affected than the upper classes of Indians in general by Furopean education in India. All are so devoted to trade that the boy goes into the counting-house as soon as he can read and write ; and, in the case of the Khojahs, I am assured that the pontifical authority of Agha Khan has been actively exerted to prevent any of his followers from attending an English school. In Zanzibar itself the relation between the European or American House and the ' Banian ' very much resembles that with which we are familiar in India. The European merchant buys and sells with the aid and advice of a ' Banian ' who sometimes stands to the foreign firm in a relation more like that of a partner than a mere broker, agent, or go-between. Away from Zanzibar the ' Banian ' or ' Hindu ' is more of a retail dealer, bartering his import wares for country produce, which he sells wholesale at Zanzibar to the exporter. In the outports and country marts he does little wholesale business, except by making advances of import goods to adventurers going up the country, on engagements to be re-paid by returns of up-country produce. The Banians generally keep to the ports or within a short journey of the coast or navigable parts of large rivers. 1 he trade with the far interior is almost exclusively in the hands of Arab, or Arab half-castes, and Swahili or Coastmen, who push as rapidly as they can across the first 2oo miles from the Coast, halting little by the way. Livingstone tells of their having penetrated far beyond his furthest into Casembe's country ; he had found them years before on the Upper Zambezi, and the Governor-General of Mozambique told me that when he was at Koanda two or three years ago, two Zanzibar Arabs from Kilwa appeared in Angola, about the same time that some natives sent from Loanda reached Ibo, on the east coast, taking two years to go and return. I may remark in passing that the stock in trade which we usually found in the Banians' shops was as frequently of German or American as of English origin. The cotton fabrics were English, American, or German, with smaller quantities of Indian or French. The best hardware was English but much inferior in make, was of continental manufacture, coarse crockery of German, brass and copper-ware of American make, beads, English and German { enetian ?) ; guns, old, of English make, new of German or French, some as low as io^. or 12^. each in retail price, _ J 0 *' 1 ex l e f;f trade carried on by Indians.-^i the total extent of the trade which passes throagh Indian hands, it would be difficult to form any reliable estimate. Dr. Kirk * Vide Administration Report for 1870. shows* that the Zanzibar Customs House returns , u i. . j t 1 ^ a ver y fallacious guide, nor will Indian or English returns be a better index; for the German and American, the French, Arabian, Persian, and Malagash trade, which comes direct, as well as the English and Indian trade, passes through the same hands. ' Dr Kirk was. however good enough to show me the details of transactions of a single Indian house whose affairs had been the subject of judicial investigation in his court. The books showed a capital of about ^434,000 invested in loans and mortgages in East Africa. Of this about ^60,000 had been advanced in various ways to the Sultan and his family, a rather larger sum to Arabs in the interior of Africa, a somewhat smaller amount to A. abs in Zanzibar and on the Coast, but the total of advances and loans to Arabs and natives of Zanzibar, all slave-owners, and most of them slave-dealers, was little less than £200,000. I his sum had been lent and advanced in various ways by loans, advances and mortgages on every kind of property, real and personal, and on various kinds of Lcuritv by advances of goods for trade, etc. Loans and advances to Europeans and Americans were set down at about ^140,000 and those to Indians in Africa at about ^100,000. i ,.'^ iese w e re African assets, and did not include stock in trade or the ram'fal fi, aaas''-—- SNSsTisaia-jisu'si11 In a word, throughout the Zanzibar coast line, extending alone 14 decrees of latiftid* £ H r a g r drv nd a f lof '''t 8 ' 311 banki 'f me r«„til€ business passes thigh without lndian aie.cv ■ no °„ - . ™SoUa mortgage effected, or a bill cashfd w tnout Indian agency not an import cargo can be distributed, nor an export cargo collected the Arab nr's ! d ^ eS g0 thr0Ugh Indian hands - The European o?

I know nothing like it in 7^;^ ^ commerce, and it is difficult to convey to those at a distance an adequate idea of the extent or completeness of the monopoly. We wonder at the vast development of Greek com mercial industry during the same period, but though their business may be on a larger scale ^ Same ^ 0f m0n0 P^ Wllich lhe .

Northward it extends with rare intervals along all the shores of Africa Arabia, Persian Gulf and Baluchistan to the western frontiers of India. Along some 6,000 miles of sea coast in Africa and its islands, and nearly the same extent in A^ia the Indian trader is, if not the monopolist, the most influential, permanent and all pervadino- element of the commercial community. I doubt whether along the whole coast from Delagoa Bay to Kurrachi there are half a dozen ports known to^omm^ Indian traders are not better able as a body to buy or sell a cargo, than any other class and at most of the great ports a cargo can only be sold or collected through them. ' It may be asked how it is possible that such a trade can have grown up so little notired by the commercial wor d elsewhere ? The explanation is to be found 'n the fact thaUhe ^ J belong to the commercial classes, which, less than any others in India, have assimilated their methods of commerce to ours. The Parsis and manv r.f-V.P mercantile classes in Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras, even when they have not adopted our our comm ercial associations, and, so to speak, make more or less common cause ' ^ ^ r0 Pf an merc ^ ant ' But this has not been done by any of the classes who havp absorbed the African trade ; and our European merchants and officials and fhamh^rc nf C0 0 mmunu e y kn0wpr0bab ' y IeSS 0f their P roceedin g s than of any other class in the mercantile Then the European and American commerce to Africa has been almost a serrpf mnnr. ^71' a V u ery The greatest pains have been taken to keep everything quiet' and though some of the houses traded on a great scale and employed quite a fleet nf merchant vessels the extent of their business was known to none but t ^Sves and L! not fully realized by any but the most observant of their neighbours at Zanzibar.

If the general opinion of well-informed persons may be trusted' ^ traders (Bhattias and Banians) less frequently commit tbe ^® e ^ ves d y { arrangements made than the Mahomedans (Khojahs, Mehmons, and Bohras), and I heard ° f tb e by a Bhattia firm for alleviating the sufferings of slaves on ^'if same great emporium of slave export by a permanent dole of master, nlace the leading member of a Bhattia firm, acting as His Hig . kept reoeatedlv assured me that no slaves were exported from his port, nor any acc ° unt F of ^hem, though, as I told him, 1 had seen at Zanzibar the abstracts of the accounts, and the*3 I returns of the customs received on slaves from that very port. Again at I.amoo, at the other extremity of His Highness' dominions, where the Bhattia Custom-master received us with all honour and professed the utmost willingness to give information, he denied that slaves were exported, save in very small numbers and clandestinely ; though we were subsequently assured that a day or two previous to our arrival news having come of our approach several dhows cleared out with cargoes of slaves, mostly Gallas and Abyssinians : and at both these ports the fact of a large and constant trade in slaves is not only notorious but is not denied by the central authorities at Zanzibar. It can hardly be said in cases like this that however free the Bhattia may be from direct slave-dealing, he is not clear of complicity in the crime by aiding, abetting, and concealing it. As regards practical remedies for this state of things, I confess I can think of none save the extirpation of slave-trading as a branch of ordinary and legitimate trade in the dominions of the Sultan, while it is permitted by His Highness' laws and participated in by every member of the reigning family, and by their associates and dependents. It seems to me to be impossible to devise regulations which shall effectually bar our own subjects, who monopolize the trade of the country, from sharing its profits. All trade in human beings must be prohibited, and cease to be legal with the aid of our subjects ; controlling as they do the whole of every kind of trade, the slave-trade may then be effectually stopped. But nothing less will, I feel assured, be effectual or will acquit our Government of its responsibilities in the matter. It has been proposed to withdraw British protection from British-Indian subjects who are implicated in the slave-trade, and this ought of course to be done as a part of the punishment when such implication is proved. But where all are, in a greater or less degree, indirectly implicated, such a measure would be ineffectual, if partially applied only in cases of proved complicity, whilst it would be impossible to make it of general application. Nor if it could be applied by a general withdrawal of protection would it absolve our Government from its national liabilities, Our subjects have come to the East African Coast, and got implicated in this criminal traffic, because they were our subjects. Under no other flag could they have come in such numbers, and so monopolised trade ; we cannot, if we would, now withdraw our protection, except for proved breach of our laws : and as a matter of fact, whatever we might say about withdrawal, it would not be possible to avoid protecting an Indian trader in his lawful calling, if any other power Avere seriously to molest him. But whilst a complete stoppage of the slave-trade is the only effectual remedy, other subsidiary measures should not be neglected. The strictest notice should be taken of all cases of direct participation, and fuller effect should be given to the measures commenced by Colonel Rigby for dissevering all Indians, whether subjects of Her Majesty or of her allies, from slave-holding. Whilst I cannot acquit any portion o£ the Indian community of indirect connection wjth slave-trade, I believe there is no class so anxious to see this question settled, and so cordially desirous that the slave-trade should be at once and permanently prohibited as the more respectable Indian houses at Zanzibar. They see clearly that whilst it is an open question all other trade must suffer, and the full development of the unrivalled commercial capabilities of the Coast must be indefinitely postponed.

Thirty years ago there were here only 165 families and 26 married women, showing that the members of this sect have multiplied six-fold in the last thirty years, and the married or settled past have increased in a still greater ratio. This increase has been of late entirely owing to the arrival of emigrants from Kutch. The Khojah community is governed by a council of five elders (the Amuldavi), who on the occurrence of a death vacancy elect the successor. There are two officers chosen yearly by the council to attend to routine business ; these are the Muki and Kamaria, but their position is altogether subordinate to the Council of Jemad. The five members of the Jemad at present are— 1. Rahutullah Kama, of Nuggur. 2. Taria Topan, of Kutch. 3. Lalji Thawer, of Kutch. 4. Alibhoz Somji, of Nuggur. 5. Gullam Hossein Tidepar, of Kutch. Since the death of Hama, father of the first on the above list, there has been no Waris or president nominated by the Agha Khan.IS No act is considered binding on the Khojah bodyi or in any way legal that has not received the assent, either verbal or in writing, of every one of the five members of the Amuldavi. The amount raised by the Khojahs for religious purposes and remitted to the Agha Khan in Bombay was last year 45,000 rupees ; this year it will equal 60,000 rupees, exclusive of the sum of 12,000 rupees left by will to the Agha Khan. Every year the number of Khojah pilgrims to Kerbella increases ; this season about 150 set out at the beginning of the south-west monsoon in April and May. The total mortality from cholera during the late epidemic among the Zanzibar Khojahs has been 135, or 6^ per cent, of the whole. Besides the large building or Jematkhana used for the weekly feasts and on other public occasions, the Khojahs are possessed of other property in town and of the neck of land uniting Zanzibar town with the island ; this is partly occupied by their cemetery and mosque. 2. Bohrahs —In the middle of the eighteenth century the Bohrah Mussulmans, people of Surat, settled on the north-west coa&amp;t of Madagascar, about the same time as Khojahs from Surat settled in Zanzibar. They next formed trading stations on the African Coast between Lamo and Patta, an4 to this day still hold in their hands the greater part of the trade of that region. During the past fifty years Bohrahs of Surat and Rajcote have ceased to arrive, but a great emigration has taken place from Kutch. The Bohrah community in Zanzibar is guided by a Moolla and the chief men of the sect but possess no well-organized Council like that of the Khojahs. The orders of the Chief of jguraJt are in jail cases fi nal. This body possesses separate mosques and burial-grounds in Zanzibar.

The Banians of Zanzibar and the slave-trade. 'the Banians' of Zanzibar are Hindus and jst • 2nd- m i oo«'fhp Banians' of Zanzibar are rimaus ana Mahamedans'orKn^ch^Kattywar and a few from other parts of the Bombay Presidency. It is said of them— -That they hold slaves, and -That they support and encourage the slave-trade, which, but for them, would dwindle into small proportions. a It is not necessary to allude to the sources from which these impressions are derived, ffrt 'it to savthat thej do prevail, and with some, amount to conviction. It is however, so far as I am aware, that they are not based on the result of any formal enquiry. ''rUnrp taken bv the Committee of the House of Commons in 1871 does not supply I ofsnch an enquiry, as it merely touches incidentally on the subject. On the contrary u 6 • f ation it ffives is of so oreneral a character as likely to mislead m absence of the inf ° rn ^ f instance, the answer to questions Nos. 296 and 636 may lead one to beUeve thtitfl/ZtheBanians inZanzibar. who a?e subjects of Native States, are free to acquire, and that they do acquire, and hold slaves, b-uch is not, however, the cabe a will be seen from the following remarks. n. The first intimation the Banians received against holding slaves was given them fhp vear tS^Q by Colonel (now Major-General) Rigby, who followed it up with rigorous measures, and succeeded in emancipating the slaves held by the Banians Many nf ihe-e Banians had lived in Zanzibar for 25 years and upwards, and had been allowed to nossess slaves. The legality of Colonel Rigby's proceedings, with regard to subjects nf Native States, was disputed by his successor, and on the question being submitted to the Government of Bombay, it was decided that those subjects of Native States who might declare themselves to be under the authority of the Sultan should not be interfered with. Some of the Banians took advantage of this decision, and began to buy slaves. But His Highness the Rao, whose subjects the bulk o£ them were, issued a proclamation 01*7 placing all his subijects at Zanzibar under the jurisdiction of Her Ma e sty's Consul in the sama way as purely British subjects, so that the case now stands thus; no Native of India can either purchase or sell a slave, and out of the whole Indian population at Zanzibar, about 4,000 in number, only 76, who had registered themselves previous to tha Rao s proclamation, as subject to the Sultan's authority with the sanction of Govern ment, and who at the time had among them rji slaves, are recognized as leg'al owners of slaves; but they are not allowed to sell any of them, or fill casualties by buying fresh ones. 4- The rest of the Banians and all new arrivals from India are absolutely debarred from buying or holding slaves ; and I have discovered no grounds on which to suspect the prevalence of slavery among them. There are appearances, however, which subject them, along with all other residents in Zanzibar, to unfavourable suspicions on the part of casual observers. Large numbers of Negroes are to be seen in their shops and houses,' and employed on out-door work, apparently differing in nothing from the slaves of Arabs. But with regard to those employed in shops and houses, the Banians declare that many of them are servants receiving wages, and some are freed slaves, who, of their own free-will, prefer to remain in their families, where^ i am convinced from what I have seen of Zanzibar, they are much better^ off than they would be by leaving them. Numbers of this latter class live with their families in their own huts, and when one of them dies, the master whom he was last serving usually reports his death at the Consulate, in order that his property may be disposed of according to law. All these Negroes know well that they are free, and that the Banians cannot hold slaves; they go to the Consul when ill treated, and change one family for another. I am informed that within the last three years or so only one case of slavery (not domestic) has been detected, in which a Bohrah, being found guilty of having bought slaves on the Coast, was sentenced to banish ment and fine. / k regard to the Negroes employed by the Banians on out-door labour, they (the Banians) declare that they are so employed usually on daily, and in certain cases on monthly, wages. If a Banian requires 50 labourers he collects them without difficulty within half an hour. It is a matter of indifference to him whether any of them, and how many, are slaves. But in this he acts like all other merchants paying the price of labour to the labourers in person. I may mention one significant fact that no Indian thinks of agriculture in Zanzibar, simply from not being able to hold slaves like his Arab neighbour!. The following are the rates of daily wages Muccadum (overseer) 4 annas (Bombay money), adult labourer from 2 to 2^ annas. 6. Possibly slaves are hired from their masters, or, what is more probable, contracts for the work to be done are given to persons holding slaves. But I am told this practice\ is general among the European and American merchants in Zanzibar; when a case of a British protected subject hiring slaves from their master is brou-ht to the notice of the Consul, he interferes to break the arrangement. If, however, it were held criminal to employ slaves either on in-door or out-door work at Zanzibar, it would, under the existing state of things, be almost impossible for Banians or Englishmen to live on the island. But whatever may be the practices resorted to by Banians and other foreigners to obtain labour, 4t requires a strong prejudice to believe even for a moment that all the Negroes employed by them are their slaves. 7^ Such is the information I have obtained from the Banians with regard to their connec tion with slavery in Zanzibar, and this information has been confirmed by independent and most reliable authotity. I have questioned the Banians collectively and individually, and they all ha^e declared that they do not deal in or own s!avest After this declaration what more can we expect them to do? How can we, without taking any steps to prove them guilty, persistently accuse them of the crime of slavery ? If I am not wrong. Her Majesty s Consul is competent to deal, and he does deal with it in the same way as a Magistrate or Judge deals with crime within his cognizance. It is then clear that if any of t e Banians break the law they do so through the want of adequate supervision 00 the part of the British Authorities. 8. With regard to the connection said to exist between the Banians and the slave- trade, on which much has lately been said, it is necessary to understand the circumstances under which the trade of Zanzibar is carried on. There are no Arabs who are known exclusively to be slave importers. Those who bring slaves to the Coast from the interior also bring ivory, copal, hides, and other merchandize as occasion may offer. Arab merchants receive advances in goods and money, not only from Banians, but also from the five or six European and American houses in Zanzibar, which, I am told, do about one-half of the business. No stipulation as to slaves one way or another is made from beginning to end, money or goods being the things advanced, and ivory, hides, or money received in repayment. Cases are sometimes taken before Her Majesty's Consul arising out of these transactions, but in no recent case has it been discovered that any understanding with regard to slaves existed between the Arab merchant and his creditor. Arabs know well that with such an understanding Banians could not recover their money m the Court; and they would not be slow to take advantage of this knowledge to impose their own terms on their creditors in disputed cases. C643FDi8 q Tn the majority of cases the advances are repaid in goods, and someti mes It is well known that the Arab merchants employ these ad v ances as well f dvanc ^ and other merchandize as slaves. But when, after having rcc r ontrnl of the lender at Zanzibar, an Arab leaves for the interior, he is no longer under the control^ and as in his eyes one investment is as legitimate as the o e , ou | d f eel bound by lender to stipulate his abstaining from obtaining slaves.^ *0 Arab^ such a condition, and if an y dld enter ,nto 1 \ t , her V V0 '^ u o1 ^ RrW subiects who J aithfullv observe it. Under the circumstances, the effect of holding British sub] » . advance goo/s aid money to Arab merchants guilty of part.c.pat^ ,n the s ave- rade would undoubtedly be to drive the legitimate trade of the East Coast of Africa e y into the hands of Americans, Germans and others, over whom we have no c , should lose the trade and gain nothing. 10 Among the goods supplied to Arab merchants are muskets and powder, which are undoubtedly used for capturing slaves in the interior, as well as is the defence o ie merchants' persons and property. It must, however, be borne in mind that no one whohas a rag to lose, much less a merchant with valuable goods such as are much coveted y savages, can venture into the interior of Africa without means of defence. Moreover, the e is an unlimited demand for these articles among the Negroes themselves, who often accept them in preference to other goods in exchange for ivory. 11. But the share of the Banians in the trade of muskets and powder is that of mi'ddlemen. The principals are the European and American merchants at Zanzibar, who order from their respective countries the kind of articles required, and sell them to the Banians, who retail them along with prints from Manchester, beads from France, mericance and dyed cloth trom America, etc., yet little is said of these merchants in connection with the slave-trade, while the Banians are constantly held up as criminal for their share in what is a legitimate branch of trade. 12. It is not my object to defend the Baniaos. I know that they do not regard slavery as a moral crime. Possibly there are a few among them who evade the law. But I do think it hard for them to be persistently accused, without enquiry, of serious crimes in general when they declare themselves to be innocent. They have no opportunity of defending themselves, even if they know when and by whom they are accused. 1 will cite a few instances to show how necessary it is to thoroughly investigate the whole subject^ Dr. Lhingstone has published it to the world that the men with whom supplies were sent to him (in 1870 or 1871) from Zanzibar were slaves of Banians, and that their masters were to receive all, and themselves not a cent, of their wages. Nor I have satisfied myself that in this matter the Doctor was misinformed. In one of his published betters he says :—' I had no idea before how blood-thirsty men can be when they can pour out the blood of fellow-men in safety. And all this carnage is going on in Manjnema at the very time I write. It is the Banians, our protected Indian subjects, that indirectly do it all!' But on enquiry I find that from the regions west of the Tanganika, whence the Doctor wrote, if any slaves come to the East Coast. In auother letter Dr. Livingstone sa y S: —it is not to be overlooked that most of other trade, as well as slaving, is carried on by Banians. 13. As to 'most other trade' I have already stated what share of the trade of Zanzi bar is in the hands of European and American merchants. If letters do not reach the Doctor, it is the Banians who intercept and distroy them. But from what we have read of the interior of Africa the wonder is that any letters reach him at all. Philanthropy is not incompatible with justice, and it is the duty of the British Government to order a searching enquiry into the whole subject, and punish severely those who may be found guilty, instead of allowing the whole Indian community at Zanzibar to be execrated and reviled by the world at the principal agents in the work of courage and kindnapping 01 Negro races. 14. His Highness the Rao of Kutch has requested the Government of Bombay to order enquiries to be made to ascertain which, if any, of his subjects at Zanzibar are really guilty of that share in the slave-trade which Doctor Livingstone has imputed to them. He is naturally anxious that the name of his country should not be mixed up, as it has of late been, with this horrible crime. It is due to him that his request should be granted. It has been stated by one witness before the Committee of the House of Commons that domestic slavery prevails in Kutch; and a Bombay paper has informed the public that Kutch is a centre of the Slave-trade. I beg to state that both these statements are simply untrue. 15- ^ b®? to offer the following suggestions for the purpose of detecting and punishing the crime of slavery and slave-trade among the British protected subjects among His Highness'the Sultan's dominions An enquiry into (c) suspected cases of holding slaves, and (£) business transactions with Arab merchants. 2nd, resume of the law of slavery, with rules such as the result of the above enquiry might suggest, to be printed in English and Guzerathi, and distributed at Zanzibar and on the Coast.19 Constant, supervision.

FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. P olitical. Simla, the ijtk June 1873. t R- e SOLUTION.— Read the following letters, dated 15th of May 1873, from Her Majes ty s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India, and to the Political Agent at Zanzibar, respectively:— 'To the Duke of Argyll, Kt., 4&lt; My Lord Duke,— The reports of Sir ^1. Bartle Frere having established beyond all question that great numbers of Her Majesty's Indian subjects are more or less directly implicated in the Slave Trade, it has been my duty, in obedience to Her Majesty's Com mands, to send to Her Majesty's Consul at Zanzibar the instructions, of which I enclose a copy, directing him, under the powers vested in him by Order in Council, to adopt the most decided measures for the apprehension and punishment of any subjects of Her Majesty directly or indirectly engaged in the Slave Trade. ' In pursuance of this instruction Her Majesty's Consul may be expected to send to Bombay for trial, before the High Court of that Presidency, subjects of Her Majesty who may be brought before him charged with such offences ; and 1 have the honour to request that Your Grace will communicate a copy of my instruction to the Viceroy of India, to the intent that His Excellency may apprise the Governor of Bombay thereof, and direct him to co-operate in carrying out the determination of Her Majesty to spare no pains to relieve the British name from the stigma which now unfortunately attaches to it by reason of the large participation of British subjects in the East African Slave Trade. ' It will be for the Viceroy of India to consider whether, as it is supposed that the British subjects carrying on this trade on the East Coast of Africa are in communication with parties in Her Majesty's Indian Dominions, some public notice such as Her Majesty's Consul is directed to issue might not conveniently be published in India. ' I have, &amp;c., ' (Signed) GRANVILLE.' ' To Dr. Kirk, ' sir,— The reports made by Sir Bartle Frere of the results of his investigation into the state of the Slave Trade in the Dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar establish the complicity of British subjects in that nefarious traffic, and impose upon Her Majesty's Government the obligation to use the utmost endeavours to relieve the British name from the scandal and disgrace which their unlawful practices bring upon it. I have, therefore, to direct your particular attention to the 16th and 23rd Clauses of the Order in Council of the 4th of November 1867*, by which you are empowered to deal with British subjects engaged in, or being accessory to, the purchase or sale of slaves, or having slaves illegally in their possession j and I have to enjoin you to cause all such British subjects, against whom you can obtain sufficient evidence as having been engaged in such practices, to be brought before you, and thereupon to deal with them according to the powers vested in you by the Order in Council. &lt;f I send you, herewith, copies of the Acts of Parliament now in force, defining the crime of slave-dealing and the punishment to which British subjects engaged in it are made liable. ' The crime itself is of so serious a character, and the punishments to which persons convicted of it are amenable are so severe, that it may probably be desirable in the majori ty of cases to remit the parties accused for trial in the High Court of Bombay; but, in regard to this, much must be left to your discretion. • Note that the Order in Council in force in Zanzibar dominions at this time was that of 9th August 18661 while the Order in Council of 9th November 1867 applies only to Maskat dominions (Aitchison's Treaties, Volume XI, page CLV).20 « y ou w iii g ; V e the greatest publicity to the instructions contained in this despatch, a copy of which will be sent to the Viceroy of India. ' I have, ^c., GRANVILLE.' f{ (Signed) O bservations.— The Governor-General in Council, in accordance with the instructions, has taken into consideration the present state of the law affecting persons connected with the Slave Trade. 2. In Sections 367, 370, and 371 of the Indian Penal Code, it is provided as follows ' 3^7. Whoever kidnaps or abducts any person, in order that such person may be sub jected or may be so disposed of as to be put in danger of being subjected to grievous l urt, or slavery, or to the unnatural lust of any person, or knowing it to be likely that such person will be so subjected or disposed of, shall be punished with imprisonment of either deSi-np- tion for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine, ' 370. Whoever imports, exports, removes, buys, sells or disposes of any person as a slave, or accepts, receives, or detains against his will any person as a slave, shc.il ce punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.' ' 371. Whoever habitually imports, exports, removes, buys, sells, traffics, or deals in. slaves shall be punished with transportation for life, or with imprisonment of either descrip tion for a term not exceeding ten years, and shall also be liable to fine,' 3. In Sections 107 to 120 of the Indian Penal Code the abetment of offences is defined, and penalties are prescribed for such abetment. 4. In the Foreign Jurisdiction and Extradition Act, 1872 (Act XI of 1872), it is, among other things, provided as follows ' 8. The law relating to offences and to criminal procedure for the time being in force in British India shall, subject as to procedure to such modifications as the Governor- General in Council from time to time directs, extend to all British subjects, European and Native, in Native States, ' 9. All British subjects, European and Native, in British India may be dealt with, ia respect of offences committed by them in any Native State, as if such offences had been committed in any place within British India in which any such subject may be, or may be found. 5. In the aforesaid Act, the expression ' Native State ' means— ' in reference to Native Indian subjects of Her Majesty, all places without and beyond the Indian territories under the dominion of Her Majesty ; and ' in reference to European British subjects, the dominions of Princes and States in India in alliance with Her Majesty.' 6. The aforesaid Act makes provision for the exercise of certain powers by the Governor-General of India in Council in places beyond British India, for the delegation of such powers and for the appointment of Justices of the Peace in such places ; and under these provisions the Governor-General in Council has this day issued a Notification, appointing the Commissioner in Siad, the Political Agent in Kelat, the Assistant Politi cal Agent at Gwadur, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent at Muscat, the Resident at Aden, and the Political Agent at Zanzibar, holding these offices for the time being, and being European British subjects, to be Justices of the Peace within the territories beyond the limits of British India in which they are respectively accredited as the representatives of the British Government. 7. The English Statute Law relating to the Slave Trade is set forth in 5, George IV, Cap. 113, and 6 and 7 Vict., Cap. 98, which Statutes apply to all British subjects. 8. In an Order of Her Majesty in Council, dated the 4th of November 1867, relating to Consular Jurisdiction at Muscat, it is, among other things, provided as follows ' 16. And it is further ordered that in any case in which any British subject shall be accused before Her Majesty's Consul of the crime of arson or house-breaking, or cutting and maiming, or stabbing or wounding, or of any assault endangering life, or of wilfully causing any bodily injury dangerous to life, or of wilful or corrupt perjury, or of engaging in, or being accessory to, the purchase or sale of slaves, or of having slaves illegally in his possession, the proceedings before the Consul shall be carried on with the aid of assessors convened in the manner aforesaid, and it shall be lawful for the Consul, if to him it shall seem fit, to cause any person convicted before him of any of the crimes aforesaid, over and above any fine or imprisonment which may be awarded to such person, to be sent out of the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat for such time as to him shall seem meet in the man-31 ner pointed out in the next preceding Article of this Order, notwithitanding the crime laid to the charge of such person may be the first of which he has been convicted before the Consul. ' 23. And it is further ordered that it shall be lawful for Her Majesty's Consul to cause any British subject charged with the commission of any crime or offence, the cognizance whereof may at any time appertain to him, to be sent in any of Her Majesty's ships of war, or in any British vessel, to Her Majesty's territory of Bombay, for trial before the High Court of the said territory ; and it shall be lawful for the Commander of any of Her Majesty's ships of war, or of any British vessel, to receive any such person on board with a warrant from the said Consul addressed to the Chief Magistrate of Police of the said terri tory, and thereupon to keep and detain in lawful custody and to convey him in custody to Bombay, and on his arrival there to deliver him, with the said warrant, into the custody of the said Chief Magistrate of Police, or other officer within the said territory lawfully acting as such, who, on receipt of the said warrant, and of the party therein named, shall be authorized to commit, and shall commit, such party so sent for trial to the Common Goal of the said ter ritory ; and it shall be lawful for the Keeper of the said Common Goal to cause such party to be detained in safe and proper custody^ and to be produced upon the Order of the said High Court, and the High Court at the Sessions to be holden next after such committal shall pro ceed to hear and determine the charge against such party, and to punish him for the same, if found guilty, in the same manner as if the crime with which he may be charged has been committed within Her Majesty's said territory of Bombay.' 9. In an Order of Her Majesty in Council of the same date, relating to Consular Jurisdic* tion at Zanzibar, similar provisions are contained. Order .—Ordered that the following Proclamation be published in the Gazette of India:— PROCLAMATION, Whereas In Sections 367, 370, and 371 of the Indian Penal Code, it is provided as follows :— ' 367. Whoever kidnaps or abducts any person, in order that such person may be sub jected or may be so disposed of as to be put in danger of being subjected to grievous hurt, or slavery, or to the unnatural lust of any person, or knowing it to be likely that such person will be so subjected or disposed of, shall be punished with imprisonment of either descrip tion for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine. ' 370. Whoever imports, exports, removes, buys, sells, or disposes of any person as a slave, or accepts, receives, or detains against his will any person as a slave, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine. '371. Whoever habitually imports, exports, removes, buys, sells, traffics, or deals in slaves shall be punished with transportation for life, or with imprisonment of either -description for a term not exceeding ten years, and shall also be liable to fine';— And whereas in Sections 107 to 120 of the Indian Penal Code the abetment of offences is defined and penalties are prescribed for such abetment And whereas the English Statute Law relating to the Slave Trade is set forth in 5, Geo. IV, Cap. 113, and 6 and 7 Vict., Cap. y8, which Statutes apply to all British sub jects ;— Therefore the Governor-General of India in Council hereby notifies, for the infor mation of all persons concerned, that any person or persons who may violate the provi sions of the Indian Penal Code above recited or referred to, or the provisions of the afore said Statutes, 5, Geo. IV, Cap. 113, and 6 and 7 Vict., Cap. 98, shall forfeit all claim to the protection of the British Government, and shall be liable to all the penalties of the Law provided jn that behalf. 3y Order of the Governor-General of India in Council, C. U. AITCHISON, Secretary to the Government of India* 5-A. In regard to subjects of Native States in India, we must read paragraphs 113, 120, 121 and 124 of Major Henderson's Precis of Zanzibar Affiairs, Chapter VI (Slave Trade), which deals with the right of the Kutchees to hold slaves and engage in slave traffic. The effect of the proclamation issued by the Rao of Kutch in 1869 was to place them in the same position as the British Indian subjects in respect to his responsibilities and liabilities to penalties as well as the;ir right. ^643 ( FD23 The slave trade treaties of .873 signed by the Sultans of Maskat and Zanzibar prohibits natives of Indian States under British protection from fassess- ing slaves and from acquiring any fresh slaves. 6. With a view to the effectual suppression of the slave trade, the Govern ment of India considered it desirable:— Political A., June 1873, No. 487. ' That all subjects of the British Government and of Native ^ tates ' n within the Maskat territories may commit offences against the slave-tra e av , amenable to the jurisdiction of the Political Agent at Maskat, With this object the Political Resident was thus addressed ' Jurisdiction over British subjects is already provided for by the Treaty of 1839 and Her Majesty 's Order in Council, dated 4th November 1867. But as regards the subjects of Native States, who, like the Kutchees, appear to be greatly implicated, mdirectly at least, in the slave-trade, the Political Agent's jurisdiction would appear to be detective without the express consent of His Highness the Sultan. His Excellency in Council accordingly thinks it desirable that you should 0 htain from His Highness a formal agreement to the effect that subjects of Native States of India who may commit offences within the Maskat dominions shall be amenable ^ to the Folmcal Agent's Court in the same way as British subjects, if the Political Agent in any particular case thinks fit to exercise such jurisdiction 7. Syud Turki was addressed in accordance with these instructions, and on the 1st July the Political Resident wrote that Turki had signed and sealed the following agreement:— ' Whereas it is desirable that all subjects of Native State in India residing in Maskat territories should be amenable to the jurisdiction of the Political Agent and Council at Maskat, and it would appear that such jurisdiction is at present defective without the ex press consent of His Highness the Sultan, It is hereby formally declared and consented to by His Highness Syud Turki bin Said on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors, that subjects of Native States of India who may commit offences within the Maskat dominions shall be amenable to the Political Agent and Councils Court in the same way as British subjects whenever, in any particular case, the Political Agent thinks fit to exercise such jurisdiction, and that the words ' British subjectsin all Treaties between the English Government and the Maskat State shall include subjects of Native Indian States.' 7 -A. Cases having occurred in which it appeared that the High Court of „ Bombay had not jurisdiction over certain Political A., April 1874, No. (50. J .. . J r, , • persons resident in Zanzibar but subjects of Princes or States of India, the following notification was issued on the ist April 1874 :— ' Whereas the Governor General in Council has, within the dominions of His High ness the Sultan of Zanzibar, jurisdiction to try and punish British subjects and the subjects of Princes and States of India in alliance with Her Majesty for the offences of the description referred to in Sections 367, 370 and 371 of the Indian Penal Code, and for abetting the commission of the same, and whereas the said Governor in Council has power to delegate the said jurisdiction, and it is expedient to delegate the same in part to a British officer at Zanzibar. ' The Governor-General in Council accordingly is pleased hereby to delegate to the Political Agent at Zanzibar for the time being for the trial of persons of the said classes committing or abetting ths commission of offences of the said descriptions, the powers of Deputy Commissioner under section 36 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and to obtain that every sentence passed in the exercise to such powers shall be valid without such confirmation being required as is prescribed in certain cases by the said section 36. 'Any person aggrieved by any order passed by the Political Agent in the exercise of the powers hereby conferred on him, may forward an appeal in writing to the Governor- General in Council within six months from the date of such order. The Go\ernor-General in Council reserves to himself in all cases tried under this notification and coming before him, whether an appeal or otherwise, the fullest powers conferred upon any Court of Appeal, superintendence or revision by the Criminal Procedure Code. S. In 1876 the British Parliament passed an Act (39 and 40 Vict., C. 46) for more effectually punishing offences against the laws relating to the slave trade, providing that a subject of Her Majesty or any Prince or State in India in alliance with Her Majesty committing offences under sections 367, 370 and ^71 of the Indian Penal Code upon the high seas or in any part of Asia or Africa to be specified by an Order in Council, shall be dealt with as if the same had23 been committed in any part within British India in which he may be or may not be found. 9 By an Order in Council, dated 30th April 1877, it was declared that the u * 1 ** t* tr , V i„ Act last mentioned should apply to the Hertslet'i Treaties, Volume XIV, page looS. &lt;■ n • • • J tollowing territories:— (a) The territories of the Khan of Kelat and of the Sultan of Maskat in Mekran and Arabia, (b) The coast of Baluchistan, and of the Bunder Abbas districts and the shores of the Persian Gulf.

Progressive organization of the administrative, judicial, religious and military services in the African territories placed under the sovereignty as protectorate of civilized nations. _ 2. The gradual establishment in the interior by the Powers to which the territories are subject of strongly occupied stations, in such a way as to make their protective or repressive action effectively felt in the territories devastated by slave- hunting. 3. The construction of roads, and in particular of railways, connecting the advanced stations with the coast, and permitting easy access to the 'inland waters, and to such of the upper courses of the rivers and streams as are broken by rapids and cataracts, in view of substituting economical and rapid means of transport for the present means of carriage by men. 4. Establishment of steam-boats on the inland navigable waters and on the lakes supported by fortified posts established on the banks. 5. Establishment of telegraphic lines insuring the communication of the posts and stations with the coast and with administrative centres. 6. Organization of expeditions and flying columns, to keep up the communication of the stations with each other and with the cost, to support repressive action, and to insure the security of high roads. 7. Restriction of the importation of fire-arms, at least of modern pattern and of ammunition throughout the entire extent of the territories infected by the Slave Trade. Chapter 1 l,-~~Caravan Routes and the Land Transport of Slaves, ARTICLE XV. • Independently of the repressive or protective action which they exercise in the centre of the Salve Trade, the stations, cruizers, and posts, the establishment of which is provided for in Article 11, and all other stations established or recognized bv Article IV by each Government in its possessions, will furthermore have the mission of supervising so far as circumstances will permit, and in proportion to the progress of their administrative organization, the roads followed on their territory by the slave- dealers, there to stop the convoys in their march, or to pursue them wherever their action can be legally exercised. ARTICLE XVII. A rigorous watch shall be organized by the local authorities at the ports and places near the coast in view of preventing the sale and shipping of the slaves brought from the interior, as well as the formation and departure landwards of the banrk of slave-hunters and dealers. Caravans arriving at the coast or in its vicinity, as well as those arriving in the interior at a locality occupied by the territorial Power, shall, on their arrival be submitted to a minute inspection as to the persons composing them. Any such person being ascertained to have been captured or carried off by force or mutilated, either in his native place or on the way, shall be liberated. Chapter 111.—Repression of the Sea-Borne Slave Trade. § /. General Provisions* ARTICLE XX.

ARTICLE XXVIII. Any slave who may have taken refuge on board a ship of war bearing the flag of one of the Signatory Powers shall be immediately and definitively liberated; such liberation, however, cannot operate to withdraw him from the competent jurisdiction if he has been guilty of any crime or offence at common law. ARTICLE XXIX. Every slave detained against his wish on board a native vessel shall have the 'right to claim his liberty. His liberation may be pronounced by any Agent of any of the Signatory Powers, on whom the present General Act confers the right of ascertaining the status of persons on board such vessels, without this liberation having the effect of withdrawing him from the competent jurisdiction if he has committed any crime or offence at common law. § //.

The list of the negro passengers. These documents, the tenour of which may vary according to the different Regula- lations of each country, shall necessarily contain the following particulars, drawn up in one of the European languages :— 1. As regards the authorization to carry the flag: (a) The name, tonnage, rig, and the principal dimensions of the ressel ; (i) The register number and the signal letter of the port of registry; (&lt;:) The date of obtaining the license, and the office held by the person who has issued it. 2.

The provisions of the present Article only concern the papers intended for native vessels. a. The Stopping of Suspected Vessels. ARTICLE XLII. When the officers in command of war-vessel (' batiments de guerre ') of any of the Signatory Powers have reason to believe that a vessel of tonnage less than 500 tons, and found navigating in the above-indicated zone, takes part in the Slave Trade, or is guilty of the fraudulent use of a flag, they may proceed to the verification of ship's papers. The present Article does not imply any change in the present state of things as regards jurisdiction in territorial waters. ARTICLE XLIX, If, in carrying out the supervision mentioned in the preceding Articles, the officer in command of the cruizer is convinced that an act of Slave Trade has been committed on board during the passage, or that irrefutable proofs exist against the captain or fitter-out for accusing him of fraudulent use of the flag, of fraud, or participation in Slave Trade, he shall conduct the arrested vessel to the nearest port of the zone where there is a competent authority of the Power whose flag has been used. Each Signatory Power undertakes to appoint in the zone, and to make known the same at the International Information Office, the territorial or Consular authorities or Special Delegates who are competent in the above-mentioned cases. The suspected vessel can also, should the case occur, be handed over to a cruizer of its own nation if the latter consents to take charge of it. J. Of the Examination into and Trial of Vessels seized. ARTICLE L. The authority referred to in the preceding Article, to which the arrested vessel has been handed over, shall proceed to make a full investigation, according to the Laws and Rules of his country, in the presence of an officer belonging to the foreign cruizer, ARTICLE LI. If it is proved by the inquiry that the flag has been fraudulently used, the arrested vessel shall remain at the disposal of its captor. ARTICLE LI I. If the examination shows that an act of Slave Trade, made clear by the presence on board of slaves destined for sale, or any other Slave Trade offence provided for by special Convention, the vessel and cargo shall remain sequestrated in charge of the authority who shall have directed the inquiry. The captain and crew shall be handed over to the Tribunals fixed by Articles LIV and LVI. The slaves shall be set at liberty as soon as the judgment has been delivered. In the cases provided for by this Article liberated slaves shall be disposed of in accordance with special Conventions concluded or to be concluded between the Signatory Powers. In default of such Conventions, the said slaves shall be handed over to the local authority, to be sent back, if possible, to their country of origin ; if not, this authority shall facilitate for them, in so far as may be in its power, the means of livelihood, and, if they desire it, of setting on the spot. ARTICLE LIII. If it should be proved by the inquiry that the vessel has been illegally arrested, clear title will have been shown to an indemnity in proportion to the damages suffered by the vessel being taken out of its course The amount of this indemnity shall be fixed by the authority which has directed the inquiry.32 ARTICLE LIV. In case the officer of the capturing vessel do not accept the conclusions of the inquiry carried on in his presence, the matter shall be handed over to the 1 ribunal of the nation whose flag the captured vessel had borne. No exception shall be made to this rule, unless the disagreement arises in respect of the amount of the indemnity stipulated in Article L1II, and this shall be fixed by arbi tration, as specified in the following Article. ARTICLE LV. The capturing office and the authority which has directed the inquiry shall each appoint a referee within forty-eight hours and the two arbiters shall have twenty-four hours to choose an umpire. The arbiters shall, as far as possible, be chosen from among Diplomatic, Consular, or Judicial officers of the Signatory Powers. Natives in the pay of the Contracting Governments are formally excluded. 1 he decision shall be taken by the majority of votes, and be considered as final. If the Court of Arbitration is not constituted in the time indicated, the procedure in respect of the indemnity, as in that tor the damages, shall bain accordance with the provisions of Article LVIII, paragraph 2. ARTICLE LVI. The cases shall be sent forward with the briefest possible delay to the Tribunal of the nations whose colours have been used by the accused. However, the Consuls or any other authority of the same nation as the accused, specially commissioned to this end, may be authorized by their Government to deliver judgment instead of the Tribunal. ARTICLE LVII. The procedure and judgment of offences against the provisions of Chapter III shall always be conducted in as summary a manner as is permitted by the Laws and Regulations in force in the territories subject to the authority of the Signatory Powers. ARTICLE LVIII. Any judgment of the national Tribunal or authorities referred to by Article LXI, declaring that the seized vessel did not carry on Slave Trade shall be immediately put in force, and the vessel shall be altogether free to continue its course. In this case the captain or owner of any vessel seized without legitimate ground of suspicion, or which has been subjected to annoyance, shall have the right of claiming damages, the amount of which shall be fixed by agreement between the Governments directly interested, or by arbitrationj and shall be paid within a period of six months from the date of the judgment acquitting the captured vessel. ARTICLE LIX. In case of condemnation, the sequestered vessel shall be declared lawfully seized for the benefit of the captor. The captain, crew, and all other persons found guilty shall be punished according to the gravity of the crimes or offences committed by them, and in accordance with Article V, ARTICLE LX. The provision of Articles L to LIX do not affect in any way the jurisdiction or pro cedure of existing special Tribunals, or of those which may hereafter be formed to take cognizance of Slave Trade offences. ARTICLE LXI. The High Contracting Parties undertake to make known to each other reciprocally the instructions which they shall give to carry out the provisions of Chepter IU to the Commanders of their men-of-war navigating the seas of the zone referred to. Chapter JV.—Countries to which slaves are sent, whose institutions recognize the existence of domestic slavery, ARTICLE LXI I. The Contracting Powers whose institutions recognize the existence of domestic slavery and whose possessions, in consequence thereof, in or out of Africa, serve, in spite of the vigilance of the authorities, as places of destination for African slaves, pledge themselves to prohibit their importation, transit, and departure, as well as Trade in Slaves. They shall organize the most active and the strictest supervision at all places where the arrival, transit, and departure of African slaves takes place.33 ARTICLE LXIII. Slaves liberated under the provisions of the preceding Article shall, if circumstances permit, be sent back to the country from whence they came. In all cases they shall receive letters of liberation from the competent authorities, and shall be entitled to their protection and assistance for the purpose of obtaining means of subsistence. ARTICLE LXIV. t vrT EverV fu ^ itive s,ave arri ving at the frontier of any of the Powers mentioned in Article LXII shall be considered free and shall have the right to claim letters of liberation from the competent authorities. ARTICLE LXV. Any sale or transaction to which the slaves referred to in Articles LXIII and LXIV may have been subjected through circumstances of any kind whatsoever shall be consi dered as null and void. ARTICLE LXVI. Native vessels bearing the flag of one of the countries mentioned in Article LXII, if there is any indication that they are employed in Slave Trade operations, shall be sub mitted by the local authorities in the ports frequented by them to a rigorous verification of their crew and passengers both at arrival and departure. Should African slaves be on board, judicial proceedings shall betaken against the vessel and against all persons who may be implicated. Slaves found on board shall receive letters of liberation through the authoriiies who have carried out the seizure of the vessels. ARTICLE LXVII. Penal provisions in connection with those provided for by Article V shall be published against persons importing, transporting, and trading in African slaves, against the muti lators of children or of male adults, and those who traffic in them, as well as against their associates and accomplices. ARTICLE LXVIII. The Signatory Powers recognized the great importance of the law respecting the prohibition of the Slave I rade sanctioned by His Majesty the Emperor of the Ottomans of the 4th (16th) December 1889 (22 Rebi-ul-Akhir, 1307), and they are assured that an active supervision will be organized by the Ottoman authorities, especially on the west coast of Arabia and on the routes which place this coast in communication with the other possessions of His Imperial Majesty in Asia. ARTICLE LXIX. His Majesty the Shah of Persia consents to organize an active supervision in the territorial waters and those off the coast of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman which are under his sovereignty, and on the inland routes which serve for the transp ut of slaves. The Magistrates and other authorities shall, with this view, receive the necessary powers. ARTICLE LXX. His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar consents to give his most effective support for the repression of crimes and offences committed by African slave-traders on land as well as at sea. The Tribunals created for this purpose in the Sultanate Zanzibar shall rigorously apply the penal provisions mentioned in Article V. In order the better to insure the freedom of liberated slaves, both in virtue of the provisions of the present General Act and of the Decrees adopted in this matter by His Highness and his predecessors, a Liber ation Office shall be established at Zanzibar. ARTICLE LXXI. Diplomatic and Consular Agents and the naval officers of the Contracting Powers shall, within the limits of existing Conventions, give their assistance to the local authorities in order to assist in repressing the Slave Trade where it still exists They shall be entitled to be present at trials for slave-trading brought about at their instance, without being, however, entitled to take part in the deliberations. 14. On nth January 1892, the Foreign Office informed the India Office o t p. w . c „ v, ^at the ratifications of the oreneral act of Secret E., March 1895, Nos. 217-245. ,1 D ^ n c 11^ r n the Brussels Conference had been formally- deposited by all the powers including Persia and Turkey except Portugal and the United States, the formal consent of whose legislatures had yet to be obtained. C643FD34 The Act was to come into force on the 2nd March 1892. It came into force actually on 2nd April 1892. The French Government had made certain reserva tions with regard to the articles conceding the right of search of vessels, which are the most effectively important part of the Act so far as regards the provisions for the suppression of the sea-borne Slave Trade. 15. Forms were prescribed by the Government of India under the Act in Secret e, March 1893, Nos. 317-345 (Nos. their letters to the Governments of Bombay, 342.343). Madras, Bengal and Burma (Nos. 1481-E. and 1482-E., dated 9th August 1892 for (1) License to carry the British flag granted under Article XXXII. (2) List of crew granted under Article XXXV, (3) List of negro passengers granted under Article XXXVI. (iii) Right of vessels of Native States in India to fly the British flag under the opera tions of the Brussels Act. 16. The above question was first raised in 1888, and was finally determined after the Brussels Act came into force. 17. In 1888, in their letter No. 1588, dated the 2nd March 1888, the Bombay . t , * t 1 q QQ m Government addressed the Government of Internal A., July 1888, Nos. 393-04. x i* .1 1 • r 1 • , , , India on the subject of the rights and obli gations of the owners and crews of vessels trading with foreign countries, who are subjects of Native States in subordinate alliance with Her Majesty ; and made the following suggestions :— (1) ' The most obvious solution of the difficulty seems to be distinct recognition of vessels, belonging to the subjects of the maritime or other States in subordinate alliance with Her Majesty, and plying beyond the local limits of those States, as British vessels which must be registered at a British post' (paragraph 7). {2) n In order to enable the Indian Government to provide Indian ships of Native States with the requisite safeguards, it ought to be empowered to issue certificates, such as are issued under Her Majesty's Order in Council at Zanzibar, to the owners of such ships, and this would require fresh legislation '' (paragraph 8). 18. The Government of India's reply (No. 2819-!., dated the 1 ith July 1888) pointed out that the questions discussed appeared to have been raised only in connection with Kutch ships and Kutch subjects and added ' until His Highness the Rao requests that Kutch vessels may be brought under British Indian law, it would seem to the Government of India undesirable to move in the matter of their registration as to take measures with a view to bringing the crews under British jurisdiction.' 19. In Government of India's No. 1064.E., dated the 21st May 1891, the internal a., june 1891, Nos. 15 -19, Bombay Government was asked for their . . . . , , views as to the steps to be taken to carry out the provisions of the General Act of the Brussels Conference. The Bombay External a ., October 1891, Nos. 18-39. Government's reply No. 5304, dated the , , , . cth J^y 1891, referred to the 1888 cor respondence and expressed an opinion ' that under Act 32 of the General Act r v u i Government has no power to authorise a Kutch vessel to carry the sense intended'by 0 1he Act^' U 0Wner 13 ^ PerSOn in the di P lomatic 20. It was pointed out that the Government of India's letter of the 10th July internal a., July 1888, Nos. 43-94 (No. 94). 1 88b contended the Kutch vessels pos- r 11. sessed and independent character and .-eferenc 6 was also made to .ts letter No 3816 -I.. dated (he 25th Sept'ember .888, on the subject of an application by Kutch owners for a certificate of naturahsation. In that letter n was suggested that the applicants might be told Act X orTs.tf h erty - t ° avai , i them3elves of'he provisions of Section 24 of . , , 7 S lvl ng the command of their vessel to a subiect o't Hpr Majesty, and that they might obtain letters of naturalisation by complying 'th35 the requirements of Act XXX of 1852. The Bombay Government still desired to recommend the course suggested in 1888 (paragraph 17 above), and said that the principle that the sea-board Native States of India in subordinate a nance with Her Majesty should for the purposes of maritime police and external re ations be treated as a part of Her Majesty's Indian empire appears worthy of consideration.' J 21. Attention was invited by the Bombay Government to the correspondence Secret e ., October 1890, n «s. 1 -14 (Nos 1 -4). rec ^ ved from the India Office regarding a desire expressed by the German Govern ment to extend their protection and jurisdiction over such subjects of Indian Native States as were not registered at the British Consulate at Zanzibar and were to be found in the German protected territories in East Africa. In this correspondence Pvutch subjects were taken as an instance. Lord Cross's view was that the subjects of any British Indian protected State were under the pro tection of the British Government when out of India ! The Bombay Govern ment were of opinion that the provisions of General Act rendered an alteration of Act X of 1841 necessary ; they pointed out that the resemblance of the Kutch •Red with sun and moon. flag* to the Turkish, Egyptian and Arab ensigns would especially invite visitation of Kutch vessels, and that ' in order to obtain fair consideration, Kutch vessels mast hoist the British ensign, and consequently the removal of legal difficulties to that course is the first step to be taken.' 22. In letter No. 3 I 44t dated the 14th May 1892, the Bombay Government enquired whether, apart from legislation, sanction could not be given to a form of license to carry the British flag. And with their No. 3372, dated the 23rd May 1892, Bombay Government forwarded a letter (with enclosure) from the Political Agent, Kutch, regarding proposals by the Kutch Darbar in respect to— (i) the alteration of the Kutch flag ; (ii) amendations of, or additions to, the forms previously used by ship owners. Further reports from Kutch were forwarded with the Bombay Government letter No. 3634, dated the 4th June 1892, explaining that it was only intended to alter the Kutch flag so as to prevent its being mistaken for the Turkish. 23. The views of the Government of India were expressed in Foreign De- Secret e „ March 1893, Nos. 317-245. Pfrtment letter No. 20S3.E, dated 7th November 1892 :— Two distinct questions appear to arise for decision, viz, :— (i) whether subjects of a Native State in India are proteges ' of the protecting power within the meaning of Article XXXII of the General Act of the Brussels Conference, in which case permission to fly the British flag can, under that article, be granted to vessels of such Native States ; and (ii) whether our own Municipal Law, as it at present stands, enables us to grant this permission, and if not, what alteration of it is required for the purpose. On the first of these points I am to say that the Government of India are advised that subjects of Native States in India can be held to be 14 protected persons for the purposes of the General Act.' As regards the second question, I am to remark that there does not appear to be any statutory authority enabling the Government of India to grant permission to fly the British flag in ships, which are not British ships or by persons who are not British subjects, except under the provisions of Act X of 1841, as amended by subsequent enactments, but neither does there appear to be any authoritative prohibition of such grants ; and 1 am to add that the question of regulating such grants by the introduction of a clause in the pending Merchant Shipping Bill will be taken into consideration. Meantime there does not seem to be any objection to the grant of such permission in the case of vessels owned by subjects of Native State to which the privileges of a British ship have been, or may hereafter be, granted under the provisions of the Act above mentioned. There is no objection to the proposed alteration of the Kutch flag ; but it should be pointed out to the Darbar that the benefits of the General Act can only be claimed by vessels which not only are authorised to fly the British flag, but also comply strictly with the provi sions of the Act, and that the suggested modifications ot those provisions are consequently inadmissible.CHAPTER IV. Anti-Slave Trade Operations in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, 1874—1904. (i) Operation from 1874 to 1883. 24. We shall now see what operations were carried on by the^ British Gov ernment for the suppression of the Slave Trade in the Persian Gulf and the oulf of Oman in pursuance of the treaties and engagements with the Asiatic and African powers and their own Legislative enactments and orders. 25. The naval arrangements made are explained 'vn. Precis on Ncwal arrangements in the Persian Gulf, 26. In 1873, two Dhows were captured by the Nimble on suspicion of being engaged in Slave Trade and brought Political A., January .874, Nos. 217-^. ^ {or ad j udicat i on &gt;by t he Vice- Admiralty Court there. What was the result of the investigation it does not appear from our records. 27. The Government of India did not think it necessary to require a report in detail of the circumstances attending the capture of Slave Dhows, which operations were not within the control of this Government (Government of India to the Bombay Government, No. 14-?., dated 2nd January 1874). 28. In October 1875, Lieutenant-Colonel Miles, Political Agent at Maskat, Political B., December .875, No, 6.7. re P 0rt ? d du ™f thenar 1875 the im- portation or fresh slaves into the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat from East Africa was rery small. Not more than forty were known to have been landed, and it was probable that the total number imported did not exceed one hundred. Three Dhows arrived at Sur during April and May and landed a few slaves, about twenty altogether, they had brought up as part of their cargo. One of these vessels was owned by a native of Sur and a subject of the Sultan ; the other two belonged to the Pirate Coast, but they were all under French Colors having obtained papers at Nossi Be or Zanzibar, their object in this being doubtless to evade search by British Cruizers. Another batch of fifteen slaves was landed at Mattrah, a town two miles from Maskat, one night in May 1875, an( l ^he Dhow got away undetected. This vessel was under British Colors and unfortunately there was no man-of-war in the Gulf of Oman at the time. These were all the importations into Oman known to have occurred during the season. As regards the Persian Gulf it was reported that two or three slave Dhows had entered the Gulf only, one of which was a Turkish vessel bound from Jeddah to Basra or Kuwait and had a cargo of about 50 Abyssinian slaves, chiefly young girls and eunuchs on board. 29. During the first part of the season, from March to June in 1875, no watch was kept on the Oman coast, but since then a strict search was maintained by Her Majesty s ' Daphne ' and ' Rifleman,' under the direction of Captain C. E. Foot, Her Majesty's ' Daphne', the senior officer of the Persian Gulf Squadron. No captures however were made. 30. It was apparent that so far as the coast of Oman was concerned the old practice of running full cargoes of slaves had for the moment been altogether abandoned, the dealers preferring to ship the slaves in driblets and trust to con cealment or to passing them off as sailors when boarded by Her Majesty's ships. 3 1 - The import trade in slaves was, in the opinion of Lieutenant-Colonel A lies, far too profitable for the Arab dealers to give it up without making every effort to evade the restrictions on it. They were well aware now that both the French and Turkish flags gave immunity from search of British Cruizers and protected the trade and they had learned, moreover, that there were no ditticulties in the way of their obtaining papers at the French settlements and Consulates in the Indian Ocean or Turkish papers at ports in the Red Sea, and it was probable that future importation would be almost entirely confined to vessels sailing under one or other of these flags.32. In December 1879 a party of Hadramis brought three Indian children Political a., june 1879, Nos. 136-149. ^ rorn Hyderabad (Deccan) to Sur in Oman . , c, | , r , and there offered them for sale. A banian ? er u a U t ^ e matter, had the Hadramis detained, and communicat- ed with the Sultan of Maskat. The latter then sent for both Hadramis and c ildren, and at the Political Agent's request put the former into prison and made the two elder children over to the Political Agent, the youngest beinp left in charge of a woman who was then in possession of it. 33. On a report being made to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, he ordered (1) that the Sultan should be thanked and informed that his action would be reported to the Viceroy ; (2) that the proceedings of the banian trader and the nakhoda of the boat who gave him information should be recognised; (3) that the Sultan should be asked to detain the Hadramis (one a Yemen Arab, the other a Cutchi goldsmith) until orders as to their disposal should arrive from India; (4) that the children should be sent to the Commissioner of Police, Bombay. 34. The proceedings of the Resident were approved, but he was told that Seyyid Turki should be left to deal with the Hadramis as he thought fit. . 35' African Coast itself, the source of the Slave Trade, vigorous ope rations were conducted by the British Government; Her Majesty's ship London was specially commissioned for this purpose. A brief account of these operations will be found on Chapter IX and X of Lyne's Zanzibar. The London was removed from the Zanzibar waters in 1883 after having, through her careful watch ing the African coast for ten years, practically put a stop to slave traffic with the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf. (ii) Revival of slave traffic in 1884. Measures taken, 1885-86. 36. In the year 1884 there was a marked increase of the slave traffic from A, ; Political e ., August 1884, Nos. 135 143, Africa to Oman, owing probably to the Gulf Administration Report for .884 85. removal of Her Majesty's ship London from Zanzibar. In May Colonel Miles reported that he had information that attempts would be made to run many cargoes of slaves from the African Coast, and His High- pess Seyyid Turki in June issued a proclamation warning his subjects against transgressing the orders prohibiting this traffic. In October, on information be ing received of the landing of several large cargoes of slaves on the Batineh Coast, His Highness Seyyid Turki issued a fresh proclamation and addressed letters to all the Trucial Chiefs of Oman, asking them to seize all slaves brought by Maskat people to their ports and to punish the importers. 37. In October 1884 the Government Agent at Shargah reported that 54 External a., February 1885, Nos. 9-21. slaves had been landed at Debay, and that External a., March 1885, Nos. 24-38. in spite of his protest the Chief of Debav xtemai a., Apni 1885, Nos. 34-44. countenanced their sale at the place. The Agent was instructed to demand the surrender of all freshly-imported Africans, and a letter was addressed to the Chief of Debay and all the Trucial Chiefs reminding them of their engagement to the British Government, and desiring the surrender of all slaves landed in their districts. Subsequently, Mr. Robertson, First Assistant Resident, proceeded to the Arab Coast in His Majesty's ship Dragoon. The Chief of Debay was made to pay dollars 70 a head for slaves he failed to produce by way of fine. One slave boy was recovered at Shargah, one at Bahrein, and one at Umm-el-Kawain. 38. On the Persian Coast near Lmgah an attempt was made to carry off three Africans residing at Bassidore, but through the exertions of the Gov ernment Agent at Lingah the Chief of Moghoo obtained their release. 39 The Political Agent at Maskat recovered and released one African kid napped from Aden, and four other men, considered to have been imported in recent years, took refuge at the Maskat Consulate. It was thought due to the peculiar circumstances of their case to recommend their release and the indem nification of the alleged owners. C643FD38 AO. Two slavers were captured by Her Majesty 's Philomel, contammg 205 Africans, chiefly women and children. The slave dealers captured were mp soned by His Highness the Sultan. 41. Seyyid Turki was thanked by the Government of India for his friendly action regarding slave traffic. 42. Four fugitive slaves took asylum at the telegraph village subsequently got on board His Majesty Ship Dragoon and were landed at Karachi. 43. There was then a discussion of the measures that should be taken for o„rmression of the slave trade. 1 ne external a., may 1685. nos. 131141. suppression u1 ckwt e*ternai a., march 1886, nos. 257-261. following correspondence on tne suojeci might be read No. 19, dated Bushire, 23rd January 1885. Fro m -L .EOTE ».NT.CouoNEL E. C. Ross, C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and Her Majesty's Consul»General for Fars, . To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge your office letter No. 3 0 53-E., dated 1 ith ultimo, on the subject of prevention of slave traffic during the next season. 2. Before replying I requested Colonel Miles to furnish me with a report on the subject, and I now submit a copy of his letter No. 28, dated 18th January 1885. All experience has shewn that the slave-running traffic between Africa and North ern Arabia can only be effectually checked by action on the African coast. However vigilant Her Majesty's cruizers stationed on the Arabian coast, or in the Persian Gulf, mfv be, thev can only be expected to capture a few out of the total number ot slavers running when that number is large. In my opinion, therefore, the attention of G 0 ^f rn - ment should chiefly be directed to the measures which can be adopted on the A fncan coast. I gather from paragraph 7 of Colonel Miles' report that he consid-rs that the syst 1 of stationing a special vessel as Zanzibar, provided with steam -launches, pr ove ^ a success, and certainly whilst that system was in force the number of slavers reaching Oman grea y diminished. It is to be remembered that besides being more effectual it is also more humane to stop the slavers on the African coast. 4. As regards measures to be adopted within the jurisdiction of this Residency, I would recommend that during the seasons indicated by Colonel Mi es, one vessel-of- war should watch the neighbourhood of Ras-el-Had, keeping, when possible to the southward of that Cape, and a second vessel patrol the Arabian coast from Ras-el-Had to Cape Musendum. If a third vessel wsre available, one would be oest stationed near the entrance of the Persian Gulf, patrolling occasionally along the Batineh coast. C I would in conclusion respectfully draw the attention of Government to the want of some arrangement for disposing of released slaves—a want which is much felt. No. 28, dated Muscat, 18th January 1885. From— Libutenant-Colonel S. B. Miles, Her Britannic Majesty 's Political Agent and Consul, M uscat To—The Political Resident, Persian Gulf, and Her Majesty's Consul-General for Pars. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram dated 31st December 1884, and of your memorandum No. 2, dated 3rd January 1885, forwarding, for any sugges tions I may have to offer, copy of a letter No. 3053-E., dated nth December 1884, from the Assistant Secretary to the Government of India to your address, requesting the sub mission of early proposals regarding the measures to be adopted for the prevention 01 the sea transport of slaves next season, should such be considered necessary by you. 2. i presume that the suggestions called tor are required in reference to the disposition of Her Majesty's cruizers in the Persian Gulf, and I beg respectfully to submit the following remarks as to what appear to me the most advantageous points at which ships can station themselves to intercept slavers on their way up from Zanzibar. 4. The vessels in which the trade in Negro slaves is carried on belong exclusively to Arabs, and, as is well known, they are able to make but one voyage to Africa out and home during the year. Sailing from Arabia as legitimate traders during the prevalence of the north-east trade winds which blow from November to February, they remain at Zanzi bar until the change of the monsoon when, having purchased a cargo of slaves at one of the mainland ports, they begin to turn their bows northward. (39 4. The south-west trade winds set in at Zanzibar in April, and by the end of June most of the Arab dhows have already left the African coast for their own country, either as legitimate traders or slavers. From June to August the monsoon is at the height of its strength, and as Arab craft are fair weather sailers and are not fitted to do battle with the elements in their fury, very few are to be found at sea within this peiiod. In September and October, however, the winds calm down and the dhows then remaining on the African coast make their way up to Arabia. The voyage from Zanzibar to Soor occupies from 16 to 25 days, the distance being nearly 3 ,500 miles. 5. The slave-importing coast of Southern and Eastern Arabia extends from Moculla t^ Basra, a distance of some 2,coo miles. Within this tract the chief slaving ports are in Hadhramant—Moculla, Shehr, and Sihoot; in Oman—El-Ashkhareh. Soor, and the whole Batineh from Burka to Murreyr; and in the Persian Gulf—the so-called pirate coast, the Katr coast and Koweyt. 6. The Persian coast, I believe, receives but few Swahili negroes, the demand in that country being chiefly for Abyssinian concubines and eunuchs imported from Jedda and Hodeida. 7. To watch this long coast line effectively would, it is obvious, require a large fleet of cruizers, and the experiment of Her Majesty's ship London has proved that a single vessel with steam-launches stationed at the point of export—Zanzibar—is a more efficient check on the slave trade than the endeavour to intercept slave dhows at sea. 8. From the evidence of the slaves recovered by Her Majesty's ship Dragoon on the pirate coast and condemned in this Court, it appears that about 300 slaves were successfully landed in the Batineh last season. If we add to this the number captured by Her Majesty's ship Philomel, viz., 205, we have a total of about 500 known to have been shipped. We may safely infer, I think, that this represents but a small portion of the whole number brought to Arabia last year. I attach copy of the slaves' depositions. 9. To intercept slavers bound for Oman and the Gulf the best position for cruizers would, in my opinion, be along a line drawn round Ras-el-Had from Cape Jask. Three cruizers patrolling this line from April to July and again in September and October would probably succeed in cutting off every slaver that came up, but if only two vessels are available for this purpose, I think one should cruise to the north and the other to the southward of Ras-el-Had. No. 2, dated Zanzibar, 3rd March 1885, From— S ir J. K irk, K.C .M.G., Her Majesty's Agent and Consui-General, Zanzibar, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge your No. 49-E. of January 16th, with enclosures, relating to the expressed intention of the people of Ras-el-Khymah to engage in the slave trade. During the past year slaves have been offered on the coast at nominal prices owing to a general famine that has prevailed. The rains last season did not fall in sufficient quantity over a vast extent of the east coast of Africa and the consequence has been death and disease. The trade roads have been impassable from want of provisions for the porters. In some parts whole tribes have migrated in search of food, while near the coast fathers have sold their children or caught and sold neighbours for a few handfuls of grain. Slaves have been offered in numbers on the coast opposite at 6 shillings a head. Under such circumstances, it has been impossible to stop slave running, and large captures have been made. The danger now is that the dealers again accustomed to the traffic will be loath to abandon it, and as a notion has got afloat among the Arabs from the north that we have changed our policv and ceased to oppose the slave trade in consequence of reverses sus tained, as they firmly believe, in the Soudan, I look forward to a determined attempt being made this year to run slaves to the Persian Gulf. Many suspicious vessels have arrived, and His Highness Syud Barghash, with whom I have spoken on the subject, has indicated where he thinks shipments will be attempted. Any information that can be given of the place where slaves have been shipped and the tribes to which they belong will be of much assistance. The famine has been most severe among the Zaramo and Nyka tribes and these have been the slaves chiefly shipped of late. ________ No. 571-E., dated Simla, 18th April 1885. From—G. S.

Dated H. M. S. Osprey at Basra, nth November 1885. From—Commander H. W. Dowdinq, Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, To—C olonel E. C. Ross, C.S .I., Political Resident in Persian Gulf and Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General for Pars. i have the honor to forward herewith a numerical list of all dhows and their cargoes, etc., that have passed Ras-el-Had between the 31st August and 24th October 1885, being the traffic season at the close of the monsoon. It is worthy of remark that only four dhows came over from Africa during this time. On 30th September I visited the Kuriyan Muriyan Islands, finding five men, ten women and children on Hullaniyah Island. The Chief is the same man who visited Bombay in H. M. S. Juno. They still appear to be living a wretched existence amongst the rocks, the children being so sickly that few survive to maturity. I presented them on leaving with a month's food on the part of Her Majesty's Indian Government. It would be of great assistance in future if telegrams from Zanzibar, relating to the departure of slavers, included the name of the dhow and her captain, in order that if successful in landing their slaves at Moculla or other unwatched parts of the coast, a prima facie case for the detention of the dhow might be subsequently established. After two seasons' experience acquired on this coast slave cruizing, I beg to state that in my opinion the most effective method of dealing a blow to the slave trade is by the re-establishment of the' Sultan's power at Sur, which at present remains merely nominal. The moral support of Her Majesty's Government would probably answer all purposes to effect this^ but the neighbouring tribes being now so disintegrated, a repetition of such difficulties as those formerly experienced by Her Majesty's Indian Government in this neighbourhood would appear under any cir cumstances impossible. The strategic situation of Sur as an absolutely necessary resort for slaves, on account of the wind, the sea-going qualities of dhows, fresh water, and the Bedoins' predatory character on the coast, make it, in my opinion, a more important spot to render impracticable for slaves than even Muscat itself. Many seasons pass now with out any interference at this port by Her Majesty's ships, and as no local pressure is brought to bear, the risk of capture remains at present insufficient to deter a continuation of the trade.

Experience has shown that the proper locality for our operations is on the exporting Kast African coast. - . Jr u T , hi ® £ 0int , Was f dmitt€d in *873-74 when Her Majesty^s ship Zontfon was established at Zanzibar, and the great success she had in practically stopping the trade for en years serves as a beacon to indicate the direction our future efforts should take. 11. The difficulty of watching the importing coast, compared with that of watching the exporting coast, may be best understood by measuring the extent of each on the map. 12. The strip of coast in the Sultan of Zanzibar's territories, from whence all the Negroes are exported, to Southern Arabia and the Persian Gulf extends from Ras-Delaado to Mombasa, a distance o some 420 geographical miles. The importing Arabian Coast !h ^ 08u! a ^ Mossendum, a distance of over 1,200 miles, and besides this there is the entire coast of the Persian Gulf. f ,u 3 i u aVe S ^ ed ^ Government my opinion before that it is quite within the power o the bultan of Zanzibar to suppress the trade in his dominions if it pleased him to do so. He is an absolutely despotic ruler, and there is no one to dispute his will. The pure Arabs in his country do not number more than 3,000 or 4,000; the rest of his people are mongrel ^ b A a de g ra d e a race, and the aboriginal Negroes, a large proportion of whom are slaves. With his wealth and the means at his disposal he could have put down the slave trade many years ago, but I believe he was never sincere in his co-operation with us, 14* The position of the Sultan of Oman is totally different. His country contains a numerous warlike and turbulent race accustomed from ages to govern themselves, and over whom he cannot pretend to exercise the same control that his brother does over the sub missive Negroes of East Africa. However much therefore His Highness Sayyid Toorkee might desire it, he has not the means of actively co-operating with us against the slave trade. 15. As regards the utility of telegraphic advices of the movements of slave dhows, it would of course be of great advantage if Her Majesty's representative at Zanzibar could furnish the information suggested by Captain Dowding; but if he can obtain this informa tion I don't know why Sir John Kirk should not make Uae of it himself to intercept the vessels. Of the numerous slavers that are known to have arrived in Arabia in the last two years, not one has been advised from Zanzibar, C643FD42 I do not quite understand the remark of Captain D .wdmg onl &gt;',' 0 ' came from Africa during the time of his cruixe. F.ve or s. X tIm /^ h ' Um o ler , h 0 ^ are known to have reached Oman from ZanzrOar m September and and it follows that either some must have escaped the vigilance of the Osprey an ^ , or that i here has been some misunderstanding in collecting the information owing incompetence of the interpreters. 44 Four of Her Majesty's ships, viz., Reindeer, Woodlark. Kingfisher and „o vt o Sfihinx were then under orders or the External A., lanusry i887&gt; Nos. r r .. j £ rtr'fK Gulf Administration Report for 1886-87. Government of India engaged from 25th April 1886 until 8th June in operations against slavers from the African coast. 4^ About 200 dhows were met with and boarded, but only one vessel was found carrying slaves. This dhow, which had twenty-one slaves onboard, was captured by Her Majesty's ship Woodlark on 16th June. Most of the dhows examined were found to be in ballast, and accounted for this by saying that they had landed their cargoes further south at Socotra, Makallah, etc. This was probably the truth, and it was more than probable that in many instances the cargoes consisted chiefly of slaves. 46. There can be no doubt that large number of slaves were shipped from the coast of Africa during the year, and, by means not fully ascertained, a con siderable number reached the Batineh coast and other parts of Oman. 47. Her Majesty's ships Woodlark and Kingfisher cruised from July to 28th October, when operations ceased. 48. An extensive 'Khor' or creek was discovered by Her Majesty's ship Kingfisher near the village of Sawaih-Beni-bu-Ali. (iii) Anti-Slave Trade Operations, 1888—1891. Decree issued by the Sultan of Zanzibar. Proposal for a similar decree being promulgated by the Sultan of Maskat—nega tived other proposals. 49 From enquiries made by the Resident in 1888, it appeared that a con siderable number of fresh African slaves yearly reached the northern coast of Arabia, both by sea and overland routes. G.lf Administration Report for .889-90. ^ past jggg^ a few A{ricans were liberated from slavery through the exertion of our native agents. Three were brought by sea to Umm-eh Kawain, and being demanded, were handed over to the Residency Agent by the Chief and liberated. 50. At Shargah, a nakhoda attempted to carry two female Africans in slavery to the Persian coast, but the Agent interfered, and eventually both women were sent to Maskat and liberated. 51. In September 1888 information was received that seven fresh African slaves had been imported to Lingah from Sur. Every effort was made to get hold of these persons and have the importer punished, but the action and attitude of the Persian officials completely frustrated all attempts. Curiously enough, the dallal, who imported the slaves, died immediately after the inquiry was instituted, from the sting of a hornet. 53, The Saad-ul-Malk subsequently issued a notification to the effect that External A, March 1890, Nos. 298-299. persons engaging in slave traffic would be punished, and the farmer of the customs was enjoined to bring all cases of importation to the notice of the authorities. 53. In October 1889 the Residency Agent at Bahrein reported that persons, returned from the Mecca pilgrimage, had brought a larger number of slaves than usual, some by sea and some by land. This was brought to the notice of the Chief of Bahrein, who acted loyally and traced 15 slaves, 8 males and 7 females, who had been freshly imported. The Residency Steamer Laivrence was despatched to Bahrein for these Africans, who were manumitted at Bushire. 54. The traffic in raw slaves continued in 1890.91 with unabated vigour, and Gulf Administration Report for 1890-91, numerous importations into the Persian and Arabian ports were reported to have taken43 place. A circular letter was addressed to the Truclal Chiefs, reminding them their engagement in this respect; as usual, the Beni [abr and other Bedouin * External A., December 1890, Nos. 290-312. tribes on the Batinah coast were the , c , . principal offenders.* An attempt to in- t oduce twenty-five slaves into Maskat on a French mail steamer from Aden to arachi was enquired into at Maskat, and six Arabs, shewn to have been implicat ed in the mat er, were imprisoned by the Sultan. In September 1890, twenty- 'Ve African slaves arrived at Maskat in the British India Steam Navigation Com- pany s steamer from Karachi in charge of some Arabs. They were, after inqmry by the Political Agent, liberated with the assent of the Sultan and sent to Bombay. The letter to the Trucial Chiefs referred to above was followed by the discovery and release of several Africans in captivity on the Pirate Coast Two men swam to the steamer Colaer at Lingah and claimed protection as British subjects from Aden ; they also gave information regarding the whereabouts of three other Africans in captivity on the Arab coast. 55* the Persian side the Governor of Bnshire, in response to a request External a ., January 1891, Nos. 27-36. from the Resident, issued orders forbidding , Tr . , • , ,. ' the traffic, which was most brisk at Charak and Kais, the inhabitants of which refused to allow the Deputy Governor of Lingah to make any enquiries. The question of the increasing frequency of the importation of raw slaves into the countries bordering on the Persian Gulf was brought to the notice of Government. Many of the Omani boats were said to fly the French flag and carry French papers, under cover of which they were able to practise their trade in slaves with impunity, and various suggestions for effectually putting a stop to the traffic had been made, which would doubtless receive consideration 57. In 1891 some reports of the importation of fresh slaves into Kishm were Gulf Administration Report for 1891-93. declared by the Governor of Bushire, after enquiry, to be without foundation. 58. Information that several cargoes of slaves had passed up the Shat-el- Extemai a., January 1891, Nos. 158-167. Arab for disposal in the villages along its banks and at Basrah was not confirmed on further enquiry. A dhow with twenty-nine negroes on board was detained at Fao by the Mudir, and they were sent to Basrah. The Wali, however, satisfied himself that they were not slaves, and they were allowed to return to the dhow. 59. In the course of the year the Turkish Consular Agent at Lingah received from his Government a proclamation against slave traffic, issued in accordance with the Slave Trade Treaty between the British and Ottoman Gov ernments for publication amongst Turkish subjects at that port. 60. On the subject of slavery and slave traffic in Turkish Arabia, the following External a ., January i 89i ) Nos. 158-161. letter of Colonel Tweedie to Mr. Stratton, . . Consul at Basrah, No. 710, dated 1st December 1890, is interesting:— 2. 1 wo facts are palpable. Innumerable bouses in Iraki towns—notably Bao -dad— contain male and female Africans (including Gallas) of all ages from childhood upwards who have been bought from slave importers. Bassra, Kuwait, Zubair, are amon? the places near or on the Persian Gulf to which these poor, creatures are taken after being' landed from Africa, i he fact that once bought on Turkish soil they are not sold ao'ain but become members more or less of the first buyer's family, may indeed when old enough walk out of their master's house and assert their independence, without much risk of the authorities openly at least interfering, alleviates their fate undoubtedly; while forming one of the marked differences between slavery in the old European and American and slavery of the Muslim types. Still, the root of the evil—the hideous traffic in humanity—equally resides in both systems. The demand existing in Asiatic Turkey, as in every Islamic country, tells of course on Africa, has its own share, and that a large one, in keeping the kidnappers busy in thousands of African villages. 3. All that they lay within your power has been done.

The question was raised whether a similar decree could not be passed e t . 0 M by the Sultan of Maskat. Secret E., February 1891, Nos, 472-47S. J In an able memorandum Colonel Mockler showed how inexpedient would be the promulgation of a decree of the kind on Oman. The memorandum is an important document throwing a light on the condition of Oman and is therefore printed below. MEMORANDUM. The present Sultan of Zanzibar is sovereign of a ' protected State,' the area of his dominions in round numbers only some 800 square miles, having a population of about 250,000, his annual revenue some ^300,000, his subjects are not divided into separate tribes inhabiting separate districts having Chiefs of their own. He is their one head, and they lie, so to speak, in the hollow of his hand to control. Its small extent and the insular position of his territory makes all parts of it so easily accessible to the i( protecting • He has a standing army of 1,200 men armed State as well as to his Own Soldiers* and with breech-loaders. officials that he can afford to risk or even despise popularity in the matter of issuing decrees in conformity with the wishes of the u pro tecting State,' being pretty certain of support and assistance if necessary from the ' pro tecting power' in giving effect to such decrees. The status and surroundings of the Sultan of Muscat (or Oman) are different. He is but little more than Chief of the Chiefs of Oman, primus inter pares. The area of his dominions (80,000 square miles) 100 times larger than that of Zanzibar, having a population (1,500,000) 6 times greater, but his annual revenue (a large factor in administrative power) ,£30,000 is only one-tenth that of the Sultan of Zanzibar. His nominal subjects are divided into many different tribes continually fighting among themselves, occupying separate tracts of country, whose allegi ance is given in the first place to their own tribal Chiefs. His territory stretches back to the great Arabian Desert and in most part is mountainous and little known to Europeans. His position as Sultan depends on the fickle support of the Chiefs and their tribesmen, which he endeavours to gain and retain principally by judicious presents and payments to them out of the revenue, which, as long as he remains Sultan, it is his pri vilege to collect and disburse. Its principal source (the custom-house at Muscat) being easily defensible, he can when once established retain his hold on it with a comparatively small body of mercenaries obtained by him from such tribes as he thinks he can for the moment best depend on, in face of sometime formidable combinations; but with such a tenure of authority he has but little power to give effect to commands outside Muscat and Mutrah, and to a still more limited extent in the coast towns whose dilapidated forts are garrisoned by small bodies of subsidised tribesmen, and governed in a feeble sort of way by his Walis. For such a Sultan to issue a decree similar to that issued by the Sultan pf 'Zanzibar would be a farce. He would have no power to enforce its provisions outside the environs of Muscat and Mutrah. At present the stipulations of the treaty of 1873 (concluded by Sir Bartle Frere) or solely given effect to by the British Consuls, and necessarily only by him 10 the extent of slaves who manage to escape from their masters in the interior or coast towns, and gain the asylum of the British Consulate. Under that C643FD46 treaty freedom is given by the Consul, after investigation, to fugitives who appear to him to come within its stipulations , to have been brought into the country since 1873) without so far any opposition from the Sultan, but there is no pretence on his part of any further co-operation or of preventing the importation of fresh slaves into the country which continually takes place, even to the extent of giving information regarding such importations t Set entry in Diary, dated 3 „d December .890. f ither 0 , r bef 1 0 . re the ev( : nt ™ hich he doubt - less could do, but his sympathies* are with the slave runners, and with those who want to buy slaves. In all cases of slave running or slave dealing by his subjects he and they also abide, perforce by the decision of the British Consul when such cases come actually into his hands and power to decide. If their slaves escape to the Consulate or their slave dhows are towed into Muscat by a British cruiser they do not care for the small percentage of such losses to try conclusions with the British power. Being caught by a British cruiser, and the occasional escape of a few slaves to the British Consulate, is the only risk the slave runners or slave buyers have to face. No one will prevent them landing their slaves, or selling them if they have escaped the cruiser?, not openly in a public mart, but quietly and without difficulty. In these circum stances it would serve no useful purpose or the cause of humanity for the present Sultan to issue a decree touching the status of slaves &lt;l lawfully possessed' (under existing treaties), limiting to heirs in the first degree the right of inheriting such and giving all slaves throughout the country, the right of self-emption, when there are now thousands of slaves in the country who are ' unlawfully possessed ' (according to treaty engagements) whose number is annually recruited by fresh importations, whom the Sultan of Muscat or the British Government cannot, under the existing regime, give freedom to, and whose possessois are mostly beyond the reach of either to question or compel. Were His Highness Seyyed Feysal to issue such a decree, its stipulations could not be enforced by him, but it would probably have the effect of raising against him a storm of anger and intrigue throughout the country which might cost him his position as Sultan of Muscat, and deprive him of a home and comfortable circumstances for himself, family, brother, and other rela- tions. The tribesmen, whom he would have to call to his assistance, would probably turn against him and open the gates to a rival aspirant. He has for the present declined to issue a decree similar to that of the Sultan of Zanzibar. For effect to be given in Oman to such a decree or even to a full extent to the slave treaties already concluded with Muscat Government must wait for the appearance of a Sultan of a type different from that ot late Sultans of Muscat or proclaim a protectorate over Oman, which would, I think necessitate an armed demonstration through the country, or annex and govern it as a British possession. Such a decree, it appears to me, should in logical sequence come after the im portation of fresh raw slaves into the country has ceased and been made impossible or at least very rare, and in the case of Zanzibar that postulate may, I suppose, be accepted as an accomplished fact ; the decree is therefore a natural and fitting corollary to former treaties with Zanzibar made patent and binding at an opportune moment, its provisions are feasible of being enforced there without danger to the Sultan who issued it, or necessitating any very extraordinary measures on the part of the British Government. In the case of Oman the first postu ate must be denied, and all other conditions and circumstances are un- fortanatHy q u, te different from those at Zanzibar. The provisions of snch a decree oannot and e h C e ^ raordin , ar y measures on (he part of the British Government, and its mere bairen promulgation would be dangerous to the Sultan, and unfair to press on him without a guarantee of protection against the consequences.

ChiefS) by taking active steps f or t he suppression of slavery in his dominions. 5. We therefore concur with Colonel Ross that some inducement would have to be held out to the Sultan if it were decided to press him to undertake measures for abolishing slavery within Oman^ and we are of opinion that the only form in which such an induce ment could, at the present time, be offered is that of an assurance of support in the event of his position being endangered by compliance with any demands of the British Govern ment relating to slavery. We think that such an assurance had better be avoided, and in any case we could not, In view of the instructions contained in Lord Kimberley's Des patch No. 25 (Political), dated the 31st March 1886, take such action without previously referring to Your Lordship. 65. The Secretary of State concurred in the views of the Government of 0 India (despatch No. 13-Secret, dated the Secret E., luly l8 9 t, Nos. 99-100. jjth Aprii ,89-). 66. In a demi-official letter, dated 21st February 1891, Colonel Mockler „ T , 0 XT suggested that one of the most fea- ecret juyigi, os. 390 394. sible and effectual steps that could be taken to put an end to the importation of slaves from the African coast into Oman would, in conjunction with a return to the 'slave cruising ' by a sufficient number of gun-boats, be for Government to issue an order or proclamation forbidding for (say) two years any Omani boats (badans and zeimahs) from proceeding to Zanzibar or the East Africa Coasts under the penalty of being summarily des troyed if caught beyond a certain distance from the Oman coasts by our cruisers, whether slaves or not. He also suggested a system of license signed by the Sultan and countersigned by the Political Agent being given to larger vessels for carrying passengers to Africa. 67. The Government of India thought that the probable result of adopting these suggestions would be to put an end to legitimate as well as illegitimate com merce, and that so stringent a measure for merely checking abuses in the passen ger traffic carried on by the Oman boats, would, on the one hand, be unneces sary, and, on the other, difficult, if not impossible, to enforce. The further diffi culty was Whether if Her Majesty's ships proceeded in the manner proposed their action, if challenged, could be supported by law (despatch to the Secretary of State, No. 97-Secret—External, dated 16th June 1891.) (iv) Importatioa of slaves on the Arab and Batineh Coasts, 1892-94. 68. There was discovered a good deal of activity in slave trade on the Batineh and the Pirate coasts in 1892, and Secret e., March 1893. os. 3 -27. j n November of that year, Colonel Talbot visited the latter coast in the Sphinx^ the Cossack and Lawrence accompany ing (1) At Khor Fakan. —One Salim-ul-Badi, a dealer on slaves, was reported to have brought 33 slaves from Zanzibar on a Suri boat to Ras-ul- Khima, and to have then taken them to Khor Fakan, where they were disposed of. The Resident inflicted on the Chief of Ras-ul-Khima the usual fine of 70 dollars for each of the slaves imported with some reduction, as the main responsibility rested on the slave dealer and the Sheikh of Khor Fakan (a cousin and feudatory of the Chief of Ras -ul- Khima). At Himriyeh. —At this place five slaves had been lately landed, and the Chief of Shargah was made to recover 350 dollars from the princi* pal men of Hemriyeh, whose Chief had absconded.48 At Debai. —Two slaves had been imported at this place by a Bahrein sub ject and a demand of the Shargah Agent for their surrender was refused. A fine of 2^0 dollars was exacted from the officials of the Chief of Shargah in the latter's absence, 4 69. It is interesting to note that one of the dhows of Salim-ul-Badi at Ras- ul-Khima was obserred to be flying a French flag and he was spoken of as a French subject. Lieutenant-Colonel Talbot was of opinion that the discontinu ance of the grant of French colours at Obokand elsewhere would perhaps be more effectual than systematic cruising in putting a stop to slave trade. 70. The Resident also drew attention of the Officiating Political Agent at Secret e ., March ,893, Nos. ,75.179. Maskat to the increase of the slave trade, . more particularly on the Batineh coast. Un reminding the Sultan of his treaty obligation, he professed to discredit the rumours, and the only action he could be induced to take was to issue a pro clamation re-iterating the purport of the Slave Trade Treaty of 1873. 71. In December 1894 the Resident reported two cases of Slave Trade on Secret e., April 1895, Nos. 5.17. ^ le Arab coast. In one of them five ... . . , slaves were taken to Ras-ul-Khima by a Maskat subject, named AbdulIa-bin-Salman of Khadreh, who having failed to dispose of them, subsequently carried them away. In the other case one slave was imported by a native of Sur and sold to one Jasim-bin-Yakub, a subject of Ras-ul-Khima. This slave died soon after being sold. 1 • T: Th fu G % ern r m ^ of I ? dia . ordered that a fine of 70 dollars should be levied from the Chief of Ras^el-Khima for the one slave sold in his territory in the second case, and that m the first case the displeasure of Government at his disregard of his treaty obligations should be marked by inflicting on him a fine of ao dollars for each of the five slaves. So a total sum of Rs. 195 was ordered aSth 6 February 1895). ( Forei g n Department letter No. 437.E., dated 73.

In May 1896, Captain Beville, Political Agent at Maskat, in the absence Gulf Administration Report for 1896-97. ^ an_V war vessel, personally effected the eapture of an Arab dhow with 28 slaves on board (see paragraphs 173-76 below). Captures were also made by the Lapwing and Sphinx ; the two vessels seized by the latter being under French colours, the regularity and validity of which seemed open to doubt, were made over to the French Vice-Consul. 79. Several minor slave transactions of a local and unimportant character came to light. In one of these a small party of Baluch slaves, for the most part boys, who had probably been kidnapped, were shipped at Wadam on the Batineh coast—a place of evil repute in this connection—for Lingah. An adult of the party there made his escape, and the remainder were carried to Debay, where two more after escaping fell into the hands of the Arabs of Khan, a dependency of Shargah. These were recovered and sent to Maskat, where on the clue furnished by Feroz's evidence proceedings were taken resulting in the conviction of a large number of slave-dealers. An attempt at re-enslavement of a liberated slave on the Persian coast was reported he was recovered after some months at, Lingah, and handed over to the Commander of H. M. S. Sphinx. 80. Six slaves who, after effecting their escape from Shargah, had managed to reach the telegraph station at Jask, were brought to Bushire, and being there liberated were conveyed to Maskat at their own desire. 81. A more serious case was the kidnapping of 17 men on the South Arabian coast by an armed party of the Yal Saad, who carried them by boat to the Batineh coast and thence sent them by land to the Pirate coast or the interior. This act was committed in February 1896, but the facts did not come to light till the beginning of the year 1897, on the information of one of the slaves who had escaped. The Shaikh of the Yal Saad who was directly implicated was imprisoned by the Sultan, and later died in confinement. Only one other of the party was traced in the possession of the Bedouin, and as it was impossible to obtain his freedom without ransom, the disbursement of the sum required was sanctioned by Government. 8 .

Runaway Slaves at Gwadur and claims of the Rinds of Mand for their restoration. Disturbances created by the Rinds. 84. One great source of disturbance on the Mekran coast has been the raids and roDbenes of the unruly tribe of the Rinds of Mand. which have mainly been ue to the action taken in liberating their slaves escaping to Gwadur. We shall trace here the history of the Rind troubles though in doing this we have to touch on other incidental matters, which have little to do with slave question, but which being inseparably intermixed with it, cannot be left aside. 85. The Slave Trade Treaty signed in 1873 by the Sultan of Maskat provides— free ' ^ ^ perSOnS hereafter entering the Sultan's dominions and dependencies shall be ' The Sultan engages to protect to the utmost of his power all liberated slaves and to punish severely any attempt to molest them or reduce them again into slavery.' 86. The treaty applied to Gwadur, a port belonging to the Sultan of Maskat on the coast of Mekran. The difficulty of enforcing the treaty here arose not so much from the importation of African slaves from over the coast, but from the fugi tive slaves from Baluchistan taking refuge at Gwadur: slavery had taken deep roots in Baluchistan, both British and Persian. The treaty of 1873 prohibits natives of Indian States under British protection from possessing and acquiring fresh slaves. The principal order issued to give effect to this engagement in respect of the Kelat state and Baluchi tribes subordinate to the Khan of Khelat, is Her •Hertsiet's Treaties, Volume XIV, page 1005. Majesty's Order in Council, dated 30th Apnal 1877,* applying, among other places, to Khalat the Slave Trade Act of 187b (providing for punishment of offences under sections 3^7j 37° an&lt; ^ 37 ^ Indian Penal Code, committed by subjects of Her Majesty or Indian States under British protection upon the high seas or on any part of Asia or Africa as may be specified in an Order in Council). 86. But neither this order nor any other seems to have been enforced in such a way as to check the possession or acquisition of slaves by the Rinds of Mand and other Baluchi tribes in subordination to the Khan of Khelat, who almost surround Gwadur. On the other hand, correspondence from 1875 to 1884 contains several references to slavery in a modified form as being a recognized institution amongst the Rinds and other Baluchi tribes of Mekran (Mr. J. A. Crawford to the External a., January 1894, Nos. 312-337. F orei g' Department, No. 171, dated 18th September 1893). 87. The Sultan loyally enforced the treaty of 1873 at Gwadur. In 1876 one Wad Mahomed, a Rind, lost three slaves, who escaped'to Gwadur. Wad Mahomed demanded his slaves, and when they were refused he cut the telegraph wire, burnt the guard-houses, and went off vowing vengeance. The naib of Nedj was appealed to in vain to punish the Khan's subjects, Wad Mahomed, and the telegraph subsidy was thereupon stopped. Outrages upon British traders, Gwadur subjects, and on telegraph property or persons were periodically reported. But in July 1879 occurred the great case which is generally called the blood-feud case. 88. The facts were as follows, as collected from the statement of the Rinds made before Sir Robert on February 23rd, 1884, an d from the evidence of Sakina and other sources. Sakina, a Khoja woman, and a British subject, resident of Gwadur, was in the middle of 1879 returning from the Baho district to Gwadur. Her party was joined by a party of Bumpuris ; when near Taleri a party of Rinds fell on them and robbed Sakina of some bracelets which she was taking for the wife of the Governor of Geh and of other property worth in all Rs. 528-14; and also compelled her to pay Rs. 25 for her release. Three days after this occurrence [C643FD]54 another party of Rinds carried off some cattle from near Gwadur The Wali, then a young man and with no political officer on the spot to advise him, determined to retaliate. A party of Rinds accompanying a kafila of Shahbaz Kabu-Abi of the Kanaki clan two days later accompanied a party of Hindu traders of Mand to Gwadur, and the Wali sent for some of the party to enquire about the recent raids. Presently they half drew their swords and ranaway. The Wali with nine Arabs followed and pursued the party to the seashore. Two shots were fired by the Rinds, one of which struck the bank under the Wali who fell. The Wali gave the order to attack, and one Rind was killed by a bullet, a second by a sword cut, and a third died of his wounds. Two ran away and five were made prisoners and afterwards released. Such was the origin of the blood claim which the Rinds brought against the people of Gwadur, alleging that the Rinds who were murdered belonged to a different class from the Rinds who raided. 89. The Rinds also had three other small claims according to Major Mock- ler's report against the people of Gwadur. In schedule B of His report Colonel Sandeman makes however a total of eight claims which include the robbery of some 13 camels, two guns, and two swords, as well as the murder of Morad, son of Dilwash, and the wounding of another. On the other side of the account, Colonel Ross summarised the claims of British and Gwadur subjects against the Rinds as follows :—(1) seventeen outrages against telegraph employes and pro perty ; (a) robberies on British subjects at Gwadur, 14 cases with a loss of Rs. 2,460 worth of property ; (3) robberies on Maskat subjects, 90 cases involv ing losses estimated at Rs. 12,460. These unavenged cases extend from 1876 to 1883. The blood-feud case to which attention has been called above occurred in June 1879. There were therefore involved in the Rind dispute, which Sir Robert was sent to settle, difficulties arising from the slave treaty, attacks upon the British telegraph line, outrages upon British subjects, and losses inflicted on Gwadur subjects of Maskat. The Rinds wished to avenge the loss of three men killed under the Wali's sanction and a few thefts or robberies committed on them. 90. In July 1883 Sir Robert Sandeman was ordered to enquire into and, External A., December ,884, No.. .97-393. ? S ^ f P 08 ?; 1 ? 16 ! Settle the q^Stion pend- mg with the Rinds. 91. Sir Robert Sandeman reported on the subject in his letter No. 942, dated the a5th March 1884. He did not camp at Mand, but was met by the Rind headmen at Tump, and passed by one of the Mand villages on his way to Gwadur. Certain cases were taken up in a jirga assembled by him at Tump, and others were left pending, for reasons which are not now material. In an agree ment of the 4th February 1884, the Rind headmen promised to be responsible for the good conduct of their respective sections, that injury should not be done by their tribesmen to the telegraph line, or Government servants, or British subjects, and to produce perpetrators of such outrages for punish ment by the British Government and to arrest, if possible, disaffected or refractory members of the tribe. The Gichki Sardar of Kej and His Highness the Khan's naib there undertook by the same agreement to look after the Rind headmen, to assist them in making arrests, and to prevent outrages in future. Under the circumstances Sir Robert Sandeman deprecated severe measures against the Rinds. 1 he record against them, he observed, was not very for midable. A heavy fine, if imposed, would have to be collected by force; and on the whole he advised ' giving them a trial, treating them leniently this time, • Foreign Secrelary to Agent to the Governor. an ^ Watching their behaviour in future ' p®'®'?' No f ^ i88 4- The reply * of the Government of India [This is not on record jn the Political Agent's u • i it office.] 6 having expressed some doubt as to the SelX' N 0 „, of the agreement made by the Rind , , . , . headmen, Sir Robert Sandeman submitted the tollowing explanation! 'The document in question was executed by the Mukkadams of every section of the Mand Rinds, by Sardar Bhai Khan. Gichki, and by the Khan's Naib of Kej. It was moreover, witnessed by the Chiefs of every tribe of the Brahui confederacy, including the SarHar next highest in rank in the Kalat State to the Khan of Kalat himself, and conBnned by the Khan s Vakil. I would therefore record that all my experience in dealing with55 Btljch tribes leads me to believe emphatically that an agreement of this nature is not likely to be lightly disregarded; any breach of it should, beyond doubt, be severely dealt with/' tv ? 2 ' u By o r o der 0f the Government of Jndia a Court of Enquiry met at Gwadur m March 1885 to further investigate the Rind cases. They fell into three groups telegraph cases, (^) claims by Maskat and British subjects at kwadur against the Rinds, and (c) counter-claims for blood-money preferred by the Rinds against the Maskat administration of Gwadur. As to the first * Foreign Secretary to Agent to the Governor. group there Was no dlfficultV ; and the G.ne'a', No. M2S.E., dated the .sth Sep, em be. , 8»5. counter-claims in the third were dis- allowed by the Governor General in Council. In regard to the remaining cases it was found that the Rinds had ' committed during the past twelve years five raids on a large scale,' and also ' numerous smaller cases of cattle- lifting, besides highway robberies.' The upshot was that a sum of Rs. 7,010 was decreed against the Rinds, and in favour of Maskat and British subjects on account of cases of the second group. With reference to the execution of t ibid, paragraph io. thls ^ ecree . an d to the expediency of not treating the Rinds severely, the decision t of the Governor General in Council was as follows 'The blood-feud claim has been rejected, and therefore all considerations relative to that claim are inadmissible. Nor are the Government disposed to accept the pleas which turn upon the hereditary antagonism of the Baluch of Mekran and Gwadur Govern ment, the temptations to which the Rinds are exposed, poverty and disunited char- acter of the tribe, the importance of their friendship, or the possibility of harsh mea sures compelling them to seek refuge in Persia. On the other hand, the Governor General in Council is willing to attach weight to the following circumstances:—(1) the improved behaviour of the tribe since 1883 ; {2) the fact that the peace of the country is probably secured for the present; and (3) the consideration that, on the whole, now that the Rinds have submitted, a policy of leniency seems best calculated to insure a permanent settlement for the future. While, therefore, holding that the Rinds might justly be called up to pay the fines awarded, and coerced in the event of refusal, the Government of India are prepared to revert to the original proposal expiained in the Foreign Department letter of the 24th December last. By the adoption of this course, the Governor General in Coun cil does not apprehend any detriment to the interests of peace and security. Accordingly, while the whole amount (Rs. 7,010) awarded against the Rinds will be held to be formallv decreed, the tribe will be relieved from the immediate payment of the fines, con ditionally upon the execution by the Rind c hiefs and Mukkadams of a bond or en gagement for their good behaviour and for the payment of the whole sum decreed within five years ; the bond to be enforced only in the event of further aggressions or future mis conduct on the part of the tribe. In accordance with this arrangement, the funds necessary for the due execution of the Gwadur awards will now be provisionally advanced by the British Government and distributed among the claimants.' 93. In pursuance of this decision Colonel Reynolds { went to Gwadur j Colonel Reynolds to Agent to the Governor in February 1 886, distributed the amount General, No. 331,dated 7th April 1886. decreed to the claimants, and obtained from the Rinds the bond quoted below, which was executed in his presence :— Whereas the Government of India have been pleased to direct that the sum of Rs. 7 ,o to awarded against the Rind tribe in Mekran by a Court assembled at Gwadur in the month of March 1885 be held to be formally decreed, but that the tribe be relieved from the immediate payment of this sum conditionally upon the execution by the Rind Chiefs and Mukkadams of a bond or engagement for theu- good bahaviour of the future, and for the payment of the whole sum decreed within five years ; and further that this bond be enforced only in the event of further aggression? or further misconduct on the part of the tribe, we, the headmen of the Rind tribe, do hereby agree to abide by the conditions above stated, and to be responsible each and every one of us for the good behaviour of our respec tive sections, that none of our tribesmen shall hereafter damage the telegraph line or injure any Government servant, and that travellers and traders passing through or sojourn ing in our country shall not be molested, and that none of our people shall commit any act likely to disturb the peace of the country. We a ! so hereby agree to make ourselves res ponsible for the payment to Government- within five years of the above-mentioned sum of Rs. 7,010.' 94. Colonel Reynolds at the same time submitted § two proposals for the future management of the Rinds of § Colonel Reynolds to Agent to the Governor ]VI an d namely (^) that dealings with General, No. 331, dated the 9th April 1886. u U u • J .l l n? 1- them should be earned on through Wall Mahammad, Ghazkandi, who was nominated in his presence by their headmen to be their representative Sardar, and (^) that some subsidy should be paid to56 the tribe. Sir Oliver St. John |1 agreed in the first pro posal, but doubted the II Agent to the Governor to Foreign Secretary, expediency of the second, a.nd considered No &gt; 2619, dated the nth June 1886. that if any payment were made, it should be allotted to Wali Mahammad, Gazkandi, and be deducted from the subsidy received by His Highness the Khan's Naib at Kej. ' For my own part,' added Sir Oliver St. John, ' I believe that we shall have a sufficient hold over the Rinds in the bond they have executed for the refund of the loan made to them to pay for their misdeeds, which is not likely to be repaid unless we present them with money for the purpose.' The Government was disposed* to accept Sir Oliver * Foreign Secretary to Agent to the Governor St. Johns VlCWS, but thought it desirable General, No. 1499- e ., dated the8th July 1886. to ascertain the wishes of the Khan of Kalat before coming to a final conclusion. It was found that the Khan did not regard either of Colonel Reynold's proposals with favour. ' His Highness said,' Sir Oliver St. John reported, f ' that to give them money wouM be like throwing t Agent to the Governor General to Foregin Sec- it IlltO the Sea, and that their turbulent retary, No. 544- f . c., dated the 15th August 1886. an( j independent character is such that they will never allow any single man the smallest real authority. Had the arrangement which he initiated for the Government of Kej, viz., sending his eldest son there as Governor, been approved of, it would have been easy enough to manage the Rinds, but since we preferred to continue the old regime, loss of revenue to himself and the continued misconduct of the Rinds must be taken as a matter of course.' Sir Oliver St. John thought it clear that nothing could be done through the Khan, and he suggested that the Naib of Kej might be warned that his subsidy would depend upon his controlling the Rinds of Mand. The Government of India did not pass orders on the subject for some months. At the end of the year 1886 a raid occurred at Firozabad in Persian territory, and certain Rinds were concerned m it. Enquiry showed,! however, that they were J Foreign Secretary to Agent to the Governor Rinds of Wakai, not of Mand. In the General. No. 685.E., dated the 23rd March 1887. spring 0 f , ggy the Foreign Secretary visit ed Baluchistan and discussed the case of the Mand Rind with Colonel Reynolds and Sir Oliver St. John. Doubts seem§ to have been felt at this time as to whether i Foreign Secretary to Agent to the Qoverncr tribe should be dealt with in future as General NO. sS-c.E., dated the 8th April 1887. wholly independent or through the Naih ^ 1 Fore.gn Secretary to Agent to the Governor r t /• uuuugil me naiD Genera, No. ios 6. e ., dated the 21st May 1887, 0l: *^ e J as primarily responsible for their r . good conduct. Eventually the Governor ueneral in Council sanctioned f the following arrangements, which were in accordance with Sir Oliver St. John's final recommendation :— ' ( a ) The Rinds of Mand will be considered to be Kalat subj'ects. (3) No subsidy will be paid to them by the Government. (c) The Khan's Naib of Kej will be held primarily responsible for their conduct. (d) If the Naib fails to keep them in order, or. If for other reasons inter ference seems necessary, they will be directly dealt with by the Political Agent in South-Eastern Baluchistan. (e) Mir Wali Muhammad, Gazkandi, is recognised by the Government of India as their tribal Chief.' „ . gs- J! 16 ® 6 orders were communicated by Sir Oliver St. John to the Khan, and His Highness replied as follows in a letter of the 13th June 1887 : Kei count™ r ;' | Shahadad , Kh ' n ' my Naib of Ke j- He wil1 report the details of the Kej country.

If desir a ble .

The Director did not anticipate any serious trouble from the Rinds ; and nothing more seems to have been heard of the letter. 99. In May 1893 the Political Agent at Maskat (Major Sadler) reported that a party of Rinds had arrived at Gwadur in order to regain possession of their absconded slaves, that the \\ ali of Gwadur had applied to the Sultan for help, and that His Highness had sent the Wali of Mattrah (near Maskat) to Gwadur with 20 men. The Political Agent observed that the presence of the slaves at Gwadur was a source of anxiety, and that it would be a good thing to have them removed. The Wali of Mattrah telegraphed to the Resident at Bushire, proposing that the Rind Chiefs should be invited to Maskat to arrange matters; but Colonel Talbot replied through the Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs disapproving of this, as negotiation could only have for its object the surrender of the slaves which would be contrary to the orders of Government. The Wali of Mattrah soon after left Gwadur ; and the Wali of Gwadur reported that he had enough troops. Colonel Talbot also requested the Director to communicate with the Political Agent in Southern Baluchistan, and Mr. Posiman did so in his letter No. 172 -P., dated the 13th May 1893! extracts from which are quoted below - *'This matter has been already brought to your notice, vide my letter No 580P. dated 30th November 1892; and it appears that the influx into Gvvadur of escaped slaves is still continuing. If this matter is not now settled in some way, I shall not be surprised if the Rinds were to damage the telegraph line, as they of course know that the Wali of Gwadur would return their slaves, if it were not for the orders of Government to the contrary. ' I cannot myself see how any settlement can be arrived at without giving com pensation for the escaped slaves to which the Rinds doubtless consider hemselves fully entitled. In the event of the present negotiations proving a failure, I have no doubt the Rinds will try and recoup themselves for their losses by robbing kafilas, unless you exert your influence with their chiefs and induce them to keep quiet.' 99A. The Political Agent (Lieutenant Cubitt) replied, in his No. 434 of the 28th June 1893, as follows :— 'In reply I have the honour to inform you that I am referring the matter for the orders of the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. ' The Rind Sardar of Mand was addressed by my predecessor to the effect that he would be held strictly responsible for any disturbances.' 99B. At the end of July 1852 Dr. Jayakar forwarded to the Resident two letters received from the Sultan, which had been addressed, apparently in July, by Nur Muhammad J the Rind, to the Wali of Gwadur, and to the Sultan himself. The [C643FD]58 letter to the Sultan invited him to meet the Rinds at Gwadur, and settle the question of the si ves and murders, and in default ol such settlement threatened attack Gwadur, and observed that the British Government, which had for bidden the restoration of slaves, had retired from the country. Copies of these letters were sent to the Political Agent for Southern Baluchistan, having previously telegraphed the substance of their contents. At the same time the Sultan was informed that there had been no recent sign of aggressiveness on the part of the Rinds, and that the case had been referred to the Baluchistan Agency. 100. Dr. Jayakar, on the authority of the Wali of Gwadur, gave 179 (70 males, 74 females, and 35 children) as the total number of slaves in Gwadur belonging to the Rinds. These slaves were said to be ' earning their livelihood in Gwadur either as labourers or porters,' to be under protection, and to be unwilling to leave Gwadur for Karachi. The Sultan of Maskat having expressed anxiety for the settlement of this case, Dr. Jayakar was asked what His Highness 0 Letter No, 25a, dated the 20th August 1893. meant by a settlement. In reply to this Dr. Jayakar wrote* as follows :— settlement which His Highness the Sultan desires is that the Rinds mav be effectually prevented from assuming a threatening attitude towards Gwadur ard from annoying any of his subjects there, as it is feared that the Rinds are sure sooner or 1?^ to resent the action of the Wali in giving refuge and protection to their slaves. o- V 1 a -n of , 0 P in10 ' that th f presence of such a large number of slaves beloneinff to the Rinds will always be an element of danger at Gwadur, and that the best cou.se under the circumstances would be their removal to British territory, as suggested by you in native boats, which His Highness the Sultan also considers as quite feasible.' The Native Assistant gave 198 (men, women and children) as the number of slaves m Gwadur belonging, more or less jointly, to the Rinds of Mand and the people of Dasht, besides 5° ^gm^s from Kolaneh, and from Bahoo and Murtan m Persian termory. He stated that the slaves were under protectfon but that the Rinds were still writing to the Wali to claim them, and that the slaves professed readiness to go to Karachi, or Maskat. or elsewhere if thev could be protected at Gwadur. ^wucrc, 11 they 101.

Baluchi Slaves from Mekran to the Arab Coast. 105. We have treated in the last chapter about the troubles we had to face on account of the runaway slaves from the Rinds of Mand at Gwadur. The correspondence on that subject shows how deep rooted was slavery among the Baluchi tribes. Our attention has recently been drawn to the affair from another direction. 106. In 1896 a gang of Baluchis and the Shaikh of Wadam, who had Secret e, March ,897, No S . 136..39. for many years been engaged in the import and sale of slaves of Mekrani Baiuchis at Wudam on the Batineh coast, were brought to book. Wudam on the Batineh was, in regard to Mekrani slaves, what Sur was in regard to Africans. 107. The Sultan had for long evaded his obligations in regard to the arrest of these slave dealers, and it was only after much pressure had been brought to bear upon him by Lieutenant Beville that the Sultan was induced to order the arrest of seven of the accused including the Shaikh of Wudam. 108. These persons, with the exception of the Shaikh, who was found too ill to attend the Court, were tried by Lieutenant Beville and Seyyid Bedr bin Self, and all, with one exception, were found guilty of slave dealing, their finding was accepted as correct by the Sultan and the Baluchis were Imprisoned and lined 100 to 500 dollars each. 109. Colonel Wilson hoped that the punishment of these offenders would have a deterrent effect on slave trade in the locality. no.

As regards the suggestion for enforcing strict compliance with Article V Ibid, Nos. 3 and 12. of . the General Treaty of 1820 by the Trucial Chiefs, Major Cox reported on 18th June 1904 that the provision was more or less a deadletter, and as it was found that the native craft of the pirate coast have not been recently great offenders against the general spirit of the treaty, there was little to be gained by exacting punctilious adherence to the details of the treaty, which could with difficulty be enforced upon the seagoing public by the chiefs. The Government of India, while admitting the force of these arguments, wished Major Cox to draw the attention of the chiefs to their obligations under article V of the Treaty and press for a stricter adherence thereto (No. 2407, dated 29th July 1904). Mfc.—The preamble of the Brussels Act, however, refers only to African sluvery. C643FD62 CHAPTER VII. Reception of fugitive slaves on board Her Majesty's ships of war and other British vessels. 117. This question has formed the subject of considerable correspondence in our records, and one of the first cases was Political A., January 1874, Nos. 98-107. ^ by ^ M3 j esty ' s ship Magpie. Then there was the case of Hugh Rose. Both these cases were referred to in the discussion that took place in the third case in which the May Frere gave protection to a slave, and we proposed to review the correspond ence in the two previous cases in connection with the last. 118. On the night of the 31st August 1873, as the May Frere was lying at anchor near the uninhabited island of Zairkoo, a slave, named Joah, swam off from one of the 73 pearl-fishing boats lying near and claimed protection. Major Grant, the First Assistant Political Resident, happened to be on the vessel and gave his opinion that the man, having once been admitted on board, was entitled to the protection he claimed. On learning this all the pearl boats weig'hed from their anchorage in fear as we had discovered there were slaves on board them : thereupon the Commander of the May Frere weighed to enable the pearl boats to return to their fishing. In reporting the case Commander Guthrie remarked that the maritime truce had been so effectual that no ship had been sent specially to the pearl banks for years— 'but should the Trucial Chiefs fear a breach among themselves, and require the presence of a ship of war, it would be rather awkward if the cruisers found out that one-third of the boat's crews were slaves, and if he seized them on account of the head money he would be entitled to for them, quoting as precedent May Frere carried a slave away from the pearl banks and he was not given up.' 119. Major Grant stated that his opinion was founded, not on any definite instruction he had received, but on the precedent established by Colonel Pelly in the case of three slaves who swam from shore to the Hugh Rose on or about the 15th August 1872, on which occasion Colonel Pelly instructed the commanding officer not to give up the slaves, although their restoration was demanded by their masters and the ship was lying in a Persian port: the slaves were taken to Major Grant at Bahrein, who, under instructions from Colonel Pelly, sent them to the Commissioner of Police in Bombay. 120. Major Grant suggested that in the present state of the slave-trade question, it would be satisfactory to have some definite instructions from Govern ment as tp what class of slaves are entitled to receive protection on board British ships, as in both the cases mentioned the slaves who received protection seemed undoubtedly to come under the head of domestic slaves, and if domestic slaves were allowed to receive protection on board every English ship the owners would be great losers and the pearl fishing would come to a standstill as nearly all the divers belonged to that class. ^21. Colonel Ross thought Major Grant was right not to surrender the slave, and told him so, adding that commanders of Government vessels should be so far as possible dissuaded from receiving domestic slaves on board their vessels. 122. Colonel Ross referred to the correspondence of 1871, in July of which year Colonel Pelly sought instructions ^ from the Bombay Government for his guidance m such cases. On that occasion two slaves had introduced themselves on board the Magpie when at anchor in the inner roads of Bushire, and Colonel Pelly received two letters of reclamation, one from the Persian Slave Commis- sioner and the other from a British protected subject at Bushire. As one slave appeared to be the property of a Persian subject, and Colonel Pelly considered ' The importation of slaves by sea alone is for- that Under the terms of the document and^rene wed ''u n d^r^'Artie l^ 0 XIU^o/^ ^reat of n0ted ^ Were precluded by Paris, signed 4th March 1857. positive agreement from interfering directly Persians found within the territorial waters of Persia, he transferred thTTlave to63 the Persian Slave Commissioner: but he also requested the slave agent to consider the slave as under his own surveillance and charge pending confirmation of proceedings. 123, The other slave, reclaimed by the British protected subject, appeared on enquiry to be the property of the claimant's sister, and Colonel Pelly declined to interfere on her account at the request of a British protected subject: the slave not having been reclaimed by the Slave Commissioner was set at liberty by Colonel Pelly. Soon after other slaves came alongside the Bullfinch ) but the Commander declined to receive them on board. 1 24. Colonel Pelly thereupon solicited instructions providing for the contin gency of slaves seeking refuge on Her Majesty's ships of war. He wrote:— ' I presume that, as a general rule, a slave boarding one of Her Majesty's vessels with out the limit of territorial waters [i.e., beyond a sea league from the shore line, and without the line of the King's chambers) could come under the law of the ship and before (sic,) Would! the fact of the Persian Gulf being a narrow sea, almost wholly landlocked, give a riparian power, territorial or other jurisdiction thereon beyond the distance of a sea league from the shore line, or should the gulf beyond the distance of a sea league from the shore line be considered as the high sea ? 'Apart from the provisions of any positive law or treaty engagement in the case would a British vessel of war be authorized in refusing to surrender a slave who might have found refuge on board such vessel of war, being at the time of the refugees boarding her within the territorial waters of the power reclaiming the slave ? 125. The Bombay Government In reply furnished Colonel Pelly with the opinion of their law officers, viz.:— ' The Commander of a British ship of war is not bound to receive fugitive slaves on board his vessel, yet if he does receive them they become free, ' The Hon'ble the Advocate-General states that he is not aware that the Persian Gulf has ever been diplomatically treated as a narrow* p; r sTra»TfiA e ,^^^Z s :^7Ur.hl e sea. Hewould be sorry. wi t hou, Hgher author- the Red Sea or the German Ocean. ity, to say anything which could be construed (sd.) C, (J. A. i n t 0 an admission of the right of the riparian powers in the Persian Gulf, but if it is to be treated politically as a narrow sea the legal consequence follows that it belongs to the surrounding territory or territories in as full and complete a manner as a fresh -water lake, and that such riparian power has jurisdiction ad tnediutu filunt Qquci, without any limitation as to the distance of a marine league in regard to private and merchant vessels. ' The commanders of British vessels would not only be authorized in refusing to surrender a slave who had found refuge on board his vessel; but would incur very serious legal responsibilities if he in any way attempted to coerce that slave to return to his master.' 126 In the May Frere case Colonel Ross quoted the Bombay Advocate- General's opinion given in 1871, and asked for general instructions on the whole question raised. 127. The consequences, he said, of an excessive exercise in the Persian Gulf of the powers vested in commanders of vessels of war would nowhere be more serious than on the pearl banks, where the diving was carried on almost entirely by domestic slaves, who if they found an opportunity might run off to a British vessel a general feeling of consternation and disgust would be produced, and we should no longer be regarded as the friendly protectors of the maritime Arabs. 128. Colonel Ross thought it highly advisable that every means should be taken to induce commanders of vessels whenever practicable to refuse to receive runaways on board, but that this could not always be done consistently with humanity. 129. He sent the slave to Police, with a request that the disposal might be taken. 130. The case was referred Political A., July 1874, Nos. 184-185. Bombay to the care of the Commissioner orders of the Bombay Govment as to its to the Home Government and the following opinion was expressed by the law officers of the Crown (dated 18th April 1874):—64 That the waters of the Persian Gulf must, in our opinion, be considered as sea and subject, according to the distance of any particular part of those waters, to the rules which apply to all incidents in territorial waters, or in the open sea. As to the reception of fugitive slaves on board Her Majesty's ships we are of opinion that, in cases where the slaves have come on board within territorial waters and their surrender is asked for within those waters, they ought to be surrendered. ' The immunity from the law of the country and the privileges conceded to public shins when within territorial waters cannot, we consider, be extended to cases in which the practical result would be in the first instance to encourage and assist a breach of the law of the country, and next to protect the person breaking that law. This question was considered in Forbes versus Cochrane, 2 B. and C . na^e 448 in which the opinion of the Court of King's Bench (of one Judge at least Chief Justict Best page 465) was against the right of protection to fugitive slaves coming o n J boa r d Her Majesty s ships within territorial waters. s uuara ner *. 7 he ^ m . e P nnc, P Ie a . n f authority will apply to ships not being public shins to Those waters terr ' 0r ' al Waters • 5laves ma 3' esca P e . and whose surrender is asked in _ i , t 1 h , e ,? pen ! ea ' h'''P 0 ' t ^ e principle that the ship, whether public or private is a for, n0r ought'!['to b^conccded!''' ^ SUrrender 0f the fu S itive sIave sho ' ld ^ *sked h^itfof e t e c4 a n^fl 0f w a h?ch b h C e ^s^^f wiH b?'^ fb retUrnS the slave 'Grace.'

Were acted Upon.65 132. It was pointed out that under the 1st Article of 1873 with Oman ' all ^ ter,n ^ the r Su ! t , an,s dominions and dependencies shall be fVee,' fl'' argued that unless fugitives were allowed to come on board and tell their story some might be rejected who were held as slaves contrary to the treaty. • . ■^Theparag'aph 5 quoted could not, it was said, be literally construed without the risk that the policy of Government would be violated in practice, slaves escaping to the shores of India across the Arabian Sea would be received and it seemed inexpedient that a British ship in the middle of the Arabian Gulf or a few miles from the Indian coast should be prohibited from receiving them. Again a ship might be riding in the territorial waters of a country which by treaty with the British Government is a free country. Fugitives setting foot on the soil of that country would be free, and there appeared to be no reason why similar fugitives should be forbidden to come on board a British ship riding in its territorial waters. r s 134. Accordingly the following provisions were suggested for considera- tion :— (а) That with regard to ships on the high seas the opinion quoted should only apply to such^ships as being technically in the hi^h seas are neverthless practically brought into close contact with the owners of domestic slaves. (б) That it should not apply to ships riding in the territorial waters of a free country except in a similar contingency. (c) That in the case of territories which are by Treaty partially free or on the road from a state of slavery to one of freedom it is necessary for the due maintenance of our treaties that fugitives should be received in the first instance. (d) That if it is clear that they do not fall under the terms of the treaty, they should be restored to their lawful owners or to the public authorities. (e) That if it is not clear whether they fall under the terms of the treaty they should be surrendered to the public authorities for the pur pose of a proper enquiry. (/) That a representative of the British Government should be a party to the enquiry. (&lt;f) That if it is clear that they do not fall under the terms of the treaty they should be set at liberty. (/t) That the burden of proof lies on the fugitive who is de facto a slave, and should show that he is made so contrary to the treaty. When the case remains in doubt, the benefit of the doubt should be given to the owner. 135. The Secretary of State now forwarded the opinion of the law officers of the Crown on the points suggested by the Government of India and above cited. 136. The law officers referring to their former opinion stated that it was Political A., July 1874, No. 184. ^ or ^ u ^ anc ® an&lt; ^ no1: necessarily applicable to cases where special circum stances exist. 137. For instance in the case of receiving fugitive slaves on board British ships within the territorial waters of Oman the provisions of the treaty must be taken into consideration quite as much as the avoidance of anything that could be interpreted into an encouragement of breaches of the law, and commanding officers must be allowed discretion whether it is not expedient to receive slaves pending an enquiry whether by the terms of the treaty they are entitled to their freedom or not. 138. Practically therefore they have modified the absolute prohibition against receiving slaves, except in cases of pressing danger or to save life, recorded in [C643FD]66 their former opinion, though they were still unable to assent to the proposal of the Government of India that this opinion should— ' {a) only ap}&gt;ly to such ships as being technically on the high seas are nevertheless practically brought into close contact with the owners of domestic slaves ; (b) that it should not apply to ships riding in the territorial waters of a free country except in a similar con tingency.' 139. They said that as a general principle slaves should not be misled into the belief that they would find their liberty by getting under the British flacr or induced by the presence of a British ship to leave their own ships, if at sea or their employment if on shore. With re g ard to the remaining provisions suggested by the Government ot India, the law officers considered that as they appeared to have reference to cases m which treaties exist they might be adopted, but that here also some discretion should be vested in commanding officers to enable them to deal with exceptional cases. 141. As a result of further discussion, which it is not necessary to dilate upon Secref, April 1876, Nos. 10-14. here, the following rules were issued by the I'arliaa.enUry Blue Book, Slave Trads No. 5 Admiralty, with the approval of the Foreicrn ceedings. ^ ?

It is not possible to lay down precise rules as to the cases in which a commander should receive a fugitive slave on board his ship. He must be guided by his own iud?- ment and by considerations of humanity ; and these considerations must have full effect £ V wl!- K ^ et ! ler a ^ hl P. ls 'n the high seas or within the territorial waters of a State • s,aver y exists : but in the latter case, he should be careful to avoid conduct which might appear to be in breach of international comity and good faith. 4. If any person within territorial waters claims protection on the ground that he is kept in slaverj contrary to treaties with Great Britain, the Commander should receive him until the truth of his statement is examined into. This examination should be made if possible, a ter communication with the nearest British Consular authority, and the Com^ iMnder should be guided in his subsequent proceedings by the result. 5.^ Slaves should not be removed from shore and then treated as fugitives. If in any exceptional cases, their removal should seem to be required by considerations of humanity the Commander, who under such circumstances receives a slave on board, should be pre pared to compensate the owner for the loss of his slave. 6. Where a slave is received on board as a fugitive within territorial waters on the » ground of alleged ijl-treatment by his master, his reception should, in the first instance, be regarded as provisional, until inquiry can be made,into the truth of the slave's story either by the officer receiving him or by the nearest British Consular authority. Should it be oecided to take him under the protection of the British flag in a port where there is a British Consular authority, such authority should always be consulted as to his ultimate disposal. 7. A special report is to be made of every case of a fugitive slave received on board an Indian Government ship, in which the Commander will give full particulars of the cir cumstances under which the slave was received on board, stating whether the locality in which he was received was within or beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the country on the coasts of which his vessel may be cruising. 8. In all cases which may arise affecting the relations of a Commander with the authorities of a foreign State, it will be his duty, when practicable, to consult in the first place the Diplomatic or Consular Representative of the British Government at the nearest port.

The Brussels Conference Act, 1890—Article XXVIII provides:— Any slave who may have taken refuge on board a ship of war flying the flag of one of the Signatory Powers shall be immediately and definitely freed ; such freedom, however, shall not withdraw him from the competent jurisdiction, if he has committed a crime or offence at common law.' Surrender of a fugitive slave at Abu Thabi, igo'j. 144, In April 1902, Major Cox (then Political Agent, Maskat) undertook a journey from the Pirate coast to the Mas- External a.. January .903, Noa. ,.4. ^ ^ coast by ^ of and sailed for this purpose to Abu Thabi on H. M. S. Redbreast, On his landing at the place, a slave boy belonging to a kinsman of the Shaikh of Abu Thabi took refuge on the vessel. Major Cox was at the time a guest of the Shaikh, and a dangerous journey through the interior of Oman could not be under taken without his goodwill and guarantee of protection. To give, in the circumstances, shelter to a slave of one of his kinsmen, and liberate him, would, Major Cox feared, not only be regarded as a breach of ^ hospitality, but rouse the indignation of the Shaikh and the Arabs, and the intended journey would have to be given up altogether. ^ In fact' writes Major Cox, 'had68 Commander Quayle felt obliged to take the slave, I should have asked him to take me too, as my time was limited, and it would have discounted the chances of success too much to make the attempt worth the candle.' 145. In these circumstances the slave was, at the request of Major Cox, landed, without being granted freedom under Article XXVIII of the Brussels Conference Act. He was taken possession of by Major Cox, and arrangements were made by him to ransom him. The proceedings were, in the Political Agent's opinion justifiable under paragraph 100 of the Instructions of the Act, which runs:— ' You ought at the same tirne to avoid ccnducti which may appear to be in breach of an international county and good faith.' 146. The Resident, Colonel Kemball, thought that Major Cox's explana tion ot his conduct was entirely satisfactory, an opinion on which the Govern- mem Of India concurred (despatch to the Secretary of State.

The practice followed at the Arab Coast, Bushire and at Maskat appears from the reports of the Political Agent at Maskat and the Resident at Bushire to have been as follows :— ' Slaves imported to the Arab Coast and Bahrein subsequent to[the dates of the agree- , Bahrein. ments noted in the margin, with the various f Ras-ul-khimah.

The practice of manumitting slaves hitherto observed in Maskat is as fellows:— When a slave applies for freedom at this Consulate, his statement is taken down in writing. He is then sent to the Sultan with the Agency Munshi for the purpose of verifying his statement made at this Consulate for His Highness' consent to his freedom. The Sultan, after questioning the slave, either informs the Munshi that the slave may be freed when he finds him to be of recent importation or of date subsequent to the treaty of &lt;873, or in doubtful cases, i .e., when the date of the slave's importation cannot be clearly ascertained. His Highness requests that the slave may be detained for a short time, 10 to 15 days, pending the arrival of his master to claim him. If one comes and cannot produce before the Consul satisfactory evidence that the man was imported before the treaty, or if no one comes within the period mentioned, the slave is given freedom with the consent of the Sultan. In recent years, cases of slaves imported before the treaty seeking freedom at this Consulate have been rare. To such freedom is denied, or rather the Sultan is not asked to give his consent unless cruelty or inhuman treatment is proved, in which case freedom is given with the consent of the Sultan ; otherwise, when slaves not entitled to freedom under treaty appear to be well fed and clothed, and in good condition, they are told they are not entitled to freedom, and are returned to their masters by the Sultan,'who makes the masters sign a bond, by which they undertake to treat the slaves thus returned with kindness. Since 1897 Commander Baker, H.M.S. Sphinx, inaugurated the practice of granting freedom papers to slaves taking refuge on board H. M. ship under his command within Maskat waters without reference to the Consul or to the Sultan, but the latter has objected to this procedure. I have consulted Commander Philliops, who is at present in command of H. M. S. Sphinx, and that officer agrees with me in thinking it undesirable to continue Commander Baker's practice, and the former practice of sending slaves (who have taken refuge on Her Majesty's vessels within Maskat waters) to this Consulate will in future be adhered to. 153. From the Secretary of State's despatch No. 32-Secret, dated 7th July Secret e., September 1899, Nos. 2-4. *899, k was understood tbat His Lordship j. . . , dld not intend that there should be any disturbance of the existing practice so long as the Sultan continued to act on the advice of the Consul and did not unreasonably refuse his consent to manumission when the Consul recommended that course. At the same time attention was drawn to sections 99 to 101 o{ the Imtructions to naval officers providing an alternative procedure which might prove useful on occasion (Government of India to the Resident, No. 1229-E. A., dated 16th August 1899). 154. It should be mentioned here also that the Government of India autho- Secret e., May 1899, N01. 116-128, rized the Resident to inform the various . j • . 1 • t ^ e ^hs in his political charge, at such time and m such manner as he might see fit, that the British Government would welcome the extension of a system favourable to the liberation of slaves (No , 4 2 7'E- A., dated 13th October 1898). (iii) Question of interpretation of article I of the anti-slave treaty of i37i with H ip Sultan of Maskat, 1893. 154-A. In 1892 a question was raised about the interpretation of the con- Extemai a., Septemberi89a, Nos. 231-236. eluding words of article I of the slave-trade MocW • trsat y°t concluded with the Sultan of askat in connection with an African boy who sought protection at the British Consulate at Maskat against cruel treatment by his mistress and claimed his freedom. 1 he boy was born at Arbak near Maskat of parents who had been imported as slaves to Maskat territory before the treaty of 187v Both the boy and his father went more than once to Calcutta in recent years, and volun! tanly returned to Maskat. His Highness the Sultan was of opinion that the boy ^g^rded as a slave whose status is not affected by the treaty On the other hand, the officer in charge of the Political Agency and Copulate at Maskat (Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Jayakar) contended that the boy was entitled to h.s freedom under Art,cle ' of the Treaty as a person who had entered Hb Highness the Sultan s territories since the date of the treaty.7i W ith you 'in thrnkingTha^th^view'heldll^His^Hil^ness the'^ 1 * ]t^ enera ' agreeS therefore must be held to have abandoned (as he has a right to do)' IhT/ritneg'; 0 he had gamed by enter,ng Bnt.sh territory, and to have reverted 8 to his original s i „s as a slave T r ( ul ; n g c ? ve t rs a11 ^ of Persons who have been lawfully slaves in Muscat either bv .mportat,on before the date of the Treaty of ,873. or by birth before or ^e that date At the same t.me it appears to the Government of India that the words of the reaty relied on by Dr Jayakar «ould apply to all persons brought to Muscat otherwise than by their own voluntary act for the first time after the date of the treaty, whether they were brought for sale or as the private slaves of the importer. 7 vvnetner tA v./'fr!.! ^'ai, ''i 0 ' 1 ' ie a ! :&gt;0 , vc r ' l ' n ' ^t the boy in question is not entitled to claim to be free. As he has appealed to the Consulate for protection against cruelty, endeavours may properly be made, as you propose, to obtain a guarantee that he will not be ill-treated after he is surrendered. (iv) Question of giving protection to runaway slaves at Jask station, 1885. *55' ^84 four runaway slaves took refuge at the telegraph village at External a ., May 1885, nos. 1.31. t ? sk ' whom the Governor oi the place, . . Sheikh Abdul Nabi, claimed back. Mr. Patten, Assistant Superintenc'ent in charge Jask, agreed to send them back if a written undertaking was given that they would not be illtreated, about which they had complained. This was given, but the slaves, who had been ordered to leave the neighbourhood of the telegraph village, escaped to H. M. S. Dragon. The question of dealing with them now passed the naval authorities. 156. As regards allowing runaway slaves to take refuge at the telegraph village at Jask, the following order was issued by Colonel Ross through Mr. Ffinch to the Superintendent at Jask station (Mr. Ffinch to the Superintendent, dated 18th December 1884) :— ' Slaves at Jask are to be treated just as at Bushire, that is refused admission to telegraph or Government premises or places, over which we exercise any control. The telegraph village is to be treated as if Government buildings. It is of course repugnant to people's feelings to reject appeals for protection, but it must be firmly done, for if runaway slaves think they can come in, they will come in great numbers, and we should incur the hostility of the people and injury to the telegraph line.' 157. On this subject the Government of India (Foreign Department letter No. 517-E., dated 11th April 1885) taking into consideration the extra-territorial status of these stations and also the facility with which slaves could find admission into them, were disposed to approve of these instructions, but they wished to add to them the proviso that— ' Exception should be made in cases where, owing to the slave being placed in imminent danger or otherwise, considerations of humanity may dictate an opposite course.' (v) Question of giving protection to fugitive slaves at the telegraph station at Henjam, 1904. 158. While at Maskat in May 1904, Commander Kemp received a telegram from Mr. Lobo, telegraph clerk at Secret E., February 1905, Nos. i-4S. Henjam, saying that a man from a dhow lying at Henjam had asked protection on ihe ground of being kidnapped from the Mekran coast. Commander Kemp instructed Mr. Lobo by telegram to detain the dhow until his arrival. He arrived at Henjam on 9th May and enquired into the matter.72 159- The complainant stated that he was a Baluchi of the name of Esa and that he had been kidnapped from Gurdeen, a place near Tank on the Mekran coast. On arrival at Henjam he managed to escape to the telegraph camp, where he was received and protect , ed until the arrival of the Sphinx. 160. The dhow belonged to a place called Shuza on the Kishm Island. Its Nakhoda and crew asserted that the boy Esa had been taken at Gurdeen as one of the crew on payment to him of 20 dollars. The dhow had no name and papers of any sort whatever. 161. As the only evidence against the Nakhoda was that of the boy himself, Commander Kemp stated the facts of the case in telegram to Major Cox and asked for his instructions. The Resident replied that having in view the readiness with which indigent Mekranis placed themselves in such situations, he did not think the case was one for detention and adjudication and advised the release of the dhow after warning the Nakhoda. 162. When Major Cox was asked to explain more fully his reasons for the course he had advised, he stated the following grounds among others ' We had only just asserted ourselves at Henjam and it was undesirable to have inconvenient questions in connection therewith. While the action of the telegraph clerk in detaining the dhow at Commander Kemp's orders was no doubt morally justi fiable, it would certainly have been difficult for His Majesty's Minister to justify it on political grounds, at any rate it would have been particularly inconvenient at that moment to have had such a question raised as would have been the case without the slightest doubt, if the dhow had been brought up for adjudication by a Persian court.' 163. As to the procedure to be followed in future cases, the Government SecretE., December .904, No S . 7 o-, 1. of ''J 3 (Foreign Department letter No. 2416-E. A., dated 30th July 1904) authorised the Resident to issue to the officer in charge of the telegraph station at Henjam instructions in the sense of those approved in the Foreign Department letter No. dated 1 ith April 1885 (see paragraph 157 above).73 CHAPTER IX. Some questions of practice of Courts. (i) The ' Rokeby ' case, 1877. 164. Th- British S. S. Rokeby arrived at Bushire from Jedda on Political a ., December 1879, Nos. i2i-is3. '3^ March iS'j'j. In consequence tQ the Residency to board the Rokeby, and to request the Captain to detain pend- mg further orders any slaves found on board. In pursuance of these orders t e esidency official searched the Rokeby and reported the discovery of a newly-imported male slave, alleged to belong to one Ka Nushad, a Persian subject. ^ slave wa s g^en m charge to one Siyyed Ahmed, also a Persian subject, and was landed by him at Bushire. p • l65 nffi n re A ceivin S this information Captain Prideaux wrote to the Persian Foreign Office Agent and obtained the slave whose name was Abdulla from him Captain Prideaux also communicated with Captain Clayton, Commanding . M. Rifleman, then lying in Bushire harbour, who deputed Lieute nant Hockin to search the Rokehy with the result that six female slaves together with another male slave by name Faraj, were discovered and seized' Prideaux^ 11 ^ 0f Clayt0n and made 0ver to Ca P tai ' c 166. On the following day Captain Prideaux held an enquiry into the case with Captain Clayton and was convinced ' that the boys and girls were Gallas and Abyssimans, 'ew y imported into Jedda from the opposite Egyptian coast, and so Id there probably with the object of being resold on their arrival in Persia or Turkey. 167. After this enquiry H. M. S. Rifleman sailed for Maskat leav ing the slaves in Captain Prideaux's charge. It appears that this was an accidental arrangement arnsing from the fact of one of the slaves having had small-pox ; otherwise the Rifleman would have taken them away. Maskat is the nearest port to Bushire where there is a consular East African Court and on arrival there Captain Clayton demanded adjudication of the slaves. 168. The proceedings before the Maskat Court will be found in enclosure No. Ill of Colonel Ross's report ; the decision and order were as follows :— ' In Her Britannic Majesty's Consular Court at Maskat on the twenty-fifth day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven. Before Samuel Barret Miles, Colonel. Our Sovereign Lady the Queen against two male and six female blaves seized by Captain Francis Starkie Clayton, Commanding H. M, S. Riflemun, on the I3ih day of March 1877. Having read the proofs and heard the evidence in this case, it appears to me that the said two male and six female slaves were being held in slavery on board the British Ship Rokeby contrary to law, and that the said eight slaves have been handed over to the Politiral Resident at Bushire, and I therefore pronounce the said eight slaves to have been lawfully seized ana to be forfeited to our Sovereign Lady the Queen, and I condemn the same accordingly. In witness whereof I havs signed this decree, and caused my seal of office to be affixed thereto this twenty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and teventy-seven.' 169. It will be seen that while Captain Clayton had only seized seven slaves the court dealt with eight slaves, thus including the boy Abdulla with the rest. It will be convenient to mention here the subsequent disposal of these eight slaves. Of the six women, one died, and the remaining five were on their own request sent to Basra where they rejoined the persons who claimed them. With regard to the boy Abdulla who belonged to a Persian subject correspondence passed between the Resident at Bushire, Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran, and the Persian authorities, and in accordance with Mr. Thomson's suggestion Abdulla was deported to Bombay. The other boy, Faraj, was also sent to Bombay, but his restoration was claimed by one Haji Yusuf, a Turkish subject. The fact C643FD74 that these two slaves were at Bombay precluded their restoration to their respective owners, and no further action in respect to them was required. 170. But the legality of the proceedings of the Resident in Bushire and of the Consular Court at Maskat were called in question, and as our legal advisers themselves differed, the points were referred to the Home Government. The following opinions were expressed on the several points that arose in this case by the Law Officers of the Crown Secret, October 1880, Not. 73-77. (their letter, dated 1st March 1880, to the Foreign Office) ' That in our opinion Captain Prideaux, acting with the sanction of the 'Persian author ities, was justified in his search on board the British Steam Ship Rokeby while lying in Bushire harbour. Captain Prideaux would have had no authority to seize and detain the boy Abdulla without the intervention of the Persian authorities, and he was justified in obtaining the surrender of Abdulla by and through the intervention of the Persian authorities. Captain Clayton was, in our opinion, not justified in seizing the seven slaves owned by toreigners on board a British private vessel lying in a foreign harbour. Such vessel was subject to the jurisdiction of the country within the territory of which she was lying, and the action of Captain Clayton was contrary to the principles and practice of international law. The proper course for Captain Clayton to have adopted would have been to apply for and obtain the intervention of the Persian authorities. The case in our' opinion ought not toTiavebeen brought before the Mascat Court. We entirely agree with Mr. Phillipps that that Court has no jurisdiction at all in the matter. And supposing the Court to have had jurisdiction, the slaves, in respect to whom it was to adjudicate, should have been brought before the Court, or at least have been within its local jurisdiction. Lastly, we are of opinion that a slave does not absolutely obtain his freedom by having been on board a British private ship, and that if such a slave returns to the country of his master, and where slavery is recognised, Her Majesty's Government could not properly insist upon such a slave being liberated or held to be fr«e. 171. On a further reference the Law Officers stated (their letter, dated 16th ■ Political a., July .88., No,. 75 :8. January 1 88 1}— ' That, in our opinion, a British officer is not, under 36 and 37 Vict,, Chap. f8, section 3, justified in seizing slaves on board a British vessel within the waters of a Foreign State without the consent by treaty or otherwise of such state, in cases where the vessel is ' engaged in, or fitted out for the slave trade/ The question raised by the Indian Government, whether the Consular Court at Maskat has jurisdiction as a Court of Admiralty to condemn vessels or slaves when brought within its jurisdiction without regard to the place where they are captured, or whether the jurisdiction of that Court is limited to vessels and slaves suspected of being used and detained for the purpose of the slave trade within the dominions of Maskat, is one of considerable difficulty. If it rested only on the construction of the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act, 1873, we think it would be held that the Consul at Maskat was entitled to exercise only the more limited jurisdiction. We think the definition of ' East African Courts ' contained in that Act, when read with section 3, limited the jurisdiction of the Consul to cases where he was acting within the powers conferred upon him by order in Council. But an Act has since been passed [the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act, 187Q], to which the attention of the Government of India does not appear to have been called, which materially alters the Act of 1870. By the late Act a new definition is substituted for the term '• East African Court.' And when this new definition is read with section 3 of the Act of 1873, we think, though the point is not free from doubt^ that the jurisdiction of the Consul is no longer limited as it was before. W e write this on the assumption tint this extended jurisdiction is consistent with the terms of the treaty between this country and the Imam of Maskat, which is not before us,'Q 75 (ii) Capture of slave dhows by the ' Philomel/' 1885. 173. H. M. S. Philomel captured in October 1884 a dhow with 154 External a ., March ,885, No S . ^23. slaves off the Ras-el-Hadd, and proceed ings in the case were taken in the Maskat vice-Admiralty Court. Soon afterwards the same vessel captured another dhow with^i slaves near the Masira Island on its way to Aden, and the case was disposed off at Aden. The proceedings taken in both these cases being typical ot the rest are printed in extenso below. They will show (i) how the captures of slaves were made; (2) the proceed ings in the Vice-Admiralty Courts ; (3) the way the slaves were dealt with after these proceedings ; (4) what money was spent on the slaves, etc. :— No. 298, dated Muscat, 31st October 1884. From — L ieut.- C ol. S. B. M iles, H. B. M .'s Political Agent and Consul, Muscat, 1 o— L ibut. -C ol E. C. Ross, C.S. I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and Her Majesty 's Consul-oeneral for Fars. My telegram of the 14th instant, post copy of which is attached, will have already acquainted you with the capture by H. M. S. Philomel of an Arab dhow with one * 128 male. hundred and fifty-four slaves* on board ; and 20 female. I have now the honour to report that the case has since been brought into this Vice-Admiralty Court for adjudication, and the dhow con demned with cargo. 2. The circumstances of the capture as related to me by Captain Lang are as follows On the 18th instant the Philomel was lying at anchor near Ras-Had watching for slavers when she sighted a dhow coming up from the south-west. Chase was made under sail, but as the dhow gained rapidly a gun was fired across her bows as a signal to heave to. No notice was taken of this by the nakhoda of the dhow who now steered in straight for the shore with the obvious intention of beaching his vessel—a manoeuvre which Captain Lang, having in the meantime got steam up, was fortunately able to prevent by intercept ing her before she reached it. The nakhoda seeing all was lost abandoned the dhow in his small boat, accompanied by several of the slave-dealers, and made for the shore. Three of the Arab dealers were captured by the boats, but the nakhoda and five of the dealers succeeded in escaping. 3. From the evidence of the crew and some of the slaves recorded in Court, it appears that the dhow sailed from Zanzibar on the loth of September last for Dar-el-Salaam, a port on the mainland to the south of and about 40 miles distant from the town of Zanzibar. At this place the dealers who had previously sent agents across to collect a cargo, shipped the greater number of the slaves and others were taken in subsequently at Mboamaji and Ras Ndege, from which latter place the dhow sailed on the 2lst September for Oman, her destination being El Khudthra, on the Batinah Coast. 4. The slaves were for the most part Wazaramo, a coast tribe engaged in cultivation and in'the collection of gum, copal, and caoutchouc. They are by no means a wild people and but seldom, I believe, fall into slavery. The famine prevailing this year in their country has probably been the cause of their falling easy victims to the slave-hunters. The slaves were found to be in a wretched state on board the dhow when captured, and most of the children were mere skeletons. Provisions and water had run short on the way, and for two days none had been issued. 6 The crew, and those of the passengers whom I ascertained to have no interest in the car^o I released. But six of the Arabs on board who^ were proved to be slave-dealers 1 handtTd over to His Highness Seyyid Turki, who immediately imprisoned them in Meiani fort pending the pleasure of Government. His Highness has also sent orders to Soor to arrest the nakhoda and has intimated to me his intention of imprisoning him. - On arrival at Muscat with the dhow Captain Lang found a telegram from the Admiral await in o' him, directing him to proceed at once to Aden, and 011 my representing the difficulty I should have in arranging for the reception of the slaves on shore and for their shipment to Bombay, he decided to take them on with him to that port. Nine ot the slaves, however, seven males and two females, were in a sickly sta^ and unfit for the vovafe I took charge of. Two of these have since died in hospital. The others will arrange to dispose of locally under surveillance or will send to Bombay in a man-of-war. o Amono-the nakhoda of the dhow's effects was found a large packet of letters, and from thesH .TaleVeen able to extract a good deal of • , r(r r ^ cinvp.dealers It appears that the pners for slaves at Dar-el-balaam tins s ason ranged froin five to thirty dollars. That the nakhoda had a small venture ot n.neteca's£l 76 slaves on board whicli had cost him two hundred and forty dollars, and that he was to receive eight hundred dollars from the slave-dealers as freight for the rest of the cargo. The letters mention further that another slave dhow was shortly to follow this one. 9. The information obtained from the correspondence confirms the reports that had before reached me to the effect that a large importation of slaves has taken place this year from the Zanzibar coast to Arabia. For the past ten years this slave transport by sea has been without doubt practically in abeyance, owing chiefly, as I believe, to the vigilance and energy of the naval force engaged in patrolling the East African Coast. But this check has lately been in a great measure removed, and a widespread belief has arisen among the Arabs that the former restrictions placed by the British Government on the slave trade have been withdrawn. The preventive measures adopted in his territories by the Sultan of Zanzibar are, in my humble opinion, neither sincere nor effective, and as the slave trade may now be expected to continue, I would respectfully suggest that the southern coast of Arabia and the entrance to the Persian Gulf be carefully watched by His Majesty's cruisers during the next south-west monsoon, viz., from April to October.

On the 18th October 1884, about 10 a.m., she sighted a dhow about seven miles off ; steered for her and when she got within half a mile the dhow lowered her sail She had no colours flying at the time. Lieutenant Henderson and Muhanamad Ah, Interpreter, the second and third witnesses, were sent in a boat to visit the dhow ; they boarded her and found slaves on board, who, on seeing the boarding officer came near the water casks saying that they were very thirsty as they got rice one day and water the other. The dhow was detained in latitude 21 0 9' N., and longitude 59° 14' E The slaves were found to be 30 males and 21 females. They were removed to H M S Philomel and the dhow was taken in tow.

Abdulla Musullum, Ahmed Musullum, Ishmail Murad, and Abdulla Salim state that they are subjects of the Sultan of Muscat. Obeid Salim states that he is the subject of Ibrahim-bin Kaia, the brother of the late Imam of Muscat. Abdulla Musullum, Ahmed, Ishmail. and Obeid further state that they took from Muscat to Zanzibar dates and other goods for sale, at which place they purchased piece-goods and went into the interior, about six days' journey, to a place called Beera, where they exchanged their goods for slaves ; from Beera they went to Fingani, where they settled with the nakhoda Rubheir to go in his Sumbook to Botnah with the slaves, at dollars eight per head ; Abdulla Salim, a boy about 12 years of age, states that he went to Zanzibar with his father, thence to Fingani, where he remained whilst his father went into the interior ; his father died there about one year ago, and three slaves, the property of his father, were brought to him and seeing the others had agreed to ship slaves at doilars eight a head, he also embarked in the Sumbook for Botnah where his mother lived.

The admissions of the nakhoda and the owners of the slaves, the evidence of Captain Lang, Lieutenant Henderson and the Interpreter, Muhammad Ali, and the presence of 51 slaves on board the dhow when she was captured, show, that the Arab dhow Fateh-al- Khair was engaged in the slave trade, and that the dhow the slaves found on board and the money and valuables were lawfully seized by H. M. S. Philomel and are liable to forfeiture to the Crown, and further that it was impracticable to bring the said Arab dhow Fateh-al-Khair to this port, and H. M. S. Philomel was justified in destroying the same. The Court therefore passes the accompanying decree. A DEN ; (Sd.)

In regard to the sum of Rs. 2,288-8-6 expended by the Political Resident at Aden To the Government of Bombay, No. 1906 -P.. on account of these slaves, I am to inquire, with dated 22nd August 1873. reference to previous correspondence, ending with the endorsement from this office cited in the margin, whether any steps are being taken by the Government of Bombay to recover the charges incurred from the Home Treasury. (iii) Question of the trial of a case of a slaver captured by the Political Agent, Maskat, 1896. 173. In May 1896 Lieutenant Beville, Political Agent, Maskat, received information to the effect that a vessel External a., Acgust 1896, Nos, 47- s 2 ' hailing from Sur within the dominions of the Sultan of Maskat and containing slaves was in the vicinity of Maskat. There being no vessel of war upon the station and considering that the last paragraph of section 3 of Vict. 36 and 37, Chapter 88, read with Article I of the Treaty of 1873 with the Sultan of Maskat, empowered them as a military officer to do so, he proceeded to the sea in his boat and effected capture of the vessel with 27 slaves. Four slave dealers and the crew found on the vessel, who were natives of Sur, were handed over to the Sultan, by whom they were imprisoned after enquiry. 174. The question raised then was whether Lieutenant Beville having cap- External A., ]„i y .897, No,, t . ured I the , slayers could exercise jurisdic tion tor the trial and condemnation of the vessel, crew and slaves taken. 'yS- The Government of India were of opinion that Lieutenant Beville could not try the case and instructed the Resident at Bushire to consult the Appellate Court as to the course to be pursued. 176. The Registrar of the Admiralty Division, Royal Courts of Justice, London, advised the Political Agent (letter, dated 14th July 1896) as follows u ^ does not seem to be a case which the Consular Court of Maskat or any other of the so-called East African Courts has authority to try, the jurisdiction of those Courts being limited by section 3 (36 and 37 Vict., Chapter 59) of the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act, 1873, to vessel seized by the Commander or officer of any of Her Majesty's ships. If that be so, I am afraid that the case could only be tried under section 5 of the Act, 30 and 37 Vict., Chapter 88) in some Court of Admiralty within British territory. The nearest and most accessible court would, I suppose, be the Court at Bombay. The Registrar also raised the question of the legality of the seizure. i/6. The questions were then referred by Lieutenant Beville for the opinion of the Advocate General, Bombay. His opinion is quoted below : Opinion by the Advocate General, Bombay. With reference to the case submitted for my opinion as to the seizure by the Political Agent at Maskat of a vessel containing slaves, I am of opinion as follows I think it is extremely doubtful if the seizure was legal. The vessel seized came from K 6 V ^ of ^ Sultan of Maskat, and prim&amp; facie she would Sbv-P T 0 . be A a V ' ess c 0 a f 0 F e, g n St ate within the meaning of those words, as defined by the a f 7 3, - eCtl S n2 ' '•'''a vessel which is justly entitled to claim the protec- oi the flag of a foreign State, or which would be so entitled if she did not lose such8i protection by bein^ engaged in the Slave Trar?^ w If i.' r , ^ F^^Mrjesty^s'sh i^ OU ld h aut ^ orise ^erseizure only by the Commanderor officer of any' of If the seizure was properly made, I think the Bombay High Court in its Adtriraltv the'doiibt^as 7^1 ^ Vt C0Urt t0 try ^ condemn the vesseI i but, having regard to the doubt as to the legal,ty of the seizure, and to the fact that the crew and slave-uwners brL b r HL a!rea r V r niShed Sultan, that the slaves have been apparently disposed of tlkZZTr^r 0 lZ W T VeSSel it 1 self is worthless, it woulci seem undelirable to y p cee in »s in the matteri until the orders of Government are obtained. I do not think article i of the Treaty with the Sultan of Maskat, dated 14th April 1871 strengthens the case ; that article merely provides that any vessels engaged in the transport ZrnI7!! y , inCe I S 'T S S J 1 be , liable t0 se ' zure by all such naval and other officers or P^v fl' :iy . author,sed l for that purpose on the part of Her Britannic Majesty. If the Political Agent was not authorised by the Statute above mentioned, he cannot rely on the C643FDrSir''—' 82 CHAPTER X. 177. In Political A countermarks. Miscellaneous questions and facts. (i) Incidence of slave trade charges. 1870 the Bombay Government forwarded returns of the slaves that August 1873, Nos. 221-222 and had been landed and liberated at Aden during the five preceding years. The expenses involved in the transport and maintenance of these slaves amounted to abouMil lakhs of rupees. The Government of India submitted the question to the Home Government as to whether this expenditure should be borne by the revenues of India. They contended that the capture of slaves as well as their subsequent maintenance and^transport were carried out by Her Majesty's Gov ernment under Act of Parliament, and had nothing to do with India and were not connected in any way with Indian Administration.^ They therefore requested that steps might be taken by Her Majesty's Government for the transfer of the charges from the revenues of India to the Imperial Treasury. 178^ After considerable correspondence with the Home Government regard ing ceitain information required by the Lords Commissioners of Her Maiestv's Ireasury the amount expended by the Indian Government, viz.* -f 14. 021-^.8 was repaid (despatch of Duke of Argyll, No. 84, dated 10th July 1873) 179. In 1881 some slaves were captured and brought to Maskat bv the Dryad and the Government of India sanctioned the expenditure of Rs. 2^0 for their passages to Bombay. • iur 180.

What action was taken on this request, it is not clear. 185. In 1885 expenditure was incurred by the Resident at Aden to the ^rch^.«'xori No ' M - f' 0 ''' 0 ' Rs - ',884-8-6 on account of WaS tse'Tl^P^r B T A bay Gove ] , r ' me ' t 10 ^Imperial Gove'rnmm'London' 11 186.

The Goyemmentof India admitted the charge, but invited the Resident's attention to this letter No. 2731-G., dated 16th November 188^ (above quoted) and inormed him that the Comptroller, India Treasuries, had been told that the charges should be dehted to Her Majesty's Imperial Government (letter No. 775-G., dated 21st May 1885). 187. In March 1888 the Government of India received a despatch from the e ' S a :: K S Not.6^°: SeC u re ^J ? f H St t e . rec l u , iri 'g information . , , . , on He 1 ' Majesty s Ireasury as to the circumstances under which certain slaves were received and dieted at the Maskat Consulate, for the maintenance of whom the Comptroller of India Trea suries had held Her Majesty's Government liable in the lists of such charo-es which he submitted direct to the India Office. &amp; 188. The information was given in a letter from the Officiating Political Agent at Maskat, No. I47» dated the 19th May 1888, which accompanied despatch No, 104, dated the Qoth June 1888. It was explained in that letter that the slaves in question were fugitive slaves from the province of Oman, who either sought protection at the Consulate from the cruel treatment of their masters, or claimed their liberty under the stipulations of the Treaty of 1873 with the Maskat Government 5 that during the investigation of their cases, etc., they were protected and dieted at the Consulate ; that this practice had been followed since 1874; and that the expenditure on that account, although an Imperial charge, had before been debited to the contingent account of the Maskat Agency. 189. Since then certain further charges of a similar nature were incurred and the Comptroller-General likewise showed them in his lists of charges against the Imperial Government. The total amount involved up to May last was ^13-10-11. 190. Her Majesty's Treasury declined to admit the liability of the Imperial revenues for the charge in question for the following reasons:— (1) that it was a complete novelty, and involved the change of practice of 14 years' standing: (2) that the charge had no direct connection with the suppression of the slave trade, the slaves not being ' captured negroes/' but domes tic slaves who had sought protection at the agency from cruelty, or who had claimed their liberty under the Treaty of 1873 with the Maskat Government. 191. The Government of India replied as follows to the Secretary of State's External A., May ,88 5 , No,. .62-69. despatch referred to above 2, In reply, we have the honour to enclosef a letter from the Political Resident in the t No. 353, dated the 4th December 18S8, and Persian Gulf, and to submit that, for the reasons enclosure. which we are about to state, the charges are not such as the Indian tax-payer can fairly be compelled to pay. The Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury considered that the expenditure is properly classed as contingent expenditure of the Agency, and for this reason, and because it has hitherto been debited to India, they consider that it ought not in future to be borne by Imperial funds. As regards the argument based on past procedure, we desire to explain that the procedure hitherto followed has been allowed to continue so long undisturbed because the fact of the charges being debited to Indian revenues was not brought to our notice, and it has only been brought to our notice now through the action of our Comptroller of India Treasuries, taken in consequence of certain orders issued by us in 1884 in connection with the suppression of the slave trade. Your Lordship will observe from the enclosure to this despatch that the charges in question are entirely the outcome of the Treaty of the 14th April 1873 (84 between the United Kingdom and Muscat ; and it is in his consular capacity, in which he is solely an agent of, and derives his authority from the English Government, that all the proceedings of the Political Agent connected with slave dieting and liberation are con ducted. It is true that we pay him and make no demand on England for the services rendered by him as Consul, but we cannot admit the justice of the reasoning which deduces from this arrangement the liability of India for the extraordinary charges which he incurs in his capacity as a representative of the Imperial Government. 3. If it be decided that the revenues of this country must bear, these charges, we hope it will be left to our discretion to determine whether and to what extent they shall be incurred in future. 192.

Information was received in April 1896 that, in the previous February, External A., May 1897, Nos. 148*153. ,6 11,6,1 ha&lt;1 been kidnapped off the southern coast of Arabia by a vessel belong ing to the Yal Saad tribe on the Batineh Coast. The Shaikh concerned was at once arrested and imprisoned by the Sultan of Maskat, but the captives had been sold on the Pirate Coast. Towards the close of the year, one slave was traced to a to wn in the inte rior; but the owner demanded a ransom of $ 180. The Shaikh of the Yal Saad had meanwhile died in prison and the Sultan of Maskat was unable to levy this sum from his tribe. Tne Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was of opinion that the only hope of ascertaining the whereabouts of the other captive boy in the immediate release of this slave. The Government of India therefore authorised the payment of the sum demanded as ransom, and proposed to debit it in the account current with Her Majesty's Government, in which all fines recovered fiom Chiefs on the Arab Coast for breaches of the slave trade treaties were credited. 194.

(ii) Disposal of emancipated slaves, 1897-1902. 195* It had long been the practice to send to Bombay Africans manumitted Secret e ., June 1889, Nos. 76-85. at ^ a skat, and the liability for charges . . . , , , connected with their dieting and liberation had been admitted by the Imperial Exchequer. In 1889 the Government of Bombay called attention to the question of the disposal of emancipated slaves representmg that the number of Africans in the City of Bombay was con siderable, that they formed an excitable and turbulent element in the popula tion, and that constant additions to their number might prove a source of risk. nquines were then made as to the feasibility of finding employment for freed slaves elsewhere than in India. It was not considered possible, however, to in any way utilize liberated slaves on the Somali Coast, and the Governments of he Straits Settlements, Sarawak^ and the Fiji Islands, who were consulted at the Government of India s suggestion by the Bombay Government, were not pre pared to receive emancipated Africans. The Government of British North Borneo intimated that they might find employment for freed slaves, provided they were strong, capable of work, and able to bear the climate. At this stage the Bombay Government allowed the matter to drop. 196. In 1897 the Government of India raised objections to the importation External a., January 1897, Noj. i73-jy7. ^ liberated Africans into India, and as it „ 1 r , appeared probable that the freed slaves nprhanl h rl t Pre '1° S&lt; ; nt t0 Africa ' ^ to Mombasa, where they could Her MaV t ge0U y emp o&gt; ' ed ' the &gt;' asked the Secretary of State whether ' v fo piE S f .ff 0V t er t me . n v,- Were pre P ared * 0 take suc h steps as might be neces- January 1897) suggestion (despatch No. S-External. dated ^th85 197- From enquiries made by the Home Government, it was found that External a ., August 1897, Nos 17-24. ^ lr Mathews (Minister to the Sultan . , , , , , . Zanzibar) was prepared to employ emanapated slaves on the plantation of the Zanzibar Government in the islands o Zanzibar and remba. Mr. A. Hardinge (Consul-General at Zanzibar) enume rated other ways in which they could be employed as hamals, carriers, etc. 198. Major Meade (Resident in the Gulf) stated that these suggestions for External A., January 1898, Nos. 122-130. employment of slaves liberated within his charge were feasible, provided the neces sary tunds were forthcoming for despatching them to Zanzibar. Lieutenant-Colonel Loch (Resident at Baghdad) reported that not more than 2 per cent, of the liberated slaves in I urkish Arabia desired to leave the country and that at least 90 per cent, of the males and all the females belonged to the domestic class for whom there was no opening at Zanzibar. No expenditure was incurred by the Resident in Turkish Arabia upon slaves after their emancipation. The Govern ment of India in submitting these reports to the Secretary of State stated that no further action appeared necessary in respect to slaves freed in Turkish Arabia, while in regard to those freed within the Gulf Residency charge, Colonel Meade had been directed to take the necessary measures in direct communication with the Consul-General at Zanzibar (despatch No. 175-External, dated 30th Decem ber 1897). External A., Februaiy 1900, Nos. 22'24. 199;. The proposed procedure was ap- proved in the becretary of State's despatch No. 178, dated 27th November 1889. 200. In July 1899 three slaves who were manumitted at Bushire were sent External A., February 1900, Nos. 22-24. Itl the Lapwing to Maskat for despatch to Zanzibar, one of them having volunteered to serve in the Lapwing was allowed to remain on board. There were no buggalows under the British flag to sail to Zanzibar, and as it was not desirable to send them by vessels under Arab or foreign colours and no vessels under trust worthy nakhodas were always available at Bombay, the Government of India directed at the Resident's suggestion that they should be sent to Zanzibar by steamer at a cost of Rs. 159 each, and that the same course should be adopted in future (Foreign Department letter to the Resident, No. I45-E.A., dated 16th January 1900). 201. From the reports of the Resident at Bushire it appears that the num- , . . .. - her of slaves, who were likely to be sent External A., August 1900, Nos. 50-50. x A/r i - A v 'u 11 . , trom Maskat to Zanzibar, woidd not exceed fifteen each year, while the number from the Gulf would be very small. The . „ , Foreign Office agreed to bear the charges External A., November loco, Nos. 23-25. r .i e -.,11 . tor the passage ot manumitted slaves to Zanzibar at the rate proposed for a period of two years as an experiment (Secre tary of State's despatch No. 114-Political, dated 27th September 1900). 202. From a statement forwarded by the Resident in November 1902, it External A., January ,903, Nos. 22-23. appears that from February 1900 to May 1902, 35 manumitted slaves were despatch- External a , may 1903, Nos. 58-59. to Zanzibar, of whom 28 were sent direct from Maskat by sailing ships under arrangements made by the Political Agent, Maskat, at a cost of a little over Rs. 15 a head; and the remaining 7 were sent by steamer by way of Bombay and Aden. The Resident was of opinion that these arrangements being very economical might be conveniently con tinued, and on the recommendation of the Government of India, the Home Gov ernment sanctioned their continuance (Secretary of State's despatch No. 26- Political, dated 27th March 1903). (Hi) Disposal of fines recovered from Chiefs in the Gulf for slave trade offences by their subjects. 203. In case of offences connected with slave trade committed within the Secret e ., April 1895, No.. 5-14. territory of the Trucial Chiefs, who are Secret e , July 1896, Nos. 260-263. bound by slave-trade treaties, the practice had for long been to hold the Chief responsible for any breach of the treaty LC643FDJ86 whether the breach was committed by the Chief himself or his subjects, and the fines levied from the Chiefs were credited to Her Majesty's Government, and the Imperial Exchequer. The reason for the practice was that the British Gov ernment, which incurs all the expenses connected with the suppression of the slave trade, was entitled to any recoveries which might be made by way of penalty. / 204. In 1900 the Chief of Bahrein inflicted a fine of Rs. 100 on one of his External A„ s.pi em be, .500, No,. ^ fleets, who was proved to have reduced into slavery a person who had already received a manumission certificate from the British Consulate at Busrah. Mr. Gaskin asked for instructions as to the disposal of the fine and suggested that it should be paid to the Chief of Bahrein on condition that the money was not returned to the offending person. Colonel Kemball was of opinion that this suggestion might be acted upon, and that in similar cases this procedure should be followed as being likely to make the Chief more interested in the suppression of slavery. The proposal was submitted to the Secretary of State with the Government of India's recommendation (despatch to the Secretary of State, No. 122-ExternaI, dated 23rd August 1900). 205. The Secretary of State approved and extended the proposal to meet the External A., F.brnar, .901, No,, cases of fines imposed by other Chiefs of the Persian Gulf littoral (despatch No. 2-Political, dated 4th January igoo). 206. The Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury agreed to this ' subject on the condition as explained below :— ^ *' If they may assume that fines like that levied by the Sheikh of Bahrein are fines levied under local law by the local Chief on his own subjects, then on the understanding that no legislative or conventional objection exists, their Lordships assent to the proposed method of disposing of these fines. If, on the other hand, any slave trade fine is levied on a British subject under extra-territorial jurisdiction, the proceeds should be credited to the British Exchequer like any other fine levied under such jurisdiction.' 208. In September 1901 the Government of India left it to the discretion External a., October 1901, Nos. 13.14. of the Resident whether to hand over External a,, December uoi, Nos. 3-3 -a. or not to the Chief of Shargah a fine of Rs. 98 (70 reals) recovered by the Chief from one Ali bin Hoosein for having bought a slave-girl at Ras-el-Khima. (Foreign Department letter No. 1629-E A., dated a4th September 1901). v The Resident, however, did not think it expedient to return the fine to the Chief and credited the amount to Her Majesty 's Government. 208. In April 1902 a female slave, named Fedo, took refuge in the Bahrein External a., June 1902. No. ,0. agency. It was found that she had been imported by one Yusuf bin Mahomed, a resident of Katar, and left in charge of Sayar bin Mahomed for sale. The Chief inflicted a fine of^oo dollars to be paid in equal proportion by Yusuf and Sayar. The latter paid his portion, and gave bond promising to pay the other portion payable by Yusuf, in case he failed'to return within two months. The Resident credited the amount recovered to Government in the accounts of his office and proposed to deal similarly with the other fine when it would be recovered. (iv) Abduction of seven Africans from Melindi to Oman and steps taken to tra:e them and punish the culprits, 1892-1897. 209. On the 14th May 1892 the Political Agent, Ma skat, received infor mation that a party of seven Africans in company with an Arab had arrived at Mattrah from Melindi on the east coast of Africa. An enquiry was held, and though the Africans said they were free and the Arab produced passes gianted by officers of the Imperial British East Africa Company, there was strong sus picion that the Africans had been induced to come to Oman, either as slaves or with the object of eventually reducing them to slavery.87 2IO. This suspicion was confirmed when on the night of the wd Tune iSoa Mattrah^hp 8 eSCa! ' e f ^ 'j 16 . Consulate and the Arab disappeared from Mattrah the same night. The destination of the party had been Zaki, and there- fore it was supposed that they had fled there. The name of the Arab was Seit bin Khatir. It was discovered by reference to the Administrator, Imperial British East Atnca, that the owners of the slaves were Hamis bin Nasur and Seif bin baleimai^ wealthy Arabs of position, known to the British Superintendent of JVIelindi beif bin Suleiman originally came from Zaki and had relatives in the place. r nyr 21 ] 1, ^ n . 2 3 r ^ ] une *893, in the course of correspsndence with the Sultan of Maskat, His Highness stated that Hamis bin Nasur and Seif bin Suleiman, the alleged owners of the slaves, were in Oman.

However the Consul- ueneral in Zanzibar said in letter dated 18th June 1894-— ' 1 fear that, as far as this Agency is concerned, no further steps are likely to be of much use, but it will be for the Government of India to decide whether they wish me to take any; ' and to this we replied ** In view of the opinion expressed by you the Government of India must leave you to act or not upon the suggestion (that the property should be attached) as you think best. It is evident therefore that the property has not been attached.' 213. The evidence of Hamsini, father of one of the slaves, who had remained „ , „ t , A ... 0 v ^ at Melindi and was examined by Mr. Bell No. 70 of External a , Marcli 1895, Nos. 68-73. , • u i .i • , Smith, practically proved the case against Hamis bin Nasur, and this was confirmed by evidence of Rubayyah, a runaway slave taken by the Political Agent at Maskat. This evidence stated that four of the slaves were living with their masters at Zaki and three had been sold. One of the latter was dead. This evidence was taken on the 17th April 1895, and on it the Political Agent requested that the two men, Hamis bin Nasur and Seif bin Suleiman, be detained. The Political Agent was informed through the Agency Munshi that they were confined in Fort Merani. 214. In May 1896 on a reference from the Resident, the Government of ... q j. .* India passed the following orders :— External a., June 1896, Nos. 73-75. r &amp; u These two men have been detained for more than eleven months, and notwithstanding their detention, there appears no longer any hope of recovering the seven Africans, with whose sale into slavery they are supposed to have been concerned. In these circumstances it is considered that the further imprisonment of these men is unnecessary and you can inform His Highness the Sultan that they may be released. 215. The Sultan of Maskat also requested that the property of the two Arabs . . w „ „ „ at Melindi might be restored to them. This xter«a ay 1 97, 01.135-13 . request was referred to the Consul-General for such action as he thought fit. (v) Dismissal of the Coal Agent at Bassidore for possessing slaves, 1887. 216. There was at Bassidore an old coal agent, Haji Abbas by name, who in 1877 was found in possession of a num- Poiiticai A., July 1877, No«. 146 153. ^ slaves. The man being a Persian subject was not, in Lieutenant-Colonel Prideaux's opinion, liable to punishment, but having regard to the enormous sacrifices the British Government incurred for the suppression of slavery, it was incompatible with his position of British Gov ernment servant to hold slaves and thus encourage slavery. The Resident ther^-88 fore decided to dismiss him, and asked for the approval by Government of his view. I 217. ihe following was the view expressed by the Government of India No. 1517-P., dated Simla, 27lh June 1877. From— T. H.T hornton, Esq., D.C.L., C.S.I., Offg. Secy, to Government of India, Foreign Dept., To— L ieut .-C ol . W. F. P rideaux, H. B. M.' s Offg. Pol. Resdt., Persian Gulf. I have laid before His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General m Council youJr letter No. 64, dated 17th March 1877, in which you report the dismissal of Haji Abbas, the British Government Coail Agent at Bassidore, in consequence of its having been discovered that he is the possessor of several slaves, and solicit that the principles which ^ou have laid down in the case may receive the approval of the Government of India. 2. In reply, I am desired to state that His Excellency in Council fully approves of the general principles laid down by you, that it is the duty of officials of the british Govern ment to co-operate by every means in their power towards the total suppression of the slave-trade, and that any failure of duty in this respect must be visited with grave displea sure. But this undoubtedly sound principle must, I am to observe, be reasonably applied ; and its application to the case of a Persian subject employed in Persian territory in the capacity of coal agent on the ground of his being the possessor of domestic slaves appears to His Excellency in Council to be somewhat strained. 3. So far as His Excellency in Council is aware, the duty of a coal agent is to supply coal and not to regenerate society ; unless therefore there is any express stipulation in the contract with Haji Abbas, that he is not to be the owner of domestic slaves, it may be doubted whether his conduct, sanctioned as it is by the religion and law of Persia, is such as to warrant his summary dismissal and denunciation. 4. Under the above circumstances, the Government of India, while it appreciates the motives which have dictated your proceedings, is inclined to question both their justice and their expediency. (vi) Kidnapping of Baroda subjects proceeding against the offenders, 1900-or. 218. On the arrival of the mail S. S.

This proved to be the case on enquiry, and the children were found to have been kidnapped from Baroda. One was a girl about 18 years old, the second a boy about 13 years old and the third a baby, all belonging to the Bhanya caste. It was discovered that the Arab in possession of the children Salim bin Umr (an inhabitant of Mokulleh of the tribe of Deni), got possession of the children with the assistance ot some person or persons at Baroda when the country was devastated by famine. 219. The Arab was imprisoned by the Sultan and afterwards removed to External A., March 1901, Nos 32-41, Bombay where he was arrested under a . warrant from Baroda. He was tried at the latter place under section 363 of the Indian Penal Code, and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years. One Salim Abdullah, who was accused of having assisted the Arab in the matter, was acquitted, there bein^ no sumcient evidence against him. s (vii) Punishment of Jemadar Abdullah, the Ccmmander of Sultan of Maskat's forces at Lohar, for complicity in slave trade. 220.

At the earnest representation of the Political Agent, the Sultan investigated the charges against him and having become convinced of their truth, sentenced him to three months' imprisonment. This, it was hoped, would serve as a good lesson to slave-dealers on the batmen coast.89 appendix. Reports on Slave Trade in the Persian Gulf, 1852—1859. Report on the Slave Trade in the Persian Gulf extending from January i, 1852, to June 30,1858. I p Sla ^ ery r ha K at j 11 tIm f S ° ccu P ied m uch of the attention of the Residents in hi tht r™ and much through their efforts, supported as these have been ff t ^ e Govern j nei J t of Bombay and Her Majesty's Mission at Tehran, has been effected towards the attainment of our object, its abolition. Unfortunately however, it was m the power of the Government to spare vessels, either sufficient in number, or of the class that is needed, to uproot the inhuman traffic. 2. We purpose compiling a history of the slave trade in these tracts from the commencement of 1852 to the close of June 1858, and with a view to render our narrative more clear, we shall, after making a few preliminary remarks, divide our subject into three distinct parts, vis, :— Part I, The suggestions offered to Government by Captain Kemball, when Resident, for the better suppression of slavery, and the plans adopted by Government consequent on the above suggestions. Part II. The recommendations of Captain Felix Jones, successor to Captain Kemball, on slave trade and slave suppression generally, together with result of his recommendations. Ptrt III. —The fruit of our labours to put down slavery. 3. Prior to the 1st of January 1852, we possessed but two conventions for the repression of slave trade in the Persian Gulf—the one with a number of Indepen dent Arab Chiefs on Arab Coast, the other with His Highness the Imam of Maskat. These, too, limited our powers of search and seizure to the sea. In the case of the Imam, moreover, as pointed out by Captain Felix Jones on his arrival as Resident, and will be seen in the sequel was rectified by that officer, the terms of the convention were so defectively worded as to render its value merely nominal. With Persian and Turkish vessels we had no right to interfere. These could import or export slaves at their pleasure. Though crowded with human beings destined for the market, we could not lay our hands upon them. The year 1852 may therefore be hailed as an era in the history of slave trade in these parts. For, towards the close of the year i85t, an agreement was concluded by Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran with the Persian Government, authorising the seizure and temporary detention by British cruizers of Persian vessels engaged in the slave trade, and on the 1st of January 1852 this agree ment came into force. In 1847 the Sublime Porte issued firmans, empowering British ships of war to search vessels carrying the Turkish flag that were sus pected of being concerned in the iniquitous traffic. Here, then, looking upon the territories of the Maritime Arab Chiefs as independent States, we possess ed agreements with each of the four powers, whose subjects resided on the borders of these seas, and whose vessels notoriously carried on the slave trade. Granted the agreements, as existing at the commencement of 1852, conceded to us but very limited powers, and were highly unequal in their pressure. Still they were, one and all, a step in the right direction, and thanks to the support of the Government and Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran, coupled with the exertions of the Residents in the Gulf, still further advances were made towards the attainment of abolition of slavery, and were an organised system set on foot, and pertinaciously adhered to every season for a few years. P art I. 4. We proceed now to the consideration of Part I. We find the following statistics of the prosecution of the slave trade as • existing in these regions during the year 1852 c643Fn90 Captain Kemball, addressing Mr. Secretary Malet on the 27th of Tuly 1 852, the following abstract of human cargoes brought from Africa by the vessek pertaining to the Maritime Chiefs of Oman :— From Zanzibar to Ras-el-Khyma— Buglah of Bin Subeyt „ of Hussan bin Ramah ...

' ^ From the fact of their being in a manner smuggled ip f o the Turkish terrifnrv r cannot with any certainty arrive at the true number of slaves imported ; the greater portion thf^Fi 111 k f be,ng conveyed overland from Queit to Sookest Shinkh and o^her towns on he Euphrates for aisposal.^ Those intended for the Busrah market are generally secreted occurs 'for thel^saTe!' 0113 rUlnS W1 W ^ the t0Wn abOUndS ' 1111 a faVOrable 0 PP or tunit y ' From all the information I have been able to collect, which is but scanty and meagre consequent upon the unwillingness of my informants to enter into details, it appears to me that the Soor people, the Ahl-es-Suahel and some few of the Queit shipowners, are the importers, Queit being the entrepot for the slaves destined for these parts: and I am informed that the importations take effect in small coasting craft of so small a draught as to enable them totally to elude the vigilance of the Honourable Company's cruizers.' 11. From the above particulars it will be seen that notwithstanding our treaties for the suppression of slavery, notwithstanding the cruize of a vessel of war off the Batinah Coast, and other suspected localities, to intercept slavers in May and June 1852, slave trade was in its full vigour in that yean The alarming extent to which it was ascertained to be existing incited Captain Kemball who, together with his predecessor. Colonel Hennell, had ever been most earnest in his endeavours to repress the infamous traffic, to devote even more of his energies towards its extinguishment. 12. In May 1852, as already stated, a vessel was deputed on slave service, but, notwithstanding the exertions of her Commander, Lieutenant Tronson, but little resulted from her cruize. The cause that may probably be assigned to this vide Captain Kembaii's despatch to a. Maief failure is the plan adopted by slavers of fu?'' 8 :hief Secretar7 to Government, No. 45 of landing their living freights at intermediate Uyl S2, . depots, which conveniently abound on the coasts of Batinah and Oman for subsequent removal in small numbers at pleasure.' Moreover, as observed by Captain Kemball in his communication to Government of the 22nd May 1852, the Tigris, the vessel that was deputed, was deficient in equipment for slave duties, and little hopes of a harvest could be anticipated from her employment. 13. Presuming upon his local experience, the Resident submitted to Govern ment that the sympathies of the Chiefs and all Mahomedans in the Gulf lay entirely with a continuance of the slave traffic. No 'voluntary co-operation could therefore he looked for at their hands. On our own endeavours and exer tions alone must rest the hope of extinguishing slavery. Vide paragraph 3 of letter from Captain Suggested the advisability of 'adopt' Kemball to Mr. Secretary Malet, No. 85 of i n g measures tO CUt off the Supply from November 1852. . 0 . . . rr J its original source. Vide Captain Kembaii's despatch to Mr. He exhibited the inequality of action and Secretary Maiet, No. 46, under date July 28, pressure that existed among the several treaties and agreements in force in the Gulf. 14. In the case of the Maritime Arab Chiefs and of His Highness the Imam of Maskat we possessed the right to seize and confiscate vessels carrying92 on slavery. In the case of Persia we were only authorised to remove the slaves, infliction of punishment resting with the Persian authorites, and, finally, when dealing with vessels of the Ottoman Porte, the slaves only could we liberate, the slavers we must He put to the trouble of ' conducting to their destination.' The equipment necessary for ships to be employed on slave service was pointed out by Captain Kemball, and reference was made to suggestions pre viously submtted by Colonel Hennell regarding their location ' between certain limits.' 15. The continued importation of slaves into Persian ports, notwithstand ing the convention so lately concluded, was brought to the notice of Her Majesty's 0 . , . , Minister at Tehran, and resulted in the despatch from Colonel (now Sir Justin) Sneil ti.L n** to Captain Kembaii, dated December io , 1852, Ministers of the Persian Government submitted to Government by latter officer in his consenting tO avail themselves of the aid of communication No. 5 of January n, 1853. r» ui /-• &gt; 1 r the honourable Company s vessels or war in bringing to an account Chiefs of the ports into which slaves had been imported. 16. Such were the measures adopted by the Resident in 1853. The Bombay Government, on receiving intelligence of the appalling extent to which slavery was carried on in the Gulf, addressed the Commodore Commander-in- Chief of the Indian Navy, and, feeling most anxious to check the inhuman traffic, solicited his opinion as to the arrangements fitting to be made for the interception of slavers during the ensuing season. Sir Henry Leeke in reply fitie letter from Captain Sir h. j. leeke, r.n., stated that he considered the squadron ® tc ;' t0 J th® Honourable Lord viscount i n Persian Gulf should at the proper Falkland, dated October 7, 1852, forwarded to .

'Beyond the above it did not occur to him that anything could be done to suppress the slave trade which he was informed was carried on in small country vessels of such light draft of water as to admit of their passing up in shore out of sight of the men-of-war, however close they might hug the land, a In addition to this the officers commanding vessels in the Persian Gulf were much Vide Persian Gulf Selection No. XXIV, 1856, puzzled to know the slaves from the crew of the page 652— vessels, and the constant fear of having a heavy demurrage to pay lor false detention very natural- be entered on board as sailors and the difficulty of v deterred them from making a seizure, making the distinction unless the individuals would themselves come forward and assert their natural rights.' 17. These suggestions were approved of by Government, but, from the pre-occupation of the ships of war of the Indian Navy, it appears to have been found impracticable to spare in time the reinforcement required for slave service, and the vigilance necessary to stay slave dealings could not be exercised during the season 1853. I. his led Captain Kemball to report fresh importations of human cargoes into the ports of Oman, and to submit the necessity for more vessels. Captain Kemball wrote thus— 'Could an effective system of watch and cruize be maintained on the Zanzibar and Vide Captain Kemball's letter to Mr. Secretary Batinah coasts, I would confidently predict the Malet, No. 58 of July 20, 1853. entire cessation of the slave trade in the Persian Gulf in the course of two or three years. As yet the force annually employed on.this service has been limited to one small vessel, spared with difficulty, and for a limited period only, from the Gulf.' v J' 18. In August 1853 the Honourable Company's steam vessel Queen was de puted by Government to search for slaves, but had scarcely commenced her labours when she was recalled, being required for other purposes. No continued active measures could therefore be taken to repress slave trade, and the traffic Continued.15 93 t - J J v.

Vide enclosure to Mr. Secretary Malet's commu nication to Captain Kemball, No. 157 of I u I t 12, 1852. J 7 19. As regards the Persian ports, however, remonstrances from the Resident, Her Majesty 's Secretary of State for Foreign t ^ e ac rive CO -Operation of the Persian Slave Commissioners, supported by the presence of our vessels Qf war and by the material aid derived from Her Majesty's Mission at the Court of Persia, had been productive of much good. Numbers of t 1 . . 11, . slaves had been manumitted. Numbers of s ave importers had been punished. The I n am of Maskat, too, had paid a W'lhng deference o our appeals, and two of His Highness' vessels had been seized and sent to the Presidency for adjudication. But the ports of Oman from our inability to detach vessels at the proper season, and in sufficient numbers to intercept their boats, and from our inability to claim slaves when thny had been landed, were revelling and glorying in their impunity. 20. Captain Kemball brought his important fact prominently to the notice of Government m the month of January 1854, and earnestly begged that a remedv might be applied. ' He further expressed his opinion that ' a steamer cruizing principally under Vide Captain KembaU'i despatch No. 5 of Janu- sail in the latitude of Makullah between ary 12, 1845. the 15th March and 1st June, and attended by a small vessel to keep the offing (for which purpose a schooner or a brig might usually be detached from the Gulf squadron) would give such a blow to the slave trade as still prosecuted by the Arab tribes as would go far towards its entire sup pression, or, at least, remove all grounds of complaint on the score of impunity.' ' If the vessels stationed at Aden could be spared to cruize in the same latitude during the period named, it would, he thought, contribute much to the attainment of the object desired.' 21. The Bombay Government, on receipt of Resident's despatch, communi cated with the Political Agent at Aden, expressing its desire that 'Captain Kemball's suggestion should be complied with, if a vessel could be spared from Vide Mr. Secretary Anderson's letter No. 1090 that Station,' and again Wrote to the Com- Of March 13,1854. ^ mander-in-Chief, Indian Navy, with a view to his detaching a vessel on slave service. 22. The reply received from the Commander-in-Chief, Indian Navy, was forwarded by Government for the information of Captain Kemball, and its tenor was indeed discouraging. Vessels were again pre-occupied, and no reinforce ments could be spared for the repression of slave trade. Sir Henry Leeke's own words, when writing on the subject, were as follow:— ' I have not the means of strengthening the squadron either at Aden or in the Persian Gulf as represented in my letter No. 40^ of the 2gth Extract from a letter No, 437 of June 6, 1854, from Sir H. Leeke, R N., etc.', to the Right Honourable Lord Elphinstone, G.C.H., etc., etc. ultimo. ' If I had plenty of vessels at my command, there can scarcely be a doubt that the slave trade may be kept very much under, perhaps entirely abolished.' 23. Nothing further transpired until the month of July 1855, when the Com mander-in-Chief, Indian Navy, despatched the Honourable Company's steam vessel Queen to cruize between Ras-el-Had and Maskat there to remain until the 1st of September, when she would be relieved by the corvette Falkland, 24. Instructions were also issued to the Resident to detach at the proper despatch from Mr. Secretary Anderson to Season SUCh Vessels of the Persian Gulf Captain Kemball, No. 3500of August ao, 1855. squadron as could be spared without in convenience to the public service ' to cruise in localities where vessels with slaves were likely to be intercepted 35. Thus stood matters in the summer of 1855, and in the autumn of the same year an exchange of appointments having, under the sanction of the Home Authorities and the Government of India, been effected between the Resident at Bushire and the Political Agent at Baghdad, Captain Kemball in due course left for Baghdad, and Captain Felix Jones assumed charge of his new post at Bushire.

This transfer brings us then to Part H. * Captain Felix Jones had not been Ipng at his post ere an instruction reached Vide Mr. Secretary Anderson's despatch to Cap- him from Government, desiring him to tain Feiixjones i.N., No. 604, dated 21st Febra. devote his best attention to 3l sup^estion ary 1856, t olitical Department. r j 1. r t 111^-. - ot the Honourable the Court of Directors that endeavours should be made to obtain by agreement from the independent Arab Chiefs on Oman Coast the right to demand the surrender of slaves after they had been landed. This instruction had been forwarded by the Honourable Court consequent on a despatch to Government from Captain Kemball, dated 22nd of June 1855, pointing out our success in slave suppression on the Persian Coast, and the utter impunity enjoyed by the Chiefs and tribes on the Arabian Coast. . 2 7- Captain Felix Jones, shortly after the receipt of above communication having proceeded on a .tour of the Gulf ports, exerted himself to obtain a treaty of the nature desired from the Arab Chiefs. Details of the negotiations are unnecessary. Suffice it to say that, almost contrary to his own expectations he succeeded in inducing the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Maritime Chiefs of Oman tosubscnbe to a further convention in May 1856 for the suppression of slavery wtoeby we became empowered to demand and to enforce the release of slaves that had been landed in their territories. This, it must be admitted, was a errand accession to our powers and tender to narrow the field for slave traffic. It may be added that considering that the Arabs derive a great portion of their revenue from the buying and selling of slaves, that slaves are looked upon as essential to the comforts of their households, the concession thus gained was a victory more splendid than negotiation, unaccompanied by pressure or force, had any right to expect. Let us note, now, as briefly as may be, the results attendant on the signature of the new compact. 28. The compact had scarcely been subscribed to when an active British Agent at Shargah ascertained that slaves had been landed at Ras-el-Khyma and Amulgavine. He lost no tune in addressing himself to the Chiefs of the above ports, who at once acted up to their fresh engagement, thereby happily res cuing from slavery 40 human bemgs from Ras-el-Khyma, and seven from Amulgavme. Somewhat later in the year two were obtained from the Joasmee ChieT. 29. Such m 1856 were the liberations effected on the strength of the new Paragraph 2 of Captain Felix jores'despatch treat y&gt; and as Captain Felix Jones truly to Mr. Secretary Andcraon.

The instruction to despatch, if possible, a vessel to cruize in search of slaves, reached at a season when there were numerous obstacles to militate against its accomplishment. 41. Captain Felix Jones, earnest in his desire to strike a blow at slave traffic, was most anxious to detach a vessel on slave service, and had, prior to the Captain Felix Jones' despatch to Mr. sec- recei P t of Government instructions, ad- r p et r7 \^ rson : N °- 34. dated April 22 , ,856, dressed himself to the late Commodore roiiticai Uepartment.

We will take the case of the Amulgavme Chief for an example. 5 : Hajee Yacoob having learned that slaves had been landed in the above named Lhie s territories proceeded to Amulgavine to demand them. OwiW however, to the excuses and pretexts that were put forth, he found himself incap able ot obtaining their releasement. At that, juncture it so happened that Lieutenant Robinson visited Shargah with the Brigantine Tigris under his command, and having gathered from Hajee Yacoob that the Amulgavine Chief was making endeavours to evade fulfilment of his obligations, he at once took the Agent on board and repaired to Amulgavine to bring the Chief to a strict account. Fresh objections were raised, but eventually four slaves were surrender ed, three others, demand for whose releasement had in like manner been prose cuted, having in the interim died of cholera, 6. At Shargah, too, a number of slaves traced as having been imported were demanded by Hajee Yacoob, and his demand backed by Lieutenant Robinson, but Vide paragraph 2 of Political Resident's letter No. the Wily Joasmee having recourse tO a host 378 of October 1858, to Mr. Secretary Anderson. of prevarications, and having further ' COU- nived, it was supposed, at their escape from the town,' for a time our efforts to C643FD102 recover them proved unsuccessful. In the end, however, Hajee Yacoob, from being incessantly on their track, succeeded in discovering* them, and caused the Joasmee of March 8,1859, to Mr. Secretary Anderson. authorities to deliver them into his hands.

The above constitute the bulk of the seizures and surrenders. There remain cases of capture by the vessels of Her Majesty's Indian Naval Squadron. Before, however, entering on the details of these, we purpose placing on record a few observations submitted by Commodore Jenkins in respect to the human beings whose liberation we have just particularized, and disposing of a case rather delicate in its character that occurred at Bahrein Island. 8. Commodore Jenkins, whilst forwarding a report on the subject of slaves in the depot at Bassidore, remarked on the diversity of age of these unfortunates the range exhibiting extreme tenderness of years among the youngest and when we consider they were slaves destined for the market, a highly advanced stage of life among the oldest. 9. He tells us ' the slaves were of all ages, the youngest being about four No. 130 of November s, 1858. oldest about sixty.'

In another portion of the same despatch he writes—' it appears the Arabs trading from the Persian Gulf to Berbera and Zanzibar have during the last two years been more active and vicious in forcibly stealing African children and women than at any period and their conduct calls fer the serious consideration of our Government. * . * . * O ne of the female slaves made a most heart-rend ing appeal to me on my visiting the depot, soliciting that in mercy we would send her again to the port of Berbera, which is her country, and from which S ' 0l ' She stated her husband and young child were with her at Berbera : that the Arabs over-powered her suddenly and placed her in a boat, and made her their slave ; that she has heard much of the great power of the British Government and of our possessing Aden and therefore prays to be restored to her own people who will all appreciate the act, and as I feel that this poor exile's appeal will be so easily complied with and may prove very beneficial to our influence on her return to her native land, I beg to recommend it to your consideration and that of the Government, and that she should be sent from Bombay to Aden in the mail steamer, and from Aden to Berbera in a vessel of war. . IO ; l Tl i 1US wrote Commodore Jenkins. It is unnecessary to load the pase with details. It will be sufficient to say that ' the Senior Magistrate of Polife paragraph 4 of Mr. Secretary Anderson 's Bombay WaS instructed to Send the Pohtic N .rkeL^t, 5 pi;LnuS Felix J 0 ** '• N - Somali female slave to Aden, and the Poli- / j ri i „ ca ^ ^ esi dent of that station requested to forward her on to Berbera with all due precautions103 the earl'ier^par^of ou^narrative'' 5 '' 6 ^'' 0 ' 0f the CaSe at B ^in alluded to in of Commodore Jenkins, J wa^off the isiand'oTe 'j 6 i:iroad P endan t mg himself in one of her cutters that li u''' a I ave la . d c f&gt;nceal- the vessel and there remained secreted until a ren shoie . found his way to Disbrowe, the Assistant Resident at that t' P rese ' tatl( J n reached Lieutenant ,ad haVinS been mi;sed and ^ Z, h X-Z his^'restoration actually as represemeT.'an^lhiTtVe^ that ^ case was portation, conceived it to be his dutv as the dnnn f • recent im- m Bahrein waters when the lad set foit upon her d P edc Tnd wl ^ ^ niters, now an appeal had been made respecting him' to reauest L'' from Commodore Tenkine: Tfi^ • i , . rec l uest his surrender Who had fled to his flag'o olitaiil freedom^reverting To^Tol h ^ consentmg on the one hand to restore him to the Assistant Residenfsfa'te'd his rrL'V he 0 J her - 1 I' Ws own moment he stood on British ground or on the deckVa Brirish ^7 therefore the African in quesrion must have become free ' P 0f ^ and _ 14.

Captain Felix Jones on receipt of a report in detail of the affair express- H^ S M C0 - nC r i T en ^ e views adopted by his Assistant, and wrote at length to Her Majesty s Government of Bombay on the subject. He dwelled more particularly on the fact of our harbouring runaway slaves in instances like the present as being opposed both to the spirit and the letter of our treaties and likely besides to oe construed, that too with a shew of justice into an arbitrary mode of procedure on our part calculated rather to defeat than to advance our endeavours to suppress slavery. 16. In due course a reply was received accompanied by an opinion that had No. 4419 of December 21.1858. from Mr. Score- been recorded by His Britannic Majesty's 1^0^ 0 Capta ' n Fe ' ix J ones i wunendc^ure Advocate General at Bombay on the sub- . . ' . , . ject. The latter document being interest ing in its details, and giving moreover what appears to be a lucid solution of the point disputed, we subjoin it verbatim and entire. 17. Mr. Arthur J. Lewis, the learned Advocate, wrote thus :— rf I have read the correspondence relating to the demand for the surrender of the African slave who had escaped to, or taken refuge on board^ the Honourable Company's sloop of war Clive and I am of opinion that the view taken of the subject by the Assistant to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, concurred in by the Resident, is the correct view.

Opinions, however, vary on th s noin and we possess our doubts as to the conclusiveness of the Commodore's arguments. We doubt, too, without however intending in any way to detract one tittle from the activity displayed by Commodore Jenkins and his officers whether numbers of slaves did not elude the vigilance of our cruizers either by transhipment mto small craft that kept along the coast out of sight, or bv being landed to the south of the Commodore's cruizing ground, and marched over and to their destination or, last of all, by being sacrificed to the sordid teehngs of slave-owners and ship captains who, rather than see their vessels confiscated, consigned the unfortunate creatures to a watery grave The last contingency, with due deference to Captain Rigby, who considers Arabs are occa sionally guilty of such atrocities, we do not look upon as probable, at least as observed by the Resident, whilst remarking on Captain Rigby's expressed opinion, the best informed in this tract have never heard of such practices, revolting vide No. 66 of 1859, from Resident to Mr. as is the conduct of Oman slave -dealers Secretary Anderson, March 8, 1850. ^ ^ 1 1 • vv '. ^ p . . . . ln other respects towards their victims.^ £ l ITiay ' • rion * se ' lzur f slavers within the limits of the jurisdiction of the Political Resident at Bushire tends to shew more forcibly than ever that if we desire to uproot slave trade our severest blows must be struck* at the • Vide opinion to this effect.

In the month of October 1858 a most glaring instance of traffic in slaves took place at Bushire. The case was painful in the extreme, painful from the openness with which it was carried out, and painful from the barefaced denial of the fact by the Assistant Persian Slave Commissioner when the occur rence was brought home to him, and proved to him beyond a doubt. 20. The details of the affair are as follows :— ai. Three vessels from Shargah, a Joasmee port, passed under the bows of Her Majesty's steam frigate Punjaub in Bushire harbour, laden with a cargo of human beings to the number of about twenty. The slaves were landed and sold in the Bushire market. The fact was patent to every one. Nay, it was no torious that the Custom House officials in Bushire happening to have a dis agreement with the Commanders of the slave importing vessels on the subject of the duty leviable upon the human cargo, disturbances arose which led to the seizure, corporal punishment and imprisonment of one of the Commanders, nor was it till the latter had disbursed the sum of fifty-five tomans to Persian officials that he continued to obtain his release. These heart-rending occur rences were reported to the Persian slave authority by the Resident, coupled with bitter reproaches for such open dereliction of duty on his part in failing to seize the slaves in accordance with the spirit of his instructions. The reply of the Assistant Slave Commissioner was astounding. Though perhaps every child was cognisant of the fact, he was shameless enough to state that he had made careful inquiry, and ascertained that no slaves had been landed at Bushire. Disputes, it was true, he said, had arisen between the Custom House officials and the crews of the Joasmee vessels, but they were on matters distinct from slaves, and had led to the precipitate departure of the latter. Further than this he went so far as to upbraid us with neglect in not having caused a search of the suspected craft to be effected by the naval means at our disposal, this too notwithstanding that the Resident had already pointed out to him that he believed it was purely out of deference to him and Persian authorities ' spe cially nominated to act in affairs of slaves' that the Commander of Her Majesty's frigate in Bushire roads, who was fully aware of the presence of the slaves, had refrained from interference. In the hopes of precluding the recur rence of such painful scenes, Captain Felix Jones placed the correspondence that C643FD tio6 had passed between himself and the Persian slave authorities before the Senior vide paragraph i of Political Resident's letter to Naval Officer on the spot, and recjuested Commodore Jenkins, C.B, or in hi• absence Senior him tO ' adopt measures for the examina- Naval Officer, Bushire, forwarded to Gorernment • r i • .

Ihis search was 'to be effected only* however in the inner and outer roads.' He further expressed his desire to the Senior Naval Officer that ' in his proceedings relative to the search for slaves ' Paragraph 3 of ditto. in the immediate vicinity of Bushire, when the Resident could readily be communis cated with ' naval operations should extend to simple detention of, and strict surveillance over, all suspected vessels until a reference were made to him ' as Political authority. Such a course the Resident hoped would put an effectual check upon such barefaced attempts to carry on slave trade. The Resident, however, was doomed to be disappointed. The Senior Naval Officer at that time (Commander Foulerton) unfortunately represented his inability to carry into effect the proposed measures. His hands, he said, were effectually tied by an t This order i« dated 19th December 1840.
