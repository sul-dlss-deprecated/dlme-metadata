Khan, Esquire, M.A* LL.B., Advocate, High Court, EJLOJLA. To The Secretary to Government, Political Department, Bombay. Subject:- Petitio n fo r ^rant of pension . Sir, I am instructed by my client Bibi Shah Sultana daughter of the late Agha Farrukh Shah of Poona, to place the following facts, before you with a request that enquiries may be maxie into these facts, and the Government of India or tne Secretary of State of India in Council, my kindly be moved to expedite a decision in the matter of the petition presented by her mother to H. E. the Governor of Bombay and to H. E. Viceroy and Governor General of India (copies of which petitions are enclosed herewith for reference). Her father Agha Farrukh Shah belonged to the family of H.E. the Agha Khan and possessed great influence in Persia, owing to his family connections. The Great War broke out in 1914, and an expedition of the Germans, headed by one Capt. Niedmayer was organised in the autumn of the year 1914 and set out from Constantinople in December of that year with the object of spreading German influence in Mesopotamia, Persia, and Afghanistan. To counteract their influence and check their propaganda in Persia, Government of India were anxious to send some one in that country. Agha Farrukh Shah was selected as the right person for tne work, and offered his services loyally to Government, though he knew fully that he was endangering nis life, in doing so. He was given letters of introduction to tne various British Counsels in Persia, and he lelt India in June or • • oor July 1915. He went to Bushire and after staying there for some time went to Shiraz and &amp;B&amp;£hence to Kirraan, where he stayed for about a month or five weeks, with Lt. Col. Duckett, the British Counsel of the place, in October or November 1915. Other members of the family had been employed on tne same mission in various places in Persia, of whom one Agha Abdul Saraad, is deserving of mention. He was at that time at Bushire, and had given letters of introduction to Agha Farrukn Shan. In the meanwhile, a branch of Capt. Niedmayer’s expedition, nad separated from the main body of tne expedition and had arrived in Kirm&amp;n in July 1915 after touring various places like Isfahan ana Yezd and rousing the people against the British. It was doing propaganda work in Kiraan, and would have been successful in its nefarious object, xk had Agha Farrukh Shah not arrived there in October 1915. Messrs. Hodder and Stoughton have published a pamphlet entitled ’’German Intrigues in Persia”, which purports to be a translation of the diary of one Griesinger, a member of the aforesaid expedition, ana which throws considerable light on the situation. There is an entry in that diary for the 20th of the November 1915 whicn runs as follows ’’Farrukh Shah working at high pressure. Every one who comes * i says we should have him destroyed”. My client instructs me to submit that the above bears eloquent testimony to the excellent work done by him, and to the loyalty and courage with which he was discharging the duties entrusted to him. He continued to discharge his duties, in the spirit of devotion in which he had embarked on the mission, till the 7th of December 1915 when he was shot. The diary for that date mentions that fact in clear terms. Such was his influence in the locality that the British Counsel remained at Kirman unmolested during his life time, and on his death Lt.Col. Duckett left Kirman in the middle of December 1915 with Agha Farrukh Shah’s servant, whom he brought to Maseut, and thence sent to India. In August 1919 Agha Farrukh Shah’s widow submitted a petition ...petition to H.E. the Governor General of India praying for the grant of a pension to her. By Farrukh Shah's death, the allowance which H.H. the Agha Khan made to him ceased and his widow had to incur debts to maintain herself and her daughter. The mother and daughter had to incur debts to live in the state to which they had been accustomed in anticipation of the grant of a pension by Government. These expectations did not materialise, and the widow was informed that no pension could be given to her from the Indian revenues or the British Exchequer and that her petition had been forwarded to the Secretary of State for India in Council for perferring a claim on the Persian Government. The following letters were received by her from time to time on the subject and k ol are quoted for reference:- 9th July 1920 No. S.D.640 from Secretary Political Department. 18th January 1921. No. 214 V. -do- 29th August 1921 No.2060 W. -do- lj n- 29th March No.2555 -do- 2fcrd July 1925. No.852-C -do- After this tne correspondence on the subject ceased, and notning has been heard of in the matter. My client’s mother died some years ago and has left heavy debts which she had to incur, as stated above, and which my client is anxious to pay off. She has no means of support and is unable to earn her livelihood. I have therefore toreouest you, on her behalf, to kindly make * 's y - enquiries, and inform me as to what naa been dondxin the matter. If the Persian Government has refused to give compensation my client would like to approach His Majesty tne King Emperor and His Government with a prayer for pension, and has therefore instructed me to address this letter to you for information on the subject and she will be grateful to you if / will be pleased to let her know the result of the negotiations with the Persian Govt.
