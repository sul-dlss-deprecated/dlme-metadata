Kemball recommends that, because Humeed had moved from Gunna [Gurmah Island] to Katiffe [Al-Qaṭīf], no further actions should be taken for the present moment.The enclosures included with the letter are as follows:1. A letter (folio 44) from Lieutenant Alex Foulerton, Commanding Officer of the Honourable Company’s brigantine
                           Tigris, to Kemball, dated 14 July 1854, in with Foulerton writes that, upon his arrival at Gurmah Island, he discovered that Humeed bin Mujdell had removed to Al-Qaṭīf. Foulerton also comments he might have sailed closer to Gurmah Island had the area been better surveyed;2. Letter no.113 of 1854 (folio 45) from Commodore George Robinson, Commanding Officer Persian Gulf Squadron, to Foulerton, dated 4 July 1854, containing the original instructions for Foulerton to proceed to Gurmah Island to carry out requisition against Humeed bin Mujdell, though it is acknowledged by Robinson that Humeed may have since moved on to Al-Qaṭīf;3. A letter (folios 46-48) from Foulerton to Robinson, dated 16 July 1854. The letter is a detailed account of Foulerton’s cruise through the waters around Gurmah Island and Ras Boo Alli Island, north of Jubail.
