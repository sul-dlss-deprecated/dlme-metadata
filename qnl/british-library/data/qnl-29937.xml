C/28. Politic a! Agency &amp; H.B.M’a Consulate, ^scat, the 4th January, 1941. From Major T. Kickinbotham, O.B.E., Political Agent 4 H.B.M's Consul Muscat. The Hon'hle the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire Sir r 1 hare the honour to inform you that His Highness the Sultan has acquainted me with facts which have lead to a deterioration in the peaceful situation in the Dahirah and the action he has already taken to restore the situation together with his future intentions. General A geographical and topographical description of the Dahirah is given at page 427 Volume 2 of LorLmer’s Gaaetteer of the Persian Gulf. The area is inhabited by seml~independent tribes who acknowledge the Sultan of ?4i*cat and Oman as their overlord when it suits their convenience to do so but who usually consider them selves their own masters. Oaring the last two or three years partly in furtherance of his plan to establish effective control over the whole of his country and partly because this is the area in which Petroleum Concessions Limited, who hold an oil concession for the country, have been most interested, the present Sultan has made a sustained effort to Increase his political control in the area. That the Sultan*s efforts have been successful is borne out by the fact that in the winter of 1D38-39 geologists of Petroleum Concessions were able to travel in safety from Khaburi through Ibri - Yanqul - Jebel Hafit to Baraiml, and that many / influential2 « v ■X influential Sheikha have recently paid viaita to Muscat• Ibri and ita neighbourhood is particularly affected by the events to be narrated in this report. Ibri ia described at page 757 of the second volume of Loriaer and there is little to add except to say that it still maintains its evil reputation as the 'Thieves Market rt ( cO-V I ) • The present Sheikh is Abdullah bln Rashid Yakubi f a blind man who is credibly reported as being at the head of a thousand rifles. To the east of ibri is the town of Darla which is under the control of Sheikh All bln Said of the Beni Ghafir. Both these towns are marked on the maps published by the Survey of India but unfortunately the position of the large fort of ^inane is not. The fort which is garrisoned by All bin Said f 8 Beni Ghafir is the key to the Uadi al Hawasinah and the Korthern Dahirah. built It is said to be a stone^bulldlng of considerable strength situated in an open plain between Ibri and Darls f rather nearer to the latter town. Son. little time ago certain men from the Beni Kalben tribe «ho inhabit the Mishin - Maqaniyat ana murdered adherents of the Imam, toharaaad bin Abdullah al Khalili, near the town of Rest*'}. The Imam then called upon the Beni Kalban to hand over the murderers which they refused to do. He then threatened to enter their country and undertake operations against them whereupon representat- -- -—- -—- —• - ! They regard the Sultan as their overlord. The Sultan answered them evasively and promised nothing definite contenting himself with telling them to come to him again if it appeared that the Imam really intended to carry out his threat saying that he would then consider the matter. The Beni Kalban Sheikhs returned to their tribal area. Sixteen days ago the Imam sent forty men under his t representative Zahar bin Ghausn Hanai to Ibri. It is not clear if these people were invited to the town by Abdullah bin Rashid or if they were sent on the initiative of the Imam. It is probable that / they were3 B&gt; th«/ w«re not invited. Suffice it is to say that Abdullah bin Rashid was sufficiently impressed by the massage carried by Zahar bin Qhausn to hand over control of the area to him. The Imao^s men have been installed in a strong point and he is in virtual control of the town and very considerable '•Bait al Val ,, (crown lands) on which he will be able to raise by no means inconsidtrsble funds. The latest news indicates that Zahar bin Ghausn has left Ibri and returned to Niswa leaving a token force of only ten men in the town. The reason for this move is doubtful but it would seem that either he has been recalled or more probably that he has gone to make a personal report to the Imam on his mission and will return with a larger force. As soon as the control of Ibri passed to the Imam the Beni Kalban Sheikhs and the Hawasinah Sheikh, Saif bin Sultan, came to Muscat and interviewed the Sultan. The Beni Kalban were not given a definite promise but were told to discuss the situation with the Walij Mudhaffar bin Suleiman^ of Sohar wbo happened to be in 4uacat in connection with affairs at Dhibah. The Sultan after consultation with Judhaffar bin Suleiman sent Sheikh Saif bin Sultan al Hawasinah to Ainane to negotiate with All bin Said for the surrender of the fort* He has been instructed to promise Sheikh Ali bin Said that the Sultan will not Interfere with his 'crown lands’ at Jaris and will overlook their disagreement of last year and will be ,, kind‘ , to him* The extent of the 'kindness 11 is Tv an unknown quality and will not be a subject of negotiation aa Saif Dir. u.olz bean told that the fort must be surrendered at once ana bin oaid must trust to the Sultan's sense of fairness* If the fort is surrendered then the Hawasinah will hold it with a hundred men. The Wall* Hudhaffar bin Suleiman^ has now returned to ohar to sound the Dahirah Sheikhs and to organise them in prepared* ness lor the next move. He has been supplied by the Sultan with a certain amount of money and ammunition to assist him in improving relatione with some of the more distant tribes. He has been / ordered toordered to return to %ecat Inmedlately after the Id al Zuha on the 9th of this month to make a report on the situation to Baiyid Shahab bln Falsal 9 who Is acting as Regent In the Sultan's absence 9 and haa been further instructed to seek an interview with me in order to inform me of the latest events. 4. aattiUi latMtJLaaft* It is the Sultan’s intention to evict the Imam from Ibri and at least to restore the status quo of three weeks ago. To do this It is essential for him to obtain possssslon of the key to the position • the fort of Alnane. Should he be successful in obtaining the surrender to his men of Ainane he will at once strengthen the garrison with a Attach ment of regular troops with automatic weapons who will be moved from Bait-al-Falaj by way of the Batlnah road to Khaburah and then across country to Ghalsaln where camel or other pack transport will have to be made available for their onward journey through the Wadi al U&amp;waslnah. X understand from the Sultan that he has no fear of interruption to his line of communication through the Beni K&amp;lban and Hawaslnah country. Should the Sultan fall to obtain Alnane by diplomacy it will most probably fall into the hands of the Imam, whose move further north the Dolton will try to prevent by stirring up the trlb.. in the Uhank - Yanqul - FalaiJ B«nl Qitab area to oppoae him and to harass his left flank while he^completes his preparations for the assault on Alnane• 5. Imam's Intentions. It is very difficult to say with any dagree of certainty what the Imam has as his ultimate goal. It would seem that he has moved against Ibri (successfully) as the first move in an operation to acquire control of the western end of the Wadi Hawasinah which is essential if he really intends to take action against the Beni Kalban. At the same time he seems to be undertaking a very large venture to deal with what is really a tribal matter of no particular i importance and one which would normally be settled by tribal custom. / I believe his/ 7. Canoloalon I believe hie intentions to bo other than Just the punishment of a few tribal murderers* It is possible that he is making an attempt to extend his political influence to whole of the dahirah up to the Bar aim! Oasis which will put him in practical control of the Interesting oil country and will opan the Hatinah to tribal raids* £• toasittiita * the Sultan cannot afford to ignore the Imam's incursion into territory under his political control* It is a direct blow at his prestige and if the movement is continued will place the Sultan in a very awkward position having regard to hie agreement with Petroleum Concessions Limited* In addition the Imam will be a constant threat to the Batlnah with its rich date gardens and 0 coastal towns with their small but important British Indian trading communities* It is therefore essential for him to take action to restore the position* Be well realises that the allegiance of the Dahirah tribes with one or two exceptions such as the Al Bu Shamis bedouin and 9 the Alawi at Yanqul will go to the party which can produce the strongest and most effective force* If A inane falls into the Imam's hands the Sultan's task will be difficult* If A inane falls into the Sultan's hands the imam's position at Xbri will be untenable and he will have to choose between vacating Xbri and treating the matter as purely a tribal dispute to be settled by tribal custom) or raising his followers and undertaking a major operation against the Tultan* Should the Imam adopt the former course the Sultan will probably occupy Xbri ana hand over the administration to his representative at AJLnane who will probably be dudhaffai &gt; bin £.ul«*imen or lahmood bin fehansaad bin Turk!, «*ail of Birkah* It is probable that the Imam will adopt the former course as the latter might easily result in hie being forced by flanking movements to vacate ftiswa and retire to his property In the *adi £ assail where he would become virtually a prisoner as the Sultan already holds the eastern entrance while the western entrance is under tho control of Sheikh Hamaa bin Hamad ar Bawaihl, the Sultan’s Wall of ?u*annah.StttKittifcM' I have been fully informed of the course of events by the Sultan and have at his request discussed the situation with the Military Adviser* The Sultan is leaving for India today but will return should his presence be rendered necessary by develop* isents. In the meantime the conduct of affairs is in the hands of iudhaffar bin Suleiman at Sohar t who has the Sultan's confidence, and Saiyid Shahab bln Faisal, the Regent, who has not however been informed by His Highness of tils intentions. It is known that the Imam ia consulting Sheikh lea bln Saleh al Harthi and Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar of Jebel Akhdar and his further action will depend on the result of this conference. Sheikh Isa bin Saleh will not be favourably disposed to warlike operations and his considerable influence will be on the aide of peace. Should the Imam obtain the support necessary for his operation it will be sometime before there are any major develop* menta in the situation. It will take time to collect tribesmen and in the event of All bin Said not surrendering control of Ainane to the Sultan it will be at least a month to six weeks before the Imam la in a position to undertake an operations against All bin Said who will certainly resist to the best of his ability. The Hawaainah Sheikh will not reach Ainane until about the 17th of this month and I have no doubt much time will be wasted in confer* ence.

The latest reliable information up to the 16th January was to the effect that Zahar bin Ghausn had left Ibri with all his men, and had retired to the Southward. His move was prompted by the action of the Ghafiri tribes to the north and west of Ibri who, not looking with any pleasure on the Hinawi success there ; began to collect with the probable intention of taking active measures to turn him out. Minor sub-sections \ of the Ghafiri tribes are harrying Zahar bin Ghausn at the village of Sibele, where he has halted pending the arrival of the assistance which he has asked the Imam Mohammad bin Abdullah al Khalili to send.him. ainanb . No change. BENI KALBAN. Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar has asked the tribal leaders to come to him and has promised to use his good offices to effect a settlement. The Beni Kalban^while expressing gratitude for Suleiman’s offer^have said they would prefer him to come into their territory. OMAN GENERALLY. It is said that the Imam has appealed to Sheikh Isa bin Saleh Al Harthi to assist in solving the Ibri - Beni Kalban problem but that wily old gentleman has found it convenient to move eastward to answer an invitation from the Beni Bu Ali and the Beni Hassan of the Jaalan to adjudicate between them over their tribal differences. The Imam is said to have appesuled to Saqr bin Sultan of the Naim at Baraimi for assistance but his appeal has not been answered. It is rumoured that the Ghafiri tribes who have so up set the Imam’s plans have been encouraged by Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar himself who is of the Ghafiri section.A -v &gt;H© It is probable that if he fails to obtain assistance the Imam will appeal to an influential leader such as Sheikh Suleiman bin Sinan of Yankul or possibly even Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar himself to use his good offices to bring about a settlement. It is thought unlikely that the Imam will obtain any substantial assistance•Telegram From T E L E G HAM To No. Dated # - En Clair. - Political Agent, Muscat. - H.H. the Sultan of Muscat &amp; Oman, Karachi. - C/94.

Major, His Britannic Majesty*s Consul,Museat.On the night of 29th Dhulhaj we arrived at the outskirt of the village of Abri in obedience to the order of «ali Mudhfar, the Wall of oahar. We made enquiries about all informations concerning Dhahera - about the people of the Imam, the inhabitants and those who submitted to the Imam and those who did not. We returned with full particulars. Written by dhuwain bin Amer al Husaini. The fort of Abri has now been captured by Sahikh Muhammad bin dalim Ar Rac^shi. There are 30 other persons with him living there by the order of the Imam. Proclaimers proclaimed that rule of that place was that of the Imam. Abdullah bin Rashid Al Yaqubi has gone out of the fort with his son and they are now living in the village. They have no power there. f In the village of dallif, there is Shaikh Saber bin Ghusn al Hana living with 40 other persons of his tribe and 30 persons from the party of Ali bin Said kI-^^tthtI. The inhabitants ! have no influence there. $tcUal&gt; Darru' and Bani -^atb have renounced the sway and have submitted themselves to^party of the Imam. Originally there was nothing disagreeable from them. The inhabitants of Araq, Abri and the Baluchis have submitted to the order of the Imam. They are awaiting his arrival. Hamdan bin Naser Al Alwi has gone to the Imam. He has 16 men. It is not known what course he will adopt but it appears that he will also submit to the Imam. Bani Kalban was approached by Shaikh Hamdan bin ^a4-im Al Muameri who found them disobedient to the Imam. The Imam informed us that he would be proceeding to Dhahera with a great army on 27th Dhulhaj.T iLk-E-S.

Saiyid Ohahab considered that there was little doubt that Ibri and Caleef were in the hands of the Imam. He considered that the ‘Jali lAudhaffar’s information was not absolutely accurate and suspected the wall Mudhaffar of wishing to quarrel with the Iiaara. He said that he had received information similar* to that which I obtained from Shuin bin Amar and that he had further been recently informed that the Imam had collected an army of at least eight to ten thousand men at dahlah. He said that in his opinion this last item of information was a gross exaggeration as he could not for the life of him understand where the Imam could raise such a force and pay it, when it was known that Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al iiarthi had so far not taken any part in the Dahirah trouble. Even if Ainane was occupied by tae Imam, Saiyid Shahab did not consider that it was possible for the followers of the hhalili to hold the area they had at present acquired for more than a month to six weeks. He felt cure that the Imam’s Force would melt away as the prospects of pay ana loot dwindled. For his part he was not prepared to give one pie or one round of ammunition unless the Imam made a definite move into the Beni halban territory when it would be necessary, firstly, to endeavour by persuasion to settle the trouble between the Beni kalban and the Imam and, secondly, should persuasion fail to take steps to prevent the Imam from obtaining or as the case may be retaining a foothold in the Beni Kalban territory.* 1 pCopy in translation of a letter dated the 1st Muharram from Mudhaffar bin Suleiman, Wali of Sohar,to H.B.M’s Consul, Muscat.

It is rumoured that the Imam has disbanded his force at Bahlah on an undertaking having been given by Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar to be responsible for the conduct of the Ghafiri tribes. Saiyid Shahab has suggested to the Adviser that it would be a good thing to hold a training camp at Adhaba, and it is probable that certain of the Bait-al-Falaj troops will move out for further training within a week. Saiyid Shahab's idea is that the purpose for which the troops are going to Adhaba should not be announced and that the Imam should thereby find himself in some doubt about the exact t reason for this move. Adhaba is where the *adi C a nail track leaves the coast and is about fifteen miles from here. HTelegram - En Clair.

From Major T.Hickinbotham, O.B.E., Political Agent A H.B.M's Consul Muscat. To The Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B.. U „s g L -iL. Ji* Sir I have the honour to refer to my printed letter No. C/66 dated the 21st January, 1941, and to enclose copies of two notes of mine on recent interviews that I have had with the Regent. The present situation in the Dahirah is that the Imam has 2 effective control of Ibri and has Installed Mohammad bin Salim al Raqeshi as his Governor. Zahar bin Ghausn has composed his differ ences with the local tribes at Saleef (wrongly called Sibele in my printed letter under reference) and seems to be content to remain there for the time being. The fort of Ainane is still in the hands of its owner, Sheikh Ali bin Said, the Sultan having failed to obtain possession of it by diplomacy and the Imam having made no attempt to do so by force. The Beni Kalban are still refusing to come to terms with the Imam. The Imam himself is at Bahlah where he was reported to have gathered together a large force but it is now said that he has disbanded his army on Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar's guaranteeing the quiescence of the Ghafiri tribes. 3. The Sultan is in Bombay and, even should he desire to, will probably not be able to return to Muscat for at least a month owing to transport difficulties. I am keeping him fully Informed of the situation by telegram and he has so far not given any indi- cation of his re-action to the Imam's partial success. He was expecting to meet me in Karachi at the beginning of this month but / unfortunately--N 2 unfortunately I have not been able to get there yet and it will not now be possible for me to discuss the situation with him before the middle of the month. The Sultan may wait until he has had an opportunity of talking things over or he may initiate a counter by telegram. It will probably be the former course that he will decide upon. 4* The Regent who is taking matters very calmly has a very low opinion of the Omani. He says, with considerable truth, that he will do anything for money and that the pendulum will swing right over should the Sultan show any inclination to make monetary presents. The Regent never believed the stories about the Iman^s great army as he said the tribesmen would only come for what they could get and would disperse as soon as they discovered that there was little prospect of financial gain. He considers that the Imam’s Governor of Ibri will find himself in difficulties in the near future as the tribes in the neighbourhood are a care free lot and if the governor attempts to enforce the Shara Law, as appears to be his intention, they will soon become restive and the Imam will have to choose between maintaining his position by bribery or force or withdrawing within his original limits and allowing the people of Ibri to continue their, from the Mutawa’s point of view, reprehen sible ways. 5* In order to increase the Imam’s difficulties until the Sultan’s intentions are known the Regent has, like many other leaders in times of crises, decided to hold array mavoeuvres. During the course of next few days a substantial part of the Muscat Force will move to the small village of Adhaba which is fifteen miles from here and is the starting point from the coast for the Wadi Sonail. The Wadi Samail is very important strategically to the Imam and he cannot view with equanimity the possibility of the Sultan making a thrust in that direction while he is himself involved with the .j ahirah tribes so that this training camp may have the effect of / inducing himinducing him to abandon Ibri and return to Nizwa particularly as Sheikh lea bin Saleh al Harthi has so far shown no enthusiasm for his manoeuvres in the Dahirah* The Imam’s position is not a happy one and he now seems to have decided to rest content with the occupation of Ibri. So far he has made no move in the direction of the Beni Kalban country and it is possible that he is hoping for the an-ival of Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harthi as a mediator. It will be interesting to see what, if any, re-action in Oman is caused by the troops move to Adhaba. I will inform you of the Sultan’s intentions by cable after seeing him in Bombay unless he decides on earlier action when I will communicate with you immediately.

For his part he was not prepared to give one pie or one round of ammunition unless the Imam made a definite move into the Beni Aalban ter: itory whan it would be necessary, firstly, to endeavour by persuasion to settle the trouble between the Beni halban and the Xa*tf&amp; and, secondly, should persuasion fail to take steps to prevent the Imam from obtaining or as the case may be retaining a foothold in the Beni K?ilban territory. r *Extract from a note on an interview with Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal, Minister for External Affairs, Muscat, on February 5th, 1941, at 10 a.m. at the Consulate. rt l. Saiyid Shahab said that he had received letters from the Wall of Sohar which had been addressed to Haradan bin Saliym by Zahar bin Ghausn and A1 Be^eshi to the effect that the Imam has control of Ibri and that A1 Rekesni has been appointed Wali oil behalf of the Imam. Further, that the situation is calm and that in future the law of the Shara will govern Ibri. Saiyid Shahab has also heard that the Beni Kalban^still recalcitrant and are prepared to resist by force any attempt on the part of the Imam to enter their country. It is rumoured that the Imam has disbanded his force at Bahlah on an undertaking having been given by Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar to be responsible for the conduct of the Ghafiri tribes. Saiyid Shahab has suggested to the Adviser that it would be a good thing to hold a training camp at Adhaba, and it is probable that certain of the Bait-al-Falaj troops will move out for further training within a week. Saiyid Shahab's idea is that the purpose for which the troops are going to Adhaba should not be announced and that the Imam should thereby find himself in some doubt about the exact reason for this move. Adhaba is where the Wadi Samail track leaves the coast and is about fifteen miles from here.”•v* / / # ■S' I i Note on an interview with the Minister for External Affairs, Muscat, at his office at 10-15 a.m. on February 20th, 1941. A long and friendly interview of little importance. The situation in Ibri is much the same. It is rumoured that the son of Abu Zaid will be Wall of Ibri shortly replacing A1 Raqeshi. There is evidence to show that while the sons of Ali bin Shahail and Ghausn bin Naser were at Sohar soliciting assistance their fathers were with the Imam at Bahlah. 2. Saiyid Shahab reported that he had received information of a slaving case at Fujairah. The details are contained in ray telegram of the 20th February (No. C/194) to.the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. iThe Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to Hia Majesty’s Secretary of State for Indie , Indie Office&gt; Icndcn.

No.C/66 datedI am enclosing a letter which the Sultan asked me to give to you. He discussed various matters relating to Military and Defence matters and I am setting forth briefly his wishes in regard to them. Any time that you are free I shall be very glad to discuss fully a point on which you may require more precise information on His Highness's views 2. Dahlrah,. The Sultan does not propose to take any .action until he returns which will be at the beginning of next month unless the Imam precipitates a crisis by occupying the Beni Kalban country or endeavouring to extend his influence northward. dhen His Highness returns he will approach the subject of the Imam's incursion through Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harthi. / \ Major A.O.C. Military 3. Muscat Town Defences . The Sultan wishes you to examine the new and any proposed works on the town walls and to prepare, in con junction with the State Engineer, an estimate of the cost of such alterations as you may consider desirable from a defence point of view. 4. Launch and .Vireless . His Highness sanctions any expenditure that may be necessary before he returns to Muscat. Such expendi ture will be met from Muscat State Funds. On his return / the Sultan Pettyfer, I.A., Adviser to His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and Omanthe Sultan will discuss the question with you with a view to arriving at an approximate figure to cover expenditure under these heads and decide how the money is to be found. 5. Rifles . The thirty rifles which the Sultan asked you to indent for are required for Dhofar as replacements for old weapons and to increase the armament of modern weapons as the difficulty of obtaining supplies of Martini Henry ammunition has reduced the effectiveness of his Dhofar armament. If you can find thirty rifles from your reserve without unduly weakening that reserve then he is prepared to withdraw his request for additional weapons from India. 6. Jemadar Mir Baz . In view of the unsettled position in the Dahirah the Sultan is not prepared to approve the grant of leave to Jemadar Mir Baz until he has had an opportunity of discussing the situation with you. 7. Saiyid Tarik bin Taimur . The Sultan has decided that Saiyid Tarik should receive pay etc. according to the work that he is doing and that the expenditure will be met from your budget. Should you consiaer him equivalent to a Jemadar or a Hawaldar he will \ receive the pay etc. of that rank. These emoluments will not be considered in any way to constitute an increase in any allowance which His Highness's half brother is at present in receipt of and will cease on his ceasing to be employed with the Muscat Infantry. 8. Military Budget Surplus . The surplus from last year is at your disposal. You should draw what sums are necessary by debit on the Treasury and the Sultan will reconcile the amount on his return. As / your surplus / ! \ / ' \—*— 'V \ \ your surplus was from the War Subsidy of wn^ch the Treasury Officer is unaware and of which he must remain in ignorance it has therefore not been shown in the State Budget for 1941.4 CONFIDENTIAL.

To The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain. Sir, /P’ I have the honour to refer to my letter No. C/161, dated the 8th February, 1941, and to our conversation at the Secretariat, New Delhi on Monday March the 4th when I made a verbal report on my interview with the Sultan on March 1st in Bombay. 2. There has been no radical change in the situation in the Ibri area since the report contained in my letter under reference. The Sultan has received a communication from Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harthi acquainting him with the Imam’s move to Ibri and stating that the action was taken in response to an invitation from Abdullah bin Rashid al Yakubi who informed the Imam that he was afraid of his son taking control and saying that if the Imam was reluctant to aid him then he would be forced to seek the protection of Ibn Saud. Sheikh Isa bin Saleh seems also to have hinted that the Sultan had evinced little interest in the area and made no attempt to preserve law and order in a notoriously lawless district Sheikh Isa's letter, as is usual in his communications, contains a great deal of truth used to the best advantage to give a plausible reason for the Imam's action. The Sultan is as adept as Sheikh Is at this form of communication and will not find the letter hard to answer• 3 . The Sultan has no intention of permitting the Imam to remain in possession of Ibri but he does not intend to take any action until he returns to Muscat early next month unless the Imam endeavours to enlarge his present sphere of influence. On hisret u rn lie will answer Slieikli Isa bin Saleb’s letter and I gathei will declare his strong disapproval of the Iman^s action and suggest that Sheikh Isa advises him to withdraw pointing out that Abdullah bin Rashid al Yakubi should have been advised by the Imam on Receipt of his letter to apply to his overlord,the Sultan for assistance. The Sultan will probably add that he proposes to take such action as may be necessary to ensure that the control of Ibri ana the surrounding district is such that there will be a cessation of lawlessness. I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant f f 1 Major, Political Agent &amp; H.B.M*s Consul, Muscat. « tCONFIDENTIAL.

Saiyid Shahab informed me May 6th that Ali bin Said of Ainane in consequence of pressure by the Imam had made a written request for assistance and a verbal offer to surrender Ainane on terms to the Sultan. Shahab replied that he should surrender Ainane and that they would discuss terms. If he agrees tribal force from Sohar will occupy fort and possibly permanent garrison will be sent later from here. I am in agreement with action taken by Shahab. 2. A clash has occurred between the Daruiiand their neighbours near Saleef. There have been a few casualties.TELEGRAM. Telegram From To No. Dated - 'S' - Political Agent, Muscat. - Political Resident, Bushire. - C/350. - May 6th, 1941. H I discussed political situation with Saiyid Shahab May 6th and the following are my views of the present position 2. There are no operating enemy agents in Muscat terri tory at present. They would encounter little difficulty in entering from the west. The most receptive areas for propa- ganda backed with money would be the Beni Bu Ali behind Sur and the Shihuh. While the possibility of an approach to the Imam must not be overlooked it would be more difficult and more expensive but if successful more dangerous. Isa bin Saleh al Harthi is the Imam's main stay and he is a man of intelligence who would not be persuaded easily to take offensive action. 3. Ismail Rasassi Governor of Matrah and the favourite of the Sultan is a Palestinian advanturer. He is unscrupulous and though he finds it convenient at present to be pro-British he could be suborned without difficulty. He is unpopular locally. 4. Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim Minister for Internal Affairs would like to embroil the Sultan with the Imam for his personal gain. He covets Rustaq and once in possession would prove more of a danger than the Imam is now. He is in debt and would be susceptible to financial influence. 5. The advent of enemy agents in possession of ample funds would probably be known in time to take adequate measures to safe-guard British interests.T Telegram From To No. Dated TEL EG R A M. - l »S M - Political Resident, Bushire. - Political Agent, Muscat. - 396. - May 7 th, 1941.
