[35934] No. 1. SECOND MEMORANDUM OF HIS BRI TANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT RESPECTING THE CLAIM OF MESSRS. [The marginal references are to the German text of the Second German Memorandum.] HIS Majesty’s Government have had under careful consideration the memorandum drawn up by the German Government relating to the occurrences on the island of Abu Musa, which was forwarded by the German Ambassador on the 4th December, 1909. In view of the nature of the arguments and evidence contained in that memo- © randum, it has been found necessary to cause further enquiries to be made in the Persian Gulf, and, although every effort has been made to avoid unnecessary delay, it has been found impossible to prepare the observations of His Majesty’s Govern ment upon such arguments and evidence at an earlier date. For convenience of exposition, the conclusions arrived at by the German Government, as sum marised on pages 27-29 of their memorandum, are set forth each under a separate heading and printed in italics ; the observations of His Majesty’s Government upon such conclusions, and upon the arguments and evidence by which they are sup ported in the body of the memorandum, are sub joined in ordinary type. Copies of all documents referred to, except such as have already appeared in previous communications, are annexed in the appendix. His Majesty’s Government desire first to offer a few preliminary remarks on some of the facts which are enumerated on page 3 of the memorandum of the German Government as not being disputed. SECRETARY’S N2 51 COPY TO i*'niA 22 DEC 1911 ROBERT WONCKHAUS AND CO. IN CONNECTION WITH THE SHIPMENT OF RED OXIDE FROM ABU MUSAHis Majesty’s Government agree that Sheikh p- *• Sagar was prevented by the British resident from driving Sheikh Salim out of Abu Musa by force. There is no doubt that Sheikh Sagar, supported as he was by all the tribesmen, was in a position to treat Sheikh Salim, who had no means of defend ing himself, in any way he pleased, and it was only because Sheikh Sagar loyally submitted to the warniim of the British resident that there O must be no breach of the maritime truce that Sheikh Salim was allowed tojrema in in Abu Musa Island at all, and that arrangements were made for his maintenance. His Majesty’s Government would observe that P- *• Abdul Latif, father of Esa, was not the British “ consular agent,” but Residency agent. With regard to the statement that “ the rent P- was paid regularly, and received by Sheikh Salim,” His Majesty’s Government would point out that the German Government have omitted all reference to Sheikh Sagar’s statement that, on being informed by Sheikh Salim of the concession that he, acting as Regent, had granted, he voluntarily set aside the amount of the rent, as forming part of the revenue of Abu Musa, for Sheikh Salim, in order to make up his allowance to the original sum of 600 dollars, or more (see Appendix 5 to First British Memorandum). His Majesty’s Government would also point out P- *• that the statement that the share of Sheikh Sagar was on the 10th October, 1907, sold by Hassan Samieh to Thomas Brown is somewhat misleading, if unaccompanied by any reference to the fact that such sale took place eight months after the cancellation of the concession by Sheikh Sagar, and a week after the delivery of the final order that all work was to cease. His Majesty’s Government cannot agree that p. 4. the summary of the terms of the contract between Hassan Samieh and Herr Robert W / bnckhaus is accurate, and would refer to the terms of such contract as set out in Annex 5 to the First German Memorandum. Similar observations apply to the summary of Sheikh Sagar’s letter of the 21st Febiuary, 1907, to Hassan Samieh (Annex 12 to First German Memorandum).3 i p- With reference to the statement that Sheikh Sagar on the 3rd October, 1907, again ordered that the work should cease, His Majesty’s Govern ment would suggest the addition of the words “ and that he should remove his coolies and gear within ten days.” Similarly after the words “Thereupon, about the 20th October, 1907,” the words “ Hassan having taken no notice of this warning ’ should be inserted to render the state ment complete. p. 5. His Majesty’s Government are unable to concur in the account given by the German Government of the attempted landing on Aba Musa by two employes of the firm of Robert Wdnckhaus and Co. The facts of the case are that Mr. Brown and several employes of Robert Wonckhaus and Co., who, His Majesty’s Government contend, had no right on the island at all, attempted to land, and persistently ignored warnings that were given. Finally, as they disregarded all friendly attempts to deter them from landing, a few shots were fired over their heads (Appendix 28 \ Mr. Brown has never made any complaint to the Residency or the subject. His Majesty’s Government now proceed to the consideration of the conclusions arrived at by the German Government. I. pp. 27, 28. (a.) Sheikh Salim is owner of the island of Abu Musa; (b.) and therefore, according to the commercial law 'prevailing on the Persian Gulf, had a right to lease the oxide mines there to the mining company, Hassan-ibn-Ali and Co., in his own name. According to the Moham medan religious law he coidd not conclude the lease agreement ; according to that law, however, the company woidd have acquired the exclusive right to the produce of the mines simply by the fact of working them. It will be convenient to consider the above statements under two heads (a) and (6). (a.) Before considering the new arguments and pp. 5, 6. evidence put forward, His Majesty’s Government would point out that the allegation contained in the Second German Memorandum that the Britishmemorandum is inaccurate in stating that Sagar granted to Salim the revenue of the island, in cluding that derived from the mines, is not warranted by the facts ; nor is it accurate to say, as the German memorandum does, that “ Sakar in his own account oidy speaks of having assigned to Salim the amount of the rent of the oxide mines.” Sheikh Sagar’s statement was as follows : “ Seeing that Sheikh Salim had ceased not to complain that the sum of 400 dollars was not sufficient for his subsistence, I voluntarily set aside the amount of this rent for him, that it might make up his subsistence, so that the total of what came in to him yearly might be 600 dollars as before, and over, and that no cause of soreness might be left to him on account of the paucity of his allowance. I have absolutely not given him any deed in con nection with the island nor in regard to the mines therein ; all 1 did was to relinquish the income to him in the way of financial assistance from me to him, and it was done voluntarily and at my own discretion ” (First British Memorandum, Appen dix a). The words “ I have absolutely not given him any deed In connection with the island nor in regard to the mines therein” show clearly that the word “ income '’ which follows refers not only to the income from the mines, but to the whole income derived from the island. And Sheikh Salim states: “\ou were kind enough to place the island of Abu Musa under my supervision, so that I might cultivate therein and reap from it the means of subsistence(First British Memo randum, Appendix 1). There can be no doubt that Sheikh Sugar permitted Salim to enjoy all revenue that might accrue from the island. In practice the only substantial revenue was derived from the oxide mines ; the other sources of income mentioned in the Second German Memorandum will be discussed later. The question at issue being whether the island of Abu Musa is the property of Sheikh Salim or of Sheikh Sagar in his capacity as Sheikh of Shargah, His Majesty’s Government brought forward as evidence in support of their contention declarations by both the suggested claimants, each of whom stated in the clearest possible wav that the island is the property of Sheikh Sagar (First British Memorandum, Appendices 1 and 5) Evidence of so cogent and convincing a nature5 can seldom, if ever, have been brought forward in a case where the title to land was in question, and His Maj sty’s Government can only express their surprise that the German Government P- 6 * should decline to accept such evidence. The objections suggested to such evidence seem to be as follows :— 1. The statements were made by interested parties. 2. They were made while the case was in pro gress and steps were being taken to collect evidence. —- 3. Major Cox was at Shargah at the time when they were mode 4. They are out of harmony with the former attitude of the two sheikhs. 1. It may be conceded that the statement of Sheikh Sagar (the date of which should obviously be, as suggested in the Second German Memo randum, 1908 instead of 1898) is open to the objection which may be taken to the evidence given by any claimant in support of his own case. But how it can be suggested that Sheikh Salim is “interested’’ in disproving his alleged title to the island His Majesty’s Government are entirely unable to understand. The effect of the cancella tion of the contract by Sheikh Sagar has been that Sheikh Salim has lost a considerable portion of his income, and the suggestion that the latter would be ready to give false evidence in support of the contention that Sagar had a right to take the step which has had such unfortunate results for Salim is one which cannot be maintained for a moment. The statement of Sheikh Salim’s (to which he still absolutely adheres) is a declaration entirely against his interest, and is conclusive. 2. His Majesty’s Government agree that these statements were made after the question of the ownership of the island had been raised, and when evidence on the point was being collected. His Majesty’s Government do not attach much weight to this objection, which would apply with at least equal force to much of the evidence contained in the annexes to the Second German Memorandum ; they would remark that there would obviously be no reason for making such statements (especially that of Sheikh Salim) before the question of title had arisen. 3. If this objection means that His Britannic Majesty’s Resident, with the object of strengthen- [2294/—2] C6 ing the case, deliberately induced the two sheikhs to make statements which he and they knew to be untrue, His Majesty’s Government cannot entertain any such suggestion. 4. This point will be discussed later. His Majesty’s Government also produced, as further evidence of Sheikh Sagar’s ownership of the island, two letters written by him in 1884 to the British resident (First British Memorandum, Appendices 3 and 4). It cannot of course be disputed that these letters were written long before the question of title had arisen, but the German Government deny that they can be relied p. on as evidence of Sagar’s ownership. His Majesty’s Government are unable to accept P- the German Government’s account of the circum stances under which these letters were written. These circumstances have been explained above. At the time of Salim’s deposition Sagar had all the tribesmen at his back, while Salim had no follow ing at all ; the only question was whether Sagar should forcibly remove Salim from the island, which coarse would involve a breach of the mari time truce. Sagar informed the British Resident on the 17th May, 1 883, that he proposed to adopt this course, and was informed in reply that in order to avoid a breach of the truce he ought to arrange a peaceable settlement (First British Memorandum, Appendix 6). This was accord- done ; but had not Sagar been anxious to comply with the wishes of the British Resident there can be no doubt that Salim would have been forcibly and permanently removed from the island, in which case no question as to his title to it could ever have arisen. As it was, however, an agreement was arrived at, and Salim, who at the time of his deposition was at Abu Musa, was permitted by his successor to reside there. The agreement, however, did not work satisfactorily. Under these circumstances Sagar writes to the British resident to the effect that three courses are open: (a) that Salim should give a guarantee that he will do nothing to disturb the maritime truce ; (b) that the British Government should remove him from the island ; (c) that the British Government should stand aside while Sagar dealt with Salim as he thought fit. In both letters he states7 clearly that the island is his property as Sheikh of Shargah. His Majesty’s Government cannot accept the contention of the German Govern ment that all Sagar claimed was that Abu Musa P- was “ politically a dependency of Shargah.” There would be no object in Sagar’s making such a statement to the Resident, who was well acquainted with the fact, and such an inter pretation would render the letters meaning less, as there was never a suggestion of Salim’s setting up an independent state in Abu Musa. The meaning of the letters is clearly that if Salim is to be allowed to live on the island, instead of being forcibly ejected, his occupation must be distinctly understood to be without prejudice to Sagar’s rights as owner, and the peace must be kept. His Majesty’s Government would remark, with reference to the use of the words “I,” “we,” “ my,” “ our,” in the above letters, that in the original Arabic the plural forms are used throughout. His Majesty’s Government are also unable to p. e. accept the contention of the German Government that when Sagar uses the words “ our ” or “ my island ” the meaning is “ the island belongs politically to the territory of Shargah,” while the same words in the mouth of Salim mean “ the island is my private property.” The cases in which Salim uses the words “ my ” or “ our island ” are considered below, but it may be remarked that in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government no evidence of ownership can be derived from the use of such words by an occupier ; every man who pays rent for the house he lives in speaks of it as “ my house,” but that does not mean that he is the owner. With regard to Sheikh Sagar’s letter of the 11th October, 1902 (First British Memorandum, Appendix 7), the German Government remark : p. 7 . “ In order to understand the letter, it would be interesting to know the purport of Kemball’s enquiry, to which Sakar’s letter was an answer, and which is not printed in the memorandum.” The letter from Colonel Kemball referred to was in the following terms :— “ A report has reached me that you wish to grant a concession to Haji Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh for excavating and exporting red oxidefrom the island of Sir Abu Nuair. I have there fore the honour to inform you that it would be advisable for you to let me see the draft of the concession before concluding the arrangements. “ I shall also be glad if you will let me see a copy of the concession granted to Haji Nakhoda Ali for working the red oxide mines on the island of Abu Musa.” It will thus be seen that the arguments based by the German Government on conjectures as to PP* the words used by Colonel Kemball fall to the ground. Colonel Kern ball’s only object was to offer advice to the sheikh (as it was his duty to do) as to the terms of any concession he might propose to grant. This was the more necessary as Nakhoda Ali was a person of doubtful character (see Appendix 9). The sheikh replies that Colonel Kemball was mistaken in supposing that Nakhoda Ali was one of the concessionnaires, and states quite accurately the circumstances of the grant, including the fact that Salim made it as Regent. His Majesty’s Government are unable to agree with the German Government that “ it cannot P- 8. be inferred from this letter that Salim was actiiiii' only as Regent ” ; the fact is stated in the plainest terms, and strong corroboration is derived from the phrase used in Esa’s letter to Sheikh Sagar dated the 20th February, 1907 (Appen dix 27) “the lease which I and two partners acquired from the Government of Shargali relating to the extraction of red oxide from your island of Abu Musa. ’ With regard to the suggestion that the statement that Salim cultivates in the island p. 8. implies that he was the owner of it, H'S Majesty’s Government would only remark that if this contention is correct every tenant is the owner of the land he holds. No inference can be drawn from the quotation from the Administration p. 7 Report on the Persian Gulf, which appears to be based on incomplete information. The locality of the mines is not stated, and the erroneous state ment is made that Nakhoda Ali was the lessee, while it is expressly stated that further enquiry will be made. M ith regard to the statement alleged to have been made on the 28th November, 1907, by p . 8 . Sagar on the subject of the treaty of 1892, the account of the conversation which the sheikh gave to His Majesty’s Government soon after it took place does not tally with that contained in9 the Second German Memorandum, and His Majesty’s Government cannot accept the latter as accurate. As the German Government are no doubt aware, and as will be shown later, the dragoman Mirza Hussein has now been shown to be a person on whose statements no reliance can be placed; further, he could not speak Arabic, and the interpreter was Abdullah-bin-Hassan-Samieh, Hassan Samieh’s son, a person who was interested in putting such a statement into the sheikh’s mouth. P- 8. His Majesty’s Government are disposed to agree that the meaning of the sentence in the sheikh’s letter “ and the lease has remained up till now ” is probably that Sagar acquiesced in the conces sion when he returned from Mecca, as is stated by both the sheikhs (First British Memorandum, Appendices 1 and 5). At the time the letter was written nothing had occurred to make Sagar con sider the cancellation of the concession advisable. His Majesty’s Government cannot agree that Sagar’s statement that he voluntaril}- assigned the rent of 250 French reals to Salim is “an ex parte statement for which there is no proof”; it is evidence of the best kind, and is supported by Salim’s statement, “ When I leased the mines of Abu Musa I was officiating on your behalf, and the concession was given by proxy for you' (First British Memorandum, Appendix 1), which shows clearly that Salim would not have received the rent from the mines if it had not been granted him by Sagar. r i he alleged facts with which the statement is said to be inconsistent are considered below. His Majesty’s Government would point out that the phrase “ the amount previously promised or to a little over that amount ” is an incorrect reproduction of Sagar’s words; the Arabic is “wa ziyadeh,” i.e., “ and over ” or “ and more.” p. 9 The suggestion made by the German Govern ment that Sheikh Sagar’s right to pasturage on Abu Musa may be merely a servitude to wffiich the private property in the island is subject is entirely unsupported by evidence, and is not borne out by Major Cox’s report (First British Memorandum, Appendix 6;, to which reierence is made). [2294/—2] D pp. 8, 9. p. 9. p. 8.10 The German Government enquire why, under P 9. the arrangement of 1884, the revenue of Sir Abu Nuair was given to Salim to increase his pension, and not that of Abu Musa, which would have been more convenient, as he resided in the island. The suggestion is that the revenue of Abu Musa already belonged to Salim as owner. The answer is that it would have been useless to give Salim the revenue of Abu Musa, because at that time the island produced no revenue at all. This is shown by an extract from a letter written on the 14th October, 1880, to the British agent by the Residency agent, who, speaking of Abu Musa, says : “ Its water has altogether become salt, and the trees have died away. He ” (the Sheikh of Shargah, then Sheikh Salim) “ does not get anything from the place, not even a ‘ gaz ’ ” (a small copper coin). It is now proposed to consider the fresh evidence adduced by the German Government in support of the contention that Sheikh Salim is the owner of Abu Musa. It is asserted that “ Salim has always exercised P* the right to wreckage on Abu Musa.” His Majesty’s Government are not concerned to enquire whether the statement made is adequately supported by the citation of two cases in which pp. 9, 35. such a right has been claimed, because, even assuming the statement to be correct, it furnishes no evidence whatever of the ownership of Salim. The right to wreckage, or jetsam and flotsam, is exercised in the Persian Gulf by the inhabitants of the place where the wreckage is cast up, and if the ruling chief comes to hear of it he is entitled to a share, which he exacts or not as he sees fit. In the case of Abu Musa the right to wreckage was exercised not by Salim alone, but by him in conjunction with the other inhabitants of the island, so that any argument in favour of Salim’s ownership, based on the right to wreckage, would be an equally good argument in favour of the ownership of all the inhabitants. In support of this statement the following documents are adduced :— Letter dated the 17th May, 1894, from the Residency agent, Shargah, to the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, relating to the stranding of a Bahrein boat on Abu Musa (Appendix 1). Replies to above, 22nd June, 1894 ( Appendix 2).11 V Letter dated the 14th April, 1907, from the Residency agent, Shargah, to the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, relating to the stranding of the British Indian Steam Navigation Company’s steam-ship “ Bulimba ” on Abu Musa (Appen dix 3). These letters show clearly («) that it was “ the islanders,” and not Salim alone, who claimed the right to wreckage ; (b) that it was the Sheikh of Shargah whose position and responsibility in the matter were recognised. On the general question of the incidence of the right to wreckage, and the position and practice in regard thereto, the following evidence is sub mitted :— Letter dated the 1st March, 1895, from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Assistant Resident, Bunder Abbas (Appendix 4). Statement by Sheikh Sagar, dated the 25th March, 1911 (Appendix 5). Questions put to, and replies received from, the following sheikhs and notables of the coast:— Muhammad-bin-Tahnoon, agent of the Sultan of Muscat at Lingah (Appendix 6). Sheikh Saleh-bin-Muhammad-el-Ali, Chief of Charak. Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Abdullah-el-Hamadi, Chief of Merbakh and Mugam, of the Arab tribe of Hammadi. Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Muhammad-el-Ali, Headman of Keis Island, of the Sunni Arab tribe of A1 Ali. Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Majed-el-Marzooki, Head man of Bustaneh, of the Sunni Arab tribe of Marzuk. Sheikh Khalfan-bin-Misbah-el-Ali, Headman of Dourvan, of the Sunni Arab tribe of A1 Ali. Sheikh Sultan-bin-Ahmed-Marzooki, Chief of Moghu, of the tribe of Marzuk. Sheikh Abdullah - bin-Muhammad-el-Abei deli, Chief of Armeki and Cheeroe, of the Sunni Arab tribe of Obaidli. Sheikh Ibrahim-bin-Abdullah-el-Hamadi, Chief of Kelat, of the Hammadi tribe. Haji Ali-bin-Abdullah, a well-known merchant of Keis. Haji Isa-bin-Saleh, a well-known and reliable merchant of Keis.12 Haji Muhammad - bin - Hydar, a well-known merchant of Keis. Haji Isa - bin - Hussein - Janam, a well-known merchant of Keis. Muhammad-bin-Ahmed, a well-known merchant and notable of Keis. Ali-bin-Muhammad-Abdul- Wahid-el - Marzooki, a notable of Bustaneh. Haji-Abdullah-bin-Ali-el-Marzooki, a notable of Hasineh. Sheikh Hassan - bin - Abdul - Rahim. Chief of Hasineh. Ali-bin -Abdullah-bin- Muhammad-el - Marzooki, a notable of Hasineh. Haji Muhammad-bin-Hassan-el-Meithoomi-el- Marz &gt;oki, a leading merchant of Bustaneh. (Appendices 7 and 8.) The effect of this overwhelming body of evidence is to show clearly that the right to wreckage is exercised by the inhabitants of the locality, subject to the right of the chief to claim a share if he sees jfit to do so. No evidence ol Salim’s ownership ^can therefore be deduced from the fact of his exercising such a right ; if Salim claimed and exercised the chief's right to a share, it would be by virtue ol Sheikh Sagar’s permitting him to occupy the island, and any income which he derived from such a source would form part of the revenue of the island, which he was permitted by the sheikh to enjoy 7 . It may also be remarked, with reference to the terms of Salim’s letter of the 23rd March, 1898 (Second German Memorandum, p. 21 Annex 6), that at that time Salim was actino' as . &amp; Regent, and probably wrote the letter in that capacity. The German Government next refer to a version pp- 9, 10. of the oxide agreement (Second German Memo- PP- 35-37, randum, Annex 7), dated the 6th April, 1898, which was cancelled four days later, and for which another agreement (Second German Memorandum, Annex 8) was substituted. This first agreement contained the words “ So lung as I, my children, and my brothers live, no one shall have a right to raise objections to it.” These words were omitted from the second agreement, and it is suggested that the use of such words clearly shows that Salim was the owner of the island. The position is thus as follows :— An agreement is drawn up. r ♦ jr13 p. 10. It is immediately cancelled, and a fresh one substituted. Certain expressions which appear in the first agreement are not found in the second. His Majesty’s Government consider that the irresistible inference to be drawn from such facts is that the omitted expressions were objected to as inaccurate or misleading, and that for that reason the agreement v/as cancelled. His Majesty’s Government are in a position to show that such was the case. Abdul Latif has explained (Ap pendix 9) that the original agreement was drafted by Abdullah-bin-Hassan Samieh, and was shown by him to Abdul Latif, who at once objected (a) to the use of the expression now under discussion ; (6) to the inclusion of Nakhoda Ali as a signatory. The draft was accordingly cancelled and a fresh agreement drawn up, in which the objectionable expressions were omitted. The original draft was never seen by Sheikh Sagar until it was shown to him a short time ao*o O (Appendix 5 . So far, then, from the use of the expressions referred to being evidence of Salim’s ownership, their omission from the second agreement is strong evidence against it. Reference is also made to the clause in the second agreement providing for a payment for the trade in “mother-of-pearl and canary-seed.’’* It is suggested that this is “ inconsistent with Sheikh Sagar’s statement that he had granted to Salim only the rent of the oxide mines.” It has been pointed out above that Sheikh Sagar has never made the statement attributed to him ; what he did say was that he had granted to Salim the revenue of the island, which of course included this payment in connection with ovsters. Nor can any inference be drawn from the fact that the agreement under which Sagar became a partner provided that he should be responsible for a proportional part of this payment. The syndicate derived their rights from the document of the 10th April, 1898, under which both the annual rent and this special payment were secured, and any person entering the syndicate * It may be observed that the Arabic word translated “ canary-seed ” more probably refers to a kind of oyster. [2294/—2] E14 would of course be as responsible for his share of the second as of the first. Sheikh Sagar, ing assigned the revenue from this source to Salim, naturally, on becoming a partner in the syndicate, had to pay his proportion of it to him ; but it is impossible to conclude from that fact that Salim p. 10. had a right to the enjoyment in his own name of all sources of profit to be derived from Abu Musa, and that he could exercise this right even as ngainst the ruling sheikh.” He had the right because it had been granted to him by the ruling sheikh, and when the ruling sheikh became a partner in a syndicate which was under contract to pay rent, which rent had been granted to Salim, he was of course bound, in his capacity as such partner, to pay to Salim his proportion of such rent. Even if the rent had been payable to himself, his share of it would of course have been debited to him in the partnership books. The object of the insertion of the clause in question was no doubt to make it clear that the liabilities of the other partners were proportionately reduced. The German Government also rely on the fact P p. 10 , 37 that on the 26th December, 1898, Salim granted a lease of the mica deposits on the island. The fact is not disputed; it is clear that the lease was granted after Sheikh Sagar had relinquished to Salim the revenue of the island, and it appears from Sagar’s statement (Appendix 5) that Salim consulted him about it, and that in pursuance of his declared policy he allowed Salim to keep any payments made on account of the mica as part of the revenue derived from the island. Sagar would no doubt welcome any arrangements which would increase Salim’s income and prevent his making applications for money. Little attention has been paid to this transaction, because it was soon discovered that no mica existed on the island, and the concession accordingly became a dead letter. When Sagar wrote his letter of the 22nd February, 1908, he had no doubt, as he states (Appendix 5), forgotten all about this concession, granted ten years before, and long since abandoned. The draft memorandum of association sent by Abdul Latif to Hassan Samieh on the 6th January, 1899, will be considered later. The fact that Salim stipulated in the mica lease p. 11. that only keshkeshuh trees should be cut is no evidence of his ownership. He was admittedly in occupation of the island, and was therefore15 entitled to see that acts of waste were not com mitted thereon. With reference to the letter dated the 12th November, 1898, from Abdul Latif to Hassan Samieh (Annex 15 to Second German Memo randum), in which reference is made to a dispute between the two sheikhs about the island of Sir, the position (which, indeed, is obvious) is explained by Abdul Latif (Appendix 10). Under the 1884 agreement between Sagar and Salim (see Appendix 6, First British Memorandum) the revenue of Sir was assigned to Salim. The island, however, failed to produce any revenue, and in the 1889 agreement (see Appendix 6, First British Memorandum), no mention was made of it, the revenue of Abu Musa being subsequently transferred to Salim in its place. When the possibility arose in 1898 of Sir pro ducing some revenue, Salim put in a claim to it under the agreement of 1884, to which Sagar not unnaturally replied that the 1884 agreement had been superseded by that of 1889, in which Sir was not mentioned. Thus arose the dispute referred to. Abdul Latif was naturally unwilling to conclude the Sir agreement until the dispute had been adjusted ; he would have no hesitation about Abu Musa, not because he knew that Salim owned it, but because he was well aware that Sheikh Sagar Avas allowing him to enjoy its revenue. p. 11. Finally, the German Government state that the opinion prevailing among the most respectable natives is that Abu Musa is the private property of Sheikh Salim. In support of this assertion there are quoted the opinions of three merchants of Lingah, two of whom are also stated to have asserted verbally that everyone who has any knowledge of affairs on the Arabian coast is of the same opinion. His Majesty's Government regret that they are unable to attach the slightest weight to the opinions of the persons in question. Abdalmuhsin-ibn-Ahmed Almushari is a petty trader of Bahrein origin. He earns a precarious livelihood by speculating in pearls with borrowed money. Abdarrahman-ibn-Muhammed-ibn-Kazim is a16 Persian of Bastak. It is true that he was at one time French consular agent at Lingah, but in 1909 he was dismissed by the French consul, who had had occasion to complain of him. In 1907 he was proceeded against by the Customs for smuggling a large quantity of tobacco, and he has recently been complained against for unlawfully flying the French flag on a dhow. Hamd-ibn-Khalifa Al’uyuni was a petty mer chant, but went bankrupt, and afterwards endeavoured to make a living as a news-writer by writing gossip to various notables in the Gulf, and getting occasional presents from them. He recently died insolvent. As against testimony of this nature, His Majesty’s Government bring forward the evidence of nineteen sheikhs, merchants, and notables of the Persian Gulf, who are familiar with the affairs of the district. The names of these persons have been given above, and their statements aie set out in Appendices G, 7, and 8. They state that the owner of Abu Musa is the Sheikh of Shargah, now Sheikh Sagar. His Majesty’s Government agree that Salim, p. 11. with the consent of Sheikh Sagar, exercised (from the date of the arrangement made after the grant of the oxide concession) the full right of disposal of the usufruct of the island. This right was de rived from the permission granted to him by the owner, Sheikh Sagar. It is denied that he exercisea the right “as against Sagar, except in so far as the latter, while a partner in the syndicate, was responsible for the payment of his proportion of the rent. Finally, His Majesty’s Government would enquiie how it is suggested that Salim obtained his title to the island. His right to it as Sheikh of Shargah was lost when he was deposed ; and if the contention is that he had any other title there should be in existence documents of title oi othei evidence showing whence it was derived. No such evidence has been produced. Having thus examined the objections raised to the evidence brought forward in support of Sheikh17 * X Sagar’s title, as Sheikh of Shargah, to the property in the island, and having considered the farther evidence and arguments adduced in favour of the claim made on behalf of Sheikh Salim (though not endorsed by him), His Majesty’s Government a,re compelled to adhere to their conclusion that Sheikh Sagar is the owner of Abu Musa. pp. 27, 28. (b.) Salim not being the owner of Abu Musa, and the revenue of the island not having been transferred to him at the time of the grant of the concession, he had no right, either according to commercial or Mahommedan or any other system of law, to grant a lease of the oxide mines, except in his capacity as Regent. The lease having been acquiesced in by Sheikh Sagar when he returned and took up the reins of government, he succeeded to the position occupied by Salim with regard to the agreement, except that he allowed Salim to receive the rent as part of the revenue of Abu Musa. The question of the validity of the lease will be more conveniently discussed under the next head. IL P 28. The owner of the island, whoever he may be, has no authority, either according to the lease agreement (which is to be judged by com mercial laiu^, or according to religious law, to revoke or terminate the rights of the mining company or to hinder the company in any other way from working the mines. p. 12. His Majesty’s Government are unable to accept the contention of the German Government that Sheikh Sagar had no right to terminate the agreement. Quite apart from the terms of the concession, he had, as ruling sheikh, absolute power to cancel it at any time be thought fit. If this were not so, the words used by Salim, in his capacity of Regent, in the agreement of the 10th April, 1898, “ Should I at any former date have made any contracts they are not valid, only this contract, which is written in two identical copies, holds good ” (First German Memorandum, Annex 2) would be meaningless, and any previous contracts [2*294/—2] F18 would be valid as against the present concession- naires. His Majesty’s Government maintain that Sheikh Sagar’s right to determine any concession granted in his dominions (a right which would exist even if the island were the private pro perty of Salim) could not legally he questioned, and, indeed, this is admitted by the statement on p. 14 of the Second German Memorandum that “ the reigning Sheikh of Shargah is the absolute ruler of his country.” If by a high-handed and unfair use of this right the concessionnaires, who at the time of the cancellation were all British subjects, had suffered loss, they could only obtain redress by an appeal to their Govern ment, in which case the matter would he solely one between the sheikh and Idis Majesty’s Government. This being the case, it is unnecessary to discuss further the meaning of the terms in the agree- ment. His Majesty’s Government find it difficult p. It. to decide what was the reason for omitting the time limit of twenty years in the second agree ment, as the meaning of Abdul Latif’s statement (Appendix 9 ) that he “ saw no object in inserting any fixed period of time ” is not clear ; but they would remark that if the effect of the agreement really was that the lessees were entitled to put an end to the lease at any time, while the lessor was bound to allow them to work the mines in per petuity, should they so desire, in return for a rent of 201. per annum, the arrangement was most inequitable. For the same reason His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that the case is not one to which the principles of either the commercial or religious law can usefully be applied. But as the German Government produce evidence of this nature on which they rely in support of their contention that the lease was valid and could not be cancelled, it is proposed to deal with the point. The German Government produce opinions PP- 18 » 14, given by “ the leading merchants at Lingah and 42 ~ 46, Bussorah,” who state that the lease is good and19 valid, and cannot be terminated without the consent of the lessees. His Majesty’s Government are unable to agree as to the weight to be attached to the opinion of these merchants; their reasons for considering that no importance can be attached to the opinions of Hamd-ibn-Khalifa Al’uyuni, Abdarrahman-ibn- Muhammed-ibn-Kazim, and Abdalmuhsin-ibn- Ahmed-ibn-Mushari have been explained above. W ith regard to the other merchants whose opinions are quoted, His Majesty's Government cannot from the information at their disposal accept the description of them given in the P- 27. German Memorandum.. Abdullah Muhammed Hassan-al-Khodja is a member of a family which is ill-disposed to the authorities, and his testi mony is open to suspicion. Abdullah-ibn-Hassan- Kalladari is a close friend of Hassan Samieh, and P- 44. agent of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. The signatories of the document which appears as j Annex 24, are Turkish subjects from Bussorah. whose views on such a matter are of little weight, and as they erroneously state that the “agree ment was concluded in the land of Persia,” their opinions appear to be founded on a wrong assumption. In refutation of this evidence the opinions are submitted of ten representative merchants from different parts of the littoral (Appendix 11), who are unanimously of opinion that the lease is void, because it lacks both the specification of period and the pronunciation of the legal formula of proposal and acceptance, which are essential features of such documents. pp. 14, With regard to the contention that by religious 4 5 ^ law surface mines are the common property of all Mahommedans, and that an indefeasible right is acquired by the mere fact of working them, His Majesty's Government are somewhat surprised that such an argument should be seriously put forward at the present day. It may be that the clergy of Islam continue in theory to support this ancient tenet, but it is a matter of common know ledge that it is now entirely disregarded, and no attempt could possibly be made to give effect to it in practice.20 His Majesty’s Government would remark, with reference to the opinions of the clergy submitted by the German Government, that it will be seen that several of them, on their attention being called to the grounds on which His Majesty s Government contend that the lease is invalid, declared that such a contention was correct. His Majesty’s Government submit a body of evidence from distinguished members of the clergy (Ap pendices 12, 13, and 14), including the chief priests of Lingah and Bushire, both Sunni and Shiah. The effect of this evidence is to show clearly : — 1. That the lease was invalid for several specific reasons : (a.) The failure to insert the usual formula of proposal and acceptance. (b.) The failure to specify the period of the lease. (c.) The failure to specify the amount of profit to be derived by the lessee (Appendix 12). 2. That the lessor is therefore entitled to cancel the lease and eject the lessee (Appendices 13 and 14). His Majesty’s Government are therefore of opinion — 1. That Sheikh Sagar had, as ruling sheikh, an inherent right to cancel the concession, if he saw fit to do so ; 2. That if the principles of either commercial or religious law are to be applied to the case, the lease was invalid, and could therefore be annulled. The German Government are mistaken in pp. h, 15. stating that “The British memorandum further remarks that the principal object of Sagar was to administer justice as between the partners of the company on the strength of his ‘ sovereign rights of jurisdiction.’ ” The statement made in the First British Memorandum (p. 26) was “ The principal motive of the Sheikh of Shargah in cancelling, in accordance with the exercise of his sovereign rights of jurisdiction, the lease granted in his behalf by the Regent in 1898 was evidently21 % p. 15. p. 28. p. 21. a proper and natural desire to administer justice as between the partners of the company . . . .” The contention of His Majesty’s Government is, and always has been, that the sovereign rights of jurisdiction of the Sheikh of Shargah gave him the right to cancel the concession. The word jurisdiction was not meant to imply judicial jurisdiction, but the right of government. The questions therefore whether the sheikh “ had authority to decide as judge the dispute between the partners of the mining company,” “ whether the decision arrived at was justified by law,” and “ whether he had power to cancel the lease at his discretion in the interest of the administration of country ” are strictly irrelevant. In view of the careful consideration, however, given in the Second German Memorandum to these points, they will be dealt with in their proper place. III. (a.) Hassan Samaih had authority, as manager of the mining company, to conclude agreements like that with Mr. Wonckhaus, signing in the name of the company, without consulting the other partners. Such agreements at once became binding on the other partners ; (b.) in the case under consideration, however, their approval icas also signified. This point will be conveniently considered under two heads, (a) and (b). {a.) The German Government argue that the wide dispersal of the partners rendered it necessary that one of the partners should have authority to act for the others. His Majesty’s Government agree that it is not unlikely that such an arrange ment would be made as regards the ordinary incidents of business, although there is nothing to show that such an arrangement was made, or, if it was, that Hassan Samieh was the partner selected to act on behalf of the others ; but the question now at issue is whether Hassan Samieh had authority, without consulting his partners, to conclude an agreement such as the present, which disposed of practically the whole output of the mines, at a fixed price, for four years, with an option of renewal, and limited the annual output of the mines to a maximum of 5,000 tons and the further small amount which was allowed to go to [2294/—2] G22 India. Such an agreement was entirely outside the ordinary incidents of the partnership business, and it would require strong evidence to show that Hassan was in a position to enter into it without the knowledge or consent of his associates, especially as there was no need to carry matters through in a hurry, and the short delay necessary to enable the other partners to he consulted would not have prejudiced the conclusion of the agice ment, provided that they had raised no objection. The principal evidence on which the German p. 21. Government rely consists of an unsigned document P p. 39, 40. (Annex 14 to Second German Memorandum), purporting to be a memorandum ot association between the lessees, the first clause ot v Inch is alleged to give power to Hassan Samieh to con clude sales on behalf of the partnership. This document is said to have been drawn up by Abdul p. 21. Latif, and sent by him in a letter dated the 6th January, 1899 (Annex 13 to Second German pp. 38, 39. Memorandum), to Hassan Samieh, with a request that all the partners at Lingah should sign. It is further alleged that the document was signed p. 21. by Hassan Samieh, Abdullah, and Nakhoda Ali, who added a clause providing for the purchase of boats, and returned the document to Abdul Latif. On the 21st January, 1899, Abdul Latif wrote a letter to Hassan Samieh (Annex 40 to Second PP- 56, 57. German Memorandum), in which he objected to pp. 21, 22. the purchase of boats. Hassan Samieh then replied agreeing to the cancellation of the boats, and thereupon the arrangement is said to have become operative. No evidence, except Abdul Latifs two letters, is produced in support of the statements made. It appears from Abdul Latif’s second letter that when Hassan Samieh and his partners at Lingah returned the document to Abdul Latif with the additional clause about the boats they made certain other suggestions in a covering letter. Abdul Latif objected to these suggestions as well as to the provision about the boats, and there is no ground for alleging that the arrange ment became operative merely because Hassan agreed to waive the provision about boats. It is not suggested by the German Government that the memorandum was ever signed by the other partners, Sh-ikh Sagar, Esa-bin-Abdul Latif, and Mr. Malcolm, who, as stated on p. 12 of the Second German Memorandum, was a partner in the company, but who had entered it, not “ two23 V! &gt; fv? years after the conclusion of the lease agreement,” but on the 27th December, 1898 (see Appendix 16). It is hardly necessary to remark that no such document could be binding on the partnership unless signed by all the partners, and that there fore the document is valueless. The mere fact that clause 6 of the memorandum, to which Abdul Latif objected, and which Hassan Samieh, p. 21. according to the Second German Memorandum, was willing to cancel, was never struck out, but appears in the document as now produced, shows conclusivelv that the memorandum was never • i completed or executed, and consequently never came into operation. This is also shown by the fact that no accounts have ever been rendered to the partners who were not at the mines (see Appendix 17), whereas under clause 9 of the alleged memorandum this had to be done every four months. A further statement by Abdul Latif is annexed (Appendix 15) which shows clearly what occurred After Abdul Latif’s letter of the 21st January, 1899, objecting to several of the suggested pro visions, the matter dropped. The document was never completed or signed by the remaining partners, and was never even shown to Sheikh Sagar. It has never been seen by Nejef (Appen dix 22). Mr. Malcolm states (see Appendix 17) that, to the best of his belief, he never saw or heard of the so-called memorandum, and certainly never signed it. In any event, even if the document were taken as being in force, there is nothing in its terms which would justify hiassan in entering into contracts, other than ordinary sales, with out consulting his partners. The contract with Wonckhaus cannot be regarded as an ordinary sale, because (apart from the small shipments to India) it prevented the sale of oxide to any other person, and because, in effect, it would necessarily have limited the output to the amount taken by Wonckhaus and the purchasers in India. This document, then, having never come into force, the only agreement governing the affairs of the partnership was that dated May 1898 (First German Memorandum, Annex 2), under which Hassan Samieh had no such powers as suggested. 'the manner in which the affairs of the partner ship were conducted is shown in Mr. Malcolm’s statement (Appendix 17). It is, of course, nots &gt; i % 24 disputed that Hassan did attend to part of the business of the company, as did some of the other P- 23. partners, but that fact has no bearing on the question whether he had authority to make the contract in question. The same comment may be made on the letters from Mr. Malcolm to Hassan, PP- on which reliance is placed by the German P- 2S - Government; in fact, the first two letters are clear evidence that Hassan did not consider him self entitled to act without consulting his partners. The third letter is specifically addressed to the firm, and not to Hassan, and there is no evidence to show how it was dealt with. His Majesty’s Government are unable to agree that the proposed contract was “ very similar to that with Wonck- p- 23. haus,” but do not consider the point worth detailed discussion. No inference in favour of the conten tion of the German Government can be drawn from these letters. Esa’s letter to Sheikh Sagar, dated the 20th February, 1907 (Appendix 27), shows that he did not consider that Hassan possessed the authority now claimed for him, and four letters from Hassan Samieh are annexed (Appendix 18), which show that Hassan considered himself under an obligation to consult his partners, and knew that they were entitled to complain if he failed to do so. The phrase in Hassan’s letter of the 21st January, 1908, “You know what friendship existed between us and your father, Haji Ali, deceased, who did nothing except after consultation in our business,” suggests that, if one partner was more prominent than the others, it was Nakhoda Ali, and not Hassan. Hassan’s own contention throughout has been, not that he had authority to conclude the con tract without consulting his partners, but that they approved of it. In his letter to Abdul Latif (Annex 11 to First German Memorandum) he says : “You are the Lord of the Learned ; you know that I did this knowing that you were agreeable to it.” In his letter to Salim (Annex 18 to First German Memorandum) he says: “As you know, all the contracts and correspondence from the beginning till this day have been done by knowledge and approval of the British political agent, Abdul Latif, and all of you.” This shows that at the time he did not claim for himself the right which is now attributed to him. In conclusion, His Majesty’s Government would remark that, if Hassan really possessed the right25 to conclude the contract without consulting his partners, it is difficult to understand his attempts to conceal it from them, and to deceive them as to its terms. P- 16&gt; (M The German Government also contend that all the partners expressly approved the agreement, p. 16. The persons concerned (omitting Abdullah, who may be assumed to have supported his father) are Esa, Malcolm, and Nejef, son of Nakhoda Ali. P- 17 - The German Government dispute that Nejef was a partner, arguing that Nakhoda Ali “had a share on the strength of his engaging to super intend the work at the mines, without putting capital into the concern,” that his partnership was connected with personal services, and there fore ceased at his death. This contention is not supported by the terms of the document under which he became a partner (Annex 2 to First German Memorandum), which placed him in precisely the same position as the other partners. Moreover, as it is pointed out on p. 18 of the Second German Memorandum that the only partners who put any capital into the concern were Hassan and Malcolm, it follows, if the contention of the German Government is correct, that the other partners, who neither put capital into the concern nor superintended the ' work at the mines, had no claim to their shares at all. The suggestion that Nakhoda Ali was not p. 17. a partner, but only an “employe of the company with a share in the profits,” is plainly untenable, in view of the provision in the document under wdiich he became a partner (Annex 2 to First German Memorandum) that he was to bear his share of the expenses—an unheard-of pro vision in the case of an employe. It appears from Malcolm’s statement (Appendix 17) that Nakhoda Ali was originally the most important member of the firm ; and reference may also be made to the sentence quoted above from Hassan’s letter to Nejef, dated the 21st January, 1908. pp. 17, 50. The suggestion made by Abdul Latif, that it might be possible to extinguish Nakhoda Ali’s share at his death on the grounds indicated, must have come to nothing, judging by the later documents as if the surviving partners had thought it possible to get rid of the share in such a way, they would certainly have done so. [2294 f—2] H2(5 It may be that Hassan and Abdullah now con- p. 17. sider it advisable to deny that they considered Nejef a partner, but their letters written at the time (Appendices 18 and 19) show clearly that they did so consider him. The letters of Hassan, in particular, which are set out in Appendix 18, are conclusive on the point. Particular atten tion is also called to the letter dated the 24th December, 1907, from Malcolm, annexed in Appendix 20, which shows that at that time both Malcolm and Abdullah recognised Nejef as a partner. If Nejef was not and never had been a partner, the suggestion that he on several occasions p. 17. Oc3 # expressed his approval of Hassan s proceedings is meaningless; there would be no possible reason for his expressing an opinion on the matter if it did not concern him. Nejef is asserted to have expressed his approval P- 17* to Abdullah in the presence of the German dragoman in November 1907. No authority is given for this statement. Abdullah’s motives for attributing such a statement to Nejef are obvious, and His Majesty’s Government have explained already that they are unable-to attach any weight to statements made by the .ex-dragoman Mirza Hussein, who, as the German Government are no doubt aware, has now been denounced by the Persian Government, prosecuted by the Customs and Messrs. Wonckhaus for dishonesty, and dis missed from his post in the German consulate. Nejef has sworn an affidavit (Appendix 21) in which he denies having made the statement attributed to him, and his account is corrob orated by the letter written shortly afterwards by Malcolm, which is set out in Appendix 20, and also by Nejef s petition to Lieutenant Gabriel dated the 16th February, 1908 (First British Memorandum, Appendix 18). These documents also show plainly that Nejef was recognised as a partner. With regard to the statement said to have been pp. 17, 50, 51 made by Nejef to Brown (an employ6 of Wonck haus and Co.) in March 1908, to the effect that he approved of the contract with Wonckhaus, the story is incredible, in view of the fact that a month before Nejef had sent in a formal petition to the British vice-consul at Bunder Abbas (First British Memorandum, Appendix 18) stating that he “ did not in any way agree to this contract made by Hassan.Nejef’s account of the inter-view, as given by him on oath, is set out in Appendix 21. But even if the story were true, it would not affect the fact that in February 1908 Nejef expressed his disapproval in the most formal method at his disposal. In any case His Majesty’s Government are unable to consider nn expression of approval, given long after the cancellation of the concession, as equivalent to a confirmation of the contract. His Majesty’s Government ob-erve that the German Government do not allege that Malcolm ever expressly approved of the contract ; all that is stated is that no objection was raised by him. M ithout going into the question whether a failure to raise objections could amount to the necessary approval, it must be poinfed out that no inference can be drawn either from Malcolm’s silence or his letters, because of Hassan’s successful attempts, by means of falsehood and deception, to keep him in the dark as to the facts. When asked by Malcolm for a copy of the agree ment, he first made the untrue statement that the agreement was in German, and then asserted that Wonckhaus had bound him to secrecy ; while the account given by him in his letter of the 13th July, 1906 (First British Memorandum, Appendix 13) omitted the most important provisions of the contract. His Majesty’s Government are quite unable to agree that this letter “ communicated all that was of importance ”; the very provisions to which the other partners took objection when they heard of them were carefully omitted. This argument is also inconsistent with the further contention of the German Government that Hassan was entitled to keep the terms of the contract secret from Malcolm, because the latter was connected with Strick and Co., who held the Hormuz oxide concession. His Majesty’s Government are unable to appreciate this contention, and in any case it is clear from Hassan’s letter of the 14th October, 1906 (First British Memorandum, Appendix 14), that the person he really wished to keep in the dark was Abdul Latif, who had repeatedly warned him against making a contract of such a nature. In his letter of the 30th October, 1906 (Annex 34 to Second German Memorandum) Malcolm expressly protests against the terms of the agree-28 ment being* kept secret from the partners. This letter also expressly recognises the possibility ot the cancellation of the contract by the partneis, if they considered it advisable. When Malcolm did ultimately receive a copy of the agreement in December 1906, the contiact was already six months old, and while he was still considering what action to take the situation was completely changed by the cancellation of the concession by the sheikh. His Majesty's Government do not dispute the p. 19- fact that Abdul Latif, on behalf of Esa, did not object in 1905 to the sale of oxide to Wonckhaus at a fixed price, but, as it is not suggested that the contracts of that date contained the provisions to which he did afterwards object, it does not affect the present question. As regards his letter of the 14th June, 1906 (First British Memorandum, Appendix 12), His Majesty’s Government must repeat that no weight can be attached to any expression of approval (if such can be deduced from the terms of the letter) given in ignorance of the terms of the contract. The non-disclosure of material terms would be held fatal by an\ court in which it was sought to rely on any such expressions of approval as constituting a ratifica tion of the contract. And the letter expressly warns Hassan against entering into any contract which would give an outside party an excuse for claiming rights in the island. Such warnings had been given before, and Hassan had disclaimed any intention of entering into such a contract. In addition to the documents already quoted in this connection, reference may be made to two letters from Hassan to Abdul Latif, dated respectively the 30th January, 1905, and the 5th July, 1906 (Appendix 23). No doubt Hassan’s object was to conceal the ' terms of the contract from his partners for as long as possible, in order that when they were ulti mately discovered he might be able to say that the contract had been in operation so long that it was impossible to go back on it. W1 len Abdul Latif had an opportunity of examining the terms of the contract he objected in the plainest terms, and announced his resolution of cancelling the contract. The German Government contend that the p. 20. sentence in Abdul Latif’s letter of the 23rd29 pp. 52, 53. January, 1907 (Annex 36 to Second German Memo randum), which has been translated “ the nullifi- P* cation of this agreement is better than its accept ance,” really bears the meaning “It is better to try to cancel the agreement than to do as he [the German] wishes.” In support of this contention pp. 53-55. two opinions are quoted (Annexes 37 and 38 to Second German Memorandum) which reach this conclusion upon different grounds. Both these opinions are purely theoretical, and do not take local usage into account. His Majesty’s Govern ment would point out that in Enclosure 8 to the First German Memorandum the words in question are translated “The cession [? cessation] of this contract would be preferable to its continuance.” His Majesty’s Government also bring forward, in support of their view, the opinion (Appendix 24) of the well-known missionary the Kev. S. M. Zwemer, who has laboured for some fifteen years among the Arabs of the Persian Gulf, and probably knows their local peculiarities of speech and writing better than any other living man. His opinion entirely supports the contention of His Majesty’s Government. Being, however, of opinion that when the meaning to be attributed to a phrase is in question, the best evidence is that of the person who used it, His Majesty’s Government annex a statement (Appendix 25) by Abdul Latif, which makes it clear that he used the words in the sense attributed to them by His Majesty’s Government, and that such would be the ordinary meaning of the phrase as understood in those parts. The statement also shows that Hassan understood the words in that sense, and quoted them in that sense (but more grammatically and unmistakably) in his reply. This reply is set out in Appendix 26. P* 20 * His Majesty’s Government do not agree with the contention that Abdul Latit’s letter, by re commending the cancelling of the agreement, admits that it had legal force. It is admitted that the contract was binding as between Hassan and Wdnckhaus and Co., and therefore Hassan could only be released from it by cancellation; but the question at issue is whether it was bind ing on the partnership, and His Majesty’s Govern ment contend that the evidence is clear that it was not. There is no doubt that Esa himself objected to the contract when he heard of its terms. This is clearly shown by his letter of the 20th February, [2294/—2] I1907, to Sheikh Sagar (Appendix 27), which also proves that he did not consider Hassan as having authority to conclude the contract without con sulting his partners. His Majesty’s Government are therefore of opinion :— 1. That Hassan had no authority to conclude the contract in question without the consent of his partners. 2. That Nejef was a partner on the same terms as the others. 3. That neither Nejef, Malcolm, nor Esa ever approved the agreement, but, on the contrary, at least two of them, when they heard of the terms, formally expressed their disapproval. 4. That even if any expression of approval can be deduced from the terms of Abdul Latifs letter dated the 14th June, 1906, it was given in ignor ance of the most important terms of the contract, which had been wrongfully concealed by Hassan from his partners, and that on hearing of those terms Abdul Latif emphatically repudiated the transaction. IV. The agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus is advan- P- 28 - tageous to the mining com,pang, so that the partners have not been injured by Hassan Samaih's action as manager. It is not considered necessary to consider again the question whether the agreement was finan- P- 24- cially for the benefit of the company, especially as, no accounts ever having been rendered by Hassan to his partners, it is impossible to test the accuracy of the books as now quoted. It is only necessary to remark that at least two of the partners considered that the arrangement was not advantageous to the company, and formally protested against it. It may also be added that, if it really was to the benefit of the company to enter into the contract, it becomes more difficult than ever to account for Hassan’s anxiety to conceal its terms from his associates. It is possible, however, that this desire for concealment was due to a feeling that the contract might impair the relations between the company and the sheikh, in which case it would not be to the advantage of the company, even though financially it might have led to an increased revenue.t p. 28. p. 28. p. 15. p. 15. A 31 V Ihere was therefore no reason for a complaint of the company against Hassan Samaih on the ground of action contrary to agreement or duty. Ihis point has been discussed under the two preceding heads. VI. There was accordingly no ground for action on the part of Sheikh Sagar against Hassan Samaih for the protection of the other partners. Moreover, the scat of the company is at Lingah, and the partners of the com pany are not subjects of the Sheikh of Shargeh, so that he has no jurisdiction in matters concerning the relations of the partners with each other. In any case, he could not exercise such jurisdiction himself, but shoidd have had the dispute settled by the judge. Although it is hardly accurate to say that Sheikh Sagar took action against Hassan, it has been shown that there was abundant ground for his action when appealed to on behalf of the partners whose wishes and instructions had been disregarded, and who had been deceived, by their associate Hassan. It has been already pointed out that it has never been contended by His Majestys Govern ment (or, as is admitted on p. 15 of the Second German Memorandum, by Sheikh Sagar) that the sheikhs action in cancelling the concession was intended to be that of a judge deciding the rights of the partners as between themselves ; it was an act which in his sovereign capacity he was entitled to do, and no doubt one of his objects was to release the complaining partners from the position in which they found themselves owing to the unauthorised action of Hassan. This being so, the arguments adduced in the Second German Memorandum to show that the sheikh was not the proper tribunal to adjust the rights .of the partners are beside the mark. It is only neces sary to remark that, as far as the cancellation of the concession was concerned, the sheikh was the only person who could act. A✓ 32 * After the cancellation ot the concession, the adjustment of the rights of the partners, as between themselves, by the appropriate tribunal (whatever that may prove to be) would under normal circumstances have been an easy matter. Nor is it impossible that the sheikh might have been willing to grant a fresh concession under proper conditions. But the course events have taken, in particular the intervention of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co., has so far rendered this impracticable ; though when the questions now at issue have been settled it may yet be possible for steps to be taken in the matter. In any case, the pp. 15, 16 question whether Sagar’s action violated the rights of the partners, who were all British subjects, is obviously one to be discussed, if at all, between the sheikh and His Majesty’s Govern ment. VII. * The agreement between the mining company ancL^p- 28. Mr. Wonckhaus, which is nothing but the conclusion of an ordinary and permissible business transaction, and which cannot have any political aims, neither infringes the lease agreement nor is in any way dangerous to the interests of the State of Shargeh, so that the action taken by Sheikh Sugar against the company cannot be justified on the ground of the general interests of the administration of the country. It has been already pointed out that, whether the sheikh’s action was “justifiable” or not, it was certainly one which he had power to take, and could not legally be questioned. His Majesty’s Government agree that the contract with Wonckhaus was not strictly a letting of the p. 26. mines to him. But it is submitted that it was not unnatural that the sheikh should look with some apprehension upon the acquisition of so large an interest in the produce of the mines by persons who were subject neither to his juris diction nor to that of the British Resident in the Persian Gulf. The German Government are aware that as late as 1904 an attempt was made to seize Abu Musa by a Belgian customs officer in the Persian service, who hauled down the sheikh’s flag and hoisted the Persian standard. And it cannot be denied that the actions of Messrs. Wonckhaus have been eminently calculated 't° suggest that they were anxious to claim rights in the island and not merely in the produce of the mines. Thus, on the 19th October, 1907, Messrs. Wonckhaus wrote to the sheikh :— “ We consider the mines and the concession for them as a security for the advances paid. If you force Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Somayah and Co. to withdraw their coolies and representatives, we shall have to send over some men ourselves to protect our property.” M hen Brown and his men left for the island on the 22nd October, 1907, they took with them a German flag, which it was intended to place on the accumulations of oxide. On the 19th November, 1907. tlie German vice- consul at Bushire threatened the sheikh with a claim for a lakh of rupees, and claimed for Messis. Wonckhaus the right of direct concern in the working of the mines. His Majesty's Government entirely agree with the German Government that the question in this case is purely commercial, and not political. But in view of the above facts, it appears that Sagars fears were not altogether as “senseless” as has been suororested. For reasons already given, h &gt;wever, His Majesty s Government are of opinion that the question whether such considerations “justified ” the sheikh’s action does not arise. VIII. Sheikh Sakar's interference is not limited to redressing a wrong alleged to have been done by one partner to the others, or to preventing the carrying out of an agreement alleged to be contrary to the interests of the country, but simply deprives the whole company of the basis of its existence. The company, in which the German firm of Robert 11 onckhaus and Co. have a share, is thereby very seriously injured, since the realisation of its object is made impossible, and it is not in a position to carry out current obligations imposed upon it by contract. No new points are raised under this head. Sheikh Sagar’s action was the only one he could take with a view to putting an end to the position in which the company found itself owing to the [2294/—2J 'raction of Hassan. It may be mentioned that so far from Sheikh Sugar having “ put in his pocket P- the whole valuable object in connection with which the company was founded,” the result of his action has been that no revenue has been received from the mines from that day to this. The question whether Wonckhaus and Co. can be considered as interested in the company is considered below. It is no doubt unfortunate that the company has been unable to resume its operations since the cancellation, but, as has been pointed out above, that is not the fault of the sheikh, but is due to the course which atlairs have taken. IX. Sakov's 'proceedings, then, are clearly a violation P* of law—an exercise of arbitrary power. The German Government do not suggest what law it is that was violated by Sagar s proceedings. His Majesty’s Government have already pointed out that the sheikh’s right to cancel the concession is one that cannot be questioned, and that it is a mistake to consider his action as an adjudication of the rights of the parties as between themselves. His Majesty’s Government must also repeat, ; that even if Sagar’s proceedings were “a violation of law,” the question would be, under the circum stances, one which could only concern the sheikh and His Majesty’s Government. His Majesty’s Government regret that they are p. entirely unable to recognise Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. as in any way concerned in the present question. It is clear that Messrs. Wonckhaus had a good cause of action for breach of contract against Hassan; or, if the contention of the German Government were correct, that the con tract was binding on the partnership, they would have a cause of action against the partnership. They have never attempted to avail themselves of either ot these remedies. It is obvious, there fore, that Messrs. Wonckhaus can have no claim against Sheikh Sagar in their capacity as parties to the contract, whether it was made with Hassan or with the mining company.Jl p. 29. ■«- ■« t x^y 35 It would appear that no serious attempt is made in the Second German Memorandum to maintain the proposition that Messrs. Wonckhaus are concerned in the matter as having purchased a share in the partnership eight months after the cancellation of the concession. Apart from the fact that the transference of a share in an extinct concession could have no legal effect, it is difficult to see what cause of action, either in contract or in tort, could exist against the sheikh, at the suit of Messrs. Wonckhaus, for cancelling a concession to which they were not parties. It is not dis puted that Messrs. Wonckhaus were aware, at the time when they purported to purchase the share, that the concession had been cancelled. Even assuming that the cancellation was unjustifiable, it cannot be disputed that it was effective, and that the concession came to an end at that time. If the cancellation was unjustifiable, it might give rise to a claim for compensation by the persons who were partners in the firm at the time, but certainly not to a claim by persons who, with full knowledge of the facts, purported to acquire a share months later. Thus, in any case, Messrs. Wonckhaus have no locus standi; and His Majesty’s Government can only regard their action as an attempt to place themselves in a position which would enable them to bring pressure on the sheikh. It is noteworthy that an attempt was made in November 1907 to induce Nejef to transfer his share to Abdullah (see Appendix 21), and the fact that the transfer was to bear a date previous to the contract between Wonckhaus and Hassan, and therefore previous to the cancellation of the concession, suggests that the intention was to retransfer the share to Messrs. Wonckhaus. It may also be remarked that the sales of the share in question by Yussuf to Hassan, and by Hassan to Brown, were invalid in any case, because the documents of transfer did not bear the signatures of all the partners, as was neces sary under the deed by which Malcolm became a partner (see Appendix 16). The concession having been cancelled, and Hassan having disregarded the warning given him on the 3rd October, 1907, to remove his coolies and gear within ten days, the sheikh was clearly entitled to take steps to ensure their36 1 emoval. The action taken by His Majesty’s • overnment to ensure that no breach of the • eace should take place was explained in the His Majesty’s Government have already given PP- the correct account of the proceedings when Brown attempted to land on Abu Musa. It is clear that the employes of Messrs. Wonckhaus had admitted by the statement on p. 26 of the Second German Memorandum : “ The stipulation that the oxide is to be delivered free on board, and the detailed arrangements concerning the quantity to of the mines themselves.” Thus the sheikh had a perfect right to prevent the men from landing, and no claim for compensation can possibly be put forward on those grounds. opinion that Messrs. Wonckhaus have no claim against Sheikh Sagar or His Majesty’s Govern- ent. Foreign Office, December C, 1911.

If the vessel is in serious danger, the persons rendering assistance claim half the value of the goods salved, a procedure sanctioned by local usage, but this residency has refused to recognise that they have any absolute right to demand such a share in the absence of agreement with the Nakhuda of the vessel. Local customs in this matter, as in others, depend more on “ might ” than “ right,’ and efforts are always made to mulct the owners and Nakhodas of vessels as much as possible. Appendix 5.

After compliments and enquiries after your health, I beg to address you in regard to your enquiry regarding the undermentioned three points connected with the Abu Musa case : 1 2 3 1. You say that it is claimed that on the 12th Shaaban, 1316, after my return from the Hajj, Sheikh Salim granted to three persons an agreement for the extraction of mica from Bu Musa Island without any permission from me, and you enquire from me that if I w-as aware of the same, how was it that 1 did not mention this agreement to you on the 19th Moharram, 1326, when I presented to you a statement of my relations with Sheikh Salim in regard to the Bu Musa Island. 2. You also mention to me the question of jetsam and flotsam on the Bu Musa Island, and state that it is claimed that Sheikh Salim was receiving the income on this account; and 3. You have also shown me the translation of a paper which is claimed to be dated the 4th Zilkhadeh, 1315, and to be the first draft of the oxide contract which was altered to another form on the 18th Zilkhadeh, 1315.39 This is my reply with regard to three points : th .® mica agreement, I was fully aware of it, and Sheikh a^men? eo,dd h” ’ ^7* 'A 1 and it wouW not have bin possible that the said ^nforni vou b ^*77 t0 my knowled g e as ruling chief.

It was my wish that s lou ( ge something from it, and that he should not trouble me about his expenses t i p ^condiy as regards the right to jetsam and flotsam on Bu Musa Island and all uhe Islands of Kowasim, it is not open to doubt that it is due to the chief of the PvTIfTn 1 ’- mt , t ie US ?u Custom ° l \ the 0m an coast is that the inhabitants of the place act then rights on the scene of the wreck, and when the chief comes to know of it he set es the matter according to his own opinion ; sometimes he takes his own share 1 1 ft e iffu and sometlmes cn h e does not take from them. In the case of Bu Musa, as I had left all the revenue to Sheikh Salim, I treated my right of jetsam and flotsam as a part of the income to go to him and used to ask no questions about it. ^ rc 7&gt; ^ d i regard to the rejected draft of the oxide agreement, I have now noted its wording but had neither seen nor heard of it before. The reason for its rejection is obviously because Sheikh Salim could not write about Bu Musa in these terms namely So Jong as I, my children, and my brothers live, no one is entitled to raise objection to it.

Ali Ahmed Saleh is the man whose identity you know as Nakhoda Ali. I had nothing to do with the writing or drafting of this document. I remember that I had been absent on duty at Bushire during the spring of the year in question, and it was on my return to Shargah that the project for an oxide concession was discussed. The draft had been drawn up by Abdullah-bin-Hassan Samieh, and it was he who showed it to me. At the same time he and Nakhoda Ali, who was also there, asked me to let my son Isa come into the concern as they needed some one on the spot at Shargah in order to keep in touch with Sheikhs Sagar and Salim. I agreed, but pointed out that the terms of the proposed concession as at present drafted were quite impossible, and that neither Sheikh Sagar would confirm it nor would the Government approve it. What I especially objected to was (1) the sentence in which Sheikh Salim is made to say : “ so long as I, my children, and my brothers live, no one will be entitled to raise objection to it,” and (2) the inclusion of Nakhoda Ali as a signatory on the document. With regard to (1), I would explain that Salim was an old man of 70, who might be expected to die at any time, and I was taking into account the fact that if he died, we should thenceforth have to deal with Sheikh Sagar. As regards (2) I thought the inclusion of Nakhoda Ali was inexpedient, as I had just been visiting Bushire and knew him to be in very bad odour with the residency in connection with his Bushire affairs, and he was also at loggerheads with the well-known Muin-ut-Tujjar of Tehran, holder of the Hormuz concession, and I feared the latter would be likely to give us trouble if he came to know that Nakhoda Ali was a partner in a rival oxide enterprise. I also omitted the twenty-year time limit, as I saw no object in inserting any fixed period of time. ABDUL LATIF-BIN-ABDURRAHMAN. March 25, 1911. Appendix 10. Note by Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif on the reference to a Dispute between Sheikhs Sugar and Salim regarding Sir Abu Nuair Island {made in his letter of the 21th Jamadi II, 1316 (November 14, 1898). Your honour enquires from me to what I referred in my letter dated the 27th Jamadi II, 1316, when I wrote the following sentence *— ‘‘As regards Sir a dispute has arisen between Sheikhs Sagar and Salim. It is Sagar’s intention to lease without mentioning Salim’s name and to give some advantage to Salim, but Salim would not agree to this.” The explanation of the above passage is as follows :— It will be remembered that in the second agreement between Sheikh Sagar and Sheikh Salim (dated 1884), at which my predecessor was the intermediary, Sheikh Sagar granted to Sheikh Salim an annual pension of 400 dollars together with the revenue 5 of Sir Bu Nuair, which was expected to bring in some 200 dollars. Up to 1889, however, this island did not produce any revenue as was expected and consequently no mention was made^ of it in tiie third agreement dated the 5th Shaaban, 1306 (1889), and Sheikh Salim ceased to take any interest in it.

The lease will not be valid without proposal and acceptance by legal formula and without the specification of a fixed period. And God knows more. M ritten by Ibrahim-bin-Abdullah. (Aote. —Chief Sunni Mullah of Bushire.) 2. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. According to the question, this lease is null and void. A ritten by Mohamed Ali Al-i-Osfoor. (L.S.) Confident in God the Bounteous. (L.S.) His slave, Mohamed Ali-bin-Muhammad Taki. (Note. Imam Juma, the official High Priest of Bushire.) 3. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Amongst the conditions for the validity of a lease are the specifications and record ot the period of the lease. Supposing, for instance, he were to say, “ I have let the house at the rate of 1 toman per mensem/’ such a lease is legally null and void, and if the lessee says a prayer in such a house the prayer will be futile. And as to this question there is no difference of opinion between the distinguished ulemas, and God is aware of His precepts. Written by the humble Mohamed Ali-el-Moosevi-ed-Dehdasty-en-Nejafi. (L.S.) The hopeful Mohamed Ali-el-Moosevi. (A otc. The most venerable Shia Mullah in Bushire.) 4. It should be understood that the conditions for the validity of a lease are six oy the absence of any of which six conditions the lease is null and void. The first ri s ] the compact, i.e., the proposal and acceptance, intended to indicate the fact of the assumption of the profit for a fixed period in return for something specific. Secondly, the legality of the possession. Thirdly, the taking cognizance of the rent or the measure or weight or number, fourthly, the specification of the profit by time or by [2294/—2] N40 the job. Fifthly, the retention of the profit in possession or its coming under that category [of possession]. Sixthly, the defining of the period of the lease in such a manner that it shall become neither less nor more. I he subject-matter of the question [under reply], being void of certain of the conditions, namely, the compact and the period, and the cognizance of the amount of the profit, is not valid, and God is aware of the truth of affairs. Written b\ the humble Abdullah-el-Moosevi-el-Baladi. (L.S.) (Note .—The chief mullah of the Ussuli sect of Shias in Bushire.) 5. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. The distinguished ulemas—may their blessings amongst the people endure— have defined “lease” to be the taking possession of an ascertained profit in return for something specific. So whatever is like giving possession of original property, for instance by selling it, is a thing extraneous to a compact of lease, and so is anything in which the profit is not defined, either in itself—such as by the act of sewing of a certain garment or the riding of a certain animal to a certain place—or by the fixing of a period such as a full year. And thus, as regards the subject of the question, whereas, it is not a case of taking possession of a profit, but of the original property and, whereas, the profit is not fixed by eit’ier of the tw r o methods aforesaid, the lease is accordingly null and void, on both counts, and it is obvious that while there is no contradiction in the said two rulings, it is recorded that the majority set store by the last. And God is aware of His Commands Written by this humble servant of the Shera, Murteza-el-Moosevi, Sadr-el-Islam. (L.S.) (Note .—Seyyid Murteza-el-Moosevi is the stipendiary “ Sadr-el-Islam,” of Bushire, much respected for his piety.) 6. Praise be to God. This lease as it is written is null and void and is not valid. The conditions for the lease, viz., the formula of proposal and acceptance and the stipulation of the time are not (made) therein. Further, if the mines are open they cannot be turned into property and the lease is not proper. 1'his, and God the Highest knows more. Written by the humblest Muhammad Mehdi-bin-Abdullah. (L.S.)

(Note. —Sunni Arab Kazi of Kalet on the Persian coast.) 14. The Answer .—The lease has conditions ; if a single condition thereof is violated the lease is spoiled. How is it now that (several) conditions are omitted ? The first is that a lease requires bond such as proposal and acceptance; and the second of the conditions thereof is that it should be for a known period. So this, which is written in the question, should be nullified for several reasons, and it cannot be valid in this condition which is stated. And God knows more. ABDUL KERIM-BIN-AHMED (Servant of the august law, at Keis, by his own hand).48 15. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Praise be to God, Who leads to the right. The said lease is invalid and illegal in several respects and does not contain all the conditions. The first of the reasons for its invalidity is that the period of the lease is unspecified. The second reason is that the formula of the lease has not beer^ pronounced therein. The third reason is that, legally speaking, the right to any ground rent, in the manner mentioned in the question, is unknown (i.e., inadmissible) from all points of view. To take interest on unknown articles for an unknown period, and to compare it to rent is unlawful. In short, this lease, as quoted in the question, according to “ the following copy,’’ is not compatible with the precepts of the august Shera law. And God knows best.

And God knows the right better. Written by the humblest of the members of the clergy, Abdullah - bin* JVJuhammad Saeed-el-Ansari, of Kehit. 8. The Answer. —A lease has several conditions and if a single condition (thereof) is violated, the Gase becomes invalid, and how it would be now that several conditions have been omitted therefrom. Firstly, it becomes binding by a known period, this has been omitted, however. Secondly, a lease becomes binding by proposal and acceptance. Should these conditions be absent, the lease is null and void, and when the lease is nullified it is for the lessor to take possession of his property and to lease it to another; and God knows best. (Signed and sealed) ABDUL KERIM-BIN-AHMED (Servant of the august Shera law, by his own hand.) And if the owner of the property wishes to turn out the lessee, he can turn him out immediately. (Signed and sealed) ABDUL KERIM (Servant of the Shera law at Keis). 9. The Answer. —Praise be to God, who leads to the right! This lease as it is mentioned in the question is not in accord with the precepts of the august Shera, and is null and void and invalid. So, the owner of the property has the option to return to his property, and he has the absolute possession thereof, and can use his property in any manner that he mav wish. He has the option (to do so), and the lessee has no right or title in that property. And whatever is invalid according to the august Shera is to be considered as non-existent. Should the proprietor desire to turn out the lessee from that place he can do so. and there is nothing to bind the owner of the place. And God knows more !

Statement of Mr. T. J. Malcolm. MR. TTGRANE MALCOLM! appears before me this 30th day of May, 1911, and makes the following statement:— “ The history of my entry into the Abu Musa oxide concern was as follows :— I had been for some years connected with the trade in oxide from Hormuz in association with Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh, in whose name the concession then was. He, however, lost the concession and then, in consultation with me, he set to work to obtain a concession for extracting Abu Musa oxide, having first made a trial shipment. It was Xakhoda Ali who first started the Abu Musa mining, Hassan Sameiyeh knew nothing about the oxide trade until Nakhoda Ali introduced him to it. The latter had at this time a very bad name with the local authorities and in commercial circles in the Gulf ports, and so he found it convenient to work through Hassan Sameiyeh. “ After securing the Abu Musa concession the parties thought it would be to their advantage to bring me into it with a view to my arranging the shipments to Europe and elsewhere, and so I came into it. Nakhoda Ali was the moving spirit in the acquiring of the concession, Hassan Sameiyeh was only used as a screen. The former was in charge of the mining work and always complained greatly of the obstructiveness of Abdullah Sameiyeh and his father Hassan, and their ignorance of matters connected with the oxide trade. Owing, however, to his own state of bankruptcy Nakhoda Ali could not take a piominent part in the concern, and so Abdullah and Hassan gradually began to dominate it. Nakhoda Ali managed the work on the island, 1 was expected to manage the sales and shipment to Europe, and Hassan acted as corresponding member of the company. No paiticular basis of authority existed, so far as I know r , on which Hassan w r as entitled to act and to the best of my belief (and I have an excellent memory) I have ne\ei leaid of or seen the so-called memorandum of association which you have now sliowm me, much less did I ever sign it or receive a copy of it. “ Nor was I consulted at all or informed regarding the sale of a share in the concern by Sheikh Sagar to \ usuf-bln-Abdullah, or by Yusuf to Hassan, or Hassan to Brown ; it is all news to me. “ In any case, Hassan Sameiyeh never acted according to the rules now shown to me. He has never rendered any accounts at all. In fact, the mismanagement of , lm( y e f y tie extravagance of Abdullah have always been a great cause of complaint both to me and Nakhoda AliT complaint both to me and Nakhoda AIL Bushire, Maij 30, 1911. Before me: P. Z. Cox, Lieutenant-Colonel, British Resident in the Persian Gulf. T. J. MALCOLM. I i i'54 island. Had any steamer visited there, how could I have omitted to write by letter to that effect? This news is false. You have also heard that the steamer “ Mohamedi” will arrive at Bu Musa. This has not become known, and no communication has been made with them (i.e., the agents of the company) regarding the arrival of the steamer. You had stated that you required Omani tobacco. Tobacco is absolutely unavailable at Lingah nowadays. It cannot be procured even at 6 rs. 8 a. per maund. (rod willing I will send you [ some] as soon as I obtain it.

I/iugah, Ztlhijjeh, 132o (Januavy 21, 1908). I beg to advise you that I could not leave home for a period of forty days as I was sick, and that I am, God willing, better nowadays. I have heard from Abbas Haji All Akbar that you had written to him requesting him to speak with this humble in regard to Bin Musa. Indeed I did not expect that such a message would come from you by anyone, before you come to me in person and receive the facts and go into the matters (i.e., learn the circumstances). Then you will come to know the account; and every thing with me is kept in proper order. And I consider you like a son and in the same position as my son Abdullah, and you know what friendship existed between us and your father, Haji Ali deceased, who did nothing except after consultation in our business. And you yourself have [nevertheless] forgotten his attitude towards us while we were hopeful that you will follow his footstep. What is certain to me is that you will not keep such things (i.e., such ideas) in your mind, and that you will personally come to me and receive the facts of the matter from my own mouth, verbally, and it will become clear to you. And as regards the affairs of the island, they are pending up to now, and no settlement has as yet been made with the antagonist. I am on the same friendly terms with you as with your father, and it is my hope that your mind will not be annoyed with us. You are [however] of a hasty temper, and listen to the statements of jealous parties; [but] the matter should not be misunderstood by you. You are like a son in my estimation, owing to the friendship which I had with your father. In my opinion, you should come to us at Lingah for a week’s time and, God willing, all will be well in our interview. This is what was to be stated, and may you ever remain preserved and guarded. My son Abdullah sends you salaams. (Note. —This letter is in the handwriting of Abdulloh-bin-Hassan Samieh.) Appendix 19. Hassan-bin-Ali Samieh to Nejef-bin (late) Haji Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh.

You should forward it to Calcutta soon, because they have delayed the uocuments of compromise until they receive the power from you.OD Abdullah-bin-TIassan Samieh to Nejef-bin (late) Eaji Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh. (Tran ilation. - ) (Aftor compliments.) _ Calcutta, 1st Shaaban, 1322 (October 11, 1904). is now a long time that 1 have received no letters from you. Perhaps the cause which prevented it is good. 1 am always receiving letters from my father, Hassan, who gives me the news of }’Our health. You should, God willing, inform me of your health and the news of your side by every mail. O my brother, 1 beg to advise you in connection with the dispute which was between us and Sassoon. We have settled with Sassoon, and it has been arranged that a compromise should be effected. And we have written papers of compromise for the settlement of the dispute. And whereas your father was one of the partners and he has now passed away, and whereas you are in his place and are his executor, it is necessary that you should give a power of attorney from yourself in my name so that I may affix in the documents your signature with the signatures of the partners which are [recorded] in the documents held by me in the case v. Sassoon, as Sassoon knows that Haji Ali has passed away, and that I, Abdullah, was his agent at Calcutta. Now, after Haji Ali s death, it is obvious that you are his executor, and it is necessary that you should write a power of attorney for me [saying] that I am your agent in Calcutta in all the affairs which may occur in Calcutta, as I was before in the affairs of your father. For this purpose I have now written a power of attorney in English in accordance with the law which will be accepted by the court; it is a power of attorney from you in my name. There is also an affidavit testifying that you are Nejef-bin-Haji Ali, his executor and attorney, and that you are nowin his place. This certificate, together with the power, should be taken by yourself to the British resident or assistant resident at Bunder Abbas, and you should, in his presence, admit that you are the son of Haji Ali, and are in your father’s place, and that you have made this power in the name of Abdullah-bin-Hassan, who is to be your agent in Calcutta, as he was before in the lifetime of Haji Ali. Also the resident or the assistant resident should certify in the affidavit that you are Haji Ali’s son and his representative. You should also take a writing from the Belgian director of customs that you are Haji Ali’s son and his representative, and obtain another certificate from the postmaster and expedite sending them to me by registered post soon and without delay, and write on the cover my address in English as follows :— A. H. H. Samieh and Co., 34/1, College Street, Calcutta. You should not delay the power and the documents, but send them to me at an early date. I have also advised my father, Hassan, who will also let you know and urge upon you. I know that at the moment of their arrival you will expedite sending them on. I have written you by this post, and I now intend going to the solicitors, so that I may write the power and the affidavit and send them to you by registered post. I need not urge you further that you should expedite doing what I have advised you. This is what was necessary. The letter was written most hastily. Your humblest friend, ABDULLAH-BIN-HASSAJN samieh. P.S. (in red ink).—I was unable to send the power by this mail as it was not prepared. God willing, I shall send it to you by the next mail.

And let it not be hidden from you that owing to the fact that Haji Ali has passed away, there is need for a power from you so that I may sign for you in the papers appertaining to the compromise, because, in the beginning there was in our hand a power from your father, Haji Ali, [stating] that I was his agent in Calcutta, and after your father’s death I informed [them] that you were in your father’s place ; and the court demanded that you should write a power for me setting forth that you are the attorney and executor of the will of your father, and also that I am agent in Calcutta on your behalf in the Sassoon case, and for the oxide, &amp;c., and the power should be [written] in English in accordance with the law, because Haji Ali has passed away and it is necessary that the court should understand that Haji Ali has no son beside you. Therefore, in order to settle the affairs I have written in your name a special power in the case of oxide and our dispute with Sassoon [saying] that what we now arrange with Sassoon for settlement by compromise is agreed upon by you. I intended sending the power by registered post by this mail but it was not ready. This is for your information, and, God willing, it will reach you by registered post next mail. You should act upon the instructions which I will now explain to you :— When you receive the power, you should take it to the resident or British vice- consul and assistant resident at Bunder Abbas. He will read it over to you and you should admit before him that this power is from you to me and that I am your agent in Calcutta in the same way as in the days of your father, and affix your signature—Nejef- bin-Ali-Ahmed-Saleh—in the place which is marked in pencil, then the resident or vice- consul will record his testimony and seal it with the Government seal. You should forward it soon and avoid procrastination and delay and you should send it to me by registered post to Calcutta soon and without delay. On the same day when it reaches you, you should take it to the resident or the assistant who is now present at Bunder Abbas. I have written you this letter by this mail so that you may know that you will receive the power by registered post. I am sending you this letter in my father’s letter and have forwarded another letter to you by post. Surely I will write you by the next mail also with the power. Your letters to me should continue without interruption as before when Haji Adi continuously kept me informed of the situation and of the reports. This is what was necessary to be said at present. _ God willing, I will settle matters after the receipt of the power and proceed to your side in Shavval. Tins is what had to be stated, and may you remain preserved and generous. Your friend, ABDULLAH-BIN-HASSAN SAMIEH. Appendix 20. Mu. T. J.

I am further told that Nejef had deXed to give Samieh the required declaration. J ecimea IO57 Appendix 21. Affidavit of Nejef-bin-Nakhoda Ali, dated March 19, 1910. ^ Nejef-bin-Haji Nakhoda Ali states on solemn affirmation :— I solemnly declare the following to be the facts regarding my interviews with Mr Ihomas Brown, of Messrs Wonckhaus and Co., and, if necessary, I am prepared to confirm this statement by oath on the Koran before a mujtebed. I have had several conversations about the Abu Musa case’with parties interested, le rs ^‘^ s w en Abdullah-bin-Hassan Samieh came to see me accompanied by Mirza Hussem Germani They came to Bunder Abbas and stayed in the house of Haji mm-ut lujjar. Abdullah, on landing from the ship, came to my house and asked me to come over and have a talk about the matter at Haji Amin’s house. I went over to Haji Amins house, and there Mirza Hussein, Abdullah, and Haji Ali “Germani” were present. Abdullah asked me to give him a paper stating that I handed over my share of the concession on Abu Musa to Abdullah-bin-Hassan. The paper was to be given a date prior to the date of* the contract between Messrs. Wonckhaus and Hassan. He also asked me to give him another paper saying that I was quite satisfied with the C0 Jli ^ refused, saying that I would not do anything of the sort unless they settled up my account with David Sassoon, that is, my father’s, on account of oxide, carpets, &amp;c. I said if they did not give me back the carpets they should pay me 20,000 rupees and settle my account, and then I would give them the paper. However, they did not give me the money, and I mentioned the matter to the British consulate' ihese two persons came to Bunder Abbas not long after the British consul, Lieutenant Gabiiel, returned there from a trip he made to Shargah, &amp;c. Some months later Mr. Brown came to Bunder Abbas. The exact date can be ascertained from the consul, under Abbas, as I reported the matter to him at the time, but it was just about two years ago. Mr. Brown had two interviews with me, once at the house of Jamshidian’s agent and once at the custom-house. At the first interview Agha Ghulam Ali Khoiassani was present, at the second Mr. Moses Khan, the customs director. Ao-ha Ghulam Ali is agent of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. Mr. Brown had a long talk w°ith me. Before beginning to talk about Abu Musa he dismissed two Hindoos, Gulshan and Asanand Ghulab. Mr. Brown asked me why I had not signed the paper shown me by Abdullah and Mirza Hussein. I said there appeared to be no advantage for me in doing so, and therefore I hadn’t. Mr. Brown said he had bought the share in the oxide company belonging to Sheikh Sagar for 250 reals. I replied that Sheikh Sagar had never made anything out of the business, and so would sell cheap. Mr. Brown said he wanted to buy my share, and said that he would settle up all my accounts with Hassan- bin-Ah and Abdullah. I never offered to sell my share to Mr. Brown. In fact, as I reported to the consulate at the time, Mr. Brown offered to buy my share. I would swear to this on the Koran. This took place in the presence of Agha Ghulam Ali Khorassani. At the second interview, and after Mr. Moses Khan tried to persuade me to go to Lingah to settle with Mr. Brown, he continued to endeavour to make me do this for a long time, and, on my refusing, he got annoyed with me, and worried me to such an extent that I finally had to resign my post as Hamal Bashi at Bunder Abbas.

During my interview with you we held a conversation about the visit to Abu Musa Island of Wonckhaus, the German, and you said you heard it was in connection with the lease of that island, and you warned me not to let him approach me. Please note that the fuct is this as I informed you, that Wonckhaus visited the island merely to inspect the oxide, saying that if he approved (the oxide) he would perhaps com municate with me with regard to the price, and would probably buy some. This was his object. You should not think that I would fail to let you know if he communi cated with me on the subject which you indicate. We could not allow this sort of interference from any one, especially on the part of these persons. You may rest assured. On seeing the oxide he approved that from one of the mines and returned to Lingah, and says that he will perhaps buy 300 tons if he obtains reasonable rates of freight. He left for Bushire some time ago, and has opened a branch there for the transaction of business. Hassan Samieh to Abdul Latif. (After compliments.) Lingah, 12th Jumadi I, 1324 (July 5, 1906). Your esteemed letter, dated Rabi ul Thani, reached me in due course, and 1 understood what you said. In particular regarding the receipt by you of my letter and your comprehension of its purport with reference to our transaction with the German. Insh Allah it will turn out well. You told me to take care that he did not get any bond from me (which would enable him) to enter the island. Set your mind59 at rest, I, your brother, am knowledgable and well versed in matters of business, and am &lt;ir rom acting in such away as you indicate. He has not the presumption to ir !‘ l j e ove . r ^ u ^ es ^ me ^ that direction. For, just as I told you, he is only a purchaser o ie oxic e itself, nothing more. Whether it be he or someone else, whoever wants to buy the oxide from me, if the price suits me I shall sell it. Do not let any idea peyond this enter your head. You may rest assured. (Letter goes on to speak of other matters.) Appendix 24. The Rev. S. M. Zwemcr to Lieutenant-Colonel Cox. Bahrein, May 29, 1911. v\ itly reference to the meaning of the Arabic sentence and the probable intention of the writer in using those words concerning which point you asked my opinion, I take pleasure in replying as follows :— L irst, it is evident that whoever wrote the sentence was not a thorough scholar in Arabic, as he confused the masculine and feminine forms in the last word of the sentence. To my mind the obvious translation of the phrase is, “ the annulment of this agreement is better than its acceptance.” I do not think it is at all obvious or possible to translate the sentence “ the annulment of this agreement is better than to comply with (his wishes).” This translation is, to my mind, a forced one, and not the natural significance of the words in question, whatever be their connection. I am confirmed in this opinion after consulting with one or two Arabs concerning the popular use of the pronoun in such a sentence, and I find that they agree with me that there is a great looseness in the use of the feminine or masculine pronoun at the close of a clause or sentence. I am sure that nine out of ten Arabs would give the preference to the former translation of the sentence as the obvious and natural intention of the writer. Although my opinion does not carry weight beyond that of others who have a speaking and reading knowledge of Arabic, yet I feel confident that in this case it is not a matter of expert grammatical opinion, but of everyday usage in the Persian Gulf, and I have no hesitation in saying that the first translation is the right one. Appendix 25. Note by Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif on the meaning of the doubtful passage in his Letter to Hassan Samieh, dated 8th Zilhejjeh, 1324 {January 23, 1907). I beg to refer to the sentence in my letter dated 8th Zilhijjeh, 1324 (23rd January, 1907), which runs as follows :— i dJb JlkiuLA and about the meaning of which there have been arguments. I beg to say that my meaning when I wrote the sentence was :— 2* {OAyXS (“ The annulment of this agreement is better than the acceptance of this agreement.”) It is not hidden from your Honour that I received my education in the Gulf, and that I am not an expert in the niceties of grammar and the shades of meaning of various measures of words. When I write, I write according to the usages and under standing of the community in which I live.60 As regards the use of the measure as synonymous with JV&gt; t,ie use is quite an ordinary one in these parts, and I can mention many other instances of the same, such as (“reposing”), (“continuance ), ( 3em g ruined”), (“advancing”), (“remaining”). There is no idea of a^ deS Aaahi, you^will note that in the letter from my son Isa, dated 7th Moharram, 1325 (20th’February, 1907), to Sheikh Sagar occurs the sentence (“ Va atlub min jenabekum almosaadeh fi naqz va istebtal-i-hazehel varaqah. ) ^ ( &lt;c And I beg your Honour for assistance in the breaking up and annulling oi this document.”) This shows that the words ^^3 and were used synonymously. Furthermore, when writing to me on the 23rd Moharram with reference to my letter to him (dated 8th Zilhejjeh, 1324) enjoining on him the JlkO^ ^ Hassan used the same form of words as I had, thus : “ You particularly wrote about the deed of contract which I executed w ith Wonckhaus, the German, for the sale of oxide from Abu Musa Island. ^ I understood what you said, namely, that your son Isa was not agreeable to the execution of a docu ment of this purport for the reason that I had not consulted you and that it was necessary that the partners should not enter [into transaction] without the knowledge of the other partners ; that this humble one had entered into this transaction without consultation, and that Isa feared that complications would result owing to the admittance of foreigners [into the concern], and [yGd ^ ^ JlkxLA (“ The annulment of this contract is better than its acceptance.”) Again, in writing to me on 15th Safar, 1325 (30th March, 1907), Hassan suggested that I had better, if I thought fit, write to the German myself and explain to him regarding the annulment of the contract. His precise words were :— ddjliuh JlkO i_Ji? ^ (i7 Job j d It will be seen that he here used Jlkd, and not JlkyLfi. It is clear therefore that Hassan understood me fully in the sense I intended to convey. Secondly, the explanation of the use of the spelling aJuUd is as follows in my opinion :— It is rendering into writing of a colloquial construction of speech. Thus, in conversation, if referring to a masculine object, such as “ zaid,” I should not &gt; sss &gt; S ' s • say but , leaving out the “zamah ” after the “h,” but substi tuting the u zamah ” for “ kasruh ” after the “ t.” Similarly, if I were referring to a feminine object I should not say l^JUUAoT, but &lt;lUUlL-jT, substituting the “ kasrah ” after the “ t ” for the feminine pronoun “ ha.” Likewise, in writing a colloquial letter I should render the above sounds into writing. The word &lt;-_A=d, or &lt;uU-b is constantly used, in my parlance, in reference to a thing in the sense of Alleys. It is also evident from Hassan Samieh’s reply above quoted that he uses it in this sense :— (“ Better than its acceptance,” i.c., better than the acceptance of the contract.) The pronoun is used in the feminine, and could only refer to the contract. A BDUL L ATIF-BIN- ABDURB AH MAN. March 23, 1911.61 Appendix 2G. Letter from Hassan Samieh to Abdul Latif. (After compliments.) _ 23rd Moharrum, 1325 (March 8, 1907). . (), ! r e ^ r Zilbijjeh 1324 reached me in due course, and I was glad to receive it and understand its contents. You particularly wrote about the deed of &lt; ^°, n la ^ which I executed with Wonckhaus, the German, for the sale of oxide from u L usa Island. You said that your son Esa did not agree to the execution of ( ocumeat of such a nature, and complained that I did not consult you, although it was necessary that no partner entered into transactions without the knowledge of the ot ler partners; that I had so entered into transactions without consultation; and that, as Esa feared that complications would result owing to the entry of foreigners into t e matter, the nullification of the contract was better than its acceptance. I under stood it all. Oh ! my brother, at the time I executed the deed of agreement I communicated to you the details of it, copied in Arabic alongside the English without addition or omission, and you came to know of it and approved it, and wrote to me in reply that it was all right. Similarly you asked me for a copy of the deed, and I sent it you, and you acknowledged its receipt and approved of it. It is now a matter of eight months. How can I cancel it ? You, by the grace of God, are a wise man, and if you suggest complications. Remember, the German has no connection with the leasehold of the mines; he has no concern except to take from us the oxide itself, nothing further, for a stated period. There is no harm in this. The object is to effect sales and the stuff be sold whether to him or to any one else. You are aware that he took some from us last year, and we saw nothing objectionable in his deal with us; and, as you know, we have spent a considerable sum of money in expenses in this connection. If we do not sell the stuff how are we to get back our own ? Please God, the matter will end satisfactorily! Salaams to Esa and the brothers. Appendix 27. Esa-bin-Abdul Latif to Sheikh Sacjar-bin-Kalid. (After compliments.) _ 8th Moharrum, 1325 (February 20, 1907). I HAVE to communicate with your honour with reference to the lease which I and two partners acquired from the Government of Shargah relating to the extraction of red oxide from your island of Ahu Musa. As your honour is aware, the document of lease was drawn up in the names of three persons, namely, your humble servant Esa-bin- Abdul Latif, Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Samaiyeh, and Ahdulla-bin-Hassan Samaiyeh. 1 have come to know that on the 1st June, 1906 (8th Rabi-ul-Thani, 1324), the said Haji Hassan entered into a contract with a European merchant named Wonckhaus, without consulting me, and that according to the terms of the document he bound him self and his partners in giving an absolute monopoly for the extraction of the red oxide for a period of four years. And the said Haji Hassan executed this agreement and bound himself without consulting me previous to the drawing of the deed of contract. The details of the said deed have only now reached me, and I do not agree to the terms of this contract. Accordingly I forward to your honour a copy of the deed of contract for you to examine ; kindly look into it. I beg from your honour assistance in taking the necessary steps for the cancellation and annulment of this contract, for I am altogether unwilling to agree to this lease. Previous to this I have written to Haji Hassan Samaiyeh expressing my disagreement to this contract, but he has sent me no answer. Finally, I am obliged to call your attention to the deed of contract, the beginning of which is as follows :— “ Contract between Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Samaiyeh, of Lingah, owner and holder of the Abu Musa Concession, and M. Robert Wonckhaus, of Lingah. ’ [2294/—2] R62 Now Haji Hassan Samaiyeh has no tlfe lelse® &amp;o.; how roSXbt^n ;L P 't to yom honour, and it is for your honour to .ssuo orders. ^ Appendix 28.

Grey considers that His Majesty's Government should accede to the German Government's request on this point, and that it would hardly be dignified to contest it. The oxide already mined has, as you are aware, apparently been damaged by exposure; so that no great The Under Secretary of State, India Office.(45779/11). great commercial advantage would accrue to Messrs. Woenckhaus over British competitors if the whole amount of oxide mined were placed at that firm’s dis posal. Subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State for India, Sir E. Grey accordingly proposes to inform the German Ambassador that the whole of the oxide already mined is at the disposal of Messrs. Woenckhaus, and that immediate instructions are being issued to Colonel Cox to facilitate exportation at the convenience of the German firm.

Your Excellency:- In reply to Your Excellency's Mote No. 31523 of August 12th last I have the honour to state as follows:- According to that Note the Imperial Con sul at Bushire has informed his British colleague that the firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Company of Lingah propose to ship further consignments of iron oxide from the island of Abu-Musa. Meanwhile a com munication on the subject has reached the Foreign Office in Berlin from the Consul at Bushire. The Imperial Consul was previously generally instructed to support the firm of Wonckhaus in shipping iron oxide so long as these shipments consisted of oxide already mined lying partly in the vicinity of the shore, partly near the mines. These instructions correspond to our agreement with His Britannic Majesty's-Government as concluded inin connection with our first memorandum on the sub ject of December 1907. At the time His Britannic Majesty's Government did not concur in our request that influence should be brought to bear on the Sheikh of Shargeh in order that the exploitation of the iron oxide mines might as quickly as possible be allowed again. On the other hand they proposed in their memor andum of January 10th 1908 that the firm of Wonckhaus should be allowed to ship the oxide already mined. Further negotiations then took place in the course of v/hich it was expressly emphasised on our side that shipment of all the oxide lying at Abu Musa should be allowed. By their attitude the Imperial Govern ment met, to a great extent, the wishes of His Britan nic Majesty's Government, being only led to do so on the.assumption that the main point would be settled in a satisfactory manner in the shortest time. His Britannic Majesty's Government on their side informed k us in the Note Verbale of July 14th 1908 of their ans wer to our modified wishes and expressed in the follow ingfollowing unambiguous words the view they then held in regard to the shipment question:- ' the British Resident in the Persian Gulf was instructed on April 9th to make arrangements for transporting all the oxide already mined to the snore, in order that it might he ready for shipment by Messrs. Wonckhaus.' In another place in the same Note Verbale it is stated:- 'There remain on the beach some 400 tons of oxide, and according to the estimation of Hassan Samaigeh, about 3,000 tons of saleable quality near the mines. These amounts are at the disposal of Messrs. Wonckhaus ' The negotiations at that time in regard to this aspect of the matter were brought to a final conclu sion by the above quoted declarations of His Britannic Majesty's Government. As a matter of fact Messrs. Wonckhaus have made several shipments of iron oxide from the island of Aba Musa and in view of the assurance given by His BritannicHis Britannic Majesty’s Government they could reckon on undertaking further shipments at any uime without meeting objections until the exhaustion of the amount already mined. The Imperial Government on their side thought they could assume, after the issue of the general instructions to the British Consul-General in Bushire by His Britan nic Majesty's Government, that the question of separate shipments would easily be settled between the two consu lar authorities on the ground of the understanding arriv ed at at the time, without a fresh discussion between the two Governments being necessary in each case. In view of the above mentioned assurance of His Britannic Majesty’s Government and of the negotiations which preceded it, it is difficult to understand how the idea can have arisen that permission to ship could be issued to Messrs. Wonckhaus only in connection with their contracts and should be to some extent depen dent on the latter. In this connection reference must be made to the German Note of July 26th 1910. Whenpage hen His 1 ritannic Ilajesty’s Government in their com munication of August 22nd 1910 call attention to the fact that in their memorandum of July 10th 1908 they pointed to a connection between shipments and contracts of Hessrs Jonckhaus, the untenability of this point of view is made clear at once from the course of the nego tiations definitely concluded before this memorandum. Moreover the legal position thereby created is express ly confirmed both in the Note Verbale of July 23rd 1908 and in the negotiations conducted in the year 1909. Finally, in paragraph 7 of their communication of August 22nd 1910, His Britannic Majesty's Government themselves admitted, that the view of the Imperial Government v/as in accordance v/ith the text of the agreement reached. According to this explanation of the matter, the Imperial Government consider themselves entitled to expect that further shipments by essrs. ’onckhaus of iron oxide already mined will meet no difficulties in the future. This solution is absolutely equitable as Messrs V/onckhaus have suffered large losses by the stopstoppage of the mines - losses which in consequence of the continuation of the condition of affairs aris ing from the dispute at /hu- uea are perpetually increasing and which entirely exclude the possihility of any ’’unfair” advantage to the firm over British Competitors. In this connection it is necessary to revert to another observation in His Britannic Majesty's Gov ernment's communication of August 22nd 1910, to the effect that in the spring of 1910 some 400 tons of oxide already shipped still remained unsold at Hamburg. Enquiries have shown that this is not a case, as His Britannic Majesty's Government appear to assume, of an excess over the quantity which essrs Wonckhaus were under contract to deliver to other firms; the fact is that this oxide, which formed the greater part of the shipment by the Steamship ''Louise', remained unsold owing to depreciation in value. This depreciation was caused by the fact that owing to the expulsion by the CheikhSheikh of Shargeh of the workmen who had made all pre paration for a fresh shipment, the oxide had to lie foi a long time on the shore and suffered doth in Qual ity and colour 'by being exposed to the weather, espec ially the action of the seawater driven over it by the violent winter storms, so that it was no longer up to sample and was refused acceptance. In consequence of the great interruption in the working of the mines Messrs Wonckhaus have not been able to fulfil their contracts, but have had to repudiate them at a heavy loss. I have been instructed by my Government to request that instructions may be issued in order that the ship ment proposed by Messrs Wonckhaus and any further ship ments, in so far as iron oxide already mined is concern ed, may now be carried out without delay. I am at the same time to give renewed expression to the desire of the Imperial Government that a final solution may soon be found to the Abu- usa dispute and I should be grateful to Your Excellency for an intima tion of when we may expect a reply to our last memoran dum of December 1909. i I have :.mC., (Signed) P.

In his Note of the 26th July 1910 (paragraph 1) enclosed in your letter dated the 2nd August 1910, the German Ambassador repre sented that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. desired “ to ship a further 400 to 500 tons of the oxide,” and this was agreed to in Secretary Sir E. Grey’s reply of the 22nd August 1910. It now appears that the amount actually shipped (so recently as May last) under this autho risation was 300 tons only, and that Messrs. Wonckhaus are desirous of shipping the whole of the oxide remaining over from the heap from which the 300 tons were taken, which they estimate at between 300 and 400 tons.

Since the dispute with the German firm arose in 1SOG, it has always been necessary for me to have a represents tive on the Island while any mining or shipment of oxide has beenbeen in progress. Accounts previous to these I vnxs able to settle out of the prooeeis of the sample shipment of Oxide taken by Messrs. Stride in June 1909, but it will be remem bered that since the dispute began, the rent for the Concess ion formerly drawn by Sheikh Sugar, or Salim, from the island, has been under suspension and although the precautions and repairs connected with which this account is presented have been carried out in the interests of the suit, and therefore in the interests of the Sheikh, nevertheless the latter would certainly not relish having to poy and I would be glad if the Government of India would be pleased to sanction the disbursement of such expenses, incidental uC the course c* the case, from Government funds. them and saying that Government were pleased for the present to disburse these sums, but will reserve to themselves the right to ask him to reimburse them when the Oxide industry is resumed and he is deriving income from it.

Iklr, Tigrane i.ialoolm appaara before me tiiis day 30th May 1911 and maizes the following atatement: The history of my entry into the abu xuusa Oxide concern v^ae as follows I had been for some years connected with the trade in Oxide from Hormuz in association with Hakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh, in whose name the concession then was. He, however, lost the concession and then in consultation vith mo, he set to work to obtain a concession for extracting Abu Musa oxide, having P#1 first made a trial shipment. Xt was i'lakixoda ali who first started the ^bu ^usa mining; Hassan Sameiyeh knew nothing abouti the Oxide trade until Kakhoda Ali introduced him to it. The pi .2 latter had at this time a very bad name with the local author ities and in commercial circles in tho Oulf horts and so he found it convenient to work through uassam Sameiyeh. After securing the Abu i-uisa concession, the parties thought it would be to their advantage to bring me into it with a view to my arranging the shipments to ^urope and else where, and so I came into it. Hakhoda Ali was the moving spirit in the acquiring of the Ooncession, Hassan bameiyeh was only used as a screen. The former was in charge of the minin 6 work and always complained greatly of the obstructive- ness of Abdullah Sameiyeh and his father uassan, and their ignorance of matters connected with the Oxide trade. Owing, however, to his own state of bankruptcy haxhoda ali could not take a prominent part in the concern, and so Abdullah and Hassan gradually began to dominate it; Aakhoda Ali managed, tne work on the Island, I was expected to manage the sales and shipment to hurope, and Hassan acted as corresponding member of the company. Hoknow, on whicn iiiissun waB entitled to act, and tc the best ftc particular basis of authority existed, so far as I of my boiler - (and i have an excellent memory) - 1 have never heard of or seen the so-called Memorandum of Association which you have now shown me. Much lees did I ever sign it or re ceive a copy of it. for was I consulted at all or informed regarding the sale of a share in the concern by Sheikh ba b ar to xusuf bin Abdullah or by xusuf to aassan or has s an to oro.n. It is all news to me. jrf 1. It will be seen that nr .Malcolm state- that it was Nakhoda All and not Hassan who first started the mining work at Abu Musa. A point might be made of this statement when dealing with the barman Argument (page 9 of foreign ufi’ice print) that according to Keligioua Maw, Hassan Samoiyeh, as discoverer of the mine, has an indefeasible right to work them. ^2. Aaxdioda Ali was defaulter and owed lar e sums of money in uushiro and had evaded his obligations by going bankrupt. in any case nassan Sameiyeh never acted according to the Auies now shov/n to me, ae has never rendered any accounts at ail.

M*s Foreign Office $ Ho .1498 to the Government of India \ Bushire of the spring of 1909, when troops had to be landed from His majesty’s Ships for the protection^ of foreigners. * I beg reference to that report from which point my present note^ taxes up the thread. Ht that time (the Summer of 1909) I considered that I had a good deal to complain of in the attitude towards me of the Acting German Consul Herr Wassmuss, and in this view Sir George Barclay fully concurred on seeing papers which I showed him per-; sonally in Teheran; I attributed this mainly to the fact that Herr tfassmuss as a new comer with no knowledge of the country or language, was necessarily in the hands of his Dragoman. Both he, however, and Dr.Listemann, the pxxxx permanent incumbent, placed implicit reliance on the man and neither would hear a word against him. This of course was not unnatural. As will be seen from what follows the man has since been entirely exposed, discredited and summarily dismissed. On the termination of the disturbances and the expulsion of Geyyid murteza, hirza husein gave up his IHtStire to local politics and by judicious bribery among the community of harbour boatmen (his father was a local Hahhoda) got himself elected a member of the Bushire anjuman. Later on in January 1910 he was able to contrive liis selection and that of his ally hirza AliAll aazeruni (sea my report of June 190 m) as candidates (or two of the seats in the i'eheran Majlis allotted to the Gulf Ports. The Governor, however, intervened on tlie ground that the elec tion was not a bona fide one and their deputation never took shape. Meanwhile Mirza ^useir^s operations in arms dealings in assooiation with naji Muhammad nassan, the local broker of ^ Messrs wonckliaus, proceeded as usual but some of the captures^ of arms by His Majesty's Ships were reported to have involved the pair in heavy losses and put them in some financial diffi culty, In March 1910, owing to the stagnation of trade in Bu- shire and other causes, Messrs Wonckhaus withdrew their Euro pean agent tor a time and left the broker naji Muhammad Hasan in charge, ‘rhe jealousy evinced by :_irsa icxxKax Husein at not being given the agency himself, resulted in a split between him and Haji Muhammad Hassan which led to a good deal of mutual recrimination and consequent exposure of their shady business affairs. In September 1910 a sum of £1700 odd which Messrs vVonckhaus had despatched through the medium of naji Muhammad uassan, to the neighbouring coast by sailing boat for the pur chase of grain for export, was lost. I’he money disappeared in transit and suspicion, fostered by ^irza nusein, fell on naji Muhammad, The latter eventually absconded to Tangistan and Mirza Husein was appointed in his place as V/onckhaus* ageht. The firm, however, soon came to the conclusion that Lirza Husein was implicated, and Muhammad nassan more sinned against than sinning, and induced the latter to return from Tangistan. A short time afterwards they preferred a claim on his behalf against Mirza nusein for misappropriating in the broker's absence a cargo of arms which the latter had ordered out. These arms Mirza Gusein is said to have sold to various dealers of whom one Abdul j\arim bought and secreted 10. These arms having been traced and seized, the Director of Gustoms^having obtained proof of their import by Mirza xiusein, toox up the case against him with the Governor and tne German Consulate. At the same time the GermanGerman firm convinced their Consul of -irza nusoin’s dishonest behaviour in connection with the disappearance of the £1700 and the defalcations of uaji xiuhammad aaeaan, with the result that br•Listemann at last decided to dismiss his retainer* To this end hr.trumpeter, hessrs Wonokhaus* then agent, armed with a letter Irom the uerman Consul intimating his dismissal and En closing his pay to date, proceeded with the Consul *s authority to the Mirza* s house with the intention fif arresting him or seizing certain important documents wnioh he was believed to hold* Mirza husein, however, escaped by a bacjs: door and took ^bast” with a local Mullah. Monsieur Constant, the Belgian Provincial Director of Customs, dushire, about this time received instructions from a©heran to report to his Administration concerning the case against Mirza iiusein and informed my Commercial Adviser, Mr. Chick, of the purport of a telegraphic report wnich he had sent towards the latter part of liar oh, which was to this effect, viz: 'herr trumpeter had been deputed by the German Consul to ’’hand mirza nusein a letter of dismissal and the salary due M to him. The Mirza took to flight, realising that he had H been unmasked and convicted of extensive robberies on the 'German Firm'. “ uirza Husain is now spending large sums of money in order ‘*to procure false evidence from tne Mullahs • u Mirza Husein has long since been known to the Customs as “an importer of arms and is at the moment being prosecuted by **the Customs for smuggling 10 rifles and in this connection the ff Governor of uuahire has informed me that 'Mirza Husain had sent “him 150 tomans as a bribe. He, Mirza Husein, was now haggling “as to the amount of fine which he should be called upon to pay. ^Mirza Husain is an agitator and a rogue whose downfall will be ^welcome by all honest members of the community'. Charges against Mirza nusein are still pending and meanhhile the German Consul is withholding the rent of the German Consulate premises(i9V premiaes, which belong to .lirza tiusein, in connection with hie debt to tliQ dornian firm. Lastly his hx old friends of the spring of 1909 have since turned against him and recently got up an extensive round-robin (signed among others by his Nationalist accomplice Lirza Ali nazeruni) in which they accused him of being Seyyed Lurteza* s instigator and evil genius and demanded that he should be made to disgorge or refund the money which he had prompted Seyyid ilurteza to plunder from the Government Customs. It &gt;vill be seen that Lirza ^usein has been thoroughly dis credited; denounced by the Local eovernment; prosecuted by the Customs and the German firm for dishonesty and summarily dis missed from his post in the German Consulate. I submit that we have ample grounds to mention in our reply to the German Rejoinder that since the penning of it they must admit that the Dragoman upon whose integrity they relied, has been proved to be a thorough rogue and that they will appreciate our inability to place reliance on his statements. uieut-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.British Residency in the Persian Gulf.

When at headquarters I am subject to incessant interruption and I have only been able to complete the report by coming for a few days to the Shat-el-Arab and working in quiet on the 'Lawrence*. The German Rejoinder was a formidable document if read by it self, but when studied by the light of the papers already record V ..; , ed a great deal of the substance fell out of it and I have seen no reason to alter the apprisement which I made of it in En closure (1) to ray Note of February 19th 1910 submitted to H.M*s Foreign Office.

Sir, Your moot obedient servant.BRIEF COMMENT IN SUMMARY OP THE FRESH ARGUMENTS AND EVIDENCE NOW SUBMITTED. It seems unnecessary to do more than take up the thread from the point where it was left by my Note submitted to H.M*s Foreign Office on 12th February 1910, to which I beg reference. The Issues' referred to below are those framed in that note. Issue (a) (l) The right to jotsam and flotsam It is shown by documentary and testamentary evidence that ,in the Gulf the right is levied by the local inhabit ants and their overlord, if he can ; and sees fit to. do so, takes his share. It is shown also that no one but the Ruling Sheikh has been recognised in this connection, but that he (Sagar) in virtue of the arrangement by which he allowed Salim the income of Abu Musa, has left the levy to him. (P) The rejected version of the Oxide Concession dated 6th April 1898 is shown to have been drafted by Abdullah bin Hasan Samaiyeh himself, and to have been rejected by Abdul Latif specifically on account of the unwarrantable claim therein put into Salim’s mouth, of formal ownership. The final version of the Concession was then drafted by Abdul Latif himself. (3). What the German Note calls 'revenue from mother-of- pearl' and canary seed' is shown to be a mistranslation. It should be 'ground rent from storage of ’muhar* and *zinni’ oyster-shells'. The ’muhar* and ’zinni’ are two species of pearl*.bearing shells. The word for canary seed^ ’kazni’jis somewhat like ’zinni*. Sheikh Sagar specifically allowed this to go to Salim as part of the income of the Island.(joy (4). The Mica Leaae* Was given with the Ruling Sheikh’s knowledge and consent and Sheikh Salim was allowed to take proceeds as part of revenue of island* It proved to be a mare’s nest and fizzled out. Salim’s enjoyment of the income of the Island, with the consent and subject to the pleasure of the Ruling Sheikh is not disputed. I may mention here for the information of Governments Jt has been considered unnecessary to mention it in the evidence - that a change has come about in the relations between Sheikh Sagar and Salim. Sheikh Sagar’s son Khaled, Sheikh of Rao-el-Khaima, having died of consumptlo^, Sacrar cent nis uncle Salim there temporarily to take charge as Deputy Governor• Soon after his arrival there his son committed a murder in con nection with a love-affair. Sheikh Sagar wanting to have the murderer tried and punished, Se3?m in order to save his son set himself up adversely to Sheikh Sagar and placed himself on the defensive. It being the pearlingV^ Season and all his men away. Sheikh Sagar took no punitive action and eventually made terms with Salim and allowed him to xaiKiai* remain as Sheikh of Ras-el-Khaima. He has accordingly ceased to pay hin any pension and withdrawn Abu Musa from his enjoyment. I do not think we need mention this as the development is still fresh and had better be left to crystallize quietly. Issue (b). A quantity of similar evidence has been obtained in refutation of the merchantile and clerical evidence fur- niched in the German Rejoinder. Issue (c). The Memorandum of Association proves never to have been completed or even s.een by the other partners - and never to have been acted upon. Hasan himself claimed (to Abdul Latif) to be entitled to act on it,nor even mentioned it in hie remonstrances. As an authority in Hasan's hands it did not exist. We concede that, Hasan uptoupto a certain point was managing partner, but thia monopoly contract was a new departure, beyond his powers. Issue (d). Requires no fresh evidence. It is further argued. Issue (e). Important evidence has been produced in the chape of Malcolm’s deed of partnership corroborated by a letter of Hasan Samaiyeh, showing that Hasan himsolf drew up and in- sorted a prohibition against the sale by any partner of any share without the express consent and signature of the other partners. In the case of his purchaeo of Yusuf’s share and transfer to Brown, he neglected to comply with this condition it is tLoroioru invalidated in any case by his own provision. Issue (f). Is combated. No evidence is needed. May 27th 1911.^ ' REMARKS ON THE GERMAN EXPOSITION OF THOSE FACTS IN THE CASE WHICH, THEY CONSIDER, ARE NOT DISPUTED BY EITHER PARTY O0O-- (1) SHEIKH SAGAR AT THE ?I f! E INTENDED TO DRIVE SHEIKH SALIM Yes; indirectly prevented. Sheikh Sagar was reminded by the British Resident that the principles of the Maritime Truce ap= plied to the Islands, and was informed that he must not let his quarrel with his uncle lead to a disturbance of it. Sheikh Salim was given pacific advice of a like nature. But for his fear of our displeasure it would obviously have been a simple matter had for Sheikh Sagar, who at that time ^11 his tribesmen at his lowing with him at the time or means of defending himself. But the British Political authorities know by experience that ii these Arab Sheikhs are allowed to send armed tribesmen to sea in boats, their followers inevitably get out of hand and pro bably start firing on or looting innocent craft, and thus dis turb the Maritime Truce generally. We have in consequence been obliged to make it an invariable rule, not to agree to the passage by sea of dhows full of armed men, unless It be with the express consent of the Resident and in the presence if necessary of one of H.M'e Ships. As a matter of fact it would probably have saved a good deal of subsequent trouble in this case, had the Resident allowed Sheikh Sagar to take what steps he pleased against Sheikh Salim, merely sending a ship to the spot to make sure,that, apart from their quarrel, there should be no disturbance of the general peace. Such, it will OUT OF ABU MUSA BY FORCE BUT ^AS PREVENTED FROM DOING SO BY TPV BRITISH RESIDE:; T IN THE PERSIAN GULF be remembered, was the course pursued when Sheikh Sagar evicted Hasan-I'i’' ' Hasan Samaiyeh’e workmen in October 1907, H.M.S. 'Lapwing* being deputed to see that no lawlessness occurred; but in 1883, the fact probably was that the Resident had no ship at his disposal at the moment and therefore took the next best course he could, namely to sterilize the dispute by strictly warning both parties that they must not break the Maritime Truce. But because Sheikh Sagar loyally bowed to the British Representative^ wishes in this direction he can not reasonably be thereby held to have forfeited rights which he possessed as ruling Sheikh and which he could have made good but for our action* Were it to be contended that Sheikh Salim acquired Abu Musa under such conditions, it would be equivalent to saying that he had been made a present of it by the British Government! (2) . THE REVENUE FROM THE ISLAND OF SIR ABU NUAIR , SAID TO AMOUNT TO 200 DOLLARS, VAS ALSO ASSIGNED TO SALIM. I would rather say 'expected to bring in' than 'said to amount to'. (3) . SON OF THE BRITISH CONSULAR AGENT AT SHARGAH. Residency Agent not Consular Agent. (4) ThE R3VT VAS P^ 7 D REGULARLY • BY SHFIYH SALIM# Rent was admittedly received by Sheikh Salim whon &gt;&gt;hfcikh Sagar allowed to keep whatever revenue came in from the island. (F). THIS SHARE WAS, ON THE 10th OCTOBER 1907 SOLD BY HASAN SAMAIY H TO THOMAS BROWN, A BRITISH SUBJECT. On 10th October 1907. That is 8 months after the^can-^ cellation of the concession. (It will be shown later on/that Hasan by his own admission had no right to sell this share). (6). 2000 TO 5000 TONS OF RED OXIDE WERE TO BE DELIVERED TO WONCKHAUS ANNUALLY FOR FOUR YEARS FROM THE MINES ON ABU MUSA. THE COMPANY HAD A L SO CO NT RA C T ED WI T H A N 0 T H i R PARTY TO DELIVE 400 TONS A YEAR FOR FIVE YEARS xO INDIA. This is a misleading representation of the facts. Except for a quantity of 2000 tons which Hasan had already contracted to supply to another party, at the rate of 400 tons per annum, ^onckhausWonckhaus acquired an absolute monopoly of the output for four yearn and a preferential right to renew at the end of it* (7)* THE OSTENSIBLE GROUND FOR THIS STEP IS A OOMPLAIJT LADE BY ISA TO THE! SHAIKH THAT THE CONTRACT FOR DELIVERY OF RED OXID^ HAD BEEN MADE WITH WONG 'HAUS WITHOUT HIS SANCTION. It was both his interests and those of lea bin Abdul Latif which formed the ^ostensible ground* 1 for Sheikh Sagar*s action* (See also item 7 of British Memorandum). The Sheikh gave his own reasons for withdrawing the concession; they were, that Hasan had given a monopoly which he had no authority to do and had thus made it evident to the Sheikh that his own rights over Abu Musa might be endangered by the continuance of the conces sion in such unsafe hands. He in fact realised that Hasan was acting in a way calculated to prejudice his interests, and in his laterTetter of 26th March to Hasan (Annex 16 of First German Memorandum) in reply to Hasan’s protests, he explained himself in further. He said he had concurred/the original concession be cause all the parties were British subjects and thus every one concerned was under his own control or that of the British Go vernment; but he objected to the admission into the concern of the subjects of a foreign power over whom he would have no the, ^ , control. He feared that^mines might go out of his possession: and it is clear that the apprehension was not altogether an empty one, for in their letter to the Sheikh dated 13th October * 1907 Messrs. Wonckhaus wrote **We have paid to them (Hasan etc) very considerable advances x x x and we consider that the oxide lying on the sea-shore is our property and that the m ines and the concession are security for the said advances**. Again, when Messrs. Wonckhaus* employe. Brown, attempted to land at Abu Musa on 22nd October 1907 with Haji All Tashankar and a number of men from Lingah, and was prevented by the resolute attitude of the Sheikh’s guards, he was reported by Lieutenant Gabriel to have had with him a German flag which he intended to erect at the Oxide mine or over the accumulated mineral.(jvy. ^ Lastly when Dr. Listemann, Consul for Germany at Buehire,ad dressed SheUch Sagar direct on 19th November 1907, protesting at his action, he wrote that Messrs. Wonckhaus having purchased a share in the Mining Comapny, now had a 'Madkhal' (means of entry) directly into the working of the mines. Messrs. Won ckhaus 1 s claims and action were obviously calculated to bring the Sheikh up against the provisions of the Treaty of March 6th 1892 with the British Government(See also Item 68). The grounds of complaint advanced by Esa bin Abdul Latif were briefly (i) the grant by Hasan of a monopoly which he had no authority to grant (ii) Hasan^ failure to consult his partners (iii) the fact of Hasan signing himself as 'Owner and holder' of the Concession. (8) SHEIKH SAGAR Ofl 3RD OCTOBER 190? AGAIN ORDERED THAT THE WORK SHOULD CEASE. The words 'and that he should remove his coolies and gear within 10 days' might be added# (9) . THEREUPON ABOUT 20TH OCTOBER October', Aftef'20th/the words 'Hasan having taken no notice of his warning' might suitably be inserted. (10) . THE BOATS CONTAINING THE SHEIKH'S ARMED FORCE ’/ERE TOWED TO ABU MUSA BY THE BRITISH WARSHIP 'LAPWING'. The reasons which made it expedient that one of His j gg-^y * s Ships and a representative of the Residency should be present were explained in Count 4 of the British Memorandum- but vide also item (l) above. (11) . TWO EMPLOYES OF THE FIRM OF ROBERT WONCKHAUS 8c CO: X X W’:RF RECEIVED WITH BULLETS BY THE SHEIKH'S ARMED MEN AND FORCED TO TURN BACK. The said employes had no business to be where they were. It was only after they had persistently Ignored repeated shouts of warning that some shots were fired over their heads. Mr. Brown /was also one of the parties, is a British subject, and would doubtless have complained to the Residency if he had thought he had any legitimate ground for so doing. Re hasPOSITION OF SHEIKH SAGAH WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY OF LESSEES FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF PRIVATE LAW. -~«oOo-~.~ (1J ‘ W hat the British Memorandum said was: 'Salim declares that in granting the lease of 1898, he merely acted as proxy i or the Ruling Sheikh, then absent on pilgrimage to Mecca. the lease of 1898 in the capacity of owner but in that of oalim himself wrote : 'When I leased the mines of Abu Musa I was officiating on your behalf and the Concession was given by proxy for you; and I was well aware that on your return from the pilgrimage to Mecca, if you considered my action in the matter of the concession was good, you would confim what I had agreed to, and if in your opinion it was objectionable you could ahnul it, either at the time, or at any other time'. It will be seen later on in these papers that the grant in some capacity by Sheikh Salim in December 1898, of a Concession for exploiting 'Mica' in Abu Musa, has to be ad mitted. (It was never reported to the Residency and came to nothing)* At the time of its grant Sheikh Sagar had returned from his pilgrimage and states that he was consulted by Sheikh Salim and approved of the grant. But he - Sheikh Sagar-being present, we cannot maintain in this case that the Concession was granted by Sheikh Salim as Regent. The natural explanation is this. Sheikh Salim admittedly was allowed to reside in the island as tenant and enjoy the produce, subject always to his own loyal behaviour and to x x It thus appears that Salim did not conclude Regent x x xthe vdll and pleasure of Sheikh Sagar. In the case of the Oxide Concession the position would be that Salim gave the concession after obtaining the concurrence of himself as Regent and subject to Sheikh Sagar^s confirmation* In the case oi 'Mica w Concession he gave it after consulting Sheikh Sagar who was himself present. As regards Sheikh Sagar's letter of 11th October 1902 to the British Resident. His statement that Salim granted the Concession 'as Regent' would still stand so far as it went, and the motive of its assertion is quite an intelligent one and quite different to the far-feti^ched one that the German Rejoinder seeks to put on it. They say that being under the mistaken belief that he was prohibited by the Treaty of 1892 from entering into such transaction with any one but a Brit ish subject, and Nakhoda All being a Persian subject, he was anxious to persuade Oolonel Kemball that Nakhoda All was not a Concessionaire at all and that if there had been any fault it was Salim’s and not his. The only basis for this view is a garbled version of a remark said to have been dropped by Sheikh Sagar, and there is no real foundation for the hypothesis at all. To go back to the letter itself and Colonel Kemball’e let ter to which it is a reply. I would explain that business with the Trucial Chiefs is carried on almost entirely through the Residency Agent. Direct letters between the Resident and the Sheikhs are of comparatively rare occurence, and when they are necessary the Resident’s letters are always sent to the Agent under flying seal (or accompanied by a copy for the Agent’s record) for delivery. Similarly the Sheikh’s reply addressed to the Resident direct is gtoven to the Agent to close and forward. No Sheikh would think of answering a letter of the nature of this one (Colonel Kemball’s) without consulting the Agent before replying. In this particular case too, Sheikh Sagar knew that the Agent himself was per sonally and financially interested and consulted him fully■ - (\$) 1 as to the terms in which he had best reply, m proof of this we have the fact the Sagar f s letter, above quoted, is found to oe written on the Agentts office paper bearing the Go vernment of India Water-mark* It is obvious that unless Sheikh Sagar wanted to quarrel with Abdul Latif, the answer must be what the latter wanted and advised, and what Sheikh ogar said to the Resident, in other words, was:- 'What you have heard about the Abu Musa Oxide Concession being in the hands of Nakhoda Ali, of whom I know you have a bad opinion, is not true; the Concessionaires are three of your own people and I supposed your Agent had given you the necessary details of it. In case you may notice that the Con cession was executed by Salim and not by me, I would explain that Salim granted it with full powers as Regent for me, during my absence at Mecca, and it is still operative, and has my support - so I hope you will not think it necessary to make any difficulties about it'. His object was not to disclaim responsibility at all, but on the contrary to make it clear to Colonel Kemball that the Concession was in order and had his own approval* as far as we were concerned As a matter of factethere was ]/ no ban.whatever against Na khoda Ali, qua Persian subject. The position at the time in this regard is set forth in Item 26 following* (13) . SHE Ii dl SAGAR INCREASED THIS ALLOWANCE BX THE REVENUE OP ABU MUSA, INCLUDING THAT DERIVED PROM THE RED OXIDE MINES. This statement is correct# (14) . MEMORANDUM OF SHEIKH SAGAR, DATED 22ND PEBRUARY 1898. This is a ol-ciical error. It should, of course, be 1903. (15) . ATTENTION MUST BE CALLED TO AN INACCURACY IN THE TEXT OP THE BRITISH MEMORANDUM. There is no such inaccuracy. What Sheikh Sagar stated vTast (Annex 5 of British Memorandum). ' I have absolutely not given any deed in connection with the IslandOijj) £ 'Island, rcr in regard to th© mines thereof, all I did was to 'relinquish the income to him, in the way of financial 'assistance x x x'. There was no stipulation or mention that the income to be left for Salim was to be restricted to that of the mines* This was obviously not the case because Sheikh Salim was also allowed to enjoy the fees for landing and storing Muhar and Zinni Oyster shells for export. (Vide Annex 5 British Memoraiidum). Also see Annex 1 British Memorandum, in which Salim writes ; 'You were kind enough to place Abu Musa under my supervision, so that I might cultivate there in and reap from it the means of subsistence'. The position no doubt was that Sheikh Sagar relinquished to Salim all revenue that might accrue from the Island, so long as Salim did not importune him for money and so long as the income did not become so considerable as to be more than Sagar’s interests could allow him to relinquish or Salim could expect to receive. SALIM TO ABBIAH SAGAK, DaTAD THE 21st F^itiJAhY 1908. The reasons of the German Government for this attitude are that the letter was written at the time the case was in progress and that I, Major Cox, was at Shargah just at that time. This is a very convenient way of disposing of a dif ficult piece of evidence, but this argument, I hope, can be resisted. Obviously there was no reason for Salim to write such a letter until he learnt of the way in which his name was being used and of the claims on Abu Musa Island with which he was being credited. The argument of the German Government in regard to the ob jectionability of the evidence to this document would apply to a number of the annexes to their rejoinder. Although they bear each other no affection at heart, the two ShelJths have been quite of one mind in regard to the If British Memorandum). (16). TO ACCEPT ; behaviour of Haean Samaiyeh and the expediency of with.-drawing the conceseion and if it had not been withdrawn by Sheiidi Sagar it would have been withdrawn by Sheikh Salim. any In^/case Sheikh Salim absolutely adheres to what he then wrote* (Note. - His own letter was read over to him in the presence of myself and the Residency Agents of Lingah and Shargah and he said he absolutely adhered to it). ). THjS SHElnH' S LdiTTKRS TO THH HRITISH RESIDENT IN 1884 (ANNEX 3 &amp; 4 OF THE BRITISH EEMORAi^DUM ) ARE NO EVI- DEl^OE OF SACrAR'S OV/NERSHIR OF THE I8LMD. The arguments used in support of this statement seem to be a good deal laboured. The position was,clearly^as stated under item 12 above. Sheikh Sagar had just been created Ruling Sheikh by the voice of the tribe, who were tired of Sheikh Salim: Sagar was obviously in a very strong position and able to turn Salim out of Abu Musa if he had a free hand, but the Re sident told him that if in doing so he broke the Maritime Truce he would be suppressed. Sheikh Eagar replied with a good deal of force; 'If you do not want us to fight, please remove Salim from the island yourself; if you find it in convenient to do that then leave us to settle the matter and do not call me to account if we fight. At least,if ies you will not let me proceed to extremit-r/with him make him give a written undertaking, guaranteed by you, that he will behave himself, so that I need not bother about him'. I think any one reading Sheikh Sagans letters under reference would regard them, especially that of Fbbruary 14th 1884, as not only having in mind the need to preserve the Maritime Truce and put an end to the political conflict, but also as intended to form a specific assertion of his right of ownership as Ruling Sheikh, and so to safeguard himself against any prejudice to that right which might sterilisiog otherwise result from the Kesident’s esei-AiRg a&amp;tion. ABU(lip (18) • ABU liU S A IS OUR ISLARD AND A DEFER DANCY OF SHARGAH. we Cannot spare it to others*; I gather from the observations made under this head and from the italicising of the word ff oui’* , ,that from the fact that the transaction Quotes Sheikh Sagar as using the plural pronoun in referonce to himself, it is sought to deduce that Sheikh Sagar was not referring to himself but meant'we w i, ” the JowaBim ,, ,and only intended to claim that Abu Musa belonged politically to the territory of Shargah or the Jowasim. Whether or not this was the case cannot at all events be determined from the use or misuse of the pronoun. Generally when writing formal letters these Sheikhs use the this plural pronoun in reference to themselves. In instance I find, on reference to the original, that it is the trans lator of 1884 who is responsible for the use of both forms in the^translation. In the original Arabic the plural pro noun is used throughout both letters. With reference to the German arguments on this point. It is to be noted that when Sagar uses the plural pronoun they argue that by doing so he intended to chow that he was not referring to himself but to the Shargah State or the Jowasimj while when Salim uses it (vide page 6 of Eng lish version of German rejoinder) and speaks of 'our island' they say he meant 'my island' l I grstfit that there is no significance in the use, either way, and that both Sheikhs probably meant 'our'(Jowasmi) Island, vested in the Ruling Sheikh.

THOSE LETTERS THEN HAVING NOTHING TO DO V/ITII THE QUESTION OH PRIVATE OWNERSHIP* I am inclinod to agree* According to my view there is, and can be, no private ownership of the island. Salim might conceivably own property on it, but if he did, he would have title deeds for that propety. The facts are that when Ruling Sheikh he built a house and planted some date trees. When he ceased to be Ruling Sheikh he ceased to own these except by his successor’s favour. If Sheikh Sagar evicted him from Abu Musa he might choose to recom pense Salim for his expenditure and trouble while tenanting the island, or he might not.( 3 ee Annex 1 and Item 28). (?]).

Colonel Kemball*s letter (No.75 of 10th March 1902) ran as follows;- you wish 'A report has reached me that :£Ekx&lt;xxx to grant a Con cession to Haji Nakhoda All Ahmed Saleh for excavating and exporting red oxide from the island of Sir Bu Nuair.

The pointed suggestion in the German reply that we had reason for not producing the letter, inclines me to suppose that they have seen it. Tills is quite possible. At the time the letter was written there was no German element connected with the Concession, and Sheikhs Sagar and Salim, Abdul Latif, and Hasan Samaiyoh, were all in each other*s confidence, and the Resident’s enquiry and Sheikh Sagar*s reply would have been of interest to and probably discussed by all of them. I am not sure of the reason which prompted Government not to produce this document, but I should presume it to be this: Nakhoda Ali was a Persian subject but no objection was then on that ground raised by the Residency A to his participation,, The Germans might argue that if Sheikh Sagar had in 1898 granted a Con cession to a foreign subject, and we had not objected for 4 years, why should Sheikh Sagar object,as he now has; or we; to the entry of Wonckhaus into the concern. As a matter of fact Colonel Kemball was mistaken. Nakhoda Ali was not a sharer in the original Concession, his name was dropped for a specific reason# As a fraudulent bankrupt he was a disreputable person and incidentally, over i whom neither the Sheikh nor Government had any ultimate control. I do not quite see what we have to lose by producing this letter*seeing that the position then was as explained in Item 26.

( r&gt; ) THIS INTERPRETATION lb EVIDENTLY ERRONEOUS AS IT GIVES THE TREaTY A AEANING v/iilOii w'OULL ^jE INCOMPATIBLE WITn THE OPEI^ DOOR. It may be a matter of opinion whether the theory,that Article 3 of the Treaty of 6th March 1892 precludes the grant of a mining Concession to a foreigner, is compatible with the principle of the open door, but that question hardly the time when Sheikh Sagar addressed arises here because at th ■ —1 higIk his letter of 11th October 1902 to Colonel cembali the only warning he had received on the subject was that contained in Colonel Meade's letter to the Residency Agent, bhargah, dated 17th February 1900 in which the former wrote:~ 'You should inform the Trucial Chiefs separately that ”the Resident would be ready to help them with advice in ’’respect to any proposals made to them for trading pri vileges, such as mining concessions, etc. In doing so 'you would, of course, malie it clear to the Chiefs that w the Resident has no desire to interfere but it would be 'to their advantage to obtain advice before concluding 'arrangements for monopolies and exclusive privileges, 'thereby protecting themselves against unscrupulous 'traders'. The whole object of this advice was to protect these unsophisticated Sheikhs against all unscrupulous persons anxious to exploit their ignorance, whether British of Foreign - by urging them always to consult the Residency before entertaining applications for concessions. It is true that later on (vide Foreign Department 3177- E.B., dated 27th August 1907) I ias instructed to w warn the Trucial Chiefs that the grant of a concession of any sort to mine or otherwise exploit any portion of their territory is considered to fall within the scope of this clause for the time being,and action, pending tho settlement of Residency Agent not to entertain applications from out siders for mining rights without consulting the Residency. For explanation of Sheikh Sa b ar's letter see under item 1$. this case, was limited to a reminder to the Sheikhs by the ( 2? ) A OVuR THAT AMOUNT The word 'little' has been intorpolatedjln the arable it/'wa siyadeh' i.e. ' i.e. 'and over' or 'and more'. TO Sh (ilVEd TO SHEIAHbHuIIivH vVOULD IT WOT WAVE BbEn WAi'UiiAL TO GIVE HIM THAT OF THE I3LAWD CF ABU MUOA ? The status of Sir Abu Nuair and Abu Musa Islands in re lation to the Ruling Sheikh of Shargah -vere precisely the same, rhe simple reason why Sheiidi Sa^ar did not at that time intimate the ^rant of the revenue of Abu Musa to Salim in lieu of a cash payment, was, that that liiand then brought in no specific revenue. The fact was that the interest which (e.g.Annex I) Salim had taken in the place as Ruling Chief A and the money he spent in endeavouring to cultivate it had all come to nothing, by reason of the failure of the water supply. Thus, addressing the Resident on 9th Zilkaadeh 1297 (14th October 1880) the Residency Agent wrote that according to what he had heard from the Ruler of Shargah -(then Sheikh Salim) - regarding Abu Musa - 'Its water has altogether become salt and the trees have died away. lA e does not get anything from the place, not even a gaz - (small copper coin) 1 *. So the reason why the income of Abu Musa was not mentioned is obvious.(See also Item 35). (oq ) SALIM HAS ALWAYS EXERCISED THE RIGHT TO WRECKAGE OR ABU MUSA. These petty potentates of the Gulf littoral do not con cern themselves with abstract attibutes of sovereignty, and in tracts where no postal or telegraphic communications exist and effective administrative control, according tc our ideas, is lacking, practice is necessarily conflicting with to theory. The right jetsam and flotsam is exercised on the basis of'ialght is right' The local inhabitants exact levies it when they can and the Sheikh of the principality BSsatM or foregoes his royalty as his inclination and ability may dictate. Abundant testimony to this effect is forthcoming. She cases connected with the Island of Abu Aisa quoted in the German argument were never reported to the Residency, as an amicable MiiiwcaKi solution was arrived at locally. 1 have no reason to doubt the facts, but may mont-on ^(g£&gt; ' /6 Annex connection with the first case quoted, and German ^gfawcsrKiuir No*6, that Salim was at that time acting as Regent so that he might have been kx&amp;hbxh writing as Ruling Sheikh. He admittedly shared the proceeds of wreckage with the inhabi tants of the island for the time being - migrants from the Shargah suburb of idian for the most part and thus full sub jects of the Ruling Sheikh of Shargah - but he exercised this right in virtue of the dispensation from Sagar which permitted him to enjoy the produce of the island - vide Hheixh Sagar^ statement in Annex ( o ). As far as the Residency is con cerned we have always, as a matter of course, recognised the position of the Ruling Sheikh in the matter. Thus, on 17th May 1894, the Residency Agent, Shargah, reported the wreck of a Bahrein boat on Abu Musa and its de tention by the inhabitants thereof pending payment of half the value (Annex 3 ). It will be seen that it was* 1 the Sheikh of Shargah' that the Chief of Bahrein proceeded to entreat, (Annex 4 A 5). and'the Sheikh of Shargah' fthora the Residency recognised. A Again the in the case of the stranding of the B.I.S.N. Co * s S.S.'Buliraba' on the Island ( Annex 6 ) it is clearly the 'Sheikh of Shargah' whose position and responsibility were recognised. As a matter of fact, under Article 4 of the Treaty of 6th February 1806 with Sheikh Sultan bin Sagar, father of Salim and grandfather of Sagar, the »Jowasim^ are not entitled to exercise their right in the case of British craft&gt;but in practice the incident ha^^app^ned and has been adjusted by has local understanding before any news of it/transpired. incidence On the general question of the of the right, and in regard thereto, the position and practice A I offer the following evidence:- (i) Copy of a letter dated 1st March 1905 addressed by me to the Assistant Resident, Bunder Abbas, in reply to an enquiry on the subject (Annex 7 )• (ii) Translation of Sheikh Sagar's own explanation of the position of himself and Sheikh Salim in reference to this qusstion.question.(Annex 2).

ON THE OTHER HMD THE FIRST AGREEMENT CONTAINS THE PAS SAGE 'SOLONG AS I, MY CHILDREN AND MY BROTHERS LIVE NO ONE SHALL HAVE A RIGHT TO RAISE OBJECTION TO IT. ,, Regarding thie rejected draft see Sheikh Sagar's observations (Annex 2) and Abdul Latif’s Note (Annex 11)* II wi21 be remarked that the draft was written by Abdullah bin Hasan Samalyeh. It was all very well for Abdullah cunningly to put such words into Sheikh Salim's mouth, but Salim knew well enough that he was not in a position to make such a pronouncement and the draft was rejected specifically on that account. Directly Abdul T.wtff saw it, he said that it would not do and wrote out an amended draft omitting the objectionable words. Until I showed it to him a few weeks ago, Sheikh Sagar had never seen or heard of lt * The cautious Abdul Latif also realised that the admission of Nakhoda All into the original agreement with the Sheikh, which would have to be reported to the Residency, was inexpedient as he had a bad reputation and was disapproved of by the Reside ncy, and his inclusion would probably be objected to. . His name was therefore omitted from the original agreement and it was decided to bring him in on a subsidiary agreement between the partners inter se. (It is very evident from all that has transpired how very much these two ignorant Arab Sheikhs were in the hands of the more sophisticated people with whom they were dealing and how very necessary it is for us to look after their interests in such matters). IN THE DOCUMENT OF 19TH AUGUST 1898 XXX SHEIKH SAGAR X X EXPRESSLY UNDERTAKES TO PAY A PROPORTIONAL PART OF THE mother of pearl due. this is absolutely inconsistent with SAGAR-S ASSERTION THAT HE HAD GRANTED TO SALIM ONLY THE,RENT.. eP THEjmDEJffiiSS AND AT THE SAME TIME SHOWS THAT SALIM HAD A m ™ tjto nww NAME OF ALL SOURCES OF RIGHT TO THE ENJOYMENT IN HIS OJI NAMli ur T0 BE DERIVED PROFIT FROM ABU MUSAkUSA, AiMD THAT CotJLD AXAHGISk THIS HIHHT HVH1M AS AGAINST THE REIGNING SHHIxii. / It has not been contended that Sheikh Sagar granted only the rent of the Oxide Mines, (see Item 15). It was perfectly natural for Sheikh Sagar, entering this commercial concern as a private individual, on the same terms as the others, to share the payment of the ground rent. He would naturally have been debited with this share even if he had been taking the rent himself. Sheikh Salim the private .

( 1 may mention for the information of Government, that the Residency Agent ^bdul Latif, made whatever no report.of it, either at the time of its execution A and or at any other time; and during the progress of/discussions regarding this case he can only be regarded as having de signedly suppressed all mention of it. ni s excuse that the project fizzled out and that he consequently did not think it worth reporting, cannot be taken seriously.) So far as Sheikh Sagar is concerned 1 have no doubt that, the Concession never having been taken up, and a decade having elapsed since it died a natural death, he had really forgotten all about l Ft. 19c &amp;is is not at all surprising with such feckless people V as tnese Sheikhs,who keep no records and live in the present. I believe the history of the so called H Mica' project is this.The Captain of one of Messrs Strick’s steamers which took a consignment of Oxide from Abu Musa, mistook some thin strata of gypsum, which is common on the island, for Mica; told the Oxide Ooncessionaires that it was valuable and ad- visad them to gat^oontract'S it.

It will be noted that no signatures are given on the Annex in question, for the reason that the document was never signed up, and the Memorandum was never accepted nor became operative. For further details on the subject of this Memorandum of Association, see Abdul Latif*s statement (Annex 12 ) and Item 60 of this Report. All the original documents are in my possession. (34 ) IN TliJ DOCUMENT RELABIVE TO TTiE AIC A MIjmES THERE IS ALSO A STIPULATION OF IMPORTANCE TO THE EFFECT THAT THE LESSEES AND THLIh EMPLOYES MAY CUT DOWN aveSIUESHUE TREES BUT NO OTHER TREES. THIS PROVISION TOO IS EVIDENCE THAT SALIM DISPOSES OF THE ISLAND AS Ow’NER. The Heshkeshuh is a desert shrub used for burning. Firewood is a great difficulty on these barren islands, and if no express stipulation had been made there would have been a danger of the concessionaires’ coolies indenting on the date palms or other garden trees which Salim had tried to grow. This stipulation is no evidence that Galim dis- nosod of the Island as owner. He was admittedly the tenant allowed and settler and was ««***}»* to enjoy the produce as long as he was allowad to occupy that position.(s^P *1 ■ (35 ) AMOTHiiH DOCUMnAJl* ..iilCH 13 OF 11-POETICS AS 7 Oim TEA QUBSTIOK OF O^NKRSiilP x x x IS TEA L3TTFE AD- DRASSAD BY THE BRITISH ASSET ilBDUL LATIF TO HASAR SAMAIH OR THE 12th NOVSiviBSR 1898 x x x ABDUL LATIF JR ITES J Teat a DIsputa HAS /.RISER BST.vAEE SALIM AND SAaAR IN REGAeD to sir.

Abdul Latif’s note on tho subject (Annex 13 ) ex plains the position fully and his explanation i s corroborated by also papers already filed with the case and is A con- firmed by our records. Abdul Latif had no hesitation about Abu Musa because Sagar had admittedly, in connection with the Oxide Con cession, allowed Salim to enjoy what income he could get out of the Island, but in the case of Sir there was no longer such an arrangement. The agreement of 1884 had been re- and . . vised^another agreement (1889) executed, in which mention of Sir had been eliminated. So until the two Sheikhs came to an understanding nothing could be done. In effect^Salim said to Sagar: 'You gave maa the revenue of Sir because it was supposed to bring in 200 ^d. but you never made it up to me when it did not; now that there is some chance of getting some income from it you wonH let me have it' . replied . x Sagar 9 &amp;X&amp; to Salim: 'The agreement (1884) under which I I let you have the produce of sir, lapsed, and in the exist— us ing instrument between A the income of that island ££ is no longer included; meanwhile I have since resigned to you the income of Abu Musa which is quite enough for you and I am not prepared to give you that oi Sir as well.

(Gee also Annexes 14 and 15). (iii) Was a petty merchant - always in a state of bank ruptcy and receiving help from Hasan Saraaiyeh. He recently died insolvent. (Annexes 8,9, A 10) In refutation of the above I produce statements A to an entirely contrary effect from various and important Arab Sheikhs of the littoral, most of them of the same stock as the Chiefs of the Trucial Coast. They belong to the category of Maritime Arabs who up to comparatively recent years possessed and ruled the littoral on both shores of the Gulf. Their whole history has been bound up with the Coast and Islands of the Gulf and their views must necessarily be of the greatest weight. It will be seen that they are unanimous in the opinion that Ab^P^land is the property of the Ruling Chief of Shargah. * * IT CANNOT BE QUESTIONED THAT HE EXCERCISFD WITH THE CONSENT OF THE REIGNING SHEIKH AND EVEN AS AGAINST HIM THE FULL RIGHT OF DISPOSAL OF THE USUFRUCT JUST LIKE AN OWNER - ET SEQUITUR itIt is admitted that as tenant he enjoyed the usufruct subject to the consent of the reigning Sheikh, but not 'as against' the latter, except qua private individual and in so far as Sagar as Ruling Sheikh consented. We concede that in the case the of Mica concession Salim was not acting as Regent, but was then acting in consultation with Sagar and with his concurrence. The English view is, not that 'Sakar is the owner of the Oxide mines' but that the Ruling Sheikh of Shargah owns them, and Sakar occupies that position at present^gee items 31 &amp;32). ' SAaAR HAD NO RIGHT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW 0? PRIVATE LAW TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT OF HIS OWN MOTIOf. ' In this matter the Ruling Sheikh is a law unto himself - When he cancelled the concession he was dealing with persons subject to no jurisdiction but his own and that of the British Government and was entitled to act as he pleased to the extent to which the latter Government choose to acquiesce as regards their subjects. The British Government considered his action warranted under the circumstances and declined to intervene in behalf of their subject. TO THE LESSEES AND SECURE IT (THE ESPECIALLY ABDUL LATIF THEREFORE WISHED CONCESSION) FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE ACCORDINGLY THE STIPULATION OF A DEFINITE TERM OF YEARS WAS OMITTED IN THE SECOND AGREEMENT. In view of the terms of the first and rejected agreement argument it is difficult to maintain the BTSW&amp;y&amp;xb adopted in Clause 2 of our first memorandum of July 10th 1908 or avoid the conclu sion that the omission of the specified period was made by concessionaires in their own interests. Having regard to the fact that Abdul Latif drafted the agreement in its final form and that the right of the Concessionaires to use the mines as as long as they wished, was provided for in both versions, it can hardly be said that the time limit was omitted in the second instrument simply to safeguard the lessor's inter ests. I think the best line for us to take on this point is that it is difficult to gauge the exact motive which promptedprompted the omission, but if it was the one suggested by the German Memorandum, and if the Oxide business was then, as they say, considered very profitable; and if it was intended oy the lessees to bind the lessors permanently, in return for a nominal rent of £ 20 per annum, then there was obvious ly all the more reason for Sagar to put his foot down and can cel the Concession and for us to support him in so doing* In omitting this time limit apocatarkkaco: the astute con cessionaires thoroughly over-reached themselves for it is clear from the abundant testimony of Mullahs and merchants now forthcoming, that even if the lease were not revocable on any other grounds, it was rendered invalid both in clerical and merchantile law, on account of this very omission of any time limit. For the rest, the mere fact that Concession No* 1 was rejected, shows that the irrevocability claimed was at any rate only comparative and not absolute. SEE HAS BEii Uh !'Q EARN MONET AND THE RENT DOES NOT APPEAR SUFFICIENT TO HIM, SAXAR, IS ONE THAT CANNOT BE DISCUSSED This was a reason or a part reason suggested by His Majesty*s Government and not given by the Sheikh himself / but it is a very natural one. He and Sheikh Salim knew no'3 2 $ I append a separate note (Annex ^4 ) regarding the identity of the merchants and clergy mentioned in the German Rejoinder, from which it will be seen that the merchants quoted are by no means leading merchants, and that there are good grounds for regarding their testimony with suspicion; while the clergy are certainly not the 'most important' nor compare in repute with some of those whose opinions I now produce* (42). AhL THE OPINIONS COME PRACTICALLY TO THE SAME CONCLUSION XXX ACCORDING TO COEMFRCIAL LAW THE LEASE AGREEMENT IS VALID; THE LESSOR CANNOT TERMINATE IT. As I have mentioned above the Commercial Evidence given in the German Rejoinder is in my opinion impugnable and in any case entitled to no weight. The German firm have evident ly had recourse to, or introduced to their Consul, not 'lead ing merchants', as they suggestion persons whose opinions are of any value, but just a particular clique ol individuals in Lingah who are notoriously hostile to British interests and influence. In refutation of this evidence, I bring forward the opinions of 11 representative merchants ( Annexes 17 and 18,), from different parts of the littoral all of whom express the view that the lease is invalid according to the Commercial Law of Islam, because it lacks both specification o± period and is devoid of any record of the pronunciation of the pro posal and acceptance formulae, considered to be a necessary feature of such documents. 13). ACCORDING TO RELIoImPL 1 THE LEAoL AGUE'.MENT lb IN VALID X x x. BUT ANY PERSON VfHO DISCOVERS OR WORKS THE MIKES THEHEBY ACQUIRES IKS RIGHT TO EXPLOIT THEL XXX. HA3AH S Ail An eh OR THE COMPAHY OF LESSEES HAS BY WORKING THE HINES ACQUIRED A RIGHT EG in-i-. I submit a quantity of weighty testimony from numerous members of the Clergy including the Chief Priests of Lingah and Bushire, both Sunni and Shiah (Annexes 19 to 23 *. /—V They3 / \Vt) *'£&gt; They are unanimouo In the opinion that the lease agreement iv invalid for several specific reasons - e.g*; (i) Non-pronunciation and record of the usual formula of proposal and acceptance* (ii) Non-specification of period, (iii) Jon-specification of the amount of profit to be de rived by the lessee. It will be seen that two separate questions were put to the Clergy, (Annexes 59 , S1 &amp; 23 ). In the first place : (A) As to the validity of the document according to Shara Law; Th !dmittedT rd8! thS inVall&lt;i;Uy of the document having been ( B(i) Ship ' ; is to the right of the lessor to cancel it and eject the lessee, and resume the control of his property. The consensus of these opinions entirely supports the view that the lease was invalid and that the lessor of the pro perty is entitled to cancel the lease and resume his pro perty. I would esnecially point to the opinions recorded by Abdarrahman bin Abdul Ghafoor El Mufti who has a very high reputation among the inhabitants of the littoral and islands. As regards the clerical contention, relied on in the German rejoinder, viz, that in Islam mines are the common property of all Mohammedans and that anybody who works them has thereby acquired an indefeasible right to them. The clergy of Islam may continue in the abstract to cherish this ancient and chimerical tenet, which had its origin in the interested aim of the Muhammedan hierarchy to keep matters concerning mines and the exploitation of minerals in their own control, but no one can pay serious attention to such an exploded claim at the present day, much less contemplate giving effect to it in practice. It seems waste of time to discuss it. The conclusion to be drawn from the opinions now pro duced is that the lease was bad in law, whether commercial orx® *7 or religious; that Sheikh Sagar or Sheikh Salim (they were both of one mlnd^so it matters not which) had the right to cancel it and eject the lessees; and that it ceased to be operative from the moment it was cancelled. I may record the personal view that the cancellation by a Ruling Sheikh of a concession granted to British subjects is not a matter which we should allow to be decided by a round robin of re corded views either of merchants or clergy and that I regard both as mere padding. As however the German claimants have had recourse to it, we produce similar stuff in refutation. (44). THE SAbE TO FOREIGNERS IS NOT A BREACH OP THE AGREEMENT. No. It was not suggested that the sale of oxide to foreigners was a breach of the agreement - but the grant of a monopoly to a person not under the control of the Sheikh or ourselves was in the opinion of the Sheikh a breach of the understanding on which the concession was granted.B REMARKS OH THE GERMAN EXPOSITION OP THE POSITION OP SHEIKH SAGAR WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY OP LESSEES PROM POINT OP VIEW OF PUBLIC LAW.

THE BRITISH MEMORANDUM FURTHER REMARKS THAT THE PRINCI- PAL OBJECT OF LAKAR WAS TO ADMINISTER JUSTICE, AS BETWEEN THE PARTNERS OP THE COMPANY 'ON THE STRENGTH OF HIS SOVEREIGN RIGHTS OF JURISDICTION* » The above is a misquotation. What we said was that Sheikh Sagar cancelled the lease on the strength of his sovereign lights of jurisdiction. We went on to express the view that his principal motive was the desire to administer justice between the partners and render nagatory the unauthorised quite action of Hasan Samaiyeh. This has not/the same bearing as the German quotation of us. (46). COULD THE SHEIKH CANCEL THE LEASE AGREEMENT BY A JUDICIAL DECISION? X X A JUDGMENT CAN ONLY BE GIVEN BY A JUDGE APPOINTED BY A SOVEREIGN. This dispute will not be solved by reference to abstract principles of Muhammedan law, to which not the slightest attention is paid locally. All these Arab Rulers, the Sultan of Muscat, the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast, Bahrein, Ko~ weit etc., administer justice themselves, only referring to the Shera points which obviously concern them. Although the German Government are pleased to consider it surprising, it seems a very natural thing to us, in a case which primarily concerns only the Sheikh and three British subjects, to allow the Sheikh as Ruling Chief to take r© take ouch measureo aa A may see fit to regulate the matter, with what we consider is due regard to the interests of our BUbjecte. But he has not given a .Judicial decision 1 between the P artne rn (vide Items 48 &amp; 66 ). «oiBiou A oetween (4,). HA 6 SAH SAMAIH BESIDES NOT IN SHARGAH BUT AT LINGAH IN PERSIAN TERRITORY AND THEREFORE IN THE JUDICIAL DIS TRICT OF THE BRITISH CONSULATE GENERAL AT BUSHIRE. In bringing forward this argument the German Govern ment renew the attempt which they made before to bring the dispute away from the Jurisdiction of the Government of India and the Resident in the Persian Gulf, into the sphere of the Consulate General at Bushire and His Majesty's Lega tion at Tehran. The point is an important one, and it is v-ry necesoary for ue to maintain our present attitude in regard to it. The actual document was executed at Shargah and the partial reason for the inclusion of Esa bin Abdul Latif in the concession was in order that one of the concessionaires might reside at his headquarters and so be in touch with the Sheikh. It is a pure accident that the Samaiyehs, who are of Bahrein origin, happen to live at Lingah. They might equally well be residing at Bahrein or Koweit. Abu Musa appertains not to Lingah or Persia but to the Truclal Coast and to the jurisdiction of the British representative at Bushire in his capacity of political officer accredited by the Government of India to the Sheikhs and principalities of the Arab Coast and Islands of the Gulf. As I urged in my note of February 12th 1910, as long as we deal with the matter as one concerning the Government of India’s Residency jurisdiction, we are in a much stronger position to lay down what the Sheikh, who is a law unto himself, can do and can be permitted to do. I may mention that in the case of a current claim on the part of Hasan Samaiyeh for compensation for loss of gear alleged to have disappeared from Abu Musa, I was careful when holding the enquiry to take all the parties over to Abu Musa and make themake the investigation there in the of Shargah’s representative. 03&gt; 30 presence of the Sheikh (48). IT STILL REMAINS TO CONSIDER » FURTHER QUESTION WHETHER HIS DECISION. I.E. CANCELLING OP THE LEASE AGREE MENT AND WITHDRAWAL OF THE MINES WAS IN ITSELF LEGALLY AD MISSIBLE. Thi^ io a question concerning the Sheikh and the British authorities only. The British Government hold that the Sheikh's action was fully Justified by the circumstances. The Sheikh and the Government of India were prevented from going further and making any adjustment beNteen the three concessionaires inter se by the ill-advised action of two of them in attempting to drag in the German firm and Go vernment. When the matter is allowed to take its natural course it may be possible to regulate matters as between the concessionaires. The legality of Hasan’s action was- a matter for the Sheikh and the Government of India to decide. If Messrs. Wonckhaus* commercial interests were prejudiced by Hasan’s action it was for him to seek commercial relief in the usual way. This argument has all been stated before and it seems superfluous for me to go over the ground again. (49). X X THE (BRITISH) MEMORANDUM STARTS FROM THE ASSUMPTION THAT HASSAN SAMAIH'S PROCEEDINGS WERE CULPABLE. Yes this is so. The German quotation which follows, of the argument of the British memorandum^is not a quite a correct one. The argument of the British memorandum was that H there is nothing in the documents in possession of His Majesty’s Government to indicate that Hasan Samaiyeh occupied the post of the Managing partner and that there was every reason to believe that in any case any authority he had did not extend to the grant of such a contract as this (which tiedtied the hands of the Company for an indefinite period) ' without first consulting the partners. (50). fHI? IMPERIAL QOVERJIMEST,HOWEVER, MAINTAIN THAT THE. K-iRMERS DID AS A MATTER OP FACT, SANCTION THE AGREEMENT BETV not HA3SAW SAMAIH amd w °nokhaus, but this sanction ■ —/R. -.L. I NEC;AsoARY AS HASSAN SAMAIH IS THE MANAGER OF the company. Our reply to this has been (i) that Hasan is proved to have deliberately misled the partners as to the nature of the contract and withheld the test from them, and (ii) that their sanction was necessary# Hasan had nothing else to work on by way of authority than the conditions laid down in the document admitting Nakhoda Ali to partnership (Enclosure 2 to First German Me morandum). it is shown in Item ( 3 S), that the Memorandum of Association (Annex(l4) of German Rejoinder), was never signed up and never became operative and that the concern was being worked on the conditions prescribed in Inclosure 2 above-mentioned. Furthermore it will be noted that Hasan Samaiyeh never attempted to contend that he was under no obligation to con sul t the partners, but that he had consulted them and that they had approved - the Tact being that when communicating with them he had deliberately withheld the text and the im portant feature in the contract to which he knew perfectly well they would object. His letters to Nejef (Annexes 24 to27] show clearly that on ordinary occasions he did feel under the obligation to consult the partners and that Nejef de murred to his failure to do so in this case. • II’ lb DISPUTED TKAY NEJEP WAS A PARTNER. X X THIS PARTNERSHIP WAS CONNECTED WITH PERSONAL SER VICES AND THEREFORE GEARED WHEN THE SERVICES GAME TO AN END. ♦ This conclusion is not demonstrated by the documents quoted. The(nV The aubaidiary deed admitting Nakhoda All as a partner in the expenditure and proflte of the Company makea no such suggestion but on the contrary clearly places Nakhoda All (among the partners inter se) in precisely the same position as his fellows. Nor can the question, or rather the answer, be begged from the disingenuous query and suggestion made xn Abdul Latif’s letter to Hasan of 85rd June 1905 (German .'nncx 3H). Abdxil Latif himself states that Had'an’s reply to that letter indicated that they did ^ recognise Nejef and that he therefore dropped the suggestion.

Reliance can neither be placed on the statements of Abdullah bin Hasan nor on those of the then Dragoman of the Imperial German Vice-Consulate (since dismissed). As regards the declaration of the British subject Brown that Nejef expressed approval of the contract and offered to sell his share, this being a retraction of what he stated in his petition to Lieutenant Gabriel on 16th February 1908-, I can only say that the statements which Mr. Brown understood him to make must be regarded as having been retracted by the affidavit subsequently recorded before Major Trevor. (Annexe 31 &amp; 32 ). It can hardly be doubted that,had he been so inclined, Nejef would have been Induced both to part with bin „ ha to arSin the Company, and to give a written acquiescence to the “ contract with Wonckhaus; not that from our point of view either the one transaction or the other would have been of any value when obtained months after the concession had been cancelled, (oee also Inclosure 18 of Fir 04 Rr-i-n v ivirvu British Memorandum) 54 .

Mr * Mal colm as a matter of fact did complain that Hasan haa entered into the contract without consulting him and had refused to give him a copy of the document - vide his letters of (i) August 23rd 1906 and 17th October 1906 in cluded in papers submitted by me on 1st March 1908. He then asked my advice as to what course he should take, but i said I could express no opinion without seeing his deed of partnership. This he was then unable to produce* Mr* Malcolm is almost stone blind and at that time had just got rid ol his Persian Clerk and was consequently unable to find any of the papers bearing on the precise terms of his partnership in the Company. It was for this reason, namely that we had not seen his papers, that the British Memorandum only referred so briefly to his connection with the concern. He has since found the deed of partnership and I now ap pend a translation of it (Annex 33 ). It proves of con siderable importance and shows that his position, like that of Nakhoda Ali, was one of absolute equality among the partners inter se. (55). NO DOUBT HASLAN SAMA IK OUGHT HOT TO HAVE MADE USE OF THE EXCUSE THAT THE AGREEMENT WAS IN GERMAN. After making this casual observation the German rejoinder goes on to endeavour to explain away or belittle Hassan Samaiyeh’s tactics in concealing the text of the contract fromfrom the knowledge of his partners. They were demonstrated sufficiently clearly in the summary of Hasan's correspond ence submitted by me with the material for our first Memo randum on 1 st March 1908 and under Item 7 of that Memorandum Them can be no aoubt of Hasan Samaiyeh's sustained endea vours, all through, to suppress the plain fact of the mono poly or so to gloze over it that it would not be noticed. While the German argument here makes out that it was only Malcolm (as a possible rival in his capacity of Strick's Agent) whom Hasan wanted to keep in the dark, it would ap pear from Hasan's letter to Malcolm dated October 14th 1906 that it was in reality Abdul Latif from whom he was anxious to conceal the terms of the contract, for he wrote to Mai- colra *In truth it is not my intention that any ono should come 'to know about it except myself and you' .(-Enclosure 14 British Memorandum)• The reasons for his perseverance in withholding from Abdul Latif the precise terms of the contract were obvious. He had been repeatedly warned by'Abdul Latif that while there was no objection to the mere sale of the stuff to any body, he should not commit himself to any deed or formal contract without consulting him, and he (Hasan) knew well enough that both the execution and the terms of the document in which he had bound himself would be objected to by Abdul Latif directly he saw them. To discount this opposition from Abdul Latif his obvious course was to postpone the delivery of the copy and the objections of Abdul Latif as long as possible, so that he oould then plead that the contract had been in operation now to such an extent that it was impossible to go back on it. This is precisely the line he took. Thus^ writing to Malcolm on 9th May 1907 ho said 'A long period has elapsed since I made the contract with the German, and I have been engaged in doing the work,our labourers have beenM s' been working there and heavy expenses have been incurred x They did not make any objection all the time'! That the e3! ' eCUtion of 3Uch an instrument was incompatible v/i'h Abdul Latif'e repeated injunctions and Hsan's own pro- ation.. i. clearly demonstrated by the correspondence submitted on 1st March 1908. Among the latter I would point to Hasan's letters of 30th January 1905 and 5th July 1906, which did not form enclosures to the previous memorandum presented to the German Government* (56). . K3 (ilALCOLH) FUHTHER EXPRESSLY STATES : 'IF WE ARE NOT SURE OF GETTING A HIGHER PRICE WE SHALL NOT GET THE FORMER AGREEMENT CANCELLED”. Mr. Malcolm did not favour me with a copy of this letter and the line of argument or persuasion used therein is un fortunate but it will be noted that it was written In reply to Hasan* s letter to him dated 14-th October 1906 (Enclosure No. 14 of British Memorandum), and after Malcolm , s communi cations to me on the subject of Hasan*s intrigues with the German firm and his refusal to supply a copy of the Contract (vide his letters to me referred to in Item (54) above). The object oi the missive was simply to allay Hasan’s suspicions and induce him to send a copy of the contract, and I sup pose Mr. Malcolm worded it in the terms most likely in his opinion to have the desired result. (57). V/'KEJf MALCOLM LATER ON RECEIVED A COPY OF THE AGREEMENT Hf SAID NO MORE ABOUT IT AND ACCORDINGLY ACQUIESCED IN IT. It will be seen from his letter to me that he did not acquiesce, but by the time he got the copy (not till De cember) I had also then got one and he was awaiting informal advice from me as to what action he should take. I could give him none because he had not produced his deed of part nership. I think we might say that Malcolm did protest to the Residency both at the conclusion of the contract without his being consulted and at the refusal of Hasan to supply him withWtth a copy “ but that bein g unable at the time to find his deed of partnership there was nothing on which he could base a formal complaint against Hasan. (P8)# ' ' COaRESPOMDEHOB SHOW AMWL LATX9 AGH2ED TO THIS. Neither Abdul Latif nor any one else had any objection to the mere sale of the stuff to Messrs. Wonckhaus. All Abuul Latif f s expressions of approval were made in ignorance of the precise toxt and bearing of the contract and in the belief (a natural one after his repeated admonitions) that nothing more than a sale of the mineral had been agreed upon. (59). XT IS HOt TILL tOOf FOUR MONTHS LATER THAT ABDULATIF X BEvaS KASfJAN TO SEND HIM A COPY OF THE AGREE MENT. For the simple reason that up to now Abdul Latif had trusted to Hasan’s good faith but had now received news which aroused his apprehensions, namely that Hasan had granted a monopoly and bound himself for a number of years. (60) • HI (ABDALLATXF) GOES OH TO OAi t l BETTER TO TRY TO CANCEL THE AGREEMENT THAN TO DJ AS HE (TEE GERMAN)WISHES' x X X x X TilE BRITISH MEMORANDUM TRANSLATES THE PAS SAGE IN QUESTION AS FOLLOWS: ' THE NULLIFICATION OF THIS AGREEMENT IS BETTER THAN ITS ACCEPTANCE'. In the German Memoranda a great deal of argument has been based on the wording of this passage translated in the sense which they contend should be attributed to it. In support of their version they quote the opinions firstly of a young American Missionary of Busreh, and secondly of a German Professor of Berlin. Both opinions are theoretical and conjectural and do not profess to pay any regard to local usage. In refutation of them I bring forward, (i) A statement from Abdul Latif that what he meant was 'the annulment of this contract is better than its 'acceptance'; (Annex 34). I 4-(ii) Proof that Hasan Pamaiyeh understood him in that sense and requoted his words back to him but more grammatically and unmistakeably;(Annex 34 ). (iii) The opinion of the well known Missionary the Revd* S.M. Zwemer, who has laboured for some 15 years among the Arabs of the Gulf and probably knows their local pecularities of speech and writing better than any living man. He has no hesitation in saying that the meaning intended, and the natural interpretation to place upon the sentence is 'The annulment of this 'contract is better than its acceptance'. (Annex 35 ). ahls collective testimony disposes of the arguments which the Germans have based on the forced interpretation which they sought to pla ce i on the words. ^ translation 'compliance .,ith the German s wishes was quite a second thought (vide enclosure 8 cl 1 st Grrr.an Memorandum). (61 ). THE FA0$3 GIT 77 ' SHOW THAT NSJEF X X X X AP ; ELL iiS MALCOLM AND AB DULL AT IF DECLARED TiiEIR APPROVAL OF THE CONCLUSION OF THE AGREEMENT. We contend that after seeing the text of the agreement having none of them approved of it - such approval as was expressed^ been induced by the deliberate suppression of facts by Hasan* (62). THE MEMORANDUM OF ASSOCIATION AMD THE EXTENT OF HAGAN•S POWERS TO ACT FOR THE PARTNERS* The answer to the arguments on this point is that the document quoted as Annex 14 of the German Rejoinder is not a completed document and bears no signatures. It was not ac cepted by Abdul Latif and was never completed or signed up. It has never been seen by Sheikh Sagar, Malcolm or Nejef and has never been quoted or acted upon by any of the parties,, and no accounts have ever been rendered by Hasan All Samaiyeh as would have been required had it been operative. (Annexes 40 &amp;42). I append a statement by Abdul Latif on the subject (AN- nex 12 ) and would also refer to the statement of Isa bin Abdul Latif datedl?th Muharram 1326 (=20th January 1908) forming— (mW, s c iorraing an enclosure to my letter of 1st March laosT'' Esa and Abdul Latif have never suggested that Hasan was not the managing partner for the sale of the oxide 'with the knowledge of all”. which But this deed/granted a monopoly for a number of years to Tonckhaus, was a new and radical departure from the practice of the past; it was clearly a privilege which it was not within Hasan’s competence to grant without consulting his partners and by his tactics in endeavouring to keep the terms of the document secret from his partners Hasan showed that he knew very well that he had acted ultra vires and that they 7 /ould object as soon as they understood the effect of the document. The ground for Esa’s action was (vide his letter of 20th February 1907 to Sheikh Sagar) that ”Hasan Samaiyeh has no ^ deed of authority from me giving him any general power in regard to the action which he might take respecting the lease etc.”. Nor had he. His conduct of affairs e.g. his refusal to render any accounts, his inclination to ignore his partners and his readiness to buy up their shares, warrant the con jecture adumbrated by Nakhoda Ali (Annexe^to A ) that hi s aim was to tire out,or to buy out, the others and get the con cern into his own hands. (63). X X HS, -VALOO: C-XISD HOT DC ANYTHING- A: THOUGH HE WAS A FARTHEH, BECAUSE AN IHDIViDUAi- PARTNER HAD U0 RIGHT TO ACT T. X X X IT OjULE WOT BE STATED MORE DISTINCTLY THAT HAS AD SilLAIB IS THE MANAGING PARTNER. I attach a copy of an affidavit made by Mr. Malcolm which explains his attitude towards the concern and towardgi clear Hasan Samaiyeh# It is that he did, in pp&amp;ctica , treat Hasan as Managing partner, up to a certain point.(Annex 40). In this regard generally I would observe that fhe British Memorandum said no more than that there xxa were no docu ments in their possession to indicate that Hasan was Managing partner. Other documents, such as Malcolm's deed of partnership (annexQd 3Q (Annex 33 ) are now lerthcoming ^iiich show that Hasan did act as managing partner for tho ordinary sale of oxide 1 ’’with the knowledge of all w , but that does not alter the * fact that his execution of his exclusive contract with Wonckhaus and the terms of that contract were both ultra vires, he had no authority to warrant such a step. (64). IT APPEARS FPOh TKh BOOKS OB Til 7 .’ GOlfFAMl tiMIC KEPT VERY NEATLY, CLEAhhY ANl; ELL. In this case it is the more curious that Hasan should h^'w© persistently neglected to furnish any accounts to his partners and should always have put them off with vague promises that he would soon make them up. There is good reason to believe from the reports of the Residency Agent Lingah at the time that these nicely kept accounts were concocted by Abdullah and Brown at Lingah (Enclosure to Residency letter No. 909 of 21st March 1908 to India). (65) . HASAN SAMAIYSH WAS THE COMPANY WHEN HE ACTING ENTIRELY IN ILE CONCLUDED THE AGREEMENT INTERESTS OF I A UOKOKJIAUS. If he thought this and thought they would approve, where was the need for secrecy and prevarications (66). ABBOi Dll 0 . : • n CNB SB HD THERE Vikiy NO LKGr/J^ uROUND FOR SHEIKH SAKAR TO GIVE ANY JUDICIAL DECISION UNRAVOUPABLF, 70 RAMAN AAE AIR. It is not contended that Sheikh Sakar has given a judicial decision as between the partners. He merely exer cised the right which he enjoys , as a law unto himself in regard to his own territory, by cancelling a concession in what he believed to be ^ the interests of the partners and himself. (See also Items 46 &amp; 48). As soon as the German Government has ceased endeavour ing to drag the matter into the realm of politics, such measures as are necessary in order to arrive at an adjust ment of interests or claims among the concessionaires, who are all British subjects will become possible. This is purely a matter concerning the Sheikh and ourselves.(67) ‘ 2- HE I EASE AQRHMmr OF His'OW' MOTION 'IT T^n,; r^vw'pp-.y,- 00UNTHY? X x II&lt; THE 3'IiiiS-. ^LACE IT IS WOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND HOY THE AGREEJ'.TNT OF THE 1ST JUNE 190E CAN BE REGARDED AS A LETTING OF TEE MINES TO MR£ Y'ONCKH/'Ur . Stress cannot be laid on the precise bearing of the par ticular English word used. Remember it is a question of the translation of a vernacular word. In th^lt is the word used by Esa, Sheikh Sagar and Abdul Latif in reference to the document passed to Mr. Wonckhaus. The word is 'Ijareh' ) or 'Ijar tf ( j\&gt;\ ), the latter being merely a contaction of the former. The 7 /ord has a much more elastic signification than our word 'lease'. It includes 'hire' - 'rent' - 'farm' - 'a privilege or income of variable amount sold or let for a fixed sum”. Similarly 'Ijareh-dar' ( ) in Persian and its equivalent 'Mustajir' ( jr it-) in Arabic = 'A farmer or renter of land or revenue' - 'a lease-holder' - 'a monopolist' - 'a hirer'. Perhaps'farm* would be more ap- a propriate than 'let' or 'lease' in the present case. y-^ We are indebted to First German Memorandum Enr.^ a nd The reason why the persons above-mentioned have applied this term 'Ijar' to the instrument in this case and have not merely called it a 'contract' or 'deed of sale' is plain from their letters (e,g, enclosure 12 of First German Memorandum and 17 of British Memorandum^- namely that the deed granted a monopoly and left the partners no power of control of the output or modification of the contract, 7 r ag thus an' I jar'. ( 68 )• SAKAll’s FEAR THAT THE AGREEMENT LAY LEAD NOT ONLY TO THE PROPERTY IN THE MINES BEING GRADUALLY LOST TO THE OPENER X X X X BUT EVEN TO THE SEPARATION OF TH^ ISLAND OF ABU MUSA FROM SHARDAH, IS SO SENSELESS THAT IT IS REALLY NOT WORTH WHILE TO DISCUSS IT X X X X IT0$ / IT IS X ALSO STRAFGS THAT X X SHEIKH. 3 AKAR SHOULD WISH BRITISH SUBJECTS TO SE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FRO' THOSE OF OTHER ?0TF!3. ohc-ikh o^gar a Q-pprohensions are not so baseless in practice is they seem to be to the German Government in ti eery. These Arab Sheikhs have no speedy means of com- , , possessions municaoion v:ith their outlying A , no men-of-war to cruise and keep an eye on them. A 3 late as 1904 sheikh Sagar was put to a great deal of anxiety and inconvenience because an over-zealous Belgian Director of Customs,anxious to make history^went over to the Island in a Persian Customs steamer and hauled down his flag, hoisting the Persian flag instead. The British Government which protects these Sheikhs in re gard to their external affairs speedily took the matter up and had it righted to the Sheikh’s satisfaction, but the in cident naturally gave him a fright and made him. suspicious. The action of the German firm and German representatives in this case has certainly not been calculated to allay those suspicions. Although in the arguments adduced in this case they have repeatedly declared that the contract en^tered into by Po.Su.r* was simply a sale of oxide by Hasan and a purchase of oxide on delivery by Wonckhaus, yet their conduct to wards the Sheikh has shewn him clearly how readily a very different complexion is introduced^iA 0 the transact!on« Thus (i) On 13th October 1907 Messrs. Wonckhaus wrote to Sheikh Sagar : 'We consider the mines and the concession for them as 'a security for the advances paid. If you force Haji ’’Hassan bin Ali Somayah &amp; Co: to withdraw their ” coolies and representative, we shall have to send n over some men ourselves to protect our property'. (Consul Bunder Abbas to Government of India, Wo. C/47, dated 25th October 1907). (ii) On PC th October 1907, Lieutenant Gabriel, Assistant Resident Bunder Abbas reported : 'The local representative of Wonokhaus, Mr. Brown and 'about 26 men left for the island on October 22nd.(69). ’A German flag which he intended to place on the accumu. Nation of oxide was also taken'. ( Consul Bunder Abbas to Government m , No. - dated the 28th October 1907 ). InQla ’ Telegram (iii). on 19th November 1907 - addressing Sheikh Sagar direct, the German Vice Consul, Bushire, threatened the Sheikh with a claim of a lakh of rupees and claimed for Messrs, ffonckhaus the right of direct entry (or concern) in the working of the mines. “• 755 10 InS1 * ' M “'“ -“-I (iv)„ On 16th March 1909 - Hasan Samaiyeh, no doubt under advice from his German supporters, wrote a threat- ©ning letter to Sheikh Sagar in which he said s~ All the oxide mines which are on the Abu Musa belong tn w' 2 ,r.K 0a “ *” oo„trol b ^ U f„ ta (Residency Letter No. 1559 dated 4th July 1909 to India). As regards the apparent differentiation between British subjects and other foreigners, I would explains The British Government are as anxious to protect these unsophisticated Arab Sheikhs against unfair exploitation by .^ri^sh^subjects just as much as other foreigners, but from the Sheikhs* point of view it is very natural that they should re gard Br^uish subjects in a different light to other foreigners. They know that British subjects if not fjubject to their own jurisdiction are subject to that of the British political authorities with whom they are united hy close ties of treaty and obligation. They trust to the British Government to keep their own subjects in hand and give tkxm the Sheikhs immunity from worry or imposition. They have no such guarantee in the case of other foreigners, neither under the complete control of themselves nor of the protecting power. Even Hasan Samaiyeh^until it suited his book to change his ideas, had strong views on that point and at one time was all against the admission into the concern of any foreigner, (vide Annex 41 and following Item).( 69 ).

LATTER• Apart fro® what we have already maintained namely that the conceneion had already ceased to exist for 8 months when Brown went through a form of purchase of Sheikh Sagar’s the fact share; and jst&amp;xwx evident A (Vide enclosure 11 of First German Memorandum and other papers) that when he went into that previous transaction he had full knowledge of the A cancellation of the Concession^ ~ ' tWo now have the text of the deed of partnership admitting (Annex 33), inclusion Abdullah bln Malcolm A and thethereln / in^Hasan*s at** handwriting, of the express condition that 'it is not open 'to any one of the partners to sell his share or to admit 'any one therein except in consultation with Haji Hasan 'bin Ali Samaiyeh and with his signature together with 'those of the partners'. This again is emphasized in Hasan’s letter on the subject to Abdul Latif (Annex ^ )• It would be quite open to us to argue from this emphatic condition, brought into operation on 13th Shaaban 1316 = 27th December 1898 -, that the sale by Sheikh Sagar of hxs share to Yusuf bin Abdullah a month later (17th Ramzan 1316 = 3 n th January 1399) was invalid because it did not bear (jf) the signature of any of the partners - and that the sale of the same share by Yusuf to Hasan on 15th Shaaban 1318 - 8 th December 1900, was doubly illegal* * (Enclosure 4 C to First German Memorandum). In this connection the bearing of the letter of Hasan Samaiyeh to Abdul Latif of 7th January 1900 is particularly important. It will be seen that it was specifically in connection with the Yusuf Abdullah Share, then in the mar ket, that Hasan introduced the prohibition against any partner selling his share or admitting an outsider without consulting him and all the partners. He congratulates Abdul Latif \GCpAA Abdul Latif for preventing Yusuf from soiling the share to a foreigner and gayR _ye are better entitled to take the share and it wji th^n fo to 'Uie partners • Yoo/’iUistanding this he very soon afterwards, bought Yusuf•s share himself, and refrained in connection therewith from fulfilling the necessary condition which he himself had made but a few months xg® before. Neither the signature of Esa, nor Malcolm, nor Nakhoda All, was taken on the trans fer; and no one heard anything about it until Hasan went somewhat out of his way to inform the Residency Agent, Lin- gah, of the fact in October 1906, and the latter reported it to me on £nd November- (See Annexes 31 and 40). - x x THY IMPERIAL G^VERITirZNT FOR THE REASONS STATED IN THE ARE CONVINCED OF TEE ILLEGALITY OF THE CAbCI j.i G W I* TLa. •iOR- .

(No. 123 dated 4th September 1876). xxxxxxxxxx Leaving Sirree noon of the 24th we anchored at Bu Musa by 6 same evening. The Chief of Shargah has found good fresh water, 3 wells close to Bu Musa peak (300 yards east of peak). Wells are 24 feet deep. Several other wells after digging 14 feet had to be abandoned, although they were distant a mile from sea. They had dug through 6 feet fine mud, then a small conglomerate shingle and shell beach followed by more compact lime-stone. Salt water came up. Strange that there are some of thes-e failures v/ithin 400 yards of sweet water. The island is covered with a luxuriant grass in some places a foot high, it is chiefly level land, a few hillocks near the margin of the sea. Chief has sent over 40 mares, and some foal p/one horse, eleven camels to give milk for the latter. Horses get two pounds of barley and two pounds of dates daily, are turned adrift at 7 a.m. to go where they like, they come home in the evening and are tied up. There are eleven men with them, they have camels 1 milk, two lbs. of dates daily, one day in seven a feed of rice. As for days of the week they know only when the sun gets up and goes down -what need to know more - and are perfectly happy. In the season they catch a turtle or two, and have a glorious feast. The beach on the sea side of the island was strewn with countl© ^ numbers of sea gulls’ eggs, hatched by the sun by day, birds sitting on them at night. \ \I ANNEX (2 ). Translation of a letter from Sheikh Sa?rar bin Khaled bin Sultan, Shargah, to QolonelCox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. (Dated 23rd Rabi I, 1329 = 25th March 1911. After compliments and enquiries after your health, I beg to address you in regard to your inquiry regarding the un dermentioned three points connected with the Abu Musa case* (1) You say that it is claimed that on the 12th Shaaban 1316 after my return from the HaJJ, Sheikh Salim granted to three persons an agreement for the extraction of Mica from Bu Musa Island without any permission from me, and you en quire from me that if I was aware of the same, how was it that I did not mention this agreement to you on the 19th Moharram 1326, when I presented to you a statement of my relations with Sheikh Salim in regard to the Bu Musa Island. (2) You also mention to me the question of joteam and flot sam on the Bu Musa Island and state that it is claimed that Sheikh Salim was receiving the income on this account, and (3) You have also shown me the translation of a paper claimed to be which is/dated the 4th Zilkhadeh 1315 and to be the first draft of the Oxide Contract which was altered to another form on the 18th Zilkhadeh 1315. This is my reply with regard to three pointsi- Pirstly - In regard to the Mica Agreement I was fully aware of it and Sheikh Salim consulted me (about it) and % it would not have been possible that the said agreement could be issued without coming to my knowledge as Ruling Chief. But as I informed you two years ago, I had left to Sheikh Salim all the income which he could obtain from the aforesaid island, and consequently I did not trouble (myself) to object to this (agreement). At the same time whenI presented to you the said statement regarding my relations with Sheikh Salim in respect of Bu Musa, the question of this Mica contract dm did not occur to my mind at all, for, as you must be aware, the Mica affair produced no result whatever. As regards the sum of ^ 1500 payable by instalments to Sheikh Salim, I have no information as to how many instal ments were received by Sheikh Salim. I did not trouble to make enquiries about the instalments, nor did I demand anything from Sheikh Salim on that account. It was my wish that he should get something from it and that he should not trouble me about his expenses* Secondly - As regards the right to joteam and flotsam on Bu Musa Island and all the islands of Kowasim, it Is not open to doubt that it is due to the Chief of the Kowasim, but the usual custom on the Oman Coast is that the inhabitants of the place exact their rights on the scene of the wreck and when the Chief comes to know of it he settles the matter according to his own opinion; sometimes he takes his own share from his subjects and sometimes he does not take from them. In the case of Bu Musa, as I had left all the revenue to Sheikh Salim, I treated my right of jotsam and flotsam as a part of the income to go to him and used to ask no questions about it. Thirdly - With regard to the rejected draft of the Oxide agreement, I have now noted its wording but had neither seen nor heard of it before. The reason for its rejection is ob viously because Sheikh Salim could not write about Bu Musa in these terms, namely, 'so long as I, my children and my brothers live, no one is entitled to raise objection to it • No doubt this was the cause of the draft being changed. This is what was necessary to be stated and aalAn^si. (L.S.)Sagar bin Khaled bin Sultan.ANNEX ( 3 ) Wo. 22 . ^ated 17th May 1894. From - The hesidency Agent, Shargah.

A letter reached me from the Residency Agent residing at Bahrein, enclosing a copy of a letter from the Chief of Bahrein regarding a jolly boat belonging to one of SheiMh Isa’s subjects, named Mohamed bin Saleh bin Jebara, which stranded on the Isle of Abu Musa. Your servant endeavoured % to release the jolly boat from the hands of the inhabitants of Abu Musa for the sum of £.70; at the time Mohamed bin Saleh bin Jebara was present with me, the inhabitants of Abu ^usa refused but (would) only accept half (of the value of the boat and cargo) according to custom, ^ohamed bin °aleh bin Jehara departed from Bahrein to inform his u hief (and point out) that should he desire to entreat the °hief of Shargah on account of friendship or (for) other reason (the latter would release it). When the (Bahrein) Agent’s letter reached me I returned an answer according to what had passed on this subject but no reply has come (to it). According to what is noticed by me (i«J,that the inhabitants of Abu Musa voyage in the jolly boat and convey cargo, it has become necessary to inform you, as, probably that an accident may befall the boat.

I beg to state that the Chief Officer of the B.I.S.N. 00*3 S.S.'Bulimba' came to me on the 1st April 1907, report ing that the steamer had stranded on the Bu Musa island and asking me to notify the Shargah merchants to send lighters to Bu Musa for the purpose of landing the cargoes they had on board her. I notified the merchants accordingly. The officer then proceeded to Debai to meet the Ship^ ^gent, Mohamed bin Ibrahim, and arrange for the despatch of lighters to Bu Musa. I was informed by the Officer that the islanders had not ag reed to render the vessel any assistance unless they received half the cargo. The Agent, Mohamed Ibrahim, having asked me for assistance to be rendered to the steamer, 1 sent with him my brother, Maaraj bin Abdul Rahman to B u Musa lest the islanders may do something irregular towards the ship^ crew and the cargo which it may be desirable to discharge on the island in order to launch the vessel. I took likewise a letter from the Ghief of Shargah to the islanders ordering them to refrain from raising objections against the ship’s crew, and to give them such help as they can. However, by God’s grace and the Com pany’s good fortune, the sea remained calm and waveless while the vessel was stranded until arrangements were made for launching her. According to Maaraj’s report to me H.M.S. 'Highflyer' had visited Bu Musa just as the stranded vessel was being launched. Thank God, nothing unpleasant occurred in the vessel’s stranding, but if a storm had taken place, she would have incurred some damage having stranded on hard rock •ANNFX ( | ) No. 305 of 1911 &lt; 1 ) British Residency and Consulate-General Bushire, 1st March 1905.

(Hated 25th March 1911). With reference to the translation tfhlch you have shc^m to me of what purports to be a rejected preliminary draft, dated 6 th April 1398, of the Oxide Concession executed on fhe : ~ 10 th April 1898, I beg to make the following observations:- I note that the document purports to be signed by (i) Hasan bin Ahmed and (2$ All Ahmed Saleh. The Hasan bin Ahmed mentioned was a retainer of Sheikh Salin Ali ABimed Saleh is the man whose identity you know as Nakhoda Ali. I had nothing to do with the writing or drafting of this document. I remember that I had been absent on duty at Bushire during the spring of the year in question and it was on my return to Shargah that the project for an Oxide Concession was discuss ed. The draft had been drawn up by Abdullah bin Hasan Samaiy- eh and it was he who showed it to me. At the same time he and Nakhoda Ali, who was also there, asked me to let my son Isa come into the concern as they needed some one on the spot at Shargah in order to keep in touch with Sheikhs Sagar and Salim. I agreed, but pointed out that the terms of the proposed Con cession as at present drafted were quite impossible, and that neither Sheikh Sagar would confirm it nor would the Govern- ment approve it. What I especially objected to was (1) the sentence In which Sheikh Salim is made to say 'so long as I, my children and my brothers live, no one will be entitled to raise objection to it' and (2) the inclusion of Nakhoda Ali as a signatory on the document. With regard to (1), I would explain that Salim was an old man of 70 , who might be expected to die at any time, and I was taking into account the fact that if he died, wo should thenceforthr&gt; theneefortn nave to deal with Sheikh Sagar. As regards (2) I thought the inclusion cf Nakhoda All was inexpedient, as I had just been visiting Bushire and knew him to be in very bad odour with the Residency in connection with his Bushire affairs and he was also at log gerheads drawn with the well-known Moln-et-Tujjar of Tehran holder of tlie Hormuz Concession, and I feared the latter would be likely to give us trouble if he came to know that Nakhoda All was a partner in a rival Oxide enterprise. I also omitted the 20 year time limit, as I saw no object in Inserting any fixed period of time. Dated 25th March 1911. (Signed.)

I was anxious to put the work on a more business-like footing and therefore drew up some rules and sent them to Hasan. The latter made certain additions and had five documents drawn up including the additions and signed by himself, Abdullah, and Nakhoda Ali, and he forwarded them all to me for completion by the attachment of the signatures of Sheikh Sagar and myself. When completed, I was to return 3 of them to him, one for himself, one for Abdullah, and one for Nakhoda Ali. Of the remaining two I was to give one to Sheikh Sagar and keep one myself. I did not however care about the extra con dition which he had inserted and wrote back and said so. There the matter ended. These deeds were never completed nor were any revised documents drawn up. I never showed them to Sheikh Sagar and produce them now in the state in which I received them. These Rules never having become operative Esa and I always considered and presumed that the document on which the concern was carried on was that of Zilhijjeh 1315, in which Nakhoda Ali was admitted to partnership and in which it is laid down that the sale loading and shipping should be carried out with the knowledge of all the partners, By reason of Hasan’s neglect to consult us properly and his H i T Ifi failure r\failure to render any accounts, we became dissatisfied with his conduct of affairs.ANNEX ( |3 V Not© by Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif on the reference to a dispute between Sheikha Sagar and Salim regarding Sir Abu Nuair Island (made in hia letter of 27th Jamadi II, 1316 = 14th November 1898).

Your Honour enquires from me to what I referred in my * letter dated 27th Jamadi II 1316 when I wrote the following sentencet- w As regards Sir, a dispute has arisen between Sheikhs Saggar and Salim. It is Sagar f s intention to lease without mentioning Salim’s name and to give some advantage to Salim, but Salim would not agree to this'. ' The explanation of the above passage is as follows:- It will be remembered that in the second agreement bet ween Sheikh Sagar and Sheikh Salim (dated 1884) at which my predecessor was the intermediary, Sheikh Sagar granted to Sheikh Salim an annual pension of 400 dollars together with the revenue of Sir Bu Nuair, which was expected to bring in 4 some 200 . s Up to 1889, however, this island did not produce any revenue as was expected and consequently no mention was made of it in the third agreement dated 5th Shaaban 1306 (1889) and Sheikh Saim ceased to take any interest in it. When, however, it became probable that the island might pro duce some revenue as the result of the Concession alluded to in my letter to Hasan Samaiyeh now under reference, oheikh Salim’s interest was naturally revived and he wanted to claim the revenue under the obsalet© agreement ol 1884, which Sheikh Sagar was altogether unwilling to agree to on tha ground that under the last agreement (1889) which was * Annex 15 of German Rejoinder. ^ 4 Vide my Memorandum of 88 th February 1908 -Tnolosure 6 to First British Note.'O' now in force the revenue of Sir Bu Nualr Island was not an item of the settlement.

He was for some years Consular Agent for France at Lingah, but in 1907 he was proceeded against by the Customs for smuggling a large quantity of tobacco; and in January 1909 Andurrahraan having circulated a silly story to the effect that the French were going to seize the port of Xung near Lingah, H.M’s Minister on receiving the report communicated it to his French Col logue, who must also have received it from the French Consul at Bushire, and replied that he he had already had occasion to complain of Abdurrahman, and a little later gave him his dismissal.

He has been able specifically to give us trouble by attempting to treat Arab visitors from Muscat, Trucial Coast, Bahrein and Koweit as Turkish subjects and thrust upon them Turkish passports or visas, and it has only been by the vigilance of our Agent at Lingah and continual pressure on the local Persian Authorities by the Residency that Mohamed Abdulla has been prevented from achieving much practical us success.

ENCLOSURE TO ANNEX ( |!^ ). Extract from a letter from the Politioal Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, to the Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. (No. 1559, dated the 4th July 1909). X XXxx XXXXX Our Agent at Lingah has for years past experienced a great deal of trouble from the vagaries and intrigues of a Persian named Muhammad Abdulla, who though carrying no commission and though the Tehran Government have refused to agree to his appointment, has nevertheless managed, by flying a Turkish Flag and using a spurious rubber seal, to pose as a Turkish Consular official and, under this guise, to make difficulties for our Agent by encouraging visitors from Oman or Bahrein to accept his protection, and in other to ways. We have repeatedly complained/the Governor of the Gulf Ports of the conduct of this Persian and also to His Majesty’s Legation. While Muhammad Abdulla has always been repudiated he has never been suppressed, until last year when the Darya Begi in pursuance of orders received from Tehran took the opportunity afforded by a personal visit to Lingah to have Muhammad Abdulla’s Flagstaff removed. Soon after this incident, the Wali of Busreh, who properly speaking would appear to have no status to interfere in affairs on the Persian Coast, sent a representative down to Lingah whom Muhammad Abdulla took steps to cram with garbled stories of his ill-treatment by the Darya Begi, and this has now resulted in a complaint against the Darya Begi by the Turkish Legation and a demand that the Governor of the Gulf Ports should give satisfaction. A telegram recently received by His Excellency from the Persian Foreign Minister quotes Hasan Samaiyeh as being one ofthe persons who had furnished statements on which the Turkish demand for satisfaction from the Darya Beg?, was based. The other two persons who are quoted by name are also individuals with pronounced anti-English proclivities, one of whom has lately been removed from the post of French Consular Agent which he formerly held. xxxxxxxxxxANNEX ( q ).

A lease has several conditions and if a single condition (thereof) is violated, the lease becomes invalid, and how it would be now that several conditions have been omitted therefrom. Firstly it becomes binding by a known period. This has been omitted however. Secondly, a lease becomes binding by proposal and acceptance.

(Signed and sealed) Abdul Kerim, servant of the Shera Law at Qeis. (ix). The answer. Praise be to God, Who leads to the right! This lease as it is mentioned in the question is not in accord with the precepts of the august Shera and is null and void and invalid. So, the owner of the property has the option to return to his property and he has the absolute possession thereof and can use his property in any manner that he may wish. He has the option (to do so) and the lessee has no right or title in that property. And whatever is invalid according to the August Shera is to be considered as non-existent.

A . C« 9 It is now a long time that I have received no letters from you. Perhaps the cause which prevented it is good. I am always receiving letters from my father Hasan who gives me the news of your health. You should, God willing, inform me of your health and the news of your side by every mail. 0 my brother, I beg to advise you in connection with the dispute which was between us and Sassoon. We have settled with Sassoon and it has been arranged that a compromise should be effected. And we have written papers of compromise for the settlement of the dispute. And whereas your father was one of the partners and he has now passed away, and whereas you are in his place and are his executor, it is necessary that you should give a Power of Attorney from yourself in my name so that I may affix, in the documents, your signature with the signatures of the partners which are (rec 6 ried) in ^he documents held by me in the case versus Sassoon, as Sassoon knows that Haji Ali has passed away and that I, Abdullah, was his Agent at Calcutta. Now, after Haji All’s death, it is ob vious that you are his executor and it is necessary that you should write a Power of Attorney for me (saying)that I am your Agent in Calcutta in all the affairs which may occur in Calcutta as I was before in the affairs of your father. For this purpose I have now written a Power of Attorney in English in accordance with the law which will be accepted by the Court; it is a Power of Attorney from you in my name. There is also an affidavit testifying that you are Ne 3 ef bln Haji /-NHaji Ali - hia executor and attorney and that you are now in his place. This certificate together with the Power should be taken by yourself to the British Resident or Ageistant Resi dent at Bunder Abbas and you should, in his presence, admit that you are the son of Haji Ali and are in your father’s place and that you have made this power in the name of Abdullah bin Hasan who is to be your Agent in Calcutta as he was before in the lifetime of Haji Ali. Also the Resident or the As sistant Resident should certify in the affidavit that you are Haji Ali’s son and his representative. You should also take a writing from the Belgian Director of Customs that you are Haji Ali’s son and his representative and obtain another certificate from the Postmaster and expedite sending them to me by Registered Post soon and without delay, and write on the cover my address in English as follows A.H.H. Samaiyeh &amp; Co., 34/l College Street, Cal c u t t a. You should not delay the Power and the Documents but send them to me at an early date. I have also advised my father Hasan who will also let you *now and urge upon you. I know that at the moment of their arrival, you will expedite sending them on. I have written you this by post and I now intend going to the Solicitors so that I may write the Power and the affidavit and send them to you by Registered post. I need not urge you further that you should expedite doing what I have advised you. This is what was necessary. The letter was written most hastily. Your humblest friend, Abdullah bin Hasan Samaiyeh. P.S. (in red ink). x Power by this mail as it was not prepared.Td wiUingf I shall send it to you by the next F p ,r/-vn t qhall send it by Registered mail.

(Dated Calcutta 1st Shaaban 1322 = 11th October 1904). After compliments and enquiries after your health. I have this day written you a letter by post and enlightened you therein of what was necessary to be stated. God willing it will find you in good health. I have informed you especially that a settlement has been made between us and David Sassoon by compromise and re conciliation. And let it not be hidden from you that owing to the fact that Haji Ali has passed away, there is need for a Power from you so that I may sign for you in the papers appertaining to the compromise, because, in the beginning there was in our hand a Power from your father Haji Ali (stating) that I was his Agent in Calcutta, and after your father 1 s death I informed(them) that you were in your father’s place; and the Court demanded that you should write a Power for me setting forth that you are the attorney and executor of the will of your father and also that I am Agent in Cal cutta on your behalf in the Sassoon case, and for the Oxide etcetera and the Power should be (written) in English in ac cordance with the law, because Haji Ali has passed away and it is necessary that the Court should understand that Haji Ali has no son besides you. Therefore in order to settle the affairs I have written in your name a special Power in the case of Oxide and our dispute with Sassoon (saying) that what we now arrange with Sassoon for settlement oy compromise is ag reed upon by you. I intended sending the Power by Registered Post by this mail but it was not ready. This is for your in formation, and God willing, it will reach you by registered pws next mail. YouYou should act upon the instructions which I will now explain to you:- When you receive the Power, you should take it to the Resident or British Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident at Bunder Abbas* He will read it over to you and you should admit before him that this Power is from you to me and that I am your Agent in Calcutta in the same way as in the days of your father and affix your signature - Najaf bin Ali Ahmed Saleh = in the place which is marked in pen cil Then the Resident or Vice-Consul will record his testi mony and seal it with the Government Seal* You should for ward it soon and avoid procrastination and delay and you should send it to me by Registered Post to Calcutta soon and without delay. On the same day when it reaches you, you should take it to the Resident or the Assistant who is now present at Bunder Abbas. I have written you this letter by this mail so that you may know that you will re ceive the Power by registered post. I am sending you this letter in my father’s letter and have forwarded another letter to you by post. Surely I will write you by the next mail also with the Power. Your letters to me should continue without interruption as before when Haji Ali continuously kept me informed of the situation and of the reports. This is what was necessary to be said at present# God willing, I will settle matters after the receipt of the Power and proceed to your side in Shavval. This is what had to be stated and may you remain pre served and generous. Your friend, ( Sd/- Abdullah bin Hasan Samaiyeh).ANNEX ( 3 | )• Affidavit of Nejef bln Nakhoda All. (Dated 19th March 1910). Nejef bln Hajl Nakhoda All states on solemn affirmatlon:- I solemnly declare the following to be the facts regard ing my interviews with Mr. Thomas Brown of Messrs. Wonckhaus a Coy., and if necessary I am prepared to confirm this statement by oath of the Koran before a Mujtahid. I have had several conversations about the Abu Musa case with parties interested. The first was when Abdullah bin Hasan Samaiyeh came to see me accompanied by Mirza (/The Dragoman of the German Consulate.! Hussein Germani. They came to Bunder Abbas and stayed in the house oi Haji Ami ut-TujJar. Abdullah on landing from the ship came to my house and asked me to come over and have a talk about the matter at Haji Amin's house. I went over to Hali Amin's houseand there Mirza Hussein, Abdullah and Haji All 'Ger- ’7factotm'of'the’firm in Lingah. Imani' were present. Abdullah asked me to give him a paper stating that I handed over my share of the concession on Abu Musa to Abdullah bin Hasan. The paper was to be given a date prior to the date of the contract between Messrs. Wonckhaus and Hasan. He also asked me to give him another paper saying that I was quite satisfied with the contract. I refused saying that I would not do anything of the sort unless they settled up my ac count with David Sassoon, that is ray father's on account of oxide, carpets etc. I said if they did not give me back the carpets they should pay me 20,000 (twenty thousand) rupees and settle my account and then I would give them the paper. However, they did not give me the money and I mentioned the matter to the British Consulate. These two /-Ntwo persons came to Bunder Abbas not long after the British Consul Lieutenant Gabriel returned there from a trip he madfe Abbas. The exact date can be ascertained from the Consul Bunder Abbas as I reported the matter to him at the time, but it was t 1ust about two years ago. Mr. Brown had two in terviews with me once at the house of Jamshidia^s Agent and once at the Customs House. At the first interview Agha Ghulam All Khorassani was present, at the second Mr. Moses Khan the Customs Director. Agha Ghulam Ali is Agent of Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Coy. Mr. Brown had a long talk with me. Before beginning to talk about Abu Musa he dismissed two S Hindu^l Gulshan and Asanand Ghulab. Mr. Brown asked me why I had not signed the paper shown me by Abdullah and Mirza Hussein. I said there appeared to be no advantage for me in doing so, and therefore I hadn’t. Mr. Brown said he had bought the share in the oxide Company belonging to Sheikh Sagar for Reals 250. I replied that Sheikh Sagar had never made anything out of the business and so would sell cheap. Mr. Brown said he wanted to buy my share and said that he would settle up all my accounts with Hasan bin Ali and Abdullah. I never offered to sell my share to Mr. Brown. In fact as I reported to the Consulate at the time Mr. Brown offered to buy my share. I would swear to this on the Koran. This took place in the presence of Agha Ghulam Ali Khorassani. At the second interview and after Mr. Moses Khan tried to persuade me to go to Lingah to settle with Mr. Brown. He continued to endea vour to make me do this for a long time and on my refusing he got annoyed with me and worried me to such an extent that I finally had to resign my post as Hamal Bashi at ITalaf admitted and affirmed, on oath,what /\ a.p.

Note by Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif on the meaning of the doubtful passage in his letter to Hasan Samiyeh (Datod 9th Zilhejjeh 13S4 = 2?rd Jonuary 1907). I beg to refer to the sentence in my letter dated 8th Zilhijjeh 1324 ( 23rd January 1907) which runs as follows:- and about the meaning of which there have been arguments. I beg to say that my meaning when I wrote the sentence (The annulment of this agreement is better than the ac ceptance of this agreement). It is not hidden from Your Honour that I received my education in the Gulf and that I am not an expert ^n the niceties of Grammar and the shades of meaning of various measures of words. When I write, I write according to the usages and understanding of the community in which I live. As regards the use of the measure as synonymous with JMtlie use Is quite an ordinary one in these parts and I can mention many other instances of the same such as -7^-' (Reposing) (Continuance) (Being ruined) (Advancing) (Remaining) . Again you There is no idea of a 'desire to' here, will note that in the letter from my son Isa dated 7th Moharram 1325 (20th February 1907) to SheiVh occurs the sentence; . » va atlub min jenabekum almosaadeh fl naqz va istebtal-i- 'hazehel varaqah' (and I beg Your Honour for assistance in the breaking up and annuling of this document) This shows that the words^/s^and were used aynony iuO’ibj-y • FurthermoreFurthermore, when writing to me on the 23rd Moharram with reference to my letter to him (dated 8th Zilhejjeh 1324) enjoining on him the , Hasan used the sane form of words as I had, thus: 'You particularly wrote about the deed of contract 'which I executed with Wonckhaus the German for the sale 'of Oxide from /*bu J'usa Island. I understood what you 'said, namely that your son Esa was not agreeable to the 'execution of a document of this purport for the reason 'that I had not consulted you and that it was necessary 'that the partners should not enter (into transaction) 'without the knowledge of the other partners; that this 'humble^ one had entered into this transaction without 'consultation and that Isa feared that complications 'would result owing to the admittance of foreigners (in- (The annulment of this contract is better than its acceptance). Again in writing to me on 15th Safar 1325 (30th March 1907) Hasan suggested that I had better, if I thought fit, write to the German mysfelf and explain to him regarding the an nulment of the contract. His precise words were : It is clear therefore that Hasan understood me fully in the sense I intended to convey. Secondly, the explanation of the use of the spelling It is rendering into writing of a colloquial con struction of speech. Thus in conversation, if referring to otituting the , Zamah , for ’Kasrah 1 after the ’t*. Similarly if I were referring to a feminine object I should not say for the feminine pronoun ’ha*. Likewise, in writing a collo quial letter I should render the above sounds into writing.

Letter from the Revd. S*M. Zwemer of the Arabian Mission of the Dutch Reformed Church in the Persian Gulf, to Lieut- Colonel Cox, Resident in the Persian Gulf. (Dated Bahrein , March S2nd 1911). With reference to the meaning of the Arabic sentence and the probable intention of the writer in using those words concerning which point you asked my opinion, I take pleasure in replying as follows First, it is evident that whoever wrote the sentence was not a thorough scholar in Arabic, as he confused the mascu line and feminine forms in the last word of the sentence. To my mind the obvious translation of the phrase is, 'the annulment of this agreement is better than its acceptance'. I do not think it is at all obvious or possible to translate the sentence 'the annulment of this agreement is better than to comply with (his wishes)'© This translation is, to my mind, a forced one, and not the natural significance of the words in question, whatever be their connection. I am confirmed in this opinion after consulting with one or two Arabs concerning the popular use of the pronoun in such a sentence, and I find that they agree with me that there is a great looseness in the use of the feminine or masculine pronoun at the close of a clause or s^nten^e. am sure that nine out of ten Arabs would give the preference to the former translation of the sentence as the obvious and natural intention of the writer. Although ny opinion does not carry weight beyond that of others who have a speaking and reading knowledge of Arabic, yet I feel confident that in this case it is not a matter of expert grammatical opinion, but of everyday usage in thethe Persian Gulf, and I have no hesitation in saying that the first translation IS the right one. &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;ANNEX (3(o )• Translation of a letter from Nakhoda All Ahmed Saleh to Messrs.

Should you be asking after me, I arrived at Lingah safely by the last mail and had no time to furnish you with news by that mail. Now I shall comply with such orders as you may have. As regards Abdullah’s circumstances at Calcutta, of course they have themselves informed you of them. My going to Calcutta was quite thrown away. The pro fit resulting from the expense and the hardships to which the sea voyage put me^ all went to prost itute^. Should the affairs continue in this state, nothing will be ob tained from this business and the progress of the enter prise and the popularity of this mineral will not be a- chieved by such behaviour. I state this confidentially for your information. May God himself ordain that relief should be obtain ed in another place.ANNEX Translation of a letter from Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh to Mr. Tigran Malcolm (Dated 11th Jamadi I, 1320 = 16th August 1902). I hope you are keeping well. Your letter which was for warded by the regular mail has been received and noted. I wrote a reply thereto and cent it in the S.S. 'King Arthur' through Zair Hasan for delivery to you, and I hope that you have received it. As regards what you have written about Khadheiri and the firm of Hotz, no reply has been received up to now. It is a long time that no letter has been received from Khadheiri, and when I saw that no letter came from him I also did not write to him. The same happened in the case of Hotz’s firm. God is generous. At last the matter will not remain as it is. God will find a way. I am now in communication with a Hindu (who wishes) to purchase (the oxide) at Bombay at 6 rupees per Gindi; and we offer it at rupees 7 to be deliver ed at the Bombay harbour, the Customs duty and warehouse fee to be paid by the Hindu himself. He wants 2000 Gindis and washes to make a contract, afterwards, for India. If he contracted 4000 tons per annum for India at Rs. 7 per Gindi to be delivered in the Bombay harbour, Baji Hasan will agree. Let me see what happens. I will let you know. This price for which he buys means that the bag and freight to Bombay should be payable by us. If the bags are new they will cost Rs. 12 per 100 and if they are old they cost Rs. 6 per 100. Old and new should be mixed, so that the oxide may duly reach Bombay. It should be weighed in the steamer. May God wish that these terms should be agreed upon. If Abdullah does not spoil(the matter) it will be good. He (Haji Hasan) has intimated to Abdullah but has written that he (Abdullah) should not speak about it but should intimate ifif it is not detrimental to his Calcutta oxide market. Let us see what reply is received from Abdullah. We have also given a draft for Re. 1000/- so that new bags may be pur chased. I stated (the above) for your information so that you may be aware that the affairs have not progressed upto now. It was all due to themselves. Wherever the matter is arranged Abdullah will at last spoil it. As to the matter of Khadheiri and the firm of Hotz, I know he (Abdullah) has written something, owing to which they will not write any letters hereafter. Greetings!ANNEX (35 1 ). Translation of a letter from Nakhoda All Ahmed Saleh to Mr. Tigran Malcolm. ( Dated 9th Jamadi II, 1320 = 13th September 1902). A.C., Your letter has been received and I have understood its contents. As regards Mr. Zeytoon, you have written that he will be coming to Lingah by the mail steamer but he did not come. I have heard that the Agent of Khadheiri's Steamers is Agha Ali Haji Muhammad Amin, but so far he has not spoken to any one regarding freight. I am making enquiries. With regard to the 2000 Gindis Oxide which the Hindu wanted to take at 6-g- rupees per Gindi, Agha Abdullah has written to Haji Hasan that he should not give(this quantity); as, if he gave, the Calcutta market will be injured. And so far, he (Abdullah) has also sold nothing. Six months have now passed and he has done nothing. I told Faji Hasan that we should sell 2000 Gindis and pay the value thereof to Ab dullah, so that we may redeem the oxide pawned with the(other) Hindu; but he did not agree. Another Hindu wants 1000 Gindis at the same price. Haji Hasan has not agreed (to supply him) and they are now in negotiations to buy from Hormuz and they will do so. They will, in the end, ship from Hormuz and take the stuff where they like, and this chance will be lost by i us. (As regards) Hotz's Agent, we left together for the Island of Bin Musa. When we took our departure we had no men to work on the boat and there were not sufficient men. We were on the sea for four days and four nights and did not even then reach the island. We returned to Lingah. If he had sup= plied efficient men or if I myself had engaged efficient men, wewe should have reached the Island. This is the way Haji Hasan goes on. I do not know whether he wishes that I should get tired and that the Island should be for himself. Other facts will turn out. Greeting.ANNEX ( J L \ ). Translation of a letter from Nakhoda All Ahmed Saleh to Mr. Tigran Malcolm© of Bushire. ( Undated but written some time in 1902). A • C • 9 As regards the Sir Island, if you can make arrange ments with some one in Calcutta besides the firm of Sassoon, it will, in my opinion, be better* No one will then raise any claim in Calcutta and the claimant's statement will not be listened to* There are many words which cannot be written. The circumstances in connection with the Calcutta Oxide are all due to the London firm, because one year ago they ru moured at Lingah that we are no longer able to work the oxide in the Bin Musa Island; and H it was written from London that they should spend as much as they can and take the Is land out of our hands. In my opinion, an opportunity has now been offered to them, because I was myself at Calcutta and a Hindu offered to buy all the oxide and the value was also arranged. He also paid Rs. 1000 and was to pay Rs.4000 more and take delivery of the goods. They cancelled it (however) for the sake of one month's respite. So far four months have elapsed and the oxide has remained unsold. Had I not been afraid of the Bank, I would have gone myself to Calcutta and disposed of the oxide in any way. When I was at Calcutta there were many buyers. The oxide will now zemain (unsold) like a horse in Bombay which will eat so much that it will be lost at length. you will of course say that I knew this from the begin ning. The oxide which was shipped has been consigned to Mr. Brady. If you had brought to their office it had to be signed to them. According(vjj According to what Abdullah has written to Haji Hasan and myself, the Calcutta Office says 'tell Malcolm not to write any letters to the Bombay Office'. It becomes evident that as you know well the courses of affairs and the answers due to every one, and as you grasp facts, it is for this reason that he says you should write no letters for us (i.e. on our behalf). Otherwise what is the object? Every letter requires an answer. I do not know what to write concerning the state of things which has been brought about. It is now about three four years that despite all my endeavours to get oxide shipped to London as a sample, it cannot be done. What further should I represent to you and Salams.ANNEX ( 1} I ) Extract from a letter from Hasan bin Ali Samaiyeh,Lingah, to Abdul Latif bin Abdul Rahman. a- * - (Dated 5th Ramzan 1317 = 7th January 1900).

(You afld that) Yusuf agreed to sell, and that the deal had reached the figure of 400 and that Yusuf had stood to this as his final answer and Naser asked for a slight reduction i.e. to $ 350. And when you learned this, you told Yusuf not to sell. You have KBnx aj. very well. We are the better entitled to take the xxhEX share to from Yusuf and it will then go over/the partners. My brother, it is not our intention that foreigners should be included with us.

With reference to your letter of the 6 th instant relative to the claim of Messrs. Wonckhaus in connection with the shipment of red oxide from Abu Musa, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith draft of a note, which, subject to any modifications which Viscount Morley may suggest after consultation with the Government of India, he would propose to address to the German Ambassador, offering to compro mise the matter on the lines laid down at the Inter-departmental Conference which met on 18th March. # The note referred to in the first paragraph of this draft is that in which will be forwarded to Count Metternich the reply of His Majesty’s Government to His Excellency’s communication of 4th December 1909. This reply cannot, of course, be drawn up till the results of the further enquiry recently made by His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire have been received from the Government of India. As regards the first condition of the compromise proposed in the note, Lord Morley will observe that, in conformity with the recommendation of the conference, allusion is made to Sir E. Greys note of d-nd August last, in which it was pointed out to Count Metternich that, by tlm admission of the German A ice-Consul at Bushire, the quantity of oxide shipped m Apnl 1908, on board the Steamship “Louise” was sufficient to enable Messrs. Wonckhaus to discharge all the obligations which they had contracted previous to the cancellation of the concession by the Sheikh of Shaiga, and m which it was further stated that some of the mineral belonging to that shipment was then still lying unsold at Hamburg. This reference is included in order to forestall any possible claim for compensation put forward by the firm in connection with alleged inability to fulfil forward contiacts b} icason of the interruption of their shipments. . As regards the second condition, it would seem that, il, as the n m pio- posed, the unexpired portion of the interrupted contract is allowed to run out from a given date, a claim on account of losses incurred by the inter ruption, in-so-far as the capital sum is concerned, may be avoided and payment be confined to the interest on that sum which could be fixed at a reasonable rate. It is recognised, however, that Messrs. AVonckhaus, by their contract with Hassan Samaiya, have the option of renewing it on its expiration and that they may therefore be unwilling to accept the view indicated in the preceding paragraph on the ground that it is only tenable in the e ase o a non lenew able contract definitely terminable on a given date. . , .. . It has therefore been thought desirable to insert in this second condition a clause which, by annulling Messrs. AVonckhaus’ right to renew the contrast, makes it possible at once to rebut a claim for the payment of a capital sum on account of the period of interruption and to ensure the elimination rom any future agreement of the objectionable characteristic o a monopo 3 . ^The third condition has been inserted in view of the paramount impor tance of maintaining the view consistently held am expressec } ^ Majesty’s Government since the beginning of this controversy, that the Sheikh of Sharga acted within his rights as the absolute sovereign of h s dominions in cancelling the concession, thus insisting hl ° . ^ ld freedom from liability in the matter and indicating Hassan Samaiya as th only person against whom Messrs.

Wonckhaus should^ and the amount of the compensation which His . aje y ~ , willing to pay fixed by a judicial tribunal as proposed in your letter °f the 9th ultimo, or merely by the Departments inteieste , « i difficulty, was not definitely decided by the Conference. t , . The' former course, though no doubt it would as f examination, offers objections from the point o view 0 e *P j • ’ while, on the other hand, claims fixed by the latter method have perhaps, some cases, been left at an unduly high figure.o I am accordingly to suggest that the solution of this question should he deferred till the sum claimed by Messrs. Wonckhaus is known, and that, if manifestly moderate, it should be paid after verification by the Departments, and, if excessive, examined and reduced by a Judge deputed by the High Court of Bombay. The point, however, is not, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, one which need be alluded to in correspondence with the German Government, at any rate at the present stage of the discussion. As for the persons to whom the new concession mentioned above in the second condition should be granted by the Sheikh, Sir E. Grey adheres to the views expressed in the letter from this Office of 8 th November last, and considers that the matter is one with which, as a transaction between the Sheikh and certain British subjects, the German Government have no concern. He would also abstain from alluding in the note to the proposal to include in the new concession a clause guaranteeing to the Sheikh the payment of a royalty on the oxide mined since, though the profits of the concessionaires would thereby be reduced, the terms of their contract with Messrs. Wonckhaus and the profits of the latter would remain unaffected. As regards the source from which the claim should be met, a point left undecided by the Conference, a further communication will be addressed to you in due course. The Under Secretary of State for India. I am, &amp;c., (Sd.) Louis Mallet.Draft Note to the German Ambassador. Foreign OHice, Your Excellency, March 1911. I have the honour to refer you to my note of forwarding a memorandum advancing arguments in reply to your communi cation of 4th December 1909 on the subject of the claim of Messrs. Wonckhaus in connection with the shipment of red oxide from Abu Musa. I am confident that the German Government will not fail to appreciate the cogency of the considerations urged in this memorandum in sup port of the attitude assumed by His Majesty’s Government throughout the discussion of this question. That attitude is, in their opinion, com pletely justified by the facts elicited in the course of the further investigations which have been carried out since the receipt of \our Excellency s communication above referred to. I hey have, however, no desire to protract a discussion which has already lasted more than three years and thus still further to prolong the interruption which an important commercial enterprise has already suffered. His Majesty’s Government have been animated from the first by a desire to approacli this subject in the friendliest manner, and it is in conformity with the spirit which they have wished to display throughout that they desire to suggest to the German Government that a compromise should be reached on the following lines 1. His Majesty’s Government, recognising the desire of Messrs.’ Wonckhaus for some compen sation on account of the interruption of their business as the result of the inability of Hassan Sumaiya to carry out his contract with thenq are willing to facilitate the attainment of that object. They would accordingly suggest that the firm should be asked to submit through the German Government a statement of their claim under this head. As to the amount of the losses so incurred, His Majesty’s Government have so far received no precise information, though some light is thrown on the subject by the facts mentioned m para graph 5 of my note of 22nd August 1910. 9 Recognising further the desire of the firm to be restored^as far as possible to the commercial position which they occupied at the moment when their operations were interrupted, His Majesty s Government will use their influence with the Sheikh of Sharga to procure from him the grant of a new concession to suitable persons to continue the working of the mines, and will endeavour to arrange that the contract of 1st June 1900 shouk be allowed to run for a further penod equal to that during which it was interrupted, ihat period was from 10th October 1907 to 1st June 1910. The contract might, for example, run from 1st Maynext to 31st December 1913. / I n s pi te a . n y clause contained in the present contract, the parties shall not be bound after its expiration, to conclude any new agreement. 3. Maintaining in the fullest manner the point of view which they have already expressed that the Sheikh of Sharga, as an absolute sovereign, acted within his rights in cancelling the concession, His Majesty’s Government must insist on the principle that neither they themselves nor the Sheikh can be considered to have incurred any liability for the losses suffered by Messrs. W onckhaus, whose claim lies solely against Hassan Samaiya. His Majesty’s Government undertake, however, to use their best endeavours to ensure that the firm should receive such sum in compensation as may finally be fixed. His Majesty’s Government have every confi dence that the good intentions which have prompted this offer will be appreciated by the German Go vernment, and that they will see their way to co-operate in the satisfactory^ settlement of this protracted controversy by recommending to the firm concerned the acceptance of the proposed compromise.

Nicolson on the 27th instant, as to when the German Government might expect a reply to their last communication on the subject of the claim of Messrs. Robert Wonckhaus and Co., in connection with the shipment of red oxide from Abu Musa. In order to prepare the reply of His Majesty’s Government, it has been necessary for His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire to undertake a further long and minute enquiry, and to collect additional evidence on the spot, and this task would have been completed at a much earlier date had more normal conditions prevailed in the Persian Gulf during the past year. A telegram was, however, received on the 29th instant from the Government of India stating that the collection of the necessary material is now complete, and Sir E.

Machay, dated 18th March, 1911. The period of R. Wonokhaus 's contract rims from 1st June 1906 to ?lst May 1910, and it relates to the delivery of from 2,000 to 5,000 tons per annum. On the 10th October 1907 shipment stopped. Thus 'between October 1907 and May 1910 — sai/, 2 years and 8 months — Wonokhaus ‘s business was interfered with. If he had obtained the maximum quantity under his contract during that time he muld have been able to ship 13,222 ton&gt;s,vjhereas he only, in fact, shipped / * \ sorne 2,200 tons (1,8§0 tons in 1908 and 400 - 500 tons last year). Yhat he might have shipped,, but did not ship, is there]ore 11,132 tons, say, 11,000. According to Strick's letter to Cox of 8th February 1910 the value of Abu lUsa Oxide f.o.b. vas 30/ per ton, while Wonokhaus was to paij only 15/6 per ton for it. Wonckhaus 's profit therefore would have been 14/6 per ton, or £7,975 for 11,000 tons. At the very worst this sum is the maximum, of Wonckhaus 's loss by the cancellation of his contract. It might be arranged to allow the term, of the unexpired period of 4 years to continue from, say 1 May 1911, in which case it would run out on 31 December 1913. This would give Worckhaus his 4 ars contract.

The Earl of Crewe is disposed to concur in the view of the Government of India, that it would be preferable not to propose a compromise until the German note can be answered in detail. But he would suggest that the precise terms to be offered should be discussed forthwith, and, when that has been done, the Government of India mig t be asked when their suggestions for the answer to the German Government are likely to be received. It could'then be finally determined whether to await those suggestions, or to approach the German Government without further delay. , . 3. As regards the terms of the compromise, Lord Crewe would suggest that they be drafted in the Foreign Office in^ consultation with this department, and I am to otter the following preliminary observations upon them. n _ , u , 4. The proposal to arrange in the new concession for the payment of a royalty to the sheikh appears worthy of adoption in justice to him. It may also be advisable to specify the particular British tribunal to which should be entrusted the assessment of the damages to be awarded to Messrs. M onckhaus and, sujjec .o n rG Y opinion, Lord Crewe approves tbe suggestion made m Colonel Cox s mmute of the 12th February 1910, that the High Court of Bomhay should be approached with a view to the deputation of a judge for this purpose. r xh t? • r^'niprl 5. The question of a monopoly is more difficult. In the Foreign Office pnn minute of the 15th February, 1910, it is pointed out that its bTlune 1906 an alteration of the contract between Hassan and \\ onckhaus, dated the ls * &gt; and Lord Crewe appreciates the objections to which this course ^ °P« n ; n ^ he thinks, outweighed by the disadvantage of forma &gt; ra i ymg is objectionable In itself, and might hereafter be treated as a P^edentm other negotiations between private parties and the trucia or o er ' , , ’ .

In any case the consideration ^ wlth which opinion, determine the question of the appoi lomii cbiect as stated in the Foreign the action of the Indian Government was taken ^ coh ical character, viz., to Office printed minute of the 4th February, which was believed prevent Germany from getting a foothold in Abu Musa, an island . To Government of India di«o «Lc), H, 1911; Lieutenant-Colonel Cox to Government of India, Lecemoi.2 to bo suitable for a coaling station. It is evident, tlieiefore, that important Imperial as well as Indian interests were at stake, and Lord Crewe would strongly urge that whatever expenditure may ultimately be incurred should be equally divided between the British and Indian Governments. In this connection, I am to refer to the letter of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, dated the 5th August, 1909, i enclosed in your letter dated the 13th August, 1909, wherein the opinion was expressed \1 that the question of the charge of expenditure incurred in regard to places in the Persian Gulf, though not on the Persian littoral, “ should be considered on the merits of each individual case.” 7. It seems relevant also to observe that the German Government have throughout ( dealt with the case as one affecting foreign relations between themselves and the Government of His Majesty. 8 . As regards the length of time that has been spent in replying to that Govern ment’s notes, I am to observe that, from the diversity of the issues raised, an enormous amount of labour has been imposed on all concerned, and especially on the political resident in the Gulf. The German reply to the British memorandum of the 10th July, 1908, was itself dated the 4th December, 1909, nearly a year anda-half after the receipt of the British note. I am, &amp;c. R.

I a v n directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, relative to the proposal to approach the German Government with a view to effect a compromise in the .matter of the concession to work the mines of red oxide on the island of Abu Musa. Earl of Crewe in concurring in the view of the Govern ment of India that it would be preferable not to pro pose a compromise till the last note of the German Government can be answered in detail, since to adopt the contrary course might make it appear that His Majesty's Government were disposed to offer terms only because they were unable to find an answer to the German arguments ana might in consequence indispose the German Government to adopt a conciliatory attitude. I am to state that Sir E. Grey agrees with the If lO(4908/11). If on the other hand the coinproiniBe 1b offerea when the reply of His Majesty's Government is presented, the frienuly intention hy which the offer is dictated will he clear, since it will he seen that it is made in spite of the fact that good arguments have been found to rehut the German contentions. Sir E. Grey further agrees that it would he well that the precise terms of the proposed compromise should he settled forthwith hy consultation between this office ana your Department f and he would suggest that a small interdepartmental conference between one or two members of each Department should take place here at some time in the near future convenient to the representatiVoS of your Office, at which these details could he arranged. The suggestions of the Government of India on the results of these deliberations could then he invited and, as proposed in your letter, a settlement arrived at of the question whether or not the German Government should he approached before those suggestions are received. Sir(4S08/11). Sir E.

Wcnckhaus. The question whether the clause in the contract between the concessionnaires and Messrs Wonckhaus, whereby a monopoly of the output of the oxide deposits on Abu Musa is assured to the latter, ought to be eliminated ana that of the source from which the sum required to compensate the German firm should be derived might also be settled at the proposed inter departmental conference.

Dr. Listemann ashed me somewhat apologetically in private conversation not to think ttet he wished to be uncompromising or to make unnecessary difficulties, and explained that he was acting under instructions in regard to the attitude he was maintaining with reference to Messrs Wonckhaus* right to intervene as partners in the Mining Company. I have etc,, Sd/- P.2. Cox, Id eu t- Co lo ne 1, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.Sir, With reference to your letter correspondence subsequently commun- by the S.of S.for India to address approach the German Govt, with a at Abu Musa. The Karl of Crewe is disposed of India that it would be preferable not to propose a compromise until the German note can be answered that the precise terms to be offered when that has been done^the Govt, of India might be ashed when their suggestions for the answer to the German Govt.are likely to be receiv ed. It could then be finally deter mined whether to await those sug Govt.without further delay. As regards the terms of the compromise,Lord Crewe would suggest that they be drafted in the F.O. in consultation with this Dept.,and I am to offer the follow- ijig preliminary observations upon them . The proposal to arrange m Draft , No .294,dated the 8th JJovr.last,and '•k icated to your Dept'.,I am directed fG (^1 f f you regarding the proposal to view to effecting a compromise in the matter of the oxide concession (G to concur in the view of the Govt. in detail. But he would suggest gestions, or to approach the German thethe new concession for the payment of a royalty to the Sheikh, appears worthy of adoption in justice to him. It may also be advisable to specify the particular British tribunal to which should be entrust ed the assessment of the damages to be awarded to Messrs .Wonckhcms; and subject to Sir E.Grey's opinion Lord Crewe approves the suggestion made in Colonel Cox's minute of 12th.Feby.1910 that the High Court of Bombay should Repute v,~ m judrinttrL &amp;ffzc&amp;rjfor this purpose. The question of a monopoly is more difficult. In the F.O.printed Minute of 15th.Feby.1910 it is pointed out that its withdrawal would involve an alteration of the contract between Hassan and Wonck- haus,dated the 1st.June ISOdland Lord Crewe appreciates the objec tions to which this course is open. But they are,he thinks, outweighed by the disadvantage of formally ratifying an arrangement which is objectienable in itself and might hereafter be treated as a precedent m other negotiations between private parties and the Trucial or other Chiefs. As therefore the term of the original contract ex pired on 1st. June last, he would p^&amp;f&amp;r that, if practicable, a new contract sho\uld be executed without ^ «* 0 -&gt; % fa . ” /o Ai ’/Sw^V Hui'without the monopoly provision f and with such readjustment of prices as the increased payment by way of royalty to the Sheikh might necess- itate. With regard to the final para. of your letter of the Sth.Novr. t Lord Crewe trusts that Sir K .Grey will reconsider the view that the payment of any damages to Messrs. Wonckhaus should devolve solely upon the Government of India. It is true that the action of the Resident in prompting the Sheikh to cancel the oxide concession was taken without previous application for Sir E.Grey's concurrence . But / though your Department was kept fully informed of the course of events(see enclosures m this Office x * &lt; ’ tt/W* * letters of 25 March,15 June and 26 July ISnot only was no exception taken to the Resident ’s action, but Sir K.Grey approved the proposals made by the G-ovt .of India as a direct result of that action (F.O.letter of 6th .Aug .1907) and the telegram oj 30th % Aug .yto the Govt, of India authorising the removal of Hassan 's worsen from the island was sent with his concurrence. In any case the consideration which should, in Lord Crewe's opinion, determine the question of the apportionmentof damages is the object with which the action of the Indian Govt, was taken. That object, as stated in the F.0.printed minute of the 4th.Feby.1910, was of a political character, viz. to prevent Germany from getting a foothold in Abu Musa, an island which was believed to be suitable for a coaling station. It is evident, therefore, that important Imperial as well as Indian interests were at stake , and Lord Crewe would strongly urge that whatever expenditure may ultimately be incurred should be equally defrayed between the British and Indian Govts. In this connec tion I am to refer to the letter of the Lords Cormrs. of H.M 9 s .Treasury &amp;. nir Jfc. : /cj cT-cj I dated the 5th .Aug .190^jwJierein the opinion was expressed that the question of the charge of expendi ture incurred in regard to places in the Persian Gulf, though not on the Persian littoral, 'should be considered on the merits of each individual case'. It seems relevant also to observe that the German Govt .have throughout dealt with the casej^^ tho- widest ’pro 1 i tireu 1 -'i-f ?\^ As regards the length of time that has been spent in replying to that Govt, 's notes, I am to observe that from the diversity of the issues \ V 77, &lt;7A ( n - ^ Ola ^wc cXx-v tiaj~ynr^ X;N &lt;# v issues raised an enormous amount of labour has been imposed on all concerned, and especially on the Political Resident in the Gulf. The German reply to the British Memo, of the 10th.July 1908 was itself dated the 4th .Deer.1909, nearly a year and a half after the receipt of the British Note. Jb 'Q, R. A-^d C.oir-If the incidents dealt with in these papers had occurred in Persia we could, with reasonable hopes of success, ask the Foreign Office to share the expenditure involved; though it is possible that they would resist the claim on the ground that their consent was not asked in the first instance to the step which has brought about the present situation. They might also object to give any undertaking in the matter until the amount of the expenditure is known. At present it appears to be very indeterminate. But there is no agreement under which the Foreign Office are bound to share our diplomatic expenditure in Arabia, except at Jeddah and Hodeida - for example we bear the whole cost of the consular establishments at Muscat and Bahrein, although it might reasonably be contended that the Imperial Government has a very distinct interest in their maintenance - and An the recent case of quarantine expenditure at Bahrein the Treasury said that they wished to guard themselves 'against any general extension of the practice (in regard to division of diplomatic expenditure in Persia) to places like Bahrein, which, al though situated in the Persian Gulf,are not on the Persian Littoral', and that they were of opinion that 'the question of the chargeof expenditure incurred inregard to pi aces so si tuated should be\ considered on the merits of each individual case' (Treasury^ to Foreign Office 5th August 1909, Political 3840/09). j The most that we can do in the present case is to plead that the action of the Oovernment of India was taken with the distinct object of safeguarding Imperial as well | as Indian interests in the Gulf,that the Imperial interests, at stake in the matter were of great importance, and in the opinion of the Secretary of State it is reasonable that the Imperial Government should share the expenditure involved. It will be noticed that in their letter of the 8th November last the Foreign Office express the 'confident hope' that Lord Crewe will accept the view that the damages should devolve upon India alone. The case being a complicated one and its details, including the causes of the delay referred to by the Foreigri Office in the letter just mentioned, being much better knom to the Political Department than to this Department, it woula probably be better that any addition to the draft dealing the adjustment of expenditure should be drawn up in j thefirst instance in tie Depart.ent and then referrei t0 this Department, than that it should he drafted in this Department and then criticised in the Political Department. tftyl/t'lFrom Viceroy, lith January 1911 Foreign Seciet. Abu Musa. \ our telegram of 15th November. Please see Cox’s telegram 1223 of 23rd December, forwarded with Foreign Secretary’s weekly letter 51 M. of 29th December. We concur with Cox’s view that it would be preferable not to present terms of compromise until Cox is able to prepare answer to German Note of 4th December. If, however, His Majesty’s Government consider it desirable to offer terms without waiting for our counter case we support Cox’s detailed proposals as to allocation of damages which may be awarded to Wonckhaus. We submit that this question should be determined, not by consideration of responsibility for original intei niption of contract or for delay in preparing the counter case, but with refeience solely to the interests involved in the action our agent (? has) taken with a view to maintaining British political predominance in the Gulf, in which policy His Majesty’s Government are at least as greatly interested as Government of India. An equitable arrangement would be for the charge to be borne in equal shares, and we are prepared to accept adjustment on this basis.Telegram - p.

In continuation of my letter No. 1720, dated the 26th June 1910, I have the honour to submit for the information of Government copies of further correspondence which has passed with the German Con sul and others in connection with the Abu Musa Case. 2 . The correspondence mainly relates to the claim preferred by the German Consulate at the instance of Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. for gear said to have been lost from the huts on the Island. (1) German Consul to Resident, No. 353, dated the 6th August 1910, (2) Lieutenant-Colonel Cox 'to Dr. Listemann. Informal note, dated the 7th August 1910. (3) German Consul to Resident, No. 414, dated the 23rd September 1910. ^ (4) Resident to German Consul, No. 2601, dated the 29th September 1910. (6) Resident to Shaikh of Shargah, No. 300, dated the 30th Sep tember 1910. (6) Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident, Lingah, to Resident, No. 151 dated the 13th October 1910. (7) Shaikh of Sargah to Residency Agent, Bargah, dated the 19th October 1910. (8) Resident to German Consul, No. 3043, dated the 13th November 1910. I do not think I need trouble Government, at all events at this stage, with the details of my correspondence with Khan Bahadur Agha Badr, Residency Agent at Lingali, in connection with the examination of Dr. Distemann , s communication ; suffice it to say that the claim appears on enquiry to be almost entirely fictitious—the Residency Agent believing that the only articles removed were 30 rafters (chandals) which are still probably forthcoming on the island. 3. It will be seen from Mr. New’s letter of 13th October (enclosure No. 6 ) that Hassan and Abdulla were obstructive as usual, refusing to appear until summoned and then declining to answer questions on the ground that they had appointed Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. their Agent. But they said enough to make the extravagant nature of their claim apparent. In reply to Dr. Listemann it seemed to me to be unnecessary for me to touch upon the details or merits of the claim, his title to discuss it with me at all being disputed. I have, however, seen him since the date of my letter and informed him unofficially that though I was not prepared to admit Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. as Hassan’s Agents, I should be quite willing, if Hassan Samiyeh lodged his claim as a Britisbjsubjeet in the ordinary way, to show him (Dr. Listemann) informally the proceedings in the suit, and suggested that, if he wanted to get the case quickly disposed of as I did, he could co-operate, by advising Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. not to encourage Hassan in his objectionable attitude towards His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate at Lingah. I now await Dr. Listemann’s reply. j i i Bouchire, le 6 Aodt 1910. J.

From—R. tL Nuw, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul and Assistant Residents Lingah, To—The Political Resident and Consul-General, Bushire. With reference to your No. 299 of the 30th September 1910, to Khan Bahadur Agha Badr, regarding the property supposed to have been stolen from the Island of Abu Musa, I have the honour to inform you that to day I summoned Hassan bin Ali Samaiyeh who was accompanied by his son Abdulla, and asked them many questions as to when the items contained in the list were taken to the Island, and by whom they are supposed to have been stolen. 2. Both Hassan and Abdulla refused to answer any questions, saying their case was in the hands of their appointed Agents Messrs. R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. They however acknowledged the following points:— (1) That all the items contained in the list were the property of Hassan bin Ali Samaiyeh. (2) That the items contained in the list were taken to the Island at various times, covering a period of about 14 years, i.e., from the time they commenced removing the oxide. 3. Questioned as to how they presumed that precisely this amount of property contained in their list, which they acknowledged to have submitted through Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. was stolen, they say the list represents the amount of property which was left on the Island when they were turned out. Further, that when Abdulla visited the Island with Agha Badr in April last, he noticed that the roof of the godown had fallen in, and that their property had been removed. Abdulla alleges too that he made enquiries from the Shaikh’s Agent on the Island who told him that the property had been earned off by Arab sailors who came there from time to time. Agha Badr says this is false, and it seems highly improbable that the Shaikh’s Agent could make such a statement considering his business there was to guard the property. 4. Agha Badr is writing fully in respect to each item contained in the list. Dated 15th Shawal 1323, the 19th October 1910. From— Shaikh Suggar bin Khalid, Chief of Shargah, To —Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif. After compliments—l have duly received the letter from the Resident, Colonel Cox, and understood its contents. As regards the oxide remaining at Abu Musa island and excavated from the mine %y Hassan-bin-Samaiyeh, a discussion took place on this subject before and I expressed my willingness to permit its shipment. Now that the British Agent, Badr, comes there to superintend the shipment, it does not matter, and I have nothing to say against the reply I gave to the Resident. I sent Shaikh Khalid previously to look after the mines on the island and he found that apart from the oxide taken by the Bin Samaiyeh, there remained a heap of oxide from which the Government took a sample. ^ So the Bin Samaiyeh should not meddle with it as it is my property and neither the Bin Samaiyeh nor anyone else has any right thereon. Shaikh Khalid will visit the island and arrange for the people who will have to superintend the shipment. I hope there will remain no further interest for Bin Samaiyeh which may cause trouble for all. I shall write an answer to the Resident’s reply, but I address you this for the time being.SECRET .

Grey to state, for the Information of the Secretary of State for India, that he has had under considera tion the second meraorandura of the German Government, enclosed in a note dated December 4th 1909 from the German Ambassador, on the subject of the cancellation of the red oxide concession at Abu Musa. Sir E. Grey has always intended to postpone de tailed criticism of the German case until careful local enquiries have been made regarding the new and import ant evidence now brought forward by the German Govern ment. In view, however, of the fact that the British Resident in the Persian Gulf has been unable, as stated in his telegram of September 27th, to make sat- iO aun* isfactory progress in the collection of evidence, and 0 NfiylSIO i^&amp;lA orFiCE-J -t y.n g-nirh as the question of delay cannot fail to have an important bearing upon the amount of compensation which The Under Secretary of State, India Office.( 294 / 10 ) which may he payable as damages, - a period of nine months having already elapsed since the date of my letter of January 25th, - Sir E. Grey considers that it may be expedient to lay before the Earl of Crev/e certain observations in regard to a possible settle ment of the question in dispute* Sir E. Grey does not now propose to review the circumstances which led up to the cancellation of the lease by the Sheikh of Shargah: but he considers, for reasons which are fully set forth in printed minutes of which copies were furnished to your Depart ment in the month of February last, that His Majesty's Governnent might safely make an offer to the German Government to give Messrs. Woenckhaus and Company the same position that they held under their contract of June 1906 commercially, if means can be devised that will safeguard British political interests. He further considers that Messrs. Woenckhaus' claim is valid in so far as it relates to the loss sustained in consequence of Hassan Samaiyeh's breach of2) ( 294 / 10 ) of contract to sell the output of the oxide mines at a fixed price per ton; this breach of contract is due to the cancellation of the concession by the Sheikh of Shargah; and the German Government have apparently full knowledge that the Sheikh acted with the approv al, and indeed at the instigation of His Majesty's Government. In these circumstances Sir E. Grey is disposed to think that proposals to the German Government on the following lines might possibly meet the require ments of the situation; but, inasmuch as the Govern ment of India is primarily concerned, more especially in regard to the payment of compensation, these pro- ——— posals are of course subject to the ultimate decision of Lord Crewe l) The Sheikh of Shargah to grant a new conces sion to Hassan Samaiyeh and Ahdul Latif (the son of the former, Abdulla hen Hassan being excladed for per sonal reasons urged by Colonel Cox) of oxide mining rights on Abu Musa, so as to enable them to carry out their contract with Messrs. Woenckhaus.( 294 / 10 ) 2) The amount of damages suffered 'by Messrs. Woenckhaus through the interruption of the contract to he referred to some British tribunal, and the amount to he paid through His Majesty's Government on hehalf of the Government of India. In order to safeguard the Sheikh of Shargah, the new concession under l) would have to provide that no share in the enterprise was to he transferred to an other person without the Sheikh's consent, and should also give him access to the hooks of the company and control over the working of the mines: the partners in the previous concession, up to the date of its can cellation, being all British subjects, it could fairly he claimed that the terms of the new concession do not affect the German Government who are merely con cerned with the execution of Messrs. Woenckhaus' con tract. If the German Governnent were to decline to ac cept these proposals. His Majesty's Government might with greater facility take the line that the right of the( 294 / 10 ) the Sheikh to cancel a concession held by British subjects was not a matter which they could consent to submit to arbitration, while the injury caused to Messrs. Woenckhaus by the failure of a British subject to carry out his contract was a matter which could be adequately dealt with before the judicial tribunals, a course for which His Majesty's Government would pro vide every facility. In conclusion, I am to express Sir E. Grey's con fident hope that Lord Crewe will accept the view that the payment of damages will devolve not upon His Majesty's Government but upon the Governnent of India* the original action of the British Resident, in his capacity as agent of the Governnent of India, was taken under the instructions of that Governnent, while the delay which has arisen in preparing the replies to the German notes is in no case due, as will appear from a comparison of dates, to this Department, where, both in 1908 and in February of the present year, the utmost( 294 / 10 ) utmost promptitude was manifested. I am.

Minutes respecting Abu Musa. Section 1. /!/ vv /' ' ''' 1 aS^H^to MAJOR COX paid me a visit yesterday, and, as the result of our conversation, and of a further examination of the recent German memorandum, and of the earlier papers in the case, I cannot help feeling that Sir E. Grey would be well advised to make an attempt to settle the dispute by a compromise. The more one goes into the case, the less, it seems to me, is it worth fighting about; the longer the dispute goes on, the larger the bill for damages that His Majesty’s Government will in the end have to pay. of Wiinc | £ h aus ’ s c ] a ; m i s that for compensation for the loss be has sustained by reason of Hassan Samaiyeh’s breach of his contract to sell to him the output of the oxide mines on the island at a fixed price per ton Hassan Samaiyeh broke his contract because the sheikh cancelled the concession which Hassan and his partners held. The Germans know quite well that the sheikh cancelled that concession with the approval, if not at the instigation, of the representatives of His Britannic Majesty, and therefore the German Government take up M onckhauss claim, and put it forward as one which His Majesty’s Government are bound to pay. 3 The object in view in getting the concession cancelled by the sheikh was political : it was to prevent Germany, through Wonckhaus, from getting a monopoly and foothold in the Island of Abu Musa, which might have been pushed and developed into a political occupation. That object has been achieved, but another consequence has also resulted, viz., that Wonckhaus has been prevented from trading m the oxide, and to such trading there need be no objection on political grounds. 4. If the British representatives in the Persian Gulf had known all that they know now about the contract with Wonckhaus, it would not have been necessary for the sheikh to cancel the concession : it would have been sufficient for him to supervise the carrying out of the mining operations on the islands by the partnership, so as to ma ~e quite sure that Germany did not gradually achieve the actual occupation ot the mine, and subsequently of the island. 5. It seems to me, therefore, that we might quite safely make an otter to the German Government to give Wbnckhaus the same position that he held under his contract commercially, if means can be devised that will safeguard our political 6 I think that an offer on the following lines would fulfil the above requiie- ments :— (1.) The sheikh to grant a new concession to Hassan and his two former colleagues of the oxide mining rights on Abu Musa, so as to enable them to carry out the Wbnckhaus contract. The concession would be to the partnership as constituted at the time of the contract, thereby excluding the individual (Brown) who purchased a share on behalf of Wbnckhaus after the cancellation of the concession by the sheikh. 7 (2 ) A reference to some British judicial tribunal as to the amount ot damages suffered by Wbnckhaus through the interruption of his contract, and payment of such sum by His Majesty’s Government. It is most desirable to avoid the fixing of this sum through the diplomatic channel. q To safeguard the sheikh (and also His Majesty’s Government), the new concession under (1) would have to provide that no share m the enterprise was to S transferred to-another person without the sheikh’s consent, and should also gave him ™ to the books and control over the mode of working the mines. The partners m toe previous concession (including Brown, who bought after the cancellation) are all British rdects, so that we can fairly claim that the terms of the new concession are no concern whoever of Germany’s, and that all that she is concerned with is the carrying^ut^f the. Wonckhaus^contoact.^ ^ amount of tl damages would be fought A A I think the best course would be to send up one of the judges from either' 1 ZanzUiai or Constantinople; this might entail the passing of an order in [2643 d —1] Bcouncil, but I think that would be immaterial. Major Cox presides in the senior court on the coasts of the Persian Gulf, but he has already been concerned in the case in other capacities, and the Germans would be entitled to object to the matter being settled by him. # . 10. The offer of such a settlement, proceeding as it does on commercial lines, wilU probably not be very welcome to Germany, whose object is, no doubt, to drag the political aspects to the front. At the same time it would not be easy for her to find adequate grounds for refusing it, and if she did refuse it she would, I think, be in a less favourable position for fighting the case afterwards, as it would render it easier for His Majesty’s Government to take the line that the right of the sheikh to cancel a concession held by British subjects was certainly not a matter which Great Britain could consent to arbitrate with Germany at The Hague, and that the injury caused to Wonckhaus by the failure of a British subject to carry out his contract was a matter which could be adequately dealt with before the judicial tribunals, a course for which His Majesty’s Government would provide every facility. 11. The advantage of compromising the dispute, if it can be done, on the lines suggested above, instead of relying solely on the grounds set out in the preceding paragraph, is that His Majesty’s Government will in any case have to pay the compensa tion, and that it will considerably reduce the amount if it only represents damages for three years’ interruption, instead of damages for total and permanent breach of the contract. Furthermore, it is desirable for the sake of the sheikh that mining opera tions should be resumed as soon as possible, and unless arrangements are going to be made to enable the Wonckhaus contract to be carried out, the mining must be put into the hands of some British firm, and it would look as if our object had been to crush German trade rather than to prevent Germany acquiring political interests. As Major Cox is in London, I think it would be a good thing to ascertain whether he thinks a compromise on these lines would be desirable, and, if so, whether it is feasible. C. J. B. H Foreign Office, February 4, 1910. q/&gt; With reference to the last paragraph of the foregoing minute, Major Cox is now studying the German note and has talked it over with Mr. Hurst. It might assist him if this minute were sent to him privately at once. H. N, Foreign Office, February 5, 1910. B. P. M. L. M. My notes accompany. February 12, 1910. P. Z. C. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Notes by Major Cox respecting the Abu Musa Case. I STUDIED the German rejoinder on receipt, and after reducing my ideas to writing provisionally, I discussed it informally with Mr. Hurst, and have now received his minute for comment. I should wish to mention in the first instance that when I was in Tehran in November, Count Quadt, the German Minister, went out of his way to be gracious and hospitable to me, and in the course of one of several informal conversations which we had, he referred incidentally to the Abu Musa case. I took the opportunity of assuring him then that there had never been any desire on the part of the Sheikh of Shargah or the British residency at Bushire (as my present German colleague at Bushire seemed persuaded was the case) to prevent Wonckhaus altogether from trading in Abu Musa oxide, and I expressed my regret personally, as a local official, that the dispute had assumed such protracted proportions. He in turn asked me to accept his emphatic personal assurances that in taking up Wonckhaus’s case his Government had had no political motive whatever, but simply desired tosecure for their trade and traders a fair field and no favour. I replied that those two premises being recognised, it would seem quite possible to settle the case speedily by some friendly compromise, and that I hoped that this course would be attempted. Count Quadt professed to be surprised and pleased to know that as local official I did not hold that view, and joined in the hope that the controversy would find settlement in that way. _ . . Count Quadt is habitually fair in speech, but is believed to be not quite so amicably inclined in practice, and the fact that the German rejoinder, presented two months later, offers no suggestion of compromise, makes it possible that they may not prove amenable to a speedy give-and-take settlement; but I have thought it as well to mention the above conversation, as ic was in a similar frame of mind as regards the question of compromise that I approached the present German communication and subsequently discussed the position with Mr. Hurst. . Before commenting on points of the latter’s minute, I beg to offer some preliminary observations from my own point of view upon the general tenor of the German rejoinder of the 3rd January, 1910. Detailed comment I have recorded separately. They have evidently taken a great deal of trouble over it, and it reads well if read by itself; but if it is examined by the light of what has gone before on the record, it will be found, I think, that most of the arguments used are simply repetition, and are already answered, while th# fresh evidence adduced is either impugnable, or does not seriously affect the principal grounds of our case. They quote one document (to which I refer in a separate memorandum of detailed comment hereto attached) the grant ot a lease of mica or gypsum deposits by Salim—which, if in order and known to the ruling sheikh, would show that Salim made grants as tenant at will, as well as qua regent, but none of the German arguments appear to me to shake our contention that Salim was not the private owner either of the island or the mines, but simply enjoyed the usufruct at the ruling sheikh’s will, and subject to resumption at any moment. When we first took up this case with the German Government we endeavoured to insist on the premise that it was for the present purely commercial in its aspect ; that Wonckhaus should put in his claim against Hassan, or the concessionnaires generally, for breach of contract; and that until he had taken that course there was no justifica tion for going behind the commercial elements of the case and bringing it on to political ground. I hope we can still maintain this attitude. It is clear, however, from the present German communication that they are anxious to push the political aspect of the case as much as they can, with an appeal to The Hague if they do not get what they want—a proceeding which would delay settlement indefinitely. . . . . , . . In fact, we appear to have arrived precisely in the position anticipated m my despatch of the 28th December, 1907, from the Foreign Office to the India Office, the paragraph commencing:— “ If the German Government argue that the legality of the sheikh’s action would be very suitable matter to refer to arbitration, . . . .” I beg reference to that despatch, and presume that were the dispute to be pursued on existing lines we should adopt one of the alternative courses of action adumbrated in the paragraphs following the passage above quoted ; and that we should ultimately agree to 'grant or get Wonckhaus some compensation, either from Hassan Samaiyeh or the concessionnaires as a whole, or from the sheikh, as we might feel called upon. The object of the sheikh and ourselves was, not to prevent onckhaus from trading in Abu Musa oxide, but to prevent his getting a monopoly and a footing on the island^ and to o-ain this object it was foreseen that compensation might have to be paid ; and no doubt ft will; but our original purpose, the prevention of a monopoly and of German interference on Abu Musa Island, wifi have been attained. It seems to me that we cannot possibly admit the validity of the colourable , p 0 f a share in the concession itself (after cancellation) to Wonckhaus, and a consequent right of Wonckhaus to sue the sheikh as one of the concessionnaires Toucan cede this would be to concede that the cancellation by the sheikh was invalid and oreatly to weaken and complicate our case. ,, r But in any case it is clear that if the controversy is pursued on the lines hitherto employed, the preparation of a detailed reply to the present German hitherto etnp y 1 r ; f . not severa i months; while if the case is ulti- rejoinder will oc p • tef . ore final settlement is arrived at. EShS'; “oS. 2 XS/R- Ali mI» will 1 . M- •«&gt; s “‘4 Sagar will continue to be deprived of all income from the island, and their attitude will become sulky and difficult. It is submitted that the case is at present no subject for reference to The Hague, and is solvable by commercial settlement or compromise. Count Metternich’s communication to His Majesty’s Foreign Office, dated the 4th * December, 1909, claims that— 1. Wonckhaus should be compensated for damage sustained by non-fulfilment of his contract with Hassan. 2. The firm of Wonckhaus and Co. deserve compensation as shareholders in the mining concession for loss suffered by suspension of their operations. Perhaps the position could be discussed with the German Embassy on some such lines as the following :— We should in the first instance again press the view that the case is essentially a a commercial one ; that there has never been any desire to prevent Wonckhaus trading in the oxide ; and that if the settlement of the dispute continues to be sought on the deliberate methods hitherto employed, months, if not years, must elapse before it is laid to rest; meanwhile the pecuniary interests of all concerned will suffer, and a chronic element of friction will continue to exist. His Majesty’s Gm/ernment are most anxious to obviate this, as, no doubt, the German Government are also, and they suggest that an expeditious settlement of the case be sought in the interests of all parties. His Majesty’s Government agree that whether or not Hassan Samaiyeh had the power to enter into such a transaction, and although the secretive tactics employed by the German firm naturally laid them under suspicion, Messrs. Wonckhaus could not be blamed for obtaining such a contract as that executed on the 1st June, 1906, and would no doubt be entitled to receive relief in the shape of compensation from some source for any hond fide loss which he could prove before the judicial tribunal concerned to have suffered by the non-fulfilment of the said contract by the contractors. All the parties who might conceivably be held, alternatively, to be liable to pay such compensation to Messrs. Wonckhaus are under British protection, and His Majesty s Government will be prepared to take measures to recover such amounts as the said court may hold to be due. Then would come the question of the precise terms to be offered, and I am brought to Mr. Hurst’s minute. He goes considerably further than I should have felt able to recommend myself. I think the points on which our views diverge, or in regard to which I have any suggestion to make, will be shown most conveniently if I take the liberty of numbering his paragraphs and commenting on them seriatim. Comment on Mr. Hurst’s Minute. Paragraph 1. —I agree. Paragraph 2 {last clause). We have informed the Germans that we considered the sheikh s action justified, but ostensibly we do not accept responsibility for it, and I suppose vis-a-vis the German Government we should maintain that attitude and ostensibly “ recover” compensation rather than “ pay ” it. Paragraph 3—Our original objects as understood by myself and the Government of India were— 1. To prevent Wonckhaus getting a monopoly. 2. To prevent him getting a footing in the island. His Majesty s Government, however, decided not to raise the monopoly question. I have elsewhere ventured to inquire whether this point could be reconsidered, as, if we do not use the argument, the Sheikh of Shargah’s action is less defensible. Paragraph 4. Ihe cancellation of the contract to Wonckhaus, or its revision so as to exclude monopoly, might have been sufficient in the first instance, but the German firm would, I think, have opposed that just as much as the cancellation of the con cession ; as shown by their action in getting a share in the concession to strengthen their right to protect the contract. Paragraph 5.— The “same position,” except that it must exclude any right to a monopoly of the output. We cannot afford to ignore this question of monopoly. It is true that Wonckhaus5 IT n'T has been able to do little good with the oxide hitherto, partly from inexperience of the stuff, and partly, perhaps, from ill-luck in getting an indifferent lot for his last shipment. It is probable, too, that he could not have success with it for a considerable time to come, especially if we can get him to ship what is already mined before he is given any more ^freshly mined. It will be realised, however, from Mr. Frank Strick’s letter, of which I attach a copy, that there may be an important future before the Abu Musa industry, and we need to take due account of that fact. Paragraph 6.—I do not quite like the idea of the new concession being granted to the same three concessionnaires, and would have preferred other individuals, if it were considered possible. I realise, however, that the German firm and Government will not be inclined to throw their friends Hassan and Abdalla Samaiyeh overboard ; that the grounds adduced by Mr. Hurst in paragraph 11 of his minute are weighty, and that it may be necessary to admit Hassan, in order to simplify the question of compen sation. But is it necessary to include Abdalla? He is a troublesome rascal, always up to some mischief or intrigue, and I should welcome his exclusion from the con cession itself, and so, I am sure, would the Sheikh of Shargah and the third partner, Esa We should have to see that the sheikh (cum Salim) gotjx fair price for the new concession. He could not be expected to grant it for the equivalent of 20/. per annum as at present. Paragraph 7.—According to my idea, the compensation would be “ recovered ” rather than “paid” by His Majesty’s Government, but I realise the convenience and desirability drawn attention toby Mr. Hurst, of having the compensation fixed judicially rather than diplomatically^ Paragraph 8.—I agree ; but I suggest that it should be stipulated that concession naires should have no authority to sell a monopoly of the output. Paragraph 9.—It is most important, in my judgment, not to let this dispute be removed at any stage from the sphere of jurisdiction of the Government of India and their representative, qua resident in the Gulf, to which it, properly speaking, belongs. For this reason the High Court of Bombay seems indicated as the tribunal whose function it would be to depute a judicial officer to try the case. Paragraph 10.—My views coincide with Mr. Hurst’s. The refusal by Germany of a fair commercial settlement or compromise would greatly operate in our favour in the event of the dispute going to The Hague. Paragraph 11 (vide Paragraph 6).—As I have said, the prospect of the concession going back to these same concessionnaires is an unpleasant one, and will not, I think, be palatable to the skeikh ; but I cannot deny the force of Mr. Hurst’s observations in this paragraph. I trust, however, that in any case it will be possible to eliminate Abdalla. If the suggestions of Mr. Hurst and myself in the direction of commercial settle ment or compromise are to any extent entertained, I would venture to suggest that the precise lines which the wording of the new concession and contract might follow should be discussed verbally—by departmental representatives in consultation—and then resubmitted for consideration. P. z. COX. February 12, 1910. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. to Major Cox. Baltic House, Leadenhall Street, London, Dear Major Cox, February 8, 1910. DEFERRING to my conversation with you a few days ago, I have now had an opportunitv of going into our correspondence with Messrs. A. and 1. J. Malcolm, of Bushire, during 1906 and 1907, from which it would appear that early in 1906 Haii Hassan Ben Ali Sumaya sold to Messrs. Robert Wonckhaus and Co. a parcel of about 700 tons of Abu Musa oxide, which was bagged and shipped from the island to Kurrachee. where it was transhipped for Hamburg, I believe, in some ol the Hamburg- American Line steamers (see copy of A. and I. J. Malcolms letter of the 28th Apiil, 1906, herewith enclosed).^ * Not printed. [2643 rf—1] C QAs the above shipment proved to be of good quality, and commanded a ready sale at about 55s. per ton c.i.f. Hamburg, a contract was made in June 1906 between Sumaya and Wonckhaus (copy of which I enclose*) whereby the former agreed to ship, and the latter to purchase, a minimum quantity of 2,000 tons, and a maximum quantity of 5,000 tons of oxide per annum, over a period of four years, the basis of the contract being'^^ that the quality of the mineral was to be equal to that of the 700 tons trial shipment. Against this contract two shipments were made, viz., about 800 to 1,000 tons by the “Teutonia” in July 1907, and about 1,800 tons by the steamship “Louise” in ! April 1908. As the former vessel foundered on her homeward voyage, I shall only deal with the parcel brought by the steamer “ Louise.” So far as I have been able to gather, after a lapse of two years, there is still a stock of some 700 tons now lying at Hamburg, which Messrs Trauen, Sturken, and Co., the agents for Messrs. Wonckhaus, find considerable difficulty in selling, even in very small quantities, owing to the quality being in every way inferior to the trial shipment above referred to, being much darker in colour, and having only about 60 per cent, of its staining power. They are now offering this stock at about 48s. f.o.b. Hamburg without finding buyers. In my opinion, which has been confirmed by one of the largest buyers, the difference in value between the trial shipment and standard Ormuz quality is about 12s. 6d. per ton. Consequently the best quality Abu Musa would be worth (theoretically) about 30s. per ton f.o.b., as compared with Ormuz oxide at 42s. 6d. per ton f.o.b. Presuming that the oxide could be shipped equal in quality to the trial parcel, it would, in my opinion, to a considerable extent supplant Ormuz oxide, in view of the fact that its cost f.o.b. is about 27s. per ton less than the price of the latter; and it should be borne in mind that the annual consumption of this class of oxide in Europe and America does not exceed 6,500 to 7,000 tons. In conclusion, as regards Abu Musa, the position, as I understand it, is briefly as follows: — Had the mineral shipped by Sumaya been equal in every respect to the trial shipment, the contract would have been of considerable value to Messrs. W^onckhaus, as the mineral could have been delivered, c.i.f., Hamburg at about 31 a*. and sold at about 555. per ton, or a net profit of, say, 245 . per ton ; but, with the primitive methods of mining adopted by Sumaya, it is very doubtful whether he could have supplied the desired quality. With regard to Ormuz, as far as I have been able to ascertain, there is still a stock at Avonmouth of about 1,500 to 2,000 tons; and if to this is added the shipment of about 5 000 tons now being made by the steam-ship “ Cliftonian,” it brings up the tota supplies to about 6,500 to 7,000 tons, which quantity is sufficient, apart from anv possible competition from Abu Musa, to satisfy the trade in Germany, England, and America for over twelve months. Doubtless a great deal of the foregoing, being ancient history, will not be of much mteiest to you, but I think no harm can be done by laying the whole position as clearly as I can before you. Yours sincerely, FRANK C. STRtCK. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Sketch of the Abu Musa Case from its commencement up to January 1910, with some comment on German Rejoinder. Phase I. The Events and Grounds which underlay the Action of the Sheikh of Shargah in withdrawing the Concession. IxN the summer of 1906 the intention of the Hamburg-Amerika line to enter into competition for the carrying trade to the Persian Gulf at an early date became known, in June 1906, about the same time, a report emanating from a British newspaper correspondent m Constantinople was published, to the effect that Germany was •Not printed.i negotiating with the Porte for the lease of the little-known Island ot Halool in the Persian Gulf, with the idea of placing a coaling depot there. As tending to show that the report might have some foundation, it was remarked that curiously enough Halool was the only one among the numerous islets in the Gulf ^to which Turkey could conceivably base a colourable claim, from the fact that the 'mainland nearest to the island was the coast of Katar, on which the Porte keep a small garrison (at A1 Bida), though we have always declined to recognise their juris diction there. I understand that any such design as that suggested was denied by the German press or Government ; in any case, the publicity given to the matter had the effect of nipping any possible intrigue in the bud. A few weeks after the above incident, news was received of the grant by Hassan Samaiyeh to the German firm of an exclusive contract in connection with the Abu Musa oxide concession. In communicating the facts, as far as they were then known, to the Government of India, I expressed the view that the grant ot a monopoly without limit of time gave the Sheikh of Shargah reasonable grounds for withdrawing the concession, and that although the Abu Musa oxide might not prove to be of great commercial value, it was politically important to prevent the creation by Germany of vested interests in the Gulf, such as this oxide monopoly might prove to be. The Government of India were of the same opinion, and, apart from the commercial aspect of the question, took count of the fact that where oxide could be conveniently stored and shipped, there coal could be handled with equal facility. As a matter of fact, the contingency of Germany acquiring a coaling station in the Gulf and her right to do so if she wished were frankly alluded to in the German press in connection with this dispute (vide Berlin Embassy despatch No. 559, dated the 27th December, 1907). I would emphasise the fact that there was never any desire altogether to prevent the German firm from trading in Abu Musa oxide in competition with others. All that was objected to was the acquisition by Wonckhaus of a monopoly and of rights in the mines themselves ; and these latter rights they claimed. It was with the idea of preventing these two possible contingencies that the Sheikh of Shargah, on learning the state of the case, decided to cancel the concession. He was the more inclined to do this by the fact that he had already nearly lost the island on a previous occasion through the action of the Belgian Director of Persian Customs at Bushire, who had endeavoured to hoist a flag and instal a customs post there on behalf of the Persian Government. The grounds which the sheikh put forward in intimating to Hassan the cancellation of the lease were that the nature of the contract given to Wonckhaus involved a monopoly. It was consequently such as he had no right to give, at all events without first consulting himself (the ruling Sheikh of Shargah) and the third partner, Esa; that the said partner did not agree ; and that he himself objected to the nature of the contract. Phase II.— The original German Statement of Claim, dated December 31, 1907. It is to be noted that before presenting their claim to us on behalf of Wonckhaus the German Government apparently attempted to get the Persian Government to claim sovereignty over the Island of Abu Musa. The salient issues raised in their claim were :— Issue (a). —That the mines were owned by Sheikh Salim personally and had been leased by him in his own right. Issue (b). —That the concession had been approved by the ruling Sheikh of Shargah, and that the terms of it were such that the latter had no power to cancel it. Issue (c).—That the subsidiary contract of the 1st June, 1906, for the sale ot oxide passed by Hassan to W onckhaus did not require the sheikh’s approval. Issue (d). —That the said contract had the approval of the third partner, Esa. Issue (e). —That the sheikh’s illegal action had injured Wonckhaus, not only as buyer of oxide, but as partner in the mining concession, they having purchased a share in it. In the latter capacity the German firm claimed compensation, not from the concessionnaires, but as one of the concessionnaires from the Sheikh of Shaigab.8 Phase III .—British Reply to German Claim, dated July 10, 1908. In reply to the German claim we contended:— Issue (a) .—That the mines were not the private property of Salim, nor had he leased them in his own right of private owner, but in his capacity as regent. Issue (b ).—We agreed that the concession, or permit, was approved by the rulino* sheikh, but maintained that it was terminable by either side, and that Sheikh Sagar, as ruling Sheikh of Shargah, was, in such a matter, a law unto himself and was within his rights in putting an end to the concession. Issue (c).—As to the subsidiary contract of sale given to Wonckhaus, we contended that Hassan’s authority did not cover the grant of such an instrument and that, as the primary ground for Wonckhaus’s claim was the failure of Hassan to fulfil his engagements, the obvious remedy of the German firm was an action at law against the vendors. Issu e(d ).—We produced evidence to show that Esa, when he knew the whole terms of the subsidiary contract granted to Hassan (and found that it gave a monopoly), did not approve of it, and was justified in the course he took. Issue (e ).—We refused to admit Wonckhaus’s locus standi as a partner in the original concession, as he had no share in it at the time of its cancellation and the colourable acquisition of one afterwards for the purposes of this case could not be recognised as bond fide. It is to be noted that in framing our reply on the above lines His Majesty’s Government did not make use of the “ monopoly ” argument as Esa and the sheikh had, and I was warned to that effect. I did not understand our reason for dropping this argument at the time, but I now see that it was then held that that argument would be inconsistent with our contemporaneous endeavour to obtain a monopoly of the Ormuz oxide for a British firm. I venture, with much respect, to hope that the position as regards this point will be reconsidered. Can the fact that the “ civilised” Government of Persia happen to deal in monopolies and that British and other foreign subjects are entitled to benefit by the fact be fairly adduced as a reason for precluding the primitive sheikhs of the Trucial Coast from safeguarding their interests by refusing habitually to grant monopolies except under the advice of the protecting Power? These ignorant Arab sheikhs would get themselves into hopeless difficulties if not looked after in such matters. Phase IV .—German Rejoinder, dated January 3, 1910. Referring to the same mam issues the German Government now make reioinder on the following lines :— ( a )‘ lhe y produce evidence which they consider supports the contention that Salim granted the original concession in his own absolute right as formal owner, not only of the mines and other property in the island, but of the island itself. As an alternative they claim that even if it be possible to doubt Salim’s formal ownership of the island, he is proved to have exercised the full right of disposal of the usufruct, just like an owner, both with and against the consent of the ruling sheikh. &amp; f.s'.sn, {bj. —That the ongmal concession was approved by the ruling sheikh we have aiways conceded. What we contended was that he was justified in cancelling it. Ihe German reply again presses the argument that the ruling sheikh (or the owner of the island, whoever he may be) had no power either according to the terms of the lease, or according to religious or commercial law, to revoke the mining rights of the concessionnaires . that they were in fact irrevocable. Also, from the administrative point of view, they contend that the sheikh s action had no justification. Issue (c). As regards the subsidiary 7 contract, they argue that there is no valid reason for any action at law by Wonckhaus against the vendors, for no action of the latter has been harmful ro Messrs. Wonckhaus; it is simply Sheikh’s Sugar’s action which has injured them. They claim that the Memorandum of Association drawn up gave Hassan full authority for all he did. Issue (d). i hey produce evidence in support of the contention that the third partner, Esa, approved the contract to Wonckhaus. Issue (e). As to the colourable transfer of a share in the original concession by Hassan to Biown, and Brown to W^onckhaus and Co., they sav very little. Theysimply contend that it was a piece of defensive tactics justified by the circum stances. Issue (/).—They introduce the fresh and interesting contention that the Sheikh ofShargah has no jurisdiction over the concessionaires inter se, as they reside in Lingah, O in the jurisdiction of the British consulate-general, and not in that of the resident in the Persian Gulf. Brief Comment on chief items of fresh Evidence in German Rejoinder. It is impossible that the German rejoinder can be fully dealt with in detail, except on the spot and with vernacular documents at hand for reference, but the following preliminary general observations are offered in comment, pending examination on the spot :— As regards Issue (a ).—Certain new items of evidence are adduced to prove Salim’s private ownership of the island. 1. The exercise by Salim of the right to jetsam and flotsam. These Arab sheikbs have no clear idea on such subjects, and the exercise of this right by Salim is quite compatible with an arrangement or understanding between uncle and nephew under which Sagar allows Salim to enjoy what income there may be from the island. We have not stated anything to the contrary, and this position is compatible with what is stated in my note on the history of Abu Musa. (Appendix 6 of our case.) 2. The first and rejected draft, dated the Gth April, 1898, of the oxide concession, in which Salim uses expressions suggesting formal ownership. This may equally well have been rejected, because Salim found that he could not make good such pretensions, and thought it better to modify them. 3. Receipt of revenue from mother-of-pearl and “canary-seed.” (“Canary-seed” must, I think, be a mistranslation of some unfamiliar Arabic word, probably “ zinni,” the giant oyster, as distinct from the ordinary pearl oyster.) By the same analogy as that drawn in the case of jetsam and flotsam, as this payment was an item of revenue from the island which the uncle Salim enjoyed under his understanding with his nephew the ruler, it was quite in order that Sbeikh Sagar, in his commercial capacity as a member of the mining concession, should share the payment made by his partners to Salim on this or any other account which could be regarded as income of the island. Thus Salim did not exercise the right to usufruct adversely to the ruling sheikh as the German rejoinder claims, but adversely to Sagar, qua member of the mining concession. 4. Lease by Salim of “mica” deposits on the 26th December, 1898. “Mica” should, I think, read “ gypsum.” There is no marketable mica on the island, as far as I know. This is the most inconvenient piece of evidence which they have produced, because it tends to show that Salim granted the concession as tenant, and not as regent. The fact probably is that the ruling sheikh would probably give Salim a free hand so long as the latter’s management of the island did not prejudice his sovereign rights or obligations to the British Government, and so long as the income derivable from it did not increase to a figure in excess of Salim’s just deserts or needs. It had now done so. The alternative German claim that, even if Salim’s formal ownership be doubted, his practical enjoyment of the usufruct is proved, will, I think, have to be conceded, in fact has been conceded, but with the reservation that such enjoyment is with the consent and permission of the ruling sheikh. The instance they quote as tending to prove that Salim exercised the privilege adversely to the ruling sbeikh is not in point, as I have pointed out above. The personal relation of the one sheikh to the other must be remembered. Salim must be thirty years older than his nephew Sheikh Sagar, and was himself ruling sheikh for eighteen years. Then the swing of the tribal pendulum placed the young nephew in the sheikhship. The present sheikh is naturally in a very delicate position towards his aged relative and predecessor, and, as long as the latter remains loyal and inoffensive, he is content to let him enjoy any income derivable from Abu Musa so long as it remains inconsiderable, as it has hitherto. The moment the income becomes, in his opinion, unreasonably great for Salim, or Salim becomes troublesome, the ruling sheikh is in a position to alter the arrangement arbitrarily in any way he pleases short of oppression, in which case we should give Salim our friendly offices in obtaining [2643 d—l] D10 reasonable consideration. The most obvious evidences of the character of Salim’s tenure or tenancy of the island are :— Firstly, the fact that, if he were private owner of the island or mines in his own right, he must have acquired them from somewhere, and would have the ordinary deeds in support of his title. But he says he has nothing of the sort, and makes no * such claim. If the Germans know or think that he has, why do they not allude to such or ask for discovery of them ? Again, if Salim owned in his own right he could will the property away; but I am sure he would not claim to do so, nor would his nephew tolerate such a claim for a moment. The Bahrein principality recently furnished a case which bears on this question. Sheikh Ali, nephew of the ruling sheikh, was deported in 1904 for unruly conduct. He was at the time in the enjoyment of certain State property. On his deportation the ruling sheikh resumed the property, and the nephew on his return could not claim it back; he was simply dependent on his uncle ? s kind consideration. These petty potentates have to support their relations, and the most convenient way of doing so is to give them, as long as they behave loyally, the enjoyment of State property instead of cash, which is a scarce commodity with them. Secondly, our action in rescuing Abu Musa from Persian annexation in 1904, was taken long before this dispute was ever dreamed of. It was taken at the instance of the ruling sheikh, not of Sheikh Salim. Salim made no attempt to pose to us as owner of the island at that time. Issue (b ).—We do not dispute the fact that the ruling sheikh approved the concession. In support of their contention that the latter had no power to revoke the rights of the “ mining company,” certain recorded opinions are now adduced, and it is argued that the concession is unterminable by the grantor either by religious or commercial law. It is also contended, as before, that Sheikh Sagar’s action, if viewed from the administrative standpoint, was unjustifiable. Evidence such as that produced by them can be bought to any extent. Brown and Dr. Listemann have simply gone about getting hold of certain “ leading merchants” and others, who, as far as I can recognize their identity, are known to have specific animus against us or our agent at Lingah. It is to be noted that the arguments brought forward under the head of this issue seem all based on the idea that our object was to stop Wonckhaus trading in oxide altogether which was not the case. Issue (c).—The memorandum of association gave Hassan the authority to conduct sales, but not to grant monopolies—a proceeding opposed to the standing advice of the protecting power and the sheikh’s own principles and interest—much less to alienate to any one a share in the concession itself (in this case to the subject of a foreign Power with which the Trucial sheikhs have no dealings). Issue (d ).—They produce no fresh element. We are agreed that Esa knew of the sales to the Germans. W hat he objected to was the grant of the monopoly which he did not know of, and subsequently to the sale of a share in the company to Brown. Issue (e). The transfer of a share to Brown, and by Brown to Wonckhaus, is simply justified by them as an act of legitimate retaliation or self-defence ; and, on the assump tion that the cancellation was void and illega], it is argued that the transfer was in time and in order. Issue (/).—This issue is adroitly raised in order, if possible, to withdraw the dispute from the sphere of the residency of the Government of India to that of the legation at Tehran. Of course, we are in a much stronger position to lay down what the Sheikh of Shargah can or cannot do as a law unto himself so long as we deal with the matter as within the jurisdiction of the resident in the Persian Gulf. Abu Musa having nothing to do with Persia and the Sheikh of Shargah being under the jurisdiction of the Govern ment of India, and not of His Majesty’s Legation, the argument can no doubt be easily resisted, and should be. February 12, 1910. P. z. cox.Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Further Minute hy Mr. Hurst. ^ THE only material point on which Major Cox disapproves my suggestions for a compromise is the renewal of the term in the contract under which Wonckhaus was to be entitled to the entire output of the mines, other than the small parcels Hassan was to be allowed to send to India. I regard the question whether Hassan s son should be included among the new concessionnaires as a detail. If Major Cox, of his local knowledge, thinks it better to omit him, it would certainly be better to do so ; my only idea was to restore the status quo as nearly as it was safe to do. The monopoly point is rather more difficult. There are two documents with which we have to deal: the concession from the sheikh to Hassam and Co., and the contract from Hassan to Wonckhaus. The former is a document which the sheikh has cancelled and can renew in any terms he pleases ; the latter is a document to which the sheikh is not a party, and the terms of which he has in consequence no means of altering. To get the terms of the contract altered will require the consent of all parties, of the concessionnaires and of W^onckhaus and Co. ; to obtain it will require much more negotiating, and probably also the making of greater concessions to the Germans. Furthermore, the contract between Hassan and Wonckhaus is the portion of the transaction which is mainly commercial, and not political, and with which, therefore, unless there are very strong reasons for the opposite course, I should be disposed not to meddle. It is, of course, quite likely that I am underestimating the importance of the monopoly point, but in my view it is rather misleading to describe the arrangement as a monopoly at all. Even if Messrs. Wonckaus do obtain under the contract the whole of the output of the Abu Musa mines, this will not give them a monopoly of the oxide trade in the Gulf; there are the Ormuz mines in English hands, and these are the only mines at present which have got an established trade. I quite see that the fact that Messrs. Wonckhaus are entitled to the entire output of the mines gives them a position which would enable them to put such pressure on Hassan that they would get him completely into their control, and be able to dominate the mining operations, unless the interests of the sheikh were safeguarded ; but adequate safeguards can, I think, be inserted in the concession which will prevent Messrs. Wonckhaus obtaining any such control. My view, therefore, at present is that to attempt to vary the term in the contract under which Wdnckhaus is entitled to the whole output of the mine would be a m,8take - C. J. B.

CONFIDENTIAL. [30356] [August 22.] Section 2. Sir Edward Grey to Count Metternich. Your Excellency, Foreign Office, August 22, 1910. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 26th ultimo, ' 3 ] relative to the demand of Messrs. Robert Wonckhaus and Co. to be allowed to ship a further consignment of red oxide from Abu Musa. 'I I venture to remind your Excellency that in paragraph 28 of the “ complaint ” of that firm against the Sheikh of Sharga, which was communicated to His Majesty’s Government in Herr von Stumm’s note of the 31st December, 1907, it was implied that the firm had commitments to the extent of at least 2,000 tons of oxide, and that it was to enable them to meet the liability which was thus understood to exist that His Majesty’s Government, in a memorandum dated the 10th January, 1908, consented to the removal from the island of the oxide already mined and ready for shipment. It was equally with this object in view that similar language was employed in the communications of the 4th and 23rd July. That the real intention of His Majesty’s Government was to allow Messrs. Wonck haus, pending the settlement of the dispute, to remove only so much oxide as would enable them to fulfil obligations previously contracted, and not to place them in a position of unfair advantage over British subjects who were not to be permitted to ship any of the mineral at all, is proved by the authoritative statement of the British attitude contained in the memorandum of the 10th July, 1908, which forms^ the reasoned reply to Herr von Stumm’s note above referred to. This statement is as follows : “ They (i.e., His Majesty’s Government) are prepared to use their good offices in order that temporary arrangements may be made whereby Messrs. Wonckhaus will be enabled to procure a limited amount of red oxide to place them in a position to fulfil such contracts as they may have entered into before the cancellation of the lease.” /.That the firm long ago attained their object is proved by a statement made by the German acting consul at Bushire to the British acting consul-general in an official letter dated the 1st March, 1910, to the effect that they had discharged the obligations which they had contracted by means of the oxide shipped on-board the steam-ship “ Louise ” (in April 1908), and by the fact, known to His Majesty’s Govern ment, that so recently as the spring of this year they still had 400 tons of the mineral belonging to that consignment lying unsold at Hamburg. In these circumstances, I cannot but consider that the demand of Messrs. Wonck haus constitutes a clear violation of the spirit of the agreement arrived at by the two Governments, and that the attitude of His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire^ in opposing that demand was not based on a desire to create mere wanton obstruction, but rather on a determination to carry out the intention of His Majesty s Government as expressed in the memorandum of the 10th July, 1908. His Majesty s Government might therefore fairly have claimed to adhere to the terms of that communication as expressing their real intention, and to interpret in the light of it everything which they have elsewhere written on the subject. # In view, however, of the fact that language has been used in notes to you which can be interpreted as an expression of their willingness to allow the removal of all the oxide already mined and lying ready for shipment without reference to the specific requirements of Messrs. Wonckhaus in connection with obligations previously contracted, I have the honour to inform your Excellency that the desired shipment will be permitted, and that Lieutenant-Colonel Cox will be furnished with instructions m this sense. . . „ , , A I venture, however, to express the hope that, in view of the explanations now given, the German Government will abstain from supporting any further requests o this nature which Messrs. Wonckhaus may make. . f I presume that the shipment referred to in the penultimate paragraph oi .&gt;our Excellency’s note as having been the object of obstructive action on the part o± [2853 y-2]Colonel Cox is that which formed the subject of my note to Herr von Kiihlmann of the 2nd May last. In that communication the circumstances which gave rise to the attitude of the consulate-general were fully explained, and I feel confident that, if your Excellency will refer to it once more, you will admit that no fault can justly^, be found with the action of Major Trevor, who was at that time officiating at Bushire in Colonel Cox’s absence.

Department and Sir E.Grey is far from denying The fact however remains that, in three out of four communications The Under Secretary of State, India Office.(28339/10) communications which they have addressed to the German Gov ernment on this subject (albeit not in the most important one) they have used language which can be interpreted as an expression of their willingness to allow the removal of all the oxide already mined and lying ready for ship-* ment without reference to the specific requirements of Messrs. Wonckhaus. It appears to Sir h. Grey that the permission thus given cannot be revoked without laying His Majesty’s Gov ernment open to a charge of bad faith on the part of the German Government, which it would be technically difficult to rebut, though the spirit of the Agreement would not have been violated. He would therefore propose to inform the German .Am bassador, in reply to His Excellency's Note of July 26th, that the desired permission is granted, but he would point out to him at the same time that 1 essrs. Udnckhaus'demand constitutes a clear violation of the spirit of the agree ment arrived at by the two Governments and that the atti tude of His Majesty's Consul General at Bushire in opposing that\ (28339/1G) that demand was not based on a desire to createmere wanton obstruction but rather on a determination to carry out the intention of His Majesty's (government as expressed in their memorandum of July 10th 1908. Sir E. Orey would add that His Majesty's Government might, in the circumstances, fairly have claimed to adhere to the terms of that communication as expressing their real intention and to interpret in the light oi it every thing which they have elsewhere written on this subject. Sir E. Grey does not think that the interests of the Government of India will suffer by allowing this shipment as the liability i which they have indisputably incurred to pay to Messrs. Wonckhaus an indemnity on account of the loss which they have suxiered through the suspension of their mining operations, will thereby be diminished. I am to transmit to you herewith, for Lord Morley's consideration and, as Sir E.

Uu* 2-~ &amp; h&gt; low, I/O 'l With reference to your letter of the 20th ul timo, relative to the desire of Messrs. Robert Wonckhaus and Company to make a further shipment of red oxide from Abu Musa, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith transla tion of a note from the German Ambassador at this Court, complaining of the opposition offered to the request of the firm by His Majesty’s Consul General at Bushire and asking that he may be furnished with instructions to abandon it. Sir E. Grey understands that Lieutenant Colonel Cox’ attitude in this matter is based on the view that, the contracts into which the German firm had entered before the cancellation of the lease having HE C EI V~g» lO s.ui, (admittedly been satisfied by the shipment of April 3 AUG 1910 j INDIA OFFIOE.J190 8 made on board the steamship , 'Louise ,, , His Maj esty's Government are under no obligation to agree Th t '° n e Under Secretary of State, India Office. /'''Nto any further shipments on their hehalf so long as the dispute remains unsettled, since to permit such shipments would he to place Messrs, Wonckhaus in a position of unfair advantage in relation to their British competitors who are precluded from removing any of the mineral from the island at all. Sir E. Grey is far from disputing these facts and he in no way calls in question the logical soundness of the attitude assumed by Colonel Cox, the more so as it appears to be certain that Messrs. Wonckhaus have even been unable to dispose of a por tion of the oxide shipped by them on board the 'Louise' and he considers that the following passage which occurs in the note addressed by him to Count Metternich on July 10th, 1908, can properly be ad- \ duced in support of the contention advanced:- 'They (i.e. His Majesty's Governnent) are prepared to use their good offices in order that temporary arrange ments may be made whereby Messrs. Wonckliaus will be enabled to procure a limited amount of red oxide to ( 27196 / 10 )(2719S/10) / V- '• to place them In a position to lulfil such contracts as they may have entered into before the cancellatio of the lease*' It must not however be forgotten that, on Janu ary 10th of Lhe same year. Sir E. Grey, in a memor andum addressed to the German Charge d*Affaires, wrote 'His Majesty*s Government, however, see no objection to Robert Wonckhaus removing the red oxide which has been already mined and is now ready for shipment from the island.' Again, on July 4th, writing to Count Metternich of the Four hundred tons of oxide remaining on the beach and of the quantity lying near the mine, estimated at about Three thou sand tons of saleable quality, he said: 'These am ounts are at the disposal of Messrs. Wonckhaus.' Finally, on July 23rd, he informed His Excellency that His Majesty's Consul General at Bushire had infonmed the German Consul on June 8th preceding 'that all the red oxide mined might be exported from Abu Musa.'( 27196 / 10 ) I am to state that, in view of these declara tions, Sir E. Grey cannot see his way to support Colonel Cox in his opposition to the proposed ship ment and is disposed, subject to the concurrence of Viscount Morley, to instruct him to allow it to take place without further delay and to inform Count Met- ternich of his action. As regards the other point mentioned by Colonel Cox in his letter to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, copy of which wa enclosed in your communication above referred to, viz. the intervention of Messrs. Wonckhaus and of the German Consulate at Bushire on behalf of the British subject Hassan Samaiye, which is not raised in Count Metternich's note. Sir E. Grey does not propose to allude to the subject in replying to His Excellency. As regards the third sentence in the third paragraph of the Ambassador*s communication, I am to state that Sir E. Grey presumes It to refer to the( 27196 / 10 ) the shipment which formed the subject of correspond ence ending with the Foreign Office letter of May 2n respecting which a full explanation has been furn ished to His Excellency. He v/ould accordingly sug gest that Count Metternich^ attention should be called to the fact and that it should be pointed out to him that the attitude of His Majesty's Consulate General on that occasion was completely justified by the facts of the case. I am to add that, on the 25th ultimo, before his note was written. Count Metternich made a verbal representation to Sir E. Grey on this subject, in the course of which he asked that the matter might be dealt with as quickly as possible in view of the loss to the interests concerned involved in the de lay of the shipment. I am accordingly to request that Sir E. Grey may be favoured with an answer to this letter at as earlyTranslation. Immediate. 271^ . lAvjgjtft) 0^ ^ ^ fiL~J i, J, 'to .

Woenckhaus and Company of Lingaii propose to ship a further 400 to 500 tons of the oxide already ordered (gefflrdert) by them from the Island of Abu Musa Lieutenant Colonel Cox, the British Consul-General at BushIre has however refused to allow the oxide to be snipped aiid ^he efforts of the German Vice-Consul to ob- - a ‘ * a modification of this decision have remained with out effect. In their Memorandum of January 10th 1908 the Brit ish Government gave the assurance that all oxide already ordered by the firm of Woenckhaus could be shipped by them and they confirmed this assurance in their notes of the 4th and 23rd of July, 1908. In April 1908 Messrs. Woenckhaus shipped a large quantity of the oxide lying on the beach on board the Steamship 'Louise', but some 400 tons was still left lying on the shore, while about 3000 tons was lying nearnear near the second mine in the interior of the island In Your Excellency’s note verhale of July 4th 1900 it is expressly mentioned that these two quantitjes would he at Messrs. Woenckhaus' disposal. Althoagn while a request was made for permission to ship 400 to protest had been made by the German Government. a.ere can therefore be no doubt that the firm has the righu* in view of the existing agreements with the British Government, to dispose of the oxide which is s^ill lying there and which must amount to more than 3000 tons. I am therefore instructed to make a protest agains Lieutenant Colonel Cox*© action in again raising diffi culties in regard to this matter and in failing to ob serve the earlier engagements entered into by the | the firm have repeatedly intended to make further j shipments only one has so far been undertaken in the spring of this year, to the extent of about 300 tons In this case also the British Resident raised difficulties, which were only overcome after a BritishII British Governnient. The German Government feel assur ed that the British Government will without delay ad dress the necessary instructions to their Representative at Bushire in order that he may abandon his opposition to the proposed shipment and that he may in future act in accordance with the assurances given by his Govern ment in regard to this matter.

I AM directed by Secretar}^ Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, enquiring whether, in view of the fact that a shipment of red oxide from the island of Abu Musa has been permitted on behalf of Hajji Ali-bin- Hassan Samaize, your firm are at liberty to enter into negotiations with the object of arranging shipments of that mineral to the United Kingdom. I am to inform you in reply that, by the agreement concluded by His Majesty’s Government with the German Government for the temporary regulation of the question of the working of the oxide mines on Abu Musa, pending the final settlement of the dispute which has arisen on the subject, all shipments of the mineral are forbidden except to Messrs. Wonckhaus, who are allowed to remove a limited quantity to enable them to fulfil commercial engagements previously contracted. Permission was given for the small shipment, referred to in your letter, under the impression that it was to take place on behalf of that firm, but when it was discovered that this impression was erroneous it was thought better not to withdraw the authorization already accorded, even though it was the result of a misunderstanding, and the work was therefore allowed to proceed. No further shipments of the kind will, however, be permitted, and, indeed, His Majesty’s Government are precluded by the arrangement referred to above from authorising the removal of oxide by anybody but Messrs.

Secondly, 1 called at Lingah to call upon Mr. New, and incidentally saw Hasan and Abdullah. They told me it was of no importance to them for Abdullah to have access to island, and that it was not they but the Germans wbo had pressed it. 1 informed them that when we had concurred in the abandoned shipment, it was on the understanding that, as before, it was to fulfil Wonckhaus’ contract and not for the benefit of Hasan, but that concurrence having been accorded 1 was loth to go back on it, and that if they could satisfy me in the matter of Abdullah’s access to the island 1 was prepared, in anticipation of the concurrence of Sheikh Shargah and Government, to agree to allow him as a favour to ship this particular consignment without pressing the question as to whom it was for. They gave me a satisfactory undertaking .regarding extent of Abdullah’s access to the island, and 1 authorised Hasan, subject to confirmation, to ship by next convenient steamer.

(2) Letter No. 550, dated 26th February 1910, to German Vice-Consul. copies of two letters which I on the subject. shipment of oxide from Abu Musa, I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, Vice-Consul have a ddressed to the Acting German 2. As already reported by telegram, I intended to call as soon as possible after Monsieur Wassmuss’ return from a short shooting trip, to communicate to him the views of His Majesty’s Government on the subject of Messrs. Wonckhaus’s proposal to send their own coolies, as set forth in Foreign Department telegram No. S.-101, dated 21st February 1910. On Friday morning last I received a telegram from Henjam from the Residency Agent, Lingah (a copy of w hich I annex), informing me that Hassan bin Samaiyeh had informed him that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. intend to send coolies to Abu Musa within four days to arrange a shipment by Bombay-Persian S.S. Naseri. I thereupon called on Mr. Wassmuss and explained the views of His Majesty’s Government to him, and asked him about the proposed shipment by the S.S. Naseri. I have informed the Government of India by telegram (No. 182, dated 25th February) of the result of this interview. In accordance with Mr. Wassmuss’ request I have sent him a semi-official letter giving him the gist of the views of His Majesty’s Government. 3. It appears to me that the fact that the shipment is to he made by J Hassan bin Samaiyeh completely alters the position. So far as I am aware we have only agreed to allow Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. to ship oxide to fulfil their alleged forward contracts. It appears to me that as, from our point of view, the concession has been cancelled, there is no more reason that Hassan bin Samaiyeh should ship oxide than that Isa bin Abdul Latif, Messrs. A. and T. J. Malcolm or any other of the partners should do so. I have therefore ventured to suggest that this shipment should not he allowed at all. 4. Mr. Wassmuss informed me that he had “ all along said that the ship ment w T as to he made by Messrs. Wonckhaus on behalf of the “ Compagnie mini&amp;re” (or words to this effect), and now 1 see that his letter of August the 19th, 1909, is compatible with this. But when this letter was received I did not understand—and I do not think Colonel Cox did either—that Mr. Wassmuss intended to inform us that Messrs. M onckhaus intended to effect a shipment on behalf of Hassan Samaiyeh under the terms of their contract with him which allowed some 400 tons annually to be shipped to India by Hassan. I think Colonel Cox thought, as I did, that Mr. Wassmuss only indulged in the expression “ Compagnie mini&amp;re ’ to show that ho considered that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. had a share in the concern and that the shipment was actually intended for Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. 5. As the shipment is to be made by Hassan, the proposal that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. should send coolies is quite absurd. There is no reason of course why Hassan should not ship himself as before. Mr. vv assmuss informed me that should Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. send coolies they would be sent in charge of Hassan’s brother Hamud thus pro\ mg my conten tion that the presence of Abdulla bin Hassan is by no means necessary, that Hamud bin Ali can do the work efficiently. I have senC a telegram (a copy of which is annexed) to the Residency Agent, Lingah, informing him that I cannot agree to^ Messis. onck laus &amp; Co. sending coolies; should they do so I presume it 'w ill be necessary to j send a ship to Abu Musa and remove them.teMgraphier ^ mon Gouvemement pour m’informer si les m6mes facilites qu’on ayait arrangees pour Messieurs Wonckhaus et Cie. tiennent bonnes pour Hassan bin Samaiyeh. r Yeuillez done enjoindre a Messieurs Wonckhaus et Cie. s’ils ont 1’intention d envoyer des coulies, de s’abstenir de cette demarche.

From—The Residency Agent, Lingah (HenjamJ, To—The Political Resident, Bushire. Hassan Samaiyeh informed me that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. intend sending coolies within next four days to Abu Musa to ship oxide per steamer Naseri on return from Basrah. I notified Hassan Samaiyeh that he must not send coolies before receipt of your permission; to this he replied that Messrs. Wonckhaus stated that they would act in accordance with the German Consul’s instructions. Kindly wire me instructions what to do in event of their despatching coolies to Abu Musa to ship oxide. Telegram, dated the 25th February 1910. From— Major A. P. Trevor, I.A., First Assistant Resident, Bushire, To—The Residency Agent, Lingah (Henjam). No. 180. Your wire of to-day. I have received no notification from the German Consulate that the Naseri is to take oxide, and German Consul states he has not heard anything either. You should inform Hassan that I cannot agree to Messrs. Wonckhaus sending coolies to the Island, firstly, because the British Government has not agreed to change the existing procedure by which Hassan arranges shipments himself, and, secondly, because no notification of intended shipment has been given me by German Consul according to arrangement. You should tell Hassan to inform Wonckhaus of this and also inform them verbally yourself, adding that if they send coolies they will do so at their ow n risk and that it may be necessary to prevent them going. Could local arrangements be made to prevent coolies ? You can tell Hassan that if he accepts conditions and asks to be allowed to send coolies in charge of Hamud, I will recommend that second of the above objections be waived. I hear the shipment is not for Wonckhaus but for Hassan, and that if Wonckhaus send coolies they propose to send Hamud in charge. I am enquiring if Naseri has been chartered.(1) Semi-official note Irom Herr WassmuM, to Major Trevor, dated 27th Febrnray 1910.

From Major A. P. Trevor, First Assistant Resident, in charge of Residency, To—The Secretary to the Government, of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of the correspondence ending with my telegram No. 205 dated 4th March 1910, I have the honour to forward herewith, for the informa tion of the Government of India, copies of the marginally cited correspondence on the subject of the proposed shipment of 400 tons of oxide from Abu Musa. 2. The S. S. Nasei'i arrived here from Basrah on the morning of the 2nd instant, and in anticipation of the sanction of Government, I wrote to the Master requesting him not to go to Abu Musa as Hassan bin Samaiyeh had not received permission of Government to make the ,, , , shipment. The master replied that he wonid comply with my request, and the ship left for Bahrein on the afternoon of the 2nd March. I venture to call attention to the point that Hassan bin Samaiyeh informed the Captain of the Naseri that he would require his ship to go to Abu Musa when the Naseri was at Lingah on the 17th February It would have been easy for Hassan to have informed Khan Bahadur Agha Bedrof the proposed shipment in time for him to communi cate with me by the Naseri, which arrived here on her upward voyage on the 22nd February; similarly Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. could have communi cated with their Consul by the same ship. But neither Hassan nor Messrs. Wonckhaus made any communication. Mr. Wassmuss alludes to this in the fourth paragraph of his letter J. No. 97, but passes the matter by lightly. In view of the frequent assurances that we should receive warning of the date of the steamer s arrival, and of the fact that on this occasion a change of procedure i.e., coolies being sent by Messrs. Wonckhaus instead of by Hassan, was con templated, the failure of either Hassan or Messrs. Wonckhaus to give intima tion of the proposed visit of the Naseri until three days before she is due at Lingah must, I think, be regarded as an intentional lapse on their part. 3. As the Sheikh of Shargah has never agreed to Hassan making ship ments, and as in view of the fact that the cancellation of the concession was due to Hassan’s fraudulent behaviour, it seemed to me that the Sheikh mi'ht very well object to Hassan making shipments. Further, it had become a matter of talk in Lingah that this shipment was for Hassan, and anybody going over to Shargah might bring this fact to the notice of the Sheikh. I therefore thought it might be advisable with a view to preventing all chance 1 of a fracas on the island, to remove any coolies who might have gone there. With this object in view I sent my wire No. 191 of 1st March to the Com- mander-in-Chief, but submitted a copy to the Foreign Department in case the Government of India might not approve of my suggestion. Foreign Depart ment Telegram S. 133 was received by me on the 3rd March in time for the Senior Naval Officer to stop any vessel going to Abu Musa without instruc tions from His Majesty’s Government. The Commander of H. M. S. ! Philomel, who called at Lingah on his way to Bushire on the 3rd instant, I was able to inform me that no coolies had left, so that as it turned out it 1 would not have been necessary to send a ship to Abu Musa in any case. I attribute the sudden activity of Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Cp. at Lingah and of Hassan bin Samaiyeh to the influence of Mr. Brown, who returned from leave by the S. S. Sparta and arrived at Lingah on the 11th February ; further, I am inclined to think that if Mr. Brown had remained at Lingah instead of going on to Bahrein on the 24th February, Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. would have sent the coolies to Abu Musa. 4. I beg to irivite a reference to Mr. Wassmuss’s letter J. No. V7, and to my letter No. ^ 582 with regard to the question of this particular ship ment, which, it now appears, is for Hassan bin Samaiyeh. In his letter2 Mr. Wassmuss states that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. had fulfilled their forward contracts by the shipment by the Louise. I am not aware of the exact terms in which His Majesty’s Government granted permission to Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. to ship the oxide already mined and piled up, but to the best of my belief the permission was given with a view to prevent Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. incurring great loss through failure to com ply with forward contracts. As they fulfilled these contracts by a shipment nearly two years ago, and indeed have not since attempted to get any more oxide for themselves at all, it af)pears to me that from a commercial point of view Ihey have no more (if as much) right to the oxide already mined than have the original partners in the concession. I may add that I am credibly informed by Messrs. Strick &amp; Co's, agent that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. have still 400 tons of the oxide shipped by the S. S. Louise in April 1908 lying on their hands at Hamburg unsold. 5. Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co’s, present tactics seem to be to keep their footing on the island by acting as agents for Hassam bin Samaiyeh and shipping oxide on his behalf, as they do not want any themselves. It seems to me a very topsy-turvey state of affairs that Mr. Wassmuss should seriously ask us to allow Messrs. Wonchkhaus &amp; Co. to send coolies and act on behalf of Hassan. The more so when it is remembered that the alleged reason for Hassan’s inability to make the shipment on behalf of Messrs. Wpnckhaus &amp; Co. was that his son Abdullah’s presence was considered indispen sable, whereas when Messrs. Wonckhaus propose to send coolies to make a shipment for Hassan, they propose to send coolies in charge of Hassan’s brother Hamad. This individual has always done the greater portion of the superin tending work and was in charge of the work in October 1907, when the coolies were removed from the island. 6. i\s Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. fulfilled their forward contracts nearly two years ago and apparently do not desire any more oxide for themselves, it seems to me that the permission to remove oxide from the island should he withdrawn from all alike until the case is settled ; and Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. should be called upon to reduce their claim to a cash basis and file a suit against Hassan bin Samaiyeh or, if they prefer, against Hassan and the Sheikh as co-defendant. Arrangements could then be made through Messrs. Malcolm &amp; Co. or in some other manner to sell the mined oxide in the best market, and place the sum realised in deposit against any damages which might he awarded to Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. 7. In view of the fact that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. have not sugges ted a shipment for nearly two years (out of the four years for which their original contract with Hassan bin Samaiyeh was to last) and of the fact that in two years’ time (notwithstanding the alleged forward contracts) they have not been able to dispose of the whole of the 1,800 tons or so shipped by the S.S. Louise, I would not think the damages could be placed at a very high figure, unless they are claimed on “ moral or intellectual” grounds. 8. It would appear to me undesirable that Hassan should he allowed to ship oxide unless we intend subsequently to claim that Malcolm (or any of the other share-holders of the original concession) have an equal right to ship. In any case, I think that the suggestion that Messrs. Wonckhaus have the right to allow Hassan (or any one else) to ship mined oxide, should be resisted, and that Messrs. W onckhaus &amp; Co. should he informed that we can neither accept their claim to act on behalf of Hassan nor permit them to send their own coolies to the island to make a shipment either on their own or Hassan’s behalf.

Herr von Kuhlmann stated that he had received in structions to ask His Majesty's Government to direct Major Trevor not to interfere with the shipment which would take place in accordance with previous agreement.

Dear Mr. Mullet:- The follov/ing 1 b an extract of a letter I wrote to Colonel Cox a few days ago with reference to the difficulty which the Germans are experiencing in s^llldg the parcel of Abu Musa Oxide which they Import- ed into Hamburg about two years ago. 'So far as I have been able to gather, after 'a lapse of two years, there is still a stock of 'some 700 tons now lying at Hamburg which Messrs. 'Trauen Sturken and Company the Agents for Messrs.

They are now offering this stock at s v 'about 48/- F.O.B. Hamburg without finding 'buyers.' What I then wrote has since been confirmed by the fact that Messrs.

I am directed by Secretary sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo relative to the shipment by Messrs. Wonckhaus of the red oxide which has been already mined on the island of Abu Musa. I am to state that Sir E. Grey concurs in the opinion of Viscount Morley that the conditions at- tached last year to the presence in the island of Kassan bin Samaiye are reasonable and should be up- held ( and that it is undesirable that the German firm should be permitted to send their own coolies to the spot. Sir E. Grey would accordingly suggest that in structions should be sent to the Acting British Consul General at Bushire to inform the German Vice-Consul in in e Unde r r Secretary of State, India Office.(2118/10). in. a friendly manner that His Majesty^ Government cannot understand the reasons for raising at this t lace hour me question of the arrangements made with a view to facilitate the shipment of the oxide on behalf of Messrs. Wonckhaus inasmuch as, sc far as Sir E. Grey has been informed, they were not called in question in 1908 and have in no respect been changed. His Majesty* s Government would however be glad to know in what respect they are irksome^ but in the meantime, in view of their responsibility for the maintenance of order on the island, they regret that they are unable to modify them.

I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department telegram No. S:-439, dated the 18th November 1909, on the subject of a shipment of oxide from Abu Musa by Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. 2. I now beg to forward, for the inform ation of the Government of India, copies of correspondence which has taken place between the Acting German Yice- Consul and myself on the subject since I addressed my letter No. 2318, dated the 12th September, to you. 3. Herr Wassmuss intimated to the Resident as far back as the 9th August last that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. proposed to remove some 4 to 500 tons of oxide. So far nothing has been done, and as will be seen from the correspondence the actual shipment has been put off from month to month. In fact Messrs. Wonckhaus, while putting forward various excuses for not having arranged for a steamer, have not actually made any serious attempt to secure one. • Herr Wassmuss now in his last letter, forwarded herewith, attempts to attribute the delay to the conditions which have been imposed by the Resident on Hassan bin Samaiyeh. As I have already had the honour of in forming Government in my letter No^2318, dated the 12th September last, the only point on which there is any difference is regarding the right of Abdulla bin Hassan Samaiyeh to go to the island. In my opinion there is absolutely no reason why this individual should go to the island with the coolies, and as I have already stated in the abovementioned letter, there are many reasons why he should not do so. 4. The correspondence and the disingenuous attitude adopted by Messrs. Wonckhaus prove, I think, that this desire to ship 400 tons of oxide is not a genuine one and that it has been expressed, as suggested by Major Cox in paragraph 3 of his letter No. 2086, dated the 22nd August, solely with a view to keeping alive their active interest in the island. 5. If it has been agreed between His Majesty’s Government and the German Government to “ sterilize ” the island I venture to suggest that I may be authorised to inform the German Yice-Consul that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. should effect this shipment of 400 tons of oxide before a certain date, after which, in accordance with the agreement between our respective Governments, no further shipments of oxide by any one will be permitted until the whole question has been settled. As Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. have already been trifling with the matter for four months, it would not, in my opinion, be neces sary to give them a long period of grace, and the final date for the removal of the oxide might be fixed, if Government see no objection, at one month after the date of my letter intimating it. 7^7 4' 4 Kaiserlich Deutsches Yizekonsulat.

The German Consul now proposes, in answer to my letter enclosed in above, that in order to settle difference of opinion as to whether Abdulla-bin-Hasan should go to Abu Musa Island or not. Wonokhaus and Company’s suggestion that they should undertake shipment of 400 tons with their own coolies, should be accepted. I do not think that we have so far recognised that Wonckhaus and Company have any direct interest in Island but only a contract with Hasan to receive from him oxide free on board. On the other hand we have agreed to allow Oxide now mined to be exported by Wonckhaus and Company.

This reply, which has been very carefully and thoroughly prepared and contains a good deal of new evidence collected on the spot, is forwarded in a note expressing the opinion of the German Government that, if Kis Majesty's Government should decline to admit the grounds on which the German contention is based but The Under Secretary of State, India Office.(294/10). 7 frut should adhere to the view which they have hither to held, the point at issue should he referred to the Permanent Tribunal at The Hague.

[January 3, 1910.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. '%94] No. 1 Count Metternich to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received January 3, 1910.) (Translation.) Your Excellency, German Embassy, December 4, 1909. UNDER instructions from my Government, I have the honour to transmit herewith six copies of a second memorandum drawn up by the German Government on the subject of the Abu Musa incident, in reply to the Memorandum of the British Government. The Memorandum sets forth the general and legal position as estabiished by facts and proofs. It comes to the conclusion that the action of the Sheikh of Shargeh against the mining company, Hassan-ibn-Ali and Co., was illegal, that in its ultimate aim it was directed against the contract between Herr Robert Wonckhaus and the mining company, and that the forcible measures taken by the sheikh were directly promoted by the agents (“ Organen ”) of the British Government. According to the ordinary principles of law, therefore, the British Government and the sheikh are jointly responsible for the consequences of these actions. On the one hand, Herr Robert Wonckhaus should be compensated for the damage which he sustained through the non-lulfilment of the contract consequent upon the infringement of the rights of the mining company by the sheikh, supported by the agents of the British Government. On the other hand, the firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Co. should be compensated, as a participant in the mining company, for their share of the damage sustained by the mining company through the suspension of operations. A detailed calculation of the damage is reserved. In order to obviate an increase of the damage and to put an end to the existing disturbance to property, the mining company should be permitted with the greatest promptitude to continue their mining operations. Having regard to the present position of affairs, the German Government believe that they should first of all only apply to the British Government to take steps for the removal of the disturbance to property and for the granting of compensation for damage sustained. If, contrary to expectation, the British Government should not admit the grounds on which the attitude of the German Government is based, as set forth in the Memo randum, and should adhere to the negative view which they have hitherto adopted, the Second Memorandum by the German Government respecting the Abu Musa Incident. November 1909. IN consequence of what is stated in the Memorandum of His Majesty’s Govern ment of the 10th July, 1908, the Imperial German Government have again examined the complaint of the German firm, Robert Wonckhaus and Co., of Lingah, in regard to the occurrences on the island of Abu Musa. In this examination they have given every consideration to the arguments used in the Memorandum, and to the documents communicated to them. From a comparison of the British Memorandum with the first German Memorandum (of December 1907), it appears that the following facts are not disputed Till the spring of 1883 Sheikh Salim-ibn-Sultan-ibn-Sakar Alkasimi (referred to below for short as Sheikh Salim or Salim), was reigning Sheikh of Shargeh, to the territory of which the island of Abu Musa belongs. During the time that he was in German Government are* of opinion that the point at issue should be referred to the Permanent Tribunal at The Hague. I have, &amp;c. P. METTERNICH. Enclosure in No. 1. [2574 c—1] B2 the Island of Abu Musa, in which he always took a particular interest, and where he had built himself a dwelling-house and had established date plantations, he was deposed by his nephew, the present reigning Sheikh Sakar-ibn-Khalid (called below for short, Sheikh Sakar or Sakar). Sheikh Sakar at that time intended to drive Sheikh Salim out of Abu Musa by force, but was prevented from doing so by the British resident in the Persian Gull. Nevertheless Salim left Abu Musa and went to Lingah, until, July 1883 an agreement was made between the two sheikhs, according to which Sheikh Sakar was to pay to Sheikh Salim an annual pension of 600 dollars. There upon Salim returned to Abu Musa. In 1884, however, differences again arose between the two in consequence of political intrigues of Salim against Sakar, and Sakar several times complained to the British resident in letters. As Salim was in financial straits he was obliged to give in, and a second agreement was arrived at. Under this agreement Sakar, for whose means the pension of 600 dollars previously settled was too high, granted his uncle a pension of 400 dollars annually, half to be paid in money and half in kind. The revenue from the Island of Sir Abu Nuair, said to amount to 200 dollars, was also assigned to Salim. After this the relations of the two sheikhs remained peaceful until the spring of 1889, when, as is alleged, Salim was making prepara tions for an attack on Shargeh. The British agent at Shargeh, however, succeeded in reconciling the two sheikhs, and persuaded them to conclude a new agreement (6th April, 1889). By this Sakar undertook to continue the payment of the pension of 400 dollars, allowed Salim to live at Shargeh within certain bounds, and promised to treat him in other respects also in accordance with his rank. The Island of Sir, v 7 hich produced no revenue, was not mentioned in this agreement. Salim undertook to keep the peace and to obey his nephew. The two sheikhs afterwards lived on good terms, so that Sheikh Salar, when absent from his capital, entrusted the government to his uncle. (Annexes Nos. 2 to 6 of the British Memorandum.) By a document dated the 10th April, 1898 (18 Dulkade, 1315), Sheikh Salim leased the red oxide mines on the Island of Abu Musa for an annual rent of 250 French reals, to the British ^ subjects, Alhaj Hassan-ibn-Ali Samaih (called below 7 Hassan Samaih, for short), his son Abdallah-ibn-Hassan (Abdallah, for short), and Isa-ibn- Abdallatif (Isa, for short), son of the British consular agent at Shargeh, Abdallatif-ibn- Abdarrahman, who represented his son in all business of the company of lessees. At that time Sheikh Salim was Regent of Shargeh, as Sheikh Sakar w^as absent on a pilgrimage to Mecca. The rent was paid regularly, and received by Sheikh Salim. On the 19th August, 1898 (l Rebi-el-Tani, 1316), Sheikh Sakar w’as received into the company of lessees as a shareholder on an equal footing with the others. He, however, on the 29th January, 1899, (17 Ramadan, 1316), made his share over to one Yussuf-bin-Abdallah, who transferred it to Hassan Samaih. This share was, on the 10th October, 1907, sold by Hassan Samaih to Thomas Browm, a British subject, from whom it was purchased by the firm of Robert Wdnckhauj^ and Co., of Lingah, on the 16th October, 1907. (Annexes 3 to 4 E of the first German Memorandum.) Previously to this, on the 1st June, 1906, a contract (Annex 5 of the first German Memorandum and Annex 10 of the British Memorandum) had been concluded between Hassan Samaih and the German merchant Robert Wonckhaus, a partner in the firm of Wonckhaus and Co., under which from 2,000 to 5,000 tons of red oxide were to be delivered to Wonckhaus annually for four years from the mines on Abu Musa. The company had also contracted with another party to deliver 400 tons a-year for five years to India. (Annex 19 of the first German Memorandum.) On the 21st February, 1907 (9th Moharrem, 1325), Sheikh Sakar addressed a letter (Annex 12 of the first German Memorandum) to Hassan Samaih, in which he demanded that the working of the red oxide mines on Abu Musa should cease. The ostensible ground for this step is a complaint made by Isa to the sheikh that the contract for delivery of red oxide had been made with Wonckhaus without his sanction. There upon a somew hat lengthy correspondence ensued between Hassan Samaih on the one side and Sheikh Sakar, Sheikh Salim, and the British consular authorities on the other (Annexes 13 to 16, 18 to 20 of the first German Memorandum) until Sheikh Sakar, in two letters of the 3rd October, 1907 (25 Shaban, 1325), one of which was to be handed to Hassan Samaih, and his receipt obtained, in the presence of the British consular agent at Lingah, again ordered that the work should cease. (Annexes 21 and 22 of the first German Memorandum.) Thereupon, about the 20th October, 190/, Sheikh Sakar sent armed men to the island, who compelled the miners to leave and forcibly prevented further work at the mines. * * Annexes 1 to 5.3 The boats containing the sheikh’s armed force were towed to Abu Musa by the British war-ship “ Lapwing,” on board which was Lieutenant C. H. Gabriel, British vice-consul at Bunder Abbas. About mid-day on the 23rd October (a few hours after the departure of the British ^war-ship) two employes of the firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Co , who had approached ^he island in order to land on it, were received with bullets by the sheikh’s armed men, and forced to turn hack. The facts being as stated above, there is a difference of opinion as to whether Sheikh Sakar was justified in acting as he did. Whereas the British Memorandum maintains that there was nothing illegal in Sheikh Sakar’s proceedings, the Imperial Government are still of opinion that he had no legal right, either by private or by public law, to cancel of his own motion the lease agreement concluded by Sheikh Salim, and that the forcible execution of his decision must undoubtedly be regarded as an illegal act. (A-)-—Position of Sheikh Sakar with respect to the Company of Lessees, FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF PRIVATE LAW. It is stated in the British Memorandum that the Island of Abu Musa is the property of Sheikh Sakar, and that it was only as the representative of Sakar and while he acted as regent during the latter’s pilgrimage, that Sheikh Salim concluded the lease agreement; that the island is an integral part of the dominions of the Sheikh ofShargeh, who in recent years has regularly sent his cattle to graze on the island; and that Sheikh Sakar, who after the deposition of Salim made the latter an allowance, had, solely in consequence of oral and personal arrangements, increased this allowance by the revenue of Abu Musa, including that derived from the red oxide mines. In proof of this the British Memorandum first cites a letter from Salim to Sakar of the 21st February, 1908 (Annex 1 of British Memorandum), in which Salim declares that he has no claim to the island and has never put forward any claim to it, and then a kind of Memorandum of Sheikh Sakar, dafed the 22nd February, 1898 # (Annex 5 of British Memorandum), in which he gives an account of his relations with Salim and his arrangements with him in regard to property. Further, there are cited two letters from Sakar to the British resident in the Persian Gulf, dated the 21st January and 14th February, 1884 (Annexes 3, 4 of the British Memorandum), in which Sakar describes Abu Musa as “our island and a dependency of Shargah,” as well as the agreement between the two sheikhs, of the 6th April, 1889) Annex 2 of the British Memorandum). Finally, reference is made to a Memorandum of Major P. Z. Cox, British resident in the Persian Gulf, dated the 28th February, 1.908, on the history of Abu Musa (Annex 6 of the British Memorandum), and to a letter from Sakar to the British resident, Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball, dated the llth October, 1902 (Annex 7 of British Memorandum), which is held to show that in concluding the lease agreement, Salim was acting in his capacity of regent. Before these arguments are examined, attention must be called to an inaccuracy in the text of the British Memorandum. It is there stated that Sakar granted to Salim the revenue of the island, including that derived from the mines. Sakar in his own account only speaks of having assigned to Salim the amount of the rent of the oxide mines, in consequence of his complaint that his income was insufficient. As regards the evidence produced, the Imperial Government regret that they are unable to accept as unobjectionable testimony the letter of Sheikh Salim to Sheikh Sakar, dated the 21st February, 1908, to which the first place is assigned in the British Memorandum. This letter and Sakar’s Memorandum of the 22nd February, 1908, which must be regarded simply as the version of an interested party and valueless as evidence, were written at a time when efforts were being made to collect proofs of the legality of the steps taken by Sakar against the company of lessees. The Imperial Government have information that Major Cox was at Shargeli just at that time. The contents of both documents are so much out of harmony with the former attitude of the two sheikhs and with facts which will be mentioned further on, that one can only conclude that the sheikhs at the later period gave a different account of the proprietary rights on Abu Musa. Sakar’s letters to the British resident in 1884 (Annexes 3, 4 of the British Memorandum) are no evidence of Sakar’s ownership of the island. In order to under stand them fully, one must remember that they were written at a time when Salim was living at Abu Musa after being deposed by Sakar, when the two sheikhs were enemies, and when Sakar still had to fear resistance on the part of the former ruler, and peihaps * Sic [? 1908].4 even the seizure and retention of part of his dominions by him. But Sakar, having undertaken the government of Shargeh, was responsible for the preservation of peace in accordance with the Maritime Truce, as is explained in the Memorandum by Major Cox referred to above. He therefore begged the British resident to warn Salim to keep quiet, and in order to justify his request laid stress on the fact that Abu Musa was politically a dependency of Shargeh. The sole object of the letters therefore wa &amp;p*^ to put an end to the political conflict between the two sheikhs. This view is supporter* ' by the following minute (printed in Annex 6 of the British Memorandum), which appears with Sakar s second letter, in the archives of the British resident:— “ Sheikh Sagar seems to insist that if Salim continues to live on Bu Musa he should give a guarantee through the resident that he will not do anything to disturb him, Sheikh Sagar, or the maritime peace.” So that when we find in the one letter the words : “ Abu Musa is an island dependent on Shargah, and we cannot spare it to others,” and in the other the words: “ Bu Musa is our island and a dependency of Shargah,” this can only refer, according to the whole context, to the circumstance that the island belongs politically to the territory of Shargah. Consistently with this, Salim himself, as mentioned below (p. 6), describes Abu Musa in several letters and documents as “my” or “our” island (meaning, that is, that he is the private owner), and as “ a dependency of Shargah.” If Sheikh Sakar goes on to write : “ I cannot dispense with the Island of Bu Musa, as it is of great use to me,” this can only be taken, in view of the context just referred to, in a political sense and not in the sense of private ownership. In the British Memorandum these letters are made use of to support the assertion that Salim’s presence on Abu Musa was only “tolerated.” The contention is evidently that Salim had no right whatever to live on Abu Musa, and that if he did live there, it was really only owing to the kindness of Sakar. But it appears from what has been said above that this “toleration” is to be understood entirely in a political sense and has nothing to do with the question of private ownership. No doubt Sheikh Sakar was at liberty to banish his political opponent from the country and also to prevent him from residing on his private estate. If Sakar did not do this, that is no reason for concluding that Salim had no right, from the point of view of private law, to reside at Abu Musa. Salim’s right to live at Abu Musa on the strength of his owning private property there, and Sakar’s decision to tolerate his presence there, in spite of political hostility, are such very different things that conclusions cannot possibly be drawn from one to the other. Those letters, then, have nothing to do with the question of private ownership. In any case, they cannot be cited to disprove the private ownership of Salim. If, however, they are to be considered as having a bearing on this question, they would seem rather to point to the conclusion that Sakar regarded Abu Musa as a domain of Salim, from which he would have to drive him if Salim was guilty of political misconduct by interfering in Sakar’s affairs or disturbing the peace. (“ If Salim wants to live in it and guarantees that he will not commit anything which would interfere with my affairs or disturb the maritime peace, it matters not . . . .”) The letter, too, which Sakar addressed to Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball on the 11th October, 1902 (Annex 7 of the British Memorandum), seems, on closer examination, to have a 'very different meaning from that assigned to it in the British Memorandum. In order to understand the letter, it would be interesting to know the purport of Kemball s inquiry, to which Sakar’s letter was an answer and which is not printed in the Memorandum. Other known facts, however, make it possible to form an idea of what led to the letter being written and enable one to arrive at a proper appreciation of its contents. On p. 9 of the “ Administration Beport on the Persian Gulf Residency and Muscat Political Agency for 1898-9,” the following passage occurs It is repoited that the uncle of the Sheikh of Shargah has given a long lease of some oxide mines to Haji Ali Hubash, also known as Nukhoda Ah, who is a resident oi Busline, where he got into trouble and had to leave. He is said to have already exported 400 tons of oxide, and a further enquiry into the concession will be made when an opportunity offers.” It is^ not stated vvhere these mines are situated, but, in any case, Lieutenant- Colonel Kemball certainly seems to have considered the sheikh’s uncle, i.e., Salim, as the o\\ nei of the mines m question, as otherwise the above passage, which says nothing about a regency or representation, would have left open the question how Salim came to give the lease. It is to be presumed that later on the resident, carrying out his5 intention of making further enquiries, asked Sakar for information about this lease of 7902 Zf' 7 rUm ° U fi ^ reached , ^ Sakar then re P lied &gt; on the 1 October, f * la t no agreement had been made between him and Nakhoda Ali about the Island 01 bir, with which the present investigation is not concerned. He continues “ With regard to Abu Musa, my uncle. Sheikh Salim-bin-Sultan cultivates in that ^~ a nd&gt; and m the year m which I went on the Hajj my aforesaid uncle was acting as y regent in Shargah and he saw fit to lease the mines of Abu Musa to Hassan-bin- Samayieh, a British subject, and Abdallah-bin-Hassan and Esa-bin-Abdul Latif, and the lease has remained up to now.” It cannot be inferred from this letter that Salim was acting only as regent On the contrary, the words, “ With regard to Abu Musa, my uncle .... cultivates in that island, contain a recognition that Sakar has really nothing to do with the cultivation of Abu Musa, but that Salim cultivates it, and presumably has a right to do so ® Salim s regency is mentioned, firstly, in order to fix the time, and, secondly, with a view to throwing on Salim the political responsibility as well for the lease in question : ior the inquiries of the British resident were evidently inconvenient to Sakar. This ls f sm P llsln g when it is realised that the sheikh evidently has a wrong conception m u s ^P® of ^ ri treat y excluded with the British Indian Government on the 7th arch, 189 When asked by the dragoman of the Imperial vice-consulate at Buslure on the 28th November, 1907, “What harm is there in having made a contract with the German firm ? Sheikh Sakar replied, “ We have made treaties with the Bug ish which prevent us from leasing .any ^ part of our territory to foreigners other than British subjects.^ I his interpretation is evidently erroneous, as it gives to the treaty a meaning which would be incompatible with the principle of the open door. I his conception of the treaty explains why Sakar, when Lieutenant-Colonel Kembali asked him about leases of land in which a foreigner—the Persian, Nakhoda Ali—was concerned, hastened to assure him that he had had no dealings with Nakhoda Ali, and to explain that his uncle during his regency, and not he, had concluded a lease agree ment, and that only with British subjects, so that, if the lease had been a violation of the ready of 1892, the political responsibility would have fallen primarily on Salim and not on Sakar. Ihe letter to Lieutenant-Colonel Kembali—which is, moreover, the only document produced in this connection supplies no evidence that Salim was acting simply as regent when he concluded trie lease agreement. On the other hand it is an important indicatio n of the manner in which Sakar at that time regarded the position of Salim with respect to Abu Musa. Further, if Sakar now asserts (Annex 5 of British Memorandum) that he volun tarily assigned the rent of 250 Irench reals to Salim, m order to raise his income to the amount previously promised or to a little over that amount, that is an ex parte state ment for which there is no proof, and which is inconsistent with facts that will be considered below (pp. 6 et seq.). The circumstance that Sakar used to send his cattle to pasture on Abu Musa would not be inconsistent with Salim’s ownership of the island, for, as may be gathered from Major Cox’s account (Annex 6 of British Memorandum), this may very well be a privilege of the reigning Sheikh of Shargeh, a kind of servitude to which the private property in the island is subject. In this connection mention may be made of another circumstance which has an important bearing on the question of the ownership of Abu Musa. As stated above the arrangement of 1889 was preceded by other agreements respecting the pecuniary compensation to Salim, and in order to increase his pension, which had been reduced to 400 dollars, the revenue of the Island of Sir Abu Nuair, estimated at 200 debars, was assigned to him. Now if the revenue of an island was to be given to Salim would it not have been natural to give him that of the Island of Abu Musa, which he could have checked, and, if necessary, collected himself, since he resided in the island ? Of course, if Abu Musa was already Salim’s property this expedient could not be adopted. The objections raised in the British Memorandum to Salim’s ownership of the Island of Abu Musa having thus been refuted, and attention having been called to certain points which indirectly support the contention that he was the owner, reference will * The sentence “ the lease has remained up to now ” is also important in another connection. It can only mean that the lease has not yet expired. There is no mention here of a necessity for the recognition of the agreement by Sakar or of a right of Sakar to terminate it; while in his letter of February 22, 1908. he says: “ I did not repudiate it, and saw nothing objectionable in it, and so I acquiesced in it.” (Annex 5 of British Memorandum.) [2574 c—1] C6 now be made to certain circumstances which constitute direct evidence of Salim’s ownership. Salim has always exercised the right to wreckage on Abu Musa. In 1898 a boat belonging to Hassan Samaih grounded on Abu Musa. Salim claimed part of the cargo on account of his right to wreckage, but finally withdrew this claim in consequence of the intervention of Abdallatif, and informed the latter of his decision in a letter of 23rd March, 1898 (29 Shavval, 1315).* * * § ** Salim here speaks of the “ right belonging to us and of “ our Island of Abu Musa.” Further, a boat belonging to Abdallah Muhammed Hassan Alkhadja, a merchant of Lingah who had for many years carried on an active trade with the Oman coast, grounded on Abu Musa about seven years ago, and Salim, not Sakar, took possession of the boat and cargo as wreck. The question of the sum to be paid to Salim or the proportion of the cargo to be kept by him afterwards formed the subject of long negotiations with Salim, which Hassan Samaih and his son Abdallah conducted on behalf of Abdallah Muhammed. Sheikh Salim concluded two lease agreements respecting the oxide mines : the first on the 6th April, 1898 (14 Dulkade, 1315)4 the second on the 10th April, 1898 (18 Dulkade, 1315).§ The first was expressly cancelled by the second. Neither contains any reference to the regency or representation. . On the other hand, the first agreement contains the passage : “ So long as I, my children, and my brothers live no one shall have a right to raise objections to it (i.e., the lease).” This clearly expresses that Salim regarded himself as the owner, since he speaks of himself and his heirs, which would be impossible if he had only been acting as the representative of Sakar. If the lease agreement had been concluded in Sakar’s name, Salim could not have declared that no one (including, therefore, Sakar) was to have a right to raise objections, and, moreover, there would have been no sense in mentioning Salim’s heirs in the agreement. In the second agreement Salim further secured for himself an annual payment of 100 French reals for the trade in mother-of-pearl and canary seed. Salim has always levied this sum from the lessees as well as the rent. In the document of the 19th August, 1898 ( 1 Rebi-ul-Tani, 1315; Annex 3 of first German Memorandum), in which Sheikh Sakar announces his entry into the mining company, he expressly undertakes to pay a proportional part of the mother-of-pearl due. This is absolutely inconsistent with Sakar s assertion that he had granted to Salim only the rent of the oxide mines, and at the same time shows that Salim had a right to the enjoyment in his own name of all sources of profit to be derived from Abu Musa, and that he could exercise this right even as against the reigning sheikh. Another circumstance of particular importance in connection with the question as to which of the two sheikhs is the owner of Ahu Musa is, that on the 26th December, 1898 (12 Shaban, 1316),|| that is long after Sakar had returned and Salim’s regency had come to an end, Salim leased to Hassan Samaih, Abdallah, and Isa all the deposits of mica on Ahu Musa. Ihe lease is for a term of five years, and a total sum of 1,500 French reals is to be paid for it. In the document Salim expressly speaks of our Island of Abu Musa. ^ The price of the lease was paid to Salim by bill. - On the 6th January, 1899 (23 Shaban, 1316),Abdallatif sends to Hassan Samaih the draft of a Memorandum of Association respecting the working of both the oxide and t e mica mines, ff In sending it he observes that Sakar has seen the Memorandum, and wis les to ia\e a copy of it.4 Sakar, therefore, knew the terms of the agreement about the mica mines, and knew that the rent was paid to Salim, but he had no objection to make to the arrangement. If Salim has no right of any kind to the island, and if Sakar allows him to have the revenue from the oxide concession simply out of liberality, how is it that Salim of his own authority lets the mica deposits and takes the rent before Sakar’s very eyes, and without protest on his part? This rent of 1,500 French reals was a very con siderable sum to the Sheikhs Salim and Sakar, who are by no means rich Would * Annex 6. oW ^ The fi X 8t ff rs&lt; ?“ P)f ra ! is , in A rabic indiscriminately for the first person singular.

W 17 Sakar have given up such a sum to Salim, if he had had the least vestige of a right to it, without saying a word about this renunciation in his letter of the 22nd February, 1908, while he lays stress on his alleged grant of the 250 reals from the oxide mines as an act of particular generosity on his part, and cites it as evidence of his ownership of Abu Musa ? r In the document relative to the mica mines there is also a stipulation of importance to t ie effect that the lessees and their employes may cut down keshkeshuh trees, but no other trees. This provision, too, is evidence that Salim disposes of the island as owner. Another document which is of importance as bearing on the question of ownership, and which is connected with the mica concession, is the letter addressed by the British consular agent Abdallatif to Hassan Samaih on the 12th November, 1898 (27 Djumada II, 1316), ^ that is about a month and a-halt before the conclusion of the agreement respecting the mica mines. Abdallatif and Hassan Samaih were at that time negotiating with Salim both in regard to this concession and also in regard to another concession for the exploitation of the salt and copper on the Island of Sir Abu Nuair. Abdallatif writes that a dispute lias arisen between Salim and Sakar in regard to Sir. He says that Sakar proposes to conclude the lease agreement in his own name, and only allow Salim a share of the profits, an arrangement which does not satisfy Salim. So that Salim must have some reason for considering that Sir also belongs to him. In any case the question is not settled, and the cautious Abdallatif, who has an accurate knowledge of the circumstances, postpones the matter until the two sheikhs shall have settled the point between them. While Abdallatif is unwilling to conclude an arrangement about Sir because Saxar raises a claim to the island and Salim’s right to it is disputed (the Sir concession was never granted), he has no hesitation in concluding an agreement with Salim about Abu Musa. Surely he would not have done this if he had had the slightest doubt of Salim’s title, more especiall) as there was already a dispute respecting Sir. Moreover, Sakar, who, as shown above, was aware of the terms of the mica concession, would certainly have tried in this case, as in that of Sir, to make good bis real or alleged rights, especially as a sum of 1,500 reals, a not inconsiderable amount for him, was involved. If he did not do so, that is evidence that he had no doubt himself that Salim was the owner of the island. The facts given above are clear evidence that the Island of Abu Musa is the private property of Sheikh Salim. This conclusion is supported by the opinion prevailing among the most respectable natives on the poin-t in question. The merchant, Abdalmuhsin-ibn-Ahmed Almushari, who has had an intimate acquaintance with the affairs of the Pirate Coast for many years ; the merchant, French consular agent, Abdarrahman-ibn-Muhammed-ibn-Kazim, who has permanent trade connections with Shargeh ; as well as Hamd-ibn-Khalifa Al’uyuni, merchant and agent of the Sultan of Muscat—all three residents of Lingah—have declared in writing that to their certain knowledge Abu Musa has always been, and still is, the free property of Salim, f The two last-mentioned have also assured the Imperial vice-consul at Bushire orally that everyone who has any knowledge of affairs on the Arabian Coast knows this as well as they do. But even if it be possible to doubt Salim’s right to Abu Musa as its formal owner according to European legal principles, it cannot be questioned that he exercised, with the consent of the reigning sheikh, and even as against him, the full right of disposal of the usufruct, just like an owner. The English view, indeed, is that Sakar is the owner of the oxide mines, and that Salim concluded the lease agreement respecting them as his representative only. But even in that case Sakar had no right, from the point of view of private law, to terminate the agreement of his own motion. The lease agreement of the 10th April, 1898, states expressly that the lease shall run for so long as the lessees “ have an interest in the aforesaid mines.” So that the lessees only are to have the right to terminate, and not the lessor. It will be seen that this was the intention of the parties if the first lease agreement, dated the 6th April, 1898, is referred to for comparison. In this agreement, which was concluded only with Hassan Samaih and his son Abdallah, the right of working the mines is given to the lessees for so long as they find oxide, but for not longer than twenty vears, with the proviso that they can terminate the agreement at any time on paying one year’s rent. Here already a long term was agreed upon for the benefit of the lessees. Thereupon Abdallatif’s son Isa was received as a partner, and the new * Annex 15. f Annexes 16 to 18.8 lease agreement of the 10th April, 1898, was drafted by Abdallatif. The oxide business was at that time considered very profitable. The lessees, and especially Abdallatif, therefore wished to secure it for as long as possible. Accordingly the stipulation of a definite term of years was omitted in the second agreement. And in order to exclude any possible doubt as to the bearing of the two agreements upon each other, it was expressly laid down in the second agreement that any agreements previously concluded^* were to be considered null and void and that the second agreement alone was to be binding. Apart from the fact that it is the universal practice in that region, and a common practice in other parts of the world, to insert such a clause in agreements of this kind, the clause in this case serves the practical purpose of invalidating, expressis verbis, the provisions of the former agreement. But the lessees would certainly not have consented to an alteration of the first agreement if their rights had thereby been diminished. The history of the origin of the final lease agreement accordingly shows clearly that it was the intention of the parties that the lessor should be permanently bound, while the lessees should be at liberty to terminate the agreement. This intention has been expressed in the agreement in a manner that cannot be misunderstood. How, in spite of the clear wording of the two agreements, it can be said that there is no real lease agreement, but only “ a mere permit to the partners terminable on either side at any time,” is as difficult to understand as the attempt to draw from the right of the lessees to terminate the agreement and from the clause cancelling previous agree ments the conclusion that the lessor had also reserved to himself the right to terminate the contract. These conclusions are certainly not supported by the documents bearing on the matter. It appears from one of Sakar’s letters to Hassan Samaih (Annex 12 of the first German Memorandum) that one of the considerations which chiefly induced Sakar to take steps against the company of lessees was the idea that he would suffer loss in consequence of the agreement of the lessees with Wonckhaus. In connection with the other pretexts brought forward by Sakar in his various letters to Hassan Samaih, it may be conjectured that here, too, we have to deal with an apprehension on the part of Sakar which belongs rather to the realm of politics, and which will be discussed later (pp. 17, 18), namely, that the agreement with Wonckhaus might tend to bring about the gradual separation of the Island of Abu Musa from the dominions of the sheikh. The British Memorandum gives a different explanation of this matter, and states in justification of Sakar s attitude that, in view of the rise of the price of oxide in the market, his pecuniary interest in the mines w r as not properly safeguarded by the rent of 250 reals fixed for an indefinite time. In other words, Sakar cannot recognise the lease agree ment any longer if the other party makes large profits in consequence of the rise of market prices, while he (as lessor) has to be contented with the rent; the lessor is therefore bound by the agreement only so long as the lessee does not make considerably more than the amount of the rent. It may be that Sheikh Sakar’s ideas of the limits of legality and violence are somewhat undeveloped, and that he considers himself bound by agreements only so long as he profits more by them than the other contracting party. If, however, he were allowed to put such ideas into practice it would involve the admission that Europeans or the proteges of European Powers have no rights whatever in the territory of an Arabian sheikh, and that it is permissible for the latter to act as he pleases without regard for good faith or legality. During the long years when the company was working at a loss he did nothing. Now, when there is a prospect of more profitable business foi the future, he discovers that the rent is not sufficient. If Sakar wished to participate in the gains of the company, he ought to have retained his share in the company and borne a proportional part of its losses. Surely the object of the agreement between Wonckhaus and the company of lessees is, on the one hand, to make the purchaser of the oxide independent of the fluctuations of tbe maiket and insure his obtaining a certain quantity at a fixed price, and, on the othei hand, to enable the working company to count with certainty upon selling a definite quantity and obtaining a certain income. Supposing that the market value of oxide fell below the price agreed upon between Wonckhaus and the company of lessees, this would, accoi ding to Sheikh Sakar s ideas of justice, give the German firm the right to declare : “ As in these circumstances the mining company is earning money while we are losing, we consider the agreement as no longer valid.” Fiom the legal point of view, the question whether, assuming that Sakar is the lessor, he is able to terminate the lease agreement because the lessee has begun to earn money and the rent does not appear sufficient to him, Sakar, is one that cannot be9 discussed seriously The point has been examined here only in order to show the weakness of the position taken up by Sakar. 7 On the question of the termination of the lease agreement opinions- have been Sporti c Wvt e a , r mg . “ e , rohan * st ^Lingah and Bussorah, a^d from ^ mo^t f and Debai,§ who have given their views on the ttei from the point of view of commercial law and from that of religious law The slTittedTrth ade ' m th6 f T m rf Ual •'? that • regi ° n ’ the a g reeme nt in question being submitted to them m copy, together with certain questions in writing, and their opinions based, if™ 11 W ' detalled Statem6nt ° f the l6gal grOUnds ^ which they were tl o r. AU * he ,°P lnlons come practically to the same conclusion. The legal construction of the case is, however, not the same in commercial law as in religious law According to commercial law, the lease agreement is valid; the lessor cannot the^reeine,d ft “ T “ ^ ^ ” the ° b j ect leased in accordance with the agreement. The agreement could only be terminated by amicable arrangement, since the lessor was not forced to sign it, but did so of his own free will. was sflmdot 'f g f t0 J? hglOUS la Y, the ! ease agreement is invalid, because a consideration was stipulated for the use of the mines, while oxide and similar minerals lying on the surface are the common property of all Mohammedans, and the lessor has accordingly on erred a right which he did not possess. But any person who discovers or works the mines thereby acquires the right to exploit them, and is at liberty to dispose of the produce as he chooses Sheikh Salim or Sheikh Sakar, whichever of them is to be considered the lessor, has no claim to the rent, and Hassan Samaih or the company of lessees lias, by working the mines, acquired a right to them. The Ruler of the territory cannot dispose of the mines, and he cannot prevent the person who has acquired them by working them from exercising his right. So that both the commercial law and the religious law forbid the lessor to terminate the agreement, the latter absolutely, and the former on the assumption that tlje lessee acts m accordance with the terms of the agreement. This has been done. e 101lt lias . ' )e en paid regularly. i he sale to foreigners is not a breach of the agreement since it is not forbidden by the agreement ; indeed, it is expressly contemplated m the Memorandum of Association (pp. 14, 15), which will be mentioned further on, with the consent of Sakar as at that time a shareholder. Accordingly, neither Sakar nor Salim has a right to terminate the agreement. (B-) Ihe Position of Sheikh Sakar with respect to the Company of Lessees FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF PUBLIC LAW. As observed m the British Memorandum, the reigning Sheikh of Shargeh is the absolute ruler of his country. The final appeal is accordingly to him in all matters concerning the political administration of his country. The British Memorandum further remarks that the principal object of Sakar was to administer justice as between Ahe partners of the company on the strength of his “ sovereign rights of jurisdiction.” In connection with this point, the question must be considered as to whether^ Sakar had authority to decide as judge the dispute between the partners of the mining company, and whether the decision arrived at was justified by law, or whether 1m had power to cancel the lease at his discretion in the interest of the administration of the country. * Annexes 19 to 24. t Some of the Lingah merchants come from the Oman coast, have branches or ag-ents there and have for many years been doing- a very active trade with the places on the Oman coast; they have therefore an accurate knowledge of the mercantile customary law there. Among the opinions is that of Abdallah Muhammed Hassan Alkhadja, a man who, on account of his experience and reputation, is a recognized arbitrator in commercial matters, whose opinion is asked for by Persians and Arabians of the Persian and Arabian coasts as far as Bahrein, and to whose decisions they willingly submit. J Among the religious opinions are those of Muhammed Mahdi-ibn-Abdallah and Yussuf-ibn-Muhammprl- ibn-Abdallah, judges at Lingah. § Annexes 25 to 31. || To the clergy at Shargeh and Debai was submitted a fictitious agreement, the contents of which were in harmony with the agreement of April 10, 1898, in which only the names of persons and places were changed, and dates were spoken of instead of mother-of-pearl, and “ mines ” mentioned instead of “ oxide mines.” In obtaining opinions it is usual in the Persian Gulf to submit fictitious agreements whenever it is desired to conceal the names of persons and things, and so obviate the possibility of the referee being influenced. [2574 c — 1J D10 1. Could Sheikh Sakar cancel the Lease Agreement hy a Judicial Decision ? Sheikh Sakar bases his letter of the 22nd February, 1907 (9 Moharrem, 1325) (Annex 12 of the first German Memorandum), in which lie informs Hassan Samaih of the cancellation of the lease agreement, on a complaint made to him by IsatiS'' the conclusion of the agreement with Wonckhaus, of which Isa did not approve anu about which he stated he had not been consulted. In consequence of the representa tions made by Hassan Samaih, Isa’s complaint is again referred to in the second decision, dated the 26th March, 1907 (11 Safar, 1325) (Annex 16 of the first German Memorandum). Sheikh Sakar himself very wisely does not anywhere state that he wished to play the part of a judge, for according to Mohammedan public law it is impossible for the Sovereign to assume the functions ot a judge. A judgment can only be given by a judge appointed by the Sovereign. But the following further objection may be taken to the view adopted in the British Memorandum : if Sakar is the owner and lessor of the mines, as maintained in the British Memorandum, that circumstance alone is sufficient to preclude him from being a judge in this matter. It is, moreover, surprising that the British Government, as must be inferred from the Memorandum, should admit the jurisdiction of a sheikh on the Pirate Coast over British subjects, and that, too, in a case where the defendant Hassan Samaih resides, not in Shargeh, but at Lingah, in Persian territory, and therefore in the judicial district of the British consulate-general at Bushire, while the company itself has its head-quarters and domicil for judicial purposes at Lingah. so that the principle, acter sequitur forum rei, which is generally so strictly followed in the East, would appear to have been dropped in this case. But assuming that Sheikh Sakar had taken upon himself to act as judge in his own case, in spite of such a course being contrary to the principles of Mohammedan public law, it still remains to consider the further question whether his decision, i.e. % cancelling of the lease agreement and withdrawal of the mines, was in itself legally admissible. Isa complains that Hassan Samaih has concluded the agreement with Wonckhaus and in doing so has exceeded his power, and he is afraid that his interests in the company will be injured by this agreement. It would have been the duty of the judge to consider whether in concluding this agreement Hassan Samaih did really exceed his powers, or whether, if he had authority to conclude the agreement, its conclusion had, nevertheless, injured the other shareholders. If the judge found for the plaintiff, the judgment could only be either to the effect that the agreement had been concluded by an unauthorised person and was, therefore, not binding on the company—in which case the question ot the amount of compensation to be paid to Mr. W^dnckhaus would have had to be settled between the latter and Hassan Samaih—or to the effect that, although the agreement had been properly concluded and the company were bound to carry out its stipulations, Hassan Samaih was liable to make good' to the other shareholders the damage thereby entailed on them. It may be admitted that a construction of the case in question according to the rules of European logic cannot be expected as a matter of course from an Arabian sheikh, and that is why apart from other considerations—such a sheikh is not usually allowed to pronounce a judgment where the subjects of a European State are con cerned. But what one is justified in expecting is that the judgment even of an Arabian sheikh shall not violate natural justice as it has been violated in the present case. The dispute between the shareholders is not about the mines themselves, but entirely about a question of the administration of the company, the question, namely, whether a certain individual partner had authority to perform a certain legal act and whether this legal act was in the interest of the whole body or not. And what does the judge do? He, who is being appealed to bv one party to piotect its rights which are believed to be threatened, and who ought to guard the interests of both plaintiff and defendant, doing justice between them impartially, does violence not only to both parties but also to the remaining shareholders who are outside the dispute, simply taking away from the company and putting in his own pocket the whole valuable object m connection with winch the company was founded and in which he alleges that he has himself a financial interest which is not being duly satisfied. That was an arbitrary act of the worst kind. If, nevertheless, the British Memorandum says! &lt;c In no sense of the word does the conduct of the sheikh appear to have been illegal,” and if this is intended as a defence not only of the manner in which Sheikh Sakar carried out his decision, but also of the admisssibility of the decision itself, this line of argument becomes intelligible onlywhen it is remembered that the Memorandum starts from the assumption that Hassan feamaih s proceedings were culpable. The argument of the British Memorandum so far as this question is concerned, is as follows :— _ Q “.. lt ia . ?l eai 'f n agreement of such scope as that concluded between Hassan ^bamaih and Mr. Wonckhaus ought to have been previously laid before all the parties interested, that was not done, and at least two of the partners did not give their consent to tne agreement. ^ But Hassan Samaih had no right to conclude the aoreement without the knowledge of the other partners, for he was not the manager. Therefore Isas complaint was well founded.” The Imperial Government, however, maintain that the partners did, as a matter of fact, sanction the agreement between Hassan Samaih and Mr. Wonckhaus, but that this sanction was not really necessary, as Hassan Samaih is the manager of the company. With regard to the question whether the partners approved the agreement, the following peisons aie concerned besides Isa : Nedjef, son of the former partner Nakhoda Ah Ahmed Salih, of Bunder Abbas, and Malcolm, of Bushire. Nedjef asserts in his letter to Lieutenant Gabriel, British vice-consul at Bunder Abbas, of the 16th February, 1908 (Annex 18 ot the British Memorandum), that he did not gi^ e his sanction to the agreement, and did not sign it. With regard to this it must in the first place be pointed out that it is disputed that Nedjef was a partner. Ihe mattei stands thus : his father, Nakhoda Ah, as is clearly shown in the agreement regarding his entry as a partner (Annex 2 of the first German Memorandum), had a share on the strength of his engaging to superintend the work at the mines’ without putting capital into the concern. I his partnership was accordingly connected with personal services, and therefore ceased when those services came to an end, that is, at Nakhoda Ali s death. That at any rate, was formerly Abdallatif’s view, as is clearly shown by the latter part of his letter to Hassan Samaih of the 23rd June, 1905 (19 Rebi II, 1323).* ^ This view is shared by Hassan Samaih and Abdallah, and the former energetically denied to the Imperial vice-consul at Bushire that he had ever recognised Aedjef as a partner. I hat Nedjef s father was not really a partner, but only an employ4 of the company with a share in the profits, is especially clear from the fact that he did not take part in the reception of Sheikh Sakar into the company, and that it w^as not considered necessary for him to sign the document on the subject (Annex 4 a of the first German Memorandum), although it was not a case of a simple transfer of a share already existing, but of the creation of a new share, and therefore the diminution of the rights of the remaining partners. Whatever decision may be arrived at on the question of Nedjef s partnership, a question which will have to be settled amongst the partners themselves, it is certain that Nedjef on several occasions expressed to third parties his approval of the proceedings of Hassan Samaih, and that therefore no credence can be given to his assertions in tie letter of the 16th February, 1908, referred to above. In particular, at the end of November 1907, at Bunder Abbas’he said to Abdallah, son of Hassan Samaih, in the presence of the dragoman of the Imperial vice consulate at Bushire, that he entirely approved of the agreement with Wonckhaus, and of everything else that Hassan Samaih did, and that he regarded him and honoured him as a second father.t Moreover, when the British subject Brown, of the firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Co. was temporarily at Bunder Abbas in March 1908, Nedjef offered to sell him his (or rather his father’s) share in the mining company; at the same time he stated that be entirely approved of the agreement for the supply of oxide concluded between Hassan Samaih and Mr. Wonckhaus. Mr. Brown decided not to buy the share only because he knew that Hassan Samaih, Abdallah, and Abdallatif disputed Nedjefs partnership. Mr. Brown has made a declaration, the truth of which he is ready to confirm by an oath,j in regard to this incident. It would therefore appear that the statements made by Nedjef in his letter of protest of the 16th February, 1908, denying his approval, which letter was communicated to Lieutenant Gabriel a month before the offer to Mr. Brown mentioned above, are not in accordance with the facts. Otherwise the}’ would have to be considered as retracted by the statement made by Nedjef to Mr. Brown a month afterwards to the effect that he entirely approved of the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus for the supply of oxide. * Annex 32. f The Imperial Dragoman, Mirza Abdul Hussein, was on that occasion on his way to Shargeh accompanied by Abdallah, and had to wait at Bunder Abbas for the steamer to Shargeh. He has declared officially that during the conversation between Abdallah and Nedjef he simply listened and made no attempt to influence Nedjef. He says that Abdallah, too, used no persuasion with Nedjef, and that the latter expressed his approval entirely of his own accord. — f Annex 33.12 No objection to the agreement with Wonckhaus was raised by the British protdgd T. J. Malcolm, of Bushire, of whom the British Memorandum only says that the lessees had “ engagements ” with him, while as a matter of fact he had entered the company two years after the conclusion of the lease agreement and paid capital into it once, being the only partner except Hassan Samaih who has paid in any. In the British Memorandum it is made a matter of reproach to Hassan Samaih that, in reply to£^ Malcolm’s letter of the 26th June, 1906, asking for a copy of the agreement, he, in the first place, answered on the 13th July, 1906, that the agreement was drawn up in German, and that in a later letter, dated the 14th October, 1906, he again declined to supply a copy on the ground that Mr. Wonckhaus had asked him not to say anything about this business (Annexes 13, 14, of British Memorandum). No doubt Hassan Samaih ought not to have made use of the excuse that the agreement was in German ; but his anxiety to keep the terms of the agreement secret as long as possible, and especially not to communicate them to the firm of A. and T. J. Malcolm, is explained by business considerations. For Malcolm was a competitor, since his firm of A. and T. J. Malcolm is an agent for, and a shareholder in, the British firm of Strick and Co., in whose hands the Ormuz oxide trade is. Hassan Samaih had put his whole fortune of about 100,000 rupees into the Abu Musa oxide concern, which had so far been run at a loss, and which he now hoped would at last improve in consequence of the agree ment with Mr. Wonckhaus. He saw a great danger in the agreement getting to be known too early. Subsequent events have shown how well-founded his apprehension of further difficulties was. Although Hassan Samaih did not send Malcolm the copy of the agreement in the first instance, he nevertheless, in his letter of the 13th July, 1906, communicated to him all that was of importance in it, as is seen from Annex 13 of the British Memorandum; in particular he did not, as alleged in the British Memorandum, omit to answer the question whether other European firms could make similar agreements, but said straight out: “ We can therefore make no other contract.’' In his reply of the 30th October, 1906 (11 Ramadan, 1324),* Malcolm says he will see whether it would be possible to sell the red oxide at a higher price or to get better terms, oi whether, if it were found possible to obtain a higher price, the agreement could be cancelled oi not. He further expressly states : “If we are not sure of getting a higher price, we shall not get the former agreement cancelled.” In other words, Malcolm would have liked to get a higher price and better terms, and if he found he could get such he would have liked either to come to an arrangement with Mr Wonck haus as to other terms, or if he (Malcolm) was able to obtain them from another party, to persuade Mr. Wonckhaus to allow the agreement to be cancelled by amicable arrangement. It follows from this, however, that he considered the agreement as perfectly valid m itself. W hen Malcolm, later on, received a copy of the agreement, ne said no more about it, and accordingly acquiesced in it. It appears from a letter addressed by Abdallatif to Hassan Samaih, on the nTn J ^\ 1323 )'t and a letter from the latter to Abdallatif of the +i ^ j + 1 ° e !’ ° ia ^ an ’ l°^3), (Annex 9 of the first German Memorandum) that at that tune a considerable quantity of oxide was already being sold to Mr. Wdnck- haus and that it was proposed to supply oxide to Wonckhaus at a fixed price annually. As the correspondence shows, Abdallatif'agreed to this. After the conclusion of the agreement of the 1st June, 1906, with Mr. Robert Wonckhaus for the delivery of oxide, assail Samam communicates the fact to Abdallatif on the 11th June (18 Rebi II 1324) Tl' V* 1 ] t \r Same t i me . lnfo T rm ® J 11 ' 1 ot ‘ the substance of the agreement (Annex 11 of the Erit'sh Memorandum). In his reply of the 14th June, 1906 (21 Rebi II, 1324),$ w uc i ias now ecome o importance, Abdallatif openly expresses his satisfaction at He conclusion of the business, and the hope that better times are coming at last w hich will compensate for the sacrifices and disappointments of the past.

This is the meaning which must be attached to the letter when considered impartially. of thi« Wt enmn al1 , le , jll S 18 1 translation (Annex 12 of the British Memorandum) of this letter correspond almost word for word. In particular the English translation too * Annex 34. f Annex 32. | Annex 35.makes it imposBible to doubt Abdallatifs absolute concurrence in the agreement with i r ’„^ n( 5^ aus ' P assa ges in the English translation which bear on the point are the foliowingf:— Very good ; I hope it is auspicious. It will be good fortune after trouble. In &gt;*|y case, our brother Abdullah must reach there to supervise the work, because I think ^e operations cannot be regulated without him At any rate, I am glad to hear this news, if we are safe from this world’s tricks more than before.” When the British Memorandum says : “ Abdallatif comments upon the transaction m guarded language,” it is adopting an interpretation which entirely ignores the passages just quoted, and gives disproportionate weight to the following sentence which is in very general terms :— “ Please, however, refrain from entering upon any arrangements whatever in the nature of leases or deeds of contract from which there will arise difficulties and quarrels which will lead to complaints and claims . . . .” After all, any agreement may lead to difficulties and quarrels, which cannot be foreseen^ But even if we go so far as to see in this sentence a condition which Abdallatif wishes to attach to the consent which he has already given, the condition that is, that the agreement must not be a kind of lease, it must be said that this condition is completely fulfilled, for the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus is simply a contract for delivery and not a lease contract. It is not till about four months later that Abdallatif, in a letter dated the 3rd October, 1906 (14 Shaban, 1324), begs Hassan Samaih to send him a copy of the agreement with Wonckhaus (Annex 7 of first German Memorandum). The reason for this is not that doubts have now suddenly arisen in Abdallatif’s mind in regard to the agreement, but simply that “the consul” would like to see the agreement.* On the 16th December, 1906 (27 Shaval, 1324), Hassan Samaih complies with this request (Annex 15 of British Memorandum). On the 23rd January, 1907 (8 Dulhidje, 1324),t Abdallatif replies that his son Isa is not satisfied with the agreement, because he was not asked his opinion and because he fears that difficulties may arise from the business connection with foreigners. He also reproaches Hassan Samaih for having exercised his own discretion in entering into the engagement, whereas he surely ought not to have bound himself without\onsulting the other partners. He goes on to say : “ It is better to try to cancel the agreement than to do as he (the German) wishes.’’J The fact that Abdallatif only blames the inde pendent action of Hassan Samaih points to the conclusion that he does not dispute the legal validity of the agreement, and this is made quite clear by a consideration of that short passage in the letter which deals with the question what is to be done now. Abdallatif simply advises that an attempt should be made to cancel the agreement. The British Memorandum translates the passage in question as follows :— “ The nullification of this agreement is better than its acceptance,” and explains that the phrase “ is better ” is a euphemism, common in the Arabic epistolary style, expressing a definite decision. In view, however, of the two enclosed opinions,§ which, while differing in details, in the result arrived at entirely support the view of the Imperial Government, the latter must adhere to their contention that the meaning of the passage in question can only be that the attempt should be made to cancel the agreement. But this assumes that the agreement is legally valid. In giving this advice, Abdallatif himself admits that the agreement has legal force. Furthermore, Abdallatif in his next letter, dated the 27th March, 1907 (12 Sefer, 1325), || again admits that he originally, that is in his letter of the 14th June, 1906 (21 Bebi II, 1324), concurred in the agreement. It is not easy to * In the circumstances this can only mean the British Consul, with whom Abdallatif, as consular agent, is officially connected. f Annex 36. t It is noticeable that Abdallatif allows more than a month to pass—he received the letter on December 21, 1906, as appears from the letter of March 27, 1907—before he sends the answer, whereas previously when Hassan Sumaili informed him of the conclusion of the agreement only throe days elapsed between the date of dispatch of this communication and the date on which he sent off his reply concurring. Thus we evidently have not here a spontaneous decision of Abdallatif founded entirely on his examination of the terms of the agreement. § Annexes 37 and 38. || Annex 39. [25 7J C —1] E14 understand how the British Memorandum can come to the opposite conclusion, when, even in the translation of the letter there printed (Annex 17 of the British Memorandum), we find the passage :— “ I sent you back an answer, dated the 21st Rebi II, 1324, which purported to convey acquiescence ” The facts cited above show that Nejef—if, indeed, he is to be considered a partner at all—as well as Malcolm and Abdallatif, the latter as the representative of his son Isa, declared their approval of the conclusion of the agreement between Hassan Samaih and Mr. Wonckhaus. Of course, the legal position is not affected by the circumstance that Nejef and Abdallatif subsequently denied that they had given their approval, or by the fact that, in particular, Abdallatif, after he had procured a copy of the agreement for the British consul, changed his mind about the agreement. But, apart from this, the Imperial Government are, moreover, of opinion that there was no necessity for Hassan Samaih to obtain the concurrence of the other partners, as he was the manager of the company. The circumstances of locality, apart from anything else, made it absolutely necessary that one of the partners should be authorised to represent the company alone in dealings with other persons, and to bind the company by his acts without the previous approval of the other partners. Isa lives at Shargeh, Malcolm at Bushire, Nejef—assuming that he is a partner—at Bunder Abbas, Hassan Samaih at Lingah. From Lingah to Bushire and from Bunder Abbas to Lingah there is a weekly post, from Bushire to Lingah and from Lingah to Bunder Abbas only a fortnightly post. Postal communication with Shargeh has only been established within the last few years ; at the time when the company was founded there were only sailing-boats available for the journey, which took from three to ten days, according to the weather, to reach Lingah from Shargeh. Telegraphic communication is entirely wanting on the Oman Coast; the telegraph station on the Island of Henjam can be reached from Lingah by sailing-boat in from two to four days; the conveyance of a telegram from Henjam to Lingah takes the same time. How is it possible to imagine a properly conducted business with such bad means of communication if the managing partner, before con cluding a business transaction, has to ask the opinion of three people living respectively at Shargeh, Bushire, and Bunder Abbas, await their replies, perhaps answer objections, modify certain provisions in accordance with the wishes of one of the partners, and then again refer to the others for their sanction of the modifications ? This state of things being duly taken into consideration, a Memorandum of Association was agreed upon in which the rights and duties of the manager are regulated . with some detail. In a letter dated the 6th January, 1899 (23 Shaban, 1316),* Abdallatif sent the Memorandum ot Association, which he had himself drawn up, to Hassan Samaih at Lingah, and requested that all the partners there, i.e., Hassan Samaih, Abdallah, and Nakhoda Ah, would sign it and then send it back. In sending it he observes that Sheikhs Salim and Sakar have seen the Memorandum, ami that Sakar has asked foi a copy, which shows that Sakar, too, approved of the Memorandum. Hassan Samaih, Abdallah, and Nakhoda Ali signed the Memorandum, added an additional article, No. 6, providing for the purchase of four large and four small boats at the 'expense of the company, and sent the altered Memorandum to Abdallatif, Hassan Samaih keeping a copy. On the -1st January, 1899 (9 Ramadan, 1316),f Abdallatif wrote that he had shown the Memorandum to Isa and Sakar, J but that they had not agreed to the engagement of eight boats for the service of the company. No other objections were raised, which is quite natural, as the remainder of the Memorandum had been drafted by Abdallatif himself, and had already been agreed to by the partners living at Shargeh. As Hassan Samaih at once replied that he and the two other partners at Lingah consented to the cancelling of the boats, all the partners were now in agreement as to the contents of the Memorandum of Association. No fresh copy of the Memorandum was made, and none was necessary, since the correspondence which had passed showed tiat all had approved, of its contents. In consequence of the adoption of this new Memorandum of Association, the older provisions not in harmony with it, which were agieed upon when fNakhoda Ali joined in May 1898, of course ceased to be in force. * Annexes 13 and 14. f Annex 40. ... + ^ le ( ommur hcation of the Memorandum to Sakar is explained by the fact that at that time he was still a partner.15 re The an an^cments made at that time for working together, however, had reference only to the collection of mother-of-pearl. (Annex 2 of the first German Memorandum.) Aow, according to Article 1 of the Memorandum of Association, Hassan Samaih is to be the foremost, i.e., the leader, in the necessary negotiations with the foreign* merchants^ for the exploitation of the mines; he will sign “ Hassan-ibn-Ali and JGompany, an( ^ W1 J^ explain to the partners how the negotiations and sales undertaken oy him in connection with the different mines stand. Hassan Samaih, then, carries on the negotiations ; he alone has authority to sign for the firm, and consequently to conclude for it.f Externally, too, the circumstance that the firm is called after him only, and that the remaining partners are collectively represented by “ and Company,” goes to show the prominent position which he occupied in the company. Hassan Samaih is simply to keep the partners informed of what is going on, letting them know of the negotiations and of the sales concluded. It would be impossible to express more clearly than is here done that Hassan Samaih is the sole manager of the company, and that he is the person who is particularly authorised to conclude the sales with foreign merchants without being bound to secure the co-operation of the remaining partners. That this is the meaning of article 1 is, moreover, shown with particular clearness by the circumstance that, in the articles which follow, those cases are expressly mentioned in which the concurrence of the other partners is on each occasion necessary. The principle observed is quite clear: in the case of transactions which are intended to bring in revenue to the company, and which often necessitate a rapid decision, as, for instance, the conclusion of sales, the manager acts quite independently ; but where it is a case of spending money for the company and throwing a burden on the individual partners, their concurrence must first be obtained. Hassan Samaih, as a matter of fact, always availed himself of his powers as manager from the time that the company was founded, and this is shown by a number of the letters in the annexes inter alia. He concluded sales independently, amongst others, previously with the firm of Wonckhaus and Co., he kept the company’s books, and signed with the signature of the firm. The post delivered to him all letters addressed to the firm. The other partners raised no objections to these proceedings, and even if the above-mentioned Memorandum of Association did not exist, one would be justified in concluding that the partners concurred in his acting as manager from the fact that he occupied the position for many years without opposition. ButThere are further proofs that Hassan Samaih was always recognised as manager. When on one occasion difficulties arose in connection with a sale of oxide, and Hassan Samaih asked Malcolm for advice, the latter answered, on the 2nd February, 1901 (12 Shaval, 1318)4 that he, Malcolm, could not do anything, although he w^as a partner, because an individual partner had not a right to act. That the firm of Strick and Co., too, had partners, but an individual partner of that firm could not engage in law-suits for the firm, hut only a person authorised to do so; and that Hassan Samaih must bring the action himself. It could not be stated more distinctly that Hassan Samaih is the manager of the company. After the cancellation of the lease agreement by Sakar, Hassan Samaih asked Malcolm for his advice as to what he should do. Malcolm answered, in a letter dated the 7th November, 1907,§ that, as Hassan was a British subject, he had better apply to the British consulate-general. That is to say, a partner, who is not authorised to represent the firm himself, advises the managing partner to take steps on behalf of the firm. In a letter dated the 13th July, 1902 (7 Bebi II, 1320),|| Malcolm makes an offer, addressed to Alhadj Hassan-ibn-Samaih and Co., on behalf of Strick and Co. Hassan Samaih is to telegraph his reply and to guarantee the quality of the oxide. Nothing is said of the other partners ; their concurrence, which, indeed, could not have been obtained in time, is not asked for. Here, again, Hassan Samaih appears as the * * * § * In the Arabic text the word “ eledjnebiye ”— u foreign is used. f In the British Memorandum Hassan Samaih is blamed for describing himself in the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus as ‘‘ owner and holder of Bu Musa Concession.” These words appear only in the heading of the agreement and are inaccurate for the reason that Hassan left out the words and Co.” But the signature to the agreement, which alone has legal force, and which was affixed in the form prescribed in the Memorandum of Association, clearly shows that Ilassan Samaih signed, not for himself personalty, but for the company. ± Annex 41. § Annex 42. || Annex 43.16 manager authorised to conclude independently. It is not a case of a single sale, but of an agreement, very similar to that with Wonckhaus, under which the company are bound to the offer for six months until the arrival of Strick and Co’s, answer, and may not sell to anyone else for six months after the loading of the oxide. It remains to examine the question whether Hassan Samaih injured the company^^ by the conclusion of the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus and whether Isa would have***' been justified in complaining on this ground. It appears, from the account of Isa’s complaint given in the British Memorandum, that the company is held to have been injured by the circumstance that, in consequence of the agreement with Mr. Wdnckbaus, it is precluded from profiting by any rise that may take place in the price of oxide. That is an objection that might be raised against any contract for delivery concluded for a certain term, and is of no importance so far as Mr. Wonckhaus is concerned. There might possibly, indeed, be a question whether the agreement as a whole is injurious to the interests of the company, and whether in the circumstances Hassan Samaih, as a good man of business, was justified in concluding sucli an agreement for the company. The provisions of the agreement are in substance as follows. The company is bound to deliver to Mr. Wonckhaus free on board ship at Abu Musa annually for a term of four years 2,000 to 5,000 tons of oxide of a particular quality at the price of 155. 6d. per ton. Mr. Wonckhaus is bound to pay this price and to take at least 2,000 tons, and, further, if he requires more, and there is enough oxide, to buy up to 5,000 tons. On the other hand, the company may not sell oxide to anyone else, with the exception of about 5,000 to 6,000 sacks, which it may sell to India. On the expiration of the agreement Mr. Wonckhaus has the right of renewing the agreement on the same terms or the terms offered by another serious applicant. For a proper appreciation of this agreement it must be remembered that the company had till then worked at a heavy loss. It appears from the books of the company—which were kept very neatly, clearly, and well—that the total expenditure from the commencement of the works to the beginning of December 1908 amounted to 301,043 rupees.On the other side, the receipts amount to 207,804 rupees, so that there is a deficit of 93,209 rupees. These figures show that the financial position of the company was very bad, and that it would have had to work at a profit for a long time before the previous losses could have been made good and a dividend declared. The agreement with M. Wonckaus gave the company an opportunity of selling, at a fixed price, which was independent of the fluctuations of the market, and was guaranteed to it for a number of years, a considerable minimum quantity of oxide, and possibly two and a-half times as much. The company was therefore in a position to count with certainty on receiving a minimum of 1,550/. a-year, and to arrange its whole work accordingly. These receipts might be raised to 3,875/., not counting what was sold to India. The prospects of the company from a commercial point ol view were therefore such as it had never had before. It was in the nature of things that the company should have to accept into the bargain certain limitations and obligations. Agreements like the one in question between producers and merchants are usual in all parts of the world, and if a normal price and a fixed minimum sale are guaranteed to the producer, he on his part must give security to the merchant, who makes Ins arrangements accordingly, that the article shall not suddenly be diverted into the hands of his competitors. The chief point is that the risk to the producer here sinks to a minimum, while the risk to the merchant remains great. He is bound to take over the minimum quantity at the guaranteed price, and runs the risk of having to do so when the market price is such that he is obliged to sell the article at a small profit or no profit at all, or even at a loss, or he may ‘have to buy it when he cannot sell it at all. It is likewise a very ordinary thing that, in view of these possibilities, the price should irom the first be fixed at such a figure that a certain margin is left to the merchant, since otherwise the latter could not take part in the transaction at all. The circumstance also deserves particular consideration that, in a case like the one under discussion, the producer is not in a position to avail himself of the opportunities of gain to the same extent as the merchant. However skilled in business Hassan Samaih and Abdallatil may be, it will not be possible for them to dispose of the produce of the oxide mines on Abu Musa directly and without the interposition of a middleman, and to profit by the constant changes in the international market, as they do not possess either the * * In the account of expenditure is included 5 per cenl. simple interest on the total sum, which Hassan Samaih reckons as due to himself, since, apart from the 2,000 rupees which Malcolm put into the concern, he paidi all the expenses, while the remaining partners paid nothing.18 latter may pass out of his possession, and he may gradually lose the island. Finally, he points out that he did not give permission for the conclusion of agreements with foreigners, and that the lease agreement does not contain any clause under which the whole output could be delivered to one individual without his (Sakar’s) sanction. (Annexes 12, 16, 20, 22 of the first German Memorandum and Annex 39 of thif^P*' Memorandum). In the first place it is not easy to understand how the agreement of the 1st June, 1906, can be regarded as a letting of the mines to Mr. Wonckhaus. The stipulation that the oxide is to be delivered free on hoard, and the detailed arrangements concerning the quantity to be loaded daily, make it clear that Mr. Wonckhaus was not to have anything to do with the working of the mines themselves.'* The agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus is a simple contract for delivery, an entirely unobjectionable commercial transaction such as might take place anywhere without giving rise to comment, and which was intended to promote purely commercial interests. Even if this agreement had given to Mr. Wonckhaus for a certain time a position in the nature of a monopoly as regards the red oxide obtained on Abu Musa, that would not have prevented the transaction from being a perfectly legitimate one. It is to be observed, however, that a monopoly in the strict sense of the word was not established, since the company was at liberty to sell certain quantities to India. Sakar’s fear that the agreement may lead not only to the property in the mines being gradually lost to the owner—whether he is Salim or Sakar—but even to the separation of the Island of Abu Musa from Shargeh, is so senseless that it is really not worth while to discuss it. As regards Sakar’s objection to the conclusion of agreements with foreigners, it is to be observed that the lease agreement concluded between Salim and the company contains no provision against the sale of the produce of the mines to foreigners. On the contrary, in view of the freedom of trade recognised in the Persian Gulf, and the absence of an express prohibition in the lease agreement, it may be considered to be taken for granted that the company of lessees is to be at liberty to conclude arrange ments for supplying foreigners also. Moreover, in the Memorandum of Association, with which Sakar had been acquainted for years and which he had approved of, sales to foreigners were expressly provided for, and such sales were as a matter of fact repeatedly concluded, without any objection on Sakar’s part. His observation in his letter of the 26th March, 1907 (1 1 Safer, 1325, Annex 16 of first German Memo randum) : ( We did not tell you to make contracts with strangers from foreign Powers without informing us,” is therefore entirely groundless and misleading. It is also strange that, as appears from the letter just referred to, Sheikh Sakar should wish British subjects to be treated differently from those of other Powers. From, the point of view of the Shargeh State a British subject is certainly just as much a foreigner as is the subject of any other Power. Yet Sheikh Sakar has nothing to say against the company of lessees concluding agreements with British subjects, while agreements with other foreigners are not to be allowed. This is evidently contrary to the principle of the “open door.” In the^ view of the Imperial Government the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus neithei infringes the terms of Salim s concession, nor is in any way dangerous to the internal peace, external independence, or territorial integrity of Shargeh. It is there fore not apparent how the action of Sakar against the company could be justified by considerations connected with the welfare of the State. The conclusions arrived at above may be summarised as follows :— 1. Sheikh Salim is owner of the Island of Abu Musa, and therefore, according to the commercial law prevailing on the Persian Gulf, had a right to lease the oxide mines there to the mining company, Hassan-ibn-Ali and Co., in his own name. Accoiding to the Mohammedan religious law he could not conclude the lease agreement; accoiding to that law, however, the company would have acquired the exclusive right to the produce of the mines simply by the fact of working tbem. 2. The owner of the island, whoever he may be, has no authority, either according to the lease agreement (which is to be judged by commercial law), or according to religious law, to revoke or terminate the rights of the mining company or to hinder the company in any other way from working the mines. 3. Hassan Samaih had authority, as manager of the mining company, to conclude ihc British Memorandum observes that the arrangement between Sheikh Salim and the company was no rea y a lease agreement, but “ a permit to work these mines.” If even that arrangement is not to be considered a leasehold, it is incomprehensible how a simple contract for the delivery of an article can be regarded as a “ leasehold.”i? &gt;1 VJ agreements like that with Mr. Wonckhaus, signing in the name of the company, without consulting the other partners. Such agreements at once become binding on the other partners; in the case under consideration, however, their approval was also signified. 4. The agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus is advantageous to the mining company, so ^,hat the partners have not been injured by Hassan Samaih’s action as manager. 5. There was therefore no reason for a complaint of the company against Hassan Samaih on the ground of action contrary to agreement or duty. G. There was accordingly no ground for action on the part of Sheikh Sakar against Hassan Samaih for the protection of the other partners. Moreover, the seat of the company is at Lingah, and the partners of the company are not subjects of the Sheikh of Shargeh, so that he has no jurisdiction in matters concerning the relations of the partners with each other. In any case, be could not exercise such jurisdiction himself, but should have had the dispute settled by the judge. 7. The agreement between the mining company and Mr. Wonckhaus, which is nothing but the conclusion of an ordinary and permissible business transaction, and which cannot have any political aims, neither infringes the lease agreement nor is in any way dangerous to the interests of the State of Shargeh, so that the action taken by Sheikh Sakar against the company cannot be justified on the ground of the general interests of the administration of the country. 8. Sheikh Sakar’s interference is not limited to redressing a wrong alleged to have been done by one partner to the others, or to preventing the carrying out of an agree ment alleged to be contrary to the interests of the country, but simply deprives the whole company of the basis of its existence. The company, in which the German firm of Hobert Wonckhaus and Co. ha\e a share, is thereby very seriously injured, since the realisation of its object is made impossible and it is not in a position to carry out current obligations imposed upon it by contract. . 9. Sakar’s proceedings, then, are clearly a violation of law—an exercise of arbitrary power. The British Memorandum maintains that, as Hassan Samaih had no authority to conclude a contract for the delivery of oxide with Mr. Wonckhaus which would be binding on the company, it is open to Mr. Wbnckhaus to claim compensation from Hassan Samaih for non-fulfilment of the contract. There can, however, be no doubt, after what has been stated in the present Memorandum, that the responsibility for carrying out the contract for the supply of oxide rests, not with Hassan Samaih personally, but with the companv as a company. The fulfilment of the contract by the company has, however, up till now been prevented by the arbitrary act of Sheikh bakar, and the lawless state of things brought about by that act. ^ . . In consequence of the conclusion of this contract oy Mr. Wonckhaus, acting m t le interests of the firm of E. Wonckhaus and Co., this latter firm at the present time still has a substantial interest in the existence and prosperity of the mining company. When the disputes of the company with Sheikh Sakar placed the firm m a dilhcult position, it was only doing what was necessary in the defence of its legitimate interests when it endeavoured to 'acquire a share in the company, and so to exercise a direct influence on the fortunes of the latter. There was no reason why the illegal interference of the sheikh should prevent the firm from acting as it thought fit. The attempt is made in the British Memorandum to show that the firm ol Wonckhaus has no locus standi in this dispute, on Hie ground that it either acquired its share in ignorance of the position of affairs, in which case it must address its claim to the vendor, or else acted with knowledge of the position, and has consequently itself to blame for the injury it has sustained. This line of argument starts from the erroneous assumption that the lease agreement is no longer legally valid. If that were the case, there would doubtless be no foundation for the present complaint. But as the dispute turns upon the question whether the cancelling of the lease agree ment was legal or illegal, and as the Imperial Government, for the reasons stated m this Memorandum, are convinced of the illegality of the cancelling of the agreement, tSfrL^ ^“ngt^t sCe^quired by It in Xe company’ throughout to render the rights enjoyed by Mr. Wonckhaus under the agreement for the sunolv of oxide illusory for the benefit of his competitois. Sheikh Sakar compelled by force of arms the cessation of the working of the oxidemines. His proceedings are also an infraction of the “ Maritime Truce,” to the preserva tion of which in those regions His Majesty’s Government devote particular attention. His action was supported by Great Britain to the extent that the gun-boat “ Lapwing ” towed to Abu Musa the boats of Sheikh Sakar in which the sheikh’s armed men were brought to the island to stop the work by force and prevent the landing the employes of the firm of Wonckhaus.' :;: ' So that not only was Sakar’s attack on the rights of the mining company made with the knowledge of the officials of His Majesty’s Government, but it was also directly assisted by them. The Imperial Govern ment cannot, therefore, do otherwise than include His Majesty’s Government in the responsibility for the consequences of this attack. November 1909. Annexes.

S ALIM-IBN-SULTAN. 29 Shawal, 1315 (March 23, 1898). (L.S.) Annex 7. In the name of God ! I, the Sheikh Salim-ibn-Sultan, have leased all the red oxide mines existing on the island called Abu Musa to the two persons Alhadj Hassan-ibn-Ali-ibn-Samaih and his son Abdallah-ibn-Hassan Samaihfor a price the amount of which is 250 French reals for a full year. I bind myself towards the lessees to allow the lease of the red oxide mines to remain in their hands so long as they obtain red oxide from them. I allow them to work in the red oxide mines in the whole circumference of the island from (all) four sides. I bind myself towards them, so long as they work, to give them friendly assistance if they require it. I further bind myself towards the persons aforesaid that if they should wish to engage in transactions with traders on the island, or load shells or canary seed on it, they are to be allowed to do so ; they are not to be opposed, whether they ship it and dispatch it in boats or in ships; they are not to pay duties or rent or anything else with the exception of the rent fixed for the red oxide mines. If they wish to construct houses and wells, I authorise them to do so, but only for working and living; they are not to have rights of ownership. The lease which I have given them of the red oxide mines shall remain in their hands for the term of twenty years.

Your honoured letter has arrived and what you said has been understood, and that you have no money in hand at present. As soon as you get money you will pay 166 reals to Hussein Ali Shah ; you will, we hope, not be wanting in this regard. Also there came to us brother Abdallah-ibn-Hassan and Hadj Ali, and they concluded the matter of the mica with Sheikh Salim-ibn-Sultan for 400 reals. They drew on us for the money ; we paid it to Sheikh Salim. We have placed your share in account, and have deducted from it the share of [my] son Isa, so that your exact share is 337^ reals. Further, we have placed in account for you 80 reals as the equivalent of the 100 rupees which we gave brother Abdallah three years ago to buy us a gun with, and also 50 reals which we sent to Alhadj Ali Ahmed Salih at Abu Musa. We beg that you will note this. We hope that you will do your best in the working of the red oxide mines on Abu Musa. Brother Abdallah did well to reduce the numbers of the oxide workers, as the expenses were too high. As regards the price of the oxide which you sent to London, we hope you have obtained the money and devoted it to paying expenses. We hope that the ships sold their red oxide well. lurther, we have drawn up the detailed draft of a memorandum of association, and have given it to brother Abdallah to be placed before you. You should all sign it and then send us a copy : then all will be m order. Brother Abdallah informed Sheikh Salim of this instrument, the sheikh informed Sheikh Sakar, and Sakar said he would, like us to give him a copy of it. Wh told him we would give him a copy ourselves. We hope you will send back the document by return of post, and that you will do your best about the mica. And God bless you and preserve you from evil! Amen.

If it becomes necessary to provide money for the expenses of the mines, a sum I shall he fixed, with the knowledge of the partners, which they shall pay, or else they f.hall make other arrangements for continuing the working ot the mines. 3. If the partners consider it necessary in their interest to proceed with the purchase of articles for consumption by the miners, the matter shall be considered by all of them ; a sum of money equal to the price of the articles shall be fixed and taken into account, and when the articles are delivered to or sold to the workpeople, the profit shall go to the partners. 4. For each mine they shall render an account of the expenses incurred for the wages and maintenance of the workmen and the salary of the accountant from the date when its lease commences until the expiration of six months, and after that (time) they shall render an account every four months. 5. Any partner who, in the service of the mines, is on the spot for the purpose of supervision shall have his expenses paid so long as he is there, and the cost shall be apportioned to all out of the capital. 6. As regards the lighters which are necessary for the service of the mines, we have, from the beginning of the renting, employed four large and four small boats, which are at this moment in the service of the island; we have entered the prices of the said boats in our hooks and have duly informed the partners of the price of each by letter. 7. Every four months the amount of the produce of the mines, the amount shipped, and the amount in the hands of the company shall be ascertained. 8. Every four months the amount sold from the mines shall be ascertained, whether it is on the island or has been sent to agents elsewhere, and the expenses arising from freight charges, &amp;c., shall be deducted. 9. Every four months the accountant shall send the account to the partners who are not at the mines, in order that they may be informed of the position, and these accounts shall bear the signature of the partners who are at the mines.

To the honoured faithful friend, Mr. Hassan-ibn-Ali Samaih, God keep him well! After greeting and enquiring about your health (I inform you as follows):— Your friend is ill and not able to write himself, and asks you to excuse him. We have received your letters to us. Rashid’s bill of exchange has arrived and we hope to send it ; and as regards Sayid, we have made an arrangement. He gives us stuff in place of what we claim, for he has no money. Brother Abdallah and Sheikh Salim went to Abu Musa to conclude the desired lease of the minerals, and we gave them the copy of the contracts to take with them to sign there. We wanted to arrange the matter here, like the lease of the red oxide, but, because people raised doubts in his mind, he said he would only do it after seeing the place. It is to be hoped that they will settle this matter ; through the exertions of brother Abdallah all will go well. We have given Sheikh Salim an advance of 80 reals against his I.O.U., as well as 50 reals, the balance of the shell due ; he refused to start until we had made him an advance. I hope you have got more ships and shipped red oxide to India; it is to be hoped that our Lord (God) will grant good profits, in order that our friends may rejoice and the envious be annoyed. People are very envious of us in this matter. As regards ISir, a dispute has arisen between Sheikh Sakar and Salim. It is Sakar s intention to lease ' without mentioning Salim’s name, and to give some advantage to Salim, but Salim would not agree to this. We have so far deferred {the matter) until they come to some agreement, each has an instalment of two pieces of gold.

It follows therefrom that the ground landlord has no right to cancel this agreement, and that it is valid and fulfils all conditions. And if the said person wishes to raise an objection in regard to the duration of the lease, he has no right to do so, unless the lessee consents, for he w^as not compelled to conclude the agreement, but did so of his free will, and consented to it.

Explain it, and you will be rewarded and receive the heavenly reward. Opinion. The answer. We pray to Thee, O God, for guidance to arrive at the truth ! The lease mentioned in the document is null and void. The use of the mine referred to belongs to Alhaaj Hassan and the others, for it is one of the open mines which are no one’s free property and belong to no one in particular, and anyone who first comes to them takes what he requires out of them, even for purposes of trade. And he (the sheikh) has no right to give the mine to others, and the sheikh may not prevent Alhadj Hassan and his partners from extracting the red oxide referred to and giving it to others ; even the Imam is not at liberty to give open mines to anyone as a fief, for they are common property of the Moslems and others, like water and grass. Whoever first comes to open mines extracts*what he requires, and no one may interfere with him until he has got enough. The document is, therefore, null and void, and Sheikh Salim-ibn-Sultan has no right to the rent as against Alhadj Hassan and the others his partners, by God the Highest!

Explain it to us, and you will be rewarded and may God reward you for us ! ’ ana Opinion. The answer. O God (allow) justice to prevail and guide to truth ! The red oxide mine referred to belongs to the group of open mines, which do not by bemg worked acquire the character of property to be freely disposed of; no one can ahdly make such an open mine his private property to the exclusion of others, nor can the Mosl' d ^■ ' m i aS t fief T Pate ? t from the Sultan ; but ;t is common property of the Moslems, like drinking places for cattle, grass, and firewood.

And what you sent by the woman has arrived, God bless you and preserve you as a protection in misfortune, Amen !—Further : As regards the money for the hire of the boat, my son Isa had spoken to me about it before the arrival of your information and I intended to pay it; but when I learnt from the contents of your letter that the owner of the boat has money lying with you, I told my son Isa that if he were asked for the money he was to allow the matter to be made the subject of a lawsuit before us, and D.V. we shall do all we possibly can. Further, as regards Sayid Alban ram, I keep a look-out for him, but he has no business connections ; I never see anything of him, he lives entirely with his relations. That is the reason for my not having done anything; it is not from inattention. Further, we ask you to inform us about the result of the exertions of brother Abdallah-ibn-Hassan concerning the red oxide at Calcutta, and also about the second decision which you communicated, to us namely that you wanted to sell the red oxide from Abu Musa for a fixed price • so far we have not heard how the matter ended. If Abdallah has been engaged in lawsuits at Calcutta for the last four years, and has been making incredible exertions in this hope less matter, and his stay at Calcutta necessarily costs money, and he requires an income what is the use of this long stay, as nothing can be done with the red oxide? It would suiely be better for him to return and other arrangements to be made People cannot go on for years making all kinds of schemes and barren speculations. further, how about Ali Ahmed Salih’s share, now that he is dead? If the grantinq of the s are was conditional on his acting as overseer, the share of course lapses now that he has ceased to act, and becomes the property of the whole company. 1 hope you will be able to send me good news about the progress of my son Abdallah, after the unpleasant news I have had. Let us always hear that you are well, and remember me to all the sons and brothers, and greeting. My son Isa greets you. ABDALLATIF-IBN-ABDARRAHMAN.

Peace be with you, and the mercy of God and his blessings and kindest greetings! We have received your honoured former letter and the present one, and we were glad to hear that you were well and what you said in regard to the red oxide mines. Thank God you have sold to the German Wonckhaus, at 15s. per ton; the extraction of 2,000 tons annually is agreed upon; you have to bear all costs, and the price is net. Now it is to be hoped that all is ivell, and that there will be joy after sadness. Brother Abdallah will arrive in any case to superintend the work, for without him I don’t think the work can be done. But take care not to enter into an agreement which looks like a lease, or into an undertaking, leading to gossip and disputes, or even complaints and lawsuits. For you see, it is unpleasant to our rulers—they will not allow it. But thank God you are wise, and will not be negligent and careless, and allow yourself to be caught, for now- a-days everybody is setting traps to catch people in. I hope you will not be neglectful. The object (of the letter) is (to express) our pleasure at this news, if we are to be spared the annoyances of this life more than in the past. So much, and greeting ! ABDALLATIF-IBN-ABDARRAHMAN.

To the much honoured brother Alhadj Hassan-ibn-Ali Samaih, God keep him well! Peace be with you and the mercy of God and his blessings ! I have received your esteemed letter, and have understood what you said. We have read the copy of the agreement which you have concluded with the German regarding the sale of the red oxide at Abu Musa. My son Isa does not agree to the conclusion of an agreement in those terms, but you did not ask for his advice, nor did you consult with him, nor did you send him a copy of the agreement before the conclusion of the matter with the German regarding the red oxide, so that there is now an estrangement between you two. You commit yourself in a definite, clear manner, whereas the partners surelv may not commit themselves in a matter without ascertaining the views of the whole [2574 c- * Note of translator (Oriental): or this may mean “ from enemies.” -i]34 body, in order that difficulties may not arise. But you committed yourself in this matter without consultation. Therefore my son Isa does not agree to this contract which has been concluded between you and the German, for he apprehends difficulties from the participation of foreigners in this business. It is better to try to cancel the agreement than to do as he {the German) wishes. And you have been informed before this that an association with the German in the red oxide matter should not take place,I because it was to be feared that it would lead to unpleasant consequences. That is what my son Isa says. I have communicated it to you for your information, and greeting. ABDALLATIF. 8 Dulhidje, 1324 {January 23, 1907). Annex 37. The Arabian Mission, R. C. A. Mr. C. Eisenhut, Robert Wonckhaus and Co., Bussorah: My dear Mr. Eisenlmt, Bussorah, February 5, 1909. REPLYING to your communication of a few days since, in which you ask me to define an Arabic sentence, I wish to report as follows :— I. —JlkxL^ is the Masdar of the Xth conjugation of the root JLj. The verb Jk&gt; is an intransitive verb signifying to be repealed, to be abolished. The second conju- gation Jk, on the measure j*i makes the verb transitive, and the Masdar (German infinitivus) indicates nullification, abolition, repeal. The fourth measure Jkd (JjoI) likewise makes the intransitive verb transitive. It is the function of the Xth conjugation to impart to the Ilnd and IVth measures the significance of a desire to, an asking to, a seeking to, a considering, and occasionally imparts reflexive meaning. Vide Palmers Arabic Grammar, p. 31. Vide Socin’s Arabic Grammar (Berlin, 1895), p. 29, § 26. Cf. also &amp;c. Cf. also the standard Arabic dictionary “ Qatr-el-Muhit,” in loco. JlkCLs^ signifies “ a desire or request to nullify, or abolish.” II. &lt;L3jUUh (LhliLc, root Jli, to say, speak. Ihe form means a conference, a conversation, dispute, &amp;c. Then by derivation an agreement, but usually a verbal agreement. For “a written agreement” would be properly used, though there is locally in Bussorah some looseness in the use of this word. III. —yci-, from the root, ,U., meaning to be good, to be merciful. signifies better, preferable, with no implication of compulsion except that of a moral obligation. E.g., in the Moslem call to prayer at dawn : ^ ^ xfi. n \\ (“ prayer is better than sleep ”). E.g., (charity). E.g., &lt;0 (a charitable society). Cf. Matthew xviii : 8 Van Dyck’s version. Cf. Matthew xviii: 8 Jesuit version. IY.—lyjub*-b root The IVth measure signifies to respond, reply, implying no compulsion. signifies a favourable answer or reply, compliance with a request. Cf. Wortabet Dictionary, in loco. is wider than (acceptance), inasmuch as ma y35 mean acceptance or compliance per force, as, e.g., a man imprisoned accepts (JjJ) his fate, but a free man exercises ^when he accepts a favour, a gift, &amp;c. signifies acceptance with complete obedience, but also with assent, flu ^). Cf. “ Qatr-el-Muhit.” The obvious meaning of the sentence therefore is : The desire to nullify or repeal this (verbal] agreement is better than (preferable to) an assent thereto.” Respectfully submitted. Rev. JOHN van ESS, M.A., Chairman, Language Examination Committee, Arabian Mission. Annex 38. In the letter of Abdellatif to Hassan Samaih, of 8, Dulhidje, 1324 (23rd January, 1907), the following passage occurs :— ^ iLhliUb JlUlA (istibtal hadihi ’Imuqawale chair min idjabethu). The first word JlUlA does not appear in the dictionaries; but according to the analogy of such formations it can only be translated : “ the wish (or endeavour) to bring about an annulling ” (the annulling itself would be (tabtil) or JM (ibtal), see, e.g., Hava, Arabic-English Dictionary, Beirut, Catholic Press, 1899, p. 36 : Jk-U Jk&gt; to annul, to cancel [a deed] ”). The last word (idjabethu) can on account of the masculine pronoun hu, only refer to one of two preceding words : 1. “ My son Isa,” or the “he” in the subordinate clause referring to “my son Isa ” : “ for he apprehends difficulties from the participation of foreigners in this business.” 2. “ The German.” It cannot refer to Isa, because that would have no meaning. So that the hu in idjabethu can only refer to the German, and that makes sense; for (adjab) (with accusative of the person) signifies : “to answer someone, to agree with someone, to comply with the wish of someone.” The meaning of the sentence is therefore : “it is better to aim at the annulment of this agreement than to comply with his {the German s ) wishes.^ The opinion of the missionary van Ess on the passage agrees with mine in regard to JlkiuLsl (istibtal). He does not explain the word (idjabethu), but alters it to (idjabetha). The view that the wrong pronoun (masculine instead of feminine) is used here, as happens not unfrequently in these documents, and that it is justifiable to substitute the “right” pronoun, is erroneous, for the reason that after the verb (adjab),the accusative, which here appears as an affixed pronoun, can only denote a person, and not a thing; but if the word were (idjabetha), the reference would be to a thing, viz., the &lt;£JjUU (muqawale: “agreement”). The translation “an assent thereto ” is incorrect. Prof. Dr. MARTIN HARTMANN. Hermsdorff, near Berlin, November 20, 1909. [2574 c—1] L36 Annex 39.

From Asharidja to Lingah. 12 Safar, 1325 (27th March, 1907). To the honoured Alhadj Hassan-ibn-Ali Samaih, God the Highest keep him well! After greeting, &amp;c. (we inform you): We have received your honoured letter and noted its contents. When we received your communication to the effect that you had sold to the Germans 2,000 tons a-year of the red oxide of the Island of Abu Musa, the price of which was 15s. for each ton, we sent you the reply, dated 21 Rebi II, 1324 (14th June, 1906), from which (our) satisfaction appears, but which contains a warning against entering into an agreement which looks like a lease or into an undertaking leading to gossip, because our rulers will not allow anything of the kind, and we asked you to secure us against the Annoyances of this life. The letter must have reached you, and you must have understood its contents. After we had asked you several times to send us a copy of the agreement, you did so on the 5 Dulkade, 1324 (21st December, 1906) ; it was in English, and we acknowledged its receipt in our letter dated the 6 Dulkade, 1324 (22nd December, 1906) ; and when we had found a translator, and got the translation, we discovered that you had rushed into the very thing against which we had warned you, and that you have bound yourself by lease. Therefore (my) son Isa does not agree to this contract, which takes away all power of disposal and exploitation of the red oxide mines of Abu Musa. We have so informed you before this in a letter dated the 8 Dulhidj, 1324 (23rd January, 1907), at the time when the contents of the agreement became clear to (my) above-mentioned son. A perusal of the enclosed translation of the agreement will show you that the thing is not, as you previously wrote us, a matter of buying and selling, but a leasing business, against which we have warned you. Sheikh Sakur-ibn-Khalid does not agree to your leasing the red oxide to foreigners of a foreign Powei, and considers that the agreement was that they, the partners, were to work themselves, as you did a few years ago, and not that you should give a lease. This is what it was necessary to explain. We have informed you in order that you may know it and may act in such a way as to secure all from complications; and greeting. ABDALLATIF-IBN-ABDARRAHMAN. Annex 40. In the name of God the Highest ! To the much honoured faithful friend Alhadj Hassan-ibn-Ali Samaih, God the Highest keep him well. greeting, &amp;c. : Replying to your letter, in which were enclosed the papers of t e Memorandum of Association for the signature of the partners, and other papers for the information of the partners, regarding the extraction of red oxide and mica (we have to state that) : We have shown the letter to your partners, and their reply is (as follows) :— r j \ 1. You fixed the sum of 4,000 rupees as the price of the four large boats before you consulted them, and it is not clear to them whether the four boats have been employed from the date of the lease of the red oxide mines. r • \ re( ^ ox i de m i nes J the rent of which is 250 reals a-year, cannot bear the cost ot eight boats at high figures while the amount of oxide extracted is small. 3. It was not necessary to estimate so much for the workmen’s accountant and for food, &amp;c when such things surely do not disappear suddenly from the island. Also it is possible, by (good) arrangement, for the workmen to work 'for twenty days before the arrival of the ship, and it is possible for them to extract a great deal in that time ; other shippings should not be thought of till afterwards. To extract the red oxide from the ground and then leave it lying in the island is too expensive. It is now evident that s upping to India leads to loss of time. The people ask for samples; if they can get samples they give orders, but not otherwise. It is clear that the work was carried on37 v K &lt; ; assiduously without the existence of a demand ; only the expenses are evident, and God only knows what is the use of it! As regards the ship on which was dispatched the red oxide for the firm of Asfar, on whom you drew the bill, the partners do not know how the business ended ; apparently the expenses were not covered. Mines out of which so small a profit is made need not necessarily be worked with such assiduity. The reply of ^ the partners is therefore : for these red oxide mines four boats are sufficient—two to hold 100 sacks each and two 150. And as the place of shipping is near, each boat can load and unload four times a-dav, and the two boats that hold 100 sacks each can load and unload on the (different) sides of the island. Since the revenue from these mines is small they will not bear such heavy expenses. The partners count on getting a profit out of these mines, but if there are endless heavy expenses they cannot get rid of the idea that they are being asked to put their hands in their pockets and pay. In short, your placing eight boats in the service of the red oxide mines has not been accepted. This is the view of your partners ; and greeting !

God the Highest keep him well, protect him, and grant him a long life ! After enquiring about your precious health (we inform you) :— A letter to you has already been sent off by this post, and we informed you of what was necessary, but now we find that we have to write you this letter. We have received your letter of 23 Ramadan (14th January), and have taken note of what you have told us about your claim against Abdarrahman-ibn-Kazim. We are of opinion that you are in a position to sue him if you lodge a claim against him for that loss and damage. But we cannot put in the claim against him even if we are one of the partners. For the right to do so does not belong to each individual partner. We have not written him any letters so far, and nothing has occurred between us and him which would make it possible for us to do so. Now, if, for example, the Stnck company, which has partners, puts forward a claim against somebody, the right to put forward the claim does not belong to each of the partners, but only to some one particular person. If you hand in the claim at Lingah it may possibly be of use, and you may be able to get the damages and all costs from him. For the owner of the ship is the cause of the loss and damage, considering the instructions which you previously gave him. That is our opinion on the matter. Good health to you ! ARSHAM and TEKRAN MALCOLM. And as regards the shells on the rocky coast, 0 I have sent you some in order that you may know about it. I send you greetings and congratulations, and I am working hard to get your intentions carried out and to serve you. Written by Muhammed Hussein.

After inquiring as to your honoured health (we inform you): We wrote you a letter on the previous occasion and made the necessary communications to you, and we now inform you that we have received a telegram from Mr. Strick stating that he wants 500 to 700 tons of the red oxide of (the island of) Ibn' :i: ' Musa at the price of Is. 6d. per ton, to be delivered alongside of the ship, and he will pay you the price by bill on Bushire or in krans, on presentation of the bill of lading according to weight. The transaction is subject to the following conditions :— 1. The number of its (the oxide’s) quality must be the same as that of the red oxide (of the cargo) of the ship “ Sigrid,” or it may be superior, but not inferior. 2. You are bound from the time of the shipping of this red oxide for a period of six months not to sell red oxide to anyone in Europe or to ship it to Europe yourself; for the passage to Lingah twenty to twenty-five days from the date of shipping will be reckoned. Further, you are bound to guarantee that the quality is equal to that of the red oxide carried on the ship “ Sigrid,” and you likewise guarantee that during the period mentioned the red oxide will not be shipped to Europe by you or by anyone else ; but there will be no harm in your sending it to India or Calcutta. You are bound to accept or refuse the transaction, so please inform us by telegraph via Muscat or Jask; we inclose in this letter two draft telegrams—one of acceptance and one of refusal. If you accept we will negotiate further about the freight. Make sure of the weight, so that there may not be too little; you must ship the article fully up to weight and without flaw. We have to inform you further: If, during the six months period of delay fixed, Messrs. Strick wish to buy red oxide from you, you are bound to sell it for that price and on the conditions mentioned.
