TRUCIAL C OAST . 1. Sharjah. Reference paragraph No.189. Shaikh Sultan km oaqar. Ruler of^harjah, called on the Political Agent on the morning * of the 8th December, and informed him that after paying Sa’ud bin *Abdullah bin Jiluwi a visit of condolence, he had proceeded to Riyadh where he saw Bin Sa^d and the Heir Apparent in public. Shaikh Sultan received the following presents at Riyadh:- 1 V.8 Ford Car 14 Rifles 8 Pistols, and Cash and clothes. There is no reason as yet to suspect that there was any political object in this visit, though in view of the visits of Shaikh Sa’id bin Maktum of Dubai (see paragraphs No.147(a) and No.148(c) of Intelligence Report No.18 of 1935) and Shaikh Saltan bin Salim of Ras al Khaimah (see paragraphs No.157 and No.l59/2/iv of Intelligence Report No.19 of 1935) to the late Amir of Hasa, it naturally was of r-nsiderable interest. It seems to be generally accepted that the Chiefs arefc/ visiting Hasa and trying to visit Bin Sa’ud in the hope of getting some money and other presents and it is also certain that the late Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Jiluwi discouraged visits to Riyadh under orders of Bin Sa’ud. It is possible that Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar may have been allowed to go on to Riyadh because Sharjah is rather more Wahabi than the other places and Shaikh Saqar (father of the present Shaikh) was friendly with Bin sa’ud.&lt;r ID In any further communication on this subject, please quote ' N»- £7 6-SD isn q l and address—no^ to any person by nat^e, but to— , “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

Co far as negotiations here are concerned I should still much prefer adherence to this course biit it occurs to me that the recent trend of negotiations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq (see correspondence ending with blf your telegram No.17 to Bagdad) may make it desirable as a (n\^ matter of more general policy to reassert Ydthout delay the views of His Majesty's C-overnnent regarding the position between Ibn Baud and Persian Gulf rulers.

O November 16, 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 6548/269/91] Mr. Calvert to Sir Samuel Hoare.—{Received November 16.) (No. 292.) HIS Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State, and has the honour to transmit to him copy of a letter from Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, dated the 15th October, respecting the Qatar Oil Concession. Jedda. October 16. 1935. Enclosure. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to Mr. Calvert. My dear Mr. Calvert, Mecca, Rajab 17, 1354 {October 15, 1935). I HAVE received your letter dated the 26th September, 1935 (the 28th Jumad ath-Thani, 1354), and in reply I have the honour to state the following :— 2. It was strange to our Government that the British Government disapproved of the correspondence which has taken and is taking place direct between His Majesty the King and the Sheikh of Qatar, in respect of a matter concerning the affairs of Qatar, and that you relied on your disapproval upon article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, and stated that “ His Majesty King Abdul Aziz undertook, among other things, to maintain friendly relations with his Excellency the Sheikh of Qatar, between whom and His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment . . . .,” &amp;c., and whereas your statement and the interpretation of article 6 differ in text, meaning and significance from the contents of article 6, I therefore write to you herein the copy of article 6 literally, and which begins: “His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies undertakes to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of Koweit and Bahrein and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast, who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty’s Government.’’ The undertaking of His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies is confined to friendly and peaceful relations with the Amirs of those territories (literally : directions), and it does not contain any reference to any undertaking by His Majesty that he should not correspond with them or that they should not correspond with him, and therefore nothing has been changed since the Treaty of Jedda in the relations which had existed between His Majesty and those Amirs, but friendly and peaceful relations remained complete and perfect, and correspondence is exchanged between His Majesty and them in respect of various affairs, because this assures the friendly and peaceful relations which His Majesty undertook to maintain. The treaties referred to in article 6, concluded between the British Government and those Amirs, are the concern of the Amirs, and they (His Majesty’s Government) may bind them with them, but they (His Majesty’s Government) cannot bind our Government with them. 3. As regards your reference to (the fact) that the British Government, in accordance with their (willingness) to deprive themselves of their strict legal rights, and offer a part of those rights to the Saudi Arab Government, &amp;c. (literally : to the end of your statement on the subject), I am glad to draw your attention in this respect to the true facts that our Government always desire that their relations with the Amirs of those territories (literally : directions) should be lasting relations of affection and friendship, and do not desire to restrict (literally : press upon) them and their affairs, and they (Saudi Arab Govern ment) showed their readiness to grant them areas (territories) to the utmost extent [556 q—1]s-l k INDEXED any further communication on this subject, pleyte quote No. £(&gt;?£?/jp/tf, and address —not to any person by narne, but t&lt;A- “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1.

I found that Sheikh Hafiz had not clearly realised the position about the conceseion andfexplained to him, with the aid of a asp produced by Mr. %aca, that the conceo; ion was for a limited area which was ceacribed on a map attached to the concession# and that although in one place it extended slightly beyond the naximum frontier clei ed by Xing Abdul Aziz^it did not# in fact# extend to what we regarded ee the frontier between Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The limit of the concession in feet lay well to the North of the maximum line which we had been able to offer to King Abdul Aziz. There was no question of an unlimited 'blanket ’concession'# as in the ease of the Saudi concession to the Standard Oil Company of California, and in view of ourbown views on the frontier question there could be no question of the ucer ion extending over territory the sovereignty over which was in any real doubt. bheikh Hafiz did not discent from this explanation and did not pursue the matter further# but the conversation then turned on the question of the aouth-eoatern frontiers of Arabia as a whole. As t&gt;ir A. Ryan had by then almost certainly already made hi.G of:er to Xing Abdul Axiz I sew no reason for not giming an outline of it to the Minister# and I accordingly gave him a x'ougn exp an&amp;tion of the line which Sir A. Ryan had been authoris ed to propose. Sheikh Hafiz rather surprised me by appearing extremely oisappointed that we had not been able to offer eny further concession to King Ibn Saud in the neighbourhood of Khor el Ode id. I ex &gt;lained to him why this was impossible# and reminded/2 reminded him that I hnd made it absolutely clear, both to hiaeelf and to Fuad Bey, lost summer, why we could not agree to King Tbn Saud acquiring a new outlet to the eea betwe n Abu Lhebi and Qatar. I erapheeieedr however, that the whole of the Murra dirj^a fell within the territory which we were now prepared to recognise as under Saudi sovereignty, and that the line which Sir A. kyan had been authorised to offer the King approximated for a great part of its length very closely to the line claimed by the King himself. I tnink it ie as well that the Saudi Minister and Mr* f !ode should have had a fairly clear statement of the proposals which Sir A. Kyan will have made to the King» as the accounts which they will get from Arabia may well be slightly misleading. (Signed) 0 .?. None el.

The Sheikh sent a guarded reply and reported the matter to the Acting Political Resident, who went down and discussed the matter with the Sheikh. As a result it was proposed to instruct H.M. Charge d*Affaires at Jeddah to protest to Ibn Saud against his entering into direct correspondence with tne Sheikh of &lt;s»atar*M buJfc* Iam /fruy* 2. Meanwhile, the Saudi Government also raised the matter officially at Jeddah with H.M. Charge d'Affaires. It was accordingly decided to expand the communication to be made/2 made to Mr. Calvert on the lines given in Foreign Office telegram of 20th September, No. 112, at Yasin by Mr. Calvert in his letter of 26th September 18th October, now submitted, that Yusuf Yasin has reacted to the communication in the usual Saudi manner, y^11 u ai The Foreign Office have now instructed Mr. Calvert, in their telegram of 24th October, to close the matter for the present by saying that in any case it is hoped to settle the frontier question while Sir Andrew Kyan is at Riyadh, so that it is unnecessary for the present to discuss the matter further. 4. Probably, in the circumstances, this is the best solution. These discussions between Mr. Calvert and Yusuf Yasin appear never to lead anywhere and if the frontier question is, in fact, settled by Sir Andrew Ryan direct with Ibn Saud one may hope that no further difficulties of this sort are likely to arise between P.Z. 6774/35.

I received yesterday letter from Yusuf Yasin in reply to my letter dated September 26th, 'text of which following is summary sent by bag today. 2. Letter expresses surprise that His Majesty r s Govern ment should view direct correspondence with Sheikh of Qatar with disapproval, and in so doing should rely on Article VI of Treaty of Jeddah. Yusuf Yasin quotes phrase in my letter (paragraph 8 of your telegram) 'Ibn Saud undertook among other things to maintain friendly relations with Sheikh of Qatar” etc pointing out what he terms difference of text and significance to Article VI which he quotes in full. He asserts Article VI contains no reference to any undertaking by Ibn Saud not. to correspond with Sheikhs with whom relations since Treaty have remained on same friendly basis as before, with exchange of correspondence ensuring maintenance of those relations. Treaties referred to in article VI viz. those between His Majesty's Government and Sheikhs may be binding on latter but not on Saudi Government. 3. Regarding His Majesty's Government's prepar&amp;dness to offer concessions in derogation of their strict legal rights, letter declares Saudi Government's desire has always been for relations of friendship with Sheikhs; that they have no desire to exert pressure on them; and have shown readiness to concede territory to utmost limit on the understanding that whole of such2, ~ such domains were formerly subject to Ibn baud's forefathers. Saudi Government cannot recognise legal rights to which H^s ajesty’s Government now pretend and cannot accept them as a basis for discussion in regard to frontiers. Saudi Government therefore reserve their rights in territories and places which they cannot agree to renounce and in privileges granted in those places. 4. Saudi Government are fully prepared at any time to discuss settlement of question of frontiers animated by spirit of friendship for neighbouring Amirs.

WITH reference to my telegram No. J16 3 of the 8th September, relative to the question of the attitude of Saudi Arabia to Qatar, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith the translation of the personal letter received from Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, in which he states the view taken by the Saudi Arab Government of the grant of an oil concession in Qatar by the Sheikh of Qatar. The letter covers the main points mentioned by Sheikh Yusuf in his conversation with me on the 6th September, reported in my telegram No. 161 of the 7th September, except that no mention of the word “ protest ” is contained in the letter. In conversation, moreover, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin made some attempt to define the territories of the Sheikhdom of Qatar as having originally consisted of an enclave comprising Doha itself and a limited surrounding area known as Saffat. I refrained from following Sheikh Yusuf in an excursion into a subject on which I felt he was not expertly informed. 2. Copies of this despatch and enclosure are being sent to the Government of India, Bushire and Bahrein. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to Mr. Calvert. • (Translation,) Jedda, Jumad-ath-Thani 9, 1354. My dear Mr. Calvert, (September 7, 1935.) I DESIRE to confirm the verbal discussion between us when I spoke to you on the evening of the 8th Jumad-ath-Thani, 1354. You are aware that the frontiers between this Kingdom and the Amirate of Qatar and the coast of Oman have never been actually delimited between those countries, and our Government is ready to delimit this frontier at any time. It has come to the knowledge of our Government that the Amir of Qatar has granted or will grant a concession for the exploitation of oil in Qatar, but as the frontier has not been drawn between us and that Amirate therefore our Government beg that such a concession be not granted, and that no work be carried out in that zone before the frontier is definitely drawn. It is not possible for our Govern ment to recognise or agree to any work referred to being undertaken, and boring and production in the places which they (Saudi Arab Government) occupy and which is under their influence at the present time. I desire to explain to you that our Government, although they have granted a concession for the production of oil in the zone which includes the lands neighbouring on the Amirate of Qatar, but our Government, up to this date, have not allowed the company to operate any work of drilling in that zone, pending the definite delimitation of the frontier. With highest respects. YUSUF YASIN.

Your telegram No.112. 1 received yesterday letter from Yusuf Yasin in reply to my letter dated September 26th. Text of which following is summary sent by bag today. Letter expresses surprise that His Majesty's Govern ment should view direct correspondence with Sheikh of Qatar with disapproval, and in so doing should rely on Article VI of Treaty of Jeddah. Yusuf Yasin quotes phrase in my letter (paragraph 8 of your telegram) 'Ibn Saud undertook among other things to maintain friendly relations with Sheikh of Qatar” etc: pointing out what he terms diflerence of text and significance to Article VI which he quotes in full. He asserts Article VI contains no reference to any undertaking by Ibn Saud not to correspond with Sheikhs with whom relations since Treaty have remained on same friendly basis as before, with exchange of correspondence ensuring maintenance of those relations. Treaties referred to in article VI viz. those between His Majesty's Government and Sheikhs may be binding on latter but not on Saudi Government. 3. Regarding His majesty's Government's preparedness to * offer concessions in derogation of their strict legal rights, letter declares Saudi Government's desire has always been for relations of friendship with Sheikhs) that they have no desire to exert pressure on them; and have shov/n readiness to concede territory to utmost limit on the understanding that whole of such2. such domains v/ere formerly subject to Ibn baud f s forefathero* Saudi Government cannot recognise legal rights to which his ajesty's Government now pretend and cannot accept them as a basis for discussion in regard to frontiers. Saudi Government therefore reserve their rights in territories and places which they cannot agree to renounce and in privileges granted in those places. 4. Saudi Government are fully prepared at any time to discuss settlement of question of frontiers animated by srlrit of friendship for neighbouring Amirs.

By repeating to His Majesty’s Government his pretest against Qatar oil concession Ibn Baud makes it necessary to deal v/ith substance of his complaint. 2. In normal circumstances they v/ould have met this protest by a firm re-statement of their position regarding frontier question, especially as their attitude on this subject has already been clearly defined not only to Saudi Government but to United States Government and to United States oil interests who hold concession in Saudi territory. But in present delicate situation in Red Sea they desire to avoid driving Ibn Saud to turn towards the Italians for support which they would be only too ready to offer and v.hich he might accept - notwithstanding obvious dangers to himself - if he felt he were being hardly treated by His Majesty’s Government. 5o In these circumstances you may,subject to views of Government of India and of Political Resident, reply in writing to Yusuf Yasin to the following effect:- 4o His Majesty’s Government, when they learned of his letter, were about to address Saudi Government in regard to their action in corresponding direct with Sheikh of Qatar on a subject which, since His Majesty’s Government are responsible for the Sheikh’s foreign relations, falls within their sphere. You should*v 2 0 /-s should then make communication as instructed in paragraph 5 of my telegram No. 1 04 (of G ent ember 8 th) introducing a reference to note quoted in Sir A. Ryan f s telegram No. 3S (of February 21st). 5. You should then explain that after long negotiations, in which His kajesty's G-overnment participated and which they saw no reason to delay, the Sheikh of Qatar on May 17th last granted to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, with the full approval of His Majesty's Government, a concession for the exploitation of oil etc*, in his territory c As the Saudi Government have been informed, His Majesty's Government are prepared, in derogation of their strict legal rights, to offer to Saudi Arabia important concessions at the northern end of the frontier line, and to admit Saudi sovereignty up to the so-called !; Green Line' of which you should repeat the definition. But as was pointed out to Fuad Bey in London last June, this line repre sents the utmost concession which His Majesty's Government are able to offer in this area compatibly wich their obligations to the other rulers concerned. The reasons why His Majesty's Government are unable to contemplate further concession in this sector were fully explained to Fuad Bey. 6 0 The southern limit of the oil concession granted to Anglo-Iranian Oil Company by the Sheikh of Qatar not only does not extend beyond this Green Line, but lies to a considerable distance to the north cl it* The concession does not therefore extend to any territory under discussion with the Saudi Governments 7o Moreover His Majesty's Government have formally assured the Sheikh of Qatar of their protection against any interference with his territorial rights - more particularly over the area covered by the concession. In view of the language of Jbn Saud's5. Sand’s letter to the Sheikh of Qatar, His Majesty’s G-overnnient must make this point clear and draw the Saudi Government’s attention to the terms of Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda by which Ibn Saud undertook, inter alia, to maintain friendly relations with the Sheikh of Qatar, whose special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government he specifically recognises. 80 In these circumstances the frontier question cannot he affected by the grant or exploitation of this concession,. For your own information grant of a concession could not in any case prejudice the legal rights of either party over the territory to which it purports to extend. 9. fou should add that His Majesty’s Government appreci and reciprocate the Saudi Government's desire to reach an early agreement on the frontier question and that they hope that discussions on this subject may be profitably resumed on Sir A„ Ryan’s return to Arabia.

Ruler of ^atar. Mulhaq was unsealed and attached to formal sealed letter No:99/i/30 of same date* After Compliments, You doubtless know that I consider you to be like myself and I would therefore like to explain everything to you. In things which concern us and are between us and you, as you know, no change will take place. But in view of the political situation and of our interests, 0 f Brother, you should assist us. There is an important matter which concerns us. You know that the British interfered in the affairs of fOman and of Qatar and they have only two claims. One we have admitted, for the strong reason that the people of those parts have become under them and that they (the British) fight for them. Formerly we informed them(i.e. the British) that they(i.e. T 0man and Qatar) were our subjects and the subjects of our fathers and grandfathers(i.e. forefathers). In view of the fact, however, that the people of those countries have them selves chosen to be in their present state and whereas the English are our friends, we did not like to make obstacles and so we left the question of the towns only, but no one has the right to claim anything or property in the desert or among the tribes, nor had their fathers or grandfathers claimed such a right. We do not, however, want to press our brothers and relatives for the reason that they are brothers and relatives to us and so we do not want to deny any person a thing for which he is responsible and which he can protect. But other /other things which are beyond his control and in which he has no interests, we cannot allow them to pass to any person. The second matter is that they claim to have had a treaty with the Turks and that the Turks allowed them some lands. We informed them about three matters. Firstly, that the Turks did not exercise authority in these lands but that all were beyond their control, and that they did not keep order in Hasa and its vicinity nor did they have proper control over them. Secondly, tnat their alleged treaty with the Turks was signed only after I occupied Hasa. Thirdly, that the treaty was not ratified so that I do not admit nor accept it. The object and haste are, however, that we have heard tnat an oil Company have applied to you for a concession and. that they want to try operations and drilling, which would be of harm to us before the boundaries between us and you are fixed and before a treaty is concluded. Once the boundaries are fixed, you will be at liberty to do yourself what you like. As regards the boundary we will not go beyond the understanding between us. Your brother(i.e. Bin Sa f ud) requests you to adopt either of these two ways: that you should keep the matter until the question of the boundary between us and the British is settled when everything will be easy, or that you should request them(the British) to settle the question of the boundary between us and them by leaving the matter to be settled between us and you without their mediation, or between us and them, whichever way you may select.I have explained this to you, our brother, in order that you may be aware that if the Company starts any work or drilling before the boundaries are settled, we will be compelled to protest and to stop operations and to prevent anything being done until the matters between us and them are settled. If the drilling were to take place at some other place I would have done all in my power(Mot quite clear- but appears to mean that Bin Sa T ud would have taken action himself to stop them), as they have no right to drill before the settlement of the boundary between us and them. Yfe did not want to write anything to them before referring the matter to you, so that you should try and get the boundaries settled, which is our desire and would be better for you and for us, or to postpone the matter until the question is settled in the manner you consider fit. The reason for this(letter) is to inform you so that you be aware. You know that I am sure that, if it was the question of Qatar and of drilling in Qatar, you would not agree to anything from which harm should happen to us, but if we were to leave the matter it would be used against us as a proof by others. The arrangements between us and you will not be changed word by/or a span of land, if God is willing*« • gift te a frontiers which may possibly cause trouble. About three weeks ago Ibn Saud sent a letter to the Sheikh of Satar the contents of which are summarised in the Resident’s telegram of the 29th August, P.Z.6087/ 3£. The gist of it was that the Sheikh should not grant an oil concession until the boundary question had oeen settled. The Sheikh sent a guarded reply and reported the matter to~~the Political Resident. As a result of consultation w r ith Colonel Fowle, and subsequently with the Foreign Office, a, telegram was sent to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Jedda, on the 8 th September, instructing him, subject to the concurrence of the Political Resident and the Government of India, to put in a formal protest to Ibn Saud against his having indulged in direct correspondence with the Sheikh of Qatar. It was agreed that it would be better not to touch on the question of the subject matter of the latter at this stage. The Resident concurred and so did the Government of India who in their telegram of the 10th September make their position clesr on the matter as a whole. Meanwhile the Saudi2. Government have also taken the matter up with Mr. Calvert at Jedda (Jedda telegrams of 7th and 8th September, P.Z.6369 and 6389). This demarche makes it necessary not only to protest against the fact of direct correspondence, but also to deal with the subject matter. The Foreign Office have produced alternative draft telegrams to Jedda as a basis for discussion at a meeting between the Eastern Department, the Air Ministry and this Department, with Sir A.Ryan and Colonel Fowle present, this afternoon at 3.30./?' m - I have discussed the matter with Colonel Fowle and we agree that the Foreign Office draft A is on the right general lines, except that we would propose if possible to get it stiffened by the insertion of a definite statement that H.M.G. have promised the Sheikh protection of his territory. This, of course, we did h in connection with the Qatar oil concession (see P.Z.3414/35 below). It seems desirable that Ibn Saud, who is officially aware of our special relations with the various Sheikhdoms, should be told of this pledge which we have given to the Sheikh of Qatar. Some addition will also have to be made to the draft of course in view of the fact that presumably Mr.Calvert has not yet made any protest about the direct correspondence3. which protest will have to 'be linked up with the statement of the facts as regards an oil concession. I hope I may take it that you would approve^our ft tetiuo 4*1*) fai* it' proceeding generally on these lines. I figure our exposition quite clear to Ibn Saud at this stage ^ ^ t T 0 Ub 1 6 . If, * however, we leave him in doubt as to how far we support the Sheikh it might encourage him to stir up trouble among the tribes (which apparently, according to Solonel Loch’s telegram of the 30th August, P.Z.6116/35 is what the Sheikh fears.). k* yitdi fy- &lt;**&lt;* k*** jrlX &amp; (rU J ^FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l 11th September, 1935 Dear Clauson, As I promised over the telephone, I now enclose copies of two alternative draft telegrams on the subject of Ihn Saud’s complaint against the Qatar oil concession, which may perhaps serve as a 'basis Of diSCUSSion Wh^» nn Fr»irJnv 2.

X Addressed to Seoretary of State for India, repeated to Government of India and Jeddah (? 471) by air to Political Agent, Bahrein, at Karachi. Letter consists of formal sealed letter of greetings and unsealed postscript. It appears possible from style of language of postonpt that it may have been dictated by tne King himself. Following is the gist and extracts of important passages B egins . i. Bin Saud writes that there is an important matter in »hioh Sheikh should assist him. Sheikh knows that British have interfered in affairs of Oman and Katr in two ways. (? ii) Sirst Bin Saud had informed British that Oman and Katr were Ms subjects and subjects of hie forefathers (oompare anoestral claims correspondence, Fowle’s letter No.594(? 8), June 28th 1934). But,as the people of those countries were looked after by the British and chose to be in their present state and.as the British were his friends, he had not pressed that view' so we left the question of towns only, but no one (ig £Si no Trucial Chief) has any right to claim anything or property in the desert or amongst tribes, nor had anyone's father or grand-father claimed such a right’’. Bin Saud does not/- 2 - not wieh to deny to anyone anything for which he ie responsible, ^bich he can protect but 'things which are beyond his control and in which he has no interests, we cannot allow them to pass to any other person*.

Received 1.10 a.nu, 30th August, 1935. X T/193. Second and last part . Hi. Secondly, British claim to have hed a treaty with the Turks and the Turks allowed them some lands. Bin Saud has informed the British: (a) that the Turks did not exercise authority or control in those landa nor dad they keep order in Hasa or ii&amp; vicinity; (bi that the alleged treaty was signed only after he had occupied Hasa; and (c) that it was not ratified, ao that h© does not recognise it. i?. The object and urgency of his letter are that he has heard that an oil company have applied to the Sheikh for concession* Once the boundary is fixed the Sheikh will be at. lioerty to do what hg likes* Bin Saud requests the Sheikh to postpone the matter till the boundary between him and the British is aattisd or to ask British either (a) t .0 let nim and the Sheikh settle the boundary without their mediation; or (b) to settla the boundary with him Bin Baud themselves. 'I have explained this to you,our brother,in order that you may be aware that if the oompany starts any work or drilling before the boundaries are settled, we will be compelled to protest and to stop/( 2 ) stop operations and forbid anything being dene until matter(? s) between us and them are settled** Tc in two places there is reference to understanding between him and the Sheikh apparently over the boundaries, but the Sheikh denies having committed himself * 2o Sneikh states that he replied that anything lo &amp;&amp; wit;;, the Turkish treaty was matter for the British and that Katr boundaries are well known, and that he has already granted a . concession and cannot go back on it 0 3* Conraent follows*(COPIES CIRCULATED) -s q p t V./ I | I ■ Z) (43 groupie) ..

The letter demanded that the Ruler of Qatar should agree to fix the boundary between Qatar and Saudi Arabia; otherwise, Ibn Saud would be 'compelled to protest and to stop operations'. The suggestion of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (on folio 86) was that the means of preventing operations would be by fomenting tribal unrest. The papers discuss the British response to the letter, which resulted in a formal protest by His Majesty's Chargé d'Affaires, Jedda (Albert Spencer Calvert). The Foreign Office subsequently decided to close the matter until a settlement of the frontier question could take place.The papers include the text of Ibn Saud's letter or 'Mulhaq' (in Arabic, with English translation, folios 58-62); and correspondence from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Foreign Office, His Majesty's Chargé d'Affaires, Jedda, and the Government of India; and India Office minutes.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
