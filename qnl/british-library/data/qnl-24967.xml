In the case of air mails from the U.K, for Koweit, conveyance as far as Basra is provided by a British air service, viz.

The Superintendent, however, has informed our Kuwait Management that it is hoped that when the G.P. 0. takes over in April this year, separate airmail bags will be made up for direct despatch to London and any hold-up at Cairo thus eliminated. This arrange ment, coupled with the adoption of our suggestion for the use of our aircraft for the carriage of our ainnail between Kuwait and Basra, should do much to improve matters. has been considering irrproving deliveries of sea mail by arranging for such mail to be carried by Strick steamers sailing direct between the Gulf and the U.K. This seems to me to be an excellent idea and I hope that it will be possible to pursue it.

We have asked the Political Resident whether he sees any objection to the proposals in paragraphs 5 and 6 of your letter, keanwhile we have had a letter from the Koweit Oil Go. dated 4th February^ of which a copy is enclosed^ in which they ask whether there would be ary objection to arrangements being made for the carriage of air mair=L by their^own‘company 1 s / aircraft between Koweit and Basra and- air mail to and from the company at Koweit. 3. This of course ties up with the proposals in your letter of 31st January. It appears from the last sentence of paragraph 2 of that letter that air mails from the U.K. for Koweit are / alreadyn already carried on the Iraqi ^irways Service from Basra. We are not certain/upon what basis this has been arranged and by whom, nor whether it operates in the reverse direction, nor whether it applies to air mail fron- the United States (a large proportion of the howeit Oil Go. 1 s employees are Americans), to howerbi The delays in Basra mentioned by the Company . are presumably the fault of the Iraq postal administration and there j/fy room for improvement here in any case. 4* We should be glad to have any comments you may feel able to offer at the present stage on the howeit Oil Co.*s letter of 4th February.

HARRISONr 3S 'ib * From C A R Southwell Tel: Paddington 14-5 3/9 1450 ) 1 Great Cumberland Place, London, W 1. 4-th February 1948* We are anxious to tty and-retiEcoe the delay on the delivery of our airmail between Kuwait and the U.K. So far an we have been able to ascertain, this delay usually takes place at Basra. We had hoped that B.O.A.C. would agree to calls at Kuwait by their bi-weekly flying-boat service to the G-ulf and that a direct airmail link between the U.K. and Kuwait would thus be established. We still very much hope that this proposal will be adopted, but an we have heard nothing more on the subject, and as it may, in any case, be some time before B.O.A.C. can make the necessary arrangements to land at Kuwait, we have been considering alternative methods of improving the present airmail arrangements. now makes very frequent trips to and from Basra and it is likely that a considerable improvement in the speed of delivery of airmail could be effected if we were to use this aircraft for the carriage of our airmail between these two places. We feel that it should not be difficult to work out arrangements satisfactory to the postal authorities concerned for the franking of airmail letters and packages at Kuwait, their enclosure in separate bags, their delivery to the pilot of the aircraft and by him to the postal authorities at Basra, and similarly for the collection at Basra of our airmail for Kuwait. I should be grateful, therefore, if you would let me know whether you can secure the agreement of the Persian Gulf One of the Company’s aircraft stationed at Kuwait ^ nvFrom C.A.R Southwell Tel: Paddington 14-5 3/9 1 Great Cumberland Place, London, W. 1. 14-50 and ^aq postal administrations to this arrangement. The existing contract for the overland carriage of airmail between Basra and Kuwait would presumably remain unaffected as there would be no loss of revenue to the Kuwait Post Office. I should make it clear that this suggestion concerns the Company’s airmail only and that restrictions of space and weight would preclude our aircraft from undertaking any general responsibility for the carriage of airmail.

E.C.I. 3f January, 1948* &amp; Will you kindly refer to your letter of t he l6th October , / last toJRatcliffe Cousins, enclosing a copy of a report from • the Political Resident, Persian Culf, about the introduction C&lt;?1 an air mail service for Koweit. We have not seen a copy of any reply from Ratcliffe Cousins and I presume that no decision has so far been taken on the question of making Koweit a call on the '.O.A.C. air services, but in any event we must now make plans for the disposal of air mail correspondence from Koweit after the 1st of April- when we are due to take over responsibility from the Indian Post Office. In pursuance of our general policy in regard to air mail services we should wish to make the best use of such air services as are available, and while we prefer to use British air services if at' all possible, we should, in the absence of a suitable British air service, have no hesitation in using a foreign one. Indeed air mails from the United Kingdom for Koweit are already carried on the Iraqi Airways service from Basra. Normally, air services which convey mails operate for the purpose as agents of a particular postal adminisoracion ^usually the postal administration of the country to which the air service belongs) which collects the appropriate mail conveyance charges /from E.P.Donaldson, Esq.from other administrations whose mails are carried* These conveyance charges are notified by the responsible postal administration to other Administrations through the medium of the International Bureau of the Universal Postal Union and are expressed in gold francs per kilogramme* The postal administration of Iraq has notified in this way the availability of the Iraqi Airways service for the conveyance of other administrations' mails from Iraq to Koweit at the conveyance rate of 3 gold francs per kilogramme which, however, cove/s conveyance over the sector Baghdad - Koweit, and we assume, although this has yet to be confirmed, that the service in the reverse direction is similarly under the control of the Iraq Postal administration. In these circumstances there could be no question of a direct contract with Iraqi Airways for the conveyance of mails from-Koweit, ani the offer of Iraqi Airways to carry mails other than as agents for the postal administration of Iraq is not understood. f- It appears to us that the proper course would be for us to ask the' Iraq Postal Administration to confirm that the service is available for the conveyance of air mails from Koweit to Basra and to ask them to quote the conveyance /chargeTelephone: HEADQUARTERS 1234 Telegrams: Postgen Cent London Your Refer'' e POSTAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT, GENERAL POST OFFICE, P.O. Refet ;e LONDON, E.C.I. charge. When this information has been obtainedjthe mails would simply be handed to Iraqi Airways for conveyance, and it would be left to the Iraqi Postal Administration to claim the charges fran the British Postal Administration at the rate quoted, on the basis of the weights of the individual mails, details of which would be given on the documents handed over with the mails and reported to the parent Postal Authorities by the Company. If and when provision is made for the conveyance of air mails by air from Koweit to Basra, the surface mails should be sent by ship and the contract with the Koweit Zubair Transport Co. should be terminated. We should of course advise the Iraq postal administration of our intention to terminate this contract in order that they make their own arrangements for the conveyance of mails by sea from Basra to Koweit. We could advise them of this when making the enquiry about air conveyance suggested in the preceding paragraph. /■ Would you kindly let me have your views.
