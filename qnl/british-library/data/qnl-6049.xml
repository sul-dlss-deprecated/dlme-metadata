From — Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a letter received from the Political Agent, Kuwait, giving cover to a letter No. 459, dated 13th November 1912. iT0I P- Shaikh Sir Mubarak bin Subah, in which the latter begs that Government will be pleased to assist him in furnishing the Town of Kuwait with an adequate Water Supply. 2. Captain Shakespear mentions that he has been told by a British Engineer in Busrah, who has visited the locality, that the prospects of obtaining water by sinking artesian wells is not unsatisfactory and he suggests the deputation by the Government of India of a Geological expert, with experience of artesian wells, to examine and report on the prospects before further action is taken. 3. On reference to my records, I find that Mr. G. E. Pilgrim, who was deputed by the Government of India in 1905, to report on the Geology of the Gulf generally, did not visit Kuwait, and in his Memorandum on the Water Supply of the Persian Gulf, in connection with the establishment of a Quarantine Station at Hormuz, Director, Geological Survey of India letter , makes UO mention at all of Kuwait, No. 925, dated 2nd March 1906, received under whilst his fuller report on the Geology of the Foreign Department endorsement No. 1797-E.B., Persian Gulf only refers to Kuwait inciden- dated 2nd May 1906.

(Asiatic Turkey and Arabia—Confidential Print 41818, October 7th.) 4. The visit of an expert Geologist to Kuwait is, moreover, very desirable on other grounds. I have already suggested to Government the expediency of obtaining from the Resident to Foreign, No. M.- 170 , dated 13th Shaikh of Kuwait an option or concession June 1912. for minerals in Kuwait territorv, in which Foreign to Resident, No. 365, dated 22nd June the oil deposits which are known to exist there would be included. The Government of India did not then consider the moment opportune for action in this direction, but in view of the active measures now being taken by a group composed of the Deutsche Bank, the National Bank of India and the Shell Transport Company to obtain a concession from the Porte with a view to exploring the Oil Deposits of Mesopotamia, and other parts of Turkish Empire, it seems that we may be constrained before long to approach the Shaikh with a view to obtaining prior rights within his territory and preventing any attempt on the part of the Porte to include the Kuwait Oil Fields within any concession which it may grant. In this connection I would beg reference to the marginally cited letter of which the Government of India have, no doubt, re ceived a copy, in which the Director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company urges the im portance, on Imperial grounds, of the re tention of the Oil Fields in the Persian Gulf region under exclusively British control. The present opportunity for effecting a careful examination of the Oil Fields of Kuwait territory by an expert geologist, whilst nominally examining the potentiali ties of artesian wells in this region, is a most favourable one and not likelv to recur, and both on this ground, and with a view to doing our best to meet Mubarak’s wishes in the matter, I beg that Government will be pleased to give the question their benevolent and favourable consideration. Mr. Greenway to Mr. Maxwell, dated 21st October 1912, enclosing notes for evidence to be given before Royal Commission on Oil Sup ply. (Persia—Confidential Print 44428, dated 21st October 1912.) 5. In regard to the expediency of co-operation with Shaikh Mubarak, I would observe that, in dealing in regard to such matters wdth the somewhat unbusiness like Arab potentates of the Gulf, it is always of importance to take them while they are in the mood and to strike while the iron is hot. In the present instance, the2 Shaikh’s unreserved request to us is not only a very satisfactory sign of his confi dence, but, incidentally, the establishment of a scheme for Water Supply under Brit ish management would constitute a most convenient sign and considerable enhance ment of our predominant position at Kuwait. I, therefore, venture to hope that Government will be pleased to treat the matter urgently and to authorise me by telegraph to inform the Shaikh that they are primd-facie glad to meet his wishes, but before arriving at any definite proposal or decision they propose to depute a Geologist, as soon as it can be arranged, to examine the question on the spot and to give him and themselves expert advice as to the best means of effecting the object in view. The season is favourable now, and, if it is decided to co-operate in this way, the sooner the Geologist could arrive the better. He need not be absent more than a month from date of leaving Karachi or Bombay. No. 459, dated Kuwait, the 13th November 1912. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, LA., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to enclose herewith a letter in original from Shaikh Sir Mubarak-as-Subah, K.C.I.E., to your address together with a translation from which it will be apparent that the Shaikh begs the assistance of Government in furnishing the town of Kuwait with an adequate water-supply. 2. The supply of water to this town has become a very serious matter in its development, and I will, therefore, endeavour to explain how the present necessity has arisen. The town used to be supplied from wells on its outskirts, all more or less brackish and shallow, giving what was really only the scanty percolation of each season’s rain water. When the rainfall was slight, numbers of these wells gave out while the remainder became still more brackish as they were deepened. In 1908, owing partly to the failure of the rains during the winter of 1907-08 and partly to the bad pearl season of 1907, reducing the pearling fraternity to poverty, it oc curred to some dhow-owners to employ their vessels in the off-season by carrying water from the Shatt-al-Arab. The idea at once commended itself to owners, who were thus able to employ their vessels to some profit in the off-season and to boatmen and divers, who are at the same time ordinarily without employment and could thus earn a living. It was found that water so brought could be sold cheaply and yet return a sufficient profit so that within a year there were at least 20 native craft engaged solely in this trade. Consequently the donkey-owners, who formerly brought water in skins from neighbouring wells, finding themselves hard put to it for a living, sold off their animals and took to other trades. 3. As the town’s population increased and the advantages of good water from the Shatt-al-Arab came to be more appreciated, the number of boats employed rose until in 1910 there must have been at least 40 to 50 large boats alone, specially fitted with tanks for the trade and carrying from 3,000 to 5,000 gallons a trip, each vessel taking at least one trip every 4 to 6 days. By this time the town had become so dependent on the water brought by these boats that a severe storm, lasting only three days and preventing the boats from putting to sea, would cause a water-famine. Serious shortage of water began to be felt during the summer of 1911 when, owing to the previous good pearling season having stimulated the demand for divers, the water-boats experienced difficulty in obtaining crews. At the same time the population of the town continued to increase rapidly as trade recovered in sympathy with improvement of the pearl-market, and during the last two years there has been in consequence a large influx of Persians of the artisan and labouring classes, who have taken up a more or less permanent residence in Kuwait. 4. During the past summer (1912) the shortage of water was much more severely felt than formerly, though approximately the same number of water-boats continued to ply. This was the case when the town’s population is at its lowest owing to the absence of the pearling dhows with their crews ; on the return of the pearling fleet at the beginning of the cold weather the shortage became even more acute, and it has now become chronic. During the 3J years I have been in Kuwait the growth of the town in population has been very noticeable, several new bazaars have been opened and all are thronged, a large number of new boats have been added to the pearling-fleet, most of whose crews have to find dwellings in thetown, the demand for buildings has increased to such an extent that masons’, carpenters’ and coolies’ wages have nearly doubled as has also the cost of materials, such as bricks, stone, “ juss,” rafters and other wood. The shortage of water has been so severe that some of the old wells have been re-opened and the brackish water from them sold not infrequently at the rate of $ 1 (Re. 1-8) or more for two skins, containing together not more than 20 gallons. 5. To meet the water difficulty, and probably with an eye to profit himself, the Shaikh ordered from England a water-tank steamer of 300 tons capacity. The vessel has not yet arrived though expected shortly, but as 300 tons represents some 18,000 kerosine tins (the universal water measure) it will be seen that with only one trip in three or four days, which is the utmost she can attempt, her pre sence will not go far towards alleviating the present difficulty, even assuming her to work regularly without delays or break down. Moreover, the difficulty tends to increase rapidly owing to the steady increase of population and the fact that many of the poorer classes, who once drank brackish water “ faute de mieux,” having now become accustomed to sweet river water no longer consider potable that with which they were formerly satisfied. Further, there are indications that the trr.de of the town is attracting to it merchants and others of the better class from Turkish Arabia and Persia, a fact which tends to raise the standard of comfort and so produce an ever-growing demand for a plentiful supply of good water. I trust that the above paragraphs have made it clear that there is at the moment a really urgent need for a good water-supply and that any method contemplated must take into account a far larger demand in the near future than is at present apparent. 6. I will now turn to the Shaikh’s requirements. The subject has frequently come up in conversation with him, and I have discussed the relative merits and possibilities, so far as I was able to as a layman, of a large condensing plant utilis ing sea-water, such as I believe is installed at Aden, and of artesian well-borings. These are the alternatives the Shaikh contemplates in his letter, for no other system of water-supply seems possible in a sandy flat waste which could not become a catchment area even if the uncertain rainfall of some 6 to 9 inches per annum could suffice to provide an adequate amount of water. 7. The Shaikh having heard of the condensing plant at Aden is inclined to favour that particular method. The main objections to a large condensing plant (it would have to supply the wants of a town whose population is at present esti mated at between 40,000 and 50,000 souls) are, however {a) Heavy initial cost in buildings, machinery, etc. (b) Heavy recurring cost of fuel, whether coal or oil; an oil-fuel plant would appear to be the more economical, if suitable fuel at a cheap rate became available from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Abadan. (c) The maintenance of and the high cost in wages of the necessary com petently trained staff, which would have to be imported, for local labour would be difficult to train beyond the grade of fireman. (d) It is a question whether the pure water produced by a condensing plant could be sold cheaply enough to make its use universal. At present Shatt-al-Arab river water is sold at annas 1| for a kerosine-tin full (4 gallons) plus carriage to house. 8 If artesian well-borings can find water in the vicinity of the town, most of the above objections seem likely to disappear ipso facto. I do not know whether the geological formation near Kuwait is favourable or otherwise to the project but the existence of fresh-water springs under the sea at various places along the coast, and the absence of any running water on the land-surface draining the flat deserts of the west and south would argue that there must be water-bear ing strata below that from which the existing shallow surface-wells draw their meagre supplies. Some conversation which I had with a Mr. Shaw, who has estab lished himself at Basrah as a consulting Engineer, has led me to think that pro- bablv Artesian wells would offer the cheapest and most satisfactory method of supplying Kuwait with water. Mr. Shaw, who is a British subject, trained in America, where he had some experience in Artesian well-boring, gave me to under stand that a 4-inch well properly cased, with all the drilling machinery, etc., would cost for 400 to 500 feet depth some £500 for the first bore, subsequent bores of course being much cheaper as the drilling plant would be available for them. 14 understand that the Government of Bombay have sunk many artesian wells in various districts of the Presidency, and perhaps some reliable information and expert opinion could be obtained from it. 9. It will be seen from the Shaikh’s letter that he is quite agreeable to the wdiole work being carried out by Government as a Government concern, with its own officers to remain indefinitely in charge and the enterprise to continue in Government’s hands. In this case he would fix a regular rate, calculated to make the plant self-supporting, at which the water would be sold, profit or loss owing to fluctuating demand falling on Government. On the score of efficiency there is no doubt that some such arrangement would be an advantage, particularly if a condensing plant is decided upon. The Shaikh is equally agreeable to the work being executed by Government or by contractors under Government supervision on his behalf, and being then handed over to him at its cost price ; all he asks in that case is that he may be permitted to pay the bill by suitable instalments. 10. The point which the Shaikh’s letter does not make very clear is the urgent necessity for the work, for I know that he contemplates it being possible to have a water-supply by one of the methods suggested in full working order by next April or May ; and it is true that, when the pearl-boats leave for next year’s season, this town will suffer to a degree not experienced hitherto from the want of water. Further, the Shaikh is convinced that he must make some adequate arrangement for a proper water-supply at once, he does not care at what cost as the necessity is so great, and he can see no way out of the difficulty without the assistance of Government. He therefore leaves it entirely to us to make what arrangements ■we think best for a permanent supply, knowing that he can make no suggestions in so technical a matter which are likely to be of any use. 11. I would solicit, therefore, your earnest support towards assisting the Shaikh in this matter in which he has shown so enlightened a public spirit, and particularly in order that the project may be taken in hand at as early a date as possible. Per haps Government would be prepared to/depute an officer with the necessary ex perience of artesian wells to visit Kuwait for a preliminary investigation on the spot, after wffiich it may be possible so to expedite the work as to realize in part, if not entirely, the Shaikh’s desire that some plant should be in working order by the beginning of next summer. Translation of a letter, dated the 28th Zul-al-Kaada 1330 (9th November 1912), from Shaikh Sir Mubarak-as-Subah, Ruler of Kuwait, to Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K. C. I. E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. After Compliments— We would represent to your High Honour that I, your friend and (am) depend ent on the regard of the Precious Government upon me and upon my home-land, (which regard) has increased our town of Kuwait with inhabitants and popula tion and I see all that, that it is from the counsels (utterings) of the Precious Gov ernment, May God assist it with Glory and Fortune and make us suitable to the gaining of its approval. I beg from the Precious Government, through your High Honour, assistance for us in the bringing of water for our town, (which, as we have represented, is troubled from the shortage of sufficient water); we bring it from the Shatt-al-Arab and it is insufficient and there happen difficult winds to the boats and they are delayed ; and the wells do not suffice and we are much worried over water and we ask the help of the Precious Government by one of two methods which may bring out water for us, whichever may be best in your view, either a machinery plant for making it from sea-water or by digging which may produce water from the earth. And when your Honour decides on one of these two ways, if the Precious Govern ment orders there should be an officer from them we would put a fixed price on a kerosine-tin or if it should be to me your dependent the cost should be upon me in instalments such as you may approve. Without the help of the Government upon us in bringing vrater we will be worried about water and we have represented the details to your Honour, and we ask benevolence of the kindness of the Govern ment to our help for this object and we expect kindness and benevolence. This (is what was necesary) and the order is with you. G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C.600 F.

In continuation of my letter No. 2017, dated tlio 3rd ApKl 1913, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a report by Mr. E, H. Pascoe, Assistant Superintendent in this Department, upon the prospects of obtaining oil near Kuwait, Persian Gulf. Prospects of obtaining oil near Kuwait&gt; Persian Gulf. Some 24 miles south of Kuwait, a small area of Tertiary rocks projects above the surface of the Desert, and is introduction. known as Burqan. I examined it between the dates 2nd to 5th March, 1913. Burqan is close to the rock known as Wara, and consists of some small R u knolls and rising ground The knolls are ridge-like and are grouped along or parallel to the permiter of a broad ellipse, which represents in all probability a low flat dome with its longer axis running approximately from north to south. The monotony of the flat plain occupying the centre is relieved by a few additional knolls. Comglomerate or conglomeratic sandstone, exactly similar to those at Wara, caps all these knolls and ridges, and in all cases has a scarcely appreciable dip. There is much sagging at its edges and a great deal of scree, but here and there it is possible to observe what lies beneath it. Below it, in the easternmost ridges, I found bands of ochreous sandstone, sandy clays of variegated colours—red, pink, yellow, etc., a white kaolin-bearing sandstone, and many large fragments of selenite or crystalline gypsum. Flakes of gypsum occur in other parts of the hills, and the efflorescent salt in the central plain. All this points to the exposure, or immediate proximity beneath the surface of Dr. Pilgrim’s “ Pars *' series I am inclined to think the Pars beds are actually exposed, the caps of conglomerate and conglomeratic sandstone representing the basal bed of the Bakhtiari series. The Ears exposure would be about a mile long by f- mile broad. The geotectonic features appear to run, in a general way, somewhere between north, south and north-west-south-east. This is borne out (i) by the orientation of the Burqan dome and the stluctu,e ' relative position of Wara Hill (a little west of north from Burqan), (ii) by the general strike and trend of outcrops in Persia and further south in Arabia, (Hi) by the trend of the Persian Gulf and Euphrates and Tigris Valleys, (tv) by the direction of the low flat swell-ridges observed and mapped by Captain Shakespear further inland. The eastern slope of these flat swells is considerably more gradual than the western, a circumstance conformable with the chart of the Gulf which shows a very gentle eastward shelving along the Arabian side but a comparatively steep drop into deep water along the Persian coast. From this we may deduce that easterly-dipping beds cover a greater proportion of the total area than do westerly-dipping beds. The dome at Burqan is a very gentle one. A little bituminous earth is found in the central plain. The prospects of obtaining an oil supply depend Oil principally upon (j) 0&gt;i the age and the capacity for storage of the rocks, (ii) structure, {Hi) position with regard to the oil “ belt.” The age of the beds is favourable, if it is correct to assume they belong to the Ears, since this is the oil-bearing series in Persia. There is no reason to believe the nature of the beds beneath Burqan should be different from that of the Ears in Persia, and they may be looked upon therefore as sufliciently porous to retain oil in workable quantities. The structure, if correctly diagnosed, is also favourable, a gentle dome in fact being an excellent C19FD \ ^2 type of folding suitable for an oil-field. As to its geographical position, this locality is not on the line of strike of the rich oil deposits now being worked above Alm az, and is, in fact, over 170 miles to the south-west of this line. This does not necessarily mean that oil in commercial quantity does not occur below Burqan, but it adds a decidedly speculative element to any operations. A “floating tract of naphtha,” coiaciding no doubt with a submarine seepage was described by Captain Constable as occurring between the islands of Qaru and Kubbar, some 56 miles south-east of Burqan. On the whole, my opinion is that the chances are not unfavourable, and that an oil company would not require much inducement to test it, if protection and permanency of concession were guaranteed. The central plain of Burqan would be the best site for tests, and these should be as deep as possible, as the uppermost layers of the Bars are probably all that are exposed. Under present conditions there would be great difficulty in obtaining water for the boiler ; possibly an internal combustion engine would have to be employed.

I do not know offhand if oil exists in the two other pi ices of which mention v/as made , $ but Bushire is being asked to search in our archives to see if any allusion is made to it.

Charteris A. Stewart enquiring for information re certain oil seepages mentioned in “ Engler’s Petroleum ” as existing in the neighbourhood of Bernaid-el-Or (near Kuwait) and the Islands of Garu, Tarsi and Halul. Mr. Stewart is believed to be in the employ of Lord Cowdray and presumably connected with 44 Pearsons.” He has already applied in similar letters to the one now under refer ence to the Political Agent, Bahrain, and to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, who have in each case referred him to me. Your letter, Sir, No. 299, dated 7th July 1914, to His Excellency Sir Louis Mallet has reached me in blue print and would seem to imply that His Majesty’s Government are not averse to introducing the Turkish Petroleum Company into Nejd and Basrah. As regards the actual places in respect of which Mr. Stewart desires informa tion Bernaid-el-Or should read Banaid-ul-Qar which, with Qaru, is included in the territory of the Shaikh of Kuwait. “ Tarsi ” should probably read “ Farsi ” and is probably an appanage of El Aksa, in which case negotiations should be undertaken with Bin Saud, recently appointed as Turkish Mali of Nejd. Halul is indeterminate, but the island itself is well known and a beacon has lately been erected tkeie by His Maiesty’s Government in connection with the Lighting and Buoying Scheme in the Persian Gulf. It probably belongs to the Shaikh of Abu Dthabi. As regards indications of oil, the names Banaid-ul-Qar and Qaru certainly suggest pitch or bitumen and the Persian Gulf Gazetteer at page 617, Volume II, speaks of an intermittent spring of bitumen existing under the sea m the neighbour hood of Halul. I have no special information in regard to Farsi and have not been able to find anything in my records. Such informations as we have m this office of these indications is very meagre and generally confined to fisherman’s talk of pitch floating in the open sea. I fear therefore that it would be of httle use to Mr. Stewart.5 A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to the Government of India for in formation.

Letter dated the 30th July 1914.CONFIDENTIAL Docket From To D.O. Dated Mr,Leo Malcolm ,a Britieh protege residing at Bushire, thinks that he has got on the track of red oxide and sulphur mines in Kuweit territory . He approached me on the subject of what would be our attitude towards him if he attempted to get a concession to work them from the Shaikh . I sounded Foreign who reply Demi Officially as follows. Under the terms of the engagement of 23rd January 1899,we may consider Shaikh Mubarak debarred from granting leases or concessions to foreigners without)/ the previous consent of His Majesty’s Government. As it stands this engagement does not cover the case now of British subjects ;but it would be a simple matter to warn Shaikh Mubarak that we hope in his own interests he will apply the principle to British subjects also. After our experience in the case o f Abu Musa ,we should not ,when consulted ,concur without full enquiry and knowledge both of the prospects of the enterprise and the terms proposed. The present moment,with the Anglo-Turkish Convention as yet unpublished and this international upheaval in prospect is not one at which we want to start any new questions or enterprises,which can be postponed without inconvenience. Subject to any observations you may wish to make ,1 think the best J&gt;lan in the present case would be firstly for Politi= cal Agent ,Kuweit ,to refer ,in conversation with the Shaikh to the instument of 1899,and say that we hope he will apply the same principle^ to British subjects and give no concessions witt =out taking our advice .Having got his assurance on this point you might then tell Leo Malcolm that the Shaikh would give no Coiipw-aion without consulting us and that the juncture is Telegram • Knox,He sident,Bushire.

I understood from him th^t he h Q d he^rd of no oil shows in the neighbourhood of Zobeir but th^t there h^d been people prospecting for various minerals in that district from time to time.

The position as regards Toveit, v/here I understand that recent investigations have 'iven promise of good results, is not quite the same. If the status of the Shaikh of Xoweit vis a vis the future British Administration of these Territories is to be mutatis mutandis analogous to that agreed to before the war and embodied in the draft Ahglo Turki sh Convention, then it is open to question whether the Shaikh has power to grant oil rights for his exclusive f*nancial benefit. It may be better for such rights to he granted by H.I ,G. after the war, to a selected institution on suitable terms, with the consent of th&lt;° Shaikh, on t.o-prna to h© arranged with him by us. • oreover it nay be convenient that oil ri ;ht? in not dealt with piece weal.
