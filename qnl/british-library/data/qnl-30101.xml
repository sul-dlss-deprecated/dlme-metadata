There has been no significant change in the situ ation in the Fifth Ustan. In the absence of a definite lead from Tehran the local administration has just carried on in the vaguest_possible way, hesitating to commit itself to any line of action whicn might, by any stretch of imagination, be construed as either pro-Tudeh or anti-Tudeh. The fact that the Azerbaijan question was being su itted to the United Nations becurity Council at the end of ti.. month somewhat revived the hopes of local Persians who, up to tnat moment, had been most, downcast and gloomy. The tall of Hakimi’s Cabinet and the appointment of Qavam-as-Saltaneh as his successor were received apathetically enough, the general view being tnat it made no difference at all who was or was not Prime minister in Tehran so long as the basic problem of boviet-Persi'an relations had not been settled. LOCAL GOVERNMENT: 2. The Governor-General, Aqa Kalantari, has played a rather effaced role this month and has been seen but little, he himself having undergone a slight operation at the American Hospital for the removal of a small tumour on the back of the neck, while his wife ^as been in strict mourning for the death of h*er cousin, killed in a motor car smash in Tehran. 3. Colonel BAY3ND0R, O.C. Troops, returned from Tehran early in January and left a few days later for BIJAR (GARHUS) where he is expected to remain until the situation in Azerbai jan is cleared up. He has a strong military post there, with an advanced post at TIKAB but SHAHIN DEZH is reported to be still held by the Democrats, though closely threatened by the AFSHARS who are believed to be waiting only for the snows to melt to deliver the final assault on the town, the immediate environs of which are already in their hands. There is some ground for believing that he may be organising some sort of guerrilla or partisan movement in this area but no definite news regarding this is available iolonel PIbHJAD is in command in Nermanshah during his ^Dsence. 4. Aqa ABDULLAH ASHRAFI was appointed Governor of 3HAHABAD about the 4th January in succession to KHU3RU QUBADTAN, brother of ABBAS QUBADIAN (AMIR MAKHSUS), Majlis meputy for Kermanshah and claimant to the headship of the KALHUR (BAVAND- PUR) tribe* Ashrafi actually arrived at Kermanshah on January 22 nd but at the end of the month had not ventured to go out and take possession of his new post,(bee para 13 below) 5, Aqa TEYMUR BEG MALEK ASLANT, Director of Roads, left Kermanshah with Colonel HASHEMI for Khurramabad on January 5th and did not return. Later it was reported that he had been appointed Director of Railways in Tehran e ^ 006 7^ At Ramadan AHMAD SALAHI has been appointed n C‘A /Governorr* Governor in place of GAnJAn ArvAAll who, in corrmon T nfh most of tile important members of the Qaragozlu family, is now in Tehran, oalahi arrived at hamadan on January And and when seen by n,^.. Consul, ivermanshah, at the end of the month, seemed to be. con fident that he had complete control of the situation. He com plained that Sardar Akram, despite his personal charm, was unfamiliar with the bureaucratic machine and had noc supervised the local Government Deoartments properxy, with the result that «^they had all got out of hand 0 Salahi thought that by judicious exercise of his powers and ix^eval of one or two undesirable departmental chiefs he could re-establish good administration He has already changed the Chief of Police and the Mayor (see next para). 7. Aqa AHMAD JEHANSHAHI, who was Acting Ustandar of the Vth Ustan from about August 1944 to August 1945, has been appointed Mayor and Assistant Governor of Hamadan, He was a friend of SALAHI, the Governor, when the latter was Farmandar of Kermanshah, and it is belie that they are neithei of them very well disposed towards Aqa .iantari, tie present Governor of Kermanshah, who would not have them here, preferring to have his own men about him (c.f. October Diary para 3) 8 . Aqa D^xHESHVAH, formerly Bakhshdar of Qasr-i-Shirin (June 1945 Diary para 5) a post which he lost in September 1945 (Septemoer uiary para S) when Qasr was raisea to the status of a Farmandari, returned to Kermanshah on January 25th as Inspec tor on benaif of the Ministry of interior. Ho is also believed to be anti-Kalantari. 9. It was reported from Tehran that Aqa lUBASIH HaUoKaB had been appointed Governor of Malay!r, Nothing is known of him here. 10. Colonel MIR HaSHEMI, Officer Commanding the Fth (Luristan) Division visited Ramadan at the end of December to superintend the installation of military posts R2ZAH and^ AVEJ with a view to forestalling a possible lightning thrust by the Azerbaijan “Democraos' from TAKISTAN dov/n the main road to Hamadan. A number of Lur chieftains from Khurramabad asked permission to accompany him so that they could see for them selves the situation in Hamadan and Avej, regarding which the wildest rumours had been circulating,, The Colonel authorized only some half a dozen representative chiefs to accompany him and they returned to Hamadan and thence to Khurramabad well satisfied with what they had seen. They assured Colonel Hashemi of their loyalty to the Iranian Government and begged for armb so that they could go and fight the 'Democrats” but the Colonel told them the time foi ‘.at had not yet come, After finishing his work in Hamadan l Lonel Hashemi came to Kerman shah to look -into the matter of the theft of a number of Persian Army rifles, 72 of which had mysteriously disappeared from the armoury in Kermanshah. One officer and two N.C.O,'s were arrested in this connection. Colonel Hashemi left for Khurram abad on January 5th. One of the rifles was traced' it had been sold by the two K.CA 0. 1 s for Rls 6,000/- to a grocer who had resold it for Rls 12,000/- to a tribesman. 11. Since his arrival here the Governor-General has been pressing the Central Government to send more gendarmes for this area. Instead, one hundred and fifty gendarmes were withdrawn during January and sent to Tehran. This leaves the local security forces very slender indeed, with the result that the Government authorities are not in a position to take a strong line on any subject in dispute even if they should wish to do so. ' _ TRIBAL: On January 9th the representatives of leading tribes /in the 12.in the Kermanshah area sent telegrams tq&gt; the hnah, tne Majlis and the Prime Minister affirming their loyalty and readiness to fight if required in view of the events in Azerbaijan (cuf, paragraph S above) 13. The situation in tne MALHUH (or hAVAiiDPUR) tribe j^s complicated by the dismissal of iuiUSRU’ QUJAVIAJ from the post Governor of ShiJrlABAi) (c.f. para 4 above). He had just' succ eeded in coming to terms with his tribal rivals, the a^'ZaMIS, (c.f. December uiary par 10) and by establishing friendly relations with neighbouring tribes had built up a position which contributed materially to the secutity of the area south west of Hermanshah and on the main road from Hermanshah to Qasr-i-Shirin. While his appointment to Shahabad in the first place was a mistake on the part of the Tehran Government, his revocation after fi#e months' tenure of the post was an even greater mistake. Khusru Khan came to Kermanshah on January 6th on his way to Tehran but his departure called forth loud com plaints from the tribal headmen, in deference to which he re turned to Shahabad. The headmen en began telling' the author ities at Kermanshah and Tehran i no uncertain terms that they did not intend to accept the new Governor and if he came out to Shahabad it would be at his own risk and peril and they would not be responsible for the consequences. As a result of this opposistion the new Governor had not ventured to proceed to his post from Kermanshah when the month ended. 14. In the SIHJiiSI tribe the case against the ex-Bakhsh- dar, Kerim Khan Barkhurdari, for alleged sale of Government rifles still drags on in the Military Court and the Governor- General, despairing of finding a really good candidate for the po,st, has decided,-not without consulting H.M. Consulate, to appoint KHaH BA^iiTlArt, who, until recently'’* was exiled at the request of the British authorities. His record, however, is by no means a bad one, and there is a chance that, being a man of property, he may not fleece the tribesmen to the same extent as did Kerim Khan barkhurdari while at the same time he is definitely far less dangerous to peace and security than t£e only other possible candidate, AbGhij^ KHAN SIKJaHI-, who has been intriguing as hard as he possibly sran ever since he was permitted to return to Kermanshah* 15. In southern Kurdistan the situation was quiet. MAHMUD KHAN KANI SANANI, who had made his submission and been sent to Tehran, died of pneumonia in hospital there. The Kurds were at first disposed to regard this as another Persian trick but later it was established even to their satisfaction that his death really was due to natural causes, and their confid ence in Brigadier HUMAYUNI was restored, Mahmud Khan’s son, MUHAMMAD HAIDARI, who is in SAN. ,.AJ, has asked to be granted his late father’s rank of Colone. in the Persian Gendarmerie but has been told that he is on probation at present, his promises of good behaviour and service to the Persian Govern- •ment having not yet reached the stage of performance. If he carries them out, he may hope to be rewarded with his father’s rank* One hundred and fifty rifles have been surrendered by the Kani Sananis but they still hold some. In REZAB HASSAN KHaN REZiiBI has not yet actually come in to Sanandaj but he has returned from ’Iraq and is at present living in, one of his villages, while a Persian Colonel with a few men is stationed in REZAB. Hassan Khan’s son, MUZZAEFAK is in Sanandaj, however, and General HUHAYUNI has reason to feel satisfied on the whole with the situation in the aUrOmaN TAKHT tnough he does not entirely exclude the possibility of troubles tfciere in the spring. /16, In the^tiic AUHOMAl^ luJiUNI tribe there hn .3 Q.fre.''n bepn nenht° n ^ 3EG » Bakhshdar of' Pavfh‘and h? s recontiv v 0l 2 ttle ^- ate ^EhIM BEG, The agreement ^; ly concluded between them has broken down, DrincapaUy, if not entirely, over the question of the division of the p^y ih™ t ,ahufll Gendarmerie, some 134 men in all.

In this way the Persian authorities, for tne sake of a negligible pecuniary gain, are . can ? thdir boot to upset the peace of a large area and to impair tne morale of a tribe which has been extremely loyal ana well-benaved. attempt to settle the dispute amicably nrough the mediation 01 the head of the neighbouring JAV^JrtJvl tribe failed completely owing to the intra«si- geance of Izzat beg who is reputed to have spent o^ gamb^eeS away all the money his father left and all the Gendarmerie pey for several months to come as well. POLITICAL: 1 { 7 * Political interest was chiefly centred on the elections for the provincial council (c.f, December Diarv Su ra m^2 u- 01 *?! 01 * as he i d, the co-operation of the Tudeh in the elections the G ernor-Gener 1 appointed J 3 jae oupervisory Committee two notables who were thought ARm e Mm?T r fp i ends n AMIR MUQIADIR, a local landowner and AbUL moaLI, a lawyer and President of the Municipal Council, as the result of therfr manoeuvres, the first named of these W f Pres i dent the Supervisory Committee and the second its Secretary, and although the Right parties had lour representatives as against these two ’Left members, the latt^rs tenancy of the key posts of President and Secretary of the Committee enabled them to bring the election proceed ings to a standstill. To get out of the jam, the Governor- General persuaded the Tudeh Party to disavow AMIR MUQTAuIR unu ii-SUL mOkiuI who were, they said, not party members at all and to submit a list of party members from which he would choose two names to replace Amir Muqtadir and Abul Moal-i on tne Supervisory Committee. Amir Muqtadir and Abul Moali, therefore resigned and the Tudeh presented a list including such names as SHOHaBPUR, MUHSIR aLaVI and FARAHPUR v/ell- known crouble-makers whom the Governor-General could not bring himself'to accept* he therefore called for a new list bur up to the end.of the month the two new members of the bupervisory Council had not been appointed and the election P P 2 c ® edin Ss^were^ still in suspense* The Right mem-b-ers are RAFAT-as-SADI aNEH PaLIZI and Aqa Tavakuli, landowners, HAJI DAI, merchant and Aqa ALLAMEH, head of the ’ADALAT party. d3 ! 3 connection with these elections, the Tudeh Party tri-ed to organise a public Demonstration in Kermanshah town on Friday, January 25th, As the a^ti-Tudeh parties were fast losing hehrt,.the Governor-Gener advised them to take this same opportunity to bring their m ibers out ir.fco the open and declare themselves publicly and irrevocably. This they r£ rded dc ^5 du ’* : both on their side and on the .part of the ludeh the demonstration turned out to be a very half-hearted affhir, very few persons venturing to commit themselves toe far* The Governor-General, who had been hoping to find enough strength in the f Adalat, Mardum and Iradeh-yi-Melli parties to enable them to put up some sort of a show against /growing' ve^nfgative rflS!t? iVSneSS ’ W£S somewhat discouraged, by this iiGHICULTUHE &amp; SUPPLIES: Th 9 supply position remains fairly good.

Heavy frost and snow were experienced in January d.nd prospects for the 1946 harvest are good so far. ECONOmlC &amp; COL/iMEHClAL: nnH The uncertainty caused by the political situation and the restriction of credit by the Hanks had their effects on markets here, as elsewhere in Iran. Business was on a greatly reduced scale with prices weakening. Transport and mail delays towards the end of the month caused great inconvenience Money remained tight in the Bazaar with rates from 18 to 24$, / ? ?! , . first signs of post-war stringency in Kermanshah followed quickly after the departure of the British Forces, essrs. ivlEHDI PIRaYESH, A.a. and A.Q. KAMYAB, who had been f or meat, eggs etc u , got into difficulties and the HAMYAB brothers disappeared leaving Pirayesh to hold the baby, e was indebted to the three lee .ng Banks at one time for over half a million Rials but the Impelial Bank collected their out- standings without difficulty and the two remaining Banks, the Ottoman Bank and the Bank-i-Milli also managed to‘ collect most of the money due to them, though the Ottoman Bank‘still had a fair amount to receive at the end of the month. This affair, together with the troubles in Azerbaijan, rather scared the market and lor a time the Banks were making no advances, but later they resumed. As a precaution, however, they reduced their risks 50$ and required at least three good signatures on each bill, BRITISH INTERESTS: 23. Mr E.W. Shneerson, Acting Vice-Consul at Kermanshah (December Diary para 17) returned from Khanaqin on January 1st, Ho left again for Khanaqin on January 24th on reversion to the Army. • Mr G.C.

Sinclair, from which they stole clething and effects valued at about Rls„ 20,000/-. The police had not traced the thieves or recovered any of the stolen property by the end of the month. 99 *, ^Some 3,600 feet of copper telephone wire belonging to Messrs. Rerrnanshah Petroleum Company were stolen on the out skirts of Kermanshah town on the night of January 9/10, the third robbery of the kind which had taken place at the same spot recently. Despite energetic protests to the local author- iti/ 3 .neither the police nor the Gendarmerie, each of whom seemed to think it was the other’s affair, succeeded in tracing the stolen wire or arresting the culprits. 9 the middle of January reports were received that Kermanshah Petroleum Comapny tankers passing through TAKISTAN were being stopped.and # examined at the Red Army check post there. The method of examinatioh, it was reported, was for a Red Army man to break the Company’s seal on the .dajpn-hole on the top of the tanker, open the cover and lower a lighted hurricane-lamp into the aperture. The Company warned all their drivers to keep well away from the tankers while these operations were in progress. In a friendly manner and without making any complaint, the matter was brought to the attention of the Soviet Consul in Kermanshah who promised to it up with the Soviet author ities in KaZVIR and a few day^ iter it was learned that the examination had been stopped; was pointed out to the Soviet Consul that quite apart from the risk of explosion or fire there was nothihg to prevent dishonest chauffeurs from tampering with tne contents of the tankers once the Company’s seal had been broken. ’• AMERICAN IRTEREdTS: Major Garver, d.S. nir Attache, Tehran arrived at Kermanshah by plane on January 9th accompanied by Colonel Aikeny Col, Stetson of the U.S. Army and Miss Gebo of Federal Economic Administration, Tehran. They left for Bagdad on 11th January having been delayed owing to bad weather. RUSSIAN INTERESTS: 33. . The Russian Vice-Consul, M. Kochelev, visited Ramadan in January and exhibited some photographs and pictures in* the Armenian Church. He also invited Armenians who wished to return to their ’’home-land” in Soviet Armenia to register their names and a numoer of the poorer Armenians did this. They were, however, told that they could not expect to go to Soviet Armenia before the next harvest. 34. The Assyrian community in Kermanshah was greatly stirred by a rumour (apparently emanating from a Russian source, though this has not been really proved) that it was planned to establish a Christian state 100,000 miles square in area stretching from'westLake Urmia to Mosul and including Kirkuk and the oilf: is. The revenues of the new /statestate would come from royalties on oil which ^Sn partnership with the Soviet Union. Many *ssyrii.ns fW g ..y impressed with the scheme though apparently sensors had omitted to mention how it was proposed to deal with tne Moslem (Arab and Kurdish) majority in the area in question, to some - whom (e.g. the Kurds) the Russians had certainly givi.g promises which could not by any means be squared with tne proposals Tor the Assyrians. 35 The usual rumours of consignments of Russian ^ rm s reaching Ramadan and Kermanshah '' . and being distributed among Tudeh supporters in the towns and among well-disposed tribesmen.were current during the month but not an atom oi evidence was discoverable to support these rumours.

Inspector of the Ministry of Interior, returns from Tehran. Asadullah Khan Bakhtyar has promised the Governor-General that he will be reasonable with Kerim Khan and willf not injure or oppress him in any way so there is at ldo.«t a hope that this somewhat troublesome tribe will now seCtle down though the unceasing intrigues of the stormy petrel ASGHAR KHAN SINJABI will doubt less not help matters. Asghar Khan is a bitter enemy of Kerim Khan and undoubtedly has a certain influence over Asadullah Khan, the new Bakhshdar. POLITICAL: &lt; v 11. No progress was made with the elections for the Provincial Council which remained in the state described in paragraph 17 of the Diary for January, 12. On the. 15th February and again on fehcs 22nd February the Tudeh Party tried to organise mass demonstrations in the main street of Kermanshah but they had only a very limited suceess and entirely failed in their main object which was to impress the authorities and the populace with their growing strength and might. On the 15th the Soviet Consul's car con taining the Consul himself and members of his staff was observ to be accompanying t.:e demonstrators up the main street - of course entirely by an accidental coincidence, as he was at pairs to explain to H.M.

The Ustandar, having practic- ally no direct authority of any sort, can only hope to dominate ^ne ueads of Government Departments by sheer force of personality xailing which he is apt to become a mere cypher.

When the Tudeh speakers began abusing the landlords in general and tribal chiefs in particular, the tribesmen : s always somewhat summary patience was exhausted and they attacked the speakers, two of whom_were beaten up fairly soundly and later Drought into hospital in Kermanshah where it was, however, soon established that they were little the worse for their experiences. Things might have been much worse had net the Qubadians, against whom the Tudeh party inveighed -o much, used their influence and authority to restrain and fina / disperse the tribesmen before any real harm was done. On this occasion again, the forces of kks law and order, who were present in Shahabad, took no part in the proceedings. AGRICULTURE &amp; SUPPLIES: 11» # Heavy rains were recorded in Kermanshah during March C4.65 ins. as against 1,59 ins. last year) and caused some flood ing on March 15th. These rains, combined with the exceptionality good winter snowfall have made the crop prospects excellent. It is Estimated that a surplus of abojit 5,000 tons of wheat and 13,000 tons of barley still remaining from last year's harvest and good crop prospects are discouraging would-be hoarders, disposal of the barley is likely to be a difficult problem if this year’s crop prospects are realised but the wheat is being gradually bought up and transported to Tehran, Yezd, Kerman and other districts where supplies are more scarce. 12, _ ^ Large quantities of American second-hand clothing arrived at Kermanshah in March and caused a fall in the price of piece-goods. ECONOMIC &amp; COMMERCIAL: 13, Political uncertainty kept the market quiet and little business was done. Money rates were 18 to 24$ 0 BRITISH INTERESTS: 14.

Abundant rain throughout the area with exceptionally good grazing and good harvest prospects in consequence probably had a good deal to do with this state of pence,. lie The Kurdish Republican threat to SAQQIZ, EANEH and SARDASHT (c,f, March diary para V.' was considered serious at the beginning of the month when brigadier KOMAYUNI flew down from Sanandaj to Kermanshah in h: own plane on April 3rd and had a long talk with H.M, Consul, in which he emphasized particularly the desirability of Iraqi co-operaoion in establishing military posts on their side of the f:°-' ■ or and taking action to secure the return of HAMA RASHID a... ...__jM.H MUSTaPA BARZAUI from Iran to Iraq, Later, however, it eased considerably when the road from Sanandaj to Saqqiz, which 1 ad been six or eight feet deep in snow / wa ^finally cleared sufficiently :-c a Alov military trucks to move upo Almost immediately, however, heavy :ains unforcunathhy turned the section from DIVahuARREH he 3iqoi;. into a. quagmire and at one moment upwards of 50 vehicles, .xr actically alx the Army transport available, were bogged ciown.

He returned to Sanandaj the following day, POLITICAL: 12. After their set-•b*:ok at SPAHABAD (c.f. March diary para 10) the Tudeh party in Karm-.T-Lah were rather subdued and showed very little activity. Indeed at the end of the month all their energies were needed to cope with a split in their own ranks. According to the story, while their leader, ALAVI, was in hospital recovering from the beating he had sustained at Shahabad, the emissary of the Soviet ( .msulate came to the Tudeh Headquarter with the cuntomary financial aid and enquired to whom it should be handed over in the absence of Alavi* /'The* - 4 - Th® other leaders, who professed to have been kept in ignorance i tnis subvention, thereupon started asking questions as to its amount and how it had been disposed of: the conclusion arrived at was tnat Alavi had pocketed most of it. a great rumpus ensued, some of tne party patriotically objecting to taking foreign money, others more broad-mindedly not caring a fig where the money came from but caring very much indeed that they should not have had a share in it, and in the end some of the leaders seceded and set up a rival Workers and Peasants Party of their own. How long this will last without outside financial support remains to be seen, but the fact remains that the local prestige of the Tuden was down to a very low ebb at the end of the month. AGRICULTURE &amp; SUPPLIES: + Heavy rains fell during April all over the area, with resultant excellent pasturage for flocks and herds and very good crop.prospects. It was stated at the end of the month that the Persian Government was to start buying wheat at the basic price oi his. ^, 000 /- per ton but no actual buying was reported, though there are ample stocks of grain, especially barley, available from last year’s harvest. On orders from Tehran the new Ma^or, ABBaS SaDH, ^^5 above) trieu to reduce the cost of living by fixing retail prices of commodities and having one or two persons flogg- ed for selling above the official rate. The only noticeable result was tnat tne commodities in question, e.g. eggs disappeared altogether from the market for a few days. ECONOMIC &amp; COmaEKCIaL: IB. market conditions continued throughout the month. There was little doing in sugar, tea or piece-goods, howghan, on the other nand, was in good demand.

The fact that negotiations between the Persian Go -ernment on the one hand and the Azerbaijan Demo crats and Kurdish Republicans on the other hand were supposed to ^ be in progress did not deter them at all. They were estimated to have some 15 : 000 horsemen in the field along the 'front” running from Sardasht by Baneh and Saqqiz to TAKAB, including OMAR AQA GHAKKAK with 2 000 men in LIRADEH (between Saqqiz and Baneh) and HAI1A RASKID and SHEIKH MUSTAFA BARZANI between Miradeh and Saqqiz. Despite these advantages, the Kurds failed in all the three attacks mentioned above (one at Sardasht, one at Miradeh and the third, in which they were supported by Democrat forces, at Takab) and suffered ccmparatively heavy casualties: in the Miradeh affray alone Omar Aqa Shakkak is said to have lost about 80 men kihledj IGLf .Tabriz Radio managed to distort these Kurdish acts of aggression into unprovoked attacks on Azerbaijan by the Persian Government for es and made such propaganda value out of them that the Prime Minister consented to allow a commission of 3 representatives of the Persian ^rmy, 3 Azerbaijan Democrats and 3 Kurdish Republicans to visit the front, investigate the incidents and make arrangements to prevent any repetition of them. They arrived at Banandaj on the 25th May but had not been able to reach an agreement by the end of the month. POLITICAL: 11o The event of the month was an attempted May Day demonstration by the Tudeh Party in Kermanshah. Despite repeated warnings that public demonstrations were forbidden and would be prevented by force if need be, they attenrued to march down the main street of Kermanshah after holding a big meeting in the Homay Cinema. Police, reinforced by Gendarmerie, attempted to prevent them and were proiftly attacked by Tudeh members who opened fire, killing one policeman and one Gendarme. The Assistant Chief of Police, Major RAFI'I, wh@ was in charge, thereupon gave the order to fire. The demonstrators then dispersed. Total cas ualties were ten killed (including tiro wounded who died later in hospital) and about 18 wounded. Some of the Tudeh leaders, in cluding MUHSIN ALAVI. HASSAN GANDUMI and ALI AKBAR MUKRI were arrested, while others, including ALI AFIFI , KARAMATULLAH AFSAR and REZA YAZDIAN, ran away. The Tudeh press made such a howl about this incident that the Persian Government sent a commission consisting of ASEFI and MIR SIPASI (Police),1 T ZAM QUDS (Ministry of Interior) and MUSTAFAVI (Ministry of Justice) to investigated The Tehran Tudeh Party attached SHAHZADEH AZ f UD to this commission as their renresentative and his influence was such that the first act of the commission was to release the Tudeh leaders from prison and put the Assistant Chief of Police under arrest. This had a most unfortunate effect on the morale of tte officials charged with the maintainance of law and order who will certainly hesitate to take action against the Tudeh next time the occasion arises. Major Rafi 1 ! was still under arrest at the end of the month but had been summoned to Tehran, Col. Asefi left for Tehran on May 31st but the other members of the commission were still here at the close of the month.

He took possession ol his posr, immediately. Sarhaddar is an old protege of General Razmara and r also rendered considerbble assistance to British Area i^iaiso Officers while they were in th^ area. Although ven^.1 an c what unreliable, he is strongly right wing and doubtless been '’placed” by Razmara to court the sympathy of £he RALh b for a scheme to support the Government witn armed force m the event of a flare-up in Azerbaijan. 6 . MORTEZA’ ASFA, Ra’is-i-Amlak (Supervisor of Crown Lands) at Shahabad tendered his resignation on June oth. The Ministry of Finance has hot yet recognised J^ti-on, prompted partly on account of the difficulties of collec -g rent from recalcitrant tribesmen and also, no doubt, because ^ post is not sufficiently lucrative from a more personax po-nt of view. 7 . Colonel KEMAL, formerly O.C. Gendarmerie at Kermanshah, left on June 10th to take up his new appointment in Isfahan..on the 18th, however, it was announced that he had been re-appom to KermaAshah at Ahe request so it is said ^General Razmara_ and the Ustandar. Col. Kemal’s return will be welcomed in ^i 0 n wing circles since he was a reasonably efficient and Honest official, in contrast to Col. YAMINI who had been nominated as his successor and was reported to be rather vena^.^ 3 the instance of the Ministry of Health, a certain Dr MASHAYEKHI came to Kermanshah in the middle o^ the montn to collaborate with the local Health Department in an anti-malaria cftnpaign in the Kermanshah - Sanandaj area. He has a heavy tasK before him. 9 On the 13th June, I.'Tohandes SHIR DEL arrived from Tehran and proceeded to Shahabad where he was to be in charge of the sugar factory. Little is known of the man as he has never been in the district before, but he is not thought ^ He Tudeh sympathies. If this is so, it may bo another indication that the Prime Minister is trying to build up a strong tlocA ^ pro-Government officials in the area to offset, m some Hegroe, the deplorable leftist rot that appears to be consuming othe. parts of the country. 10 The parlous situation in Khorramshahr ^recently stirred local philanthropists, who readily utions when the Ustandar formed a commission to help alleviate the distress of flood victims. Money accumulated quite quicvl, and it was thought that a considerable sum would have been raised when the fund was closed on July 1 st. TRIBAL: n During the month, it became increasingly evident ^ that the Governor-General was endeavouring to instil some urn^ of'purpose or at least of sentiment into the separate exemenrs^ in the area. Having expressed despair of ev ® r ™ 1 K^ n tion to seeking and hedonistic landowners, he turned his attention to the tribes, whose sugar ration had fallen due and * jNs token of good will might therefore yield results. The prcvio.s Ustandar, FATHOLLAH KALANT ARI, had, at one time, evoli ed a munificent scheme for ensuring that every single tribesm n received his rations regularly and without hindrance, by tn establishment of five distribution centres at which mdiviau- -- /couldcould present their ration cards and effect personal collection of rationed commodities. Ideally, the plan was most desirable, since it is a vexed question in Kermanshah as to when the poor tribesmen last saw Government rations of any kind. The tribal chiefs, however, seeing a major source of income about to dissolve before their eyes, went into a huddle, collected an enormous sum of money and persuaded Mr Kalantari, along with other inter ested parties in the town, that the old way of ration distribution was by far the better, M, Nikpey arrived at the same conclusion by. a shorter process of reasoning: gi^ie the tribal chiefs the tribal rations to play with on the black market and they will be quite content to accept the responsibility of explaining matters to their followers. Resultant peace and quiet can always be made to justify the means of arriving at it. Whether this action of the Governor-General’s was purely and attempt to secure tribal quiescence (always to the benefit of the district) or whether it was an election manoeuvre was not apparent. Such a policy almost invariably pays a dividend in any case. . On June 7th, a Tribal Commission was held in the Ustandari to discuss relations between landlord and tenant and possible measures for the proper utilization of land, water, etc. No decisions were made. 13, The death of QAMBAR SULTAN ASPERI, head of the QALKHANI tribe, was reported on June 3rd, His son, JEHANGIR, is ratner young and it is thought he may come too much under the influence of SAID SHAMS-ed-DIN HAIDARI, leader of the Ali Ullahi religious sect. Haidari is acnrin perpetually intriguing to spread his own personal power in that area. 14, Reference paragraph &amp; above, Sarhaddar returned to Kermanshah on the 3rd June from a mission,on behalf of General Razmara, to the JAVANRUDI tribe. It was said that he had instructions to offer arms and money in return for promised support of the Central Governnart in the event of an uprising in Azerbaijan. 13, On 6 th June, about 40Q cavalry from Khorramabad passed through Kermanshah en route for Saqqiz. It was also re ported from a reliable source that one division of cavalry had been sent to Saqqiz from Tehran. It has for some time been the opinion in military circles here that far too many troops were drained away from their proper duties in Kermanshah to bolster up Persian forces already at the front, so that these transfers of men and material from other centres have probably been made to prevent further depletion of the local garrison. 16. In the SENJABI tribe there was still trouble between ASADULLAH KHAN BAKHTIAR, the present Bakhshdar and KERIM KHAN BARKHORDARI, the ex-Bakhshdar, over the four rifles remaining in the custody of the latter. Asadullah Khan, a relation of the fiery ASGHAR KHAN SENJABI, wishes to take possession of even these few rifles, to which Kerim Khan has a very reasonable claim (for the protection of his village), for reasons not un connected with the coming elections. This demand is undoubtedly being pressed at the instance of itsghar Khan, who is known to be indulging in political activity on behalf of Dr KERIM KHAN SENJABI, one of the main Tudeh candidates for Kermanshah. POLITICAL: 17, Throughout the month, a distinct increase in Tudeh activity was noticed, helped no doubt by the establishment of new posts in Shahabad, Kerind and Sar Pol-i-Zohab, areas which had previously escaped contamination. The situation was /criticisedcriticised by one of Amir Makhsus's sons, who complained that, since his father was still in Tehran, nothing could be done in opposition, J,3o On the other hand, the Governor-General, obviously orking with support that had not merely been promised, expended much thought and energy on stirring up right-wing opposition. In fact, he admitted to H.M. Consul that he had urged the leading right-wing candidate, Vahid Allameh, to put seme life into his followers and sympathisers and not to let the Tudeh have things all its own way. By the end of the month it was certain that the Tudeh would have a much harder fight in the elections than if Kalantari had been left to control (?) the province,, 19. The main candidates representing the Tudeh and opposition were found to be roughly as follows Tudeh SULEIMAN A'ZAM ZANGANEH (AMIR MOQTADSR ) 0 Uncle of Amir-i-Kull, Recently donated two thousand tomans in aid of relations of Tudeh men killed on May 1 st (c.f.

Manager of the National Bank, Has an excellent reputation locally but does not stand much chance of election since he is a native of Rasht 20. One of the more annoying, methods of the Tudeh was reported recently in connection with local schools. There has for long been a large core of teachers of left wing tendencies in Kermanshah schools and they have overlooked few opportunities for inveighing against ^ reactionarics ,, , 'imperial ists' and dispensing generally the well-known Tudeh demagogic froth. Their latest effort was a threat, by insinuation, to fail all examinees who refused to attend Tudeh meetings. This added difficulty, combined with the normal financial ones^is likely to make academic success a major problem indeed, 21. On the 22nd June, Dr ANVAR SHAKI returned to Kermanshah in charge of the Red Lion and Sun Hospital, He was removed last year with considerable difficulty, but although at /that* • • DISTRIBUTION: As before. 5 to) that time he was one of the leaders of the local Tudeh party, he dtjasx had not recommenced activities by the end of the month, (c.f.

During the month, public interest was focussed on the development of the new ’’Democratic Party of Iran” to the exclusion of almost all other matters. The announcement of its formation produced a lull of uncertainty, both Right and Left-wing parties holding their applause or criticism until some indication of its eventual form should appear. Public reaction, too, was uncertain. V/hile support was event ually forthcoming from a group of influential landowners and notables of the right wing, before the names of the central committee were published, there were some interesting and significant exceptions (c.f. para 12 beftow). The cautious and those too deeply involved in the political game to take any step precipitately, refrained from associating them selves with the main movement to acknowledge the party and consulted the Delphic Oracle of H.M. Consulate where classical equivocation was handed out to them. The Tudeh party and sympathisers, on the other hand, appeared slightly non plussed. Articles in the ’Bisitun' newspaper tended to show that their first impulse was to accept a party inaugurated by ’’the only honest man in the Tehran Government”. That the articles were written after rightist support, in the form of a telegram, had been offered to the Prime Minister, pointed to some knowledge or feeling on the part of the Tudeh that the party was not going to be a windfall for the Right wing, and comment was limited to vindicating the ’democratic’ aims of the party in a few articles in the press. Political activity was reduced to a minimum, though H.M. Consulate received its daily batch of enquiries, and the situation remained obscure throughout the month. Events in Xhuzistan received no more than casual recognition. LOCAL GOVERNMENT: 2. On the 21 st July, the Governor-General received a telegram from the Prime Minister recalling him to the capital. He left on July 23rd for Tehran, where it is said that he has been appointed Assistant in some personal capacity to Qavam-as-Saltaneh. Up to the time of his removal, M. Nikpey had resolutely pursued his policy of strengthening right wing opposition to the Tudeh and, where insurmountable opposition was not encountered, he had directed local affairs v/ith exemplary efficiency. His frankly pro-British attitude and administrative zeal may have been the cause of his recall, although another school of thought considered that a more important job awaited him. The two alternatives are not necessarily incompatible for, while the Prime Minister might wish to withdraw Nikpey from a position where he incurred Xudeh censure and give him an insignificant post under personal surveillance, it is just as possible that his undoubted qualities had been found worthy of better employment. A clue to the correct interpretation may be provided by the appointment of his successor.

During the night of the 13th to 14th July, about eighty armed SENJABI tribesmen descended on the village of ™ KHAN BARKHORDARI, killing the latter's two nephews Ld looting tne place of all moveable property. The brigands were RAKHTT A R h \h° n ? ° f A ^ SADULLAH BAKHTIAli and SULEIMAN KHAN khav former s name being coupled with that of ASGHAR KHAN as the instigator of the'assault. The prime cause of this tribal, tussle was undoubtedly Kerim Khan’s refusal to give up Government rifles retained by him after he had been ousted from the position of Bakhshdar of Senjabi (c.f. June diary, p a ra 16). Another important contributory factor may be and ^ Ud Persisting between Kerim Khan and the Bakhtiars. Indeed, the popular explanation of this deed of violence - txiat the chance was taken to recover the rifles and to pay-off a few old scores at the same time - is therefore the best founded. The reports which reached H.

Since the departure of the ex-dstandar it has been reported on credible authority that General Razmara has telegraphed direct to the 0,0. Persian troops to have Salar Mansur removed from the position of Bakhshdar in favour of his brother, an ineffective old man, who would be under the influence of pro-Tudeh elements. The O.C. Persian troops.wriggled out of the matter by declaring that it was a question which concerned tho Acting UstandarT 9. On the I 8 t£i of the month, Col. CHAKAFPTH„ O.C, Troops at Kermanshah, returned from a mission to JAVANRUD, where he had been instructed to investigate reports tha 4- the Javanrudi tribesmen had been trafficking with the Kurdish Republican organisation, KOMALLA, He was accompanied by Salar Mansur who later informed H.M. Consul of the results of theii enquiries. Salar Mansur stated that disaffection was notice able particularly amongst the younger tribesmen who felt that, since British support and help were no longer forthcoming- there were advantages to be gained by truckling to the other side. This information, while ccnfirming reports from other sources, is susceptible to cricicism since it comes from a source whose opening gambit is the desertion by the British of their erstwhile friends. A representative of the lAKUKT called in connexion with the abov j-mentioned visit,, and. while denying any tendency to throw in his tribe : s‘lot with the Komalla, asserted that his followers did not have and would not have confidence in any Persian officials. This sentiment most probably applies to the Javanrudis as well, 19. ABBAS QCJBADlAH(.f.iTR MAKHSUS) returned from Tehran to Kermanshah on the 2 nd July and proceeded straight to Shahabad. His arrival there, it is said, had the immediate effect of stiffening his followers, certain of whom had been wavering uncertainly towards the left. This looks like another of the Prime Minister's contradictory actions with regard to this area., the best example being, of course, the appointment of M. Nikpey and his recall after less than two months' in office* Nevertheless, the general trend of events seems to indicate that Qavam-as-Saltaneh wants to keep the peace in this area, with power distributed as evenly as possible, so as not; to arouse outright Tudeh opposition, while maintaining the balance in favour of those who support the existing order of things. Later in the month, while returning an official call on the Farmandar of Shahabad (3ARHADDAR), H.M. Consul took the opportunity of visiting Qubadian in his summer village GUAVOR* Little of note arose from the conversation. Indeed, discussion followed a pattern which has become only too familiar of late“ whose names should be favoured as election candidates?; what wer\ our views on the new Democrat e p arty?; was the Prime Minister's policy worthy of support?; did we support the Central Government or favour an autonomous Hurd is'can? A rumour that Qubadian and Sarhaddar do ^ at hit It off too well was substantiated to some extent by the former £ s remark that Sarhaddar 'is really Tudeh'. This may or may not be so. Suffice it that Qubadian himself is considered rather light weight in local political circles- /POLITICAL;POLITICAL: 11 * A scrimmage between Tudeh supporters and followers of HEYATI (AMIR EHTESHAMI) occurred at Kerind on the 1st July. Various explanations were offered. The first was that tteyati had unreasonably demanded a third share of the cul tivation revenues from his land; another, that he wanted to export produce from his land to other districts. Whatever the reason, the local Tudeh party seized upon the sxfe chance for some flag-waving, speechmaking, mass protestations and other pastimes dear to the hearts of demagogues. Although they are said to have called in assistance from their counter parts in Qasr-i-Shirin and Sar Pol-i-Zohab, they were severely trounced by Heyati's men ? who publicly disgraced the Tudeh leader. An interesting side-light on this event was provided pn the 8 th July when Vahid Allameh (c.f. June diary para 18) hinted to H.M. Consul, with immoderate unction and self- satisfaction, that he had engineered the affray. This apocryphal statement needs no other comment than that similar assertions have been made by the same person in the past, &amp; 12, On the 8 th July, ALI A‘ZAM ZANGANEH (AMIR-I-KULL), heading an imposing list of other influential notables, sent a telegram to the Prime Minister, pledging support to x;he new Democratic Party and asking for a branch to be opened locally. A few days later, the Qavam replied, rather non- comittally, thanking them for their good wishes and patriot ic intentions and stating that a representative would be sent to Kerrnanshah, 'when the party has been organised', to help them fulfill their 'national aims'. As mentioned else where, (c.f. para 1 above) there were some important ommissions from the list of signatories of the original telegram, chief of these being Allameh and a wily landowner named TAVAKKULI who, like a professional chess-player, never makes a move until he can see exactly what its results rzill be. In any case, lack of further action from Amir Kull and friends may well have been interpreted as the cooling of their sympathy for the party, if not regret at over-hasty action. No Tudeh members were known to have given overt support to the party and left wing acknowledgement of it took the form of articles in the local press which emphas ised its ’liberal programme' and declared that ‘reactionaries’ would find no place in it. These articles, though v/ritten in the normal truculent vein of Tudeh utterances, were noticeably more than usually vague. 13. The chances of the two opposing factions, in the coming elections, seemed to be still fairly equally balanced. Allameh, chief candidate for the right, maintained his certainty of his own success and Stated that the Tudeh party would not succeed since it was a house divided against itself. This wiow sounds hopeful on the surface, but the same man, comparing the local situation with that in Sanandaj, was heard to remark: '...of course there is not the same danger there (Sanandaj) as there is here (Kermanshah)*' AGRICULTURE &amp; SUPPLIES: 14. Harvesting v/as begun during the month and crop prospects are already excellent. In the Senjabi area, however, hea*vy rain in the late spring (May - June) rotted the growing corn and the crop is said to be largely spoiled. ECONOMIC &amp; COMMERCIAL: 15, Slightly better conditions prevailed throughout /thethe month. Rowghan and piece-goods were in moderate^ demand. I*ioney remained easy v/ith bazaar rates at 10 /o to 18/o. BRITISH INTERESTS: 16 . H.M. Consul proceeded to Tehran on the 17th July, returning to his post on the 23rd. AMERICAN INTERESTS: 17. On the 11th July, His Excellency, the American Ambassador, arrived in Kermanshah by plane. He had an interview with the Governor-General, at which H.M. Consul was present and then returned to Tehran the same day. ★ ********* 18. The embracing extent of local politics was emphasised when the British Consul received a message from a lady asking for special consideration and a special evening interview in the office. Fortunately, evasion was practised as the lady turned out to be Abbas Qubadian's wife who was looking for advice with regard to divorce.

N ARBALAN, Ravansar 1) ASGHAR KHAN, brother of Dr Kerim Khan, and equally addicted to left-wing doctrine, is reported to be manoeuvering to oust the present Bakhshdar of Senjabi and take his place. Asghar Khan was removed from this area by the British during the war for security reasons. He is said to be frequented by the Governor-General. 2) SADEQ VAZIRI has completed his task of collect ing opium for the Government in this area and garnered 80 kharvars instead of the 12 collected by his predecessor the previous year. He wants to regain his former post of Director f Finance, at present neld by ISKANDARI, cousin of the editor of* Rahbar and almost as extreme, and has appealed to H.M. esentatives to help him, as otherwise he will in all ability be removed from the area. All reports show him to fficient, honest and frienaly disposed towards the British, !H PARTY: This has been a glorious month for the Tudeh, uring which their leaders have gained power and control more /quicklyEXT 6498 quickly and more completely tjhan they had dreamed possible. Strong supporters of the partly in official positions are the Directors of Finance and Education, the President of the Court of Appeal, the head of the Gendarmerie, and possiblythe Governor-General.The chief reason for their success is the change of balance in the Cabinet in their favour, and the ^demoralisation of those who expected something from the Democrat Party, the landowners and the British. Their main triumph has been the appointment as Director of Education of Mohsin Alavi, This individual was largely responsible for the shooting and riots of May 1 st, and, as head of the Shahpur school,threatened all pupils with failure in their examinations if they did not promise to adhere to his noisome party.lt was he also who ventured to Shahabad in the hope of fomenting disturbences among the tribes of that area. It*is significant that whereas at that time he and his followers were beaten up by the tribesmen the Tudeh have felt themselves sufficiently strong to send a deputation uninvited into the middle of the Kalhur district with the openly avowed intention of proselytising the tribesmen.On this occasion, however,they were awardea tribal hospitality and then told to go away and not make speeches.The beginning of his tenure of office here has been in line with what could be expected,as all teachers have received notificatiin that if they do not toe the party line they can get out, and quickly.Following this gentle persuasion there are fairly well substantiated rumours that all the teachers have agreed to hold a demonstration with their pupils in favour of the M new time religion M and have telegraphed to the Ministry of Education in Tehran asking for more funds ana teachers to open schools in the outlying villages to save the ululating sons of Ali for true democracy,This process has actually begun since Alavi, in his capacity of supervisor of endowment lands, has selected Barnaj and Bisitun to open the campaign, and has promised night classes for adults-after the harvest has been garnered and winnowed, as it were.He has also sent a Tudeh representative to head the school at Harsin, hitherto an anti-Tudeh stringhold. It need scarcely be mentioned that his his anglophobe and russonhil predilections seriously handicap all attempts to reach’the schools and children by true blue British propaganda, such as films,even when the electricity works.In fact teachers of English are being removed elsewhere or dismissed so that children may not be poisoned by the language of imperialists, and the study of Russian is being advocated. Tudeh headquarters have been decorated gaily recently with some of the more poisonous extracts from the worst of the Tehran oapers, a gesture of friendliness no doubt towards the power that built the only good road in the whole difetrict and employed all the labour that could be provided. ' A black snake' was one of the more striking references to ourselves in an address given by ur. Sheki to his disciples on the occasion of the arrival of the new Governor-General. Furtner activity has extended to the opening of a new Tudeh headquarters in Taq-i-dostan, and the fomentation of trouble in Asadabad.Equally easy has been their assertion to the peasants of the district that the proposed reduction by 15/o of the amount paid to landowners has been entirely due to the efforts of the Party, and that further benefits will be forthcoming if only they will play ball. They have held a political play in Mermanshah for three nights after the authorities had been bullied into granting the iqecessary pe mit, Alavi is said to be gunning for the newspaper ' Mermanshah ' in order to leave the field open to the Party organ ' Bisitun '. It is scarcely worth mentioning that calls have not been excha ged between H. ..Acting-Consul and Mr. Alavi. who enjoys the company of the Russians in various places including the Bisitun hotel.TRIBAL: 3 EXT 6498 The immediate effect of thd PrimejMinister 's announcement that Iranians should avoid contact with foreign representatives has been the reduction of the number of ^ callers at the Consulate, All tribal chiefs have been receiv ing from the O.C. Troops letters stating that their loyalty towards their country was not in question but that the Prime Minister had made his announcembnt and it would be better to carry out his wishes, and best way to do that was for the tribal chiefs to go back to their tribes without paying any calls on foreign representatives. It is not known if similar letters were sent to the Tudeh leaders and if the word M foreigner' is applicable to the Russian Consul in the same way as to the British, Suffice it to say that the Kussian calling list, whether by the front or by the back door, is much more difficult to deal with than the British callers who have only a front door. The wand, weak as it was, which we could wave and which the previous Ustandar had encouraged us to hold onto quietly, has been snatched away, and this fact has escaped no one’s attention. Actual events that have taken place have been the removal of the Bakhshdar of Guran on the flimsiest of pretexts and the subsequent removal of the Bakhshdar of Ravansar. These moves were at once brought to the notice of the Consulate and support was expected as the two persons involved had been on the British lines of communication during the war and had co-operated with the British for years. Enquiries were made of the Ustandar, whose reactions are described below. There is substantial evidence that these moves, coupled with the rumour that Asghar Khan (para 1) is hoping for a strong position in the Senjabi, are due to the machinations of Dr Kerim Khan Senjabi, who wishes to prepare the way carefully for the acceptance of his candidature for the forthcoming Majlis. Latest confirmation came from Amir Makhsus Qubadian, leader of the Kalhur, who has been in Kermanshah for some ten days or more, trying to find some way to sustain his claim to all the land he can possibly take or hold from all comers, including his uncle, Daoudian. He had tried by devious methods to get an interview with the Acting Consul without having to come to the Consulate, but finally decided to disregard the letter from the ChC. Troops and to pay his respects. During the two hours that he did so his conversation was directed to asking why the British were not doing some tiling about the situation in the country, and declaring that he remained as ever a true friend of Britain, who was just waiting for the word to put his talents and organisation at our disposal. He pointed out, correctly, that the situation had deteriorated greatly, and there was danger in the West, and that the time might well come when our friends would be unable to visit the Consulate and pass on information. At such a time we should remember that he had been our true ally and had issued a warning. Three times he asked ’’will you help and support the tribes, or are you unable to dox so?” Evasion was immediately practised on a large scale, consisting for the most part of a lecture on the relationship of a Consul towards H.M. Embassy and the Government of the country to which he had been assigned. Finally Qubadian remarked with great perspicacity that, as he could not obtain a direct answer to his question he supposed that in fact we were unable to help the tribes, but did not wish to say so in case we lost contacts and influence? a remark that raised him in the estimation of his listeners. /It islas not for a long time I£ is just worth noting! th^ a iunK been attacked by the eifejitun payer, trfet nothing has been S ntort-inL h t-n v i S e t . to j t v e Consulate j and that it was he who entertained the Tuden members at 'his headquarters.

He said that there was no likelihood of the Homala extending their influence in his area, although tentative approaches had been made. Shortly after his call, however.a t +. came in Mustafa had designs on that part of Aurdistan.No news of any fighting has come through. GOVERNOR*GSNEHAL: t? u?? early yet to form an exact appreciation Mr* Ahmad Sallahi’s Qualities and leanings since his tenure of The f e . fire &gt; however, certain indications which might well be taken into account.At his first call he took the opportunity to asK for the Consulate's cooperation with the Iranian.officials and for free discussions of questions of mutual interest, adding that during his term of office as gxxmxmsx rarmandar he had relied greatly on the tribal knowledge possessed by the British Consulate. He also stated that he woula not^allow disturbances of the peace by any oolitical oartv and tnat ne would ao wnat ne could to put a stop to anti- Hritisn propaganua. In spite of the telegrams sent from Aermansnah opposing his appointment he was sure he would win tue popularity he enjoyed in Ramadan, from 'where tne people did not want him to leave. As against the above the hI? v Uv '’ lag a f s since he arrived: two Bakhshdars whom me hau promised to support have been removed: his avowed intention to support Ansani against Alavi as director of i/aucation was eitner allowed to lapse under pressure or of no avail: anti-^ntish pronouncements have not diminished: he is reported to frequent almost exclusively Asghar Khan's house; he throws his weight about by losing his tenner. He aaa ^ ow fs^ea for our support in removing Colonel Shahenda, O.C.iersian troops, on the grounds that the latter is acting on nis own and aisregarding the Governor-General. .. 4 a recent interview about the general situation m u yi s ^ r i c ^ said that he was not receiving helo from lehran where his telegrams and despatches were disregarded and unanswered;that he was being bypassed completely by the ^ war Office in Tehran with regard to the removal of Bakhshdars and that the letters which were being sent to the tribal chiexs were sent by the 0 # C.troops and not by himself. He added that he had received no instructions from Tehran about the proposed reduction of the share to be oaid by peasants to landowners, and that the Tudeh had taken the wireless announcement as sufficient directive to warrant their ^cinr around all the villages and informing the peasants.With regard bo the rumour that /tlavi was going to hold a demonstration of students, he stated that he was powerless to prevent it witibout ris-i oi bloodshed. In fact he was despondent, and openly declared tnat he was being disregarded by the Tudeh the editor of the Blsitun. .

KERMANSHAHs There was little to illuminate the chronicle of the past month until the news from Shiraz began to trickle through. Although almost nothing is certainly known about events there, seventy members of the Tudeh party have decided that the attractions of its programme are as nothing compared with the maintainance of their necks in the proper position, and resigned on hearing that numbers of the party had been hanged publicly in Shiraz. To mortify the faithful still further th° landowners and some tribesmen of the entire region have form-. 1 an organisation with a committee and proper officers to combat the activities of the Tudeh party among their peasants and to warn them that if the landowners are not given their legal share the peasants will be deprived of tools and seed next year with the result that food will be scarce and prir^- prohibitive. Considerable importance is attached to the agricultural position next year ? when it is feared that internal stresses and strains will result in smaller produc tivity, This organisation, v/hich began as a limited body, ba now developed political tendencies and numbers some two hundred or more persons of influence who are bent on counter ing the Tudeh party. The British are generally believed to be behird events in Shiraz and our reputation has risen in consequence.tit 'SECHET Despatch No 27 to F.0. &amp; No 22 to Tehran, KERMANSHAH MONTHLY DIARY October 1946 ^ KERMANSHAH: , , SHAMS MOLK ARA (Shahab-ud-Dowleh K C V 0 ) « replaced AHMAD SALLAIil as Governor-General of the Vth Ustan. to Meshed as^hirector'of Ffnanc^^ IS ‘ &lt;ANDARI &gt; who S-e ALAVI has been in Tehran for some time it -»o EdScationfMaMI? 3 ' bS rePlaCSd by the former director of TRIBAL: district during L pr ? m ™ ne ^ i ndlvidual ^roughodt the entire ais^nct; darrng the last month has undoubtedly be-n 0UBAD1MN This position was somewhat forcibly thrust upon him by'the wireless of an article in the Daily Telegraph otating. that it had long been possible for Qubadian to capture P Kermanshah and the erroneous report by Reuters that Kermfnshlh ad in fact been captured by the tribes.

The latest report is that the question of the settlement of the lands has been taken up with the proper Ministry with a request for favourable consideration for Qubadian, At the time of writing attention has been distracted from the security situation to the impending elections. KURDISTAN: During a visit-to Sanandaj it was ascertained from the Governor there that disturbances were infrequent, and that the departure of Hama Rashid to Iraq had had a good effect on the tribes and should be followed if possible by the grant of a pardon to mullah Mustafa s6 cnat he could remove both himself and nis followers. _It ..appears that the tribes round Mahabad and feeling, slightly disillusioned by ,the general situation, and are displaying less enthusiasm for an autonomous Kurdistan than previously. They still maintain an arbitrary customs check and search all Persian Army vehicles and make themselves unpleasant to officers and men, doing everything they can to diminish the prestige of the Persian Army. It is reported that there are upwards of 6000 troops in and around Saqqiz who have put up with this effrontery for want of orders to the contrary. The Governor hopes ^ that with quiet handling the fires will receive no kindling and will be easily controlled. For this reason and because of the general unrest throughout the country he is strongly opposed to the holding of the elections in the near future and hopes that the Prime Minister for. whom he expresses^lreat admiration as he does detestation of the Russians, will be able to postpone them for some months yet, G OVERNORS-GENERAL.: The speedy departure of the unhappy Sallahi was a loss to.noone except possibly to the Russian Consulate and its sympathisers. The deterioration in the district luring his tenure of office was as remarkable for its spee * as for i*$ wto€ coverage and could only have come about through weakness of administration coupled with a disregard for sins of ommission as well as of commission.' Bhahab-ud-Dowleh, the new Governor-General, is a patriarchal and aristocratic genxleman, K.C.V.O., wno speaks English we11.and loudly, and In .5 spent many years in England. As Governor in Kurdistan he achieved a reputation for efficient administration and knowledge.of tribal matters, which a tendency to venality failed to dim.

The Governor-General holds the view that such a policy is ultimately to our advantage as it can be applied to the Russian Consulate equally well.Information has become increasingly hard to acquire but the imminence of the elections may result in an increase in the number of callers who still cannot believe that non-interference is our policy. Already there are indications that the Ola Guard are lining up to ascertain the views ofae British Consulate, and wits ana tongues are being sharpened for the important business of misconstruing •within reason whatever may be said. \ RUSSIAN ACTIVITIES: The Russian Consul celebrated the Revolution with some local vodka and some specks of caviar. As the occasio had to be enjoyed by everyone, especially the Iranians, it might be described as a successful party by wishful thinkers. A deputation of Iranians, including members of the Oil Company, we to the Governor-General to enquire if they should accept the invitation in view of the Prime Minister's edict, and were told that it would be inadvisable hot to go. The British Consul was informed confidentially that it would be unlikely that the Iranians would turn up for an official British party in such for as they were not afraid o f us. T&amp;e Governor-General made a speech which was applauded and lauded by all sections of the Iranians who were present, recalling the Moslem and French Revolutions, the part that Iran had played in the war as a ’•bridge of victory' for the Allies and stating that she had ropayed in full the support andhelp she had received from them. It was time that Iran should be allowed to manage her own affair and maintain friendly relations with the three great powers. Ths Governor-General evidently decided that he should do something for the occasion of the moment so toasts were drunk. No reply wa made by the Russian. A second speui&gt;h made by the Governor-General when the Russian Consul-hatf'a special film showing of -;nd gruesome war Xilm,quite unauther.tic ,but which V'with applause by the claqueurs in the audience^ Tn- this speech he drew attention to the heroism of the Russia^ pt^o-ple as depicted in trie film and hoped the people of Iran wouJ-&lt;Jue prepared to defend their country as bravely against any^nemy and regardless of the political in power. He then turned round and loudly asked the Acting British Consul when he would have the pleasure of seeing a British film, \ The third opportunity he took of having a dig at the Russians • in public was ata small reception when foreign representatives h$d xjlk been invited in full dress and the Russian Consul had hot complied.^ He was asked why he had not appeared in full dress in accordance with the terms of the invitation. _ . The Russian Consul has also made hityself known in the smaller toims such aa^-Qaar-i-Bhirin, Karind, and Bhahabad, and is endeavouring to x obtaih Permission to ooen a big branch of the Russo-Iranian Cultural Society. The Governor-General approached the Acting ^British Consul with a request that H.M. Embassy be encouraged to ooen a branch of the Anglo-Iranian Society as a counterbalance and also to establish some cultural centre in a region which Britain could not afford to allow anyone else to dominate. When in due/ course2* coux’S '3 Ad was informed of the negative answer given to this (g&gt; proposal he was astonished and dismayed since it seemed a matter of great importance. We would not always have a friendly uovernor-Genoral prepared to defend our intests and to let iranir^s know that it was to their interest to have a strong Britain in the West. An indication of coming events may be given by a leading article in hahbar which was later broadcast in full from Moscow radio in Persian, fhis article is directed principally against hobertson, the Manager of the ivermanshah Petroleum Company, wno is accused of being head of the Intelligence Service here and of dictating to everyone including the British Consul. Thir latter individual comes in for a fair share of crime apparentl -. ihe British Consul, who openly intimidates the people by incx isKnoie imprisonment, exile and murder, is one of the students of Robertson's school' and ' openly interferes in all local affairs and has lately increased his shameless activities to such an extent that he resorted to means and excuses to suppress the Bisitun newspaper,'It is probable that this article was written in Tehran by a former writer in the Bisitun paper. Both Rahbai and the Bisitun are sufficiently friendly with the Russians tc warrant suspicion of the inspiration of the article. TRIBAL: News of the intrigues and the jockeying for position between tribes in this area, which three or four months ago it was part and parcel of the day's work to hear, has ceased. It appears,however, from reports that the tribal chiefs in the West have assured both the Governor and the Prime Minister of their active.support in any conflict with the Azerbaijan democrats or their northern neighbours. Tnese loyal chiefs extend as fa.* as Baqqiz, where the situation is in hand and the threat to Sardasht, the gateway to Rermanshah and the entire West, has been fended off. In Northern Kurdistan Mullah Mustafa and Qaz: Mchamed have convened in Mahabad with the Komala and the trib&gt; s o. Azerbaijan, after the Mullah's return from Russia, tohere he is said to have been given support in men ana arms. There is disouiet over events in Azerbaijan ana a feeling that there will be considerable resistance to Iranian troops, inspired by hhe ^uj.sians, and that it will be hard for the Prime minister to carry the matter through. The Javanrudi are reported to have gone into the mountains to meet a representative of the Komala. They are in an area where many thousands of cartridges, unmarked, and fitting Brno and Parabellum weapons, have found their way. ELECTIONS: Considerable activity has been displayed bb the lead*r^ of the Democrat Party who have visited Qubadian and other chiefs of tribes in this region. They have also not spared their efforts to win over to their cause the leading landowners and have resorted to wiles and threats to do so. No official information about the elections apoears to have been received by the GoVernor-Gen ral who is doubtful if they will be held in view of the Azerbaijan question.In the landowners’ organisation at the moment it is each man for himself, and it is probable that for this reason one of the best men will not be chosen. Dr. Kerim Senjabi has come from Tehran tc further his candidature and has held interviews witn Qubadian and ohher tribal leaders. The Russian Consul was anxious to know where he was. It is said that the Prime minister told Earmanfarmayan, the local leader of th Democrat Party, that Qubadian and the two most influential landowners in the district would not be elected. / MOVEMENTS:MOVEMENTS: H M Acting'Consul visited Hamadan, Bagdad, and Tehran during the month- ^ J Russian Consul visited Hamadan, Qasr-i-Shirin, iWmd and Bhahabad- ’ HAMADAN i Colcnea.

Apart fran the elec tions nothing of importance has happened in this area during the last month. Manoeuvres send tactics were practised by all the candidates and various soundings taken of public opinion, me only notable result of this was the disappearance fiom ohe list of candidates of the leader oi rhe local Democrat Party, Manucher Farm'nfurmayan, whose views aid person were not looked on with favour. After a final bid for public opinion he publ shed a document asking die populace to vote for his frierds and then departed, according to instructions, to Tehran. Aiother whofell b}^ the wayside was Dr. Zanganeh, a. deputy in. the former Maples, who also decided that he atmosphere was unpropitious and left for Theran. He thus followed the example of another former Deputy, Sasan, who left some time ago having ascertainc d that his cause was hopeless. Those left in nhe field were -ubadian, Rafat-us-Saltaneh PafLliszi, Asia Za:iganeh, Dr, Moavin, Allaneh, and Hay at i, while there were one or two minor candidates who were determined to their luck, he elections lasted five days and there seems little doubt that they will go to the candidates who had the longest purse behind them. A triumvirate of the first three named appears to have been formed, as they were always arm in arm on their way from mosque to mosque.ho doubt Pallizzi, who is far xrom popular, has extended credit to the impecunious tub ad i an as a cuid pro ouo for his tribal votes. Pour polling stations were chosen i:. different raoscues and all were thronged with Kurdish villagers, Many of those were unk own to the authorities and by means of the sejels of their deceased relatives and friends succeeded in voting several times during the first day. next day two mosques were allo tted to the villagers and ’two to the townsmen in an of ort to obvia.te the difficulty experienced by the less hardy in attaining the polling room througli the throngs of Kurds.

Allameh on the other hand came to appeal na the Consulate to have the electio rannulled on account of such methods, his men being unable to vote. The crowds were good-humoured a.id treated thu whole matter as a joke which cost them /nothing2 , nothing whatever it cost their lords and masters. ■ hose wh /''through did so by dint of walking over the heads of the crowd and hurling themselves at the police who generally let them fall on the'right side for the voting box. In the mos'ucs for the townsmen much the same scenes V were encated and an energetic time was had by all. In at least one mosque the ingenuous villagers were persudded to hand their voting papers to the trustworthy inspectors who stood around the box and were told that they had done their duty and could depart. There is no evidence available of tampering with the boxes, though that would be easier in the small outlying towns where six other polling stations were set up and candidates were not themselves co the fore. When further details come to hand there ma^r be some interesting revelations of democratic voting 'methods. The elections in Sanandaj are expected to take place in a week and to last from twenty to thirty days, depending to the weather. The ex-Governor, Ascf, adopts a despotic attitude cowards proceedings and wishes the other successful candidates to be carbon copies of himself and to be men with a stake in that part of the country. Fortunately he is well-disposed towards British policy and has been instrumental in keeping the peace in his area. British Consulate Kermanshah 3rd February 1247 (Sd.) H. N. PULLAR Distribution as before.r' mm KERMANSHAH MONTHLY . DIARY February 1947. APPOINTMENTS: A3DUL ATOUF RIAHI to be Head of the Justice Dept. ELECTIONS: The four successful candidates were Qubadian, Dr. Mo r aven, Aziz Zanganeh and Rafat-as-Saltaneh. The elections have been declared legal and valid and complaints from disappointed rivals made in Tehran and Kermanshah have been considered and answered by the inspectors. Chief complainant was Allameh, head of the Adalat party and anathema to the Tudeh, who lost fourth place by a narrow margin to Rafat-as-Saltaneh and who alleges that the Governor-General was heard issuing instructions by telephone to two Farmandars that votes should not be given to Allameh and that they must be changed when counting took place if they had been given. On the basis of this report, the strong Democrat hue of the inspection board, and other supposed infringements of proper voting procedure, Allameh le^t for Tehran to lay his case before H.I.M. the Shah and the Prime Minister. Counting of the votes took place in one of the mosques in Kermanshah and at each station to which a box had been allocated in the outlying districts. No great exitement was evident and the imported villagers departed without incident. Interviews with Qubadian and Dr. Mo’aven have shown that they adopt an optimistic attitude towards the granting of an oil concession to Russia, believing that enough opposition can be mustered to prevent such a proposal becoming law. A difference of opinion between them manifested itself over the Prime Minister's position. Qubadian thought he would resign his premiership and retain his seat as deputy in^order to avoid censure that would be passed on him for any illegal measures he may have taken during the last year. Dr. Mo’aven's view was that Qavam was too fond of power to take such a step voluntarily and that he would command sufficient support to have his unconsti tutional acts annulled. They both agreed that the conflict had reached serious proportions but that with the backing of the army the Shah had consolidated his position and would have less fears of any aspirations Qavam might have for a Republic. With regard to local affairs, Qubadian felt that the.order issued for the disarming of the tribes was unrmssary since they had caused the Government no anxiety in this region. In view of his activities and designs in the summer of last year he must have had his tongue placed firmly in his cheek. Dr. Mo'ven considered that an active policy of social, economic, health and educational reforms would be the Government's best way of maintaining its position in the country. Corrupt officials, of whom the Governor- General was the leader, must be removed as soon as possible. /LOCAL:I: ■' 'v A ** 2 - LOCAL! A theatrical performance was held club to celebrate the return of s me troops from Kurdistan.

A serious fire in Nehavand caused damage estimated at Rls 20,000,000.

Troops went personally to visit the chiefs of the tribes. Consequently &lt; *orda i of infantry has been despatch ed to relieve them of ir ifles. A representative of the Lahuni called to ask the advice of the British Con with regard to handing over their rifles, and embel d his case by stating that / one- 2 1876 19 one of the chiefs of the tribe had gone to H. — M* Embassy for the same purpose, A question of honour was involved apart from expediency as the Persian Army would declare that the tribe had handed over its rifles under pressure '''“'‘If no resistance were made, and no 100$ Lahuni would stand that. It was suggested that the example of the Waladbegi should be followed and a notice published in the papers that the arms would be surrendered willingly to the O.C. Troops. This recommendation was carried out. The Director of Firamee went to Tehran to ask if the rations of sugar and tea theoretically destined for the tribesmen of the area should be delivered to the chiefs of the tribes who did not distribute them, but obtained large profits by their sale. It is unlikely that his moral objections will carry any weight for reasons explained later in this diary. The Russian Consul visited the Ilam area during the month. AGRICULTURE: Landowners have had a good harvest with high prices. Although the proportion of the crops taken over by the Government is not highly paid, the remainder finds its way down to Qasr-i-Shirin and Khanaqin and is sold at very Inflated prices as a result of the shortage in Iraq. TUDEH: The revival of this party has begun under the auspices of the Russian Voks office. Cinema shows are given from time to time, the standard-bearer 'Bisitun M has started one or two articles in the old style, and some forty members of the Kermanshah Petroleum Company have rejoined the party. It is hardly surprising^if it achieves some degree of success in view of the prevailing corruption. BEGGAR MY NEIGHBOUR: The following information has been obtained from various sources and is given to show why the people might prefer a strong Shah or Communist doctrine to what they have. Kermanshah has often been described as the worst town of any size in Iran apart from the South. It has no redeeming features, no aspiring buildings* and until the last month, practically no main street. Its inhabitants are said to be among the scruffiest. But there is one good thing which Kermanshah has, even though others may share that grace and that is the perquisites of office. Given the appeal of the town of Karmanshah, the restricted society, and the doubtful length of his stay the gentl^an official can have only one object - to retrieve the amount which ne in all probability paid for his post, and make enough for his next down payment and his material comfort. No unusual acumen is required to observe that his opinionsare dhared by.a surprising nuteber of obviously charming and intelligent persons who have realised at once that nothing can be done for suen dreadful town or its equally obnoxious inhabitants, and that the best way to see that public money is not wasted is to have it, and as much ill-gotten private gam as possible, put into the custody of those who are capable of knov/ing a good thing when they see it. This high civic mind- /edne ss- 3 - Alness and determination to see thalj ,mp(iey is net uselessly squandered on or by those who are top poor to ben^i therefrom has been instanced in a v|£i 6 tyofcaies. His Honour the Mayor, JEHANSHAHI, Has concludea bargains with the bakers» butchers and fruit sellers y which they may sell at a price above the average, or course ^such service is not with a smile only, and it costs each ^ N an His 50 a day for the Mayor. But the Mayor had to pay ^ ^_s 20,000 for his post, supposedly to the Governor-General, and pays a daily impot himself. Die* in nnn a The Head of the Gendarmerie gets Rls 10,000 a month from his colleague in Qasr-i- 3 hirin for allowing him to take as many bribes as he can. Six other officers from different towns are acting likewise ~ geneially in co-operation with the police, bakhshdar, and some other official - and paying from Rls 2,000 to 1^00 a Rls 35,000 a month are paid by Mohammad Beg Lahuni ior receiving the salaries of the gendarmes employed in the Auroman area, and the Javanrudis pay Rls 1^000. The Police Department cannot of course be out done and the Chief received his due M to keep up with the Browns next door M from the office in charge of ?? that the latter can levy fines on each bus and taxi leaving Kermanshah. ~ The poor young rich are in the maws of the Conscription Department which seduces them - no hard task and indulges in the added pleasures of blac. mailing them every six months or so. The tribesmen pay -and then are listed as deserters. The O.C. Troops is beloved to turn his blind eye to this practice - and blindness is always ' expensive. Tea and sugar rations destined for the soldiers and tribesmen are sold by the officers and chie s, w o f&amp;y well for the monopoly. In this connexion another young department has unexpectedly winning ways, and that is h Census Department, the difficulty of certifying.to the number of persons in the tribes who should receive tea and qurar can only be overcome by a rich uncle. Visiting chief- tains are kept in their place until they realise how heinous is the offence of not bringing burnt offerings to the highes . Tobacco and opium are clearly the Scylla and Charybdis of their growers, but the craft can be steered clear at a cost they are willing to pay. Wheat, unfortunately, shows a great tendency to be adulterated with dirt and becomes earthy- a serious fault involving blood-money of some fifteen to twen y p Malcontents who ma y have the effrontery and ignorance not to see that these matters work better when done bv a team* and who take the case indignantly - court for luqtice may perhaps find Justice too dazzled to see their point $ view. The P sca!e! must fall from Justice's eyes. If you want zood service you must pay for it. good * system as practised with such success, from the highest official to the lowest, cannot but have an attrac tion for the rest of the populace who wish to emulate and beUer their superiors, and, taking it by and large, their attitude is not altogether surprising. British Consulate, KERMANSHAH, August 12th, 1947* DISTRIBUTION: As for previous diaries. (Sd) H.N.PULLAR■mm*.KERMANSHAH SECRET MONTHLY DIARY i — August 1947 * O ‘ — */ D j il / / BRITISH INTERESTS: ' On^the second of August H. M. Acting Consul visited Kalsafid to deliver a letter of thanks and apprec iation from H. M. Ambassador to AMJADI who donated fifty gold coins for flood relief in the United Kingdom. Amjadi has a record of friendliness towards the IJ K. going back to pre-war days and was very harassed last year by the Tudeh Party. As there is always trouble of one sort or another in his neighbourhood, it is unders^andable but regrettable that he has decided to move his residence to Tehran. 13th August. Members of a Miles Aircraft 1 plane who had left Tehran and were proceeding to Airman came down in Kermanshah for the night. As their aircraft had not been given a permit to leave the ground, and in fact had not been signalled to the military authorities here, the party was detained until the Consulate persuaded the O.C. Troops to let it go. 15th August. A party for some seventy or eighty * persons was given at the Consulate on the occasion of the celebration of Pakistan. The British colony, Iranian officials, American mission, foreign Consuls and one or two Indians were invited. All but two of the American Mission were absent or had forgotten. Of the two who came one observed openly that Pakistan had taken its freedom and had not received it. The Russian Consul and Vice Consul drove up to the front door and drove away again without ringing the bell or trying to enter, although Iranians were arriv ing. When asked later for an explanation the Russian Consul replied that as the front door was shut he thought he had come on the v/rong day. The date and ti$e had been advertised in the papers and special invitations sent out. The occasion and speeches received prominent notice in the local press, and many favourable comments among the Iranian officials were heard about the establishment of Pakistan as a separate Dominion, 18th August. Between 7.30 and 8*30 p.m* the house of the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran was broken into and the children’s nurse stripped and bound, before the cries of a child frightened the two intruders- The manager and his wife were in the assistant’s house in the same compound not more than a hundred yards away. T a police have been working hard on the case and many suspect have been brought forward for identification but withou uccess. In spite of constant pressure from the Consulate and the Bank it appears unlikely that there will now be an arrest. There were several curious aspects in the case. 28th August. H. M. Ambassador arrived from Tehran. The journey was originally going to have taken place by air, but a last-minute hindrance obliged Plis Excellency to come by road if the journey was to be accomplished at all. Accordingly His Excellency left Tehran at midnight and arrived in Kermanshah just after 11 a.m. Calls were paid /on- 2 - 61 r j t $ on the new Governor-General, and at 12.15 two Krng’s Medals were presented to members of the Oil Company-at the Consular Residence during a small reception. The British colony assembled at the Oil Company for lunch and were introduced. In the evening a dinner and dance w$s given at the Consulate. On the following day, the Governor-General gave a lunch party for Iranians and British, and left at 4.00 p.m. with the Ambassador and H. M. Acting Consul for Hamadan. On the 30th His Excellency inspected British establishments and interestxs in Hamadan and left for Tehran in the afternoon. IRANIAN MOVEMENTS: SHAHAB-ud-DOV/LEH has been replaced as Governor- General by Sardar Akram. .Rumours had been prevalent for some time about the departure of the former Governor-General, both on account of age and of taking bribes. His attitude towards the British was always friendly and correct, and suspicions that he veered slightly to the left at the end of his tenure of office had no foundation^ Under constant Soviet pressure he tried to establish a fair modus oper- andi by balancing a British request against a Soviet demand. Although he. may have been rather fearful of the central authorities there are many who regret his departure both as a man and as an aristocrat from another age. SARDAR AKRAM is almost too well-known to require a-ny introduction. Having failed to become a deputy for Hamadan he has become Governor-General of the Vth Ustan. Neither he nor anyone else believes he will stay long, and he openly talks of going to Shiraz next spring if he &lt; can get over the first three months here. He is already in the process of spending all the money he hopes.to make out of his office in Kermanshah. He may prove too friendly to the British for the Russians to swallow, but if he can retain office during the oil concession talks he may do something to quash false rumours. Full of good intentions he hopes to win the good-will of the people by supplying them with better water, electricity and roads. He also has plans to keep wheat from filtering through to Iraq by allowing_each producer to export half a ton of rice to Iraq on condition that he brings a ton of wheat to the Government here. Etela'at has published a telegram from the notables of Hamadan against his appointment as Governor-General and the Setareh Gharb has also voiced opposition. DARVISH has arrived as Mayor from Ahwaz. Shaikh ABDUL KARIM ZENJANI, an important Shiite ulema stayed in Kerind for two weeks and was received with great courtes±y by all the Iranian officials. SARHADDAR has been.appointed Governor of Qasr-i-Shirin and has been replaced in Shahabad by KHOSRO QUBADIAN. The former Governor of Qasr i-Shirin, SHERIFI, is expected to come to Kermanshah as assistant Governor to replace KHAQANI,. GENERAL: There is no curiosity about the fom th deputy. It is rumoured that several persons are paying 'arge sums in Tehran to achieve that office. The sums must be large as one of the richest landowners stated that he could not /affordafford to enter the lists. Most of the talk about town concerns the Northern Oil Agreement and the concensus is that the Russian proposal will be turned down and that the Soviet Union will then take counter action which may lead to war between the Powers with Iran as the loser* There is some hope that the United States and Britain will be able to stop a war but on the whole Russia is considered as to© stupid to refrain from rushing mnto action. It should of course be stated that public opinion in this area is neither extensive not vocal, RAMADAN: It is reported from Ramadan that the proprietor of the Iran Hotel there was induced by the Russian Consul in Kermanshah to act as agent for the distribution of Russian publicity material^ A great deal of the material was unsold and the proprietor is now being asked by the Russian Consul to pay for it all. The Tudeh Party are said to be holding regular meetings at their club. Several refugee families stated to have been thrown out of Russia have arrived in Ramadan. British Consulate, (Sd) H.N.PULLAR KERMANSHAH, September 4th, 1947. DISTRIBUTION: As beforei. This was brought to me by Colonel Bellamy, '.far Staff, who had spoken to South East Asia Department on General Smith's suggestion that this Diary should not have so wide a distribution. I told Mr. Allen (and Colonel Bellamy who afterwards saw me about it) that while this was a matter for the Foreign uffice to decide as the post at Kermanshah is now entirely theirs, I tnought that distribution should now not be given to any Indian authority but that copies might be sent to the U.K. High Commissioners in New Delhi and Karachi leaving them discretion to pass on ary interesting item to trie Governments concerned. Ife do not seem to have nad copies from the Eastern Department since August but perhaps you could speak to them on these lines and suggest Tehran accordingly. \ U* structions being sent to ^ ,/K 6.11.47. it, ^ (?

On the 4th September he visited the Kalhur tribe* seat of AMIR MAXESUS, ABBAS QUBADIAN, and asked them why they did not wear their tribal dress. He later confided that the tribe was not worth much these days. In the middle of the month he went to outlying parts of the Vth Ustan and ’S^enly left for Tehran, whence he returned on the 2 btn. ills house had been burgled and some valuable carpets stolen, so he was able to combine personal with official business. He has imparted various bits of information which appear in this diary. Qubadian's brother, KHOSRO, has replaced SARHAD- DAR as Governor of Shahabadv Although this is a very small town, it is the centre of a considerable tribal area, and tile head of the largest tribe now represents the Government. Sarhaddar. who has been well-disposed towards the British has been transferred to Qasr-i-Ghirin, on the Iraqi-Iran frontier, as Governor. General SHAHANDEH, O.C. Troops has been called to iehran. There is a rumour that he will be replaced. Colonel AHANIN, Chief of the Gendarmerie, has been removed on account of bribery and corruption and ineff iciency. He. was to have been replaced by Colonel KAIKAVOUSI who, however, could not remain. It is expected that Colonel BAGHERI will come. He has the reputation of being pro-Tudeh, but reliable authority states that it is undeserved. One gordan of infantry was sent to Tabriz at the start of the' month. FOREIGN: Mr KAMAL JAWAD has replaced Mr TAI, who has gone to Aleppo as Iraqi Consul. Mr Jawad was last in Khorrarashahr. TRIBAL: Several sources have declared that the Javanrudis have been causing trouble in their area, both to other tribes and to the twon of Rowansir, which they have robbed to good purpose. This tribe has all along been unwilling to hand in its rifles, and such as have been returned to the Persians are reputed to be old unserviceable weapons brought from Iraq, while the good rifles remain in the tribesmen's hands.. Khosro, the.new Governor of Shahabad, was aske’d to use his powers of diplomacy, which in his opinion are considerable, to restore the peace between the Javanrudi and the small pockets of troops stationed around Ravansir. He is sure he has succeeded. It is also reported by various sources that the Russian•Vice- Consul was in the Javanrud area and saw the chief of the tribe. This report is probably accurate. The Lahunis continue to walk in fear of the Javanrudis. A road has been built from Shahabad to Gavareh, leading into the Senjabi and Guran tribes. It is in good condition and is used for military purposes. ECONOMIC: The Governor-General has had the courage to make decisions on his own, and, tired of the dilly-dallying in /Tehran- 3 - f EXT /.j i, '^ b * i Uq Kermanshah to start to repair the difficulties would be ironed out later, join up with a new maidan opposite where the construction of the wall nay to take action which has been contem- Tehran, telegraphed to roads immediately, and Work has begun and may the consular compound, force the municipality plated since 1941., It is reported that Alexander Gibb will examine the possibility of renewing or improving the Kermanshah electricity plant. There has been a riot in Qasr-i-Shirin where officials have allowed, in return for bribes, wheat to leave the town and pass into Iraq. The townspeople are very short of bread, and broke the municipality windows. As the wheat comes from Kermanshah the Governor-General has sent a commission to investigate the matter. ELECTIONS: It is believed that Dr ZANGANEH, deputy in the last Majles, is the Shah’s choice as Dr Mo’aven’s replace ment. There are five other candidates, however, and the Governor-General’s views differ. He has said tnat he will try and keep the elections free as long as the wrong man does not have a chance of success.’ LOCAL: The Russo-Iranian Cultural Society was formally opened on the 7 th September. No British were invited. The President of the Society is Dr DAFTARI, Director of Health, a person of dubious virtue. One of his assistants is HOSSEIN ZANGANEH, definitely pro-T udeh. The Kermanshah Petroleum Company has held sports for its labourers. This is the first time such an event has occurred and during the last month, when preliminary heats were being run off enthusiasm was considerable. Many prizes were given as a result of a grant of Rls 10,000/- from Abadan, and the winner of the six kilometre race from Taq-i-Bostan to the Kermanshah refinery received Rls 2,500/-. It is hoped that this will become an annual event and divert attention from soap-box orators. It was certainly very successful this year. RAMADAN: The Russian Vice-Consul visited Ramadan and spent three days there. He is believed to have returned some of the se.1 u 1 s of the Armenians who had registered for emigration to Soviet Armenia last year. He went to the British reading room and asked the attendants if they were satisfied with their wages, and if there were fresh plans for improvement. ABBAS ISKANDARI, deputy for Ramadan, has succeeded through HASSAN EGHBALI in restoring some of the former Tudeh officials to their posts* British Consulate, (Sd) H.N.PULLAR KERMANSHAH, October 1 st, 1947.
