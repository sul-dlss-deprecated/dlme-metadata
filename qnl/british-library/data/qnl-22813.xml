V - J y /our letter C/Q 56 of 22nd September. 2- 1 have once egein put to the Sheikh the suggestion that he should send ? proper representative to the Jedda con ference. He still does not wish to do so. for the ssme rea sons as those he advanced before, namely Ihat there is nobody he can trust not to do as much harm r as good, and that there is in any case nobody who knows- anything about it. I am in clined to share his views on this head. If whoever w'ent were to contribute as little as he and Salih do when discussing the question w r ith me, Qatar’s case would fare poorly. 6. I have sppken with Mohammed bin Sa’id at Hajiri, who is of course quite illiterate and unable to relate his knowledge to a map, but who is not unintelligent, and seems to know what he is talking about. His principal value is that he is said to have given evidence at a previous official enquiry, of which there are presumably records, and (accord ing to the Sheikh and Salih) his evidence was not disputed at that time. The records would show whether this was so or not. He appears to have been accepted by Ibn Sa’ud as an expert on the subject, and Aramco are reported to have tried to get him to define the frontiers for them. This is of course not evidence of anything at all, but he does seem to be a res pected character whose presence at Jedda would be useful, he is less likely to contradict himself, if he goes on his own, than he is to be contrsdicted if he is accompanied, by any of the available M experts” here. 4. The attitude which Salih and the Sheikh adopt is i that the boundary between Qatar and Saudi Arabia is not in dispute (even though they do not know where it is themselves) 1 and that Ibn Sa’ud would never think of laying claim to land \ which everyone knows belongs to Qatar. They also point out \ that in giving the concession to P.C.L., Sheikh Abdullah drew the line well within the frontiers of Qatar, and they cannot see that this itself constitutes e danger. I have no copy of I the Concession, so I cannot say whether the wording in it sup ports this view. 5. They are at present auite content to leave the con duct of the matter in Helly’s hands, and pathetically trustful of the good faith of Ibn Sa’ud. Whet their attitude will be if they lose some of the land which ’’everybody” knows to be long to Q-atar I cannot say. It is a possibility which I have not so far succeeded in getting them to see. n.i ioiitica! q *Afeent, Bahrein.PoliticEl Agency, Dohs, 5th October 1949. CD Confidential. 11/17/49.

I pursued the subject, and asked him why they came. He said to see what they coul3 steal from the Company, to beg from their rel ations who were working for the Company, to look for work themselves, or simply because there was pasture. I asked what tribes tuey belonged to, and he said the Morra, ivlan- ssir, Ajman and Qahtani. , . then asked if Ibn Sa*ud levied the Zaka on them while they were here, and he said that he did. He said a baudi collector would come and levy the Zaka on any of Ibn oa ud s subjects who were here in ^atar, and that this gen erally happened in the Summer. He said that a collector had coroe last year, but that so far none had come ttiis year, ne thought it possible that one might come later. •it I consider Suleiman a more reliable witness than ^ either balih or the Sheikh, as he is more likely than they to know aoout this subject, having spent some time living out in the country where tnese tilings actually happen, and also because lie volunteered his information v/ithout having had time to think of the implications of what he was saying. He has in any case no reason to try to mislead me, and is a simple straightforward character. H.G. Jekins Bsc., H. M. Political Agent, Bahrain.SECRET.

I spoke to Shaikh Ali about Ibn Mansur's in cursion, and he tells me that he has long since re turned to Saudi Arabia, and that he wrote him a letter at the time of his visit telling him that if he wished to levy the-Zakat on Saudi subjects he should do so outside the boundaries of Qatar. Unfortunately no copy of this letter is available. 3. While I was looking into the Ibn Mansur episode, I learned that at about the same time the Saudi frontier guards from the Salwa post had pursued some Saudi Bedu^ who had sought to infiltrate into Qatar without passing through the control post, across the frontier and into Qatar. A shooting affray followed in which two Saudi guards and one Saudi Bedu were killed, - all on Qatar territory. I pointed out to Shaikh Ali the folly of allov;ing . incidents such as this to pass without protest or comment, and asked how we could defend his frontiers at conferences when he did nothing to defend them himself in fact. He said that he was weak and Ibn Saud was strong, and that there was nothing he could do. I re minded him that we had guaranteed his territorial inte grity, and were quite prepared to stand by our undertakings, but that by refusing to tell us of these happenings he was compelling us to fight with our hands bound. He agreed in future to inform me at once of any such events and said that he was most grateful to H.M.G. etc., etc. He said that he would put a post in his southern territory and give them the strictest orders to control such move ments in future. I agreed that it would be a good idea to do so, and subsequently suggested to Salih and the Adviser that this might well provide congenial employment for suitable members of the Ruling Family and for some Bedouin. I think Sa'ud and his brothers would make ex cellent Wardens of the southern Marches, but I doubt whether Shaikh Ali will be prepared to entrust the job to them. C.J. Pelly, Esq., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain.Confidential 11 / 36 / 50 . British Agency, Doha, 3rd June 1950. \^'i © 2. I was informed by Mansour bin Khal^lr; the Comnany ex guide, who is himself Sheikh of the Shahajpin section of the Bari Hajir, that the men concerned were Sa^udfis, Mansour is a -well- disposed character, and I have alw^y§ found his information on the subject of the Bedu accurate ivhere I have been able to check^^ it, and convincing even where f have not. (See my ll/l3/49~^f 24th September and ll/ie/49 of 5th October last to Jakins. I have subsequently had other occasions to approach Mansour for j oririat ion.) His information in this case id corroborated by the Sheikh himself. Evans reports that on one occasion when he was complaining about the uselessness of the guards in general and the Umm Sa»id guards in particular, the Sheikh said that if the Company did not want them he would send them all away, as they were all Sa'udis anyway. The Bani Ahmad have also several times told me that the Sheikh was afraid of his Bedu, as they were under Ibn Sa'ud’s protection and would appeal .to him. S o 3. There seem to be two separate problems here. The fisst is that for some reason the Sheikh recruited most of the Company guards from Bedu who did not belong to Qatar, and the second id' the Bani Ahmad’s allegation that the Sheikh's own Fidawi are not completely loyal. The first point does not seem to be in dispute, - my Abu Rashid tells me that the guards who were at Umm Sa'id under the Emir Ahmad were Manasir, Ihbab (from Oman) Munra, and Mi^eria' (also from Oman) together with a few non-Bedu Qataris. He says that those at Dukhan were mostly Qatari hangers-on of the Emir Jasim, but that the Bedu elements amongst them were Ihbab and Mahara (from Dhofar) . I do not know what was the reason which prompted Sheikh Abdullah to this course originally, but I do not tnink that the point is now of great importance, as the guards in question are now rapidly dwindling, and should soon vanish altogether. 4. The more serious question is the extent to which the Ruler ofi Qatar has any grip on even those who are commonly ac counted his 'own' Bedu. The Bani Hajir, wh6 are the largest indigenous body of Bedu, and who are described by Lorimer as 'properly belonging to Qatar' in didtinction to those who merely visit 'seasonally, are in fact divided between Qatar and Sa'udi Araoia. ThgUg ^ are two sections in Qatar, who presumably acknow - ledge the Ruler of Qatar as their overlord, but the third and * largest section, the A1 Mohammed, are said to be with bin Jiluwi and never to come to Qatar. Their chief is Mohammed bin 'Ayid, and they are estimated to be bigger than either ofl the two Qatari sections, but not as big as the two of them combined. The biggest- of the sections in Qatar is the A1 Khayarin, led by Sheikh Ghanim bi n Sa if, who is now very old, and lives with Sheikh^bduTlSTaF Riyan. His son Abdullah is the individual mentioned in paragraph 3 of my 11/18/49, who lives in Hassan's house, between the Palace at Doha and the proposed site of the permanent Agenisy building. He is one of the most unprepossessing rogues it is possible to imagine. With Mohammed biin Sa'id, the subject of Jakins»s c/q-53 You \ ? \ IS3Z. of 22nd Sentember 1949 to me./ C.J. Pelly Esq.

'/ - 6 • S • Mohammed bin Sa’id, whom I mentioned as one of the leade rs of the Khayarin wi th Sheikh Ali, paid me one of his periodical visiits yesterday, and I took the opportunity to discuss the Bani Hajir with him. One of the first things which emerged from our talk was that the Khayarin and the Shahawin are allowances by Ibn Sa^d. I asked whether they had~to go and collect these, and he said no, they were sent if the individuals did not go in person to collect, but that the usual thing was for a few of them to go and collect the lot. I asked whether only Sheikhs received it, and he said no, everyone in the tribe, and that all male children were notified to Ibn Sa f ud, and came on the pay-roll in due course. In this case Ibn Sa»ud undoubtedly khows more about the Qatar Bedu than the Ruler of Qatari 3. I talked of the comparative sizes of the three sections of the Bani Hajir, and he told me that the Eaici Khayarin numbered about 200 men, and 'spoke with one voice'; that the Shahawin were perhaps a little less than 200; and that the A1 Mohammed were the most numerous, but that they were too wrapped up in their flocks and herds, and were not 'warriors'. He said that the Khayarin and the Shahawin, whom he describes collectively as the Mukhadhaba . are the warriors, and that when Ibn Sa^d waged war on the ’Ajman they were all there. 4. I asked if the A1 Mohammed were to be considered followers of Ibn Sa*ud, and he said that they were. I went on 'But theKhayarin and the Shahawin.•••«•?' He embarked on a lengthy and circuitous tale, well larded with 'sellimk Allah's and 'Tawwal Allah ‘umrak’^, the gist of which was that he was present in those days when Sheikh Abdullah first visisted Ibn Sa*ud, 'and I said to Abdul Aziz at that time, 0 Abdul Aziz, we have found ourselves living with Abdullah, and in his place. And Abdul Aziz said 0 Muhammad, who lives with my brother Abdullah lives with me, and whd serves him serves me, and if I put you into that place it is so that you will do honour both to me and to my brother Abdullah. And I said we are grateful for this speech etc etc., and he increased our allowances which he made to all of us, and since then we have been in this place with Abdullah, though the A1 Mohammed are in the Dira of Ibn Jiluwi, which was formerly the place of all us Bani Hajir.' 5. I do not think that this basically affects the position as ^ set out in my last letter, but it illustrates well the way in which Ibn Sa'ud’s relations with the peripheral tribes are conducted. Lorimer evidently thought that the Bani Hajir belonged to Qatar, and on the occasion described by Mohammed bin Sa'id, they were in fact 'living in Abdullah^ place’, but Ibn Sa»ud nevertheless contrives to make a favour out of permitting them to continue to do so, and perpetuates his claim to have the authority to do so by an increased allowance. I do not think that too much importance need be attached to the last point, - Bedu are notoriously receivers of subsidies from ,{ many sources, and also, as I reported in paragraph 180 of my Diary -In December last, the al Thani themselves take allowances from Ibn Sa f ud. It may well prove that the latter has over-reached himself if he relies on such payments to establish a claim to Qatar or a part of it. It '/'/'V ^ S //^ t /££ 'lok none the lessdoes none the less complicate the task of those charged with the defence of Qatar 1 s sovereignty and frontiers at Conferences and the like, and enables Ibn Sa^d to put up a case which can be made to sound very plausible* * C.J.

Khalifa, has suggested to Cochrane that it would be a good idea if Cochrane were to go and take a look at Salwa, where, he asserts, Ibn Sa*ud is steadily encroaching on Qatar. I do not know whether there id any special reason why he should have raised the matter at this time, or whether he just profited from the fact that Cochrane went to see him a few days ago. Cochrane has asked what we think of the proposal. I said that he would have to be careful not to get put in the bag, and he said that if he went he would take some reliable guides ans see that he stayed well on the safe side of any line. I said that I would ask you. 2. I have never visited Salwa myself, though I should like to do so. I had abandoned the idea for this season though, and was thinking of trying to make it some time in the winter.

This practice has been discontinued for one year past.

I sent a copy of this letter to Furlonge with the follow ing remarks regarding para 3:- p. ° 'I share Stobart*s doubts as to the wisdom of encoura ging the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to expand. As to His Majesty’s Government's entering i#tfo treaty relations with the major tribes I did not/dmink that further commit ments of that kind in this a^vea would be considered. Hankey's letter No.EA 1057/2 of the 20th June to Sir Rupert Ray, which I have just seen, asking us to recon sider the Shaikh of Fujairah’s request for a treaty, sug gests otherwise. You will doubtless let me know if you consider that we should investigate the possibility and, of course, the advisability of entering into treaty relations with the major tribes.' 3. Hankey has now written to me as follows:- • * r- t Similarly, as regards Abu Dhabi policy towards Buraimi, we cannot decide what line to take without an estimate of the factors involved and the repercussions to be expected. It was, of course, Thesiger’s proposal for 'annexation' of Buraimi by Abu Dhabi that^in Furlonge's letter of 1st May we assumed you would consider as out of the question. You yourself refer to the possibility of encouraging the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to 'expand'. l' am not sure that even 'expansion' conveys what we have in mind. We are concerned rather with the question of consolidating, preferably by peaceful means, the Abu Dhabi influence and interest in Buraimi which already rightfully exists, v.e would welcome your considered views on the possibility and desirability of this. A related question on which we would also welcome your views is whether there is a real danger of Saudi penetration into Buraimi. We know that this key area is vital to the control of tne hinterland of both Trucial Oman and Oman proper and, to some extent, to the control of those areas themselves. We have also to take into account the Muscat interest - how far, for example, do Muscat and Abu Dhabi claims conflict ? If they do, how far can they be reconciled or perhaps, in some way com bined, in view of the common Saudi danger ? It will also be useful to explore the desirability and practicability of encouraging the Sultan of Muscat to re-establish his influence in Buraimi and the adjacent areas where some thing of a vacuum exists. In principle, we would wish to avoid extra commitments in the area, so far as possi ble, and indeed there are obvious objections to our having engagements with inland tribes which our sea power cannot reach and which our levy force can only influence to a minor degree. On the other hand, we must have a clear idea as to how our interests in the area and those of the Shaikhs can best be served.'mm - 2 - 4. The following are my reactions to Hankey’s letter, I should like you and Stobart (if you see no objection referring to him) to correct or confirm them. (under lining mine) (1) In another part of his letter Hankey stated that 'our thinking on all this is tentative ' If/this remark does not refer to Foreign Office telegram No.335 of the 5th August (a copy of which I sent you under complimentary slip No.334/20/50 of the 9th August) then that telegram is clearly inconsistent with the statement of the Foreign Office of the position in the first paragraph of Hankey's letter, i.e. a most definite line of non-intervention is taken in the telegram^ while the letter states that the Foreign Office cannot decide what line to take. (2) As regards encouraging Abu Dhabi aspirations or encouraging Abu Dhabi to 'expand' or encouraging the 'annexa tion' of Buraimi, (whichever phrase is used) I (and I think Stobart) were inclined to the opinion that the only way of helping in this was to let the Shaikh have the rifles he asked for; but that he should not have those rifles because of his difficult attitude generally and particularly because of his refusal to accept the Dubai-Abu Dhabi boundary award. The question which to my mind arises first of all in this context now is this: if we consider that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi's aspirations in Buraimi should be encouraged in view of the likelihood that their fulfilment would off-set Saudi expansionism, is the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi's difficult behaviour no longer (since the Saudi threat probably grows with time) a good reason for withholding encouragement of those aspira tions ? (The question of what form such encouragement should take if the Foreign Office ever agree to it being given - whether by permitting the Shaikh to get his quota of rifles or otherwise - is one on which I should welcome your views.) (3) Personally, I think that we should be sympathetic to Abu Dhabi aspirations in Buraimi and might go so far now as to allow the Shaikh the rifles, though it would be better if he came to see me and made his peace before we do so. I do not, however, think that we can intervene in such ventures to any greater extent than that. If, however, the Foreign Office will not accept 'expansionism' or even (if made to them) the suggestion of sympathy, and permission for the rifles, which seems to be the idea in the penultimate sentence of para 4 of Hankey's letter, then we come to the question arising from that sentence - and the last sentence. Is it necessary to consolidate 'the Abu Dhabi influence and interest in Buraimi which already rightfully exists '? I understand that Shaikh Zaid controls six of the eight Buraimi settlements and controls them absolutely. Is this the case ? If it is, then I can see no point in Hankey's request for my views. (4) Is there a real danger of Saudi penetration into Buraimi ? Stobart in his letter which I have quoted, gives no opinion about this as he probably thought it was a matter on which Jeddah should report. I am inclined to think that e.g. the Na'im and A1 bu Shamis chiefs (like most others of their sort in the Arabian peninsula) receive presents from Ibn Saud, and we know about the Saudi slave traders in Buraimi. I should like information^ if any is available, regarding presents or any other indications of Saudi penetra tion. My own idea is that the Saudis are content with the position as it is and await with confidence the outcome of the findings re this area of the 'fact finding commission' /in) 3 in the frontier negotiations. (5) I should also like your replies to the Muscat and Abu Dhabi claims. I have written to Chauncy telling him that I think the Sultan of Muscat should be warned of the Saudi claims. If that does not stir him into action, nothing else is likely to. 5. I have sent you another letter from the Eastern Department asking for more information on these subjects and referring to the possibility that Stobart should get it by going to Buraimi as suggested in the Foreign Office telegram already referred to. I leave it to you and Stobart to decide whether he should go to Buraimi or not as I well realise that in this weather it may be impracticable for several reasons to do so. I would, however, like some reply to this letter and the Eastern Department's letter as soon as possible. /S-/3Z, 5 3 M &gt;£•33 9 Ya t SECRET AND URP,F.CT: QakJj&amp;J / BRITISH AGENCY, SHARJAH, AUGUST 23rd 1950. My P3/49/50 of 27th May 1950, about alleged Saudi designs upon the Nai'ms* independence My Buraimi informant, Shaikh Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz, a blind Kejdi Qadhi who has no cause to love the al-Saud, has informed me by letter that one of Ibn Saud's sons has been to Buraimi and bought a garden fromSaqr bin Sultan of the Nai'm and that Saqr M asked him for help' (presumably money). I cannot imagine that a Saudi Emir would want a garden in Buraimi for merely growing dates, and I assume that the reason for the purchase is political. 3. I hope to have further details in a week * s time when Shaikh Abdullah comes to Sharjah. At present, he communicates by means of a very crude code of names which precludes very much detail. Incidentally, I shall have to pay Shaikh Abdullah, and I shall be grateful if you could ask for a special allocation of Mission Fund for this purpose. If you happen to have a rifle in the Agency gift-store for his son, it would be most helpful also. , ^ fcW /o 5 4^? 5. Depending upornfuture developments and upon my enquires into pp^sible was between A1 Bu Falah and the Nai'm (F.O.&gt;elegram to P.R. 335, forwarded under your C/TC-135 of 15th August 1950), I think it might be useful if I went to Buraimi in September to see Zaid. Zaid was once anxious that we should borrow the disused Jahili Fort there, and treat it for the while as a temporary Agency. For some reason, he was keen that we should fly our flag over it. As a means of confirming our support of Zaid's present position there, I can see some advantage in this suggestion and I should be grateful for your instructions. I think that now that we have requisite vehicles, occasional (say quarterly), visits to Buraimi might prove useful. They would, of course, involve us in a certain amount of expense in the way of entertainment. Confidential.
