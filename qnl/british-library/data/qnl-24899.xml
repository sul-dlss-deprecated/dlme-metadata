I have lately been pressing for reply to onr stipulations in regard to suspension of sinking fund rather than for payment of interest, though I have constantly reminded the Persian Government of latter also. Both questions are before the Financial Committee of Assembly, Avhich, Minister for Foreign Affairs gives me to understand, is inclined to object to the form rather than the substance of first of our stipulations respecting sinking fund ; but he will say nothing definite pending discussions of Committee. I will continue to press. Persian Government, though in great straits for money, could probably pay interest if strongly pressed. Practically no revenue is coming in except from customs and telegraphs. [865—310] p —CONFIDENTIAL. Sir Edward Grey to Mr. Marling {Tehran). (No. 191.)

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copy of the note which, in accordance with your telegram No. 137 of the 11th instant, I have addressed to the Persian Government respecting the non-payment of the interest on the British Loan of 1903-4, and reminding them that no reply had yet been given to the conditions His Majesty’s Government attached to assenting to the request of Persia for the temporary suspension of the sinking fund of that loan. I have, &amp;e. (Signed) CHABLES M. MARLING. Inclosure in No. 1. Mr. Marling to Ala-es-Suitaneh. /O Your Highness, Tehran, October 15, 1907. AS your Highness is well aware, the annual payments for interest and sinking fund of the loans made by His Majesty’s Government to that of Persia in 1903 and 1904 are secured, in case of insufficiency of the revenues of the Caspian Sea fisheries and of the posts and telegraphs, on the revenues of the Imperial Customs of Ears and the Persian Gulf. No payment on this account has, however, been made this year. It is therefore legitimate to conclude, and His Majesty’s Government have indeed good reason to believe, that the above-mentioned revenues have been applied to other purposes. I have consequently received instructions from my Government to request your Highness to inform me what satisfactory reasons the Persian Government can adduce for diverting to other purposes revenues which have been formally pledged for the service of the British Loan. I am directed further to remind your Highness of the conditions which His Majesty’s Government have attached to giving their assent to the request of the Persian Government for the temporary suspension of the sinking fund of the loan in question. Those conditions, which were communicated to your Highness in Sir C. Spring-Rice’s note of the 31st August last, are, it must be admitted, exceedingly lenient; they imposed no new burdens on the Persian Treasury, and are in fact even more moderate than common prudence in a business transaction of the same kind between private persons would dictate. It might therefore have been expected that they would he accepted with alacrity. The mere fact of the request should naturally connote the most scrupulous regularity in the payment of the interest, and it is therefore a matter of concern to His Majesty’s Government that their forbearance in the matter of the sinking fund has not met with the recognition it deserves. I have the honour to request that your Highness will inform me without delay what reply I am to communicate to His Majesty’s Government. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING.

I suppose that they dz not mean to repudiate the obligation to bear half of the loss that will occur if the Persian Government does not pay its debts; and it seems to me that it would be well to come to an agreement now as to the conditions in which the India Office is to effect recoveries from the Imperial Government (if occasion should arise) in partial reimbursement of losses arising out of the loan. If the proper recoveries are not made, the matter will no doubt be brought to the notice of Parliament by the Auditor of the India Office accounts in his annual report 2, If recoveries are to be made without undue delay and controversy, a. simple procedure is necessary and I think that the following proposals might be made to the Foreign Office:- The•• 9^. . 3 A/rvw ^ * . tx&gt; J V t.

It will he seen that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury sanction the suspension of the sinking fund on the loan for three years hut presume that no claim will he made on the Imperial Exchequer in con sequence of the failure of the Persian Government to fulfil their obligations.

With regard to this I am to say that, in view of the conclusion of the Anglo-Kussian Agreement, there is in Sir E.

Novemher 1907. \u cr% / 7 ’ / ' r / The Lords Commissioners oT His Majesty's Treas- 1 * ury have had before them Mr. Mallet's letter of the 31st July last (24698) respecting the advance of £300,000 which was made in April 1903 and September 1904, in two instalments of £200,OCX) and £100,000 by ✓ * the Government of India to the Persian Government. The terms of the advance, which was made through the medium of the Imperial Bank of Persia, were, as My Lords understand, that interest at the rate of 9f 0 should he paid, and that repayment should he spread over a period of twenty years. Of the in terest, 4.% was to he remitted, as received, to the Government of India and the Bank was to retain a com mission of 1% for its services. The security con sists practically of a lien on the Customs of South ern Persia. His Majesty's Government undertook to share The Under Secretary of State, Poreign Office.» share with the Govermient of India in equal moieties any loss through failure of the Persian Government to meet their obligations in regard to interest or sinking fund on the advances made* It is stated in the letter under reply that in April last a request was received from the' Persian Government for a delay of six months in the payment of the instalment on the loan due on the 5th April in re spect of interest and capital, and that, for the rea sons mentioned, it was decided, with the concurrence of the India Office, to accede to the request. It is further stated that a request has since been received from the Persian Government for the consent of His ' t ■ Majesty's Government to the suspension of the sihk- ing fund for three years, interest alone being paid, during which period a scheme of reforms is to be in troduced into the finances; and with this request Sec retary Sir Edward Grey, having obtained the concur rence of the Secretary of State for India, considers it desirable to comply. In the circumstances represented My Lords assent to this proposal on the conditions which Sir E. Grey recommends.. ^ X. recommends, namely that the Persian Government agree not to contract any loan with a foreign hank or Gov ernment without the option being first given to Eng land and Russia, and that unless in the meantime some serious effort is made to put the finances of the country in order His Majesty’s Government re serve the right at any time during the next three years to insist on the payment of the arrears due \ ' . , » || ^ in respect of the sinking fund. ^ \ • ■, ■ • • , Jp My Lords presume that no claim will he made on the imperial Exchequer in consequence of the failure of the Persian Government to fulfil their obligations. But They desire to remind the Secretary of State that infomation as to the advance, and as to the liability which has been incurred in case of loss, has not, so far, been communicated to Parliament. The situation indeed is far from regular, for though an undertaking has been given to the Government of India involving the tax payer of this country in a liability for the capital sum of £150,000, with interest thereon, which Parliament would, no doubt, feel bound to recognise, the guarantee has neverthe lessnevertheless no legal validity, and could only he made valid hy a charge on the consolidated Fund, for which an Act of Parliament would he necessary. And, in any event, no claim from the Indian Government in respect of the arrangement could he met without a grant from Parliament, lily Lords are aware that for reasons of policy it was conaidered essential at the time the advance v/as made that no publicity should attach to it, and it was for this reason that it was arranged 4 t that the whole of the advance should he made hy the Government of India. It is also true that no loss need necessarily he incurred hy the postponement of the sinking fund payments now contemplated. On the other hand the present situation, as described in the letter under raply, renders it important, in Their Lordships' judgnent, to consider whether Parliament should not he informed of the existence of the liabil ity, if this could now he done without prejudice to the public interest, as a very unfortunate Impression, and one which Sir E. Grey will agree that it is most de sirable to avoid, might he given to the Legislature as to oto the conduct of the Executive in financial matters if a loss were ultimately incurred, and the liabil ity only then disclosed in order to obtain the means of meeting it. I am also directed to inquire how the suspen sion of the interest payment will affect the ar rangement with the Bank under which they were to receive 1% of the interest payment. My Lords conclude that the present correspond ence has no reference to the advance of £200,000 &lt; , which it was arranged in 1906 should form part of a loan of £400,000 to be made jointly by this coun try, India and Russia, which was returned this year by the Bank of Persia as not being required by the Persian Government. This point is mentioned in view of the statement at page 2 of the letter under reply that the consent of the British and Russian Governments has been asked to the suspension of L the sunking fund.

I DIP) not fail to transmit to my Government copy of your Highness’ note of tho 23rd July relative to the request of the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government should consent to the suspension of all payment on account of sinking fund for the space of three years. His Majesty’s Government have learned with pleasure that the Imperial Govern ment and the Sacred National Assembly are taking energetic measures for necessary reforms, the establishment of financial equilibrium, and for the development of trade. They have also taken note of your statement that these measures require reasonable time to be successful, and that at least a period of three years is required for the achievement of these reforms and of the objects in view. They fully appreciate the sentiments expressed by your Highness on behalf of the National Assembly as to the friendship existing between the two States, which they sincerely reciprocate. After duly considering the contents of your letter and the arguments which you have so ably urged, they have Instructed me to consent to the request of the Persian Government that a delay of three years may be allowed during which nothing should be paid on account of the sinking fund, but only interest, in order that the Persian Government and the National Representatives may have time to carry on the necessary reforms and to put the income and expenditure of the country on a proper footing. I am to add that, in consenting to this request, His Majesty’s Government under stands that the following conditions will be observed. I irstly, in accordance with the general law as to debtors and creditors, it is under stood that the Persian Government, on its side, will not contract any new foreign loan without giving their creditors, England and Russia, the option of advancing money on the same conditions. The reason of this condition will be plain to you, for according to law and custom a debtor who makes an arrangement with a creditor must engage not to incur new debts from other quarters without first giving the option to his original creditor. Secondly, it is understood that the Persian Government, in the general interests of freedom of commerce, strictly maintains the promise made by the Attabek on the 27th October, 1901, and confirmed in the present year, to the effect that “the Persian Government will not grant to any one the monopoly of coining silver in the State Mint, and that in the matter of the importation of silver all persons, whether Persians or foreigners, will be treated equally and without distinction.” Thirdly, it is understood that His Majesty’s Government has consented to the request of the Persian Government and to waive the rights secured to them by engage- [2633 gg —22]ment in order that the Government and the Mejlis may have time to carry on he necessarv reforms, and put the expenditure and income of the country on a proper footing ^ If however, to its great regret, His Majesty’s Government should learn that no serious effort is being made to carryout the reforms of which you speak it is understood that His Majesty’s Government will have the right to demand payme the arrears of sinking fund at any time within the next three years.

Half of this amount was as you are aware provided from Imperial and half from Indian funds. A further sum of £50,000 was in December last paid to the Bank from Indian revenues for the purpose of a similar joint Anglo-Russian advance of an amount not exceeding £100,000 to the Valiahd to meet the pressing financial demands of the situation created by the then impending death of the Shah. The occasion for making these advances has not arisen and there appears no likelihood of its arising in the immediate future. In these circumstances it is desirable that the amounts in question should be refunded to Imperial and Indian le Manager, The Imperial Bank of Persia.Indian funds and I am directed ty Secretary Sir E.

(Translation.) Your Excellency, Tehran, July 23, 1907. YOUR Excellency is well aware of the energetic measures taken by the Imperial Government and the Sacred National Assembly for necessary reforms, establishment of financial equilibrium, and for the development of trade, but it is obvious that these measures require reasonable time to be successful, and at least a period of three years is required for the achievement of these reforms and the objects in view. The National Assembly, being alive as to the friendship existing between the two States and the help always given by the British Government to promote the interests of this Imperial Government, have specially proposed to the Foreign Office that, by the help of the English and the Russian Representatives, a delay may be allowed for the payment of the coupons of the loans to the Banks, i.e., a delay of three years may be allowed during which nothing should be paid on account of the sinking fund but only interest. When during the period above mentioned the financial reforms in view are done it may become possible to increase the sinking fund in a suitable manner so that the debt may be paid off sooner. It is hoped that by this friendly help the Persian Government and the National Representatives may have time to carry on the necessary reform and to put the income and expenditure of the country on a proper footing. With the perfect confidence that the Persian officials have always had in the friendship and good intentions of the British authorities, your Excellency is requested to bring this intention and request of the Imperial Government to the notice of the proper authorities and to strengthen in this respect the good will of the British Government towards that of Persia in order that on the present occasion when the Persian Government is engaged in reforms the British Government may increase the friendship between the two States by accepting this request and helping in this matter as they have always done in the interests of this Imperial Government.

He did not speak favourably of idea of sending for French financier, and has suggested application to Canton Bank at Lucerne. There is no Government and no security for a loan, land revenues are not paid, and customs revenue decreasing.

Sir:- I am directed by Secretary sir E.Grey to trans mit to you to be laid before Mr. Secretary Morley the enclosed copies of telegrams from His Majesty's Minis ter at Tehran relative to the financial situation in Persia. There can be no question that the appearance of Germany as a serious political factor in Persia, which would inevitably result from a large German loan on adequate security, would be highly detrimental to Bri tish interests and Sir E.Grey is of opinion that a loan from France or indeed from any European country would be scarcely less objectionable as likely to intro duce possible complications into the situation which might neutralize the good results which it is hoped will The Under Secretary of State, India Office.'

Should therefore a request be made to the British and Russian Governments for the suspension of the sink ing funds their respective loans, as proposed by the Assembly, Sir E.Grey considers that it would be well worthy of consideration whether it should not be acceded to, on the condition that the Persian Govern ment agree not to contract any loan with a foreign bank or Government without the option being first given to England and Russia.

Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 10.) (No. 103.) Sir, Tehran, May 19, 1907. I HAVE the honour to inform you that Herr Gutmann, agent for the Dresdner Bank, has arrived here, and has been placed in communication with the Persian authorities by Herr Stemrich, the German Minister. I have spoken with the Atabeg-i-Azam, the Foreign Minister, and the Minister of Finance on the subject of Herr Gutmann’s mission. My general impression, derived from the confidential statements of these gentlemen, is as follows: — When Baron Richthofen, German Charge d’Affaires, negotiated in the summer with the Persian Government for the grant of a Bank Concession, he was asking for what was already a Treaty right. The Persian Government could not refuse to a German banking institution the right to establish itself in Persia and there carry on commercial business. But it was understood verbally that the bank, when established, should make advances on current account to the Persian Government in return for such favours as should subsequently be negotiated. Herr Gutmann has now arrived with the intention of deciding the conditions (if any are possible) under which an advance could be made to the Persian Government. Such a proceeding does not compromise the German Government, which cannot, of course, be held responsible for the operation of a private firm. But the fact that the German Government cannot (in conformity with its pledges) take an active part in the negotiations implies the consequence that the security which the bank must demand in return for its advances must be a real and solid one. The difficulty is, where and how can such security be found ? I gather that the Persian officials, while expressing, as usual, a sincere desire for a pecuniary advance, are much impressed by the determination shown by Herr Gutmann not to consent to an advance without adequate security. And in view of the opposition which may be expected from Russia, England, and the Persian people, it is extremely difficult to see how such security can be afforded. Herr Gutmann and Herr Stemrich themselves state that there is no valid reason why Persia should not be a good field for profitable investment, from the purely commercial point of view. The banker informs me that he intends to begin operations on a modest scale by advancing money on bills of lading in connection with the trade between Persia and Constantinople. Constantinople is an important distributing station for Persian trade, and the Dresdner Bank finances the Deutsch-Orient Bank established in that city. In addition to this business he proposes to look about him for profitable enterprises, and is in hopes of finding such, especially in connection with mining and irrigation. 1 confess that the experience of other nations in this respect is not encouraging. Foreign enterprise in Persia has been, so far, a long record of failure and disap pointment. # ^ J I am in frequent communication with my Russian colleague on this subject, ana we have both received information to the effect that Herr Gutmann, who was on intimate terms with Mustapha Kamel in Egypt, is making free use of the sympathy shown by the German Emperor for the interests and aspirations of Mussulmans. He may be successful in obtaining some measure of influence here, but I do not believe that, unless he is prepared to make an advance without adequate security—which is not very likely, although of course possible in the hopes of favours to come he can succeed in seriously shaking the position of the Russian and British Banks, which, owing to the backing of their respective Governments, must retain a very strong hold on the Persian Government. . . , , 1 venture, however, to ask your attention to the circumstances already reported to you in connection with the proposed import of silver for coinage by the Imperial Bank, If the German Bank was prepared to advance the 104,000/. in London m order to [2512 k—7]2 enable the Persian Government or the National Bank to lay hands on the bank’s silver reserve, the situation may become serious at any moment, as a combined attack on the Imperial Bank’s privilege of a note issue, organized by the National Bank with the support of the German Bank, would have disagreeable consequences. At present a union between the two is not very likely, firstly, owing to the strong anti-European feelings which now animate the Persian nation, and, secondly, because the Nation Bank has as yet no real existence and no capital whatever. But the danger exists and should not be Inst sight of, although the Germans can at present, I believe with truth, deny the existence ot any compact between the two. The French Minister, who has served in Morocco, is greatly impressed by the political and commercial dangers involved in an attempted isolation of Germany. He maintains that a hostile attitude towards German influence and enterprise on the part of the three friendly Governments of Russia, France, and England will creite automatically a bond of sympathy between the Persians and Germans, and that on the publication of an Agreement between Russia and England, Germany will naturally assume the role de sauveur, which she will be able to turn to political and commercial profit. He is therefore in favour of a policy of “going to meet the danger,” and inviting the financial co-operation of Germany and France. The necessary result, however, of a formal financial alliance d qautre would be to impose European financial control on the Persian people, and this would open a most difficult question. But it should not, in M. de la Martiniere’s opinion, be impossible to form a working Commercial Agreement between the nations ot Europe for avoiding friction or securing some sort of common action for the development of Persia. A possible form of such an Agreement might be found in co-operation on the part of foreign capitalists with the National Bank in the form of a combine in which existing banks would be merged. M. de Hartwig appears to think that the Russian and English Banks should afford assistance to the National Bank. In the opinion of the Attabek, who knows the country well, the mere word “ Anglo-Russian loan ” raises a spectre which frightens the ordinary Persian out of all equanimity. His Highness thinks the proposal desirable but impossible. I am inclined to agree with him, but the co-operation of several nations together might be possibly more acceptable, although even this is a matter of doubt. If I might venture on a suggestion, it would be that it would be wise to await developments. The financial stringency here will either cure itself or, if it become intolerable, force the Assembly itself to find a remedy. If the only remedy is in foreign financial assistance we are ready to afford it, but only with the consent of the representatives of the Persian people. With regard to financial assistance from other sources, I think a hostile attitude would defeat its purpose ; for it would increase the popularity of the object of our attacks. If offered on purely commercial lines, we have no valid right to object so long as the guarantees we possess are respected ; if for political concessions, our objections will be valid, and will also receive the support of popular opinion, which will condemn all foreign interference without discrimination. But financial assistance on purely commercial lines appears to me at present to be out of the question. If it were not, the Imperial Bank of Persia would be the first to know it. I have &amp;c.

Spring-Rice to act as suggested. I am.[This Document isjjie Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Gnyammant i I EECEIYED this morning from M. Isvolsky a private letter, of which I have the honour to transmit a copy, proposing that a note should he addressed by the British and Russian Representatives at Tehran to the Persian Prime Minister to the effect that as the Persian Grovernment had not, after a lapse of more than two months, taken advantage of the financial aid which had been preferred to them, the offer was now withdrawn by the British and Russian Governments. M. Isvolsky added that, if the British Government agreed with the terms of the note, the necessary instructions would be sent to M. de Hartwig. I would respectfully beg leave to submit the following considerations, which to my mind would render it unfortunate were the two Governments to abandon the project to make a joint advance to the Persian Government. I understand from recent telegrams from Sir 0. Spring-Rice that circumstances have arisen which do not necessitate the immediate withdrawal of the joint offer. The Yaliahd has admitted the financial control by the Assembly, and, consequently, the Persian Government could not accept an advance without legislative sanction. Presumably, the know ledge that such preliminary legislative sanction is now recognized by the Persian Government will remove from the minds of the Assembly the apprehension that a loan wall be concluded behind their backs, and doubtless means could be found for letting it be known that no advance would be made without the consent of the Assembly. Any suspicions which may exist, or have existed, in the minds of the popular party that the Prussian and British Governments were putting pressure on the Persian Government would therefore he removed. I further understand that the financial needs are urgent, that local contributions or internal loans are not likely to produce the necessary funds, and that before long the Persian Government will have to apply for foreign financial assistance. In these circumstances, if we were to retire from the scene in respect to financial aid, the Persian Government would, of necessity, have to apply elsewhere, and, without doubt, they would make overtures to Germany, and it would he doubtful if the German Government, knowing that the Russian and British Governments had formally declined to render assistance, would also refuse to occupy the field which was left open to them. There is another point which I should like also to bring, with all diffidence, to your notice. The joint action which the two Governments were taking in regard to financial matters was most helpful in respect to the general negotiations concerning Persia. If I might say so, we had thrown out one grapnel which had brought the two barques into connection, and I trusted that gradually one or more grapnels might also he attached; hut if we are to cast away our present solitary grapnel the two vessels may drift apart. Sir C. Spring-Rice has already noticed a tendency on the part of the Russian Eegation, since the arrival of the Yaliahd at Tehran, to be less eager for joint action, and though I have not hitherto observed any indications here, it is possible that they may later be apparent. I quite understand that if local considerations render a withdrawal desirable, and if the Russian Government are ready to concur with such a view, it would be difficult and perhaps impolitic for His Majesty’s Government to insist on the maintenance of the financial offer which has been made. But I venture to suggest that I should be authorized to lay before M. Isvolsky the considerations which induced Sir C. Spring- Rice to deem it unnecessary to disturb the present position of the question of the loan, and that I should propose that the two Representatives should be once more M. Isvolsky the probability of the Persian Government, failing our support, addressing themselves later to the German Government, and I could possibly then have an opportunity of ascertaining the precise views which his Excellency holds as to German action in Persia.

'' ’ T n , T ^ Peter sburyh, December 16, 1906. ON the 9th instant I wrote a private letter to M. Isvolsky, stating that he had doubtless heard from Tehran that the Russian and British Representatives were of opinion that the advance to he made to the Persian Treasury should be done publicly and on the responsibility of the Persian Government, and that it would be desirable to await a settlement of the differences between that Government and the popular party. I added that His Majesty’s Government were in agreement with these views. I further stated that I had received information from Tehran to the effect that the Assembly had collected sufficient money to pay the arrears due to the troops and that I knew that his view was that no steps should be taken on our part, as the money was at the disposal of the Persian Government, on the conditions laid down by the two Governments, and that neither Government had any desire to force its acceptance on the Persian Government. At my interview yesterday with his Excellency he read and handed to me a reply of which I have the honour to transmit a copy. On reading this letter a^ain, it seemed to me that there might be a possibility that the Russian Minister might act on his instructions before His Majesty’s Government had had an opportunity of expressing their views as to whether a formal demand from the Grand Vizier for the advance, irrespective of the assent of the Assembly, should be immediately accepted. I therefore wrote a letter to M. Isvolsky, of which I beg leave to inclose a copy’ expressing the hope that M.

Tout en pensant, d’accord avec le Gouvernement Britannique, qu’il serait peut-etre preferable d’attendre que le Sadr-i-Azam parvienne a etablir une entente avec le Medjliss au^ sujet de 1’avance, le Gouvernement Imperial ne verrait pourtant pas d’objections a ce que les sommes promises fussent delivrees au Gouvernement Persan sur une demande formelle de Mouchir-oud-Hovleh, meme dans le cas ou ce dernier ne parviendrait pas a vaincre la resistance de I’Assemblee Nationale.

Since the date when I made a communication to Count Lamsdorff, in the sense of your telegram No. 34 of the 2nd February last, to the effect that His Majesty’s Govern ment was desirous of abstaining from making any money advance to the Persian Government without the knowledge and concurrence of the Russian Government (my despatch No. Ill of the 7th February), the Persian Minister at St. Petersburg!!, the son of the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, was present in Tehran in connection with loan negotiations with Russia. I gather that Russia expressed her willingness to make a loan of a considerable sum, but under very onerous conditions. These conditions, according to independent though most anxious to secure the proffered loan, and the Shah himself were unwilling to accept the conditions on the ground that they would put an end to Persian independence. Their opposition was strengthened by the growing popular discontent, which, on the news of a new Russian loan, would certainly have assumed very formidable dimensions. During the summer meetings were held in the Shah’s presence at which violent language was held, and the Ain-ed-Dowleh’s expulsion from office gave point to the expostulations made by the opponents of the loan, for it proved beyond a doubt that the popular movement was something to be feared—indeed, that it threatened the dynasty The great influence enjoyed at that time by the British Legation, owing to the energetic action taken by Mr. Grant Duff, added a new element to the situation. It was plain that England had the power of setting on foot an agitation which would make a Russian loan impossible, while a British loan would have been greeted with satisfaction. Under these circumstances, the Mushir-ed-Dowleh became Sadrazam. Although both he and his son were deeply engaged in the Russian loan negotiations, his naturally timorous character made him reluctant to bear the odium of concluding a loan at once. He refused the loan under the proffered conditions. The Russian Government had suggested that the negotiations should he continued at St. Petersburgh, and that M. Nans should be sent there to assist at drawing up the terms and in supplying the necessary information (Mr. Grant Duff’s telegram No. 229 of the 2nd December, and Sir Arthur Nicolson’s No. 642 of the 21st September, paragraph 4). The Shah, however, refused this offer, and insisted that the negotiations should take place at Tehran. Finally, I understand, a proposal was made by the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, which received an encouraging reply, to the effect that a temporary advance should be made to meet the pressing necessities of the Government, and that subsequently, when occasion offered, the negotiations should be resumed for a laige and permanent loan. It was, however, evident that an advance irom Russia alone was open to the same objections on the score of popular sentiment as a permanent loan, and would probably have laid Russia open to a dangerous popular campaign. A month after the Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s accession to office M. Isvolsky informed Sir Arthur Nicolson (see his despatch No. 575 of the 1st September) that the Russian Government, though no reply had been made at the time to the communication made in my private letter to Count Lamsdorff, was of the opinion that a joint advance by [2261 7] [B] PERSIA.

Sir, Tehran, December 6, 1906. history of the loan negotiations in the last six months. My information is derived in accounts which have reached me from the highest sources, amounted to the practical control of Persian foreign relations by the Russian Government. The Ain-ed-Dowleh, itself.2 lin o 'land and Russia was the best way of meeting the financial difficulties of irersia, and that they had recently refused a request from Persia for an immediate advance of 500,000L and also a loan of 1,650,000/. A joint Anglo-Russian advance was then agreed upon. The advance as originally proposed was to he repaid m March, out ot the proceeds of a loan; the Persian Government objected to so short a term, but consented to a year’s delay. The Mushir-ed-Dowleh, indeed, raised no objection to the later proposal to this effect made by the two Governments on the initiative ot The present situation, therefore, if the loan contract is signed, is that pioposed by the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, namely, that negotiations should be carried on for the conclusion of a large loan, during the delay allowed for under the conditions ot the I venture to add that experience shows that the Russian Foreign Office was not kept informed of the previous loan negotiations which in 1900 and 1902 were cairied on between the Russian Financial Department and the Persian Government Indeed on both occasions Sir Charles Scott and Sir Charles Hardmge were explicitly assured by the then Foreign Ministers that no negotiations were on foot. It would seem as if the Russian Foreign Office had been to some extent left in the dark as regards the recent negotiations. The presence of M. Grube in St. Petersburg!! (he arrived there m May) ma% account for the action which appears to have been taken by some Department of the Russian Government, doubtless without the knowledge of M. Isvolsky, who imagined that the informal agreement between the Russian and English Governments was in force, according to which neither Government was to make “loans without the knowledge of the other.” I have, &amp;c.

Sir, Tehran, December 4, 1906. IN continuation of my despatch No. 280 of the 9th ultimo, I have the honour to report that it had been arranged between the Mushir-ed-Dowleh and the English and Russian Ministers that the loan contract should he signed by the Sadr Azam and the Directors of the English and Russian Banks on the afternoon of Sunday, the 4th ultimo. Some delay took place in preparing the Persian text, which was not ready till Monday morning. At the same time it had been arranged that the Mushir-ed-Dowleh should communicate on Sunday to the English and Russian Ministers the draft of the note which he should address to them indicating the objects to which the Persian Govern ment proposed to devote the proceeds of the advance. This step, however, the Mushir- ed-Dowleh has hitherto failed to take. On the Monday following the Sadr Azam was requested to fix a time for signing the Agreement. This he did not do. It was stated that he had some difficulty in drawing up the draft note. According to trustworthy information, he himself had advanced a sum of money to a native banker on the security of the loan, and naturally desired to recoup himself. As, however, other statesmen had equally pressing personal claims, it was a matter of considerable difficulty to adjust their differences. In the meantime the rumour got abroad that the Government was on the point of signing an Agreement for another foreign loan. It was the month of Ramazan, and the mosques were full. Impassioned sermons were preached against the policy of the Government, which was engaged in selling the country to foreigners in order themselves to make money out of the transaction. The patriotic and religious sentiments of the crowded congregations were aroused ; men offered money and women their jewels in order to pay off the foreign debt. The movement grew in strength. The Finance Minister was summoned before the Assembly, and although he was listened to respect fully (for his character for honesty is well known), it was soon evident that the Assembly would not dare to sanction the loan ; and the Government, without the sanction of the Assembly, would not dare to sign the contract. The Assembly learned for the first time that the revenues of the Empire were pledged to foreign Governments, who could foreclose if the interest was not paid, and that an additional burden was now to be laid on the revenues already pledged. They had all good reason to know, from their personal experience, that money, if granted to the Government, would be divided among the Shah and the Ministers, and that little or nothing would be devoted to the real necessities of the country, whatever might be the pledges of the Sadr Azam and however solemnly given. A movement v r as started for founding a national bank, and subscriptions were invited and soon were made from all quarters. A nominal sum, consisting mainly of promises to pay, was soon collected of about 500,000 tomans (100,000/.). But it was not long before it was discovered that there was no cash forthcoming. The amount of silver coin in the country is limited, and the greater part is in the hands of the foreign banks. The latter naturally refused to part with it unless they knew for certain whether the Government would or would not consent to accept the advance. The result is that at the present moment there is a financial deadlock. The Government has borrowed large sums from native bankers, which it is unable to repay. The native bankers are indebted to the merchants of the bazaar, and are unable to meet their liabilities. It is impossible to obtain an advance from the only available source, namely, the foreign banks. Under the circumstances the Mushir-ed-Dowdeh addressed a private request to the Russian Minister for an advance on account, suggesting that they could sign an Agree ment with secret conditions as to the guarantee, which could be concealed from the Assembly. The Russian Minister refused the offer and at once informed me. At the [2261 a«—5] 1^02 same time a request was made to me on behalf of some members of the 1 ssem y to use pressure on the English Bank, in order to induce the Director to advance money for the purpose of founding the new national hank. I explained that such action on my part was quite out of the question, and informed M. Hartw.g of what had occurred. We have both endeavoured to impress on any one who addressed us on the subject that our Governments were by no means anxious to make the advance which, in t e case Russia, was on evidently disadvantageous terms—but that we had consented to he step in response to the urgent appeals made to us by the Persian Government. We had insisted, as a sin* qv/non ,on the condition that the expenditure should he justified and that the money should not be squandered. We had asked for security, as an ordinary commercial precaution, and without any political conditions. An honourable o er had been made to the Persian Government, which they were at liberty to take or to leave So far we did not know whether the offer was refused or accepted ; until we did, we must adont an attitude of perfect neutrality, and sanction an advance neither to one party noi t0 ‘^conclusion, I venture to record a somewhat remarkable statement made to me by a Persian hanker who passes for the honest man of Tehran I asked him why the Mushir and the Assembly could not agree on the terms of the note to t c i c ga ion indicating the objects of the expenditure. In this way, I said the Assembly would exercise effective control. He said, in reply, that unless the Assembly received the money it would have no guarantee that the money was actually expended tor the purposes indicated, and that unless the Mushir received the money himself he would not care to sign the Loan Agreement.

IB] PERSIA CONFIDENTIAL. No. 1. Sir C. Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey .—{Received January 21.) I HAVE th e honour to state that His Imperial Majesty the Valialid 'arrivefl in Tehran on the 16tli ultimo. For some time intrigues had been carried on in the Palace, chiefly by the Shoa-es-Saltaneh and the Minister of the Court, to prevent his departure from Tabreez, and there were good grounds for believing that the Shah himself, who is much attached to the Shoa, favoured the latter’s candidate to the throne, which was certainly supported In 7 the reactionary Palace clique, who hoped with his assistance to destioy the Assembly and establish their own ascendency. They had not, however, money enough to pay the troops, and were unable, owing to the resistance of the Sadrazam, to obtain possession of the proposed advance promised by England and Eussia, and moreover the Shoa’s unpopularity eclipsed even that of the Valiahd, who on his part did not fail to send conciliatory messages to the popular leaders. It was also known that the English and Eussian Legations would refuse their support to anv icactionaiy mo\ement and had already acknowledged the Valiahd as the legitimate successor of the Shah. Asa consequence, when the Shah’s illness took a more serious turn, and the hopes which the arrival of the German doctor had given rise to gave place to the conviction that His Majesty’s days were numbered, the Shoa’s party collapsed, and the Shah was induced to order the Valiahd to proceed to Tehran. It is stated, and generally believed, that the latter, in order to work on his father’s sympathies, represented that his life was in danger at Tabreez. As soon^ as possible after receiving the Shah’s orders the Valiahd started for Tehran, leaving Tabreez on the 4th December. He took with him all the armed horsemen he could collect, 400 in number, and most of his Persian suite. Of the foreign members of it, only M. Cavre, the French veterinary surgeon, accompanied the Prince. It had been agreed upon between M. Hartwig and myself that in case of the Shah’s death the previous precedents should be followed and the Eussian and English Consuls should accompany the Valiahd on his journey to Tehran. I had so informed Mr. Wratislaw, and instructed him to keep in touch with his Eussian colleague. On hearing of the Valiahd’s intended departure and that the Eussian Consul had ordered carriages for himself, Mr. Wratislaw wrote asking for his colleague’s intentions. He received no answer and telegraphed to me asking for instructions. I applied to M. Hartwig, who informed me that he thought it unnecessary that the Consuls should accompany the Valiahd, as the Shah was still alive. I concurred, and so informed Mr. AVratislaw, M. Hartwig at the same time sending corresponding instructions to his Consul. The latter in a telegram to M. Hartwig asserted, contrary to the facts, that it was not till Mr. AVratislaw had received his instructions from me that he had applied at the Russian Consulate for information as to his intentions. I have since learned that a Eussian officer of the Cossack Eegiment, Captain Khobaief, who had been dispatched to labreez four months before, accompanied the Valiahd on his journey, with the cavalry guard which he had organized, and who were armed with Eussian rifles and ammunition supplied from the Caucasus at a cost of about 40,000 roubles. Conversations had taken place in October between M. Hartwig and myself with regard to the advance which, as agreed on in May of last year, the two Governments might find it necessary to make in case of the Shah’s death, in order to facilitate the maintenance of order. M. Hartwig informed me that a sum of money had been supplied to the Eussian Bank at Tabreez in order, if necessary, to supply the Valiahd with the means of proceeding with a suitable guard to Tehran. The Valiahd approached Mr. Wratislaw / with regard to this matter, and suggested that the English Bank also should make him j an advance in case of necessity. I informed the Foreign Office of this application, I with M. Hartwig’s knowledge, and received the reply (on the 29th October), that there ' [2305 17] (No. 2.) Sir, [January 21.] Section 17.&lt;{ could, of course, be no question of giving the Yalialid money before tbe Shah’s death, and i that the matter need not be mentioned to the bank.” In a subsequent telegram (7th i November) you informed me that a sum would be placed at my order at the Imperial \ Bank immediately on the death of the Shah, and I was authorized to inform my Bussian colleague of the fact, although I was not to mention to him the conditions as to the interest and security. _ ^ ^ Under these circumstances, I informed M. Hartwig, in general terms, that I w r d he in a position after the Shah’s death to make the specified advance. He informec^ .e, in reply, that he would bear this in mind, and that, in the meantime, the Bussian Bank had been able to provide funds for the Yaliahd’s journey. .As a matter of fact the Yaliahd drew cheques on the Russian Bank before his departure for 170,000 tomans (about 33,000/.), and as a delegate from the Russian Bank met him on his arrival at Tehran, it is quite possible that a further advance may have been accorded him. The force with which he first started was soon increased by horsemen from the numerous villages which belonged to him on the road out of Tabreez, and it amounted at one time to over 4,000 men. The reason for this measure of precaution was probably the rumour that his brother, the Salar-ed-Dowleh, had collected a large force of Lur horsemen in the neighbourhood of Burujird, with which he intended, as it was believed, to cut off the Valiahd from Tehran. Fortunately, however, dissensions among the tribes and his own rapacity prevented him from taking action; and when the V aliahd arrived at Tehran his escort amounted to about 450 men, of whom 400 consisted of the force under Captain Khobaief’s control. In addition to this force, 300 Cossacks under Russian officers were sent out to meet him, and were “ echelonnes ” along the road leading to Tehran. The Russian Minister applied for an audience on the Yaliahd’s arrival, and His Imperial Highness instructed the Minister for Foreign Affairs to inform the heads of Missions that he would receive them separately with their staffs according to^ their diplomatic precedence. The Director of the Russian Bank, however, presented himself on the first day of reception, and before his own Minister, and was accorded a private audience. The Valiahd’s language to myself and to the members of His Majesty s Legation was most friendly. I studiously avoided politics, but His Imperial Highness, of his own accord, made tivo very friendly allusions to the new Assembly and the Parliamentary regime which his father had sanctioned. M. Hartwig informed me that he had also restricted himself in his first audience to generalities, but that in a second and private audience which has been accorded him he had strongly urged the necessity of increasing the sum of money allotted to the maintenance of the Cossack Brigade—a demand which Colonel Douglas tells me is fully justified by the facts. With regard to the political sympathies of the Valiahd, I have little to add to the information already supplied by Sir Arthur Hardinge in his despatches Nos. 125 ana 140 of the 10th and 23rd June, 1905. They are undoubtedly Russian. He has spent his life in a town which could at any time be occupied by Bussian troops, and in a province to a great extent under Russian influence. He speaks Russian himself, and has placed his son and heir under the care of a Russian tutor. He has received constant pecuniary advances from the Russian Government, including a loan of 100,000/, in 1905, when the high decoration of St. Amdrew was also conferred upon him. ^ On the other hand, there is reason to believe that on his accession to the throne he will revert to the traditional policy of his family and make some attempt to hold the balances even between ourselves and Russia. Shortly after his arrival he sent me a message to state that such was his intention, and he expressed the hope that he might be able to communicate directly with the King in the same manner as he had for some time been permitted to communicate with the Emperor of Russia. I understand that His Majesty has graciously complied with this request, and that the Yaliahd has expressed his gratitude and satisfaction to his entourage. In reply to the Yaliahd s message of friendly sympathy to His Majesty’s Legation, I stated that I quite understood that he was at the present moment under special obligations to Russia, and that he would have to respect her natural susceptibilities with regard to his relations with this Legation. At the same time. His Majesty’s Government was, I said, confident that when ie ascended the throne he would act as became the independent Sovereign of an independen nation, , In a subsequent interview with the Nizam-es-Saltaneh I learnt from him that t e Yaliahd w-as grateful for my message, and that since his arrival at Tehran he had seenthe necessity, in the interest of his own position and authority of asserting his he\v^“the n “ Vald ’’'of .V' 0 ^ « hiS 1?0Wert ? a T° id g:ving rise to the impression that he Was the Vakil of a foreign Sovereign. At the same time, I think it well to remain m the background, and I have not applied for a private audience, which I think miffht - grouse .Russian susceptibilities and would not lead to any useful result. ’ g With regard to the Valiahd’s attitude towards the constitutional movement, he has ' r‘pf“ ,*Tr P1 ' eS ! 11S . Sy J?.F at !'Z mthe ™ 0st °I )en and formal manner, and although . generally believed he is (like the majority of his Russian advisers) opposed in heart o popular liberties, he has certainly done all in his power to counteract this impression by accepting the Constitution without demur. I am informed that he is convinced that, tor the present at any rate, a good understanding with his people is the only alternative to complete subservience to Russia, and I am inclined to believe that the wise and temperate advice of the Russian Minister has also contributed to the peaceful solution ot what at one time threatened to be a dangerous conflict. Tn conclusion, I venture to express the opinion that he is gifted with a very considerable allowance of Persian dissimulation combined with some degree of practical intelligence. He is under great obligations to Russia, but, while conscious of this is anxious to maintain his independence; and while at heart opposed to the popular movement and ready to take advantage of any dissensions in the popular party he appears to feel that an open breach with his people would involve the necessity of appealing to Russian ^ support and the eventual loss of the sovereign power. On the other hand, I think it should be borne in mind that with his succession Russia will probably count on reaping the harvest of the long years of careful preparation and her assiduous courtship of the heir to the throne, and that it is not impossible, especially if the popular party (as is expected by some) collapses from its own vveakness and dissensions, and the process of &lt;c peaceful penetration ” may be greatly accelerated.

Letter proceeds to state that British and Russian Ministers are of opinion that these suspicions should be removed, and that a note should be addressed to Persian Prime Minister to the effect that, as more than two months have elapsed since the conditions on which the advance was to be made were communicated to Persian Government, and as the latter have not taken advantage of offer of financial assistance, the two Govern ments consider negotiations are null and void, and that their Representatives have received instructions to suspend credit of 200,000/., which had been opened in favour of the Persian Government. Letter adds that the Russian Government entirely share this view, and have no' objections to a note being addressed in the above sense to Prime Minister. Minister for Foreign Affairs asks me to ascertain opinion of His Majesty’s Government as soon as possible, and, if they concur, he will send necessary instructions to Russian Minister. (Letter ends.) (Confidential.) The later telegrams from Sir C. Spring-Rice seemed to indicate that there was now no objection to allowing matters to rest as they are, and I might communicate to Minister for Foreign Affairs those opinions, and ascertain his views before a final decision is taken. Unless circumstances imperatively call for an abandonment of joint advance, I venture to submit that it would be prudent to maintain it, as it preserves our common action, and has been a useful preliminary and help to our general negotiations as to Persia. I should be sorry to see it lost. Moreover, we might be opening the door to the intervention of Germany, a point which I might put before the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and possibly I could then see if there is any truth in the report that some arrangement has been come to between Russia and Germany. Without, absolutely accepting or declining the proposal of the Russian Government, I would suggest that I might lay before Minister for Foreign Affairs— Firstly, that as Valiahd has admitted financial control by Assembly, no advance would be made without its sanction, and that perhaps this might be allowed to be known generally at Tehran. Secondly, 1 might also suggest that inquiry be made of Russian and British Ministers if they still consider abandonment of advance is desirable. Thirdly, and also I might point out probability of application by Persian Govern ment to Germany, who might agree to supply financial aid, we having formally abandoned the field.fjy nn-i a COMaDEiSTIAT.

Following is the result of conversation with Russian Minister :— Popular movement against the loan is still strong, hut it is possible, owing to severe financial pressure, that the Valiahd and Grand Vizier may apply for loan, throwing the odium on us, on the ground that they acceded under pressure. The two Banks are obliged to restrict their advances to merchants owing to uncertainty as to whether advance will be asked for, and this gives rise to the impression that we are trying to force loan on the Government against the will of the people. We think that it would be advisable to inform Grand Vizier officially that the two Governments withdraw their offer, and let this be known. Otherwise the two Legations may be accused of contributing funds to the Government in order to suppress popular movement. 822—413!PERSIA. [December 10.] ( IFXDENTIAL. Section 2. [41278] No. 1.

ISVOLSKY mentioned to me yesterday that he had received information from Tehran to the effect that the Mollahs were raising difficnlties to the acceptance by the Persian Government of the advance which the Russian and British Governments were prepared to make to them. He understood that they required that the question should be submitted to the approval of the Legislative Assembly. M. Isvolsky added that he did not propose to put any pressure upon the Persian Government to accept the loan. The money was there, and was at their disposal if they were willing to accept it on the conditions which we had laid down. He inquired whether I was acquainted with your views on the subject. 1 told M. Isvolsky that I had received a telegram, announcing the fact that the Mollahs were raising difficulties, but that I was not acquainted with your views on the subject. I presumed that, as the Persian Government had taken the initiative in applying for a loan, there would be no intention of forcing one upon them, and that w r e should be content to wait till they had settled their domestic differences. M. Isvolsky said that he was of opinion that the Persian Government would not apply elsewhere for a loan, as he had given them to understand that German financiers were not disposed to advance money to Persia at this moment. I replied that as neither Russia nor England was placing difficulties in the way of the Persian Govern ment obtaining an. advance, there would be no reason for the latter to seek financial aid in other quarters. 1 added that I understood that both Governments were ready to give some financial assistance to the Valiahd on his accession to the throne. M. Isvolsky replied that this was the case ; but he trusted that the Persian Assem bly would not be troublesome in regard to the arrangement to which the two Governments would arrive with respect to Persia. He did not know if that body exercised much influence in the country, and if we should have to take it into account in completing our negotiations. I told M. Isvolsky that I had seen some - report, I could not for the moment recollect whether it was official or not, which had indicated that there was a certain indifference in the country towards the Assembly, but it was possible that the latter, like all young and novel institutions, would wish to play a prominent part in the affairs of the country. It was too early to judge of the measure in which the Assembly would control the Government. There were not a few well educated and intelligent Persians who would, doubtless, develop into active politicians, and I presumed that they would wish to make their influence felt. _ i/ I had the honour to inform you in my telegram No. 292 of the 14th instant what M. Isvolsky had said to me in regard to the advance. 4, { 1 { I have, &amp;c. ^ (Signed) A. NICOLSON.

Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received November 26.) (No. 280.) ^ r ’ . Tehran, November 9, 1906. 1 HAv E the honour to inform you that on the receipt of your telegram No. 169 A of the 3id ultimo 1 called on the Hussian Minister, who was then in his country residence, and communicated to him in writing the terms on which His Majesty’s Government were prepared to join the Hussian Government in making an advance* to Persia. Among these terms was the condition that our part of the loan should he guaranteed on the customs of the ports of South Persia and the Persian Gulf. He promised to draw up a draft Convention which we could submit to our Governments. I called again on the 13th ultimo and found M. Hartwig much depressed, owing to the difficulty which had arisen in St. Petersburg!! with regard to the terms of the loan. The Hussian Department of Pinance was insisting that the interest should he at the rate of 9 per cent., and that the advance should be repaid in March of next year. The latter condition was one which the Persian Government could not possibly comply with. He had urged this view on his Government but he had received no answer. I subsequently received communications from the Minister of Pinance and the Sadr-i-Azam, which were to the effect that the result of the condition, if insisted on, would he to force Persia to accept such terms for the larger loan which was in contemplation, as the lending Powers might choose to insist on, and they gave particulars as to M. Naus’ attempted loan in Belgium in July (see Sir Arthur/?^ Tlardinge s telegram No. 115 of the 26th July) and the loan negotiations in St. Petersburg!! in August. With regard to the latter, the Sadr-i-Azam’s account differs materially from that which Sir Arthur Nicolson received from M. Isvolsky, and is probably another instance of the familiar Persian policy of setting off one Government against the other. J On receipt of your telegram No. 190 of the 22nd October, I called onM. Hartwig and informed him that I was authorized to make the advance to the Persian Government as soon as he was similarly instructed and w r e were both satisfied that it would be devoted to the purposes for which it was intended. I also communicated to him the terms to which the Hussian Government had agreed, as reported by Sir Arthur Nicolson in his telegram of the 21st October. He told me that he had as yet received no reply whatever from his Government. He then showed me the draft Contract which he had submitted to his Government for their decision, and which provided for repayment of the advance after a period of two or three years out of the proceeds of a new loan. The guarantee of the loan made by each Power was to be the same as that of previous loans. He stated that the expression in your telegram, of the 3rd ultimo “the customs of the ports of South Persia and the Persian Gulf ” was objectionable, as it w r as inconsistent with the original loan contract made by Hussia. He added that there was no objection to the English claim for Mohammerah, as this debarred the Persian Government from treating the customs of that port as unaffected by either the Hussian or the English loan contracts, and therefore free to be assigned to some third Power. But there were great objections to extending the English guarantee to the ports outside the Gulf as they were especially interesting to Hussia. The remark was one of a private character, but seemed to have some importance if viewed in connection with the Hussian Memo randum which I communicated from St. Petersburg!! in December 1903, which showed that Charbar was the port recommended to the Hussian military authorities for the termination of their projected railway. In view of his objections to your proposal, I followed the alternative course approved of by you in your telegram No. 279 of the 13th ultimo, and informed him that His Majesty’s Government would consent to the guarantee being the same as that of the previous loans; but I added, for his own private information, that I would [2216 cc—4]2 address a note to the Persian Government, stating that His Majesty's Government adhered to that interpretation of the obligations of Persia with regard to the southern ports, which they had always maintained. No discussion took place on the subject, and our conversation was of a private and informal character. On the next day (the 24th ultimo) I called on the Sadr-i-Azam, who informed me that he had just received a telephone message from the Russian Minister that his'V Government had agreed to the loan. I explained to his Highness that the money would not he paid unless both Legations were satisfied that it would he devoted to the actual expenditure of the Government for administrative purposes. He raised objections on the score of the “honour of the Shah” and the “independence of the Persian Government,” hut 1 attempted to make it clear to him that this condition was regarded hv both Governments as a sine qua non. The next day (the 25th ultimo) I went to the Russian Legation, where I met the Director of the Russian Bank. In conformity with the instructions received from the Russian Government, a draft contract was drawn up, the text of which I telegraphed to you the same day. It provided for interest at the rate of 7 per cent., and for repayment, on demand, after four months’ notice. You will have observed that the clause defining the British guarantee is in the same sense as that in our previous loan contracts, with the omission of the Caspian fisheries, an amendment to which I consented, as no revenues are now derived from them. As the revenues of the posts and telegraphs are less than the interest on the previous loans, the real guarantee remains the revenue of the Gulf ports. I thought it my duty to telegraph the objections raised by the Russian Minister as to the expression “ the ports of Southern Persia,’ as it was evident that he had not been informed by M. Isvolsky that the Russian Government had accepted the terms conveyed in the' written Memorandum communicated by Sir Arthur Nicolson, an acceptance which, indeed, M. Isvolsky appears to have subsequently described as an expression of his purely personal views (Sir Arthur Nicolson s telegram No. 264 of the 11th ultimo). Having received your approval of the draft contract, I arranged with M. Hart wig to call together at the office of the Sadr-i-Azam, where, in the presence of the Minister of Finance, we discussed the terms of the advance. The Sadr-i-Azam objected strongly to the clause providing that the two Govern ments could demand repayment at four months’ notice, and we agreed to telegraph to our Governments his request for a year’s grace. Having finally received the terms which the two Governments had agreed to, which provided that, after the elapse of nine months, repayment could be demanded on three months’ notice, we called again on the Sadr-i-Azam (the 3rd instant) and informed him of the new condition, which he accepted. A long discussion then took place with regard to the manner in which the Persian Government should apply for the payment of the advance. The Russian Minister and I explained to him in the clearest terms that we would require to satisfy ourselves that the money asked for was really expended for Government purposes. The Sadr-i-Azam finally consented to submit to us a draft note, which he promised for the next day. r- In order to comply with the instructions contained in your telegram No. 195 I stipulated, and M. Hartwig agreed, that the Persian demands shall be addressed to the two Legations in identic notes, so that each Minister should give his consent to the payment of one-half of each separate item. Up to the time of writing, the draft note which the Sadr-i-Azam promised to submit has not been received, and the contract has not been signed. As soon as this has been done, I shall have the honour of sending a copy, together with that of my note to the Persian Government relative to the southern ports, which was approved in your telegram No.^lQS of the 25th ultimo.

His instructions were probably sent by Einancial Department, under the inspiration of M. Grube, who is opposed to joint action with us. In order to preserve harmony it might be pointed out— 1. That, when the Grand Vizier makes a formal demand, the question of granting it may be considered on its merits, but that the case has not yet arisen. 2. That immediate communication to the Valiahd is obviously inopportune. 3. That the Russian Government have approved of our attitude of reserve (see Sir A. Nicolson’s telegram No. 292), which has been so far successful, as there is as yet no trace of an anti-foreign movement. The only way I can keep the popular party from appealing to this Legation is by insisting that both we and Russia have determined not to interfere in domestic politics.

If the Persian Government require money we have made our offer, and it is for him to accept or refuse it, under the conditions we have laid down, publicly and on his own respon sibility. If there is strong popular opposition he cannot accept advance publicly, and we have refused to make it secretly. We can only deal with recognized organ of Persian Government. To do otherwise would be to take part in internal politics, which we wish to avoid. 2. As regards our informing the Valiahd, he has publicly expressed his respect for the Assembly, which has to-day sent a deputation to discuss with him questions of the Constitution and finance. Under these circumstances, it would be unwise for us to take any action which would have the appearance of taking sides or pressino* unpopular loan on his acceptance. Attitude of both Legations since we made the offer of the advance has been one of observation and abstention. It has, I believe, been appreciated by both parties, and I think it wiser to maintain it. (Confidential.) If we attempt to induce Government to accept our advance, popular party is likely enough to take a strong turn against Pussia and England, and, if in absolute need of foreign financial assistance, to seek it elsewhere.

We had not come to any general settlement about Persia. It might take a long time to arrive at that. But the object of this joint loan was to keep the discussion open between us, and to enable Persia to carry on meanwhile. The Ambassador remarked that the loan was a much smaller one than some previous loans to Persia in which Russia had indulged. I replied that this was so, no doubt because there had been no understanding between Russia and us, there had been a temptation in the past for one country to lend unduly large sums to Persia, in order to secure an advantage in Persia over the other country. But when we made a loan jointly there could be no question of outbidding each other, and there was every reason for keeping the loan to the smallest amount required by the necessities of the case. Further, the joint loan was a proof that, though we might still be a long way from arriving at a general settlement between ourselves as to Persia, when difficulties arose in that country we already discussed them together. 1 explained again that if a general settlement was reached it would be in the nature of an agreement that each should abstain from interference in the portion of Persia which bordered on the frontier of the other. We were not thinking of dividing Persia or interfering with its integrity. [A] CONFIDENTIAL. PERSIA. [October 24.] Section 3. [36096] No. 1. (No. 185 A.) Sir, Sir Edward Grey to Sir C. MacDonald.

Goubastoff, tbe Assistant Minister for Eoreign Affairs, this afternoon, and said that I wished to speak to him in regard to the terms on which our joint advance was to he made to the Persian Government. I believed that both the Representatives at Tehran were of opinion that the conditions should not be too onerous on Persia, and it seemed to my Government that a rate of interest at 5 per cent, would be sufficient. This was, I understood, the rate of interest charged on the Russian loans, and we might adopt it in the present instance. M. Goubastoff observed that the question was in reality one for the Minister of Einance to decide, and that he believed that the Persian Government were ready to accept a rate of 9 per cent., which was below the normal rate of interest in Persia. He thought that it would be better to maintain the above-mentioned rate. I pointed out to M. Goubastoff that possibly if we insisted on too high a rate the Persian Government might endeavour to obtain easier terms from the newly-created German Bank. This his Excellency considered as highly improbable. After some further conversation I suggested that we should split the difference, and adopt 7 per cent, as the rate of interest. M. Goubastoff asked if I were authorized to accept that rate, and I told him that such was the case, though my Government considered that 5 per cent, was more reasonable. M. Goubastoff said that he would speak to the Minister of Einance and let me know his reply. I then alluded to the date of repayment, and said that it was out of the question to imagine that the Persian Government would be in a position to reimburse us for our advance at so early a date as the middle of next March, and that it would be far better to leave the date on which repayment should be made quite open; in fact, no date should be fixed. It would always be possible for the two Governments, after giving timely notice, say three or six months, to the Persian Government to demand repayment of the advance, and we would thus be at liberty to choose our own time for doing so. M. Goubastoff readily agreed to this view, and said that he would ask the Minister of Einance for his assent, always on the understanding that, after a preliminary notice of a few months, the demand for repayment should be made. I begged M. Goubastoff to give me a definite reply on the two above-mentioned points with as little delay as possible. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. NICOLSON. [2173 ff —14]CON 1'IDENTJAL. Sir A.

Nicolson has also been instructed, 15th October, in reply to representations from Russian Government that interest should be 9 per cent, and date of repayment March next, that terms as to interest and repayment of British and Russian advances must be identical, but that Russian proposals, especially in regard to date of repayment, seem rather stiff. With reference to Isvolsky’s opinion that date of repayment should be early in order to secure opportunity for general settlement with Persia, Nicholson is instructed that the most important matter is a general understanding between Great Britain and Russia, which is not dependent on the date of repayment by Persia of first portion of the present advance.Sir A.

Minister for Foreign Affairs thinks it would be more prudent not to connect what would practically delimit spheres of influence with the comparatively trifling matter of an advance. He is of opinion that question of spheres of influence should be discussed and arranged when we take up the whole question of loan in common, on which he hopes to be able to speak to me in a day or two. He considers that, in regard to advance, it would be wise on account of considerations mentioned in above-mentioned telegram that we should limit ourselves— 1. To postponing repayment by the Persian Government of advances to Imperial Bank of Persia and Pussian Bank; 2. To our contenting ourselves with a lien on customs of ports in south of Persia and Persian Gulf; and 3. To our furnishing our moiety of advance at once, Russian Government supplying their share in five or six months’ time. Russian Government, owing to necessity of obtaining legislative sanction, and for other considerations, will find it inconvenient to advance their share immediately.

Isvolsky s opinion that there should be an early date of repayment in order to secure an opportunity of a general settlement with Persia, I would observe that there are sure to be other opportunities of doing this, and that the most important matter will be to come to a general understanding with Russia, which is naturally not dependent upon the date of repayment of the first portion of this advance to Persia.CONFIDENTIAL. ■oeMirx 16 OCT 1906 t 45ll dep&amp;&gt;' Sir C.

I hear that Persian Government declares its inability to accept terms now offered, and the rumour of larger loan is already exciting popular discontent. Meanwhile there is great scarcity of money at Tehran, and loan is urgently needed. (Confidential.) Effect of latest Russian proposal will be to force Persian Government to accept offei of a larger loan, say of 2 million, to meet present exigencies.

Secondly, that Russia now borrows money at about 7 per cent, (see rate of 1906 loan), and is forced to ask higher interest from Persia. Thirdly, term of repayment fixed is an impossible condition. Fourthly, in view of popular movement against all foreign Government loans it is most undesirable to impose hard conditions, and Persian Government might make private arrangement behind our backs with new German bank for the purpose of a loan without term at 8 or 9 per cent. With regard to new and larger loan this is regarded as essential by M. Naus and desirable by Russian Treasury, but it probably will arouse great popular outbreak here, and His Majesty’s Government will be unable, I presume, to take part in it.

They consider that, as normal rate of interest in Persia is 12 per cent., their proposed rate is not high, and also if a low rate like 5 per cent, is now demanded this would prejudice rate of interest on the loan which may hereafter he made.

Hie loan would be secured on some guarantees and concessions, and among the latter would figure the establishment of a German bank in Persia. I lie name oi the German bank which was conducting the negotiations was not given to him but he presumed that it must be the Deutsche Bank. His Excellency said that possi bly the figures which had been furnished to him were exaggerated, as he could not imagine that any bank would make so large an advance without any security, especially in the present condition of Persia. But he had no doubts as to the main facts of what had been reported to him, and it seemed to him of urgency that immediate steps should be adopted to block the scheme by the British and Russian Government making a joint advance. I thanked his Excellency cordially for having been so frank with me, and I quite agreed with him that no time should be lost in preventing the Persian Government from pursuing the negotiations with the German Bank. I would at once telegraph to you and beg for an early reply. M. Isvolsky said that he understood that a repayment was due to the Imperial Bank 'd-of Persia at the end of this month, and there were also sums due immediately to the Russian Bank. lie thought it would be desirable to endeavour to arrange for the postponement of these repayments, and to limit our joint advance to the strict require ments of the situation.

IS VOLSKY sent me word yesterday afternoon that he would like to call upon me, as he wished to speak to me on certain matters. His Excellency paid me a visit in the course of the afternoon, and said that he wished to inform me that the Persian G-overnment had been pressing the Eussian Minister at Tehran to procure for them an immediate advance of 3,000,000 tomans (about 500,000/. ', and also a loan of 10,000,000 tomans (about 1,650,000/.). They had stated to M. Hart wig that their financial condition was exceedingly precarious, and that if his Government would render them the above service, they would subscribe to any conditions which might be required. They further added that the British Government had been offering them financial assistance in return for concessions of a political character, but that they preferred to address themselves in the first instance to the Eussian Government. They intimated that if neither the Eussian nor the British Government were disposed to assist them they would apply to Germany. M. Isvolsky said that Sir C. Spring-Eice had written a private note to Count Lamsdorff in January last, which had remained without a written reply; but that on the note, which M. Isvolsky produced from his portfolio, Count Lamsdorff had written a Minute to the effect that he had informed Sir C. Spring-Eice verbally that the Eussian Government were in ‘accord with the principles enunciated in his com munication. M. Isvolsky observed that he wished to act in harmony with the spirit of what he termed the “ tacit agreement ” of January last, and he had therefore communicated to me the steps which the Persian Government had recently taken. There was, he said, little doubt that the financial condition of Persia was almost desperate, and that he wished to consult with His Majesty’s Government as to the best means of affording relief, and in what measure assistance could be rendered. He would be glad to know what information I had received in regard to the financial situation in Persia, and also what were the views of His Majesty’s Government on the subject. I told M. Isvolsky that, in the first place, I was sure that my Government would highly appreciate the loyal and frank step which he had been good enough to take ; and that, in the second place, I could assure him that no offer of any kind had been made to the Persian Government on our part, and that their assertion that financial relief had been tendered was an old device of the Persian authorities. I had no special data at that moment in my memory as to the financial condition of Persia, but that I had little doubt that it was extremely unsatisfactory. I did not know what view you would take as to the best means of overcoming the financial difficulty, but it seemed to me that it would be desirable, in the first place, to obtain some expert and trustworthy information as to the amount which would be needed to meet the most pressing necessities, and that then the two Governments might consult together as to whether an advance might not be made in common. Perhaps it might be found necessary to have some control as to the expenditure of the advance, if one were made, as' otherwise the funds might be squandered uselessly. I added that it would be better if the Persian Government could be restrained from applying to other quarters, such as Germany, for financial assistance. To this latter remark M. Isvolsky fully agreed, and said that, as both Eussia and Great Britain had large interests in Persia, it was desirable that they should work together without the intervention of third parties. His Excellency said that these and other matters concerning the present situation in Persia which Sir C. Spring-Eice and M. Hartwig might discuss were not to prejudice auy arrangement which the Governments of Great Britain and Eussia might hereafter conclude in regard to our future respective relations and attitude towards the general question of Persia. I said that this was also, I knew, the view r of my Government. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. NICOLSON. [2140 k— 2][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.!

I THAHK you for your letter inclosing the copy of the Prime Minister’s telegram, and I placed them before my colleagues yesterday. They were of the same opinion that I expressed to you verbally on Monday, that while the Imperial Bank was desirous of meeting the wishes of the Prime Minister in every way, yet that their first duty was to their shareholders, and that the overdraft of the Persian Government must be paid in order to legalize our position. We had already gone beyond the legal limit of our Concession, with the object of assisting the Persian 'Government at a critical time, His Imperial Majesty personally guaranteeing the repayment of the advance at a fixed date now fast approaching. The Directors are sure that His Majesty would insist upon his promise to the Bank being duly honoured, and they have no doubt that this can easily be done by a deposit of gold from the Private Treasury, which the Bank are quite ready to hold for a year, and to return to the Treasury when the overdraft is liquidated in any more convenient or agreeable manner. This can cause no difficulty. In any case, the Bank confidently rely upon the due fulfilment of His Majesty’s engagement. Believe me, &amp;c. (Signed) LEPEL GBIPPIN. Inclosure 4 in No. 1. Mirza Mehdi Khan to Sir L. Griffin. (Private.) Dear Sir Lepel Griffin, Persian Legation, September 14, 1906. 1 HAVE just received your letter of yesterday’s date, and I learn with regret the decision of the Board. I told you on Monday what I thought as regards the gold to which you referred, and do you for one moment think that if it was at all possible for His Imperial Majesty and the Government to pay this amount in some form or another they would defer it ? I will certainly telegraph, if you wish, the purport of your letter. But my personal and sincere opinion, not only as acting on behalf of the Government, but having the interests of the Imperial Bank at heart, is that as it is impossible for the Government to do anything at the present moment, and in view of the tone of the message the Sadre Azam has addressed to you through me, it would be much more conciliatory, and more in accordance with the traditions of the Imperial Bank in their relations with the Imperial Government that, even if you do not wish to give the time required, you would give about six months or so (and the only thing that can be done at the present moment is to give time). You can then mention, if you like, the question of gold at the same time, saying that you have received reports to that effect, and, under these circumstances, in your opinion the Government should have made a deposit at once, but in order to meet the wishes of the Sadre Azam you will wait a little longer (six months, or any time you Avish to propose), and that you expect them to make preparations for making a deposit by the end of that time. This, as I venture to think you will agree with me, Avill have double effect: first, it will prove the conciliatory spirit of the Imperial Bank, and their desire to assist the Government' in every way, and to accede to the first request the Sadre Azam has made; second, it Avill enable you to ascertain whether the report you have received in regard to gold is correct Avithout in any way offending the Sadre Azam. I hope you will realize the sincerity of the suggestion I venture to make as a well-wisher of the Bank, and will authorize me to telegraph to this effect. Should you wish to see me on the subject to-monw I Avill be pleased to call on you any time convenien to you. Yours sincerely, (Signed) MEHDI. r3 Inclosure 5 in Iso. 1. Sir L.

At the beginning of this month it became apparent, however, that the Persian government was m serious need of pecuniary assistance, in order to meet the regular charges ^ of the Administration; and, from information which had reached His Majesty s Government and the Russian Government, it was clear that, should such assistance not otherwise be forthcoming, requests of the Persian Government would to the serious prejudice of the interests of Great Britain and Russia, be more favourably entertained in other quarters. ■ Th ® ^ ^°vernments accordingly decided, after consultation with their represen tatives at rehran, that it would be expedient to make, in equal moieties, an immediate advance ot 200,000/. to the Persian Government, and a further advance of 200 000/ at a later date ; and they agreed that no portion of this loan should be applied to the repayment of former loans negotiated through the Imperial Bank of Persia or the Russian Banque des Prets. It is proposed that the mode of application of the contemplated loan and the details of repayment should be decided at Tehran or St. Petersburgh forthwith. Sir Edward Grey has been in consultation with the India Office °on the subject and it has been agreed that the British moiety of the advance shall be made in equal portions from Indian and Imperial funds, and shall be secured on the customs of the ports of Southern Persia and the Persian Gulf. The rate of interest will be the same as in the case of the advances to the Persian Government in April 1903 and September 1904. It is therefore proposed that the Government of India should at once provide a sum of 50,000/. to enable the Imperial Bank of Persia to make an advance of that amount to the Persian Government at 5 per cent, interest, of which 4 per cent, would be remitted as received to the Government of India, while the Bank would retain a commission of 1 per cent, per annum for its services in the matter. I am accordingly to request that, if the Lords Commissioners concur in the above proposal, which has already formed the subject of verbal communications with your Department, the necessary instructions may be issued in order that a sum of 50,000/. may be paid, under similar conditions, from Imperial funds to the Imperial Bank of Persia for the purpose in question.

('V T-'P '^T/jAA/'^ ST. PETERSBURG, ^ September 13th, 1906. Sir :- I called on Monsieur Isvolsky this afternoon and informed him that His Majesty’s Government were ready to join in an advance to the Persian Government and that the conditions as to the mode of disposing of the money and of securing its proper application, which were proposed hy the British and Russian Repre sentatives in Teheran,met v/ith your approval. In view,however,of the unstable situation in Persia, my Government considered that it would he necessary to secure some guarantees for their moiety of the ad vance. With this object,we proposed that we should have a lien in addition to that which we already held upon the Customs of the Southern and Gulf ports. Moreover we considered it necessary that we should obtain an undertaking from the Persian Government that they would not grant to other Powers concessions for railv/ays,roads or telegraphs in the district which lay to the east of a line drawn from Birjand to Bunder Abbas. I observed to His Excellency that. Grey, Bart., M.P., &amp;c., &amp;c. thoughthough of course I knew that the Russian Government had no designs in those quarters, still it was quite possible thax oxher Powers, desirous of affording fi nancial assistance to Persia,or of establishing an industrial or commercial footing in that country, might seek to develop the resources of provinces where it would be inconvenient for us to see foreign enterprise,and consequently foreign influence introduced. Monsieur Isvolsky said thax he understood this, and enquired what guarantees the Russian Government could demand for their share of the advance. I told him that west of the line which I had mentioned there was ample scope for securing the necessary guarantees, and it seemed to me that the Russian Government would have no difficulty in safeguarding their interests in the northern and western portions of Persia. His Excellency said that he was unable to give me a reply offhand, and that he would be very graxe- ful if I would give him a 'notice' containing our propositions, and that he trusted, I would let him have it as soon as possible. I told him that I would have no objection to doing this, but 'a titre tres confidentiel', and that as I had to despatch mymy. teg this evening I could only let him have ‘Ohe notice to-morrow at the earliest. His Excellency said that he mentioned his de sire to have the notice as soon as possible, as he had received information that a delegate from the German Bank was to arrive at Teheran at the end of this month, that is in less than three weeks. He was afraid that if either of us, or both of us, im posed conditions of the nature which I had described, the Persian Government would immediately acquaint ( the German Delegate with their character, and that the latter would, as he had previously told me, prob ably express his readiness to make the necessary ad vances without any conditions at all. In that case the Persian Government would feel no hesitation as to which offer they should accept. Monsieur Isvolsky did not appear to be surprised at the conditions which I had communicated to him, nor did he seem disposed to offer any objections to them. But I think that he would prefer that the ad vances should be made without guarantees, so as to place our offers in as favourable a light as possible toto the Persian Government, and preclude them from listening to the temptations which may he held out to them hy German financiers.

Sir:- I informed Monsieur Isvolsky yesterday that His Majesty's Government had received some months ago an application from the Persian Government for a loan, hut that the latter had been told that this reouest • III. | [ ■ JL n 'tMm could not be entertained. In respect to the recent application for an advance and a loan, I told His Ex cellency that ray Government v/ere of opinion that if some financial aid were really required and if the Persian Government v/ere likely to seek it elsewhere than in England and Russia, you v/ere prepared to send instructions to His Majesty's Charg§ d*Affaires at Teheran to ascertain, in conjunction with the Russian Minister, what amount would suffice to meet urgent requirements and also what means could he taken to assure that the advance was properly applied. In respect Sir E. Grey, Bart. M.P. &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Irespect to a loan I said that you considered that. owing to the condition of the health of the Shah and the uncertainty of the immediate political future in Persia, it would he advisable to defer, if possible. embarking on so serious a matter as a loan. More over as we understand that the Russian Government were in accord with us in supporting the succession of the Vaiiahd it would be advisable to enable His Highness to start his reign with our common financial assis tance should a loan be eventually necessary. I had prefaced my remarks, as I am sure you would have wished me to do, by expressing your appreciation of I the loyal and friendly communication which His Excel lency had made to me, as reported in my despatch No.575 of the 1st Instant. Monsieur Isvolsky took note of v/hat I had said, and stated that he would telegraph to the Russian Minister to place himself in communication with Mr. Grant Duff. He added that he presumed that the British and Russian Representatives at Teheran were not them selves $ tl f( re 6 U i- 1 Ml4 Id itble, Te nt were of the tee I 6 i 6 - e of :cel- O themselves to decide the amount and mode ot making the advance, hut merely to procure the necessary in- formation tor the suoseQuent decision of their respective Governments.

St. Petersburgh, September 23, 1906, 7'40 p.m. MIN ISTER/ for Foreign Affairs told me this afternoon that Minister of Finance agreed with him as to our line from Birjand to Bunder Abbas, and that Russia should find her sphere of interest in the north of Persia. These were their personal views, and they had now to persuade Emperor and the General Staff to agree with them. He added that if Russia wished to construct railways in her sphere she would have to apply for neutral capital, i.e. , Belgian and Dutch, not French. He further remarked that our line cut off a zone which had political and strategical importance, and he did not know how General Staff would regard it, hut as the main object of any future arrangement was to prevent collisions, he and the Minister of Finance were personally in favour of it. I told him that his proposed sphere was also of political and strategical import ance, and we were therefore on an equal footing. I added that it was of paramount importance to us that we should obtain our sphere. I asked if, pending an arrangement of the whole question, we could not make my proposed exchange of the two telegraph lines, as I now foresaw that [? negotiations] might last a little time. He begged that the question of telegraph lines should come in with the whole question. I did not say “Yes” or “ No,” but I will press for its being treated separately if you wish. The Emperor may not be back before the end of this week, but the difficulty evidently will be with tbe General Staff. I propose now to confine my negotiations to Persia, leaving Thibet and Afghanistan alone for the moment./4 (% CONFIDENTIAL. .bfv^ /(.

The matter therefore at present stands as follows:— An immediate advance of 100,000/. to be made by each Government, we taking lien on southern customs as guarantee for our share, and the Imperial Bank of Persia and Russian Bank agreeing to postpone asking for reimbursement of sums due to them. If more than 200,000/. is found necessary for immediate necessities, the Russian Government, in that case, may have to apply to me to assist them.

From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 24£A September 1906. Foreign Secret. Persia. Your telegrams of 19th September 1906. The foundation of the case that you are good enough to offer for con- sideration, seems to be described in the Commander-in-Chief’s proposition that “ in the present state of affairs in Russia any general settlement in Persia would he very inopportune.” The point of opportuneness, however, is not a military, but a poiitical question; and a political question to be decided by His Majesty’s Government not exclusively on Indian grounds, but on the broadest consideration of Imperial policy. His Majesty’s Government have decided that the present state of affairs in Russia, the state of affairs in Persia, and the possible attitude of at least one other European Power as to Persian questions, all make it eminently desirable to create or seize an opportunity of coming to terms with Russia, while vigilantly guarding the whole body of our own legitimate and solid interests, both Indian and Rritish, both military and commercial. One paragraph in your telegram points to an alternative policy—a “gradual process” of Russian absorption, “ lasting perhaps 40 years, and retarded at every step by diplomatic action,” so giving us time “ to adapt our defence schemes to changed conditions.” When we talk of maintenance of the status quo for 40 years, let us realise what it means. Forty more years of consular rivalries, ^ spurious plague-doctoring, telegraph contention, international machinations, endless fluctuating and extremely expensive strategical speculations in India, and finally a Persia deliberately and imperatively shut out from the benefits of modern civilisation by entanglements with Western Powers professing a civilising mission—this is a prospect not to be regarded with entire equanimity, and His Majesty’s Government have decided to make a determined attempt to find a different course. Without discussing in detail the relative advantages to us of the Bunder- Abbas-Birjand line and the Khanikin-Kain line, as divisions of interest between Great Britain and Russia, you will, I believe, agree that the proposal of the Khanikin line, which has been made by the Government of India before now, even if it were accepted, could hardly be expected to last. The line would eventually have to be held by force, and this w*ould really mean the annexation of Southern Persia. The line suggested by His Majesty’s Government is not to be held as a military frontier, and they are hostile to the annexation of any part of Persia. Among other objections you urge that the Bunder Abbas line opens ports west of that place to foreign Powers and gives them opportunities of constructing railways and fortifications for naval bases. Reference is made to Lord Lansdowne’s well-known statement of policy in the House of Lords. But Lord Lansdowne expressly disclaimed any desire to exclude the legitimate trade of other Powers from the Gulf. On the other hand, a naval base, or fortified port, he said, would be a very grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal. There is no departure from this position in the suggestions of His Majesty’s Government in the present negotiations. You will not fail to observe that none of the conditions to be attached to the joint loan _ authorise either Great Britain or Russia to take any action inconsistent with the independence and integrity of Persia; this, both sides will be pledged to respect. No question therefore arises of military occupation or fortification. The same consideration furnishes the reply to your apprehensions as to the Bunder Abbas line leading to increased naval expenditure in the vicinity of the Gulf, and to the possible necessity of a large military force to hold the Bunder-Abbas-Seistan line.16 FOREIGN SECKET TELEGRAMS.

Meanwhile I wish you to recognise the mischiefs of the subsisting case, Bussia taking small steps forward, which Persia is powerless to resist, which we cannot reasonably treat as grounds for war, and which we cannot effectively and permanently counter by means short of war.

I did not allude to joint guarantee of customs in Western ports of the Gulf, as it seemed unnecessary for the moment. He asked if I would give him a memorandum as soon as possible as to our proposals and 1 said I would do so very confidentially. “ The Emperor is on a yachting cruise till next Tuesday, and Minister for Foreign Affairs will have to submit the matter to His Majesty’s consideration.” On 17th instant he sent two following telegrams : — (a) “ My telegram 14th instant. Minister for Foreign Affairs thinks it would be more prudent not to connect what would practically delimit spheres of influence with the comparatively trifling matter of an advance. He is of opinion that question of spheres of influence should be discussed and arranged when we take up the whole question of loan in common on which he hopes to be able to speak to me in a day or two. He considers that in regard to advance it would be wise, on account of considerations mentioned in above-mentioned telegram, that we should limit ourselves— “ (1) to postponing repayment by the Persian Government of advances to Imperial Bank of Persia and Russian Bank ; &lt;£ (2) to our contenting ourselves with a lien on customs of ports in south of Persia and Persian Gulf; and— “ (3) to our furnishing our moiety of advance at once, Russian Govern ment supplying their share in five or six months’ time.

On the contrary, he considered that we should deliminate our respective spheres of influence as soon as possible, but not associate them with a simple advance or even a serious loan. “He hoped to be able to give me the opinions of the Emperor and his colleagues in a day or two, and in the meanwhile he begged me not to telegraph officially on the subject. “ He hinted that in Russian sphere of influence access to some part ot Gulf would be necessary. I on my part hinted that I did not think that this would presenkan insuperable difficulty.” 'Of to AFOREIGN SECRET TELEGRAMS. Secret Department. From Viceroy, September 1906. Foreign Secret. Your telegrams of 12th September and 14th September. TV e respectfully would point out thatbefore the receipt of Grant Duff’s telegram of 9tb September we had received no intimation whatever of the possible intention of His Majesty’s Government to grant a joint loan with Russia to Persia, and our remarks about Bunder Abbas-Bam road were based upon report in Grant Duff’s telegram of 2nd September that a secret loan was being negotiated independently by Persia with Russia. We now learn that a joint loan is contemplated on basis of general settlement of Persian question, and that instructions in regard to that settlement were sent to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg on 12th September. Matter is one we consider vitally affecting interests and safety of India, and though we may not fully have understood nature of proposals as necessarily set out in brief in your telegram, we venture with greatest respect to offer certain remarks on those proposals as indicated in your telegram of 14th September in hope that these may be considered before any arrangement is finally effected. In series of despatches and telegrams, extending from Despatch of 21st September 1899 from Lord Curzon’s Government to Lord Minto’s telegram of 9th January 1906, Government of India have consistently advised that Foreign Powers should be excluded from owning ports in Persian Gulf and that line south of which no concessions for roads, railways, or telegraphs should be granted to any Power other than Great Britain was line from Khanikia to north of Birjand. That policy was practically endorsed by Lard Lansdowne’s statement to the Shah on 21st August 1902 and his further declaration in the House of Lords on the 6th May 1903. Government of India therefore view with gravest apprehension drawing line of concessions as far east as Bunder Abbas, which will open up all the ports west of that place to Foreign Powers with possible concessions for railways leading down to such ports and fortification of naval bases. This must inevitably lead t.o necessity for maintaining strong naval force in Persian Gulf able to cope with foreign squadrons that may be stationed there with resultant ] serious charge on British revenues. In any case, useful though route may be as means of supporting Seistan, it would be difficult if not impossible to hold Bunder Abbas-Seistan line without large force if hostile port were to be made at Lin gab, and if Kerman were to pass under control of strong military power and to be linked up by railway with Tehran. Further, we have it on record that expert Railway Officer reported, after careful local examination in 1903, that possible route for railway with grades not exceeding one in forty leads from Ahwaz to Shiraz and Kerman and then to Nushki. If Baghdad Railway is ever constructed this line will be of importance as direct commercial route to India, and it is desirable it should be in our sphere of concessions. Based as it would be on sea in West and with connecting line to Bunder Abbas it would give us strong com mercial and political hold on Southern Persia. Proposed line would sacrifice this and would also expose our commerce in the Gulf, now over eighty per cent, of total, to serious risk of prohibitive tariffs and obstruction in Persian ports. It would also so weaken our present predominant position in the Gulf as to render it impossible for us to exercise much influence on the outlet of the Baghdad Railway or even to hold our own on the Arabian coast, while our pledges to Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit would become incapable of execution. Finally, we venture to demur to proposal to allow Russian loan to be secured on customs of all principal ports in Gulf except Bunder Abbas, as these are already pledged as security for Indian10 19 / Secret Department. foreign seceet telegrams. loans. If His Majesty’s Government, for reasons of which we liave no knowledge, hold that we must recede from Khanikin-Birjand line and that limit of Russian or foreign concessions caunot be confined to north of that line, we would suggest as better settlement line from Mohammerah to Kain which, while abandoning nearly all valuable portion of Persia, including both capitals, Tehran and Ispahan, would be free from gravest objections of the Bunder Abbas-Birjand line. It is understood that at present only a line of concessions is under consideration and not a line of occupation . We had, indeed, contemplated that if Russia should ultimately succeed m absorbing part of Persia, we might be obliged to concentrate (?) upon Bunder Abbas-Birjand line as last parallel in Persia against Russian advance. But such absorption was not inevitable, and would in any case have been gradual process lasting perhaps 40 vears, and retarded at every step by diplomatic action. We should then have had time to adapt our defence schemes to changed conditions. Present proposal will precipitate unopposed Russian advance, and may find our defensive preparations inade quate. Therefore, rather than accept Bunder Abbas-Birjand line now, we would prefer to make loan on former security merely to tide over present difficulty without further definite concessions, though an exchano'e of Meshed-Tehran for Meshed-Seistan telegraph might perhaps be arranged. Against such a settlement as that indicated in your telegram of 14th September, in the light of such information as we possess” we therefore venture most respectfully but strongly to protest in the interests of India, and we trust in no case shall we be called on to provide funds for any advance or loan for such a measure, or to contribute towards the heavy naval and military expenditure which will inevitably hereafter be entailed thereby. Lord Kitchener is on tour, and we have not obtained his opinion. Foreign Secret. My telegram of the 19th September. Persian Loan. Following telegram received from Lord Kitchener is transmitted in continuation :— “I think that it is of great importance that status quo should be maintained in Persia, and hope that action taken will prevent recent Russian aggression on telegraph line. With regard to possible loan and its consequences, I look upon proposed terms of negotiations with Russia as very dangerous to our interests in Persia as they would allow Russia, in my opinion, far more than she is in any way entitled to, or would probably ask for herself. I think that, in present state of affairs in Russia, any general settlement in Persia would be very inopportune, and I fear that what is proposed could not be a permanent solution. Rather than the proposals of His Majesty’s Government, I would prefer, in case of a loan, to leave things as they are, and allow Russia to make her own terms for security with Persia without any agreement on our part in them. Persia would, of course, be told that in any such arrangement with Russia our known interests must be safeguarded.” From Viceroy, Vdth September 1906.Register No. Minute Paper. SECRET DEPARTMENT.

U*7*QG*— ll*No. 97 or 1906. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. To Thb Right Hon’ble JOHN MORLEY, O.M., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. v Sir, t Simla, the 12th July 1906. * In His Excellency the Viceroy’s telegram of 26th May, we expressed our willingness to contribute on certain conditions a sum of £50,000 towards a loan which it might be advisable, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, to make, on the decease of His Majesty the Shah of Persia, to His Imperial Highness the Wali Ahd, with a view to preventing anarchy in Persia. It will perhaps be convenient if we supplement the telegraphic summary of our views by a somewhat fuller exposition of our general attitude towards the question of granting loans to Persia from Indian revenues. 2 . We are fully alive to the danger of the spread of anarchy in Persia, which might enable interested foreign Powers to take measures menacing to the security at present enjoyed by India on her flank, and consequently entail a drain on our resources far in excess of the sums which we have already lent to the Persian Government. Nor do we deny that it is a matter of great importance to prevent Persia falling completely into the financial toils of a potential enemy such as Russia or Germany. We appreciate the gravity of these general considerations. But we think that any further advances to Persia from Indian revenues should be made conditional upon tangible and definite concessions, such as will tend to secure us against the dangers just indicated, and to strengthen our position in the south of Persia and the Gulf. 3. We may perhaps illustrate our meaning by a brief review of the recent history of loans to Persia. For some years before 1898 the finances of that country had been disorganised and constant deficits had compelled recourse to temporary advances from various sources. It was soon evident, however, that it was vain to seek financial aid save from Russia or Great Britain. In 1898 proposals were made for a loan of a million and a quarter sterling to be floated in London by the Imperial Bank. But the terms, which included a provision for direct control of the Customs, were considered by the Grand Vizier to be unduly onerous; the amount was declared to be insufficient; and the negotia tions collapsed. The endeavour to arrange a British loan having failed, His Majesty’s Government approached the Czar’s Ministers, with suggestions for joint action in providing the Persian Government with funds. The Russian Government professed to regard the idea with favour, and desultory discussions continued till late in 1899. In September of that year, Count Lamsdorff declared that no negotiations for a Russian loan had taken place, and that, should any be undertaken, they would be preceded by a frank exchange of views with His Majesty’s Government. The value of the assurance was soon to he shown. ti A tl/~c2 On the 30th January 1900, the Russian official gazette announced the conclusion of a Persian loan of 22,500,000 roubles at 5 per cent, the bonds to issue at 85. The amount was secured on the entire Customs of Persia, ^ save only those of “Pars and the Persian Gulf ,, . In case of default! /1 try provision was made for direct control. Persia was debarred from obtaining any fresh foreign loan until 1910, save with the previous consent of the Russian Government. A portion of the loan was to be utilised to pay off the entirety of the British debt of 1892 and of the various sums advanced by the Imperial Bank. Among the more tangible political considerations for the loan may be mentioned an understanding as to the construction of a line of telegraph from Meshed to the south of Khorasan. 4. The relief was only temporary. In the following year the Shah was again in need of funds, and the British Government were again approached. His Majesty’s Government were anxious to avert a further Russian loan. The money could not, however, be raised in the London market, nor could the Home Treasury provide the amount. Enquiry was therefore made whether Indian revenues could find a sum of £500,000. Lord Curzon’s Government at once replied that the Government of India not only could advance the capital, but considered the opportunity one of the greatest political importance. An adequate return must be obtained, however, and the terms suggested were as follows:— (1) the loan to be secured upon the Customs of the Gulf Ports and upon the revenues or Customs, preferably the former, of Seistan; (2) the contemplated changes in the Persian tariff then under discus sion with Russia to be submitted to, and receive the assent of, the Government of India; (3) the loan to be accompanied by a plain statement to the Persian Government that, in view of the British interests thus created, in addition to those already existing in Southern Persia and Seistan, His Majesty’s Government could not admit the creation of any rival interest in those regions. To avoid infringement of the recent Russian contract which forbade the raising of a foreign loan, it was proposed that the transaction should be concluded through the intermediary of the Imperial Bank. Eurther discussions followed. Finally, on the 6th November, His Majesty’s Minister was authorised to offer a loan of the amount named, subject to conditions based upon His Excellency’s recommendations. But modifications were introduced which diminished the direct political advantage; and Sir Arthur Hardinge was informed that the advance could not be made through the Imperial Bank. The Atabeg at once replied that some assurance would be required that his acceptance of the loan would not violate the contract with Russia, which forbade the raising of any external loan. The restriction as to payment through the Bank was subsequently withdrawn; but the negotiations fell through. 5. A further Russian loan was already being discussed. In September 1901 and in January and March 1902 sums aggregating 3,000,000 roubles were advanced by the Banque d’Escompte; and in April 1902, the announcement appeared of a further Russian loan of 10,000,000 roubles. The terms were similar to those of the transaction of 1900, save that the period of financial tutelage was extended from 1910 to 1912, and that the security for the loan included, not only the existing Customs revenues of Persia, but also those which might be derived from Customs posts established thereafter. The latter provision was clearly intended to include new posts on the land frontier between British and Persian Baluchistan. But substantial political advantages had also been gained. The Russian Government had secured the right of negotiating a new tariff most advantageous to Russian trade while penalising British imports, without the intervention of any third Power. A concession had been obtained for the construction of a road through Azerbaijan to Tehran. Finally, the term of the Russo-Persian Railway Agreement of 1S90 had been extended for a further period of ten years. The original document had provided that for a term of ten years the Persian Government would notitself construct, “ nor permit nor grant a concession for the construction of railways to a company or other persons The renewal Agreement signed on the 14th December 1899 included the significant provision “that for another ten years, excepting the Russian Government, no other Government will be given a concession to build railways in Persia ,f . Other concessions, however, for which M. Witte had made strenuous efforts, had not been granted; the offer of a Rritish loan had at least assisted the Persian Government: in placing some check upon the rapacity of Russian demands. 6 . The need for money was now chronic; within a few months a further loan was needed; the British Minister was again approached; and India was again invited to assist. The experience of the previous year had shown the difficulties which beset a simple loan. His Majesty’s Government suggested, therefore, that the transaction should take the form of a purchase from the Persian Government of the sole right to construct roads, railways, and other commercial undertakings in Seistan and South-East Persia and in the region between Mohammerah and Kermanshah. Eor the present, however, the Russo- Persian Railway Agreement barred the way ; and until such time, therefore, as we could exercise the right of constructing railways, it was proposed to provide that Persia should pay interest on the purchase money secured on the Customs of Southern Persia. lor so substantial a return, the Government of India were prepared to lend any sum up to a million pounds sterling. It was suggested, however, that the area of the monopoly to be of any value must extend across the entire width of Southern Persia, and not be confined to the extreme east and west. The Minister was instructed to endeavour to secure the grant of privileges of the kind indicated in return for a loan of half a million sterling. But Sir Arthur Hardinge was opposed to the demand of considerable conces sions, and eventually was authorised to make an advance without direct return of any kind. On the 4th April 1903, a sum of £200,000 was placed at the disposal of the Persian Government. The interest was to be 5 per cent; the security consisted of the Caspian Sea Fishery dues, the Post and Telegraph reve nues, and the Customs of Pars and the Persian Gulf. The loan was repayable in twenty years. But the annual instalments were not fixed, nor was it definitely agreed that the sum should not be repaid in a shorter period. The transaction was effected through the Imperial Bank. Something had been gained. It had been shown that Persia was not yet in complete financial bondage to the Russian Government; and to enhance the value of the proof, the Grand Vizier refused to consider a proposal which the Russian Minister hastened to make of a further Russian loan to discharge the British debt. Hardly had this sum been advanced, when the Grand Vizier expressed his desire for further assistance; and after lengthy discussions, an additional sum of £100,000 was paid to the Persian Government on the 1st September 1904. It was definitely stipulated that this advance should form a part of that made in the previous year, and that the wffiole should be repaid, capital and interest, in twenty equal annual instalments. The total sum of £300,000 was advanced by the Government of India, but the British Government accepted a liability for one-half of any eventual loss. 7. From this retrospect it will be seen that the Russian Government have consistently used their loans to secure definite political and commercial objects which have given them a very strong hold upon the Government of the Shah. The Government of India have also striven to obtain some such consideration for their advances, but hitherto the results have been rather negative, though the advances themselves have perhaps been of use in that they have prevented the Shah from falling hopelessly under the financial domi nation of Russia and have also limited to some extent the demands which the Russian Government might have made upon Persia for further concessions. 8 . The same policy was followed again when in 1904 and 1905 negotia tions w T ere taking place with the Persian Government for the completion, also on the basis of a joint British guarantee, of the loan of £500,000, of which the loan of £200,000 effected in 1903 was to have been the first instalment, the Government of India laid stress on such a loan being conditional on the grant4 of a concession of much political value in Arabistan, namely, the gift of\ preferential rights to Great Britain in connection with the carrying out of irrigation projects on the Karun River. On 16th May 1905, your predecessor was informed that the Government of India were opposed to any ^ further advance being made from Indian revenues without political conditions: and later in the same year the assent of the Government of India to a further loan of £150,000 out of Indian funds, subject to the usual joint British guarantee, was conditional on the specific inclusion in the revenues pledged to us of the Arabistan Customs and the promise that all railway construction in Southern Persia, including Seistan, should, as far as foreign assistance was concerned, be carried out under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government. When this proposal collapsed owing, apparently.^ to the ^ desire of the Persian Govern- A ment for a larger loan (though it is not quite clear from the correspondence »H communicated to us whether this was the only reason) and our views were invited in December 1905 on a fresh proposal of the Persian Government for a ^ I $ British loan of £800,000, we expressed our inability to produce this sum out of Indian funds, even with a joint British guarantee, unless further sub- ^ stantial political and commercial concessions were granted in exchange; and / ^ ) on gth January last, we gave a list of concessions which we considered should u he obtained and which, we still hold, even now that the negotiations have been V ' ■ broken oif by His Majesty’s Government, would be of intrinsic value, both \v&lt; ^ commercially and strategically and as a means of preventing the spread of VH anti-British influences in Southern Persia. 9. To turn to another aspect of the question, namely, the relative respon- A r sibility of the Home and Indian Exchequers for the maintenance of British interests in Persia, we recognise that, for the purpose of avoiding undue P publicity, the practice of obtaining funds for these loans out of Indian revenues is convenient: it is an expedient, however, which should, in our opinion, only be resorted to in cases of urgent necessity : and we respectfully submit that, should a loan to Persia be considered desirable in the future for the protection of imperial interests without definite consideration or out of regard to the political situation in Europe, it will be rather for His Majesty’s Govern ment to advance the money than for the Government of India, who only have the comparatively small financial resources of India on which to draw. In formulating our views we have assumed that His Majesty’s Government are prepared to hold themselves responsible for half the amount of any advances of either kind that may he made, but even so we feel bound to indicate our extreme reluctance to invest more Indian capital in trying to prop up a bankrupt Government without definite and tangible consideration. The value of such consideration would, of course, depend upon the readiness of His Majesty’s Government to utilise and enforce, in case of necessity, the con cessions which constitute it, 10. We do not propose in this despatch to discuss the question of British general policy in Persia. If circumstances have rendered it desirable to alter that policy or to formulate a detailed plan of action in the event of certain j contingencies, we trust that we may he informed at an early date, as it ^ i ^ obvious that our ^willingness to lend in any circumstances to the Persian Government musrAdepend upon the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards that countryv^m which' the interests and even the safety of India are so closely involved. 11. In offering these remarks we have no desire to hamper His Majesty s Government in any negotiations which may be pending or in progress with a view to the conclusion of an understanding with Russia on the subjects on which there has hitherto been a conflict of interest. Although in the Viceroy s telegram of the 13th February 1906 we expressed some doubt as to the confidence which should be reposed in Russian assurances in relation o Persia, we fully recognise that His Majesty’s Government are alone in a posi tion to estimate how far these doubts are justified in the present position o European politics, and we should welcome any definite agreement with ^1111^ ^ 1&amp;A /v) /fa h/- c ‘ A which recognised and effectively protected our special interests in Persia, think it our duty, however, once more to call attention to the possibility ^ concerted action with Russia may, unless adequate safeguards are obtame »be attended with results inimical to the maintenance of our predominant influence in those parts of Persia with which India is primarily concerned and which it is essential, in our opinion, that we should maintain.

From Viceroy, Qth January 1906. {Repeated to Grant Duff). Foreign Secret. My telegram of 22nd December. Following are concessions recommended if it should he decided to grant loan; — {a) Con cession for road, Bunder Abbas to Bam, via Began, with exclusive right of running motors or vehicles propelled by mechanical traction. Recent investigation by competent officer shows practicability of road convertible into railway if and when required, {b) Undertaking that construction of roads, railways, canals, or telegraphs in Southern Persia be carried out, in so far as foreign assistance required, under auspices of British Government -; Southern Persia to include country south of line Khanikin to Birjand. (c) Bight to execute Karun irrigation project on lines indicated in our Despatch of November 1904. Investigation not complete, but available data point to remunerative project, {d) Telegraph Nasratabad to Robat. Of foregoing {a) and (b) are far most important. Commercial Mission’s recommendation and inefficacy of Lur road concession owing to tribal unrest supply grounds for request. It is obvious that such a road would preclude extension of Russian roads or railways to coast between Bunder Abbas or Gwettar. Scheme {c) less immediately concerns India; it falls within general scope of {b) and should not be pushed independently to prejudice of (a) or {b). Concession (d) should be secured in addition to all or any of above, if, indeed, it has not been already secured as counterpoise of Russian telegraph from Bajgiran. It might be arranged concurrently with loan negotiations, but without express stipulation in loan contract. Sykes, in telegram dated 29th December, reports Russian Minister is negotiating for Tehran Meshed road. This indicates that Russian activity in pushing her inlluence in Persia has in no way slackened. w--. .Lv 2 ' i’50. 3„ 7 s FOREIGN OFFICE, 24 May 1906.

IThis Docmneat is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Gov«m»»«nt) COUNT BENCKENDOB;EF read to me to-day some extracts from a message which Count Lamsdorff had desired him to communicate. This was to the effect that the Russian Government had noticed with much satisfaction how, without any anterior agreement, England had gradually shown a tendency to co-operate with Russia. He instanced our co-operation in Crete and in Macedonian reforms, where he had observed that, even when Lord Lansdowne had wished to make a proposal which was not entirely in accord with Russian views, it had been done in such a way as to make the Russian Government feel that co-operation with them was desired. He further instanced the Algeciras Conference as evidence of our working together. I said that I was very glad to receive such a message, and from some things in Count Lamsdorff’s message I gathered that the Russian Government might perhaps wish to go further and to have something in the nature of an entente, such as we had with France. Count Benckendorff seemed to think that, owing to the unsettled condition of affairs in Russia, it was somewhat difficult for the Russian Government to come to us with offers which might be used against them in Russia at the present time. I said that every arrangement of this kind must have two sides, and, of course, , what we should expect would bo that repose should be guaranteed on our Indian frontier. I thought we could guarantee that on our side there would be repose, in the sense of not pushing forward into Asia, but we should want to be sure that if we | maintained this attitude there would be no changes in the Russian frontier which 1 would operate to our disadvantage or disturb the prospects of peace. In Europe we had, as Count Lamsdorff had observed, found no difficulty in co-operation. In Asia it would perhaps be easier for us to arrange for co-operation now than it had been a few years ago. At any rate, I said, we had done our best to keep the door open for agreement, for we had lately been very much pressed to lend money to the Persian Government, which we had declined to do, because we could not lend it without making conditions which would alter the situation in Persia. Count Benckendorff was aware of this, but the only observation he made _ was that he did not think Russia would have much difficulty in securing the condition we desired on the Indian frontier, and he said nothing as to what requests Russia might have to make on her side with regard to that or any other question. He evidently regarded the matter as one for further consideration as to how far the good relations between Russia and ourselves, which are at present entirely indefinite, could take some more definite form. _ ., J1 J . depended upon whether Germany would give up the idea of having police of a third power at Casa Blanca, and if so what she would ask m return. If she gave up Casa Blanca but asked concessions which the French could not accept, it woulu, of course, not advance matters. But I saw some reason to hope that Germany really desired a settlement, and if so I hoped the Conference might end m an Agreement. AFFAIRS OF RUSSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [March 19.

Foreign Office, March 3, 1906. I AM. clii6ct6cl oy Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant relative to certain difficulties which have arisen in the financial relations of the Imperial Bank of Persia with the Persian Government, and to inform you that this letter, and your previous communication of the 11th January last have received the careful consideration of His Majesty’s Government. It would appear that the Persian Government, finding themselves unable to meet the promissory note to the Imperial Bank for an overdraft incurred in the course of last summer, have requested the bank to accept, in lieu of immediate repayment, drafts on the southern customs payable in instalments, that the bank desire to accommodate the Persian Government in the matter, but that they are reluctant to do so unless His Majesty’s Government will give them a specific assurance of support. Sir E. Grey notes your statement that the overdraft in question was made in reliance on the grant of pecuniary assistance to Persia by the Government of India through the intermediary of the Imperial Bank, but he cannot admit that the offer of a loan on certain conditions to the Persian Government, which they did not at the time show any disposition to entertain, can be held to render His Majesty’s Government in any way responsible for the action taken by the Imperial Bank in the matter. The question whether the Imperial Bank should accept the proposal now made by the Persian Government to extend the term for the repayment of the overdraft is not, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, one in which His Majesty’s Government can undertake the responsibility of offering advice. The Imperial Bank are themselves best able to judge the merits of the proposal, both from the point of view of finance and of expediency, and it is for them to decide the matter in accordance with what they conceive to be their truest interests. I am to add that, in the event of the Persian Government failing to fulfil their engagements to the Imperial Bank, your Directors may rely in the future, as in the past, on a full measure of diplomatic support from His Majesty’s Government through the British Legation at Tehran. But you will readily understand that it is impossible for His Majesty’s Government to incur any financial liability for such operations as the bank may feel called upon to undertake. I am, &amp;c.

'B __ _ » &gt; . ., THE Persian Minister asked to see me to-day, and told me that lie had come in { order that he might inform the Shah whether the British and Russian Governments had an understanding between each other. I said that we desired to be on friendly 5 terms with the Russian Government, and had made that known, and that they also desired to be on friendly terms with us. The Persian Minister continued to press me as to whether we had any definite understanding in the sense, for instance, that we had an * understanding with 1 ranee. I said we had not got any definite agreement with Russia about details, as we had with France. The Persian Minister then asked whether we had an intention of making any such agreement. I said that it was impossible to say anything about intentions. This sort of thing depended on circumstances. We had had difficulties with the French Government with regard to Egypt, Newfoundland, and other questions, and we had removed these by a definite agreement. Should we in the future have difficulties with the Russian Government, we no doubt might be desirous of removing these by agreement in the same way. But at the present moment I did not think we had any difficulty with the Russian Government which it was necessary to discuss in detail. He asked me what our views were with regard to Persia, and I said that we desired to see the integrity and independent sovereignty of Persia maintained. He then pressed me very much on the subject of the loan which the Persian Government desired, and asked me what we meant by saying that we could not lend money under present circumstances. I said that I thought the Persian Government had borrowed enough money already, and that we should not, by lending them more, be doing anything to promote the strength of Persia. The Persian Minister asked me whether we would not do at least what Lord Lansdowne had promised to do when he offered to lend 150,0007. or 200,0007. I replied that when I came into office I found that that offer of Lord Lansdowne had not been accepted by the Persian Government. They had put forward an entirely new demand for 800,0007., which we were not prepared to lend, nor were we prepared to renew the offer of the smaller loan, which had not been accepted, and had been put aside by the Persian Government. The Persian Minister then pressed me further as to whether we would lend money to Persia if the Persians would use it to pay off the Russian loan, but I said we could not entertain this proposal. He then asked me what advice I would give should the Persian Govern ment appeal to British capitalists for a loan, and should the British capitalists apply to the Foreign Office for advice. I said that we could not advise any British capitalist to lend money to Persia without guaranteeing the loan or in some way taking responsibility for it ourselves, and as we were not prepared ourselves to lend money to Persia I did not see how we could facilitate Persia’s borrowing it elsewhere. He urged that if we would not lend the money the Persian Government would have to apply to Russia, and pressed me for advice as to what they should do. I said that I was very sorry not to be able to give a favourable answer, or to give the particular assistance for which he asked, but that as I was not giving that assistance it was not possible for me to give advice with regard to the borrowing of money. t —[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government,!

Count Lamsdorff added that he was quite of the opinion that an end should be put to the practice under which the Persian Government was able to obtain money from the English or. the Russian Government by playing off one against the other. Besides which, the service rendered to Persia, by offering a loan, was much like that afforded by a moneylender to a spendthrift—which only made him reckless and plunged him deeper into embarrassment. He expressed his satisfaction at the frank nature of the communication, and asked me to inform you accordingly. I gathered from his language that he regarded the idea of a loan to Persia with disfavour, and did not press him as to the suggestion that, if the Russian Government thought a loan advisable, His Majesty’s Government was prepared to enter into negotiations on the subject.

SECRETARY OE STATE , TO VICEROY, FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. (Vafrorum)A J A Trom. Viceroy, VMh February 1906. / ^ r - Foreign Secret. Your telegram of 6th February. Persian Loan. I understand that your refusal to grant loan only refers to previous appli cation, and refusal of further request of Persian Government is contingent upon Russian Government also declining to make any advance. If this is correct, I desire to offer no remark beyond that it will he necessary to ensure that Russian Government, while keeping promise to the eye, does not allow loan to be made by Banque des Prets, on the ground that it cannot interfere with commercial operations of the Bank, or by any other indirect channel. I would justify our doubts of Russian procedure by reference to equivocal proceedings of that Government regarding proposals for joint loan, and their own previous loans, vide Lord George Hamilton’s telegram dated 1st February 1900, as regards first loan, and Lord Lansdowne’s Despatch No. 316, of the 3rd December 1901, to Sir C. Scott, written only one month before loan of 1902 was concluded. If Russia is unwilling to give categorical assurances on the point, I would even now suggest that question of granting loan should be reconsidered, if Persian Government accept condition that money lent should be expended under British control, which they are now apparently prepared to do, since despatches from Tehran and St. Petershurgh both indicate that Ritssia is prepared to grant loan, though on most stringent terms. I presume that His Majesty’s Government have considered possibility of general anarchy in Persia, consequent on want of funds, if loan is refused by both Powers, and of risk that this may involve us in measures for the restoration of order.CONFIDENTIAL •gflYgoX ^21 FEB 1906:-' &lt;o.\ v'v ' %L DEPf§&gt; X Edward Grey to Mr. Grant Duff (Tehran) (No. 33.)

I HAVE the honour to report that I arrived in St. Petersburgh yesterday. The town piesented its usual peaceful aspect, with indications of festive preparations for the celebration of Christmas Day to-morrow, large numbers of Christmas trees being in the streets for sale. ' ' 5 I at once called upon Count Lamsdorff, and handed to his Excellency an official request to be received in audience by the Emperor so as to present to His Majesty the letter from the King announcing my recall. It was tacitly agreed that any discussion of political questions should be postponed until another occasion, and I therefore called again on Count Lamsdorff to-day and had an hour’s friendly conversation with his Excellency. I told Count Lamsdorff that the day before t left London I had the pleasure of seeing Count Benckendorff, and that his Excellency had given me some notes in his own handwriting from which it appeared that the Russian Government had received information from their Minister in China to the effect that His Majesty’s Government were negotiating a Treaty with the Chinese Government relating to Thibet, which would be in contravention with the repeated assurances of Lord Lansdowne as to the intentions of His Majesty’s Government. The substance of the information givea by M. Pokhotiloff proved, however, to be purely imaginary and to have no foundation whatever, and it was evident that he had been made the victim of a deception. I gave Count Lamsdorff a short account of what had taken place and of how the negotiations for the conclusion of a Treaty of Adhesion had failed, and I assured him that our situation in Thibet remained the same as at the conclusion of the Convention which had been ratified on the 11th November, 1904, and subsequently published. His Excellency thanked me for the information, and stated that the reports sent i by M. Pokhotiloff had appeared to him somewhat vague and improbable, but that he had thought it best to court a contradiction from His Majesty’s Government, since there was a certain party in Russia who regarded with jealous suspicion any modifica tion of the status quo in Thibet, where Russian interests were, however, of a purely religious nature. He expressed his satisfaction that this report has been thus disposed of. I remarked to Count Lamsdorff that there appeared to me to be some strange agency at work endeavouring to create a sense of distrust between the two Govern ments, for, while these baseless reports were being transmitted from China, still more absurd stories had been recently repeated from Constantinople of an extension of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance to the Near East with a view to modifying the international situation in the Straits of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus. Such stories were really too grotesque to require serious contradiction, and it was only from the RwssWk &gt;- Government that such an, incredible suggestion had been heard. It was, however, fa 1 better in these cases to frankly ask for information from His Majesty’s Governmeu and so to prevent the possibility of distrust being created by the intrigues of a thii party, and I expressed the hope that Count Benckendorff would invariably in sue cases address himself to you or to me when I have taken up my duties at the Foreig r Office, and thus prevent the possibility of any misunderstandings. Count Lamsdorff replied that he had been completely mystified by this tion, which he had received in circumstantial detail from more than one sr that he had warned the Russian Ambassador at Constantinople to u mystery and to endeavour to ascertain the object and the origin of tl intrigue. He entirely agreed as to the expediency of a frank interchange of between the two Governments as the best means of frustrating the m; those who wished to create mischief, and he expressed his confidence the manner the unity of aim of the two countries would gradually become all parties, and that those differences which had existed in the past woi disappear. [2324 u —18]To this remark I replied that I had been very much struck during my recent absence in England by the change in public opinion towards Russia and by the warm sympathy generally felt towards her during the serious crisis through which she had been passing. I had been particularly impressed at healing piayeis offered up in a small country church a few 'weeks ago for the restoration of peace and trancpiillity in. Russia, and I regarded such an incident as an indication of the feeling of all classes. I felt that after your conversation with Count Benckendorff on the 13th ultimo it was hardly necessary for me to repeat that His IVlajesty s Government would resume with pleasure at a suitable moment the negotiations for a, genera] understanding on all ouestions which had unfortunately been interrupted by the outbreak of the war, and, as a proof of the bona fides of the intentions of His Majesty’s Government, I reminded his Excellency of your statement of your desire to avoid any action whicli might he interpreted as taking advantage of the embarrassments of the Russian Government or which might prejudice the success of the negotiations later. I remarked, however, that when you had talked to me on this subject before I left London you had distinctly stated that you expected an attitude of reciprocity on the part of the Russian Government, and that no attempt would in the meantime be made by them to modify the status quo in Persia or elsewhere. I said that Persia had been particularly mentioned since it was known to His Majesty s Government that the Persian Government had made an application some time ago to the Russian Govern ment for a loan of money, and that the loan had not been accepted owing to the onerous nature of the conditions imposed. The Persian Government had thereupon applied to His Majesty’s Government, and I knew that you were strongly opposed to granting the Persian Government any money at all, and that you had written to the Prime Minister in that sense. . . Count Lamsdorff replied that it was quite true that an application for a loan had been made some time ago by the Persian. Government, but that he was very averse to giving them any more money, as it was simply throwing money away. He fully anpreciated the value of your message to Count Benckendorff, and assured me that he gladly undertook to assume an attitude of reciprocity. He stated that there was no fv ir :t present of any policy of adventure being adopted in Persia or elsewhere. I observed that it was not so much the action of officials or the Ministry for foreign Affairs which was to be feared as that of persons such as M. Gruhe, who, though belonging to the Ministry of Einance, acted in Persia quite independently o the Russian Legation. _ . , Count Lamsdorff assured me that with the present Minister of Einance 1 nee feel no alarm on that score, and that it was not likely that anything would now be done in Persia without his being previously consulted. • -vr • f 5 I further mentioned that the only possible eventuality by which His Majesty s Government might unwillingly be forced to deviate from their present policy o inaction would he in the case of a fanatical outbreak in the South of Persia against he Christians, when it might become necessary to protect British subjects in e South, and more particularly in the ports of the Persian Gulf. Proofs oi e imminence of such an outbreak were not, however, conclusive. He said that such an outbreak would constitute a common danger, an no objection could be raised to the adoption of requisite precautions to crusi i .it once. _ _ . j i. t Count Lamsdorff finally expressed to me his great satisfaction at hearing w ia lad told him of the friendly sympathy manifested in England towards Russia, w ic ie interpreted as the result of a higher culture than that which prevails m country, and as a recognition of the necessity of a strong Russia as a counterpoise r iropean system. He regarded the improvement in the relations ot tie es as a most happy and welcome omen for the future. (Signed]^ 6 ’ &amp; CHARLES HARDINGE. iIAWarj'CONFIDENTIAL.

Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Mr. Davis to Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball. (Confidential.^ October 8, 1901. I HAVE the honour to report that, in accordance with your instructions, I proceeded with the party of Guides Cavalry to Shiraz and arrived there on the 3rd instant. After communicating with you, by telegraph, I arranged for the party to proceed on to Ispahan with the Legation courier, and they left Shiraz on the night of the 6th instant. 2. At Borasjoon I found Jalal-ul-Mulk, the new Governor of Kazeroon and Dashtistan, with a considerable following of sowars and sarbazes engaged in collecting revenue. I called on him, and he was very pleasant and civil, and sent orders to the Kalantars of Kazeroon and places between to give me all assistance. These orders were carried out, and I received every civility en route, the Kazeroon man sending out a number of sowars to meet us. Jalal-ul-Mulk told me he was having some trouble with the Tangistani Chiefs, Hyder Khan and Zayer Khadir, and that his men had been fired on, so he had dispatched some sarbazes and a gun fo coerce them, but so far without result. I heard that he has increased the demand for revenue on all the Dashti villages very greatly, and that he is trying to obtain 10,000 tomans more than usual from Borasjoon alone. Between Borasjoon and Daleki, I met the eldest son of the Eath-ul-Mulk of Shiraz, a young man of about 20, whom I had met last year in Shiraz. He told me that he was on his way to join the Jalal-ul-Mulk, and as he also had a following, the Dashti villagers are to be pitied. 3. With reference to my Confidential telegrams of the 4th and 5th instant, on the subject of the discourtesy of Shoa-es-Sultaneh, the Prince Governor of Shiraz, I have the honour to submit the following account of the incident:— When I arrived at Kazeroon on the 30th September, I telegraphed to the “ Nawab ” Mirza Hyder Ali Khan, British Agent at Shiraz, saying that I should [2504 c—-3] * Bmm 2 arrive at Shiraz on the morning of the 3rd, and that he should make the customary intimation to His iioyal Highness the Prince Governor. 1 reached Shiraz on the morning of the 3rd instant, and was met a few miles out by an official called Moyeen Humayoon, Earrash Bashi of the Prince, and at present acting as Beglar Begi. A servant of the Poreign Agent was also there, and said that his master intended to come, but was prevented by a headache. I drove into Shiraz with Moyeen Humayoon, hnd told him that, as I was only stopping till the evening of the 5th, I hoped that His Iboyal Highness would be good enough to give me an early opportunity of calling and presenting the President’s compliments. On arrival at Shiraz, I sent the Nawab to the Prince to arrange a time for my call, but he was not received, and no answer was given beyond messages from Moyeen Humayoon and another official, Muzaiin-ed-Dowleh, that it was each the business of the other to arrange the call. As the Nawab had.told me that the Prince had been very rude to him whenever he had been to him on business, and that he had always been made to stand in his presence, although the Mazir remained seated, I had instructed him to tell the officials that, if he accompanied me when visiting the Prince officially, I expected him to be given a chair. I did this, as it has been the invariable custom for the Nawab to be given a chair when calling officially as British Agent, both in the Zil-es-Sultan’s time and in that of the Birman Pinna, Bmkun-ed-Dowleh, and all other Governors of Shiraz. Up till the evening of the 4th, I had received no intimation of any kind from the Prince, and the Nawab informed me that, although he had sent several times to the Palace, he could get nothing arranged, and Moyeen Humayoon had been rude to his men. I therefore wrote the letter, copy of which I inclose (Inclosure No. 3), and sent it to the Prince on the morning of the 5th. In reply I received at lO'SO a.m. the letter which I submit in original (Inclosure No. 3), and as I could not get to the Palace by 11 a.m., I wrote the letter (Inclosure No. 3). This letter was returned to me with a note written on the back in Persian by the Prince— tc I am present three hours before sun-down.” I took the Nawab and a few men of the Guides and drove to the Palace at 3 p.m. On arrival at the gate, there was no one to receive me, and the few farashes standing there said, in a very off-hand manner, that they had no orders to receive any one and that the Prince was in the Anaaroon (private apartments). The Nawab advised me to return, and I was inclined to do so at first; but, as I was anxious to avoid any unpleasantness if possible, I sent a message in to the Prince that I had come, and I told the son of Moyeen Humayoon, who had appeared, that if I received a reply in five minutes, I would remain; otherwise I should go away. ^ ^ In a little over five minutes, I received a message by a “ Peshkhidmat ” that the 1 rince would receive me shortly, and I took the opportunity of telling him that, if the IN awab was received with me, I expected him to be given a chair, otherwise I would not^go in. The Peshkhidmat went back and returned at once and said Bismilla. By this, both the Nawab and I understood that a chair would be given to him, so we went into the audience room. The Prince was alone, and said C£ Bon jour,” and motioned me to a seat; he, however, took no notice whatever of the Nawab’s bow r , and made no sign of offering him a chair. I then said that I had brought the British Agent with me; and, as he uas the Bepresentative of the British Government in Shiraz, it was the custom for him to be allowed to sit when calling officially, and 1 inquired if the Prince would allo^v him to sit down. The Prince replied, in the most offensive way, “ llasm nist ( ^ it is not the custom ’), and, as the Nawab had made a step towards me, shouted to him Beist (“stand up”). As I felt sure from the Prince’s manner that to stay longer would only be exposing myself to further rudeness, I rose, bowed to him, and left the room. I think there can be little doubt from the above facts that the Prince all along meant to be thoroughly discourteous, and I would add. that, although it is the custom to send some official soon after the arrival of a guest or official of a foreign Govern ment to inquire how he has stood the journey (“ Awal pursi no one was sent to me. the second reply of the Prince can only be taken as discourteous, and the omission to send any answer for two days, the absence of any kind of official to receive me at the. i alace, apart from the rudeness of the Prince himself, could only mean in this country that the caller was unwelcome, and a slight was deliberately intended towards him. Late that evening, the Nawab came to me to say that the Prince hadsent an intemperate telegram to Tehran, demanding that the Nawab must be removed w'Zrnf WOuld T send hl , m Tehran with his hands tied behind Ins back. Early MuzaiZed Em,Tb f° r Bushire ’ the Nawab sent to inform me tha t lenvinff tbe P^ 1 h l! iad + ! )eeD blm ’ and accused of being the cause of my did not ft n Palac e abruptly and being discourteous to the Prince, and said that, if he iZ ZZl 5 '™ 1 an n a i I,0 0 F’., t j e Prlnce would send sold iers to his house to insult ,inth 1 Z tF,i d Z 3 hl !- lan(led , property. The Nawab replied that he had had f ! d with my action and that whatever was done was the Result of the carj it hTSfrel Muzaiill - ed - I)on ’ leh left, saying that the Prince would 1 told the Nawab that I had telegraphed the facts to the Resident for the infer- mation of his Excellency the Minister, and that I hoped nothing further would nappcii, but that, it he was called on for any explanation, he was to say that he only ™ ^ 0i ; de : S f that 1 was responsible to the Resident and his Excellency the Minister for what had happened. I considered that [ could do no good by staying m u wf 2 ’ ar! ^ , i ^ ie ^ &gt;iance present state of mind, my presence might very probably result m further unpleasantness. 5 ^ As the Nawab has landed property round Shiraz, he is yery much at the Prince’s mercy, who can rum him if he is not supported by us, so that I trust that you will see your way to commending him to his Excellency the Minister’s care. I may mention that the only remark the Nawab made before the Prince was m reply to a question whether the Sahib spoke Erench or Persian, and he said “the feahib speaks Persian.” . ,, 1 can ° nl y suggest two reasons for the Prince’s behaviour. Eirst, that the arrival m the country of the party of Guides sowars was distasteful to the Persian Govern ment, and that orders had been sent to him to treat me as he did. Secondly and I think this is more probable—the opinion held by Persians of position who one and all have been subjected to harsh treatment at his hands as to the reason of the Prince’s demeanour towards them, namely that he is very young (he looks about 21 or 22), and that he is simply intoxicated with his position as Governor of the important province of Ears and the extensive authority which that entails. You aie auare that the Prince, since he has been in Shiraz, has been responsible or a large number of severe punishments, and, combined with his other measures for raising money, has created a strong feeling against himself. A few days before I reached Shiraz, a large placard was found affixed to the chief Mosque abusing and threatening him and heaping the foulest abuse on his Wazir. Erom the Europeans I heard that his conduct towards them had been of the rudest nature. To give two instances : on the occasion of the Shah’s birthday, the Prince invited them all to see some fireworks at the Palace ; a certain number went and were received by the Wazir, who was sitting on a chair; however, no other chairs were there, and they all had to stand during the performance. The other instance was on the occasion of two visits made by the Superintendent of Telegraphs to the Prince on telegraph business, when he was made to stand the whole time, although the Wazir was sitting. The next time he was summoned to the Palace he refused to go unless he was given a chair, and this had a satisfactory result. It is ot course very difficult for the Europeans to make any protest against uncivil treatment, as their business relations and, in fact, their personal safety depend so much on the good-will of the Governor-General: but they were all very bitter and contrasted him most unfavourably with former Prince Governors. I much regret this unpleasant incident, but hope that, under the circumstances, my action may be approved by you. 4. Another matter which I would bring to your notice, and which is the cause of some anxiety among the European community, is the shortly expected visit of the Bishop to baptise a convert of the Rev. Mr, Rice. I saw a good deal of Mr. Rice last year, and formed the opinion that he was judicious and careful not to stir up any excitement. He was on visiting terms with several of the leading Mullahs, and the son of the Imam Jumah gave him the use of bis garden in the country for a small rent when he and his wife required a change of air. He was then, however, not doing much more than teaching some boys English, and it is difficult to say what the effect of a baptism by the Bishop may have. If Saiyid Ali Akbar, who died the other day, were alive, there would undoubtedly be a disturbance, but at present the Mullah influence is much suppressed by the Prince, and if he allows the baptism to take place, it is possible that there will be no trouble. I think, however, that as he was [2504 c—3] B 24 ^ ntensGly rude to IVtr.

Our proposals for concerted action in regard omatter of the Persian loan had created a good impression, and there was every inclination to £C faire bon menage ” with us. A great deal of attention had also been paid to articles in the press and magazines here pointing to a better disposition on our part towards Russia. I told his Excellency that it was most satisfactory to me to hear that this was the case. With regard, however, to the Persian loan, I told his Excellency that I had heard on good authority that the Representative of the Russian Government at Tehran had maintained to the Persian Government that they were not at liberty to borrow from us or from any one else but Russia, and that the proposal for a loan obtained through the good offices of His Majesty’s Government was therefore likely to fall through. His Excellency said that he had no knowledge of any such occurrence; his own belief was that the Persian Government was free to borrow where it pleased, and that nothing had yet been done with regard to the Russo-Persian loan. M. de Staal then referred in a somewhat vague manner to the Anglo-Russian understanding of 1834—renewed in 1888—as to the integrity of Persia, which Ids Excellency regarded as still in force.

W ITH reference to Mr. Grant Duff’s telegram No. 164 of the 1st instant, on the subject of the financial condition of Persia, I have the honour to state that I had some conversation to-day with the Persian Minister here on this matter. He acknowledged that the Pei sian Government was in a situation of some embarrassment with regard to its finances^ but he told me that he had recently received a telegram from the Grand izier, stating that an immediate loan was not required, as the proposed reorganization o the aimy and Administiation would not be carried out at once. He assured me that no negotiations were being carried on through him, and that he did not believe the Russian Government had much confidence in M. Speyer, the Russian Minister in Tehran, who had recently been summoned to St, Petersburgh. With regard to the general question of an advance of money to meet the requirements of the Persian Government, he stated that M. \lassow, the late Russian Minister at Tehran, had urged the Persian Government to accept a Russian Controller in return for a loan, and that the Grand vizier had refused to accept such a condition. M. Mlassow had insisted that Turkey, which was a great Power, had accepted a similar condition in the form of the Inter national Commissioners of the Debt, and that her independence had not suffered. The Persian Government, however, had steadily objected, on the ground that the appoint ment of a, sole Russian Controller would lead to the loss of independence. While accepting the justice of this view, the Persian Minister observed that a loan without some form of control would only lead to the ruin of Persia, as the money would be spent on subsidies to favourites without any advantage to the State. He hoped some day to see his country have recourse to Europe in general, and not to Russia or England, foi financial aid, especially for the construction of railways j and he complained bitterlv of the jealousy between the tw r o countries, which made it, he said, impossible for his country to develop its resources as other countries had done, by improving the means of communication. AVith regard to the relations between England and Russia, while expressing the hope that they would improve, as such an improvement would be of the greatest service to Persia, he did not, he said, believe that Russia would ever consent to sign a Treaty with England with regard to Persia, such as had been agreed on by England and France with regard to Siam. Long years were, he thought, necessary before the views of Russia would change to that extent. At the present moment it would be a mistake to suppose that the interest of Russia in Persia had slackened. The failure of Russia’s attempt to obtain an access to warm water in the Far East could only result in increasing her desire to obtain command of a port in the South. On the other hand, the state of internal politics, the recent lesson in Manchuria, and, above all, the Anglo- Japanese Treaty would act as formidable deterrents. On the whole, he thought that Russia would remain quiescent as regards Persia for some time to come, and he hoped that this period would be utilized by Persia in reforming herself, and by Russia and England in arriving at a friendly understanding. Count LamsdorfF had, he said, expressed himself in a similar sense on a recent occasion. The Minister quoted the words used by his Excellency, which were: “We want to remain quiet in Persia, and will do so, as long as you make no betises.” It is, of course, possible that overtures are now being made here with a view to a Russian loan to Persia on condition of the acceptance of Russian financial control; but, if so, the language of the Persian Minister is hard to reconcile with such a fact, as he spoke in strong language as to the difficulty which a foreign Controller, acting- alone, would have in facing the instinct of independence ingrained in the Persian people.

Sn' C. Scott to the Marquess of Salisbury.—[Received February 12.) (No. 33.) My Lord, ,S2. Petersburgh, January 30, 1900. I CALLED on Count Mouravieff tc-day and, referring to the announcement in the “ Official Gazette” of the conclusion of a Russian loan to Persia, said that 1 could not conceal from him my astonishment at receiving the first intimation of the comple tion of this transaction from the public press. I read to his Excellency the reports of the conversations which Mr. Hardinge and I had had with Count Lamsdorff on the subject of financial assistance to the Persian Government, as recorded in my despatch No. 290 of the 21st September and Mr. Hardin gels No. 295 of the 29th September, 1899, and I said that your Lordship would have certainly been justified in expecting from the Russian Government some communication of their views of the lines which I had been authorized to suggest to Count Lamsdorff for joint financial assistance by Great Britain and Russia to Persia, before concluding a Russian loan debarring all participation on our part. I called Count Mouravieff’s attention to Count LamsdorfPs statement that, in his opinion, the decision of the Russian Government on the proposals for a, loan to Persia should be preceded by a frank exchange of views and an agreement with Her Majesty’s Government, that M. de Witte’s opinion on the lines which I had suggested for a joint loan would be asked, and communicated to me, and I also reminded his Excellency that only a fortnight ago he had himself informed me, in reply to my inquiry, that the loan proposals were still being studied by M. de 'Witte, and that the Imperial Government had not yet committed themselves to any engagement with the Persian Government on the subject of a loan. I asked him what would have been his own feelings if, after these conversations with Count Lamsdorff, he had read in the “London Gazette” that Her Majesty’s Government had sanctioned a loan from a British bank to the Persian Government debarring the latter, during its currency, from incurring any financial obligations to Russia without the consent of the British bank. I thought that, in this case, his Excellency would have been justified in regarding himself as treated with somewhat scant consideration. Count Mouravieff’s explanation w r as not very clear, and from his manner I gathered that he was not altogether unprepared for my remarks. He said that the matter being essentially a financial one had been left entirely in the hands of M. de Witte, and he was himself but imperfectly acquainted with the details of the arrangement which the “ Banque de Frets” had been finally authorized to conclude with the Shah’s financial representative. The Russian Foreign Office had, he said, only been concerned in impressing on M. de Witte that, in consequence of the objections entertained by Her Majesty’s Government, the customs revenue of the Persian Gulf ports should not be pledged as security for a Russian loan, and I would observe that the revenues from the Gulf ports and from the province of Ears had been carefully excluded in the case of this loan. I said that I understood that the Persian Government could not, in consequence of a previous engagement to Her Majesty's Government, have pledged these revenues as security for a foreign loan even if M. de 'Witte had desired it, and I reminded him that in my conversation with Count Lamsdorff I had also expressed an opinion that in-case of a joint loan from British and Russian Banks the security might be taken for the Russian share on the northern customs, where the trade was almost ex clusively Russian, and for the British share on the customs of the southern ports, where the trade was exclusively British, but that it would be desirable to exclude from the security of either loan the customs revenue of Kermanshah, where the trade was more international, in order to avoid any appearance of interference with the trade of other countries. [1789 m—-X] BCount Mouravieff seemed to take the view that it had not been customary of late to consult the interests of other Governments before concluding arrangements of this' kind, and he alluded with some significance to the railway concession recently obtained in Turkey by the German Government without consulting the interests of llussia, and to the British Loan for the construction of the railway at Manchuria. I said that as regarded the German Railway Concession we had also not been consulted, and I thought its grant had been as unexpected by us, as by his Excellency, but that I did not think we had any reason to view with any disfavour the grant to a German private undertaking of a concession to construct a Turkish Railway which would open up a new valuable trade route in the East, and gave no territorial rights or influence to any Foreign Government. I said that as regarded Persia, Great Britain and Russia, whose possessions were limitrophe with Persia under old Treaty engagements, took a special interest in the maintenance of the integrity and independence ot that country, and I ventured to remind him of the conversations which had taken place in 1889 between Sir Robert Morier and M. de Giers, which had been conducted on the only basis possible for such a discussion, namely on a footing of complete equality and mutual regard for the interests of the other, and especially when it was a question of aiding and en couraging the Persian Government to build up and maintain its integrity from within with the friendly co-operation of her great civilized neighbours, and that it was in this spirit that I had understood Count Lamsdorfi’s promise to take into consideration the suggestions which I had made to him about the loan. Count Mouravieff said that it would, certainly be very advantageous if this theory could be carried out in practice, but he must admit that in Ms experience of several recent questions with England, as, for instance, the one about tne lease of Raskam, which was now a thing of the past, he had found some difficulty in understanding how far our interests concerned were purely commercial and financial and not in some sense political ones. I confessed my inability to understand his Excellency being in any difficulty in this respect, as our explanations had always been singularly clear and frank and as I understood them quite satisfactory. Count Mouravieif repeated that in the present instance of the Persian loan, it had been treated purely on its financial merits. I must have been aware that for more than a year the Persian Government had been seeking this loan, and there had been a question of negotiating it in Prance. M. de Witte had been originally very luke-warm on the subject of a loan by Russia, owing to the state of the money market, but the present conjuncture was more favourable, and he had sanctioned it. The Persian Government, he said, objected to British participation in the Loan, and it had been concluded without it. I said that my information certainly did not bear out tlie assertion that the Persian Government were unwilling to conclude a loan wdth a British Bank, and I feared that his Excellency had been misinformed. I begged him, however, to understand that the observations which I had made to him referred solely to the manner in which the loan had been concluded, and were made entirely on my own authority. I had been induced to explain my feelings to him very frankly as I had been ttm 'channel of conveying to your Lordship, on the authority of what Count Lamsdorft had said to me, expectations which had not been realized. I had, I added, lost no time in telegraphing the substance of the official notice ol the loan to your Lordship, and I Avould reserve any official expression of views on the subject until I knew whether your Lordship had any observations to make on the subject of our conversation. Count Mouravieff said that he would be prepared to attend and reply to any official observations which I might then have to make to him on this matter. I have, &amp;c. ^ (Signed) CHARLES S. SCOTT.V' Sir C. Scott to the Marquess of Salisbury.—[Received February 12.) ' (No. 39. Confidential.) My Lord, Petersburgh, February 6 , 1900. WITH reference to my despatch No. 33 of the 30th ultimo, I have the honour to report that I have been unable to obtain any further details of the contract for the Hussian Loan to Persia than have been given in the official Notice published in the St. Petersburgh press, and forwarded as an inclosure in my despatch No. 34 of the 31st ultimo. It understood here that the final settlement was signed at Tehran, and it is evident that information respecting any unpublished terms of the agreement will be procurable from official sources here. Count Mouravieff has answered all inquiries put to him by my colleagues in the same sense—that the conclusion of the loan was a purely financial and non-political matter, which had been left in M. Witte’s hands, and that he was himself only imper fectly acquainted with the details. In financial circles here the impression appears to be that no part of this loan will be placed on the money market, which at the present moment would take very little interest in it. Although the market at St. Petersburgh is now firmer than it was, there is no disposition to buy new paper. It is believed that the whole of the 22,500,000 roubles, or as much of it as exceeds the settlement of the existing debtor and creditor account of the Shah’s Government with the Banque des Prets, will be furnished by the Bussian State Bank, of which the Banque des Prets in Persia is practically a branch, and that the advantages looked for in return for this loan by Russia in her present financial condition must be political, and not financial. The Russian public undoubtedly takes this view ; it considers the terms on which the loan has been negotiated as indicating a fresh brilliant achievement of Prussian diplomacy, and as constituting a valuable compensation for any loss it may have suffered by the grant to Germany of the important Railway Concession in Mesopo tamia. The public impression seems to be that by the terms of this loan Russia obliges Persia to free herself from all her financial obligations to Great Britain and their consequences, and by debarring her from contracting any foreign obligations during the currency of the new loan, without Russian consent, forces her to look solely to Russia for assistance and support in the future. It is considered, further, in military circles, that the demonstration recently made of Russian military strength on the southern frontier of her possessions in Central Asia, and her readiness at any moment to act with striking effect in case of any sudden emergency in Persia or Afghanistan, cannot fail to create its impression in Persia, -which is thus at the military as wmll as the financial mercy of Russia, and that, having thus barred the door and made matters safe in Persia, Russia can abstain from any further action at present, and quietly await the natural development of events. These advantages are held to be a sufficient compensation for any risk which Russia may have undertaken in the matter of the loan and its guarantee. I am unable here to form an opinion as to the importance of this loan and of its consequences to British interests in Persia, but what has most concerned me is the conviction which I have derived, from the mode in which it has been negotiated, that no confidence can be felt in any desire of the Russian Government to co-operate on equal terms with Her Majesty’s Government in any question affecting Persia. It would almost appear that, in view of our unfortunate entanglement in South Africa, the Russian Government thinks that it can leave out of account any considera tion of a possible conflict of her interests wdth those of Great Britain in Persia or in that part of the world, and that reliance on mere verbal assurances to the contrary has received a very severe shock.

My Lord SC Petersburgh, February 7, 1900. X HAVE already drawn attention in my previous Reports to the persistency with which rumours of increasing concentration of Russian troops in Central Asia, in pre paration of some important military movements on the Aiglian frontier, are being circulated by the military party in this country. I have also ventured to express a personal opinion that the chief object in circu lating these rumours, and magnifying the movement, which is undoubtedly still going on, of troops into Central Asia, is to create an impression ^ in England, which it is hoped will force us to bring the hostilities in South Africa to a premature con clusion. At the same time, X would seriously desire to guard myself against any idea of treating these rumours lightly. The military party in Russia is extremely powerful, and, strange as it may appear, X believe that since the Crimean war it has never been so violently hostile to England as it is at the present moment, and that nothing would be more popular in that part at least of the Russian army which is stationed in Trans-Caspia and the Caucasus than a decision of the Emperor to take advantage of our present entanglements to make some advance southwards either into Afghan or Persian territory. I have been myself careful since my conversation with the Emperor to abstain from any remark in conversation with Count Mouravieff which wonld betray a doubt of the pacific intentions of His Majesty or of his Ministers; but several of my colleagues, who have been much impressed by the persistency and seeming circum- stantialitv of the alarming rumours which have reached them, have questioned his Excellency and the Minister of War on the subject. My German colleague, who had gathered, from what lie regarded as a well- informed source, a confirmation of a report that the Governors of Turkestan and of the Caucasus, who have arrived recently at St. Petersburgh, had succeeded in over coming the scruples of the Ministers of War and Einance and of Count Mouravieff, and were now hopeful of inducing the Emperor to sanction an advance on Herat in the spring, questioned General Kouropatldne as to its correctness. His Excellency, Prince Racloiin informs me, assured him in the most positive manner that there was no ground whatever for this rumour, that the object of the con centration of troops at JCushk and in Central Asia was to make that position as strong as possible for defensive and offensive action if necessary in case of an emergency, but that Russia was neither disposed nor financially warranted to embark on a long and hazardous military adventure. General Kouropatkine also denied that there was any intention on the part ^ or the Russian Government to seek permission to extend its railway lines into Persian territory. Si . ; v' Prince Radolin appears to have asked Count Mouravieff yesterday what trutn there was in a report which had reached him that General Hukhowski, the Governor- General of Turkestan, had positively stated that an important military movement into Afghanistan or Persia would be made in the spring. -if Count Mouravieff gave a most categorical denial of this report, and said that all rumours of any aggressive or warlike designs on the part of Russia were absolutely false. , - I may add that Count Mouravieff, alluding to some violent Anglophobe articles in the Russian press, which X showed him yesterday, told me that he had himself just received an anonymous letter from Moscow threatening to have him shot with a Dum-Dum bullet if he continued to resist the popular wish for offensive action agams England. i i / My Austrian colleague, who had also heard these alarming rumours, but mis refrained from putting any question in regard to them to Count Mourayiefi, as he is inclined to share my view that they are circulated with an obvious object, told me yesterday there v/as one report which had just reached him that he thought it necessaiy to repeat to me in confidence. He knew for a positive fact that the Russian General named Bogdanovitcii, an. officer who was not held in any very serious estimation, was stating everywhere alle i’tlf r - e ^ faS . ted in the e “ :11 P an y, °f General Dukhowski the day before yesterday Qid that he Tad' aaonn H 16 G ?'-emor-General had expressly At ghan frontier, within a month he would 60,000 and 70,000, et alors je feral la h,aid that he had 30,000 men now on the have 45,000, and in* the spring between guerre.” Ilis Excellency on being asked whether it were true that the Ameer of Afghanistan was d vino* nn/i f n A + it ^ xu w^xc liu« tnab bue mmeer oi iugnamstan “the'OOh f U lles m er ?

The Indian Government is no doubt already aware of the fact, as pointed out to me by Colonel Beresford, that the change effected last year placing the military command in Turkestan on an independent footing has largely increased the offensive, as well as the defensive, capacity of that army, and that Russia has never yet been iii so favourable a position as she now is to act promptly and effectively in case she has designs on the territory of her southern neighbours. This fact, and the possibility of the rumours which I have mentioned having more foundation than Russian officials are prepared to admit, will no doubt not be lost sight of, and I presume that the Intelligence Department of the Indian Govern ment is fully prepared with plans to meet any danger to our Indian possessions that the military party in Russia may threaten us with. It seems strange that if these threats are seriously intended, they should be so openly advertised beforehand, hut I feel the grave responsibility which Her Majesty’s Embassy would incur if I omitted to call attention to them.

To this I added that we were ready to be parties to an arrangement concluded on the lines of your Lordship’s telegram No. 23 to Sir M. Durand of the 19th July, which I explained to him. Count Lamsdorff told me that he had already made the Persian Minister here aware of the fact that he could not begin negotiations about a loan until M. de Witte returned to St. Petersburgh, nor without arriving at an understanding with Her Majesty’s Government. M. de Witte’s return will not take place for three weeks at the earliest. His Excellency said that the loan had not been pressed for by the Russian Govern ment ; it had been offered to France in the first instance by the Persian Government. M. de Witte had shown no keenness in the matter of taking it up, looking upon it merely from the point of view of its financial merits, and had come to the conclusion that the only security Persia had to offer was the customs revenue, and that the revenue of the northern ports would barely cover the expenses of the service of the loan, as it was from the southern ports that the chief customs revenue was derived. Count Lamsdorff understood that the objections we entertained were based on the political circumstances connected with the question, and said he would cause an examination to be made of the alternative suggestion in order to ascertain if it was of a practicable nature. The general opinion was, he understood, that it was not advisable that Persia should be given a loan larger than absolute necessity required to free that country from the difficulties in which she was at present placed. 1 1DGGumciit is the Prop rtj -f II t nic Maj sty’ G ve 2 l i ' PERSIA AND APABIA CONEIDENTIAL.

The Ambassador expressed great satisfaction at this, and asked if he might inform his Government of what 1 had said, to which I readilv agreed. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) EDWARD GREY.

Q 110^° T£is Document is the property of the Secretary of State fo r India. Question of a Loan to Persia. Note by Sir Hugh Barnes. he history of our loan negotiations with Persia is one of lost opportunities, which almost mranably have been regretted. Whenever the question has reached the point of decision we have lacked the courage to advance large sums of money, though we have always regarded with anxiety and envy the increased power and influence in Persia, which have attended the bolder po icy o our Eussian rivals. We have now another opportunity of granting a considerable loan to Persia and of increasing thereby the value and efficiency of our stake in the country. It is, therefore, very desirable, before rejecting the chance offered, that the pros and cons should be very carefully weighed, lest we find once more that we have made a mistake, and this time one which may jirove irretrievable. As is stated in Lord Lansdowne’s Despatch of 6th January 1902, neither the British nor Indian Government has any designs upon the sovereignty o± the Shah or the independence of his State. There is not the smallest wish to use the concessions, which from time to time have been suggested as the political return for a loan, as a means to encroach upon the Shah’s territory or authority. Bor example, there is no desire to assume the control of the Southern Customs, or to make railways in Southern Persia, or to establish a Protectorate in Seistan. The main object of obtaining the concessions suggested has been to prevent the grant of them to another Power who would not be so scrupulous in making use of them, and who would certainly use them to our detriment. No doubt, as the Indian Government point out in their telegram of 28th December last, His Majesty’s Government, in the Despatch of January 1902, have laid down very distinctly the attitude that they would adopt if their interests in the Gulf or m Southern Persia were seriously compromised. They have, in fact, threatened to use force. But no one wishes to be compelled to put this threat into execution. Prevention is better than cure, aud it is wiser to forestall the grant to Eussia of political rights and advantages in Southern Persia, by monopolising them ourselves, than to allow matters to drift into a position from which we can only extricate ourselves at the risk of war. As regards the reasons for granting a loan to Persia, and the answers to them, which are mentioned in the Secretary of State’s telegram to the Viceroy, dated 22nd December, it may be pointed out— O'-) That the Southern Customs amount to 200,000/. a year, and are only a collateral security for the annual payment to us of 24,000/. per annum. There is, therefore, ample margin available as security for further loans, and there is nothing in the assurances given to us by Persia to prevent her from pledging the Southern Customs to another Power so long as she does not * See Sir A. Hardinge’s Report of July cede them,* or the control of them 1903 , page 10 . ciij.- ,, Such action on the part of Persia would be very embarrassing to us in view of Lord Lansdowne’s clear declaration of S. 37 . A jpolicy especially if the Foreign Power were Russia, who would certainly !ndeIvouv to turn the pledge into a cession. We should-have no alternative, unless we acquiesce, hut to threaten war. fii 1 -Vs already stated, there is no present desire on our part to use railway rights granted in Southern Persia. The object is to prevent these riehts bein«- granted to Russia, who certainly would use them, unless we •Xrvened. It is one thing to prevent the grant of a concession to another hv fii-t securing it ourselves, and quite another thing to force that other to l y h k g if is aranted. It may be added that there is surrender a concession atter it is granreu. j . v , • one railway line in Persia which it is anticipated would pay, viz., a hue from Z Gul( to Ispahan, and if such a line is ever constructed with formgn assistance it obviously should be made by a British Company. (Hi ) Bussia has never yet failed to find money for political purposes. She is in difficulties, hut she will not be in this condition for ever, or even for Ion- Her recuperative power is enormous, and the Grand Vizier stated in December that she is prepared to lend a million and a half on conditions. The purpose in this case,-to defeat, or to out-rival us,-is one that Russia is not likely to neglect, and the injury to us that may result is, that she may he offered concessions in which it is impossible for us to acquiesce If we irritate and embarrass Persia by refusing financial help, the risk of the grant to Russia of dangerous concessions is a serious one. (iv ) The trade argument is not of importance, except from the point o view that all our experience in Seistan and elsewhere shows that the grant , 0 f any political advantages to Russia is invariably made use of to embarrass and iinure our trade. _ ^ The present position is this. Persia is indebted to us only to the extent of qOO 000(. For the service of this loan the Persian Government have pledged the'revenues of the Caspian fisheries, and collaterally, in the oruer name , the Postal and Telegraph revenue and the revenues of the Customs ZZ Persian Gulf. Recently, if a further loan of 150,0001. is granted Persia has agreed (a) to accept our interpretation of the expression and the Persian Gulf,” and (6) to promise that all railway constracti Southern Persia, including Seisian, shall, so far as foreign assistance is required, he carried out under tl.e auspices of His Majesty s Gove ™ ’ We appear to be pledged to grant this loan, if Persia demands it and the concessions given are well worth the price. They include the Arabistau ports among the southern customs, and forestall Russia in the ma er of railway concessions in Southern Persia. I he loan is well secured, and from Mr. Grant Duffs telegram No. 164, dated 1st Decern er, seems probable that the Imperial Bank has already advanced money o^ the assumption that the loan has been arranged. D, however, ^ f ' the larger sum now asked for, Persia may reject the loan already pro , hTwhich case we lose the concessions obtained with so much trouble, and may also find ourselves in difficulties with the Bank. Assuming, however, that the smaller loan is given and a cce T‘ ed &gt; case the grant of the larger sum now asked for appears less ormi a • ^ The conditions agreed to will apply, of course, equa y , er The question that arises is whether, since a larger loan is as e ’ concessions should not be required. We know that even after pr vffimg for the service of the larger loan, there would st.ll he a smpl ’ P b J of 100,000(. a year, in the Southern Customs, which could be pie 3 elsewhere.3 ($) Also, in the past there have been repeated reports that Russia has been clandestinely, through Native agency, trying to obtain control of the Crown Lands in Seistan, and it has also been asserted that she has tried to obtain the revenue of Seistan as security for a loan. If, under financial pressure, either of these concessions were granted to Russia, our relations with that Power would be seriously strained. In order to forestall Russia here also, it would seem advisable to grant the loan, provided Persia agrees (i) to include the Seistan revenues among the collateral securities, and (ii) not to borrow on the same security from any other Power. Roth these conditions have been suggested before. It is true that they have been rejected, but circumstances have changed. And though it would not be advisable to make these conditions a sine qua non, still it is worth while trying to get them if we can. Additional reasons for the grant of the loan are— (i.) Por many years the relations between the British and Persian Govern ments have not been satisfactory. We have not come to Persia’s assistance financially as Russia has done. Persia has naturally felt sore, and has become distrustful and suspicious. At the same time she has fallen more and more under Russian influence, and in her desire to please Russia has been forced into even a greater show of hostility to us than she probably desires. Hence our trouble in Reistan and elsewhere ; the constant obstruc tion to our trade by the Belgian officers of the Customs department; the continual and often undignified struggle to secure fair play to our trade which is constantly going on between our officers in South-East Persia and the Persian officials;. hence also the difficulties about our boundaries, and the unaccommodating spirit shown in regard to the Seistan arbitration and other matters. Greater friendliness on the part of the Persian Government would probably at once solve or lessen these difficulties, and greater friendliness is likely to follow financial assistance, and is worth paying for. On the other hand, a refusal to help at this crisis will force Persia still further under the unwelcome Russian yoke, and her hostility towards and irritation with us will be doubled. (ii.) We need not fear that, the relief being only temporary, we shall be forced into further loans. If we obtain the concessions we want, we can always refuse to go further. There is little fear of Persia breaking up immediately. At any rate, she will not break up before Russia recovers. These primitive—uncivilized—nations do not perish so easily, and if we refuse it,, there is little doubt that Persia can get elsewhere the help that is immediately needed. (iii.) A time may shortly come, after Russia is more at rest, when His Majesty’s Government may wish to try and come to some understanding with that Power as regards our interests in the East. The possibility of such an entente has been discussed in the English and Russian press. When the time comes, the more we have in our hands to bargain with the better. The argument “ beati possidentes” is likely to be of much force in such a contingency, for any understanding will certainly in the main be based on the status quo. Should we not therefore endeavour to obtain all the concessions we can while we have the opportunity ? Persia is hard jDressed for money, the Russian terms for a loan will probably be harder than ours, and the Shah is never likely to be more ready than at present to grant what we ask.4~ (iv.) The truth is that we have now an opportunity of strengthening our position such as we have not seen for more than a generation, and it is an opportunity that may never come again. Until within the last five years British influence in Persia had been steadily waning, while that of Bussia had been constantly on the increase. In the past five years, owing to the active policy adopted by the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government, our officers have held, hut have only just held, their own. We have doubled the number of our Consulates, we have opened the Nushki trade route, and we have everywhere shown a firm front to Russian encroachment and intrigue. But the hope of achieving more than this seemed till lately very remote. Now, thanks to the Japanese War, Russia is for the moment discredited; her influence and prestige are weakened; her usual watchful attention is diverted elsewhere; and her material resources and ability to advance money are lessened. At no time prior to the war would Persia have come to us for so large a sum, or, if she had, would Russia have failed to check her. Noa\ Persia sees her chance to escape in some measure from her enforced sub servience to Russia, and we have the opportunity for which we have so patiently waited. Por the sake of the continuity of our policy, surely the opportunity should be seized. Otherwise all that has been effected by our recent activity, at the cost of infinite care and labour, is likely to be imperilled. Every circumstance is favourable to a successful deal. Persia is eager for help. Russia is quiescent. The Indian Government is obviously prepared to find the money. The loan would he well secured. We run practically no financial risk. In fact, we make a profit, for we borrow at 3J to lend at 4 per cent. The political risk is small, and is not to he compared with the risk which we incur if we alienate Persia still further by a refusal. In the latter case we have only Lord Lansdowne’s declarations to rely upon, and these obviously will avail us little unless they are carried into action, and we forbid the grant to others of the concessions which we will not acquire for ourselves. Lastly, a Liberal Government is in power, whose known aversion to aggrandisement may help to persuade the Persians to believe that we have no ulterior motives behind our demands, and that in asking for the concessions suggested, we honestly desire to protect, and will actually protect, their interests as well as our own. In short, it may be urged, with absolute truth, that of the two alternatives before us, to grant the loan is the safe course to adopt, and that to refuse it is the dangerous one. The former can only at the worst bring us into a financial controversy with Persia, the latter may and almost certainly will bring us sooner or later into serious collision with Russia. If this he true, those who would let the present opportunity slip, will obviously incur a very grave responsibility, and may before long find themslves in difficulties, from which it will require all their address to extricate themselves. On the other hand, if the opportunity is taken an skilfully used, not only will some measure of success crown the anxious efforts of the past five years, but it is probable that we shall be freed from anxiety as to Russian encroachment on our interests in Persia for severa years to come. J H. S. Bahnes. 8th January 1906. oo „ T I * * * |: S ' n °te was written tbe telegram from the Government of India dated 9th instant has been received. It confirms the view that the Government of India are ready to lend money to Persia, but the conditions which they suggest do not appear to be suitable. The general objection to em is that they go too far, and that they raise some matters that are controversial and others that are of little immediate importance. It is clearly undesirable to court a refusal by asking for too much, and things of secondary interest must be excluded from our demands. Per example Persia has already agreed, if a further loan is given, to promise us priority in railway construction in Southern Persia and Seistan. If there is reason to think that Persia will object, it hardly seems desirable to complicate the case by adoing canals and roads, in which immediate competition by others is unlikely. Again, we do not want specific concessions, which involve obligation. Prom Major Morton’s inquiries it seems that, except in return for very large outlay, there is little profit to be obtained from irrigation from the Karim ; levies in the Baklitiari country would be very expensive and of doubtful utility; and to construct a road from Bunder Abbas to Baiii would be a, costly and most speculative undertaking. The linking up of the telegraph between Nasratabad in Seistan and our frontier post at Robat would no doubt be a great convenience. But its utility is so obvious that it must come in due course, and all the quicker if Persia’s friendly feelings are stimulated by a loan. There is no difficulty in finding things for which we can ask. The Government of India might also have mentioned the acceptance of the Seistan Water Award, the grant of land for the telegraph station at Henjam, or the pavment of our outstanding claims of 20,000/. Except, perhaps, the last, none of these are suitable for mention in connection with a loan, and all things considered it seems best to confine ourselves to the conditions suggested in the foregoing note. 10th January 1906. Note by Sir Dennis Fitzpatrick. I do not like to detain these papers until I get hold of the earlier correspondence; but, speaking from what is in this file and from my recollection of the matter, I will make a few observations. I believe most of ns have agreed to the advances already made, at the joint risk of the Treasury and the Indian revenues, in order to relieve Persia for a time from the necessity of having recourse to Russia, and in order to prevent Russia from getting hold of the customs of the southern ports. Whether we should, for these or other similar objects, agree to advance anything beyond the balance of the amount we have already agreed with the Foreign Office to advance, is a question for discussion. But, whatever may he thought on it, I should be most strongly opposed to the idea of advancing money or taking any other step with a view to securing for ourselves, now or ultimately, a protectorate or any other position in respect of Southern Persia or Seistan, which v r e should have to defend on the spot when (if ever) the time of trouble arrived. I am, as I have always been, S. 37. B6 stronflv opposed to anything of that sort, because our military advisers have repeatedly told us that we have not the military force to defend such a position in Southern Persia, and, though some have said we might manage to do so in Seistan, they seem to have spoken with reference to Russia’s present position, and without adverting to the probability that as Persia declines Russia will advance well towards the south in Khorassan, ami will accordingly, before the critical time comes, or perhaps I should say before she elects to bring the crisis on, he in considerable force in that neighbourhood. I have indeed heard it suggested that it would he a good thing for us to take up some sort of position in Seistan or some other part of Persia so as to check the advance of the Russians until they were actually ready to go to war with us, and then abandon it and attack Russia in some other part of the world, but few, I think, would approve of a course involving the abandonment of such a position after we had once taken ^As to the Russians establishing a naval base or a fortified position on the shores of the Gulf, I presume our navy could always prevent that. One word move. I should have thought that there would not be the least chance of Persia conceding to us any position anywhere that might lead up to anything in the way of a protectorate, unless, indeed, she was reduced to the very last extremity. Even our harping on our predominant interests ” in the south and in Seistan seems to irritate the Persian authorities, as it gives the impression that we are looking out for what is to fall to us when the break-up comes. This, however, is a matter for the Eoreign Office and our Minister in Persia rather than for us. D. Fitzpatrick. 30th December 1905. Further Note by Sir Dennis Fitzpatrick. 1. In the hurried note I wrote on the 30th ultimo, I confined myself to recording a protest against our advancing money or taking any other steps with a view to securing for ourselves, now or ultimately, a protectorate or any other position in respect of Southern Persia or Seistan, which we should have to defend on the spot by force of arms when (if ever) the time of trouble arrived. •My object in recording that protest was to support the observation as to a protectorate made by Sir E. Grey, and on this all-important point I have now only one further remark to make. An outsider reading some of the papers before us might suppose that there was no need to discuss such a point, that no one had any desire to establish for Bn 0 a auv position of the sort in question, hut this is not so. M e nave, kes ^ the proposal of certain military authorities to locate a British force in Seistan, the following:— _ f (1.) Lord Curzon’s grand scheme for taking possession of the line o the Helmund from the neighbourhood of Candahar down to Seistan, establishing a proper system of canals, and effecting the “ regeneration ” of Seistan.7 (2.) Certain proposals to raise levies in the west of Persia, which levies we should have to support with a strong force of British troops in a time of serious trouble. (3.) The proposal, in certain eventualities, to support the Sheikh of Mohamerah against the Shah. (Defence Committee, 22nd March 1905.) (4.) The proposal, by providing funds for irrigation and the improve ment of communications, to “ establish a reversionary interest . . . which might be valuable in the event of a break up “of Persia.” {Ibid.) (5.) The proposal made to Russia, but declined by her, for “the partition of Persia into spheres of influence,” which in the ordinary course would be certain to develop into protectorates {Ibid.) 2. To turn now to the question which in my previous note I reserved for consideration, namely, whether, putting aside all suggestions for the establishment of a position of the sort above referred to, it might not be desirable to advance more money to Persia simply— Firstly, to relieve Persia from the necessity of having recourse to Russia for financial aid ; and, Secondly, to forestall Russia in getting hold of the Customs of the Southern ports ; and other such like advantages. I think that, save in very exceptional circumstances, we ought not to advance money to Persia for the first of these objects taken alone. It seems to me that it would be utterly vain for us to enter into competition with Russia in the financing of Persia. Russia, supposing her to recover her*“ and hold to^ethci, has an immense object to gain in tightening her hold on Persia. She can look forward to ultimately establishing a protec torate, or something more, over the whole or the greater part of the country; and it would pay her well to lavish money for the attainment of that object. We, on the contrary, though we can maintain our supremacy in the waters of the Gulf, must, as I have said, abandon all hope of establishing for ourselves on land any position at all similar to that to which Russia can look forward. We must be satisfied with thwarting and delaying Russia, and there is obviously a limit to the amount which it would be worth our while to advance for that purpose. It is no doubt worth while doing a good deal to check Russia’s advance to Seistan, but it must be remembered she is already within 60 or SO miles of Herat, which is infinitely worse. For these reasons it seems to me that, save in very exceptional circumstances, we ought not to advance more money to Persia unless we can secure something of the second kind above-mentioned, that is to say, unless we can forestall Russia in obtaining some advantage like a hold on the Customs of the Southern ports. 3. Next to consider the particular advantages which Sir II. Barnes proposes we should seek to obtain in consideration of our loan. I have always been disposed, in regard to such matters, to be guided by the Foreign Office and our Minister at Teheran who are responsible for our relations with Persia, who are more familiar with the state of things out there than any of us can pretend to be, and who share equally with us the responsibility for whatever pecuniary risk there may be in these loan S. 37. 0s transactions; but I will make a few observations for what they may be worth. 4 And first as regards the Customs of the Southern po.fe If Sir H Barnes is right in thinking that our hold on them would not be fully secured bv the transactions of April 1903 and September 1904, and .he 150,0001. , ' transaction which was recently under consideration, and may peihaps Sill be regarded as pending, and if our complete hold could be secured by advancing something more, I would not oppose a further advance It would not (I take it) commit us to anything serious. If a considerable detain occurred and we had to enforce our security, I presume it would simply mean putting subordinate officers into the customs houses as collectors n it i a ew Levs as a guard. We would have armed vessels about m the Gulf, which, if any serious trouble was apprehended anywhere, would take up a position m front of the port, and, if the worst came to the worst, the collec oi non pack up his cash and his books and go on hoard a ship until everyth,ng was secure again. 5 The proposal to acquire exclusive rights in regard to railway con struction is not so simple. Sir H. Barnes says that there is no present desire on our part to use railway rights granted in South Persia, hut be speaks o the possihilitv of a railway being made by a British company from the Gulf to Ispahan, ‘jusd as one might speak of the possibility of a railway being constructed hv a British company in some civilised State (say) maouth America. It must, however, be remembered that the sort ot P 10 ^ ot ^ should have to afford to a British company constructing and wo km a railway in Persia would be widely different from the protection tha would be expected from us by a British company whose line lay m a civilised Sta e do not suppose any British company, or the British Government itself would dream of constructing a railway in Persia unless it was understood hat in a time of serious trouble a military force would be available to protect i , and that is just the thing it is so important for ns to avoid. If, bowevm i would he possible to make a “ dog-in-the-manger arrangement pme . simple, that is to say, that it would he well understood that, w i e we si ^ be entitled to object to anyone else receiving a concession, we s under no sort of obligation to make or promote railways ourselves ami tha “ mean in do ..jiHim, tf «. U* I «** * »• might well he considered. 6. There remains Sir H. Barnes’ proposal to get such a charge on tlie land revenues of Seistan as would prevent Bussia or anyone e se 1 getting a charge on them, and it is to be observed that it similar proposal regarding the Customs of the Soutiem poi s m out . would prohablv, in the event of default, be found impossible o i security by collecting the revenue, unless we were prepared to assume, ^ “11,1 ™.i, S» government o. tie c.mtev .mU, „.M - in doing ». Th», ten, ..»« W open in ***£*£ at star tin o', and I accordingly could not support Su . ' _ ,, t unless it was distinctly placed on official record that it is not ^ we should exercise any right we might have to collect reven ^ ourselves. If this was not distinctly placed on record time ^ „ n „ ious risk that, if those who might come after us some years hence wereto get hold of Seistan, they would place officers supported hy troops out there to collect the revenue, and say that in doing so they were only carrying out an arrangement made by us. I have only to add as regards this proposal that Persia seems, owing to causes which it is unnecessary to mention, to have come of late to conceive such a suspicion of our intentions that 1 fear there is little chance of her agreeing to it. 7. As regards the sufficiency of the security proposed I give no opinion. I am content on this as on the previous occasions to leave that and all other details in the hands of the Poreign Office, who will have the carrying out of any arrangement that may he made, and who share the risk with us. There is, however, one point of detail which ought to be considered in this Office, and that is whether whatever is done is to be kept secret. The difficulty that arose on a previous occasion about showing the amount in Indian Accounts will be remembered, and the amount now proposed, being so much larger, is more likely to attract attention. D. PlTZPATRICK. 9th January 1908. P.S.—I think, having regard to the complication and delicacy of the questions before us, that we ought not to set about preparing an official reply to the Poreign Office until they have seen our notes, and the matter is to some extent thrashed out unofficially. D. P. P. Note by Sir John Edge. I am in favour of granting the loan. It appears to me to be greatly to our advantage to prevent, if possible, the chance of Persia borrowing further at present from Russia. Hard pressed as Russia may be now for money, I conceive that Russia could easily raise the amount required on the security that Persia has to give. Purther, Russia might obtain a lien on the revenues of Seistan. We know that Russia has been intriguing to obtain a foothold in Seistan, and if we refuse the loan we throw Persia into the arms of Russia, and in that case Russia will be able to obtain her own terms. I would grant the loan mainly on the security of the southern customs and get rid of the still difficult question as to the meaning of “ the customs of Pars and of the Persian Gulf.” The revenues of the Casnian x. fisheries are to my mind worthless to us as a security. It would, I think, be useless to propose to Persia that the revenues of Seistan should be a collateral security. Persia, not without some reason having been afforded to her, suspects our intentions with regard to Seistan, but she would possibly agree, as one of the conditions for the loan, that she would give us the first option, should it become necessary for her to borrow on the security of the revenue of Seistan.10 We must not think of any occupation of Persian territory in Seistan or elsewhere on the mainland. We would he too far from our base, and would only court disaster in the event of a war with Russia, a disaster which would have serious effects if we had to defend India against mvasiou by Russia. Our fleet could not prevent Russia, if she were in force, taking, fortifying, and holding a harbour in or near the Gulf, and a mere blockade by our fleet could not he indefinitely prolonged. I have said that it appears to me to he greatly to our advantage to prevent, if possible, the chance of Persia borrowing further at present from Russia. Time is everything to ns. We could not by arms prevent Russia taking Persia, but, in the not distant future, I foresee that Germany will have interests in Persia which would be destroyed if Persia became practically a Russian province; and when the German trading interests in Persia have become developed Russia, will have to deal with Germany as well as with us. lu the Persian Gu i Germany could do practically nothing as against Russia without our assistance, and could do nothing as against us, hut Germany could put such pressure on Russia in Europe as would prevent Russia annexing Persia.

I would not abate one jot of the onerous terms upon which the Government of India would advance a further loan to Persia, and I should regard without regret Persia’s refusal of the loan. Por I cannot entirely agree with Sir Hugh Barnes that “ greater friendliness is likely to follow financial assistance,” or that “ we need not fear that we shall be forced into further loans.” These loans which are not productive and are wasted upon Court extravagance do not, I think, make for friendliness. On the contrary, we have it on record that a strong, popular, and priestly influence in Persia is bitterly hostile to foreigners, et dona ferentes. The friendliness of the nation is not secured by them, nor are the Shah and his Ministers made bv these means more friendly to us. Since we advanced our first loan they have shown greater opposition to our wishes. They have rejected the Seistan award, refused telegraph concessions, raised customs difficulties, and in no single respect shown even proper regard for our rights. A creditor is rarely the friend of an embarrassed debtor. Then as to our being foiced into further loans. The real fact is that we have so far lent on an inferior security to that which we asked for and intended, and we have been already forced into further loans in order to try and make good that security. It is a matter of ordinary exjDerience that one mistake leads to another, and one loan to another. The real issue, however, is. whether another loan will serve our policy. T\ hat is our policy towards Persia ? So far as I can form an opinion it is this. The exclusion of Bussia from Afghanistan^ whether in the form of invasion or pacific penetration is, I think, vital. We must go to war if Bussia crosses the Afghan borders. But if Bussia should cross the Persian borders we should not, I think, resist by force of arms, first because the Persians, unlike the Afghans, could offer no resistance, secondly, because the field of action would be too far off. Hence our policy is not to commit ourselves to even the threat of an immediate conflict with Bussia should she invade Persia. But bearing in mind that the Afghan western border is open on the Persian side and would be threatened by a Bussian occupation of Persia, w r e should have to be prepared for war so as to prevent the Afghan border being crossed, and if Bussia should invade Persian territory we should protest and encourage other nations to join us in protesting against v iolation of the independence of Persia. Have we already got the right to employ diplomatic weapons against Bussia in defence of Persian integrity? W 7 e have acquired the right, for we have publicly declared that we can consent to the establishment of no fortified places on the Gulf; we have lent money to Persia and obtained some sort of security; we have settled differences between Persia and our ally Afghanistan, and w^e have established consulates and supported British companies trading in Persia. This being so, and military resistance for the defence of Persia being beyond S. 37. D jM a17th January 1906. om- powers, will any further loan materially assist us ? I venture to doubt it, and since Indian revenues are to make the advance I submit that we should m no case accept any less security than the Government of India desire to accept. We have already, in my opinion, made that mistake, and I would not repeat it. When Sir M. .Durand first proposed a loan the idea found no favour with us. We felt that one loan would lead to another, and the money would make Persia neither stronger nor more friendly. Then a change of policy was made, and we consulted Lord Curzon, who in October 1901 offered to provide 500,000/., if an “adequate return” were secured. Oui Ministei was only too glad to get this financial weapon to assist him in dealing with Persia. Part of the loan wns advanced, hut the full return required by the Government of India w^as not then, nor has it since been* secured. The question now is whether we should largely increase our advances to improve the security which w^e did get. In my opinion we should certainly lend nothing to which we are not already pledged, except on the terms suggested by the Government of India, and, if v^e do not get those terms, we lose very little. For our present position fully justifies us in resisting Russian encroachments by diplomatic means, and in attempting to induce other European powers to take part with us in asserting the independence of Persia, and that seems all that we can aim at. We can at the same time repeat in the strongest language our determination to uphold the integrity of Afghanistan, and if Prussia does advance into Persia we must be prepared to meet that solemn obligation. If our advances to Persia were honestly applied to the improvement of its administration the case might be different, but they only add to the extravagance of the Court, and the additional financial fetters which they impose on Persia are not needed by us to justify our diplomatic resistance to Russian encroachment.

Should he not be able to raise money he may fall and the former Grand Vizier, who was Russophil, may return, there being no other probable candidate. Present Grand Vizier hates all foreigners, but is, I think, somewhat better disposed to us than to the Russians. I have with the greatest difficulty obtained from his Highness a paper, counter signed by the Shah, agreeing to pay 750,000 tomans to the Imperial Bank of Persia in* two months. This will save Directors a disagreeable interview with shareholders at their meeting- to-day.

Mr- Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received December 23.) (No. 772.) St. Petersburgh, December 16, 1905. WITH reference to Mr. Grant Duff’s telegram No. 164 of the 1st instant, on the subject of the financial condition of Persia, I have the honour to state that I had some conversation to-day with the Persian Minister here on this matter. He acknowledged that the Peisian Government was in a situation of some embarrassment with regard to its finances,^ hut he told me that he had recently received a telegram from the Grand Viziei, stating that an immediate loan was not required, as the proposed reorganization of the ainiy and Administration would not be carried out at once. He assured me that no negotiations were being carried on through him, and that he did not believe the Russian Government had much confidence in M. Speyer, the Russian Minister in Tehran, vho had recently been summoned to St. Petersburgh. With regard to the general question of an advance of money to meet the requirements of the Persian Government, he stated that M!. Vlassorv, the late Russian Minister at Tehran, had urged the Persian Government to accept a Russian Controller in return for a loan, and that the Grand Vizier had refused to accept such a condition. M. Vlassow had insisted that Turkey, which was a great Power, had accepted a similar condition in the form of the Inter national Commissioners of the Debt, and that her independence had not suffered. The Persian Government, however, had steadily objected, on the ground that the appoint ment of a _sole Russian Controller would lead to the loss of independence. Wliile accepting the justice of this view, the Persian Minister observed that a loan without some form of control would only lead to the ruin of Persia, as the money would be spent on subsidies to favourites without any advantage to the State. He hoped some day to see his country have recourse to Europe in general, and not to Russia or England, for financial aid, especially for the construction of railways; and he complained bitterly of the jealousy between the two countries, which made it, he said, impossible for his country to develop its resources as other countries had done, by improving the means of communication. With regard to the relations between England and Russia, while expressing the hope that they would improve, as such an improvement would be of the greatest service to Persia, he did not, he said, believe that Russia would ever consent to sign a Treaty with England with regard to Persia, such as had been agreed on by England and France with regard to Siam. Long years were, he thought, necessary before the views of Russia would change to that extent. At the present moment it would be a mistake to suppose that the interest of Russia in Persia had slackened. The failure of Russia’s attempt to obtain an access to warm water in the Far East could only result in increasing her desire to obtain command of a port in the South. On the other hand, the state of internal politics, the recent lesson in Manchuria, and, above all, the Anglo- Japanese Treaty would act as formidable deterrents. On the whole, he thought that Russia would remain quiescent as regards Persia for some time to come, and he hoped that this period would he utilized by Persia in reforming herself, and by Russia and England in arriving at a friendly understanding. Count Lamsdorff had, he said, expressed himself in a similar sense on a recent occasion. The Minister quoted the words used by his Excellency, which were : “We want to remain quiet in Persia, and will do so, as long as you make no betises.” It is, of course, possible that overtures are now being made here with a view to a Russian loan to Persia on condition of the acceptance of Russian financial control; but, if so, the language of the Persian Minister is hard to reconcile with such a fact, as he spoke in strong language as to the difficulty which a foreign Controller, acting- alone, would have in facing the instinct of independence ingrained in the Persian people.
