Dear Sir, I note from your letter No.c/^S of 20tn February that the Political Agent sees certain objections to the f°i™ of the proposed licence for Cable and Wireless working at Bahrain. The position in Bahrain appears very similar to that in Aden where there is no telegraph system beyond that of our Gomoany. There the licence is exclusive and was granted for a period of fifty years (or possibly only I 4 .O) in the first instance and renewed for a period of 20 years and is subject to an annua payment of Rs 10/-. The position in Cyprus, Zanzibar and Seychelles is almost identical with that in Aden. For a licence in Karachi the Indian Government has also fixed the annual payment at Rs 10/-. The avowed policy of the British Government is that Cable and Wireless should carry Fmpire traffic wherever possible and although Bahrain is not British Smptte I think it sa,e to say that the policy of the Bahrain Government as regards communications would be to exclude foreign companies. This is tantamount to granting a monopoly to Cable and Wireless and it is conceivable that the Bahrain Government might be glad to be able to cojsnron possible applicants witn a ’’fait accompli « I shall be glad if you will see the Political Agent again on this subject and try to obtain his agreement to a licence on the lines of those suggested. If you will notify me by cable of any modifications he requires I will submit them to Head Office for approval. Yours fiithfuily, (sd) H. A.

PE£Lv STATEMENT of proposed changes in the arrange ments between His Majesty’s Government and Cable and Wireless Limited, and of a reduction in Empire cable and wireless rates. Presented to Parliament by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury by Command of His Majesty April, 1938 LONDON PRINTED AND PUBLISHED BY HIS MAJESTY’S STATIONERY OFFICE To be purchased directly from H.M. STATIONERY OIFICE at the following addresses : Adastral House, Kingsway, London, W.C.2 ; 120 George Street, Edinburgh 2 ; 26 York Street, Manchester 1 ; 1 St. Andrew’s Crescent, Cardiff; 80 Chichester Street, Belfast; or through any booksell-r Price id. net Cmd. 5716CABLE AND WIRELESS LIMITED 1. A Bill will shortly be laid before Parliament to authorize certain changes in the arrangements between His Majesty’s jovernment in the United Kingdom and Cable and Wireless limited, the Company which was charged with the conduct )f the main overseas telegraph services of the British Common wealth as the outcome of the Report of the Imperial Wireless ind Cable Conference of 1928 (Command Paper No. 3163 of [928). The relations between the British Commonwealth Gov- jrnments concerned and the Companies in the cable and wireless nerger are defined in the Agreements made in pursuance of that Report (Command Paper No. 3338 of 1929). 2. The policy then agreed upon was to provide for co-opera- ion among the Governments for the maintenance and develop- nent under British control of the overseas cable and wireless telegraph system of the Empire operating through private mteiprise in the United Kingdom, but under quasi-public utility xmditions. This policy has in recent years become endangered, )artly because the operating Company has been unable to earn he revenue which it was expected to receive under the new con ditions, and has thus been unable to reduce the telegraph tariffs :o the extent which had been hoped (although very substantial 'eductions of tariffs were made with corresponding benefit to the Dublic) and partly owing to the threat of foreign competition Dn Empire routes, by the introduction of new direct wireless services competing with the Company’s system. In view Df these difficulties, the Governments concerned, with the idvice and assistance of the Imperial Communications Advisory Committee, which was appointed by the Govern ments as part of the 1928 scheme, have for some time past been engaged in reviewing the position. As a result of this review, and of subsequent negotiations with Cable and Wireless Limited, certain proposals have emerged, to which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, with the general assent of the Governments of the Dominions and of India, are prepared, subject to the authority of Parliament, to give their approval. 3. The proposed settlement calls for financial sacrifices by the United Kingdom and most of the overseas Governments, and by the Company and its associates, but these, it is believed, will be offset by the benefits which will accrue to all parties, and particularly to the public users of the Company’s system. 4. The main purport of the proposed settlement is threefold. First, it provides for an immediate and substantial reduction 3 f Empire telegraph rates, and makes it more easily possible F -Qr further reductions to be effected in future if the expected .mulus to traffic should make this practicable. Secondly, it relieves the present strain on the finances of Cable and■ A 4 Wireless Limited by providing for the exchange of the pri\yi charge on the Company’s revenues which His Majesty’s Govei T 0 i ment now hold (in the form of a rental for the Beam Wireltpai Stations which were leased to the Company by the Post Off] in 1928), for an interest in the equity of the undertaking, k^x thirdly, the Governments concerned are asked, in confirmatii ( of the policy agreed in 1928, to accord their fullest support aiby co-operation to the Company’s system, thus enabling tipf Company to provide with greater confidence for the futuam development of its services. uh 5. The object of this memorandum is to describe shortly tbei more important proposals, and particularly those of a financiten nature which affect the United Kingdom Exchequer. sio: 6. Under the arrangements which were approved in 1928, falsi four Beam Wireless Stations in the United Kingdom whicnm were owned by His Majesty’s Postmaster General and he previously been operated by him, were leased to the Compan (together with the free use of certain telegraphic circuits require ( for the working of the stations) for a period of 25 year it &gt; terminating in 1953, in return for a rental, known as ttexc Beam Rental ”, payable to the Post Office during the sanha] period and consisting of— tn: {a) a fixed annual payment of ^250,000; and a P (6) 12 per cent, of the surplus profits, if any, earned!) ™ the Company in any year above a certain level. ^ The fixed annual rental of £250,000 has been duly paid by tt 1 Company throughout, but the profits earned have never bee sufficient to provide any additional payment under (6). ; on Financial Arrangements. 7 -—(i) It is now proposed that Cable and Wireless Limite shall be granted the freehold of the Beam Wireless Statioi t a ] aforesaid, and that the Beam rental shall be cancelled, wit tei effect from the 1st March, 1938. (ii) In consideration of this concession, it is proposed th: there shall be transferred to His Majesty’s Government in t! United Kingdom, without payment, 2,600,000 £1 shares i a p Cable and Wireless Limited, to be found from the existir q 0 issued capital of the Company (£30,000,000) by agreemei 0 f between the parties concerned. 0 f (iii) As part of the general settlement, it is proposed tha m( His Majesty’s Postmaster General shall waive a claim for co small payment from Cable and Wireless Limited in respect c p a the right conceded to the Company to operate a wireless telf a graph service with Kenya in place of that previously operate ^ by the General Post Office. a i] (iv) It is proposed that the Anglo-Continental telegrap' :o services operated by the General Post Office and Cable an 0 f5 priWireless Limited respectively, shall be co-ordinated under a °vei joint Purse working arrangement to be concluded between the W parties.

The Standard Revenue was fixed in 1928 at ^1,865,000 ed D per annum, being approximately 6 per cent, on the capital of , ,, the Company. ky Under the arrangements now contemplated, the Standard ^ ee Revenue will, in effect, be written down to a figure of 4 P er cent, on the capital, or ^1,200,000 per annum. Strategic Cables. roifr (vii) In arriving at the general settlement, account has been a ^ 0 . r taken of the obligations of the Company in regard to the main- tenance of cables which may be required for strategic purposes. 1 th; Reduction of Overseas Telegraph Rates. ^ (viii) As a condition of these proposals the Company have e 8 / also agreed to introduce a far-reaching scheme for the reduc- ishr tion 0 f overseas telegraph rates. This scheme is the outcome sme: 0 f discussions between representatives of the Governments and of the Company. Its main provision is that, subject to agree- l tk rnent being reached with the administrations and other parties f° r concerned, rates for full rate traffic between all the different ec i c parts of the Empire are to be reduced so far as practicable to ; ™ a uniform basis. This uniform basis is to be is. 3d. a word ^rate ( w ith a code rate of lod. a word), but existing rates which are already below this level will not be increased. There will be grap^onsequential reductions in certain rates for the cheaper classes ' an of traffic which are proportional to the full rate. It is the6 (47084—1) Wt. 1867—1928 1250 4/38 P.

The benefit of the reductions on tel graphic rates to the public, at home and overseas, is estimated! amount to nearly £500,000 per annum. In addition to the sped financial arrangement made by the United Kingdom Coven ment, without which the reductions would not have been poss ble, the new tariffs involve concessions of varying amounts 0 the part of overseas Governments. But the main burden wi fall on the Company itself and its associates. 8. The Directors have agreed to these proposals. 9. The figure of 2,600,000 for the number of shares in th Company to be issued to the United Kingdom Government i a u ^ re ne § 0 ^ a ^ e( ^ as P ar t of the general settlement, based upoi the discounted present value of the outstanding payments of tb Beam rental until the end of the present lease in 1953. 10. The surrender of the fixed Beam rental of £250,000 pav able annually under the existing lease until 1953, in retun for such income as may be received from the dividends on tht Government’s new holding of 2,600,000 shares in the Coin pany, represents a substantial sacrifice on the part of Hi: Majesty s Government in terms of revenue. The Beam renh h^ hitherto been paid to the Post Office; but, in viev of the wider public issues involved in the proposed financia arrangements with the Company, it has been agreed betweer the Treasury and the Post Office that the net consequentia loss in excess of £100,000 per annum shall be borne by tht Exchequer. This will require a modification of the arrange ments governing the Fixed Exchequer Contribution payable by the Post Office under Part IV of the Finance Act, 1933, a: extended by Section 32 of the Finance Act, 1937, for whicl statutory authority will be sought in due course. 11. His Majesty s Government are satisfied that as a cor tnbution to the general settlement the cost of the proposed concession is outweighed by the great importance, alike on political, commercial and strategic grounds, of maintaining intact the system of Imperial communications carried on by the Company.POLI- It';Ali ( .

The Political Agent, 14 th Pebruarylg^.. Dear Sir, Bahrain. Bahrain Aerial Lines to the Gable House. / Since the landing of the Bushire-Bahrain cable under licence from His Highness the Sheikh of Bahrain the land connection by aerial lines has been carried on temporary poles erected at the Company^ expense by the State Engineering Department. Owing to the poor condition of this line it has now become necessary to re—erect it on a permanent basis with steel poles arid other equipment which is being sent from England. The route 'of the existing line has been surveyed by the Company’s Engineer and his report contains references to the various difficulties which have to be met in erecting and maintaining the lines in the future. In order that the whole position should be made clear to you I append a copy of the report itself. Prom this you will observe that the main obstacles to be overcome are dbess to private property to put down anchor stays and the* necessity to trim overhanging growth both during erection and subsequently at any time inspection shows that the growth is endangering communication through the likelihood to fall across the wires or cause a connection to earth through contact. In originally granting the wayleave along this road and the land for the cable house I am sure His Excellency appreciated the importance of the communication facilities afforded to his subjects by the landing of the cable and no doubt intended that the route, being a highway, should remain available for the aerial landline connection between the office and the cable head.I therefore seek your kind offices in approaching the Bahrain Government to ask His Excellency to consider if he would graciously grant the Company^ Officers permission to enter the land belonging to the Ruling Family during erection of the new line and a general permission to trim the over hanging growth from time to time; and furthermore where the land belongs to other private owners if His Excellency could kindly use his influence to obtain similar permission from these owners; it being understood that any small damage done during erection to the existing fences would be made good and the trimming of trees from time to time would be carried out under the supervision of a responsible officer with the minimum of interference. It will be appreciated that the erection of a permanent line of about a mile and a half is a considerable expense and as a rule a wayleave guarantees that the line will not be subject to interference by third parties and if the felling of trees becomes necessary the Company is duly advised so that they may have a responsible officer present to protect their interests. Yours faithfully, Divisional Manager, Persian Gulf. Enel.1 F. A* D.BAHRAIN. 6 th February 1939. The Officer-in-Charge, Bahrain. / REPORT ON AERIAL LANDLIHE SURVEY. (From Point ^ - termination of U core U/G Gable House. This was commenced towards the end of January, various other urgent matters having delayed this work. It was not possible to borrow surveying instruments from the Government Departments - the only useful item available being a measuring chain which was checked up before using. The Landline route beyond present pole No. 9 is outside the Municipal area and there are apparently no maps or surveys of the country beyond this point. Accordingly, the enclosed plan has been made up from our measurements. To obtain the angles of poles, direction of roads etc., bearings were taken using our local repair compass. For mapping purposes, the compass readings were corrected for variation. In order that this map may be used conjointly with the existing map of the underground lines, our compass readings were further adjusted in order that true north in relation to the top edge of the plan is the same in both cases. This was done as Mr. Skinner 1 plan of the U/Gs was, it is understood, based partly on a local map, true north of which is at an angle of 3° degrees with the top edge of the plan. The plan comprises two sections - from present pole No. 1 to No. 22 and from No. 22 to the Gable House. These have been drawn on the same piece of tracing paper to economise space as this has to be despatched by air mail. The existing wooden poles have been numbered starting with No. 1 with the pole adjacent to Point ’X* where the 4 core U/G is sealed and buried. The present line was laid out with 200 feet spans, the pole numbers have been marked in black on the plan. The proposed positions for the new poles on a basis of 40 yard spans are shewn in red. At points where a new pole will take the place of an existing one the black figure is also ringed in red. Although our present line is partially overgrown by trees in places, it is difficult to see how the present alignment could be improved upon without frequent zigzags across the road as, although in some places the road is clearer for short dis tances on the opposite side there are also many stretches where the trees are decidedly worse. It is obvious that when this temporary line was erected in 1935/36 it was then clear of trees; these have grown over since. As the proposed new line must follow the alignment of the present one, some arrangement will have to be made with the owners of the land - through a responsible authority - .in order that these trees may be periodically trimmed. Hitherto, major repairs to our lines have mostly been carried out by State Engineer*s department; it is noted that the State Engineer has generally shewn reluctance to interfere with trees. He states that there are difficulties with the owners - in some cases the Ruling Family. When it was pointed out that these trees often overhang the highway, he replied that the owners each side of the road consider that they own the road as well. Now that the main road from present pole 9 to No. 29 is being made up, in order to relieve the Jebel road of some traffic 3 perhaps this argument will no longer carry the same weight. The road surfaces are plain earth. During the rainy season from November to February the roads become very bad indeed - for the rest of the year the surface is dust. The soil is loose and the present wooden poles v/ere sunk into rough cement beds. Stays should also be secured in the same manner. A strata of rock is usually encountered at depths varying from 1 to 3 feet. There is an outcrop of rock in the middle of the road opposite present pole 25. The stays of the present poles in some places pass over or through date fencing into gardens. This will have to be borne in mind when negotiating with owners regarding the trimming of their trees. Some of our new poles will have to be similar*-! v stavpn as- 2 - 1 V/ith the exception of two small stretches - from Point , X t to present pole 3, and along the north side of the road bordering the Cemetery between present poles 7 and 10 - the whole of the route is fenced each side with date or brushwood fencing. Prom Point ’X’ to pole 3&gt; the line is clear. This is shewn in photograph No. 1. Prom pole 3 to pole 5 there is a risk of contacts if the trees are allowed to grow over the road. This can be seen in photograph No.2 which depicts present pole No. 3. This lane does not carry much big traffic and, by a slight change in the position of poles 3 and 5 (future pole positions U and 7), it may be possible to bring the lines slightly' further out from the fence. This can be seen more clearly in photograph No. 3 which was taken from behind present pole 5 looking back to poles U and 3* It is proposed to place the new No. 7 pole further out from the corner in order to obtain an alignment to new pole 10, at the Mosque, clear of a big tree which overhangs close to present pole 6. It is not anticipated that any road operations will take place for some time along this portion of the route between Point , X ! and the Mosque as this is not a main road. Photograph No. 4 shews present pole 7 - the site for new pole 10 - close to the south side of the Mosque. This position does not give a bad alignment with adjacent poles to the west of it providing the trees are trimmed. The soil at the side of the road surrounding present poles 8, 9 aud 10 has been cut away in order to be used for making up the road. This has left these poles 1 isolated in their cement beds. This road is being made up all' along the route from present poles 7 to 29 and the authorities concerned have been requested to leave untouched as large an area as possible round the present poles. Another effect of these road operations is to lov/er the effective height of the new poles when erected as the earth removed from the roadside is banked up and rolled into the crown of the road. This means that if it were necessary for the new lines to cross the roads at these points, a pole height of nearly 20 feet would be essential in order to give a clearance of 16 ' above the road. It is on account of this that it is proposed to place new pole 10 in the position occupied by present pole 7. The north side of the road bordering the cemetery is clear of trees but the ground level is considerably below the new road level. If the new pole 10 could be placed on the north side of the Mosque, this would pull the line clear of trees; unfortunately, this does not seem possible as the small space between the Mosque and the main road is filled with graves right up to the edge of the road. As a pole in this position would have to be strutted, it would mean interfering with this burial ground. Photographs 3 and 6 shew the line looking east back to the Mosque.- The clear space shewn on the left of the photograph - the north side of the road - only extends to the boundary of the cemetery; from this boundary westwards the north side of the road is for the most part quite unsuitable for a route ov/ing to large trees overhanging the road. The line is in contact with trees between present poles 17, 18 and 19. This can be seen in photograph No. 7. The stone close to pole 17 marks the edge of a cement culvert under the road. The same alignment will have to be followed here although it may be possible to set the new poles slightly further out towards the road. This portion of the road has not yet been made up. There are further contacts between present poles 20 and 23« The line between poles 20 and 21 passes over the top of the remains of a Mosque. It is understood that all such obstacles will not^be touched when the road is made up. Photographs 8 and 9 shew / i° P° r lon of the route. The line clears the Mosque by 6* and by ^ trees ‘ on th e western side of the Mosque. It will possible Ph ? t0S r aph No 9 that no chan S e alignment is possible here owing t° the trees on the right (north side). to pole 20. !f new ^ie No ^ presen l t P° le 21 looking east back marked with a red cr 0 's on” tv, 2 'N! placed at the P*® position trees. This, however° would ^ean f^Tf “ W0Uld clear the a dou1:) le crossing of the road- 3 - n as a short distance further west, the northern side of the road is , inmossihle as a route owing to overhanging trees. Until this nart of the road has been made up it is not possible to say what pole height would be required to give the necessary 16 * clearance. It is probably safer to follow the present alignment and have the contacting branches trimmed. Photograph No. 11 shews present pole 22 looking east and shews the gradual bend in the road between poles 21 and 23 . Pole 21 can be seen with its* strut across the narrow ditch. Photographs 12, 13 and 14 shew where the lines pass over a Mosque at present pole 24. This Mosque is 12 feet high and to give adequate clearance the State Engineer substituted a pole of approximately 17* above ground. New pole 37 will take the place of'present pole 24 and, as the spans will be shorter, poles with 16’ clearance should be satisfactory. Photographs shew that it is not possible to cross the road here in ofder to avoid passing over the Mosque. Prom the Mosque to present poles 28 and 29, the alignment cannot be improved upon but some tree trimming is essential. Photograph 15 shews poles 28 and 29. Pole 29 was added some twelve months ago in order to raise the height of the span, which crosses the road at this point, at an angle of 32 degrees, into the lane leading to the Cable House. One of the Oil Company^ lorries carried away the line at this position - hence the extra pole. A further interruption occurred at this point caused by the owner of the land on the north side felling a tree across the road. Photograph 1 6 shews the route v/here the line leaves the main road and enters the Cable House lane - Present pole 30 is seen in the foreground. 'Hie line passes through trees. It is proposed to. place new pole 44 on the south side of the entrance to the lane and to run the new line along the opposite (eastern) side of the lane. There is perhaps some risk of tall palms falling or being felled across the lane but this change of alignment would clear the line of contacts. Photograph 17 shews this portion of the route looking south from the Cable House end of the lane. The termination of the line and. Cable House are depicted on photographs 1 8, 19 and 20. Photograph 21 shews the Cable House from the North East side. The photographs enclosed have a brief description on the backs and, if xk studied with reference to the pole positions marked on the plan, may help to illustrate that no drastic alterations are possible to the present alignment. As the new line v/ill probably be somewhat higher than the present one, and in some cases will follow the exact route, its* erection without interfering with normal working will call for some ingenuity. We have thought of one or two ways of overcoming this difficulty. As the new poles are erected, the existing line, where necessary, could perhaps be secured temporarily to the new poles. The situation could be relieved somev/hat by taking away the earth wire first and working the cable circuit on local earth for the time being - provided this does not introduce too much interference with the Aden receiving circuit. The tension of the present spans badly needs adjusting but, in view of the corroded state of the wires, it is best to leave them alone. Some of the stays are merely pieces of wire twisted together with no means of adjustment; only a few of the stays are adjustable and some of these have been put up since the line was erected when we have requested the State Engineer to replace broken poles. In general, the whole position here regarding liability, way-leaves etc., seems most haphazard. Poles have several times been knocked over by car or lorry drivers who have no scruples at all in the matter. A watch will be kept on the road operations; it is possible that slight modifications may have to be made in the proposed new pole positions. The section of the line from Point , X t to the Transmitter station - to be cut out later, is free of trees and has given comparatively little trouble. / Sd. 0. Campbell. Engineer.No* C/141-17/1 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 28th February 1939. To The Divisional Manager, Persian Gulf, Cable and Wireless Limited, K A B A C H I * Dear Sir, Will you please refer to your letter No. 9/89 dated the 14th February 1939 in regard to the aerial lines from the Bushire-Bahrain cable to the Cable House at Bahrain. 2. I went along the alignment this morning in company with the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, the Bahrain State Engineer and Messrs. Penfold and Campbell. Cur first con clusion was that it was highly desirable to continue the underground cable from the Cable Station a little further than is at nresent proposed, since the aerial line would pass along a narrow lane between two gardens from which there would be constant difficulty in future in regard to the trimming of date palms. Mr. Penfold undertook to address you on this proposal, and he will, I presume, give you full details. 3. Proceeding onwards towards the sea there will be no great difficulty in regard to erection or future maintenance^ for the distance along which the line follows the Budaiya Road. It is highly desirable however that, in order to avoid difficulty or dispute, the Company should approach the Bahrain Government to undertake the task of erection of the new posts, since they will be in the best position to arrange for entry to private property where necessary. For a con siderable part of this distance it should be easy enough for ! &gt; a/-a Government Department so to erect the poles that future interference from tree growth is practically eliminated. 41ong the remainder of this road, the line will be adjacent to one of Kis Highness' gardens which is bordered by a mesquite hedge, and it has been arranged that the hedge will be kept constantly trimmed to prevent interference with the line. 4. Along the lane connecting the Budaiya Hoad with the sea-shore I understand that it has been decided to transfer the overhead line to the other side of the lane, and our personal inspection this morning showed that with the exception of one tree, which must be cut down and for the cutting of which the Bahrain Government can arrange, there should be no difficulties either now or in the future. It is of course impossible to provide altogether against damage from date palms being blown down in high winds, but along this section old trees which might well have given rise to danger have already been felled, and damage from this cause should very seldom occur. 5. On the whole I am satisfied that, provided the under ground section is extended as suggested in paragraph 2 above, no serious difficulties should be experienced in the future, while if the Bahrain Government's -ilngineering Department undertakes erection immediate difficulties will be automatical] solved.

Lear Gibson, With regard to your letter P.2.7195/38, of the 9th February, 1939, regarding the extension of the Empire Rates Scheme to Bahrein, ~ 'uscat and Koweit, we have now received the comments of the Chairman of Cable and Wireless Limited. Mr.Wilshaw says that the application of the Scheme to the two first-named places would involve the Canpany in a loss oi over 2,000 per annum. He observes that the maintenance and operation of the strategic cables in the Persian Gulf involves great expense and this factor mahes i~ difiicult to agree to any proposal that would reduce the Company’s revenue from Persian Gulf traffic. Mr.Wilshaw also says that there are other supplementary questions in regard to the empire Scheme wnich he will have to raise at a later date, end he would preier that consideration of the extension of the Empire -ates Scheme to the Persian Gulf be deferred until it is possible to raise all these matters at one and the same t im e.

I discussed the matter with the S.N.O. who pointed out that Cable and Vireless Limited had estimated that the additional staff required to maintain a 24 hour watch for naval pur poses would cost approximately £ 2500/-. He considered that a more satisfactory arrangement could be made by establishing a small naval wireless station at the Naval Base for purposes of communication with Naval Wireless, Aden, Bombay, Colombo and sloops operating in the Persian Gulf. He asked me if I saw any objection to this scheme. I said that three main points arose which were (i) Agreement of the Bahrain Government (ii) The terms of the contract possessed by Cable and Wireless Limited (iii) Technical difficulties. As regards (i) I said that I did not anticipate would that there would be any objection and/confirm this later after consulting Adviser. As regards (ii) I said that as far as I was aware Cable and Wireless Limited did not possess a monopoly contract but that the Officer in Charge of the Bahrain Station should be consulted. As regards (iii) the Officer in Charge of Cable and Wireless Limited would also have to be consulted regarding this.

IN REPLY REFER TO No. Con/5 The Political Agent, Bahrain, v 84 Dear Sir, Further to your letter No* C/684—17/1 of the 29th* August, and our conversation on Saturday the 14th. instant, the views of the Divisional Manager, Karachi are as follows 1. In the emergency contemplated it would seem to matter little how long it would take to replace the valves as the recapture of the Island might result only from protracted military operations. 2, It seems probable, too, that any hostile action against Bahrain would be preceded by or would include aerial bombing, especially of the Wireless Stations, Even supposing the offices were not hit I do not know how the valves would stand up to the blast and concussion of 'near misses 3, To guard against total loss of valves from this cause you may care to consider the storage of one complete set of spares for one transmitter and receiver in your own house which is remote from either of the sites marked by the Wireless masts. 4, In accordance with the suggestion made by A.H.Q, India, steps should be taken to list diagrams, frequencies, stocks of spares and their location and all apparatus, alloting certain personnel to carry out the destruction; care being taken to detail more than one man for each task in case one of them should be prevented from attending to his duty, 5, It would further delay eneny use of the Wireless Stations if the masts were felled by cutting the stays, 6, If the Bahrain-Bushire cable were still in working order it is assumed that urgent communication would be maintained as long as possible by emergency apparatus from the cable house even after the des truction of the Wireless and offices. 7, All this assumes evacuation of the Island b: r all British Forces when total destruction of all telegraph apparatus and plant, including engines. Motor Generators, batteries etc., is indicated.8. It would therefore appear necessary to draw up, in consultation with the civil and naval authorities, a complete scheme of partial or total destruction to be carried out only on receipt of definite orders from them that a state of emergency has been reached which justifies the destruction of all means of communication by wireless or cable or both. 9. If there were time for evacuation to a ship it mirrht be possible to save much of the apparatus. With regard to the storage of spare valves, the felling of the masts etc., the views of Mr. Coombes, our Engineer are as followss- 1. The storage of one set of valves at the O.C’s house would present no difficulty, provided accommodation was available. A set of transmitting valves vrould number 18, and the receiving valves would be more than this, but on account of their size, would, of course, take up much less space. 2. If there was not accommodation available in the O.C’s house, the only other place would be the go down used to house the local repair gear, but this is very dirty, and there is a possibility that the valves may be damaged while being stored with the bulky objects such as are in the go down. 3. The masts could be felled as suggested, but in the case of the 200 foot mast, this operation would take some time, as it would take at least a day, and probably more, to free the bolts at the mast base. 4. I do not think it would be advisable to free these bolts now, as they are nice and tight and covered with paint, as well as a certain amount of rust on the threads. If these bolts were free and kept oiled, there is always the possibility that they may work loose. 5. Even with the bolts free, it is not certain that the mast would commence to fall straight away due to the weight of the remaining stays. 6. If it is required to fell the masts quickly,it is suggested that the stays be cut on one side, and a charge of explosive fired against the mast near the base ? but it would be necessary to obtain some expert opinion on this to see if it would be practical. 7. A further point would be that if the 70 foot masts were dropped in the normal way, they could be re-erected, as the only probable damage would be some bending and buckling. 8. The use of explosive should prevent their re-erection. 9. The engine could be fairly easily destroyed by means of a sledge hammer, and the quickest and easiest way to deal with the alternator would be to place a small charge of explosive between the field coils and against the armature, and this method would also apply to the motor generators. 10. It is doubtful if the machines at the Transmitter Station could be effectively put out of action with a sledge hammer, as the castings are very solid, and the windings and armature are inaccessible unless the machines are partially dismantled, which, of course, takes considerable time l 11. The commutators would be damaged by driving a cold chisel in5. in between the segments, but this damage could be repaired. 12. The transmitters themselves could, be best dealt with by pourinp petrol over them, and vuming. This would effectively destroy all the com ponents. 13. The Receiving Station is simpler to deal with, as the masts are easily dropped, each mast being balanced on an insulator, and if the masts are dropped across the building, their backs would break, which would prevent their re—erection. 14. The batteries could be broken, and the receivers put in a heap and burat^.while the motor generators, being smaller than those at the Trans mitter, could be broken up with a sledge hammer. Ity comments on The Divisional Managers views are:- Para 3. I am prepared to store these spares in my house. Perhaps you may consider the Naval Base a safer place. Para 4. We are drawing up a list of diagrams, frequencies, stocks of spares etc. Their location will depend upon your decision as to.where they are to be stored. The names of the men detailed for each task will also be communicated to you later. Para 5. With regard to the felling of the masts, please see the Engineers report paras 34567 and 8. Para 6. We have an emergency set whereby we could carry on communication with Bushire from the Cable House if the cable is in order. Paras 7 and 8. In our interview on Saturday you mentioned that you would see the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, and obtain his views. Perhaps when y*ou have consulted him, you will- let me know what scheme you have drawn up. Para 9. Perhaps the S N 0 P G could throw some light on this matter. In regard to paras 6 and 8 of the Engineers report, I should think that the use of explosive is the best way to deal with the masts, but we do not possess any. If it is decided to fell the masts by this means, perhaps you could arrange for the explosive, where it should be stored and who should carry out the job. I would be glad of your views as early as possible. Yours faithfully. Officer-in-Charge, Bahrain Branch.jngland.

I have had some discussion with th' Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf on the subject of the possible temporary dislo cation of the Wireless Station, I need not go into very lengthy discussion in informing you that in the special circumstances of Bahrain it is scarcely necessary to eonsider more than the removal or destruction of valves. In the event of an emergency warranting such a course you will be informed whether the valves can be removed intact or whether they should be smashed. As for your spare stock of valves, they may be retained at the Agency in a store-room next to the guard room. If you will be good enough to furnish the necessary shelves these can be erected in this store at any tire. When requiring to draw spares it will only be necessary to telephone to the Agency a few minutes in advance.

Telegram ,, S ,, ^// From Government of India, New Delhi To Bushire Repeated Khorramshahr Shiraz Bahrain Kuwait and Baluchistan (? Gr.MUT) No. 244 Dated 18th January 1941 Owing to interruption in cable routes in Persian Gulf all telegraphic traffic between India and Iraq, * and Persian littoral (except Muscat) will be sent and received by wireless until further notice and telegrams which might contain information that has a value to enemy should be sent by high grade cypher. ForeignH 0 X E G'' Censor Officer ■ijl ^ Mr* oahan of Cable and Wireless called this morning and said that he has received an enquiry from his Company as to the reasons for the drop in income on telegrams during December. He says that in looking through the accounts of Messrs, (iray Mackenzie he finds that during the month of December there was a drop from the normal figure of r-s 2000/- to Rs 780/-. I told him that it was probably due to censorship regulations which forbid transmission of information regarding shipping movements by ordinary means. This information is now transmitted through the Naval Authorities. Mr. tiahan said that this represented a heavy loss to his Company and that the Naval Authorities were presumably sending these messages free thus causing a loss to Cable and Wireless and a profit to Cray Mackenzie. He suggested that perhaps some arrange ments could be come to whereby such messages could be booked and charged for by Cable and Wireless and then passed on to the Naval Authorities for transmission or conversely they could, after being coded by the Naval Authorities, be sent to Cable and Wireless for onward transnassion. I said that I was not aware of the reason as to why a sudden drop should have occurred in December since outward messages have been censored for a long time now but that I would enquire into the matter and let him know whether anything could be done to safeguard the revenue of his Company. Will the Censor Officer please let me know as to whether there is any special reason for this drop in receipts during December and whether either of the suggestioj I of Mr. uahan can be put into practice ? l£t&lt;(■and* CABLE AND WIRELESS LIMITED (INCORPORATED IN ENGLAND) MANAMA, BAHRAIN, PERSIAN GULF. in reply refer to \\\^ £7th. January^ 1941. to. Con/8 y ' Telephone No. 50M The Political Agent, Bahrain, You v/ill recall that some days ago, I interviewed you regarding the disposal by the Navy Wireless Station here of Messrs Gray, Mackenzie’s telegrams. After my interview with you, I reported the matter to my Divisional Manager at Karachi. A copy of my letter is enclosed for your information. In reply, the Divisional Manager points out that the report of the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference, 1929, made, inter alia, the recommendation ( VII (C) ) that the Fighting Services are entitled to build a#d work cable and wireless stations for their own purposes, but not for commercial purposes. We contend- that the traffic taken by the Navy is commercial. I would be most grateful if you would kindly let me know if anything could be done to regularise the position. An early reply would be much appreciated. Yours faithfully. Of f ic er3n-Char ge , Bahrain Branch.CON/8 Cable and Wireless, Limited. Bahrain. 14th. January, 1941. The Divisional Manager, Karachi• ( Dear Sir, As the traffic receipts of Messrs Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co. Ltd., had fallen to less than half during December 1940, I approached the Manager of that firm who informed me that he had received written orders from the Political Agent to forward all messages relating to the arrivals and departures of steamers to the Naval authorities here who would dispose of these messages via their own wireless stations. I interviewed the Political Agent this morning who confirmed the order and said it was due to Censor restrictions and was beinr done at all other places. The average monthly account of Messrs Gray Mackenzie £ Co. Ltd., was Rs 150)0/- and in December it dropped to Rs 750/- approximatelv. I gave the Political Agent these figures, and he was rather surprised at the considerable drop. I made a suggestion that Gray Mackenzie forwarded their messages to us for booking and we would send them to the Naval authorities for disposal. The Political Agent said he would see the Senior Naval Officer and let me know his views later. Yours faithfully, (SD) C.Gahan Officer-in-Charge, Bahrain Branch.Wo. C/95 - 17/1 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 28th January 1941 Sir, I have the honour to forward herev/ith a copy of letter No. Con/8 dated the 27th January 1941 from the Office-in-Charge, Cable and tireless Limited, Bahrain. I should be very grateful to have your views on the matter. 2. As the question is a general one I propose after receipt of your reply to forward the papers to the Honourable the Political Resident. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant U . Political Agent, Bahrain. nior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf.20 / No.aae . Office of Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, H.M,Naval Base, Bahrain. 1st February, 1941. I have the honour to refer to your letter No.C/95 - 17/1 dated 28th January, 1941. The system of reporting particulars of movements of Merchant Vessels by Naval Authority was started in August, 1940. Since it has been challenged, commercially, I must refer the matter to the Commander^in-Chief, East Indies Station, for the organisation is in force on the whole of this and surrounding stations. 2. In anticipation of his views let me express mine. Although I am not concerned with revenues, it seems to me that the reduction referred to might be more probably due, not to the system of reporting, but to the stricter, in my view perfectly correct, interpretation of the censorship regulations recently enforced by Bahrain authority. Previously the agents of B.I. Company, in addition to passing information through Naval channels were passing it in plain language or a commercial code in what they considered to be a disguised form, but in which the movements of merchant ships were very definitely revealed. 3 # Furthermore the decision as to what constitutes ‘Commercial information* may be a matter of opinion. In my view the date and time of arrival of ships at various ports which is the only information so transmitted, can scarcely be described as commercial, observing that Admiralty has taken over control of all merchant shipping. But in connection with the recommendation (Vn(C)) of the report of the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference of 1929, I would suggest that not only is the security of our shipping passing over the seas in time of war a Naval purpose* but .the primary and ultimate object of the Royal Navy, indeed thereason for its existence.

The Political Resident considers that, in view of the 2 . changing conditions which the war is bringing about, it is preferable that the negotiation of formal concessions from the rulers of Koweit and Bahrein should be postponed until after the end of the war. lie adds, however, that such postponement is not likely to cause any difficulty in meeting your Company’s requirements either at Koweit or Bahrein, or to endanger their security of tenure. The Secretary of State agrees with the Political 3. Resident’s recommendation, and hopes that your Company will be willing not to press their suggestion in present circumstances. I am.

I prefer route (b) which is shorter and will restore direct communication between India and Bushire. 3. If Cable and Wireless are able to open a new station there would be many advantages in arranging for cable to touch at Bandar Abbas which is connected by land line with Kerman and Persian internal telegraph system. - Concurrence of Persian Governnent would presumably have to be obtained. 4. Alternatively I would suggest that possibility of mailing a diversion to Kuwait between Bushire and Fao should be considered. This would render unnecessary re*opening of land line between Kuwait and Basra and further efforts to esta lish direct wireless communication between the Cable and Wireless station at Kuwait and Iraq. This diversion would not appear to take up more cable than one from direct line past Quoin Islands to Bandar Abbas, and unless importance of Bundar Abbas is likely to increase considerably in near future I arc inclined to prefer it. * • 6.

Please see my telegram No*T/lh&amp; Llarch 14th. S* present position is that Cable &amp; Wireless at Bahrain are sending telegrams for Bushire almost exclusively by cable while Persian authorities arc using both wireless and cable. Persians are accepting ofIicial telegrams ahcres-ed to Bahrain also private telegrams from British ofliciais, but I do not yet know whether telegrams are being accented from general public cf. paragraph 1 of my telegr m referred to above. 4. Service at present is much speeuier than when messages hiud to be relayed from uscat or Basi’a. It is also cheaper at Bahrain end ;s Cable a Wireless are charging ten annas six ies per woru on Government messages sent direct to Eushire* Previously they were cht rging f oiat annas six pies from Bahrain to Muscat and ten annas six pies from j uscat to Bushire* Persians have not yet fixed rate for service from Bushire end. 5. On subject of rates Persian Government wish n 3 to charge their inland rate of 0.10 francs vide Tehran telegram No.41 January 19th and if they act/ on theory that Bahrain is p^rt of Iran will presumably charge no terminal rate. I would suggest that if the Persians insist on the above low rata we should charge a higher rate (say 0.60) at the Bahrain end to maintain our attituae regarding Bahrain’s status and to enable Cable &amp; Wireless to make up their losses aue to low rate on Persian side. It seems probable that whatever rate we charge at Bahrain Persians will not accept more than 0.10 as theirtheir share* 6. /iCcording to information available here full rate being charged at Muse t for telegrams to Persia is l*aO of which half goes to Persians and half to Cable and tireless. No terminal rate is charged by Persians. The rate of ten annas six pies ciuoted in paragraph 4 equ^ Is .90 of which .60 goes to Persians. This is for Government traffic on which Cable and Wireless allow a rebate of half their share. 7. So far as local Gulf traffic is concerned cable is much more convenient than wireless on which watch is only kept lor two periods of half hour each caily. I would suggest that cable should ordinarily be used f r all traffic wireless being reserved for use in emergency so far as we are concerned. Existing wireless schedules should however be maintained and if Persians wish to use their wireless station at Bushlre for messages from their tnd we neea not object. • KablLUiT - i// Telephone No. SOM IN reply refer to (if-/ k.-'V CABLE AND WIRELESS LIMITED (INCORPORATED IN ENGLAND.) - MANAMA, C BAHRAIN, PERSIAN GULF.

With reference to our conversation this morning, it is confirmed that the Royal Navy wish to purchase outright, for their own use in peace and war, the land agreed upon for the erection of a wireless station. 2. This is an area 600 feet square,with one side north and south, at the southern end of the golf course, about 2,000 yards due west of the flagstaff at the Royal Naval Base, Jufair. A similar area, ajoining the above ground, has been left to the north for use by the Royal Air Force to erect a wireless transmitting station, should they desire to do this. 4. . It would be appreciated if you would confirm that no rights of way or other hindrances exist, which would prevent the Royal Navy erecting a fence immediately inside the boundary and prohibiting the entry into the area of all persons not on naval duty.

Sir ^&gt;1 I have the honour to refer to letter No.12 dated 25th November, 1942, addressed to me by the Naval Officer-in- Charge on the subject of the purchase of a piece of land on the golf course by the Royal Navy. 2. The question of a site in this neighbourhood was discussed some time ago by me with you and the Naval Officer-in-Charge but the site that was then under consideration was found to be unsuitable. 3. The new site, which is a square having each side 600 feet long, not 600 square feet, is adjacent to the Jufair road slightly north of the point where the road bends towards Jufair. The land is Government property and I think it is probable that His Highness Shaikh Salman will agree to the sale. 4. Regarding the price, I suggest that it should be estimated at the same rate as the land lying on the bay between the Air Liaison Officer f s house and the Bahrain Government house now let to the Assistant Political Agent which was purchased some years ago by the Royal Air Force. I am now working out the comparative cost.- 2 - 5. On hearing from you I will request His Highness Shaikh Salman to approve the sale.

Sir , I have the honour to refer to your letter No. (2/1839 dated the 6th December, 1942, regarding the purchase of a piece of ground on the golf course by the Royal Navy. 2. His Highness Shaikh Salman has given his approval to the sale and the land can be taken over immediately. I am instructing the Superintendent of the Land Registra tion Department to arrange with the Naval authorities ' to have the land marked out. His Highness suggested that it would be desirable to leave a strip 200 feet wide between the main road and the area that is to be purchased. 3. Regarding the price: His Highness desires me to make the following suggestion. He would be willing to exchange the site on the golf course for a similar plot of ground on the shore north of the house which is leased to the2 the Political Agent, Bahrain, now occupied by the Assistant Political Agent. This land belongs to the Royal Air Force. I understand that if Ills Highness could obtain this site on the shore he would consider building another house for letting to Huropeans. In the case however of ills Highness T s suggestion not being practicable he is willing to dispose of the plot on the golf course for the price stated in my letter No.2238/33 dated the 5th December, 1942. b. 2-^ I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Adviser to the Government. cc The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf.

I should like, if such a course is not wholly impracticable, to accomnodate His Highness in this matter, and shall therefore be glad if you will kindly let me know whether the Hoyal Air Force would be prepared to surrender the plot of land in question. If it is not feasible for the Hoyal Air Force to relinquish their rights over the whole of the area in question i.e. a plot of 200 yards square, would they consider giving uo such smaller portion of the area as they are unlikely to require for their own purposes in the future so far as it can be foreseen? In the event of the latter alternative proving practicable the Bahrain Government would receive payment partly in cash and partly in land for the land now being transferred to the Navy.

Suggested rate of 120 centimes is admittedly high but this results from insistence on a fifty-fifty division of rate by Persian Government who would thus be getting 60 centimes a word without ^ yerfox^min^ any service. 2.

The discussion relates to the question raised by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf of whether Bahrain, Kuwait and Muscat could be included in such a proposed scheme and the response from Cable and Wireless Limited that it would result in considerable loss to them given the cost of maintaining and operating the strategic cables located in the Persian Gulf.Correspondence also relates to the presence of the Army and Royal Navy in Bahrain and their need for wireless services. Included are the decision by naval authorities to establish a wireless station at the Jufair [Al Jufayr] Naval base and the Royal Air Force (RAF) to establish a wireless station on Muharraq Island. Subsequent correspondence related to the unsuitability of the Royal Navy’s wireless service at Jufair and the need for a new plot of land to establish a better service. The correspondence includes negotiations relating to the potential purchase of land at Ummul Hassan and the Shaikh of Bahrain (Salmān bin Ḥamad)’s decision to offer the land for free in exchange for part of a plot of land at Qozaibia owned by the RAF.The final matter discussed in the volume is the decision taken by the Iranian Government in 1938 to cease transmitting telegrams from Iran to Bahrain and subsequent discussions and negotiations with the Iranian Government from 1941 onwards to resume the service, including the need to settle the rate charged for telegrams so that they could be shared equally by Cable and Wireless and the Iranian Government.A series of file notes which were maintained as a record of the correspondence in the volume can be found at folios 300-325.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Land Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Cable and Wireless Ltd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Naval Officer-in-Charge, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>RAF Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Cable and Wireless Ltd, Officer in Charge, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00039d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
