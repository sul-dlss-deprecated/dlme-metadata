The words to the right and left of the title also mention that this graveyard was the resting place of the ‘neighbours of God’, in other words, neighbours of the ‘House of God’, i.e. Meccans.InscriptionsRecto:Upper centre: ‘Picture of the Paradise of al-Ma'ala’To the right and left of the title:‘Friends, this is the burial place of the neighbours of God.Friends, this is the resting place of the pilgrims and the people of Mecca.How fortunate are those who have been buried here.Friends, on this cemetery is the infinite mercy [of God].’To the right and left of the image:‘This vast cemetery on the road to Mina and ‘Arafat, between two mountains adjoining the honourable city of Mecca to the north and east, contains two divisions. Its original and former name was Ma’alat. From frequency of use it became Ma’ala. The word jannat (paradise) was added later. In the parlance of the pilgrims its popular name is the “paradise of al-Ma’ala” [“the lofty paradise”]; the Meccans, however, still call it Ma’ala or Mala. This is the cemetery in which are buried hundreds of companions of the Prophet and the followers [i.e., the generations after the companions], thousands of enlightened friends of God [saints], and the beloved servants of God. The mausoleum of the Prophet’s glorious mother, the Lady Amina, may God be pleased with her, located at the boundary of this cemetery is well adorned with great splendour, carpets, and so on. The holy mausoleum of the Prophet’s first wife, the mother of Fatima, the resplendent, and the mother of believers, the Lady Khadija the Great, is also here. It is near the mausoleum of the Lady Amina, may God be pleased with her, and is decorated with various kinds of beautiful inscriptions, valuable and elegant arabesques, and lanterns. Its dome is of great splendour. In reality, nobody knows with certainty the real location of her tomb. The existing mausoleum was built by Fuzail ibn ‘Iyaz on the basis of an inspiration. This perfect man was a saint and his mausoleum is also here.’Lower centre: ‘H. A.
