The RESIDENT to the SECRETARY OF STATE (Received 22nd October, 1928.) (No. 185.) (Confidential.) SlR ’ Residency Office, Aden, 10th October, 1928.

With reference to the Imam's “ dynastic ” claims to the Protectorate, baser on a thousand years possession of Yemen, on which he is continually harping I have drawn up the attached “ Precis of the History of Yemen ” showing fairh these clams are worth.

One interesting fact (though not of immediate interest to us) which is made clear by the precis is that the Imam’s claim to about half the territory that he rules over now, i.e., the Shafai half, is no stronger than that to the Protectorate, and rests on the same insecure basis : Zaidi rule over Yemen from 1630-1728 (paragraphs 10-13 of precis). In exactly the same way as the Shafai tribes of the future Protectorate threw off the Imamic rule in 1728, so did the Shafai elements of Hujariya, Taiz, Kataba and Tiharaa between 1728-1758. Nor was Imamic sway resumed over them until the Turks evacuated Yemen in 1918. T. C. Fowle, Major, First Assistant Resident, Aden.

The Saada line, though over-shadowed by that of Sanaa, was still in existence in 1906 (see below). An Imam can be elected from any member of any branch of the Imamic family—whose name is legion. “ The internal history of the Imamate is too hetero geneously complex and lengthy to be related in this short note, but suffice it to say that on account of the non- essential condition of the observance of the law of heredity or the law of primogeniture in the election of the Imam, sometimes quite outsiders have been elected as Imams, e.ff., 1707, when Mohamed bin Hasan, a native of Shehr, was proclaimed Imam under the title of El Nasr, w’hile in the more recent history in 1862 the people of Sanaa de posed and ousted the then Imam and elected one Arab Sheikh Mohsin-bin-Moyyad as their Imam, but as he was3 not a Sayed or Sharif, they subsequently elected a religi ous Imam in the person of a Sayed Mohsin-Esh-Shara- fuddin, who took up his abode in Shahara, while the Political power remained in the hands of the non-Sayed Mohsin ibn Moyyad till the rise of Imam Ghalib in 1869.” (“ Note on the Zaida Imamate of Sanaa,” paragraph 9). The father of the present Imam—Mohamed—was merely a Sanaa Mufti (expounder of Mohammedan Law), one among many such men, when he was elected to the Imamate, and his son Yahya—the present Imam—suc ceeded him in 1904 merely by election, and as a matter of fact was opposed by a section of the Zaidis, who put forward a rival in the person of Saved Mohamed-el- Haschim-el-Dajani.

In order to lind out how far the claim of the Imam of Sanaa, that his ancestors had held Yemen for a thousand years before this time, is based on facts it is necessary for one to acquaint oneself with the history of Yemen from the rise of Islam up to the present day, so that an accurate estimate of the above statement may be made. 2. During the life-time of the Prophet of Islam and just after the era of the Hijra, i.e. } the Flight of the Prophet from Mecca to Medina, corresponding to A.D. 622, when the.Moslem conquests in Arabia began, Yemen or Southern Arabia was governed by a Persian Viceroy named Badhan.* This Viceroy, acting under instructions from his Monarch, Kisra Perwez, was about to attack Mohammed and his small number of followers in Yathrab, when he was informed by the Prophet, before the \iceroy had received any news himself, that the Persian Emperor, under whose direction he was acting, had, just then, met his deserts and had been deposed by his outraged subjects. The accuracy of this news was afterwards proved through official sources, and Badhan embraced Islam and tendered his allegiance to the Prophet, who confirmed him in his office of the Governor of Yemen, in which capacity he continued to rule till his death. 3. During the latter portion of Badhan’s government some disturbances of a more or less serious nature took place in Yemen, and Ali-ibn-Abu-Talib, the Prophet’s cousin and companion, was appointed by him to quell them. Ali not only did successfully put down the revolt, but succeeded in converting the whole tribe of Hamdan to Islam in one day and their example was soon followed by all the in habitants of Y emen, except those of Nejran who preferred to remain Christain and pay tribute. (X.B. -The present tribes of Hashids and Bekils, who claim direct descent from the original Hamadan tribe which had embraced Islam at the hands of Ali, aie still proud of this tradition, and never tire of claiming their superiority over the other tribes of Yemen, who were all later converts to Islam than thev. This event may also be the cause of the Shiite and pro-Aliite tendencies which all the in habitants of Yemen have invariably exhibited in the whole of the subsequent Islamic history of Yemen). 4- After the death of Badhan, the Prophet divided Yemen between Shehr, son of Badhan, and six of his own companions, to each of whom he assigned a province m it.^ Immediately after this event, however, the Prophet died in A.D. 632. 5. When Abu-Baker-es-Saddiq was declared Caliph, he found Yemen in the throes of a serious rebellion which, combined with the disturbances in Yemama t threatened the very existence of Islam. He, however, successfullv put down the revolt of El-Astvad-ibn-Ka’ab phool Hamar, and subsequently of Amr-ibn-Ma’dikarb and Qais ibn Abdul Yagooth in Yemen and of Asha’s ibn Qais in Hadramaut. He then divided the country between three governors, viz., Saeed-ibn-Labeed appointed to Hadramaut Ibban-ibn-Saeed appointed to Sanaa, while Jannad was allotted to Ma ad-ibn-Jabl-el-Ausan. Ibban-ibn-Saeed appears to have died or have been removed soon after and another person named Jalea ibn Omavva sent in his stead These Governors were subsequently confirmed in their posts by the Caliphs Omar and Othman m A.D. 634 and 643 respectively. 6 When, however. Ali-ibn-Abi-Talib succeeded to the Caliphate in A.D. 655 acute dissensions broke out between the two main divisions of the Koraishites, viz., the Hashamities to whom Ah belonged, and the Ommavyads to whom the late Caliph othman and his chief advisers belonged, on account of the rather untactful action ot the new Caliph in dismissing at once all the governors appointed bv the former Caliphs. All the provinces of the then Moslem Empire refused to recognise the new governors, except Yemen, where the Aliite governor Abdullah-ibn-Abbas-el- Ansari succeeded, after some trouble, in establishing his Government, though of course it was practicaUy of no great advantage, as the former Governor Jalea ibn Omavva had carried off all the Government Treasury with him. 7. In the subsequent Aleo-Muawiyya struggle for Islamic Caliphate during the next few years, Yemen shared the fortunes of Ali, and although the Aliite Governor of that province, Abdullah-ibn-Abbas-el-Ansari, put in a bold and severe fidit against the Ommayyad Genera! Bashir-ibn-Arteb who had invaded Yemen under instructions from his chief, his force was utterly routed and the whole province was cruelly and direly punished for its adherence and faithfulness to Ali P Playfair ” History of Yemen, founded on the accounts of Masoodi in his book ' Meadows of (rold and Mines of Gems.” t The country on the east of Hijaz and Asir is generally spoken of as Yemama in the old Arabian History.S. Ali-ibn-Abi-Talib died about the year A.D. 661, and in the same year Hassan, his eldest son, abdicated the Caliphate throne in favour of Muawiyya. Thus Yemen finally became subject to the Caliphs of the house of Muawiyya, and remained so until A.D. 749, when that dynasty was overpowered and extinguished by the Abbasides. 9. From A.D. 750 to 905 the Abbasides ruled Yemen by means of their Viceroys directly appointed by the Court of Baghdad, and until it passed into the sanguinary and sacrilegious hands of the Qaramities. 10. In the year A.D. 996 the Court of Baghdad learned for the first time that the Qaramities had gained almost all Yemen and were threatening Mecca and Medina.* From that time till the year A.D. 985, when the Qaramities sustained a crushing defeat m Iraq, the history of Yemen shows an endless series of most outrageous, cruel and shockingly sacrilegious acts on the part of the Qaramite governors of Yemen, anti numerous other inter-tribal strifes and quarrels. Abu Tahir, the famous Qaramite General, who reigned in Mecca and Omman and Bahrein,! and his creature, Ali ibn Fadl, who reigned in Yemen for a long time, professed to owe allegiance to the Fatimite Caliph Almahdi Obeidullah whose capital at that period was in Kairowan, but subsequently, during the Fatimite period in Egypt, there does not seem to have been much love lost between the Fatimites and Qaramities. Although Alomizz, the first Fatimite Caliph in Egypt, immediately after his arrival in Alexandria on the 31st May, A.D. 973, proceeded to instruct his new subjects in the same doctrines of bhiite creed, which were identical with those professed by Qaramathians, hoping thus to gain the good will and submission of the votaries of that sect; his plan proved entirely unsuccessful and these heretics continued to harass the Fatimites as well as the Abbasides for a long time. 11. The sacrilegious atrocities committed by the Qaramathians have been un paralleled in the history of Islam since its inception. The peculiar doctrines that they preached and the most terrible havoc that they wrought in the holy places of Islam have been described so cogently and explicitly by Gibbon in his immortal work “ The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,” that I cannot resist the temptation of quoting him at some length, for which I crave indulgence. He sayst “ In the 275th year of the Hijra and in the neighbourhood of Cufa, an Arabian preacher of the name of Caramath assumed the lofty and incomprehensible stvle of the guide, the director, the demonstration, the word, the Holy Ghost, the camel, the herald’of Messiah, who had conversed with him in a human shape and the representative of Mohammed § the son of Ali, of St. John the Baptist, || and the Angel Gabriel. In his mystic volume the precepts of the Quran were refined to a more spiritual sense, he released the duties of ablutions, fasting and pilgrimage, allowed the indiscriminate use of wine and forbidden fruit, and nourished the fervour of his disciples by the dailv repetition of o0 prayers Instead of the legal tithes, he claimed the fifth of his followers substance and spoil; the most flagitious sins were no more than a type of disobedience; and brethren were united and concealed by an oath of secrecy . . The rapine of the Caramathians was sanctified by their aversion to the worship of Mecca; they robbed a caravan of pilgrims and twentv thousand devout Moslems were abandoned on the burning sands to a death of hunger and thirst.

Zahereyali, whom Playfair on the authority of Al-Khuzraji mentions in his book to have conquered Aden in A.D. 1U38 and then appointed Solaihi as its Governor, appears to have been one of the Bedouin Sheikhs in whose hands the Qaramite Government in Yemen had fallen. 15. *ln A.D. 1050 Ali bin Mohammed-el-Sulaihi appears to have conquered the whole of Yemen (and according to some historians even Mecca and lladramaut), and tendered his allegiance to the then Fatimite Caliph of Egypt, Almostansir billa. 16. From this date onward, till the installation of the Ayyubide dynasty on the throne of Egvpt in A.D. 1173, Yemen continued to recognize the Caliphate of Fatimite Caliplis of Egypt, though of course throughout the whole of this period local quarrels between the scions of the various governing families were never at rest—those between! Saba and Ali, the sons of Masood and Abdul Kadir, the des cendants of Solaihi and his rival Dhool-Ka, are the most noteworthy and are recorded in detail in the chronicles of A1 Khazraji and Omarah. 17. In A.D. 1173, when the Ayyubide dynasty supplanted the Fatimite Caliphs of Egypt, the then Sultan of Sanaa resigned his authority in the hands of Tooranshah, the brother of Salah-Ed-Din-el-Ayyubi (better known in the European History as Saladin of the crusades), who had first acted at the prefecture of Egypt as a deputy of Sultan Nurud din Zangi, but subsequently on the decease of the last of the Fatimite Caliphs, had assumed the title of Sultan of Egypt on the 12th of April A.D. 1174. 18. It appears from the accounts of Ali-bin-Hasan-El-Khazraji given in his history “ Uqudul Luluyya ” edited by Sheikh Mohammed Asal and published in Arabic by E. J. W. Gibb Memorial Committee in 1913, that the Ayyubide dynasty reigned in Yemen till A.D. 1248, when their last Sultan in Yemen, El-Malek-El-Masood, left for Mecca on his way to Egypt, where he was called by his cousin the Sultan-El- Malek-El-Kamil for being appointed to the Governorship of Damascus which had just then fallen vacant by the death of El-Malek-el-Adil-bin-Ayyub. 19. El-Malek-El-Masood of Yemen before his departure from Sanaa had appointed his Atabak, i.e., the Oommander-in-Chief of his Forces, Nuruddin-Umar- bin-Ali-bin-Rasool, as his Viceroy in Yemen. 20. El-Malek-el-Masood died in Mecca on his way to Egypt in A.D. 1248, but his Viceroy continued to govern the whole of Yemen in his name till A.D. 1252, when he declared his independence of the Ayyubide dynasty of Egypt. He struck the coins in his own name, substituted his name in the Khutba prayers in place of the name of the Sultan of Egypt, and thus laid the foundation of the famous Rasulite Dynasty of Yemen, which reigned without intermission, both in the Tihama and the hills of Yemen, with its highland capitals at Sanaa and Taiz and lowland capital at Zabid, from A.D. 1252 to 1539, when the whole of Arabia passed into the hands of the Turkish Sultan Sulaiman the Magnificient, who in the latter year not only occupied the whole of the coast of Yemen but the hills as well, and Sanaa became the seat of a Turkish Pashalik. 21. From A.D. 1539 to 1630 the Turks reigned in Yemen continuously, though of course, during the period the Arabs unsuccessfully revolted several times against the oppression and corruption of their Turkish masters. These revolts whenever they occurred were put down with great severity and carnages. 22. The cause of the evacuation of Yemen by the Turks at this time is said to have been the general revulsion of the Arab feelings against them on account of the extreme corruption and great cruelty in their administration and the abysmal depths of degradation to which their morals had sunk. It is said bv Sheikh Saleh-el-Mughbali, a great preacher of that period, that the vice of sodomy had become so rampant amongst the Turkish soldiers and civilians at that time, that the people were compelled to screen their boys to the same extent as they screened their girls. 23. The effect of this general corruption of the Turks in Yemen was that when one Kassim, a resident of Zohra in the vicinity of Loheiya and a descendant of the house of Sharif Barakat, whose son Mohammed, the then Sharif of Mecca, had invaded Yemen during the Rasulite period, all the Arab chiefs in the hills, as well as the Tihama, rallied round him and commenced a series of attacks on their masters, whom they ultimately drove out of all the Yemen. 24. Subsequently, Kassim, who had by this time assumed the title of Sayyed (and was given the posthumous surname of A1 Kabir, i.e., the Great) governed the whole of Yemen for a few years before his death. After his death, his son Ismail invested himself with the appellation of El-Mutwakkil-al-allah and proclaimed himself Imam, * Eney. Britt. “ Eyypt ” Omarah’s “ History of Yemen.” t Playfair History of Yemen on the authority of Imam Ali ibn Husain El Khazraji.7 in supersession of the Zaidi Imams of Sada, whose family was thus finally extinguished, and made Sanaa his capital. 25. From A.D. 1630 onwards these new Imams continued in sway of the whole of Yemen until 1728, when one Ahmed, a brother of the then Imam, declared himself independent in Taiz. Subsequently, in 1758, one Sheikh Abdul Rub declared himself independent chief of Hujairia and Kataba, while 2 years afterwards the principality of Abu Arish also became independent of the sovereign of Yemen. 26. *The Sharifs of Abu Arish. from A.D. 1760 forward continued extending their rule in the Tihama, until the whole of the coast of Yemen from Kunhda to Bait el Fakih was occupied by them by about A.D. 1790. Thus, when Abu Nookta, the Chief of Asir, with his Wahabi hordes, attacked Yemen, Sharif Hamood of Abu Arish was ruling the whole of Tihama up to Bait el Fakih. 27. From 1805 to 1815 Yemen was a scene of frequent invasions from the Assiris and the Wahabites of Nejd, in consequence of which Sharif Hamood was com pelled to change sides on various occasions, according to circumstances. He is seen, sometimes negotiating with the Imam of Sanaa, at others with the Assiris and the Wahabites, and at times even with Mohamed Ali Pasha and his son Ibrahim Pasha, who had beeen appointed by the Porte for the punishment of the Wahabites, whose power was absolutely shattered by them, first in 1815 and then finally broken in 1818. 28. At the time that the siege of Deria, the Wahabi stronghold, was protracted in the summer of 1818, Ibrahim Pasha had sent to Egypt for further reinforcements. These reinforcements to the number of 2,500 men under the command of Khalil Pasha did not arrive until Deria had fallen. Consequently, they were not required for any further use, but Mohammed Ali Pasha ordered them to be employed against the Sharif of Abu Arish, who was now governing nearly the whole of Tihama, and a part of the other provinces of Yemen as well as Kunfida, Loheiya, and several other coastal towns fell into the hands of Mohammed Pasha, who subsequently arranged to hand them over to the Imam of Sanaa under a compact that the latter should remit to the Turkish Viceroy of Egypt annually the sum of one lakh of dollars. 29. But soon after this compact not only the Sharifs of Abu Arish regained possession of all the provinces wrested from them by Mohammed Ali Pasha, but the Imam lost a large portion of his other dominions, including Taiz, Jiblah and Es-Shimlah, which were seized by the Dhoo Mohamed and Dhoo Husain tribes. Mokha, however, still remained in the Imamic possession. 30. During the year 1831, when the Turkish Viceroy of Egypt, Mohammed Ali Pasha, revolted against the Sultan of Turkey and invaded Syria, his army in the Hedjaz mutinied, and a section of it under a Turkish officer, Turkchi Bilrnas, started on an ambitious career of the conquest of the Yemen coast, which, according to the compact of 1816 mentioned above was considered to be nominally under the suzerainty of the Viceroy of Egypt at that time. He entered Mokha in the year 1832 but had to surrender it, next year, to the Assiri invader Ali Ibn Meythel, who in his turn was obliged to restore it to the authority of the Egyptian Viceroy, whose armv under Ibrahim Pasha ultimately succeeded in reducing all the Tihama in 1833. 31. Early in the year 1840, however, the Egyptian troops evacuated Yemen, chiefly under the influence of the vigorous intervention of the European powers in the struggle between Mohammed Ali Pasha and the Porte at the end of the Svrian campaign of 1839. 32. tlmmediately after this evacuation Sharif Husain of Abu Arish reoccupied all the Tihama up to Mokha and our treaty with him dated the 1st of September, 1840 shows that he was in effective occupation of the country and its principal port in 1840 He even succeeded in wresting Taiz from the Imam in 1844 and Tbb and Jiblah in 1845. In 1843 he had already been given the title of Pasha bv the Sultan of Turkey whose name was now mentioned in the Khutba of Juma prayers, and formally invested with the Government of Tihama on the condition that he should pay 70.000 dollars annually to the Imperial Ottoman Treasury. The struggles between the Imam of Sanaa and the Sharif of Abu Arish for the possession of Tihama which occurred between A.D 1840 and 1849 are too numerous to be related here, but the nett result of these desultory fights was that the Sharif, in spite of occasional reverses, continued to reign supreme in Tihama till the final occupation of it bv the Turks in April, 1849 * The following accounts are based on “ Nafeh el Ud,” a manuscript history of Sharif Hamood, by Ahmed ibn el Hassan, El Bahkali and Playfair’s “ History of Yemen.” + The following accounts are founded on the manuscript history named “ Dhahb el Matbuk ” by Ahmed bin Zaid and Playfair “ History of Yemen.”'63. The Sharifian rule in the whole of Tihama generally, and Mokha particularly, had made itself disgusting to the people, by its cruelty and oppression, while the incessant warfare and unending quarrels between the Imam and the Sharif had reduced the country to such a condition of chaos and insecurity of life and property that the Turkish Government finally resolved to take possession of Yemen, and sent Taufik Pasha with a fleet from Jeddah to occupy all the ports of Yemen. Sharif Husain surrendered the whole of the country under him to Taufik Pasha in A.D. 1849 without demur and retired to Abu Arish on a substantial pension which was continued to his progeny for two generations. 34. *Soon after his arrival in Abu Arish Sharif Husain in company with Sharif Mohammed Own of Mecca set out for Constantinople to pay his respects to the Sultan. On his arrival in Constantinople he was received by the then Sultan with great honour and was granted an addition of 5,000 piasters (LT50) p.m. in his pension. He re turned to Mecca the same year and died there after two years. The chief surviving members of Sharif Husain’s family at present are :— 1. Sharif Mohamed-bin-Zaid-ibn-el-Husain, the Idrissian Amil of Zaidiya and the Chief in Command of the Tdrissian forces in Malhan. 2. Sharif Ahmed-bin-Zaid-ibn-el-Husain, the Idrissian Amil of Hodeidah. 3. Sharif Hamood-bin-ibn-el-Husain, the Idrissian Amil of Midi. Since 1849 the Turks have remained in occupation of Yemen, till their recent evacuation in 1919 as a result of the great European war of 1914-1918 1922. M. Fazlud-dtn, Captain, I.M.S. Enclosure 3. A Note on the Zaidi Imamate of Sanaa, by Captain M. Fazluddin, I.M.S., Political Officer, Hodeidah. The religion of Islam is divided into two main divisions—Sunnism and Shiaism)— which differ from each other not so much in their fundamental beliefs in the principal tenets of Islam, as in certain historical traditions, viz., the succession of the Caliphs or the successors of the Prophet and a few miner religious practices. These sects are further subdivided into numerous divisions and their subdivisions according to the expositions of the various exponents of the Islamic law and Islamic Metaphysics or Mystic Philosophy. 2. The chief divisions of Sunnism according to the different interpretations of the Moslem Quranic law and the traditions of the Prophet are :— (1) The Hanafites—the followers of Imam Abu Hanifa (Moslems of India, Afghanistan, Turkey, Turkistan and Baluchistan, mostly conform to these schools). (2) The Shafiites, the followers of Imam Ahamed-esh-Shafai (Moslems of Arabia, Syria and Egypt mostly conform to this school). 3. The Malekites—the followers of Imam Mohamed ibn Malek (Moslems of Sudan, all the countries of North Africa and parts of Somaliland belong to this school). (4) The Hanabalites, the followers of Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal (Moslems of Central Arabia and the eastern coast of Arabia mostly conform to this school). The Wahabites of Nejd are an advanced puritanical form of the last school. 3. The main divisions of Shiaism, based on a similar basis of divisions to that of Sunnites and on dilterences of Apostolic succession of imams, the descendants of Ali are:— (1) The Zaidies—the followers of Imam Zaid-ibn-Zain-el-Abidin-ibn-Husain- ibn-Ali. (This school is confined to the Highlands of Yemen only.) (2) The Motazalites—the followers of Mahmood-el-Zamakhshri (parts of Persia, Syria and India conform to this school). This school is also known as the Rationalistic sect of Islam and the more enlightened and highly educated amongst the Moslems in all ages, since its first initiation at the time of the Abbaside Caliph Mamen, who himself was a great partisan of this school, have belonged to this school. * Local information gathered from the great-grand-sons of Sharif Husain.*# * # 9 Of the above divisions of Shiaism the Zaidies are the nearest approach to the Sunnism both in their religious law and hstorical traditions. Among other things they teach that a Caliph or successor of the Prophet both temporally as well as spiritually should be a descendant of the Prophet through his daughter Fatima and her husband Ali, but if circumstances render it necessary that a Caliph is chosen who is not a descendant of the Prophet, then the Moslems should elect an Imam or a Religious Leader, to whom they should accord religious obedience, apart from the Caliph to whom obedience in temporal matters is necessary. 4. *The Zaidi Imamate in Yemen began about the year A.P. 885, and from that date up to the present the whole period of this Imamate can be divided into two distinct periods. The first period extends from the year A.D. 902 to A.D. 1630, and the second extends from A.D. 1630 up to date. The first period of the Zaidi Imamate in Yemen. 5. It dates from the year A.H. 280, corresponding to about A.D. 885, when a person named ^ ahia-ibn-el-Husain-al-Kassim-Ar-Rassi, who claimed descent from the Prophet through his grandson Hasan-ibn-Ali, having migrated from ‘Iraq, along with his father at the time of Abbaside Caliph al Mutadid, reached first Shurfa, subsequently Yemen and took up his abode as teacher in Sada. He adopted the profession of a teacher and taught his pupils the doctrines and law of Islam as expounded by Imam- Zaid-Zain-el-Abdin-bin-Husain-bin-Ali and preached to them that only he deserves to be elected the Imam or Leader of Moslems, who should be descendant of the Prophet, should be thoroughly learned in the lore of religion, and should be pious and God fearing, brave and intrepid in war, just in administration and liberal and munificent in his dealings with the people. The effect of this teaching was that the small number of his pupils and followers in the doctrines of Zaidism, to whom he impressed as the paragon of perfection, and the model of all the qualities for being an Imam, as enunciated by himself, elected him as their Imam in Sada in the same year as he had arrived at that place. He at first exercised only religious authority over his followers in Sada and its vicinity, but subsequently assumed the political and adminis trative control of those parts as well. 6. Although, according to the Zaidi conditions for the election of an Imam, the observance of law of heredity, except in as far as the candidate should be a descendant of the Prophet, is not necessary, the Imamate at Sada continued in the family of the hist Imam Mohammed-el-Hadi-Yahya-ibn-el-Husain till A.D. 1630. During this period the authority of the Imams had been exercised mainly in the district of Sada and its environments, but it appears to have once extended to Nejran, Yaffa, up to Dahir in A.D. 1152, at the time of Imam Ahmed-ibn-El-Mutawakil-al-allah, but they never succeeded in taking Sanaa which was governed successively by the Governors of the Ommayyads, the Abbasides, the Fatimites, the Auyyubides and the Rasulites. 7. In A.D. 1630, however, a man named Kassim, Resident of Zohra near Loheiya, who traced his lineage to Sharif Mohammed-ibn-Barakat, a Sharif of Mecca who had invaded Yemen in 1477, raised the standard of revolt against the Turkish Rule in Yemen and by the aid of the Arab Chiefs both in the Highlands and Tihama, succeeded in expelling them out of the whole of this part of Arabia. Subsequently he assumed the title of Sayyed and was invested with the appellation of El-Kabir after his death, when his eldest son Ismail proclaimed himself the Imam of Yemen under the title of Al-Mutawakkil-al-Ullah in supersession of the original Imams of Sada whose Imamate was thus finally extinguished. Thus the Imam Ismail-al-Mutawwakil-al-Ullah became the first Imam of the second period of the Zaidi Imamate of Yemen. 8. The successors of this Imam ruled the whole of Yemen, both in the Highlands and in the Tihama, throughout the 17th century, though of course with varying decrees of success and frequent vicissitudes of fortune, as their authority was not infrequently challenged by local Chiefs and tribes of whom the Hashid and Bekils rising of A.D. 1677 is well-known in the history of that period. But in the 18th century they appear to have lost control of the whole of the Tihama which became dependent on the Sharifian family of Abu Arish, a brief account of which has alreadv been given in the previous * The following accounts are mainly based on the authority of Omarah’s “ History of Yemen ” and Playfair “ History of Yemen.”note on the history of Yemen, till finally in the middle of the l ( Jth century the Ottoman Government occupied Yemen—the coast as well as the Highlands. 9. The internal history of the Imamate is too heterogeneously complex and lengthy to be related in this short note, but suffice it to say that on account of the non-essential condition of the observance of the law of heredity or the law of primogeniture in the election of the Imam, sometimes quite outsiders have been elected as Imams, e.g., in 1707, when Mahomed bin Hasa, a native of Shehr, was proclaimed Imam under the title of El Nasr, while in the more recent history in 1802 the people of Sanaa deposed and ousted the then Imam and elected one Arab Sheikh Mohsin-bin- Moyyad as their Imam, but as he was not a Sayed or Sharif, they, subsequently, elected a religious Imam in the person of a Sayed Mohsin-Esh-Sharafuddin who took took up his abode in Shahara, while the Political power remained in the hands of the non-Sayed Mohsin-ibn-Moyvad till the rise of Imam Ghalib in 1869 . 10. The present Imam’s father, Mohamed-ibn-Hamiduddin, though originally a descendant of the house of Es-Sayed-Kassim-El-Kabir or a branch of his family, none of the scions of which had ever before been elected Imam, was merely a mufti in Sanaa like so many other mufties besides him. Through the good offices of Imam Sharafuddin his influence was increased among the people and on his death Mohamed Hamid-uddin was unanimously elected as Imam. But the election of the present Imam Yahva-ibn- Mohamed Hamid-uddin after the death of his father in A.D. 1900, was actually chal lenged by a large section of Zaidis who elected another Imam named Addahvani who is still alive, and if any favourable opportunity arises will not be slow in contesting the Tmamate to the bitter end.
