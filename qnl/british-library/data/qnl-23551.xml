If a boat b$ damaged no claim will be against the steamer and I would suggest that Captains take what action they consider necessary to cut any such boat adrift from the steamer. The warning having been issued no responsibility would rest on the Captain/ for taking such action to protect his ship and I think, if this were dene, once or twice, the annoyance would o.as..

Please find attached the Ship’s Surgeon Death Certificate Trusting the above has your approval. I have the honor to remain,Reference the attached letter NoJ3L/l4-l from Mr. Russell. I presume by accidents 'grounding' of vessels is meant. From the Mote of Protests recorded in this Agency only two accidents have occurred since 1924 viz s.s. Khuzistan on 3-12-1924 and s.s. Barenfels on 20-10-1929 In addition to the above the I.E.T.S.

I take It by ’accidents to steamers' you mean groundings and oi these we have had in the past few years so far as ray records show the following: (1), Ike hhusiskm m December..1924-. (3). ike Palkenfeis at some dele in 1935. (3) . fhe Patrick Stewart on the 14th March 1937. (4) . The Barenfeis on the 30th October 1929. (5) . The John Lambert on the 24th July 1930. Those were- all groundings for various periods the longest being that of the Barenfels which was aground for nearly a fortnight and which ras obliged to lighter some 2000 tons before it could get off the Fasht Adb&amp;l. The only accident of which I have a record was a collision on the 12th August 1939 between the Bandra and a local dhow some 12. w miles from Bahrain* I cannot guarantee that these figures are exhaustive c»s we have not maintained statistics regarding these groundings but there have been ianumerable close «havea, one^the German steamer since your arrival and many instance of B.I steamers^ In fact most of the Captains have told ih that at one time or tlje other tlh'v have nearly come i to c^riof entering Bahrain end increases tdeir dislike of the Port for this. bout 3 or 4 years ago a Ilansa line steamer nearly went ashore at Hadd behind Muharraq but fortunately thereIINCORPORATING &gt; STEPHEN LYNCH 8.

Shortly after *Baroda* had started from Bahrain (on the night of my departure) a 'jolly hoat' in full sail and and without any vestige of a light on board suddenly came into view when she was within a few yards of the port side of the ship. Although the night was clear it was pitch daric and only the lights aboard the mail revealed the jolly-boat's presence. Apparently the crew were all fast asleep as she was coming on to us full sail, and it w a s not until the 'Baroda' gave a blast on her syren that they *oke up. Had they been awake they could have veered round in the 20 yards or so they had to spare. The sounding of the syren raised pandemonium on board the jolly-boat, w h o crashed, bowsprit on, into 'Baroda'. Captain Sampson meanwhile had stopped his engines and gone full astern. After the crash,the jolly-boat scraped down the ship's side and tore a slight hole in her sail on the (hoisted) gangway. She thereafter made off 'ith ^ all available speed inspite of shouts to the crew to come alongside. Sampson circled round to ensure that all w as w e ll and that the jolly boat w as not making water. She refused to give either name or number. In reply to shouted enquiries she replied that she w as •quite all right and had merely broken a bit off her bowsprit'2 ' o 11 * ^ \ '•&gt; | Her anxiety to get a w ay seemed to afford further evidence of the jolly-hoat 1 s culplhility and all the many Arabs on board the mail w e re unanimous in saying that the fault was entirely tha^^cnf hers and not that of the mail* I recorded the statement on oath of one of them in case of eventuali ties* Sampson throughout showed consummate skill and seamanship in handling his ship* He has of course re ported to his company* i '1■I I '—I 0,No .1501,dated 29-11-1933,from l&amp;aj or Bremiidr .Muscat.
