His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrein arrived at Aden in S.S. STRATHAIRD at 1200 Wednesday 19th January. He was received by representatives of the Acting Governor and Commander in Chief and Commander M. Henstock, Royal Navy, Naval Officer-in-Charge, Aden, in the absence on the sick list of His Excellency. Accompanied by the Naval- Officer-in-Charge, His Highness embarked in H.M.S. LONDONDERRY being received by a Petty Officers Guard. As soon as all stores had been purchased, LONDONDERRY sailed for Jedda at 1630. 9. Fine weather with light to moderate winds was experienced during the passage. His Highness was most considerate and grateful for anything which was done for the comfort of himself and his party, ielegrams to various personages were sent by him but it was impracticable to get in touch with S.S. ISLAMI in which ship it is understood the ladies of the party were travelling, until after our arrival at Jedda. He did not remain in his cabin and, ii&gt;4pite of his age and slight difficulty in negotiating steep ladders, he visited his staff frequently on the sweep deck and every evening, for at least two hours. feck quoits were played by the party who also joined in 'the tombola” organised for the ship’s company. 10. A flag of Bahrein had not been included in the luggage of the party but a flag, which was approved by His Highness, was made onboard using a red flag with strips of white bunting. The flag was required for saluting on arrival at Jedda. H./11. The extra work in the ship fell mostly on the shoulders of the cook and officer’s steward ratings: this was most efficient-i ly carried out especially by Officers Steward 1st class Francesco Abela, Maltese N.G.S. E/L.14932, Officers Cook 1st class yr\ John Borg, Maltese N.G.S. E/L.x.20113 and Leading Cook William C. Warne, D/Mx.50513 (ship’s cook). Most Maltese ratings are able to converse in Arabic and are therefore peculiarly suitable for attendance on Arab personnages. 12. Owing to heavy layers of cloud experienced both on the evening of 21st and morning of 22nd, observations by stars were not practicable. It was therefore decided not to approach the coast until the position of the ship was accurately determined ? with a consequent delay of approximately two hours in the programmejC 13. At 1130, 22nd January, during the approach to Jedda, an escort of six aeroplanes of the Saudi Arabian Air Force met the ship and escorted her into harbour, performing low flying evolutions around the ship. H 14. At 1218, LONDONDERRY moored in the Inner Harbour, dressing ship overall and firing a salute of 21 guns. 15. His Majesty’s Minister, Sir Reader Bullard, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., boarded the ship on arrival, followed by His Royal Highness, The Amir Feisal, Viceroy of the Hedjaz, who was received by an officers guard and a salute of 21 guns. After being welcomed by His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrein, coffee was taken in the Commanding Officer’s cabin while an address of welcome was read and the plans for the visit to His Majesty The King of Saudi Arabia were discussed. Both His Royal Highness The Viceroy of the Hedjaz and His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrein left the ship together being saluted by an officers guard and salutes of 21 guns and 11 guns respectively.

British Legation, Jedda, February 22nd., 1938. Sir, It was believed, at the time when my despatch No. 24 of February 3rd. was written, that His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain would return to the Persian Gulf fcy land. Indeed, he had accepted the offer of Ibn Saud to send him by that route. In the end, however, he decided to go to Karachi by sea from Jedda. The reason which he gave me was that to transport so large a party across Arabia would have thrown an intolerable burden upon the transport of his generous host, and indeed, the conveyance of about twenty visitors with some seventy followers to Ujair by land v/ould have required a large number of motor vehicles, and at the height of the pilgrim season. 2. It would have been more convenient if the Saudi authorities had made up their mrnds about the change of plan a little earlier, but in the end all went well. With the help of the Jedda agents of the Turner Morrison Line it was arranged that the s.s. ’'Islami”, the largest and best of the Indian pilgrim ships, should sail first after the Haj.j and should take His Highness and his party, as well as the eleven motor cars which His Highness had received as presents in the course of/ The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., ‘k 0 *’ &amp;c., &amp;c.of his visit. Another present consisted of 40 rifles and 4,000 rounds of ammunition. To ensure that there should he no difficulty about these weapons I telegraphed to the authorities at Karachi as well as to the Political Agent at Bahrain. 3. His Highness came down from Mecca on February 16th. and left the following day. Everything had already been done about the loading of the cars etc., and there remained nothing to do but to supply a considerable number of Emergency Passes for members of the suite who had lost their papers and to furnish at the last moment a certificate for several men who had not been counted before. I went on board the 'Islami' at the last moment and found the Shaikh comfortable and content. He had I think enjoyed his stay till the last, though he seemed a little tired. 4. The Amir Saud, who came to Jedda with the Shaikh, spoke of him to me with high appreciation. As a rule, he said, the Persian Gulf amirs were rather Boeotian; but not so the Shaikh of Bahrain. His remark may be compared with the statement which he is alleged to have made to the Shaikh when he was in Bahrain.

His Highness was conveyed from Aden to Jedda in H.M. S. 'Londonderry*'.

CONFIDENTIAL. [E 977/30/91] Si?' R. Bullard to Mr. Eden.—(Received February 21.) (No. 24.) Sir, Jedda, February 3, 1938. I HAVE the honour to report on the visit of His Highness the Sheikh of Bahrein, to which your telegram No. 2 of the 6th January refers. 2. Shortly beforehand Ibn Saud mentioned the visit to me with obvious pleasure. He said what a good man the sheikh was, and reminded me that he and the sheikh were both of Anayza tribal origin. 3. Fuad Bey informed me that the King had been deeply touched by the honours and attentions paid to the Amir Saud when he visited Bahrein last December, and was resolved to repay the debt of hospitality and courtesy with interest. He asked whether it was a fact that we now gave the sheikh the title of £t Highness,” and, learning that this was so, he said that the Saudi Government would use that form of address. He said that it was proposed to give the sheikh a salute of twenty-one guns when he landed, and asked to how many he was entitled according to our reckoning. He made no comment when I informed him, after enquiry from Bahrein, that His Majesty’s Government had accorded to His Highness a salute of eleven guns, and I forebore to comment on the proposal to give the sheikh a larger number here, feeling that that was, after all, Ibn Sand’s concern. I believe that the salute fired did, in fact, consist of twenty-one guns, but it was inaudible at the quay where the sheikh landed, and was, moreover, complicated by explosions from a quarry, where a workman thought it would be amusing to let off twenty-one of a large number of charges which happened to be laid. 4. The reception provided by the Saudi authorities was very handsome. The full Saudi air fleet of six machines went out to meet the Londonderry and circled slowly round several times. Shortly after I had gone on board the Amir Feisal arrived, to be greeted with twenty-one guns from the ship. The meeting between the Amir and the sheikh was very friendly, and the sheikh was pleased with the programme of the ceremonial to be observed, which was read out to him by a Saudi official. On the ship the Amir insisted on the guest’s going in front of him. To maintain his dignity he whispered to me that this was out of respect for the sheikh’s age, but I have no doubt that it was by order of the King. In any case, the sheikh was quite equal to the occasion and accepted this not unreasonable act of courtesy with no more than the conventional resistance. 5. The sheikh seemed to have been very comfortable and happy on the Londonderry, and was most grateful for the attention shown to him by Captain Dowding. He left the ship full of thanks. 6. By the desire of the King, the Amir and the sheikh left in the same launch. A salute of twenty-one guns was fired for the Amir by the Londonderi'y, and after a short interval a salute of eleven guns for the sheikh. 7. The sheikh was met on the quay by the Amir Saud, who had come to Jedda for the purpose, and by a guard of honour and a great concourse of official and unofficial notables. There was a short reception in the new quarantine building, at which I had a place of honour on the right of the Amir Baud, who had the sheikh on his left. The sheikh then left for the Jedda office of the Minister of Finance, which had been prepared for his reception. He lunched with the Amir Feisal, as Viceroy, in the Khuzam Palace outside Jedda, and, after returning to his quarters in Jedda, set off to Mecca at about 4 p.m. I called on him before he left. He had not yet assumed the pilgrim garb, though ordinarily a pilgrim who intended to go to Mecca first, not to Medina, would land in the “ ihram,” but he put it on for the journey to Mecca. How this derogation from the religious rule was managed I do not know. 8. According to the press there was an official reception in Mecca the next morning, including a parade of troops, police, school-children, &amp;c., and an address [230 x—4] February 21, 1938 Section 4. Copy No. V ~ '•* ’ * 'by the Mayor of Mecca; and on three successive days the sheikh was entertained to dinner hy the King, the Amir Saud and the Amir Feisal. 9. The sheikh had accepted the proposal of Ihn Saud that he should return home by land via Riyadh after the pilgrimage. This meant that any entertain ment given in his honour by His Majesty’s Legation must be before the pilgrimage. It was ascertained that His Highness intended to come to Jedda on the 28th January to meet certain members of his family who were arriving by an Indian pilgrim ship, with whom he would proceed straight to Medina, and he kindly accepted an invitation to attend a reception at the Legation on that day. In the end it was arranged that his family should be taken to him at Mecca and that they should travel to Medina by the Ashaira Road instead of by the ordinary route via Jedda, but His Highness made a special journey to Jedda to be present at the reception, which was attended by the leading members of the British community and the most important official and unofficial Saudis. The sheikh was the life and soul of the party, talking with equal enthusiasm about the kindness and hospitality shown to him by Ibn Saud and by Captain Dowding, and the restoration of order in Arabia by the King and the wonders of H.M.S. Nelson and the Queen Mary. 10. It is pleasant to see the friendly relations between Saudi Arabia and Bahrein, as compared with the friction to which an end was put only two years ago by the agreements about customs dues and other points then in dispute, and if Ibn Saud uses thd occasion to make a small demonstration of pan-Arabism no serious harm will be done. The feeling found expression in a leading article in the Umm-al-Qura of the 28th January. It is headed “His Majesty the King gives an admirable example of Moslem friendship and Arab brotherhood ”—a phrase which occurs several times in the article itself. The article is not worth translating. It speaks of the welcome afforded to the Amir Saud in Bahrein as a demonstration of brotherly unity, and then comes a paragraph which may be given in full as a specimen of the whole :— “We are sure that the Arab nation whose union has been effected by His Majesty King Abdul Aziz will take a step (please God !) towards the establishment of its great unification based on understanding and sincerity between its kings, amirs, peoples and individuals. Such admirable Islamic manifestations are the distinguished foundations on which the lofty buildings of union and unity will be firmly based.” 11. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire (No. 263/397/38), the Political Agent, Bahrein, (No. 264/397/38) and the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, New Delhi (No. 265/397/38).

To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian &amp;lf y Camp iiahrain. Sir* In continuation of my telegram No. 282 dated the 15th November 1937 I Iiavo the honour to forward herewith a copy of a letter No. C/1345-1 dated the 14th November 1937 received from the Adviser to the Bahrain aoverraient* in which he informs me of the intention of His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin 1 Isa al Nhalifah to proceed on Haj this year and in which a request is made for assistance by conveying His Highness part of the way in His Majesty*s sloops. 2, The request for conveyance in sloops both between Bahrain and Bombay and between Aden and Jeddah is possibly somewhat excessive* particularly since the British India Steam Navigation Company pro vide a reasonably comfortable service from Iiahrain to Bombay* but I would I'ecormend that if possible arrange ments might be made to carry His Highness the Shaikh in one of His Majesty 1 a ships from Aden to Jeddah. Halations between His Highness and the Navy in the Gulf have been particularly cordial and it may per haps be mentioned that the Bahrain -ovemnent have shown admirable willingness to provide facilities for the Naval Base in Jufair. Not only is this so* but/-- 2 - but in othar directions also His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain h^s maintained excellent relations with the lesiiency and the Agency and at all times exhibits a friendly desire to co-operate in every way possible. To thin extant he differs noticeably from his neighbours on the Coast and it would, I suggest, be well to nark our appreciation of his attitude by extending to him the unusual honour of conveying him part of bis way to Jeddah. Finally His Highness* h alth is by no means robust and I fear that Ms health might suffer if he were compelled to travel in one of the somewhat primitive pilgrim ships between Aden and Jeddah. i 3. X trust, therefore, that it will be possible to make arrangements to meet His Highness* request in part if not in fill; and it will be of advantage if a decision can be communicated urgently so that definite arrangements may be made for the remainder of His Highness* journey and final dates fixed. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd. H. Weightman. Political A^ent, Bahrain.. _.
