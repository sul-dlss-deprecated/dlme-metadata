Dear Gibson, We had a visit recently from a Mr. Yehia, who came to talk about a scheme for forming an Anglo-Moslem Society. He left some papers describing the objects of the proposed Society and enumerating the benefits which both Great Britain and the Moslem world would be likely to derive from it. I enclose a copy of these papers, in v/hich you will find all the information we have about the scheme. 2. As regards the Anglo-Egyptian group, v/hich, as you will see, it is proposed to form under the auspices of the Anglo-Moslem Society, Mr. Yehia was told that we could not offer him any advice on the subject off-hand. It struck us as odd, hov/ever, that a Council containing Ministers of Moslem countries in general should include amongst its aims an endeavour to settle disputes arising out of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, or to ,f pave the way for ’’the - J.P. Gibson, Esq.'the removal of irksome terms in the Treaty 1 '. The British and Egyptian G-overnments were quite competent to settle between themselves any difficulties arising out of the Treaty, as had been very clearly shown this year. Mr. Yehia replied that this was only a draft made by himself, which he had also left v/ith Lord Lloyd for the latter's comments. 3. V/hen Mr. Yehia calls again, which he has announced his intention of doing, we propose to thank him for letting us know of his scheme but tell him that, before expressing a definite opinion on it, we should prefer to wait till it has taken more definite shape, and to know what persons are supporting it and are responsible for it. At the same time we propose to ask him v/hether his scheme bears any relation to the scheme defined for a Moslem Institute in London, for which our support was asked early in the year by Mr. Mougy, and which formed the subject of semi-official correspondence v/ith the India Office resting with peel's letter to me No. P.and J.(3)143/58 of the 25th February. Mr. Mougy's scheme concerned principallyprincipally British subjects. Mr. Yehia's scheme is concerned v/ith the relations between Great Britain and the Moslem powers and appears to be more political. But it is possible that there may be some rivalry between the two schemes and their respective promoters. In any case, we should v/ant to know whether they bear any relation to each other. Incidentally, it would of course be unnecessary, as well as inappropriate and useless, to try to foster friendship with Turkey through an Anglo-Moslem Society. 4. Meanwhile, we should be glad to know v/hether the India Office have any views on Mr. Yehia f s scheme. Yours sincerely,4 Moor Court, Coo^ (E 7098/467/65) Glenmore Hoad, ^ HAMPSTEAD, N.W.5. 16th November, 1938* Your Excellency, I am desired by Sir Nairne Stewart-Sandeman, M.P., to request Your Excellency to be good enough to cause an enquiry to be made of the competent authorities in Cairo regarding the accompanying draft scheme - The Anglo-Moslem Society. Sir Nairne, who is promoting the Society, wishes to know whether the scheme finds favour and support in Egypt. The scheme is considered a very desirable one by a number of well-connected members in both Houses of parliament who will give their public support as soon as the acquiescence of the Moslem countries is ascertained. Sir Nairne wishes me to say that the goodwill on the British side for the success of the scheme is not lacking. I shall be grateful to Your Excellency if the result of the enquiry is communicated either to Sir Nairne Stewart- Sandeman at the House of Commons, or to the writer at above address. With Sir Nairne’s compliments, and my humble appreciation I am etc., His Excellency The Ambassador, British Embassy, Cairo, Secretary. Egypt.— D R A ? T SCHEME - ANGLQ-M0SL3M SQCI E T Y. The objects of the movement are to promote product ive friendship and consolidate good understanding and. mutual trust between Great Britain and countries where people profess Islam. This will benefit Great Britain, the Moslem countries, individually and collectively, as well as Islam. These objects can be achieved only by mutual co operation and assistance. The Council will be formed, on one side, of the Ambassadors and Ministers in London of the Moslem countries. The members on the British side will be composed only of influential people in both Houses of Parliament who are in full sympathy with and ready to support the movement wholeheartedly, forming, with others, Parliamentary Groups for the different countries. It is expected that a member of the Government will join the Council. It is hoped that the Council will meet in the near future, when the scheme in full detail will be placed before the Council for discussion. However, the following is a brief outline of the functions of the Anglo-Egyptian Parliamentary Group - to be formed under the auspices of the Society - as well as some of the benefits to the Moslem countries collectively Objects of the Anglo-Egyptian Group. 1. To establish personal contact with the Egyptians, f. To promote closer understanding and trust between Great Britain and Egypt. 3. To maintain and consolidate their good relations. 4. To keep in constant touch with Egyptian news and understand the Egyptian point of view. 5. To5 . To endeavour to settle disputes arising out of the application of 'The Treaty of Friendship and Alliance' by way of conciliation before the disputes reach an official stage. 6. To pave the way for the removal of the irksome terns in the Treaty, such terms as may have been dictated through too much caution, lack of confidence, or otherv/ise. This is in alignment with the Treaty, Article 4 of v/hich reads - 'An alliance is established between the high contracting parties with a view to consolidating their friendship, their cordial understanding and their good relations'. The Treaty, in another part, speaks about friendship that will be 'for all time'. Friendship between the two countries will thus have to be enduring - this requires human contact. It is, therefore, hoped that the Anglo-Egyptian Group will visit Egypt in the near future to establish the desired contact. Misunderstandings between nations do frequently occur. The Group will have to work perpetually for the removal of any misunderstandings. By maintaining goodwill between the two nations, the Group will be in an ideal position to try to seek, in a conciliatory spirit, the adjustment of a good number of disputes that might arise from the application of the Treaty before such disputes reach the stage of formal negotiations. Some benefits to Moslem countries collectively, and to Islam. 1. Consolidation of democracy. 2. Facilities to Moslems for the revival of Islam - its teaching and spirit. 3. Facilities for the spread of knowledge and interchange of ideas. Amicable settlement of disputes between Moslem countries 4.and Great Britain. The benefits of a strong friend in times of anxiety and crisis. Facilities to Moslems for promoting the unity of Moslem countries.© v 1 ANG-LO-MOSLEM SOCIETY. 0O0 The objects are to promote productive friendship, con solidate good understanding and mutual trust between Great Britain-and the Moslems all over the world. This can be achieved only by mutual co-operation and assistance to the benefit of both Great Britain and Islam. Benefits to Great Britain: (1) Democratic Britain will have the ready support of democratic Islam in preserving democracy. (2) Moslems, with the help of Britain, will form a bul wark against paganism and anarchism. (3) Activities of malicious propaganda in Moslem countries will be ineffective. (4) The amicable settlement of disputes between Great Britain and the Moslem countries. (5) Moslems within the British Empire (comprising one- ouarter of the Empire’s population) will not find it irreconcilable with their religious doctrines to stand by a country that is a friend and ally to Islam. (6) The bond of the leaders of Islam v/ith Great Britain will guarantee the perpetuation of peaceful relations between Great Britain and Moslems. Benefits to Moslems: (1) Consolidation of democracy. (2) Facilities to Moslems for the revival of Islam - its teaching and spirit. (2) Facilities(3) Facilities for the spread of knowledge and inter change of ideas.

Our records show that a Mr. Mohammed Yehia, who lives at 24, Belsize Grove, Hampstead, appealed to us in November 1935 to approach the Egyptian Government on his behalf and support his petition to be reinstated as an Egyptian Government scholar on the grounds that he had done useful service for His Majesty’s Government. Upon investigation we found that Mr. Yehia had no claims, either political or scholastic, to special consideration. The Residency in Cairo confirmed this impression and told us that he had been in this country since 1922 studying for the B.Sc. which, after a good many years’ work, he failed to secure. While/ M.J. Clauson, Esq.While v/e laiov/ nothing to Mr. Yehia f s discredit he told a lengthy and very improhaole story when he appealed to us for help in 1955, and our impression is that he is given to romancing and possibly to the formation of rather nebulous committees. All this tends to confirm the information contained in the confidential note enclosed in your letter of the 8th April. I think that the Prince Adil Arsalan whom Mr. Yehia mentions as a member of his committee is clearly the Emir Adil Arslan, a Druse who was pro-Turk during the v/ar, and took an active part in the Syrian Rebellion of 1925-6, for which he has not been amnestied, expelled from Egypt in 1931 after anti-Italian agitation and now spends a good deal of his time in Iraq, where he acquired Iraqi nationality anc seems to have entirely dropped out of Arabian politics. He spends a good deal of time in this country and is friendly with various prominent Englishmen. has business interests. He is believed to have His brother is the Emir Shekib Arslan, who is/z\ ® is well known to th.e Colonit?.! Ox'iice ns a dangerous agitator in Palestine and a man who is credibly reported to have received money from foreign governments for the purpose of encouraging anti-British activities in Palestine, V/e have not, however, any very recent information about the Emir Adil Arslan and he appears to be a more reputable person than his brother. However, the general impression which these two gentlemen make is not very encouraging, and we agree that it would probably be wise to advise Sir Abdul Qadir to refuse this invitation.INDIA OFFIC/i, /HITSHAU, 3 .W. 1 . 8 th pril, 1937. Dear Pink, ^ollo*: in iry letter of 2nd ;pnl f 1 enclose a copy of a confidential note about Mr. Yehia. It rather look* ac if he was a oerson of no iniTX)rtance, and that he may perhaps be addicted to bad company. To doubt we should advise Sir ib(iul ^adir to refuse his invitation politely, but perhaps you would kimily confirm, before e actually do so, that tne results of your researches in the 1 orei n Office have been negative. (Sgd.) LLJ. Clauson. I.T. . Pink, so., mmim OFFICE S.tf. 1 .1198 I attach a copy of a letter to the Foreign Office about a ivr. Yehia.

Mr. silver — MOHAXffiD YEHIA, of 24 Belsize Grove, Hampstead N.W.3., is an Egyptian who was horn on 8.10.99 in Cairo. He arrived in the U.fc. on 23.7.22 from Cairo, and on 27.12.22, was married at the Islington Registry Office to Florrie MOCKFORD, a British subject. He holds an Egyptian passport? No.8. issued in London on 14.4.32. He has resided at many addresses in London and the provinces since he arrived in the U.K. He is stated to he an engineering student, hut evidently interests himself in propaganda, as he is said to he the author of a pamphlet entitled “Britain and Egypt”. who is understood to he a brother of Emir SHAKIB ARSLAN, the well-known Arab leader. This brother visited the U.S.A. in 1930 as a member of a delegation to obtain support for the Arab cause in Palestine. For the last couple of years or so he is said to have given up politics and to be living quietly in Iraq, where he has always been a strong supporter of King Feisal. Like his brother, however, he has been suspected (although the suspicion has never been sub stantiated) of being involved with Italian intrigues. It was not known that he was in the U.K. at the present time (which is what Mohamed Yehia’s statement to Sir Abdul Qadir would seem to imply)• I am having some further enquiries made about Mohamed Yehia which may take a little time. Prince ADEL ARSALAN may be the Arab of that name MPm — c^roe over to this country as an engineering student.
