I beg to state that at the termination of the diving season X gave some pearl dust to the value of Ks.2000/- to one of the subjects of oheikh Said bin ^aktum, Baler of J-»ebai, through another subject of his. fhe man then alleged that he had lost the pearl dust. X reported the matter to sheikh Said bin ^aktum and asked him to have the case dealt with according to commercial rules. The sheikh said that the defendant was bound to pay the value of the pearl dust and that it was not necessary to deal with him according to the usual procedure. As 1 saw that the Bheikh was procrastinating in the matter ± submitted my case to the residency Agent who addressed a letter to the sheikh asking him to settle my case according to the customary rules, fhe sheikh did not agree and asked me to go with his subject to the Shara 1 . With the information of the Residency Agent I attended the Bhara 1 where my claim was proved, j-he sheikh then asked me to conprornise the claim and said that he would pay the amount which would be agreed upon, ihe claim was compromised without my consent for as. 800/- to be paid at once. I refused to take the but amount/owing to the losses which I sustained on account of delay I was obliged to accept the compromise. I represented the matter to the Aesidency Agent who wrote a letter to the sheikh but the latter put me off day by day. He then paid me Hs.136/-. He has now told me that the defendant has some date-trees to the value of Hs.100 and whenever they are sold the sale proceeds will be paid to me. Or I should take the date-trees in fall settlement of my claim. I have sustained losses to the extent of Hs.500/- on account of hire of motor cars between Debai and Sharjah and payment of interests to the persons from whom X have borrowed money.

Ali bin Ibrahim handed over the pearls to Ahmad al ^alil without weighing them and he has no definite proof as to the weight and value of the pearls as will be seen from the copy of the letter of the huler of ~ebai dated 3rd ^amadi II, 1356 (10th August 1937) forwarded herewith, xhe matter was referred to a Committe of merchants who deemed it desirable to compromise the case by payment of As.800/- by Ahmad al ^alil to ah bin Ibrahim Hyderabadi. ihe Ruler of ~ebai wrote a letter to the merchants asking them to contribute as far as they could afford towards the debt of Ahmad al 'alii for payment to Ali bin Ibrahim but the latter did not accept the compromise in consequence of which the questio of the contribution was delayed. After a few days he acceptedPH ■V , 1 r '\LLI 2. the compromise but the merchants were not so zealous as they were before towards contributing the amount owing to the 'all in ^he price of the pearls, -^hey then contributed a sum of *s.l70/- only out of which as. 136 were collected and paid to *li. fhe palm trees belonging to Ahjaad were put into auction but they fetched ns.100/-. Ali bin J-brahim alleged that the value of the palm- trees was “s.700/-. X told him to take them for “s.lOO/- but Ali refused and said that the amount should be paid by the shaikh himself. i'he plaintiff Ali bin Ibrahim has admitted that Ahmad al ^ali] is a strightforward man and neither^property nor a so ’rce or income. I told Ali to take the amount collected by contribution and the palm trees or their value and for the balance the defendant should give a bond in which he has to undertake to pay his debt whenever kxr the plaintiff Ali can prove that the defendant is in possession of anything, but Ali is demanding payment at once though he knows very well that there is no possibility of getting anything. I await your instructions in this matter. °sual ending. better dated 29th 3amadi I, 1356 (6th August 1937) from Abdur Aahman bin iAihamad nafidh to shaikh Said bin ii^aktum. A.C.

A»C* With regard to my case about the missing pearls, i beg to state that Shaikh ^aid bin Maktum referred the matter to the leaders of the tov/n for settlement and the case was settled for Rs*800/-* I could not oppose the decision of the Majlis which was formed by the order of the Shaikh though I had sustained heavy losses. A sum of As* 136/- was paid to me and in accordance with the decision of the '*eglis the balance of As.668/- was to be paid to me.after a few days. About 22 months have since elapsed and in suite of my repeated demands I have not been able to recover anything. I have been suffering from fever for about one year on account of which I am not able to do any work and moreover the doctors who examibed me have prevented me from going out. I have to pay for medicine and to support my family. I am hard up and have no one to help me except 4od and you. I beg you to extend your favours to me and settle my case. I have on many occasions approached the Residency Agent who was kind enough to write to the Shaikh asking him to recover my dues but the bhaikh said that he would give me date-pi an tat ions and a reed hut the value of all of which amounts to As.200/-. L$r opponent can afford to pay my dues but owing to the Shaikh's help to his subjects he is not paying my claim. 1 beg you to give my case your favourable consideration as I am a family man, sick and unable to earn a livelihood, l beg you to extend your justice to me and recover my claim as it is outstanding since the last two years. 1 should be grateful if you would very kindly settle my case as soon as possible.

I am very much surprised at this case which no one else had experienced especially as I am a subject of the British Government through whom no oppressed persons* right was ever lost. I wonder how one of Shaikh Sa*id bin Maktoom*s subjects after taking from me pearls worth Hs. 2000/- says, two hours later that they have been lost. Sod only knows whether his statement is not false. It is possible that he gave to another person to sell it so that he can benefit by its value. Since that time I have been experiencing great^trouble with ray creditors and am in difficult circumstances. I wrote to you that I am sick and unable to earn my living. If you enquire about my sickness and poverty the fact will be clear to you. I also incurred much expendes for my repeated joumies between Sharjah and Mibai by car. I am ready at your order and whal ever the Hesidency Agent might direct I will obey, tty right has been proved before the Shar*a and in accordance with trade regulations. After all this trouble I have not been given my right# I place ray complete confidence in the Government and I am sure that through them ray right will not be lost because never in my life did I hear that somebody^s right was lost through them as they are the source of Justice# My opponent is in the best of happiness and pleasure since that time while I am in trouble. I most earnestly request you to remeber that I am in the last breath of poverty and sadness and I have none to relieve me of this injustice except the Government.
