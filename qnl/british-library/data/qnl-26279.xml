(E 661/661/93) No. 22. 7“ s (84/1/34) British Embassy, Bagdad. 10th January, 1934. Sir, In reply to your despatch No. 757 (E 7046/4/93) of the 30th November, 1933, I have the honour to report that I have ascertained from several conversations which I have had with Nuri Pasha that the attitude which the Iraqi Govern ment desire totake up in regard to the provisions of Article 34 of the British draft Disarmament Convention is that the Iraqi Government must reserve the right to use their air forces for internal police purposes. Should, however, one of their neighbour States make a declaration reserving the right to employ air forces for all purposes, a similar right would have to be claimed by the Iraqi Government. 2. That Jafar Pasha received instructions to make a declaration on these lines seems quite clear from the record of his interview with Mr. Rendel which was sent to me with your despatch No. 319 (E 2660/4/93) of the 24th May, 1933. 3. It also seems clear that, in the statement which he actually made at the 68th Meeting of the Disarmament Conference, he departed from his instructions, probably as the result of pressure brought to bear on him by Mr. Cadogan (see Mr. Rendel’s telegram to His Majesty^ Consul at Geneva No. 17 of the 20th May, 1933). 4. The intention of the instructions sent to Nuri Pasha at Geneva in November last, to which you referred in your despatch under reply, was merely that a further state ment should be made by the Iraqi Representative at the /Disarmament The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., K.C.V.O., etc., etc., etc.Disarmament Conference with a view to rectifying Jafar Pasha f s departure from his original instructions. There was no change of policy, as I think can he seen from a comparison of the note drafted hy Mr. Edmonds for Nuri Pasha with the explanation of his instructions wnich Jafar Pasha gave to Mr. Rendel at the Foreign Office on the 20th May. 5. The Iraqi Government’s point is that provided no neighbouring State reserves the right to employ its air forces for wider purposes, they merely wish to retain for themselves the right to use their aeroplanes for internal police work. The statement made hy Jafar Pasha (contrary to his instructions) at the 68th Meeting of the Disarmament Conference put them in the entirely different position of reserving the right to employ their air forces for any purpose within their own territory; an attitude which no other State has taken up and which, therefore, appears to the Iraqi Government to he invidious. 6. I have persuaded Nuri Pasha to send instructions to Taufiq Suwaidi at Geneva to take no action until Article 34 once more comes up for discussion at the Disarmament Conference, and he has also agreed that even when this occurs no statement will actually he made without prior consultation with me. He has further undertaken that the Iraqi Representative at Geneva will keep in close touch with the British Delegation regarding this matter. 7. I imagine that some time is likely to elapse before the provisions of Article 34 of the British draft Convention are again actively discussed hy the Disarmament /ConferenceConference and in the meanwhile it would be useful to me to know more precisely the objections which, when consulted by Nuri Pasha, you would wish me to put forward to the attitude which the Iraqi Government desire to take up in regard to the provisions of this Article.

Tho unendment which the Iraqi Ooverment wish to make cello for a preliminary observation with a view to clarifying the isouo. Paragraph 1 of your despatch, like the draft declaration enclosed In my despatch Ho. 767 of 60th Hovembcr, suggests that what la in question is the use of air forces In general, whereas Article 64 of the Graft convention Is only concerned with the employment of a particular kind of air action, namely bombing. The driftft declaration referred to above would appear to preclude tho use of air action even other than bombing, except for internal police purposes. I feel sure that this does not represent the real intention of the Iraqi Government. 6. Vrom the point of view of His Majesty’s Government in the Halted Kingdom, the main question for consideration Is/ His Excellency Lieutenant-colonel ;lr Francis Humphry*, a.C.il.O., G.C.V.O., etc,, etc., etc.,4*^ Is whether the attitude which the Iraqi Government propose to take up in connexion with Article 34 of the Draft Convention would in any way hamper Hie Majesty*a Government xn themselves tricing such air action, arising out of their Greeted position in Iraq, as they might consider compatible with that Article if and when it enters into effect* 4. Vhe rights of Hi a Majesty* a Government in this respect have already been reserved, by inference at all events, in the statement which Mr. Men made prior to Jafar Pasha’s declaration at the sixty-eighth meeting of the jlaaiMiaiaent Conference (see Foreign Office print: League of Nations, 9th ^Tune, 1933, section 2)* I am therefore disposed to consider that the situation would not be materially altered if the Iraqi Government were now to amend Jafer Pasha’s declaration on the lines foreshadowed in paragraph 1 of your despatch, provided that the amendment were eo worded as to make it clear that it referred to bombing only, and not to other forms of air action* 5. At the same time, it would be preferable that the amendment should not restrict too narrowly the right to bomb by specifying that it shall be for 'internal’* police purposes only* Vhie might be regarded as ruling out the use of bombing in a particular case where possibly it might otherwise be Justified as a police measure, namely, against tribal incursions across the frontier, not involving war with the country from which they came. Should therefore the Iraqi Government think of utilising the draft enclosed in my despatch No. W of 30th November, as the basis of their amendment it would be advisable for them to substitute for #for tli© words 'reserve the right to use sir forces for 'purposes of Internal police only' 1 the phrase 'reserve the right to homh for police purposes', which corresponds more closely with the actual wording of Article 34 of the Draft Convention, There is of course a danger that, if Jafar Pasha’s declaration io amended too ostentatiously by the Iraqi Government, undesirable attention may be drawn to the position of His Majesty’s aovernment in the matter, and questions concerning the future function of the Royal Air Vorco in Iraq may be raised prematurely. It is desirable therefore, that the Iraqi Government should be induced to make the amendment not in the form of a note but only orally in the course of the discussion when article 34 of the Draft Convention is next considered. ?• I leave it to your discretion to decide whether further action on your part is necessary at this stage although, unless you see strong reasons for taking such action, I consider, after consultation with the Air Ministry, that it le preferable to leave the matter entirely in abeyance until article 34 once more comes up for discussion at the Disarmament Conference.

Cutting from issue dated POLICE BOMBING. To the Editor of the Birmingham Post. Sir,—I am afraid Air Commodore Chamier has missed the point of the resolution passed by the No More War Movement at its annual conference last iweek-end. That movement is not disposed to argue about the comparative morality of air versus land bombing. It objects to both, and to an Imperialism which requires either. The central point is that the trouble on the North-West Frontier of India arises from the military demands in connection with that strategic region. The tribes there have a hard struggle to make ends meet, and while British Imperialism can find unlimited sums of money to “ defend ” the area, it has none to spare to establish the wretched inhabitants in a reason able form of existence. That is why Gandhi long ago contended that if it had the power, a self-governing India could soon settle the problem of the North-West Provinces, and be in pocket. A contented and prospering people is a better defence to a country than the most lavish military expenditure. Although I think it matters little to the sufferer whether his house is blown down by an air or a land bomb, I think there is grave danger in a form of attack which is exceedingly cheap, especially when the attacker is a great Imperialist Power, and the attacked are a defenceless and downtrodden people. In such circumstances I do not think that any Govern ment ought to have the right to use the air weapon at all. But it is only fair to say that, in my view, an Imperialism which requires any kind of militarism to defend it has gone astray, failed in its supposed duty, and that if it were wise it would acknowledge the fact and seek an honourable way out of the predicament in which it finds itself. Wilfred Wedlock, Chairman, No More War Movement. Victoria Avenue, Quinton, October 20. To the Editor of the Birmingham Post. Sir,—Air Commodore Chamier’s defence of police bombing would seem to suggest that it would be unreasonable for us here in England to resent air raids, provided that we first found ;ome caves into which to retire with our women md children, leaving our towns and cities, which mean little more to us than their homes do to the native tribes, to be razed to the ground. His analogy of an aeroplane as being “ merely the policeman that brings the offender to justice” is also rather quaint. Even the criminal classes will agree with me that, with all the average policeman’s faults, he does not effect an arrest by blowing up a fellow s home xn d, in the event of the unfortunate occupant not having stood clear, proceed to drag the corpse to the police station. | suggest that Lord Cecil, in his recent speech at Geneva, described Air Commodore Chamier’s attitude very justly when he said that there is a tendency on the part of Service men to think of war only in terms of the actual weapons with which they themselves fight.

The question whether this tragedy could and should have been prevented is one to which I have naturally given anxious consideration. An outrage of this kind was always a possible move on the part of the various cliques in Kabul who desire a deterioration of Anglo-Afghan relations, and the circumstances in which a certain Babu Lai was arrested in May, 1932 v/ill be remembered. In my despatch No.139 of the 28th December last I suggested that the failure of Ghulem Nabi's conspiracy and his summary execution might be expected to tum the tho ights of King Nadir Shah's opponents towards his assassination. His Majesty however is very carefully guarded, and an easier victim was found in his half-brother, Sardar Muhammad Aziz Khan. The latter's murder might have been regarded merely as the second step in an Afghan bloodfeud begun by the execution of Ghulam Nabi, had it not been for Said Kemal's statement that his act was intended as a protest against the predominance of British influence in this country. The publicity given by the press to this declaration increased the probability that this crime would before long be imitated in Afghanistan itself, and secret intelligence, which I soon afterwards received from India, pointed in the same direction. No. 120 x XI I 3. There were other factors which contributed to the gravity of the situation. At intervals during the present year the closeness of the relations existing between the Governments of India end King Nadir Shah had been emphasised in official utterances, and these provided ready made material for propaganda that the King had entered into a secret agreement with the Government of India, for the subjugation of the Pathsn tribes of the North West Frontier. Further material for such propaganda was supplied towards the end of July by the move of Indian troops into Hohmand country, and as was subsequently discovered (vide paragraph 3 of my telegram No.141 of the 16th September) Amanullah Khan lost no time in maJking use of this material. The situation was aggravated by suggestions in the Indian press that the bombing of Kotkai had been undertaken in order to oblige King Nadir Shah and in accordance with his representations, while to make matters still worse, the Indian newspapers at the beginning of August were discussing with apparent seriousness the adoption of a strong forward policy throughout the tribal belt. By the middle of the month the Kabul intelligentsia were studying a message from the special correspondent of the Civil and Military Gazette at Simla, in which it was urged that the time had come to disarm the Pathan tribes, by force if necessary. Such were the effusions mentioned in paragraph 5 of my telegram No.120 of the 19th August, and the Prime Minister referred to them with a gesture of despair more eloquent than words. x x X X« COPY OS P.Z. 6614/33.

The Dispute between the Mohmands and the British. According to reliable information lately received relating to the dispute between the Mohmands and the British Government it would appear that the question of the Mohmands and the Government of India is daily increasing in gravity and complexity. The Upper Mohmands and other tribes are seriously disturbed in mind and regard their freedom sgid tribal existence as endangered by the hostile attitude of the Halimzais and the British Government. They are hourly endeavouring to increase the strength of their lashkars and stir up general excitement among the tribes of the frontier. According to recent information severe fighting, resulting in heavy casualties to both sides, has taken place between the English forces and the Mohmand lashkar. Up to now no settlement, by which the general peace and security of the frontier might be assured, has been reached. We have already explained in our number 661 that these complications and this uneasiness are the fault of d) the Halimzais, for the disputes of the independent frontier tribes always used to be settled by jirgas and tribal assemblies and the Government of India never used to interfere in such matters by sending troops. This mistake is the fault of the Halimzais and if the Government of India has no ulterior object in view (Translator’s note, (l) in Persian 'azad.)2 . (such as the Mohmand tribes think and which they interpret as their extinction as a tribe) then the matter may perhaps be brought to a satisfactory , • (2) conclusion. If however the support of the Halimzais and their calls for assistance are only a pretext, then tne affair will gradually assume serious proportions -nd the Government of India will obtain no benefit from its advance on the frontier. It will on the contrary incur the general enmity of the Afghan tribes and will cause an outcry against itself from the whole Muslim world. Up to now the British Government has announced that troops have only been sent to Gandab in order to establish and maintain peace between the Upper and Lower Mobmands and it has stated that the Government of India has not as its object the establishment of its control over the Mohmands. We can only say that if the British Government treats the Mohmands well and kindly and does not interfere with their freedom the result will be advantageous both to itself and to the tribes of the frontier. If not, then the British Government will obtain nothing from the dry hills and barren valleys of the frontier except the echo of hostile voices. (Transiat or’s note.

COPY OP fe Hew Delhi, The 2 3-* ^October 1933. 32 4 ' Would you kindly refer to your private letter of 8th September in regard to the answer to be given on the subject of the Kotkai bombing? 2. This letter has been seen by both the Army and Air Force authorities, who were asked for their comments and I enclose, with their permission copies of the minutes recorded by Sir John Steel and Sir Kenneth Wigram* together with a copy of my own note on the subject. The Air Officer Commanding is, as you will see, disposed to agree with the attitude taken up by the Air Ministry and endorsed in your letter under reply, namely that the bombing was never intended to 'enforce compliance* with our demands, but was purely of a ’punitive* nature. On the other hand the Chief of the General Staff is inclined to the view which I hold myself that it is difficult if not impossible to distinguish between action taken to ’punish’ and action taken to ’enforce compliance* at any rate in a case of this nature. 3. As you will see however both these officers are agreed that whatever answer is given it should not conflict with the terms of the speech delivered by His ExcellencyExcellency the Viceroy to the Assembly on August 30th and with the language held by Tottenham in replying to the Adjournment motion on September 4th* You will have received by now printed copies of these speeches* and will no doubt be able to frame replies to any question which may be asked in the House of Commons on the same lines* Yours sincerely, 3d.

Walton, Esquire, C.B., M.C., Secretary, political Department, India Office, London.Air .. • • X X X 2* I do not, however, quite agree with para 4 of Major Praser-Tytier *s Note as I suggest it is necessary to concentrate on one object on any one plane. On the highest plane, the object was to demonstrate to the Afghan Government that we meant business. To give effect to this object by air action there were two alternative courses *- (a) Bombing to enforce compliance. (b) Bombing as a punishment. The two are quite separate and call for different treatment. In the case of the former, bombing is intermittent and harassing, great destruction of property is not aimed at, and bombing ceases as soon as the offending tribesmen comply with the terms of the ultimatum. In the case of the latter, bombing may take one of two forms, either series of intermittent harassing attacks over a period, or a heavy bombardment until a definite degree of destruction has been achieved. Although purely '‘punitive' bombing is a legitimate use of Air Power, I very much deprecate its use except under exceptional circumstances, as in the KOTKAI case under review. 3. I submit that the official reply should state that bombing was never employed to 'enforce compliance'. This is borne out by the following sequence of events i The A. G.G. recommended that an ultimatum should be given to the Bajaur tribes implicated, that certain persons were to be surrendered to the Government. If this was done a reward would be given. If this Order was not obeyed, the Government would inflict exemplary punishment. These recommendations the Government of India &amp;gxs approved in principle. As the tribes did not comply with the Order and failed to hand over the persons concerned, the Government decided to takeAi r Action; that it was purely punitive evidenced by (a) the terms of the Bombing Notices dropped on the offending village, KOTKAI, which stated j- M As the stranger who is intriguing against the Afghan Government has not been handed over, the village of KOTKAI will be bombed for a period of 10 days beginning at dawn on Aug. 1st and ending at sunset on Aug. 10th. You are warned to remove yourselves your women and your children from KOTKAI Village and its vicinity during this period'. (b) The fact that as soon as aJequate destruction had been achieved, incidentally after three days, bombing was immediately stopped. Had it been the intention to 'enforce compliance’' the notices would have contained words to the effect that bombing would continue until the Strangers had been handed over. 4, I agree with Secretary, Army Department, that it is most desirable that any statement made by H.M.Government should fit it with the official explanation given by His Excellency the Viceroy to the legislature and by himself on his speech on the adjournment Motion, and I submit that what I have suggested does not in any way conflict with these views. Sd. J.M. Sttel, Air Marshal Air Officer Commanding, Boyal Air Force, India, 30th Sep.*33 #Note fry Sir Kenneth Wigram. * * * * * * I agree with Foreign Secretary*s analysis in para 3. Foreign Secretary's note para 4. Personally I find it difficult to draw any distinction “between 'enforcing compliance with a specific demand* and •punishment for disobedience or misconduct* as the latter wouldjtiot he resorted to until some specific demand had been made to desist, and that would automatically bring it into the first category. I also find it difficult to distinguish between the methods adopted in bombing for punishment and bombing to enforce compliance since in both operations the only weapon is the bomb and the only objective the village, for I cannot believe that the Air Force would care to scatter their bombs broadcast in the fields adjoining villages* I suggest that any attempt to draw this distinction in public will do far more harm than good and will invoke criticism which we should find it very difficult to refute. To say as Mr. Walton suggests that the bombing was never intended to enforce compliance but solely as a punishment because the tribesmen had not complied with Grovernment instructions is surely a contradiction in terms. The A.O.C. also in his note says that bombing was never employed to enforce compliance but was carried out because the tribes did not comply with the order. Foreign Secretary*s note para 5. For the reasons stated above I am strongly opposed to accepting Mr. Walton*s formula at the end of his letter, and agree with Secretary, A.D* that we must stick as closely as possible to the official version as given in India, both in H.E. the Viceroy*s speech and in Secretary's speech in the House. Any departure from these must inevitably land us in hostile criticism. Any formula must tie our hands. Sd.Kenneth Wigram. 2.10.33.X X X 4 • • • 3. Mr. Walton*8 pri vate letter of 8th September . The criticism in this letter is chiefly directed by the Air Ministry against the framing of the object in the bombing of Kotkai; 'which appears to them to have been confused. I do not think however that that was the case; there certainly was no confusion in my mind as to the objects to be attained, though they may not have been brought out very clearly in our telegrams. I would cite these objects as follows*- (a) To demonstrate to the Afghan Government that we meant business . This in view of the rapidly deteriorating situation in Kabul and the failure of political pressure on the Bajauris was clearly the first essential. The only alternative, i.e. to send a column into Bajaur was at the time impracticable, and there was no other available method of making such a demonstra tion until at any rate the beginning of September. (b) To effect the disposal of the agitators . % This is referred to as surrender in our telegram of 19th July, partly because Minister in his telegram of 10th July had emphasised that nothing less would satisfy the Afghans and restore our position in Kabul, and partly because the Governor in his telegram of 15th July had held out a slight hope that the measure we contemplated might bring about this result. Actually I had grave doubts whether we should ever effect surrender by these or any other means but I foresaw that we might effect expulsion. (c) To punish the harbourers of these men. This was clearly indicated in the Governor’s telegram of 15th July, para 4(c), and accepted by us in Government of India telegram of 19th July para 4(c). Punishment was inflicted on the worst offenders and ceased when sufficient damage had been done.4. I can see no particular objection to having more than one objective in a case of this sort. The Air Ministry f s criticism seem to suggest that if punitive action only was required» our object was attained but in that case there should have been no idea of ^enforcing compliance*, while if the latter was required it could have been accomplished without the destruction of Kotkai. As it sl happened however we had both objects in view, and in addition the primary object of impressing the jwfghan Government. I am veiy doubtful whether we should have accomplished this last by the action suggested in the last paragraph of the Air Ministry’s letter. 5. I would suggest that we should reply on the above lines to the India Office, but that we might add that if His Majesty’s Government see grave objection to mentioning the fact that the bombing was intended to ’enforce compliance* in some form or other, we have no objection to their adopting the formula suggested at the end of the letter under reply, although in fact the possibility that the atoc air action takfcn might clear up the position, if not exactly as we demanded, at any rate in a maiMer that would satisfy the Afghans, was not absent from our minds.

Lengthy discussions hare taken place at the Disarmament Conference in connection with the prohibition of aerial bombing. The majority of the repi'esentatires of the powers hare agreed to the prohibition of all aerial bombing without any reservation, with the exception of the British Ooremraent which desires to reserve for itself the right of employing aerial bombing on the frontier against Afghan tribes. The representatives of Irag and Siam have accordingly also claimed a similar right for their respective Governments. The 'Illustrated London Kews* has recently published photographs showing the successful results of bombing by British aeroplanes on the frontier and thus apparently demonstrates to the world at large that the employment of aerial bombing against the tribes of the frontier has proved very profitable to the British Government. This paper claims that aerial bombing is the only economical means of suppressing disturbances caused on the frontier by Afghan tribes. According to information received by the'I slab* the representative of His Sftgesty mhamniad Hadir shah Ghazi at the Msamraament Conference has laid, and is continuingto lay, great stress on the question of the prohibition of aerial bombing without any reservation* Afghanistan, which shares a oomnon creed, language and religion with the Frontier tribe®, can in no way agree to the employment of such methods against the tribes* Afghan honour in the eyes of the civilised world is vitally affected by the fact that the use of aerial bombing should be prohibited for all the nations of the world and that it should only be tolerate! against Afghans* If aerial bombing is considered inhuman in $*rope, then its use against Afghans is also inhuman* All human beings have an equal right to protection of life and property* It is neither Just nor equitable that only fine edifices should have the right of immunity against aerial bombing while the huts of poor Afghans are allowed to remain a target for aeroplane bombs* We endorse the sound remarks made by the Government of His Majesty Uahemmad Hadir Shah Ghazi at the Disarmament Conference regarding the acceptance of the principle of the prohibition of % r * aerial bombing without reservations* Translator^ note* i*e* Serial bombing 9 *fa ' INDtXED In any further communication on this subject, please quota No - Lo ni- ht~~l and address —not to why person by name, but to— / “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

I have seen none of the articles on the subject of this tour which have been published in the 'Daily Uail*' The local Press has commented favourably on them, however, and Monsieur Urbain Blanc at a reception recently given at the Residency General (see my despatch No.94 of September let) told me that he considered these artic3.e8 to be some of the best he ha© read about Morocco. The Ddldgud, in fact greatly complimented Mr. Ward Price on hie efforts and said he would have the whole series of articles translated and placed in the official archives of the Residency. 3 , Mr, ward Price visited this Consulate-General at the conclusion of his tour and said that he had been greatly surprised by the number of troops the French hati had to employ for the purposes of 'pacification . He added that aeroplanes were being employed in large numbers and, while he was on the scene of action, the Air Force huu unaertaken several big bombing operations, generally using 100 kilo- gram bombs in order to bring down the rocks and cliffs over the hiding places of the 'dissidents'.

Dear Consulate General, The Soviet delegates at Geneva and the Soviet press have been filled with righteous indignation at our reservation in regard to air action in outlying regions. (Article 34 of the United Kingdom Draft Disarmament Convention). There is no doubt that the Soviet Government have used, and continue to use, aerial bombardment as a means of putting down trouble. We have not, however, any recent reports on the subject, and it would be interesting to know whether they have been using this form pacification lately on the Afghan Frontier or in Turkmenistan. Will you kindly let us have any information you can collect on the matter? We are sending similar letters to Kabul and Kashgar. Yours ever, LKAGUE OF NATIONS AND WESTERN DEPARTMENT.

If he were to be authorised to withdraw his declara tion it seems to me that we might be put in an awkward position. If our right to aeronautics in Iraq were not to go by default we should I suppose have to make a specific declaration. Hitherto we have only associated ourselves with declaration which he made.

You should endeavour to ascertain whether Jafar Pasha has recommended withdrawal of reservation and if so what instructions Iraqi government contemplate sending him« If they contemplate authorising him to withdraw reservation you should seek interview with Nuri, and point out that the result of withdrawing it would be that bombs could not be used in the event of disorder in northern Iraq, and that Iraqi government would thus be forced to rely mainly upon ground forces, employment of which proved to be ineffective in the cane of rebellions of Sheikh Mahmud and Barsan.

It covers the attitude of the Iraqi and Afghan governments towards the use of air power in, or adjacent to, their territory. There is also some examination of the use of air power by France against ‘dissidents’ in Morocco (see folios 46-49) and by the Soviet Union against ‘dissidents’ in Turkmenistan; a translation of a propaganda pamphlet dropped by Soviet aircraft over Turkoman villages during August 1933 can be found on folios 54-56. The file also contains an account examining the reasoning and purpose behind the British bombing of the Indian village of Kotkai in August 1933: see folios 32-38. The discussion takes place against the background of the Geneva Disarmament Conference (1932-1934).The file includes translated extracts from the
                           Islah, which are included to illustrate reporting that the Foreign Office perceives to be damaging to Britain: see folios 6-7, 27-28, and 40-41. Extracts from the
                           Birmingham Post(folio 16), the

                           News Chronicle(folio 20) have also been included.The main correspondents are as follows: HM Minister at Kabul (Richard Roy Maconachie), HM Representative at Baghdad (George Arthur Ogilvie Forbes, Acting Counsellor, and Francis Henry Humphrys, Ambassador), officials at the Foreign Office and other British diplomatic representatives. The correspondence is periodically forwarded to the Under-Secretary of State for India by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; very little correspondence in this file directly involves the India Office.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
