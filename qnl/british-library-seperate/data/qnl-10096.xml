The correspondence mentions consultations with the United State's State Department, and the reasons for making joint Anglo-American plans to coordinate the extension of the territorial waters of various Arab Gulf states. Many of the letters discuss this as both a response to Iranian ambitions in the Gulf, and as a cautionary measure so as to avoid conflict between American and British oil interests in the region. Of note are several discussions on the choice of terminology to describe the marine territory in question, such as sovereignty versus jurisdiction.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Sea bed mining</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum industry</topic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial waters</topic></subject><subject><topic>Bilateral relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000116#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000116#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000116#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
