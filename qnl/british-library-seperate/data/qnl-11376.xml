The document is also signed by Harold Fenton Jacob, First Assistant Resident in Aden. The Treaty seeks to unite the British Government and the Idrisi Saiyid against Turkish [Ottoman] incursions in Aden and Yemen more generally. Though the main focus of the document is the provision of diplomatic and moral support, paragraph 7 of the Treaty confirms that the British Government will support the Idrisi against Turkey through the supplication of 'funds and munitions'.The Treaty is prefaced by two letters: one signed by various government officials including the Viceroy of India, and one written by David George Levigne Shaw. Both letters provide their opinions on the Treaty.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Idrīsī Imām of ʻAsīr</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>International relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arms sales</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00028e#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00028e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
