Section 3. ■' [E 760/233/25] Na 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received February 8.) (No. 16.) HIS Majesty s Minister at Jedda presents bis compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit to him copy of his note to His Royal Highness the Saudi Arab Minister for Foreign Affairs, of the 11th January. 1933. respecting mutual recognition between Transjordan and Saudi Arabia. Jedda, January 11. 1933. Enclosure in No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to the Saudi Arab Minister for Foreign Affairs. (After compliments.) Your Royal Highness, Jedda, January 11. 1933. WITH reference to the memorandum which his Excellency the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs was good enough to communicate to His Britannic Majesty's Charge d’Affaires in his letter of the 12th Jumada II, 1351 (the 13th October. 1932), and to my recent conversations with his Excellency, I have now the honour to communicate to your Royal Highness the following statement of the views and suggestions of my Government regarding the proposed settlement between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Amirate of Transjordan : — His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have learnt with satis faction of the readiness of His Majesty the King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to adopt their suggestion that His Majesty and the Amir of the State of Trans jordan should mutually recognise each other, as a preliminary to the general settlement which it is hoped to bring about between the two countries. They particularly appreciate the terms in which this readiness has been expressed. They suggest that the most appropriate procedure would be that the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia and the Chief Minister of the Transjordan Government should address notes to His Majesty's representative at Jedda and His Majesty's High Commissioner for Transjordan respectively, requesting them to notify His Majesty's Government of the decision of each ruler and his Government to recognise the other, with an intimation that the recognition will take effect automatically on receipt of confirmation from His Majesty's Govern ment that a similar note has been received from the other side. If this procedure be accepted. His Majesty’s Government would propose to communicate simul taneously to each of the two Governments an authenticated copy of the note received from the other. The date of this communication would be fixed before hand in agreement with them and the recognition would take effect as from that date. His Majesty's Government have received with equal satisfaction the assurance of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz that he is prepared to enter into treaty negotiations with the Government of Transjordan as soon as mutual recognition has taken place. With regard to the condition attached to this assurance, they desire to state that, under article 5 of the agreement of the 20th February, 1928, between the United Kingdom and Transjordan, His Highness the Amir undertook to be guided by the advice of His Britannic Majesty in all matters affecting the foreign relations of Transjordan. Having regard to this article and their special position in regard to Transjordan, His Majesty’s Government consider themselves responsible for ensuring the fufilment by the Amir and his Government of international obligations contracted by them. They regard it as natural in the circumstances that they should take part in the [711 h—3]2 | fJommun aid be adc negotiations for a treaty settlement between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan and i Under £ when that settlement is effected they will be prepared to take any necessary steps CoL( in accordance with the principle laid down in the preceding sentence, to secure respect for its provisions on the part of Transjordan. the foll(n His Majesty’s Government trust that the foregoing statement will dissipate. l&gt;s anv doubt which may exist in the mind of His Majesty King Abdul Azid regarding the future effect of the settlement at which it i^ hoped to arrive. They will be prepared, if necessary, to confirm the statement in an exchange of notes between the Government of ^saudi Arabia and themsel\es simultaneously with the conclusion of the proposed agreement between the latter and the Government of Transjordan. They suggest that, if His Majesty King Abdul Aziz and his Government are in agreement with their proposals, the question of mutual recog nition should be disposed of forthwith on the lines indicated in paragraph 1 of this memorandum and that arrangements should then be made with the least possible delay to proceed with the further negotiations. In conveying the foregoing statement to your Royal Highness, I have the honour to express the strong hope that it will meet the views of His Majesty the King and his Government. I shall not fail to communicate their reply to m Government with the least possible delay after it is received.

He suggested they should he completed here in single stage. I replied that I personally saw no objection to attempt being made to do this but that I foresaw great danger of negotiations being unduly protracted in probaole event of difficult questions arising which v/ould require elaborate study in consultation with higher authorities. I suggested the best plan might be to endeavour to complete negotiations here on definite though infoimal understanding that if difficulties which I foresaw should prove excessive there should be no rupture but merely suspension of discussions and to leave the question where and when they should be resumed to be considered by delegates at the moment of suspension 6 I promised to take your instructions. I recommend the above solution although it is open to objection out Transjordan delegates may be delayed here rather longer than we had intended. I would do my best to avoid any undue prolongation by insisting on necessity for suspension if£ 0 if we were tVieatened with great delay« If you agree to the above I should like soon to pro pose definite date for beginning of negotiations on assumption that mutual recognition ought to be completed by say April 10th c High Commissioner will doubtless advise on v/hole subject after considering possible trans port arrangements and possibility of some dislocation of ordinary services owing to pilgrimage.

Secondly : The Government of His Majesty think it necessary that the two parties should see the official text of the formula by which mutual recognition will be accomplished, and they would like to draw attention to the fact that the recognition by Transjordan should be explicitly that of the feaudi Arab Kingdom comprising the Hejaz and Nejd and its dependencies. Thirdly : In view of the confidence which the Government of His Majesty have in the British’Government, they agree to their proposal as to the conclusion of a treaty between them (the Saudi Government) and Transjordan, subject to the guarantee (dhamana) of, the British Government of the fulfilment of the undertakings of Transjordan (implemented) by (their) taking part in the negotia tions, on the ’one hahd, and by the exchange of official notes on the other, as has been explained in the above-mentioned British note. Fourthly : The Government of His Majesty also consider that the exchange of recognition officially between the two Governments should be accompanied b\ an exchange of telegrams, from the Shereef Abdullah to His Majesty the King and His Majesty’s reply thereto. . . . . Fifthly: As regards the manner of communicating the recognition, the Government of His M!a]estv will communicate the necessaiy text to the British Plenipotentiary at Jedda and will receive through his intermediary the Tians- jordan text. . . . . with highest resnects.

Draft Treaties of ^Fr iendship and Bon Voisinage and Extradition, based upon those concluded between the Iraq and Saudi Arabia, were drawn up In oonsultatlon with Sir Andrew Hyan and are transmitted herewith. The English translations of the Iraqi-Sr.udi Treaties available for exsmlnation were not entirely satisfactory, and it is important that the persons who undertake the conduct of the negotiations with the Saudi Government should be in possession of the original Arabic text. 1 shall be grateful if Your Excellency will cause copies of the original text to be obtained and sent to me as early as possible* The English of the enclosed drafts could no doubt be improved upon but as the original text will be in Arabic it does not scan necessary to spend much time COPY .

It Is agreed that the negotiations Should be divided into two stages, the first at Jeddah and the second at Jerusalem, both stages to be equally official. The i JSseellency Ihe High Commi» 8 ion«r for irans-Jordan, £AThe first stage would serve to establish contact between the negotiators and. It Is hoped, to clear a great deal of the ground preparatory to the formal conclusion of the agreements at the second stage in Jerusalem. 1 would propose that the delegation to Jeddah should be composedof myself, the Chief i Secretary to the Trans*Jordan Government, who is more suitable for the task of negotiating than the Chief Minister, and Can tain J.B. Glubb, O.B. 3. t M.C., as an expert but not, in view of Sir Andrew Ryan’e ob ject ion 3 , a del egat: . 4. The conclusion of an Extradition Treaty on the basis of that between the Iraq and Saudi Arabia will necessitate some form of agreement as to the allocation of nomadic tribes between Trans-Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Captain Glubb anticipates that it will be impossible to arrive at a definite division between the two countries of the Beni Atlya and Sherarat tribes or of sect ions of tho% tribes in view of their dispersed state. Members of various sections of the Sherarat are to be found attached more or less permanently to ether tribes of Trans-Jordan, Syria and Iraq, and the difficulty over the Beni Atiya arises over the members of the sections of that tribe who are and have been for some time past settled permanently in the Kerak District of Trans-Jordan* Captain Glubbsuggests that the difficulty i may be overcome by abstaining from any attempt to divide these particular tribes between the two countriesbut to endeavour to secure Ibn baud's assent i toi to an arrangement ohoreby, in settling any incident involving mem'bere of theoe tribes^ the nationality of the individual• concerned should be considered te be that of the country in which they were living at the time tde incident occurred. X consider this suggestion a practical solution of the problem. It would appear preferable that this arrangement and the allocation of the other tribe* which should present no insuperable difficulty, should be secured by means of letters to be exchanged between the negotiators and annexed to the Treaties. 5. Should the evidence furnished in accordance with the requirements of Article 4 of the Extradition Treaty be considered insufficient to Justify the trial of the accused* had the offence been coioaitted in Trane*Jordan* extradition would not be granted* Xt may, in the circumstances* be advisable to mention in the Treaty that any application for extradition will be dealt with in accordance with the law in force in the territory from where extradition la sought. I shoul/d welcome Your Excellences advice on this point. 6. I shall be grateful for instructions as to whether X can now consult the Trans*Jordan Government and endeavour to secure their agreement to the present drafts as a basis for negotiations and to the proposed procedure for negotiations* I have, etc., (TSgd.)

Captain Glubb.mmsmi- Memorandum for His ixcellency the ilifth Oonmippioner, on Sir A. tynn f s interview with the Amir Abdullah on February 16th,19^3. The Amir Abdullah had Colonel Gox and myself to luncheon immediately on ay arrival at Amman on February 16th. I had not intended to discuss business unless the Amir took the initiative* After the usual compliments he evinced a clear desire for discussion. He referred to the assurance he had e'iven to Your Hhtcellency some months ago and said that he intended to abiae by it and to conform completely with the wishes of His Majesty’s Government in regard to his relations with Ibn (Baud. I thought it well to make a general statement of a purely personal kind at this stage, especially as Colonel Cox had told that His Highness had asked whether my visit here was due to any complication. The following is a condensed summary of my statement. 2. I said that both His Majesty’s Government and I greatly appreciated the assurance which he had given to you and needed no confirmation of hie intention to abide by it. He had expressed his views very frankly a year ago when I spoke to him about the desirability of hie recognising Ibn Saud. Various events intervened and he had modified the attitude he took up at that time. I attached the same value to what he had iusttold me as I had done to his (to me) leas agreeable but candid statement in February,1932. He had expressed in connection with his assurance of last autumn certain desiderata une was that recognition should be mutual; another that it should be followed by a treaty of friendship. Neither Hie Majesty's Government nor I, I said, had ever contemplated anything except a recognition which should be mutual. It was also : v -5: : mmmmalso entirely in accordance with the views of His Majesty^ Government that there should be a treaty, which should be negotiated after the completion of the mutual racopnition. The Amir could rest assured that His Majesty^ Government desired a settlement which would fully safepuard his position. I would not fro into His Highness 1 other desiderata, which were of a less purely political nature, unless he hiuFulf wished to speak about thorn. 3. This point having been reached, I went on, there remained only questions of procedure, which required to be carefully worked out to ensure satisfactory results. The sole object of my visit to Jerusalem and Arnsn was to concert the details of the procedure with yourself and Colonel Cox. Our conclusions v/ould most appropriately be laid before His Highness by the Resident, while it would be for me to follow them up with the Raudi Government. 4. The Amir re-affirmed his intention of being guided by His Majesty's Government and his desire to put all rancour out of his heart once he had promised to recognise Ibn Saua. He spoke of his other desiderata under three heads as follows:- (a) . ro; o rti?a in t he H.gj az. To aprood that an this question concerned other members of the Hashemite family it would not be dealt with in a treaty between Trans-Jordan and I expressed the personal view that the treaty negotiations might provide a favourable opportunity for dealing with it as a side i^sue to their main purpose. (b) qj tJrc.iju c . U ..gai&gt;,jwW, ifl JiaudU-g'Ma- The Amir wished that the settlement should ensure the good treatment of his subjects. He did not define his meaning i would not be T MSaudi-Arabia. moremore precisely. I confined myself to saying that the Question of dealing with this matter in a treaty was delicate but promised to keep his wishes well in mind. {c ^ li ght of Hlrrlmn^ . The Amir spoke of the need for some assurance that he, as a Mofleii, would enjoy the ripht of all Moslems to visit the Holy Oities. I said that I did not think this would present any difficulty once proper relations had been established, as Ibn Saud applied consistently even in the case of possibly enbarrassinp visitors, the principle that no Moslem could be denied access as a pilprim to the Holy Places. Moreover he treated such visitors when they came with the honour due to their rank. I pave as an instance the case of ex-King Amounallah. It emerged from further conversation that what the Amir was after was some sort of affinflation of his ripht,, for the sake of his honour, though he did not think it lively that hsxwould wish to use it. 1 said that in my opinion some such affirmation might be obtainable. (I think that this matter might without too much difficulty be dealt with in letters attached to the Treaty of Fri endship bo). 5 . At this point the Amir said spontaneously that he was willing to get on with the treaty and postpone questions (a) and (cl. 1 said that we could best judge in the course of negotiations whether to bring them into the settlement now contemplated or reserve them for solution later. 6 . 1 would ask Your Excellency to send copies of this record to the Colonial Office and to Jedua.

Following my preliminary conversation with the High Commissioner I discussed various matters during my visit to Amman. As the discussions were very lengthy I will record only the main points with occasional comments, under the following heads. to $$tabX i-n.ll between the Mere and (rOverni&gt;ients of Saudi Arabia and Trans-Jordan. 2. As a result of my exchange of views with Mr.Young and Colonel Cox, I dropped my idea of attempting to substitute a more direct procedure for that proposed in my note of January llth to the Saudi (rovemnent. I do not consider that the last paragraph of their reply of January 22 nd constitutes aclear acceptance of the procedure proposed by Hie Majesty’s Government but it can be taken as implying acceptance. Colonel Cox and I agreed C to the formula attached at A, subject to a strong view on the part of Colonel Cox that the Amir should not be asked to use the underlined definition of ft Saudi Arabia” which would be most repugnant to him and which was otiose as the Saudi Government have themselves published a decree defining what ’’Saudi Arabia” meant. 3 . I foresee a good deal of difficulty if we do not defer to the wish of the Saudi Government to have the definition inserted and I see some risk if we do not no so, of our becoming involved in discueeion as to the real meaning of ''Saudi frabia'. Such discussion, if pursued, might raise questions which His Majesty's Government would preferprefer to S 7 oid # riz,those relative to Asir and to frla? n and Aqaba. It has now occurred to me as a posFible compromise that the underlined words night be replaced by the words 'as defined in His Majesty’s decree of (Date of decree of last September rer^arding the adoption of the new name!'. 4 . Colonel Oox demurs to the Saudi suggestion that the telegrams to follow on the completion of recognition should take the form of a telegram from the Amir and a reply from Ibn Baud. He thinks the telegrams should be simultaneous and identic. I consider this reasonable, though not to my mind imperative, as the parties are of unequal status. &lt;6 agreed on the formula attached at B. 5 . It is important that I should be able to forge ahead with the Saudi So Vermont as soon as possible after ay return to Jedda. As the texts will actually be in Arabic I must either take them or await their arrival by beg, sometimes a matter of weeks. Colonel Oox agreed to have Arabic versions made at once of the two formulae and it was suggested that the/ might be discussed with the Amir ■ bdullah during his visit this week-end to the High Commissioner. They will also need the approval of His Majesty’s Crovernment but it was not thought that this need delay action with the Amir, as His Majesty’s Government are unlikely to take excep tion to the formulae. * .‘laoe of 3ub_pjm )»nt Treaty 6 . Ni final canclunon was reached on this question but there appeared to be a general concensus of opinion in fbvour of the aurrrestion that the negotiations should be ■in two stages, the first in Jedda, to ooia; are views as to the modifications necessary to adopt the Saudi-Iraoi texts, and the second in Jerusalem. This is mib f l^ ii ^ i ,j|f or t . 1 g ghOoBWip^ioner 1 s considered view as to whether the heated Arab-political atnoe; here of Jerusalem would ma e it unsuitable. My impression as regards potential Baud! negotiators is that in conducting negotiations of the kind in view they would not allow themselves to be influenced much, even in Jerusalem, by outside Arab politicians and would not abuse the opportunities for publicity, thourh they mipht well consort a good deal in a general way with Arab political circles. 7 . I have one comment still to make on the ?t two stage' proposal as defined by His Majesty’s Government. I see no reason why the first stage should be treated as informal. One object being to consider Ibn Saud’s susceptibilities as senior party, I consider that both stapes should be represented as eoually ofiicisl. 8 . I attach at G a record of a personal conversation with ?uad Bey on February 9th which bears mainly on this &gt;- subject. ^ 9. Colonel Cox and I tried to get a rough idea of a possible time-table. Mutual recognition and other preliminaries can hardly be completed before the end of March. Thir brings us up against the pilrrimape (April 41 and ensuing festival. The first stage must probably be left until about md-'pril at the earliest. It should be possible to limit it to the inside of a fortnight in Jedda. If six weeks be than allowed for consultation, the second stage might begin about mid-.Tune in Jerusalem. tyatura of Tran a-Iardan ,r 9 nr&lt;lMflta,tJoa. Id. opinion in high circles at Amman has been moving in favour of a delegation consisting of Colonel Cox ana the Amir's Chief Secretary, Towfiq Bey Abul Huun. The presentpresent Chief Minieter is considered incapable of such a Job. Colonel Cox suggested, however, that if there is to be an extradition treaty from which he is averse, it mi$it be better to m*dce Captain Clubb the British delegate as so much will turn on expert knowledge of tribes and the means of determining nationality. I expressed the view that we were so committed to the general Iraqi model, that we could not with any prospect of success (or indeed with good faith) avoid an extradition treaty. I suggested that in any case the appointment of Captain Glubb as a general negotiator would excite a false impression on the Saudi side, thou^a his use as an expert would be very natural. I considered his appointm^ nt undesirable for another reason vis. that he would be technically junior to Towfiq Bey. My idea was that both Colonel Cox and Captain Glubb should go to Jedda for the first stage which I hope to limit as above and that Captain Glubb should be called to Jerusalem as required during the second stage. recognition and negotiations. 11 . The telegram from London on this subject istenishes me. X cannot conceive that I bn &amp;aud ■would look viih favour on such an idea and X should expect him to he specially hostile to a meeting with the Amir in Jerusol«i« 1 do not think that the Idea should he pursued in any way unless it oan he ascertained that the SJaudi Sinister in London was speaking with knowledge of the mind of his King. If he was, the idea mirfit he turned to account in some way, though I should myself prefer not to let it eemplloate the present programme. Colonel Cox agrees. Since seeing him I have thou&lt;trt of another objection viz. that a failure of the negotiations after a personal meeting would he more spectacularspectacular than If no such meeting had taken place* Wpuld it not he hotter to keep the possibility of a meeting of rulers up our sleeves as a means of repairing the effects of a failure to achieve a settlement hy the treaty nego tiations now in view? Poreona .i&amp;cuaed of 12 * 1 did not go into the details of the question of conspirators outside the Amir 1 * immediate entourage. 1 verified up to date the list of persons excluded hy name from Trans-Jordan. The six names on this list are the same as six out of seven given me in Cairo, the seventh person on the Cairo list being one of the ABU nj&lt;pT&lt;lA 8 . Colonel Cox was practically certain that the list of persons excluded from Palestine was the same as for Trans- Jordan. I emphasized the desirability of making the exclusion orders effective and of restricting hy all possible means the movements of conspirators. 1 cited the case of Abdur Baouf Sabban who, having been dismissed and relegated to Iraq, left for Baghdad at his own con venience on November 28th, was in Jerusalem on December 17th, and subsequently turned up in Kgypt. Colonel Cox told me that this man had gone back to Iraq via Byria, having been refused permission to pass through Trans-Jordan. 13. I discussed more closely the question of the hnir Shaker and Hamid Pasha el Wadi. My riew was that there could be no reasonable doubt of their guilt. I agreed that it might be difficult to convict them in a court of law but urged that no public or high commercial person t e anywhere en joyed security of tenure on that ground, if He was seriously oomproaisod in connexion with undesirable activities. I explained how difficult it had been to defend in Jedda the apparent tolerance shewn to these two personspersons especially sines the meeting at the Hotel Moderns, Jerusalem, on Horember 15th* X expressed the Ties that the two oases Should not be considered from the point of Yiew of the existence of legal proof but from that of policy. 1 considered that, if there were serious reasons of policy for retaining one or both of the personages con cerned, it would be much better to tell the Saudi GoYern- ment that we could not ask the Amir to dismiss his cousin nd his chamberlain* It would be easier to take this line in the case of -haker than of Hamid, though in both oases I should be embarrassed at h&amp;Ylng to brazen it out* 14* Colonel Cox was inclined on balance to think the political reasons for maintaining Shaker more cogent than those for dismissing him* He was most concerned to de precate any idea of confronting Shaker and Hamid with the evidence in the first instance* He thought that, even if their complicity be regarded as certain, they could elude the evidence by plausible answers* He though5 that His Majesty v s Government should decide, without this inter mediate step, whether to have one or both of these two mei dismissed or to let them be maintained* As regards sene considerations in favour of standing by Ghaker nothing important emerged from the discussion, exc-rpt that neithe, Colonel Cox nor Captain Glubb now attach any value to the survival of the Bcduin Control Board. 15* Colonel Cox and his colleagues had been ad work on this and had drafts ready. In the main I agreed, except that I suggested a still closer adhesion to the ireqi models as regards order and fern* It *** unfortunate that we had only an apparently rather loose Knglish translation to work on. It is very desirable that several xabic text* should be procured e.g* f*e» Bagdad, ^o hammered out Dyaft Treaties * three(g) three drafta which Colonel Cox will submit. I had hoped to offer detailed comments before leaving Jerusalem but am prevented by indisposition. I may aay that I agree generally though not perhaps at every point to the joint draft ae a basis of preliminary discussion, subject to legal opinion on the form of certain articles* Natl onallty . 16. Everybody agrees that the treaties will give rise to controversy and may be positively dangerous,especially an extradition treaty, unless means can be found to settle disputes on nationality like that about the A.tun. Captain Glubb is still much impressed by the difficulty of assigning tribes *nd/or sections of tribes to one party or the other, especially as there is a constant trend on the part of tribes to move north and settle, ^ny allocation agreed to now might be unsuitable even three years hence, I suggested that as the Saudis will certainly raise this question, we should attempt a rough allocation to be embodied in lettej annexed to the Treaty of friendship with a caveat in favour of its temporary character and that we should try to make disputes not soluble under this allocation matters of arbitration. Captain Glubb has an alternative plan of making 'nationality” dependent largely on length of sojourn but X did not note the details. Colonel Cox will doubtless report further. .TUfl affair. 17 . Some discussion passed ubout this and other olaii in respect of raids from August 1, 193° February 195X, which continued to be outstanding since last January when Captain Glubb and I bn ' eyd met. The details are not material to the main subject of this memorandum. (3gd.) AX DREW iYAH. •ruealem, February 15th, 1933*SHCLOJtUS III y* IXT'Ud oy iacoaNITIOM.

Colonel Cox, British Heaident, Amaan. Mr* Young, Chief Secretary* Sheikh Fuad el Khatib to translate* Private Secretary* Hia iSaccellenoy said that there were three matters which he wished to discuss: (1) The question of mutual recognition between His Highness and I bn Gaud, to be followed by Treaties of Bon Voiain&amp;ge and Extradition* (2) The position of Hamid Pasha el Wadi and Amir Shaker* ( 3 ) The question of the proposed lease of the Amir’s land and of the entry of settlers into Trans-Jordan. I* A s regards mutual recognition which His Excellency had first suggested to His Highness last September, His Excellency said that Colonel Cox had shewn him the draft of the proposed letter from the Chief Minister of Trans-Jordan to the High Commissioner and also the draft of the proposed telegram to be sent by His Highness to I bn Saud after he had been Informed by Hia Majesty’s Government that mutual recognition had taken place.Ills Excellency said he entirely approve of the proposed procedure and of these drafts and was very glad to hear that His Highness was ready to fall in with the proposed proeedure. The formula of recognition having been approved he was sure that mutual recognition would be speedily arranged. jiow that the difficulties in the way of recognition were in a fair way to settlement, it was intended to proceed with the draft Treaties of Bon Voisinage and Extradition, and Colonel Cox would die- cuss these with His Highness as soon as possible. Kis Sixcellency said he would like to explain ilia?; the visit of Sir Andrew Kyan had been made with the object of discussing the formula of recognition and subsequent procedure; he thought that the preliminary discussion with him had been useful# His iSxcellency asked whether His Highness had nyihing to say on these two matters. HAs.Hi&amp;h&amp;ess said that he had agreed to His Kxoellency’s proposals in September and he quite accepted what was now proposed. He had seen the dr .ft letter and the draft telegram and had nothing to say. HIjl lixoeil enoy said that at the conclusion of the matter he would like to say how gratfied he was that His Highness had accepted his advice and that he felt quite confident that recognition and the proposed treaties would be of advantage to Trans-Jordan. He had already mentioned to His Highness that he had informed the British Government at home how gratified he was by the attitude which His Highnoso had taken in this matter.II* As regards the position of Hamid Pasha el Wadi, His i&amp;oelleaoy said that he had heard that morning from 'olonel '-'Ox that Hamid Pasha had been elected Deputy in the Iraq Mejlis. Hie Excellency presumed, therefore, that he would cease to hold the post of Hals ®1 Dlwan to the Amir and would shortly leare Amman to take up his new duties in Iraq. This was a semi-official Meting, hut speaking e confidentially, His Excellency said he would like to interpose this word of friendly advice to His Hi^mess namely, that he thought that it would he for the good of the country if Hamid Pasha resided in Iraq and not in Trans-Jordan. As regards the Amir Shaker, His Highness would probably know th it certain rumours had been circulating regarding his conduct. His Hirhnoss knew His Excellency well enough to be sure that he did not accept rumours as facts, but he could not but be cognisant of these rumours and he thought it only fair to the Amir -'-baker that Colonel Cox should Inform the Amir Shaker of these rumours and give him an opportunity to reply to them. His Excellency asked whether His Highness had any remarks to make on these two matters. Kja Highness said that Hamid Pasha el VVadi an old friend of his who had served in the Orerit War with him and he could not look on him except as his friend and as an hone at man in all his dealings. Hs could not however deny th^t people sometimes committed mistakes. Of course as he had been elected to the Iraq Mejlis Hamid Pasha would proceed to Iraq. He would like to mention, however, that this election had taken place without His Highness having been informed beforehand and he was a little displeased at it. His Highness certainly believed th j t Hamid i aaha intendedIntended to go to Iraq. Ab regards the Mir, Shaker, he wa? a member of H 1 b Hi^ineoa^ own family and one of the leading figures In the Arab Herolt. Mot only was the Amir Shaker an intimate friend but a member of the family of which he was the head in Tran eh* Jordan. He would, therefore, prefer that Colonel Cox should speak to him and not to the Amir Shaker. Hi a acellency said that His Hiidmess acknowledged that Hamid Pasha had made certain mistakes and he was ^ad to hear that he would cease to be Rais el Diwan. As regards the Amir Shaker His Excellency was quite content to accept His Hi^mess’s suggestion that Colonel Cox should first tell His Highness what the rumours were and than see the Amir Shaker. His Kljdmega said that after discussing the rumours together he and Colonel Cox would decide who should oomunicate with the Amir Shaker, Aether His Bigness or Colonel Cox. 143 ; xce^lency made it plain that Colonel Cox I j must see the Amir Shaker* He was quite willing that the question should be discussed first with His Hi^mess but Colonel Cox must them see the Amir Shaker himself* Hi a Kirhneas thought that he and Colonel 0 together should decide what matters it was worth while to put before the Amir Shaker. Colonel Cox could see the Amir Shaker any day but His Highness thought that he should be consulted before this formal confronts!ion. His Excellency repeated that Colonel Cox might certainly inform His Highness what the rumours were, but after that he must carry out the Hi.&lt;h Commiooioner , s instructions and see the Amir shaker himself.lila iUKhneae asked why then was he Informed of this matter? His xjtoeUenoy replied that it was because he thou$it it only right that His Highness should know that thee© rumours were in existence.

We also decided to abandon proposal that Shaker should be confronted by British Resident with a statement of facts which have caused suspicion to fall on him and required to answer charges. We agreed however that a warning should be given by Cox to Shaker and on being assured that His Majesty’s Government approves this course and that Sinker has been warned Ryan considers he will be able to dispose of demand which has been made by Saudi Government that Shaker shall be dismissed and that preliminaries for negotiating the Treaty will start under as favourable conditions as could be hoped for.

Your 19 Secret of 14th February 1933 relating to a suggested meeting in Jerusalem between Abdullah and Ibn Saud, Ryan’s advice is that the idea should not be pursued unless it can be ascertained that Minister for South Arabia in London was apeal.ing with knowledge of the King’s mind. If such was the case the idea mighu be turned to account in some way but it would be preferable not to let it complicate present programme. Another objection is ;suggested by Ryan namely that a failure of negotiations after a personal nee'oing would be more spectacular than :.f no such meeting had taken place.

X would suggest that in addition to the other subjects which will be discussed during Sir Andrew Ryan's forthcoming visit to Jerusalem, you should take the opportunity to discuss with him the general lines of procedure* In the light of that discussion you would then, it is hoped, be able to submit to me agreed recommendations• 2. This question of procedure has received preliminary consideration in consultation with the foreign Office, as a result of a telegram from Sir Andrew Byan raieing the question of the place of the treaty negotiations, and pointing out the serious obstacle to the negotiations which would be constituted by delay necessitated by consultation between the various authorities concerned. It is tentatively ouggested that the following procedure would tend to obviate this difficulty. (a) As the Saudi Government contemplate that the treaty settlement with xrana-Jofcdan should t^e the form ijMtmfiaaxoMR, lEUmiAST GiJ&amp;iRAL, JIB A.G. WAUCKORS, C.L.G., C .1 JS ., D.o.U., etc •, etc ®tc •form of a treaty of friendship and bon voisinage and an extradition treaty on the lines of thnae concluded by them with Iraq in April, 1931, I suggest that both documents should be examined in consultation v/ith Sir Andrew Ryan during his visit to Jerusalem with a view to determining prima facie how far, or with what modifications, they would form a suitable basis for treaty negotiations between Trans-Jordan and Saudi** Arabia. Copies of these documents were enclosed in my secret despatch 2 of the 21st July, 193/*. • The conclusion of an extradition treaty presupposes a solution oi the difficulty ox the allocation of the nomad tribes between Trans-Jordan and Seudi-Arabia. In this connection I would invite reference to your secret despatch *A tt of the 10th September, 1932. In view of the exclusion from Trans- Jordan of an important section of the Jeni &lt;vtiya, it seems possible that a solution on the lines suggestea by Colonel Peake in sub-enclosure 1 to your despatch under isference might be reconsidered. (b) 4hen the preliminary study of the Iraqi tretfiee has been completed, you would presumably consult the Trans-Jordan Government, and a possible adopted thereafter alght be for the Chief Klnieter of Trans-Jordan:, as representing the Trans-Jordan Government, to proceed to Jedda with the British Besident or the Assistant British Resident, to discuss with Hie Majesty's Minister and with a representative of the Saudi Government, in order to common ground could be reached regarding the substance of both treaties. His Majesty's Minister no the British Hesident, or the Assistant British Keoioe.it, wouldwould together represent the mediating influence of Hia Majesty*a Government. The proceedings at thia stage might conveniently be of a somewhat informal character* (c) On the conclusion of these discussions and after an interval for further reference by both sides to their respective Governments, a more formal meeting could be arranged at Jerusalem at which the final text of the two treaties would, it is hoped, be agreed upon* At Jerusalem the difficulty regarding consultation referred to in the first part of this paragraph would be minimised, and King Ibn daud might, it is thought, agree to the meeting being held there if the preliminary meeting were held at Jedda. 3 * If it is found possible to hold the second meeting at Jerusalem* the negotiations might be presided over by yourself (Mr. Young could represent you when you were not available); Tr&amp;ns-Jordan intercuts and mandatory interests in Trans-Jordan being represented respectively by the Chief Minister, and by the British Resident or the Assistant British ieaident, as might be convenient.

In forwarding this correspondence to me Colonel Peake wrote as follows:- 'I entirely agree with Az Zaim Glubb Bey that, it would be a fatal thing to show Ibn Saoud my Hote on Nationality of tribes or to make any arrangement with him with regard to this difficult question, aa we should be bound by the arrangement and he would not. My Note was written with the sole idea of giving suggestions, entirely for our own use in case of necessity, but as I must again say with no idea of being communicated to Ibn ‘jaoud. 4 .

The Excellency, he High Commisaioner for Trans-Jordan, JERUSALEM.The raids mentioned in that letter as perpetrated by the Beni Atiya, who had come into Trans-Jordan, have been shown to be the work of men camped hundreds of miles away in Hejd and the wioked policy attributed therein to the Trana-Jordan Government in allowing the Beni Atiya to enter Trans-Jordan was in reality a humane recognition of the fact that the Beni Atiya must mo/e Horth for grazing and a recognition of the difficulties, amounting almost to impossibility, of preventing a grazing tribe with its women and children from doing so. 5 . I consider that the Minister’s proposal that a decision should be taken regarding the nationality of the Beni Atiya should be resisted, for to reach such a decisioriwould afford no solu/tion of the difficulty. It * • would put us at some time or other in the position oi breaking a promise to Ibn Saoud or 0 -^ oeing obliged to use force with a tribe accompanied by their women and children who would not leave our territory since they realise that to do so would mean the starvation of their animals. I have, etc., (Signed) Cox BRITISH R33IDKHT.SUGGESTIONS EOS DETERMINING THE NATIONALITY OF BBDWIN TRIBES. During the disouasion on Bedwin affairs with Sir Andrew Ryan the question of the Nationality of Bedwin tribes was brought up but no conclusion was come to. One of the difficulties appeared to be that the word NATIONALITY in its European sense applied to an individual, and was not, therefore, applicable to a Bedwin tribe. This is true, but in the absence of a more suitable word, there appears to be no reason why, in the case of Bedwin tribes it should not apply to a tribe. The old English word 'fealty', meaning allegiance to a superior, would appear to be applicable. I am of opinion that there is a formula on which the Nationality of a tribe oan be based, since tribes are commonly spoken of as belonging to a certain country. If there is no formula, there is no reason why the Buallah should bo called a -yr an trioe, the Azazmeh, a Palestine, or the Haiwat a Sinai tribe etc. I would, therefore, suggest that (1) The nationality of a tribe be based upon the country in which the main part of its ordinarily recognised DIRA is situated. ( 2 ) That the country in which the town or village is situated, where from Turkish days or earlier, the tribe is accustomed to go to petition the Government, should also assist to decide the nationality. ForFor examples of (1) the Ban! Sukhr is a Trans-Jordan tribe since the main part of its DIilA. is in that country - similarly the Azazmeh is a Palestine tribe and the Haiwat a Sinai or Egyptian tribe. The Beni Atiya is, if this system be adopted, a Hijaz tribe, and this point is strengthened in their case by the fact that in Turkish times the Beni Atiya were paid for guarding the Hijaz Railway from RAMLEH Station to MUAEZAM, that is, 2 stations in Trans-Jordan and 14 stations within the modern Hijaz boundary. From condition ( 2 ) the same nationality would be attached to the tribes mentioned, as under condition (1). Thus the Beni Sukhr look to Amman, the Azazmeh to Bir Sheba and Eaiwat to El Arish and the Beni Atiya to Tebuk. The only tribe which cannot be defined in this way is the Sherarat as they have no DIRA, and are scattered among the tribes. For this case I would suggest, that any Sherarat, who are living with another tribe, automatically for the period they are living with that tribe, be assumed to have adopted its Nationality. Under Bedwin Law the host is responsible for the acts of his guest and the master for his servant. In cases where the Sherarat are living together in a camp or camps and are obviously not mere guests or servants of other tribes, then they should be reckoned to be a Nejd or Wadi Sirhan tribe since JOF conforms more to the conditions of (2) that any town or village in Trans-Jordan. AA further exception must also he mentioned, and that is the case of individuals or sections of a trihe who own cultivated land in any country, and cultivate it themselves, The Nationality of these people or sections should be of the country in which \ their land is situated. Thus the Beni ATIYA own some land in Kerak and some of this tribe always live there. Sheikh Salim Abu Bmeikhopes to get land in Kerak^ these persons owning lands and cultivating it would, I suggest, be of Trans-Jordan Nationality in its European sense. (Signed) E.G, Peake A1 ^ariq, Officer Commanding, Arab Legion.Officer Commanding, Arab Legion, Amman. Your ALC/ 33 / 32 , dated 12 . 3 . 32 ., with attached note on the definition of the nationality of Bedwins:- I agree with the contents of your note as the best definition of nationality possible and have really no comments to make except to express certain fears regarding the whole question. These may be summed up as follows: Doubtful Tribes :&gt; The only really doubtful tribes between Mejd and Trans-Jordan are the Sherarat and Beni Atiya. For the Sherarat, the solution you propose is, 1 think, the best that can be suggested. Regarding Beni Atiya the case is more difficult. On the basis of responsibility for guarding the Hijaz Railway, the Beni ^.tiya as you say in Turkish times were responsible for two stations now in Trans-Jordan, and fourteen now in Hijaz. On this basis, one seventh of the tribal area fell within what is now Trans-Jordan. Apart from this, the purely nomad Beni Atiya have very considerable ties of custom and tradition in Kerak. (I do not here refer to the small portion of Beni Atiya permanently settled in Kerak - these are obviously Trans-Jordan subjects and are not really Bedwins at all). Whenever grazing was scarce in the Northern Eijaz in the past, the tribe was in the habit of coming up to camp in Kerak, where, even if the so-to-speak 'natural' grazing was not good, there was usuallyusually stubble to fall back on after harvest# The ^eni Atiya could not obviously be made responsible for the railway stations in the Kerak area. Thus apart from their grazing grounds, represented fairly approximately by the Railway stations, (one seventh in Trans-Jordan and six sevenths in Hijaz) they had an alternative grazing ground in Kerak, now entirely in Trans-Jordan. A certain number of them,apart from the settled ones, were nearly always to be found around Kerak, and in certain years, like the present, when no rain fell in the Eijaz, most of the tribe used to fall back on this alternative pasture area. Tribally all the Beni Atiya are now regarded by the Kerak tribes as 'cousins', (Bani ^m) while the Howeitat, a Trans-Jordan tribe, are tribally regarded in Kerak as strangers, (Ajnab). Viewing this peculiar relation with Kerak in conjunction with the fact that one seventh of their Southern area is in Trans-Jordan, X should say roundly that the Beni Atiya owe one quarter allegiance to Trans-Jordan and three quarters to Hijaz. It is not, however, possible to say that a quarter of the tribe namely, so-and-so and so—and—so are Trano-Jordaniano, They were not specific sections which camped in Keratc. The whole tribe might at certain times be near Tebuk, and the whole tribe at other times in Kerak. Of the nomad sections, the Agailat and ilubailat normally camped in the Northern Portion of the Southern grazing area, but again this was a very loose right. The springs at Mudawara, for example, tribally belongs to the Agailat section of Beni Atiya, who, if they want to camp, have the right to evict the Howeitat or other sections of the Beni Atiya. II mention these points for fear of the subsequent oomplications mentioned below. Undisputed Tribes: - How even in the case of tribes in whose case there can be no dispute, we are still on very dangerous ground. For example, Bani Sukhr, Sirhan, and Howeitat Ibn Jazi are undoubtedly Trans-Jordanians. Equally the Hijaz Anaizah, Billi, and Howeitat el Tihama are obviously Kijazians. Yet during the last 5 or 6 years, portions of all the three Trans-Jordan tribes mentioned have camped in Nejd, and portions of all the three Hijaz tribes mentioned have camped in Trans-Jordan for considerable periods, and some even in Palestine. Now there are certain hazy references in the Hadda Agreement to tribes subject to one or the other Government, although the nature of this subjection is not enlarged upon. It, however, carries obligations. For example, tribes subject to one Government may not enter the territory of the other without a permit from their own Government and so on. Now in actual practice, no attempt has ever been made to apply these conditions, Vvere such an attempt to be made, we should let ourselves in for commitments of which, at the time when the Agreement was concluded, nobody foresaw the extent. It is almost impossible to turn back a nomadic tribe in the course of a migration without the use of force and the shedding of blood. I was myself a witness of an attempt by two sections of armoured cars and co-operating aircraft* attempting to prevent the Mutair tribe from entering Kuwait. The operation took place on a vast open plain ideal for armoured oars and air operations. But the forcesforces had orders not to open fire, owing to the presence of women and children• They ordered, threatened, shouted, drove up and down, herded camels, hut to no effect whatever. The tribes simply flowed past and round and through them. It was about two months before they eventually got them out and that by diplomacy, after spending thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of pounds. And this in ideally open country. The fact is that one cannot turn back a nomadic tribe bent on migration except by shooting them down or by measures of persecution inconsistent with civilised government and probably also very costly. Now in the case of the Mutair tribe mentioned above, they had raided, looted, massacred, and I personally should not have minded shooting at them. But it is easy to imagine that, if this clause were ever enforced, Ibn Saud might demand the eviction of a tribe from Trans-Jordan merely because he weUed to tax it or in order to show toother tribes that the Government was at his beok and oall. It is true that another clause of the Hadda Agreement lays down that neither Government is bound to evict tribes or prevent their entry, by the use of force, thereby completely negativing the clause about permits. Still Ibn Saud is quite capable of demanding forcible eviction and only quite recently we have seen such a course seriously considered. I have only quoted this as one illustration to show the very imminent dangers which hedge about the whole of this question of nationality. What I fear is that your note, which seems so plain and simple, may go on to the files and some day, when a dispute arises with Ibn Saud, somebody will say, ”Oh I remember a paper on the files giving a very clear and simple rule for nationality, andand suggested by Peake Pasha himself - let us send a copy of that to Ibn 3aud. n As a result of several years experience, I believe that the whole idea of nationality in the case of * both individuals and tribes, should be completely discarded, as also should be any idea of forcible eviction or forcible denial of entry. The ideal arrangement would be for both governments so to co-operate that offenders against the peace should be equally punished in both territories. If a man camped in one territory goes out raiding he should be punished by the Government in whose territory he is camped. If he escapes into the other country, he should there receive the same punishment as he would have suffered had he been arrested by the former Government. In dealing with Ibn Saud, it must always be recollected that his system is primarily intended to keep himself on the throne, a purely political object. If one Bedwin murders another, the authorities are not particularly disturbed and the man is rarely punished. But if a Bedwin is heard to say that Ibn Saud is not a 1 ; true Muslim, he will be punished with ferocity, all bis property seized and he possibly put to death. Thus if any agreement or consent be given to extradite individuals or evict tribes, we may be certain that the demands made by Ibn Saud will be dictated by political motives, not in any attempt to punish genuine criminal offences, v/e may fi find ourselves let in for sending out Imperial forces to harry or shoot down the members of a tribe, because the Sheikh refused to pay his respects to the Amir of Jauf, or is reported to have said that the English are a Juster Government than that of Ibn Saua. These and such as tne^e&gt; are the only really unpardonable offences in Kejd. Ibn Saud in my own hearing, said in 1928 , that Kxtradition treaties were no use to him if they excluded political offences. It nay be thought that I have travelled a long way from your note, and am perhaps making a mountain out of a molehill. I quite realise that your note is not intended to be shown to Ibn Saud, but: (1) There is nothing on it to say this, and next year or the year after some new official may see it on the file and think it an excellent solution. (2) Nationality is the thin end of the wedge leading to extradition and eviction, both of which I regard, as the result of experience, with the deepest horror. None of these arrangements are applicable to the conditions. When I say this, I trust I shall not be thought to connive at raiding or disorder, in or out of Trans- Jordan. I may perhaps venture to claim that 1 have done more to suppress raiding than any man alive, in Iraq and Trans-Jordan, and even indirectly in Syria and Nejd. I am prepared to punish and recover loot, whenever reasonable or possible, from tribes entering Trans-Jordan territory, on a basis of acting against disturbers of the peace wherever found. I understand that your note is intended purely for our own guidance regarding nationality, but if nationality is a false and dangerous criterion, why do we need guidance on it ? 1 believe that we should , mete out exactly the same treatment to all Bedwin disturbers of the peace when found, regardless of 'Nationality”. •3.32.

In both cases international relations are involved: ^id it may be useful first to recapitulate the more important Instruments which govern the position. King of the Hejas and of Sejd and its DopencHiv, i ^ (now &gt;audi .._.:.-r^ql£» his Majesty the Ring has recognised Ibn Jaud as known h.d.G., Vknown iaudi Arabia) by tne treaty signed at Jedda on the 20th May, 1927, amti the relations established by certain that treaty involve/mutual obligations, notably, by Article 2, each ox’ the high Contracting Parties undertakes to maintain good relatione with the other and to endeavour by all the me^ne at his diapoaal to prevent hia territories being used as a base for unlawful activities directed against peace and tranquillity in the territories of the other party* IfitiU The relations between His Majesty 1 s Governraerit and Ir&amp;&lt;| 'dll be governed until 1957 or longer by the Treaty of 30th June, 1930, which came into force upon the entry of Iraq into the league of nations as an independent 3tate in October, 1932, The High Contracting Parties undertake that, without prejudice to obligations under the Covenant and the Treaty for the Renunciation of ^ar, in the event of either to them becoming engaged in war, the other will immediately come to his aid. The assistance which His Majesty’s Government are to render to Iraq does not extend to the maintenance of internal order, but it is recognised that the protection of the essential communications of His Majesty’s Government is in the common interest of both parties. In matters of foreign policy which may affect their common interests the High Contracting Parties agree to full and frank consultation, Hia M jeaty’s Ambassador at Baghdad, and his successors,awe to enjoy precedence in relation to the representatives of other powers, Iraq undertakesundertakes that when in need of the services of foreign Officials she will normally engage British subjects, and that for the purpose of military instruction only British subjects will be engaged* ihe relations between his Majesty*s Oovemaent and the Amir are determined by the Agreement made between Ills Majesty the /ling and His Highness in i^eurary, 1938, the ratifications of which were exchanged on the 31st October, 1929* ^ull responsibility is accepted by Hie Majesty as Mandatory for Trans-Jordan; and by Article 5 of the Agreement, the Amir agrees to be guided by the advice of His Majesty in all matters concerning foreign relations of Trans-Jordan as well as in ell matters affecting the international and financial obligations and interests of His Majesty in respect of Trans-Jordan* 4* The direct relations between gaud! Arabia and Iraq are governed by various instruments, notably the Muhamraara Convention of 5th May, 1922; the Bahra Agreement of 1 st Bovember, 1935; and the Treaty of friendship and Bon Volsln&amp;ge and the extradition Treaty of 1931. The Badda Agreement of the 2nd November, 1925, defines the frontier between Mejd and Trans-Jordan and makes provision for the settlement of certain questions connected with the frontier, with a view to promoting friendly relations between the two countries* Mo definite agreement has been reached withthe Govermaeat ot aaudl &gt; rahla aa to the definition of the frontier between Hejaa auid Trana*Jordan f but # the exchange of notes appended to the Treaty of Jedda, King Zbn SmxC has ejspressed hie willingness to maintain the status quo in the Ma f an»AqaToa district and not to interfere in its administration until favourable circumstances will permit a final settlement of the question* 5* In conformity with the general policy of His hr jesty^ Government, a further stage will hare been reached in the process of establishing these international relations on a regular basis when effect has been given to the proposed mutual recognition between Xbn ^aud as iving of iaudi Arabia, anu Abdullah as Ariir of the .it&amp;te of Tr&amp;nWordaa, which, it is contemplated, will be followed by the conclusion of a Treaty of friendship between the two countries. 6 * Turning now to another aspect of the matter, the following are the chief reasons which hare influenced His Majesty*s Gorernment in giving their support to the maintenance of Xbn Gaud* a regime in oaudi Arabia; (a) Having regard to the great concern to His Majesty*s Government of the tied &gt;ea and the Persian Gulf, to their mandatory responsibility for Trana&lt;»Jordan and their special interests in Iraq, Kuwait and .ii&amp;hreS'i, it has been recognised that it is of great advantage to His Majesty’s Government that the main area of the ArabianArabian Peninsula should be under a more or less ordered government with which they can maintain normal diplomatic relations and of Importance that those relatione should be of a friendly character. (b) Only by the establishment of such an ordered government in Arabia can the safety and good treatment of ¥. 0 adorn pilgrims, many of whom areBritiah subjects, or under British protection, be ensured. (c) Were relations between Hia M; jesty’e ueverntient fund Aing I bn Baud not of a friendly character, he might well exert himaelf to absorb Kuwait, Interfere in the affairs of Bahrein and even attempt to obtain an influence over the Trucial Bheihhdoms. There have been occasional indications that some at least of the Trucial ihei&amp;hs would not be unresponsive. (d) his Majesty^ Government would view with concern the establishment of &gt;©viet influence in Arabia. King I bn Baud has shown himaelf to be of the same view and for this reason merits support. when recently Hi a Kajesty , o Government wore unable to comply with King Ibn Baud's request for a loan, he informed them that he might be obliged, though most reluctantly, to accept Boviet offers of financial assistance. Were th* relations between His Majesty's Government and him to deteriorate, he might be readier to accept the advances of the Boviet Government • 7. As regards the support given to the Haahimite ' familyfamily in Iraq and Tr?ui*» Jordan, Hi a M^jeaty* a aovornmant hay® been irAvienoed by the following considerations:** (a) His Majesty 1 * Government recognise timt they remain under special obligations to the ii&amp;shimitea arising from the part played by the latter in the war against Turkey. (b) King feisal and the Amir Abdullah have shown themselves to be well-disposed to Hia Majesty*a Government. It ie not necessary to enter into detail, but two recent cases in which the latter has, by his co-operation, materially assisted His Majesty’s Government are the Gruse rebellion and the disturbances in Palestine in 1939. (c) His Majesty’s Government have maintained their support of the Hashisaites for many years, and there is nothing which in their view suggests the desirability of any change in a policy to which they are deeply committed On the contrary, there are special relations with Iraq, arising out of the Treaty of Alliance, which involve continued support; while in the case of Tr^na**Jordan, His Hajesty’s Government have a special responsibility, as the mandatory power, to support the rdgime which has been set up in that country under their direct protection (d) Hven if Hie fejeoty’a Government had grounds for serious dissatisfaction, there is no obvious alternative to the Hashiiaites as rulers in Iraq or Tr?ins-Jordan.8 . The possibility i» recognised that the kingdom of Ibn Uaud aaMy break up on hi** death, but it would not be to the advantage of His Majesty* a Government to do anything to hasten it® disruption# On the contrary, it is to their interest to do all that they can to maintain good relations with iaudi Arabia and to support I bn Jaud as ruler of a united kingdom. Nevertheless, account must be taken of the ssutual animosity between Xbn Gaud and the Hashimite family resulting tram past events, which cannot be expected entirely to disappear even a® a result of the establishment of relations on the basis of mutual recognition and treaties of friendship. The possibility of the continuance of disputes and of conflicting interests must be accepted, and the full reconcilis tion of the ttf© complementary aspects of the policy of His Majesty 1 e Government presents a problem, the solution of which is not without difficulty.* Support of Xbn ifoud's regime in iaudi Arabia cannot be given at the expense of support of the Uaahimite rulers In their own territories, and His Majesty*e Government must take full account of the repercussion® likely to be produced in territories over which they exercise mandatory responsibility or towards which they stand in special relations. 9. Despite, however, the existence of these difficulties, no question has arisen, nor dose the question now arise, of choosing as between Xbn Gaud and the Has him! to family, or of subordin&amp;ti g the interests of one to the other. Xf events should, unhappily, lead to that,that, a new situation would he created in which the whole position would have to be carefully reviewed* It ia not auggeated that there is IDcelihood of Bis Majesty*a Government being faced with oueh a dilemma, hattarly, however, some anxiety haa been caused in reepeet of relatione between Trane-Jordan and S&amp;udi Arabia, owing to the evidence of widespread and continuous intrigues against the 3audl regime which are believed to have bden conducted, in part at least, within Tr&amp;nsWordan itself. It is the fact that the Amir has conformed all his official acts to the requests made to him in connexion with the situation created by these intrigues* hut there are many Indications that he knew of these intrigues, even supposing that he did not encourage them, and it seems not unlikely that other persons have actively engaged in the conspiracy, and have made use of the Amir or of his name, either with or without his acquiescence, for the furtherance of subversive activities against Ibn 3&amp;uG, In consequence, a difficult, and perhaps even serious, situation has threatened to develop. 10. Much has been done already, at your instance, by the authorities in fr&amp;na-Jord&amp;n and Palestine to prevent those territories from being used as a base for Improper activities against the Saudi regime. Effective co-operation in Trana-dordan played an important part in the frustration of the Ibn Bifada revolt* This has been followed by the expulsion of an important section of the disaffected Beni Atiya, and by the exclusionfrom both JPaleatine and Transjordan of v&amp;rioua suapoeta. HoreoT«r t It Is to bo hoped that the mutual recognition of the mir Abdullah and King Xbn daud and the proposed treaty will materially improve matter®. The fact remains t however, that the existence of anti-daudi intrigue is contrary to the wishes and the interests of His Majesty’s Government; and further, having regard to their treaty obligations, and in particular those embodied in Article 2 of the Treaty of Jedda, the credit of His Majesty’s Government will be at stake if such intrigues are conducted in territory for which they are responsible• In viaw of the p^st history of Saudi Arabia, and having regard to Arab mentality, it is recognised that it ia hardly to be hoped that Intrigue against *h« Saudi regime in territories under Kashlmite rule or influence can be completely stopped; but Kis Majesty’^ Government consider it a definite owligrtioa -o l -a II measures possible to restrict this kind of activity within limits which will not constitute a throat to the stability of the Saudi regime or expose Kia Majesty’s Government to charges of indifference, if not ofaotufcl to.^ration• It is of course a corollary of this policy that Ibn should be roquired to maintain^ a correct attitude towarc« his Hashimite neighbours* XI.

HIGH C0ia,I33l0»i. Sir, Heeent events in Saudi Arabia, more particularly the Ibn Rifada incursion and the revolt in Asir, iiave suggested the desirability of reviewing the position generally, and it seems convenient to take this opportunity of re-stating the main lines of the policy which His Majesty^ Government in the United Kingdom are pursuing in regard to Arabian affairs, with special reference to 3audi Arabia, Iraq and Trans-J ordan. 2 . &lt; Briefly, this policy may be described as the maintenance of the status quo; and His Uajeety^ Government&gt;verntaent havo thus to follow two .ctin£t lines of action «► 0 support of the regime of Ihn Saud » King of Saudi Arabia, and 3 ) support of the Hashimite regime in raq and Trans-Jordan. 3 . In both oases international ilations are involved: and it may be seful first to recapitulate the ©ore aportant instruments which govern the Qsition* Saudi ^rabia. His Majesty the King has recog- ised Ibn Saud as King of the territories ow known as Saudi Arabia by the treaty igned at Jedda on the 20th Way, 1927, *** - ’ /i] he relations established by that treaty avolve certain mutual obligations, notably, iy Article 2, each of the High entrusting arties undertakes to maintain goo , re la- ions with the other and to endeavour by all he means at his disposal to proven * * territoriesterritories being used as a base for unlaw* ful activities directed against peace and tranquility in tbe territories of the other party. Iraq. The relations between His Majesty's Government and Iraq will be governed until 1957 or longer by the Treaty \ of 30 th June, 1930, which oamejlnto force upon the entry of Iraq into the League of nations as an independent ctate in I September, 1932. The High Contracting Parties undertake that, without prejudice to obligations under the Covenant and the Treaty for the Kenunciation of ar, in the event of either of them becoming engaged in war, the other will Immediately come to his aid. The assistance which His Majesty's Government are to render to j-raq doe;, not extend to the maintenance of internal order but it is recognised that the protection of the essential communications of His Majesty'sLjesty’a aorernBont la In the oomnon interest of both parties. In Batters of foreign policy which may affect their ocoaon interests the High Contracting Parties agree full and frank consultation.. His llajeaty 1 Xatassador at Baghdad, and hie successors, are to enjoy preoedence in relation to the representatives of other powers. Iraq under takes that when in need of the services of foreign officials she will normally engage British subjects, and that for the purpose of military instruction only British subjects will be engaged. Transjordan. The relations between Bis Majesty’s OoTernment and the Amir are determined by the Agreement made between His Majesty the King and His Highnesain February, 1923, the ratifications of which were exchanged on the ;lst October, 1929 . Full responsibility is accepted by Hia Majesty as Mandatory for Trana-Jordan; and by Article 5 AgreementAgreement, the Amir agrees to be guided by 14 3! the adrioe of His Majesty in all matters concerning foreign relations of Trans* Jordan as well as in all matters affecting the international and financial obligations and interests of His Majesty in respect of Trans-Jordan. 4. The direct relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq are governed by various instruments, notably the huhaomara Convention of 5^^ May, 1922; the Bahra Agreement of 1st November, 1925» an &lt;* *ke Treaty of Friendship and Bon Voisinage and the Kxtradition Treaty of 193 1 * The Hadda Agreement of the 2nd Hovember, 1925 , defines the frontier between Hejd and Trans-Jordan and makes provision for the settlement of certain question 3 connected with the frontier, tfith a view to promoting friendly relations between the two countries. Mo6. Ho definite agreement has been polled with the doTernment of 3audi Arabia * to the definition of the frontier between Ljaz and Trans-Jordan, but, by the exchange of ttes appended to the Treaty of Jedda, King Hn 3aud has expressed his willingness to Slntain the status quo In the t a* an -Aqaba ilstriot and not to interfere in its ilministration until fawourable oiroumstanees illl permit a final settlement of the I question. 5 * In oonformity with the general policy of His Majesty^ Government, a further itago will have been reached in the process if establishing these international relations in a regular basis when effect has been given to the proposed mutual recognition between tbn 3aud as King of Saudi Arabia, and Ibdullah as Amir of the State of frans-Jordan, fcioh, it is contemplated, will be followed by tbe conclusion of a treaty of Friendship teUeen the two countries*6 * burning now to another aspect of the matter, the following are the chief reasons which hare influenced His Majesty* Government in giving their support to the maintenance of Ibn Saud v s regime in Saudi Arabia t •» (a) Having regard to the great concern to His Majesty's Government of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, to their mandatory responsibility for Trans-Jordan and their special interests in Iraq, l Koweit and Bahrein, it hasbeen recognised that it is of great advantage to His Majesty's Government that the main area of the Arabian Peninsula should be under a more or less ordered Government with which they can maintain normal diplomatic relations and of importance that those relations should be a friendly character.(*) Only by t* 1 ® eatablishment of auoh c lered goTernment in Arabia oan the safety and good treatment of Moslem pilgrims, many of whom are British subjects, or under British protection, be ensured* (e) Moreover, the stability of the Saudi Government, as the custodian of the holy places of Mecoa and Medina, is of importance, especially in the eyes of the Moslemsof India, who have oome to loot upon i Ibn Saud as holding a position in the Moslem world somewhat analogous to that which they formerly asoribed to the Sultan of 'Turkey. (t) Ware relations between His Majesty’s Government and King Ibn Saud not of a friendly character, he might well absorb Koweit, interfere Bahrein and even attempt to obtain an influence ©▼er the Truoial Sheikhdoms. There have been occasional indications that some at least of the Truoial Sheikhs would not be unresponsive. (e)(©) HI a Majesty’s (lovernment would view with conoern the establiahment of Soviet influence in Arabia. King Ibn Saud has shown himself to be of the same view and for this reason merits support. When recently Eia Majesty’s Government were unable to comply with King Ibn Saud’s request for a loan, he informed them that he might be obliged, though most reluctantly, to aooept Soviet oifers of financial assistance. Were the relations between His Majesty’s Government and him to deteriorate, he might be readier to accept the advances of the soviet Government• 7 . As regards the support given to the Hashiaita family ia Ira 9 and Trand_ Jordan, Hia MaJ.sty'a Gorernment have been influ.no.d toy the following conaiderationas- (a) His Majesty’s Government recognise that they remain under special obligationsoblisationa t0 tha &amp;I ‘^ 8 ^ n S from tbs part played by the latter in war against Turkey. (b) King Peisal and the Amir Abdullah have shown theraselres to he well disposed to His Majesty 1 a Government. It is not necessary to enter into detail, hut two recent oases in whioh the latter has, by hia oo-operation, materially assisted Hie Majesty’s Government are the Druse rebellion and the disturbances in Palestine in I 929 , ( 0 ) His Majesty’s Government have maintained their support of the Haahimitee for iaany years, and there is nothing which in their view suggests the desirability of any change in a polioy to which they are deeply committed. On the contrary, there are a P*cial relations with Iraq, arising out 0f th9 T r«aty of Alliano., whioh inTolv. =onu n u»4 support; whll. In th. case of Transfer danfrans-Jordan, His Majesty’s Gorernment have a special responsibility, as the Mandatory power, to support the regime which has been set up in that country under their direct protection. (d) vren it His Majesty's Government had grounds for serious dissatisfaction, there is no obvious alternative to the Hashimites as rulers in Iraq or Trans-Jordan 8 . The possibility is recognised that the kingdom of I bn 3aud may break up on his death, but it would not be to the advantage of His Majesty's Government to do anything to hasten its disruption. On the contrary, it is to their interest to do all that they can to maintaingood relations with Saudi ^rabia and to support I bn Saud as ruler of a united kingdoia. nevertheless, account must be taken of the mutual animosity between Ibn Saud and the Hash!miteHasfcimite family resulting from past evants, wiiioh cannot be expected entirely to disappear even as a result of the estab lishment of relations on the basis of mutual recognition and treaties of friendship. 1'he possibility of the continuance of disputes and of conflicting interests must be accepted, and the full reconciliation of the two complementary aspects oi’ the policy of His Majesty’s Government presents a problem, the solution of which is not without difficulty. Support of Ibn Sand’s regime in Saudi Arabia cannot be given at the expense of support of the Hashimite rulers in their own territories, and His Majesty’s Government must take full account of the repercussions likely to be produced ia territories over which they exercise nuuxdatory responsibility or towards which they stand in special relations. Despite, however, the existence of these difficulties, no question has arisenaor does the question now arise, of choosing as between Ibn Baud and the Hashimite family, or of subordinating the interests of one to the other. If erenta should, unhappily, lead to that, a new situation would be created in which the whole position would hare to be carefully reviewed. It is not euggeated that there is liJcelihood of His Majesty’s Government being faced with such a dilemma* latterly, however, some anxiety has been caused in respect of relations between Trans-Jordan and Saudi Arabia, owing to the evidence of widespread and continuous intrigues against the Saudi rdgime which are believed to have been conducted, in part at least, within Trans-Jordan itself* It is the xact that the ilinir has conformed all his of* xcial acts to the requests made to him in connexion with the situation created by these intrigues. But there are many indicationsindications that he knew of these intrigues, even apposing that he did not encourage them, and it seetus not unlikely that other persons hare actively engaged in the conspiracy, and have Ki&amp;de use of the; mir or of his name, either with or rithout his acquiescence, for the furtherance of subversive activities against Ibn Saud* In consequence, a difficult, and perhaps even serious, situation has threatened to develop. 10 . much has been done already, at your instance, by the authorities in f rrans-Jordan and Palestine to prevent those territories from being used a© a base for improper activities against the Saudi rdgime. Effective co-operation in Trans-Jordan played an important part in the frustration of the Ibn Bifada revolt. This has been followed by the expulsion of an important section of the disaffected Beni Atlya, and by the exclusion from both Palestine and Trans-Jordan various suspects. Moreover, it is tobe hoped that the mutual recognition of the Amir Abdullah and King Ibn Saud and the proposed treaty will materially improYe matters. The fact remains, however, that the existence of anti-Saudi intrigue is contrary to the wishes the interests of His Majesty's Government; and further, having regard to their treaty obligations, Hpd in particular those embodied in Article £ of the Treaty of Jedda, the credit of fiifl Majesty's Government will be at stake if such iatri;?ues are conducted in territory for which they are responsible. In view of the past history of Saudi Arabia, and having regard to ^rab mentality, it is recognised that it is hardly to be x*op 8 d that intrigue against the Saudi regime in territories under Haehlmite rule or influence can be completely •topped; but His Majesty's Gorernment consider it a definite obligation to We all measures possible to restrict this kind of actirity within limits which will not constitutea threat to the stability of the Saudi regime &gt;r expose Hie Majesty f s Government to charges of indifference, if not of actual toleration. It is of course a corollary of this policy that Ibn Saud should be required to maintain a correct attitude towards his Eashimite neighbours. 11 . I should be glad if, talcing the foregoing considerations into account, you will review the position, with special reference to fraua-Jordan, in the light of all the information available, ^.nd report what stepo can, in your opinion, be taken ( 1 ) for restricting anti- auci intrigue, and in r~ us it c ay oe it. ossiLle to ; reveiit it, &amp;1 least for neutralising its effect; and ! generally for promoting the establishment of better relations between Trans-Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

(S) THE SUB-GOMI ITTEE iiad under consideration the question of the relations existing between Transjordan and Saudi Arabia. The following papers were laid before the meeting:- Paper No. M.13.(0) 84 - Copies of correspondence between the Foreign * Office and Colonial Office and His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda and the High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan, between the dates 18th November, 1932, and 9th January, 1933. Paper No. M.E,(0) 87 - paraphrase of a telegram from the Acting High Commissioner for Transjordan to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated 10th January, 1933. THE CHAIRMAN stated that this was a matter with which the Foreign Office and Colonial Office were principally con cerned and he invited Mr. Rendel to initiate the discussion, as the matter had been brought before the Committee at the request of the Foreign Office. MR. RENIEL said that the views of the Foreign Office were as stated in their letters of the 1st and 20th Decemoer, 1932, to the Colonial Office (Nos. 6 , p. 9, and 10, p. 21 «f paper M.E. (0) 84). In the view of the Foreign Office there A was no doubt that the recent risings against Ion Saud had teen instigated from outside Saudi Arabia under the aegis of the Hashimites, and more particularly under that of the Amir Abdulla. A mass of evidence to this effect had been received, and was still accumulating. Most of it could not well be produced either in the Press or in a court of law. Taken ao a whole, however, it was pretty conclusive. The Saudi Govern ment had. brought definite accusations, not against His Majesty Government but against their proteges, for whose actions His Majesty’s Government were morally and legally responsiole. His Majesty’s Government were thus placed in an extremely em barrassing position, since the Foreign Office were convinced . that these accusations were in the main well-founded. His Majesty’s Government must either deny the accusations, which ^hey could not do, or return no reply, which would re ignominious, and equivalent to an admission of impotence, °c take some definite action against /_4_ the intriguers which would as far as possible prevent the con tinuance of these activities. Merely to give vague assurances would not meet the case, would leave the Saudi Government with a legitimate grievance, and might permanently poison relations between them and His Majesty’s Government. He fully realised the difficulties of the situation. No doubt from the point of view of the local authorities the problem of main importance was that of the rivalry of Jews and Arabs in Palestine, ±he relations of Transjordan to Central Arabia probably appeared to the High Commissioner to be of secondary importance. But the Foreign Office could not accept this as a reason for allowing the Amir Atdulla to continue to conduct intrigues against a friendly foreign Power with apparent impunity. Had Saudi Arabia been under the authority of some great Power, such as France or Italy, our position would long ago have been made quite untenable. We should probably have been arraigned befoi some international tribunal, we should have been unable to make any adequate defence and a first-class dispute might well h: ve developed. In the case of the Syrian reoellion of 1925, the French Government had taken a very serious view of the compara tively small amount of support which the hruzes had obtained Transjordan, and we had been obliged, as a result of their action, to take very severe measures. From the foreign Office point view the necessity for taking serious action to put an end such intrigues in Transjordan was just as great in the Co.se of Saudi Arabia as if we were dealing, with a great Po-er, since moral and legal international obligations were identical. Again, if Ibn Saud were to allow similar intrigues against us to develop in his territory, for example by allowing anti B^iti propaganda to be actively disseminated among the British Indian pilgrims to Mecca, we should feel that we had a strong gr'-5- 2o7 against* liiiiiy buci 7/0did. C 6 i*tsin.ly no c aixo'w tii© inirigucs to continue. Our own oblignt-ions towards Ibn Sand wsp© similar and the continuance of these intrigues was likely to place His Majesty s Government in a position of increasing embarrassment, possibly even of danger* The Foreign Office, therefore, were anxious to see drastic action taken against the principal intriguers, so that there might lie no doubt as to our attitude. Suitable measures would lee for instance the dismissal of the Amir Shakir from the Presi dency of the Seduin Control Board, a position which he had great ly aleused, and from which the local authorities had more than once urged that he should be dismissed. The case against the Amir Shakir, though mostly oased on confidential evidence, was overwhelming; yet no action had been taken against him, and all that had happened had been that the Amir Abdulla had given a specious assurance that Shakir was unlikely to indulge in anti- Saudi activities, as members of his family lived in Saudi Arabia. A further measure which might well be taken was the dis missal of the Mayor of Akaba, who was publicly known to have sheltered Ibn Rifada and some of his associates at the time of his original incursion into Saudi territory. The case against him was also overwhelming, Uut no action had been taken. The measures hitherto taken had been directed only against minor in dividuals and had not touched the root of the problem. In reply to a question from Mr. Williams, he said that while :::os ^ °f the evidence could not be produced, there were many known cases on which charges might be framed.. The recent meeting of the Amir Shakir and the Amir Tallal with ad Dabbagh, who was one of the prime movers in the Asir rebellion, was well known; but the Amir Abdulla f s statement that the meeting had been purely fortuitous had apparently been accepted without question. As a result of strong pressure from the Foreign Office, the High Commissioner had been asked some time ago to consider the POosibility of conveying a severe warning to the Amir that further intrigues would not be tolerated. The action taken however, as reported in the High Commissioner’s telegram No.170 of December 8th , 193 2 (pages 18-20 of paper M.E.(O) 84) seemed to be of a very different and much milder character than what had been contempla ted here,MR. VILLI. JIS pointed out the impossibility of stopping intrigue in an Arab country like Transjordan, r-p a pew agents of conspiracy could he removed, others would take their place. He also thought that it would he most unwise for the Colonial Office to •mpgss Sir Arthur Vauchope to make an^ threat to the x' Amir which v/e were not prepared to implement, if necessary, later on. In this connection it should he home there was no question, at any rate in press it c of considering the deposition of the Amir. in mind tnat meumst anc es, MR. REHDEL said that it did not seem necessary at this stage to go do far as to threaten to depose the •jair in order to -bring pressure to bear on him. no was convinced that Sir A. Wauchope, if he really wisned to take a strong line with the Amir, was quite capable of doing so. Moreover, though the Amir was for local purposes an independent sovereign, the fact remained that E.M. Government were directly responsible to Nations, and to other Powers, for the administration of Transjordan under the Palestine mandate. The Amir had formally undertaken to be guided bp tue adv.ee Government in all matters of foreign policy. Further, the Amir was dependent on h.M. Government financially and for military protection against external a a&amp; reosion. these circumstances we surely had a considerable him, and he did not think that we could escape the responsibility of keeping him in order if his conduct ^ • 4. .-.v. iTTvnnqsihlc international should threaten to lead us moo ^ . ^ ^-p the telegrams and despatches position. From the to&amp;e ox . e-p-p-iee could not hut i eel from Transjordan the Foreign 0 -that the authorities in Transjordan did not realise the seriousness of the situation, nor the importance attached hy His Majesty f s Government to the cessation of anti-Saudi intrigue in territory under their control. It almost looked indeed as though the local authorities could not he in full sympathy with the policy of His Majesty’s Government on this question, as he could not believe that they would not otherwise have taken more efiective measures to deal with the situation. It so, he thought it essential that they should he left under no misapprehension as to the policy of his Majesty’s Government and as to the necessity tor making it unmistakably cle^r that His Majesty 1 s Government were determined to do all in their power to stop intrigues against a friendly state continuing in territory under their control. MR. WILLIAMS said that to take my .rustic action against Abdullah, which would end to impair either his prestige in Transjordan, n his goodwill ts His Majesty’s Government, would &gt;e to play into the hands of the anti-British ‘actions which were now becoming increasingly ictive among the Arabs in Palestine and ’pansjordan. We rely to a great extent on ibdullah’s goodwill to keep in check anti-British p.n c] Rnr*i es« MR. difficulties RL'HDLL considered tnat internal should not he allowed to prevent His Majesty's Government from fulfilling their international obligation to prevent Transjoidancontinuing to te a focus of anti-Saudi intrigue. He urged tiint tnis point should 'be empiiasised in ; nv further communications to the High Commissioner* It would 'be for the High Commissioner to decide what measures were 'best calculated to make the attitude of His Majesty’s (iovernment and of the British authorities unmistakably clear. Possibly some general proclamation on the subject would be an effective measure. The last proclamation of the kind had merely dealt with one aspect of the question with particular reference to the I bn Pnfada rebellion which v/as now over* MR. WILLIAMS, while recognising our treaty obligations towards Ibn Saud, said that His Majesty's Government had also international obligations ^ ' ig from the mandate as regards the inhabitants of Transjordan. It was obviously impossible to exile all known or suspected intriguers. He said that the action taken in the case of tuo Dr rebellion was before an independent Arab Government had been acknowledged in Transjordan. This factor, while not affecting our international ooli^ons, did to oe into account 1» «»*«*«** *“* i« metnods .hould M THE CHAI^-HV'T said that tne u-m point general nature arising out of the Foreign OffAc- , . .

For years past the Re/.F. had been hampered by Abdullah ? s intrigues. Prior to the formation of the Desert Police the work of the R.-.F. in trying to deal with inter-tribal raiding had been extremely difficult and even when culprits hod been taken red-handed and given ever to the Transjordan administration, it had frequently occurred that they were subsequently released on the word of Abdullah. Thus, and in other ways-, had the prestige of Imperial forces suffered in the eyes of Transjordan tribesmen. At the present time, although bdullah might make excuses for such situations as the meeting between Talal and Shakir and the Dabbaghs in Jerusalem, those excuses were worth nothing locally, where everybody would be convinced, including Ibn Saud, that Abdullah nad arranged things. Quite apart from the possible threat of counter action by Ibn Saud which* although unlikely at present, Wo,s by no means a past contingency, the Air Ministry were definitely concerned at the adverse effect on British prestige which resulted from Abdullah’s intrigues. It was 'effect' which chiefly concerned the .Air Ministry and it certainly seemed time, in their opinion, at Abdullah was brought to book. In reply to a further question from the Chairmen, said that he did not think that the situation as between udi Arabia and rrans jordaniu was now serious.10 . (g) l/IR. LAITHWAITE said the question was not one , i u was of direct concern to the India Office. The general jj^rescion left hj r the notarial which had heen circulated ^—3 that the Amir and his entourage had definitely 'been indulging in improper activities against the Saudi regime, Irt there v;as obviously force in the Colonial Office vie’.? that cur hards were to some extent tied by the impossibility of producing the secret information on which any sanctions would le based. On the o Lher hand, while the latest telegrams from Jedda showed that Sir A. Ryan’s skilful handling of the . situation had to some extent patched over the present incident, the history of this case went to show that sooner or xater we might be faced with a really serious situation in which drastic action against the Amir night have to be taken. Would it be possible to bring pressure to bear upon hin either by reducing his subsidy or by tightening our control over his external relations for which we were responsible? As regards the point that we had a definite obligation to Trans-Jordan and were bound to defend its interests, v/e had also obligations, though Ox a di-f^rent type, towards Ibn Sotid, whose importance from tte point of view of our general policy and of India y&lt;as possibly considerably greater than that of Trans-Jordan, a~d ./no, so far as we could judge, had in the present case a great deal of right on his side. It might well be that in certain circumstances it might prove necessary to gt * satisfaction even at some cost to the. intei-ots Jordan. THE CHAIRMAN sai dihat all the latest infornation, sn t to show that, in fact, there was now a definite improve- QanrM Arabia and Transjordsnia, Dnt in the relations between Saudi Ara. vlew that Sir Andrew Ryan ad he ventured to express onehad handled matters at Jedda adinira'bly. Reverting to the question of intrigues, he enquired whether the real focus of anti-Saudi intrigue might not really he in Baghdad rather than in Transjordan. MRp WARNER said that the information at the disposal of the Foreign Office indicated that King Feisal was playing a waiting game and had lately even curbed his brother Abdullah* s activity against Ibn Saud. Quite recently King Feisal appeared to be playing a more prominent part* but ever since information about the anti—Saudi intrigues began to be received, it pretty plainly pointed to Transjordan as their focus. CAPTAIN MOORE stated that the Admiralty were not directly concerned. He was doubtful if the dismissal of Shakir would satisfy Ibn Saud or stop further intrique, which would be continued elsewhere. He asked whether all the evidence at the disposal of the Foreign Of!ice had been communicated to the High Commissioner.L THE CHAIKt.lAH said that all the infomation obtained hy His Majesty T s Government throu^i secret sources, might not have been communicated to him 0 As regards the Foreign Office letter of the 20th December, its contents had been sent to him personally, MR„ RJHTDEL explained that there v/as no question of any action which might novr be taken being forced on us by Ibn Saud* This might possibly have been said had we acted under the imminent threat of hostile action by the Akhwan, The Foreign Office had fully recognised the undesirability of taking action as a result of such a threat a But that threat had now been removed - for the present at any rate - and what the Foreign Office were urging was that action should be taken to implement our clear international obligations. They were not urging that we should show any special favour to Ibn Saud, But so long as no effective steps were taken, the danger of the position growing worse would continue, and we might in the end be obliged to take much more drastic action than that now proposed. In reply to a question, he admitted that mutual recognition between Ibn Saud and Abdullah might improve matters. He doubted, however, whether that recognition would materialise unless something could be done to show that active measures were being taken to improve the present situuHon. The Foreign Office were quite prepared to leave the details of these measures to the High Commissioner, provided the latter recognised the importance ox the matter 'being effectively and rapidly dealt with. MR. GRIEVE; on being asked for his views by the Chairman, suggested that the policy of His Majesty's Government vis-ay-viE a foreign State was not entirely a matter for settlement bythe man on the spoto It 7 ^as part of the business of a Governor to maintain the good name of His Majesty's Government as a ,; neighhour ,f « He thought that the High Commissioner could make it clear to Abdullah that intrigues must cease 5 without actually disclosing the sources of informati on. Our financial hold on Abdullah did not amount to much and could hardly be used as a threats as it was impossible to cut down a grant made for public purposes c MR, VARH3R thought it possible that the High Commission er was not fully aware of the importance attached by His Majesty's Government to the suppression of the intrigues in Transjordan^ and suggested that a clear statement of policy on the subject should be made to him and that he should be asked what further steps could be taken tc suppress them e MR, GRIRVIj said that it seemed that no comprehensive statement of the case had been sent to the High Commissionero The facts had been presented to him piecemeal in a series of telegrams and despatches. He doubted whether it would be wise to instruct the High Commissioner what actual measures he should take to suppress anti-Saudi activities. He agreed that the case against Shakir was overwhelmingly strong and that the High Commissioner should be supplied with concrete evidence as to his complicity, t.jwUgh it should be possible for the Colonial Office and Foreign Office to agree in the terms of a despatch wmch mould make it plain that part of the High Commissioner's duty was to keep down intrigues which disturbed the peace of a neighbouring power and, if not dealt with, brought dis credit on the Imperial Government, The High CommiSoioner could be trusted to find a way of dealing with Abdullah.MR. WABKER agreed, Ixit tho-ught that the measures proposed hy the Foreign Office might he suggested to the high Commissioner indepenu.ently^ TIE (TilAIKMAN expressed the opinion, which he thought reflected the general viev^s of the meeting, that it would ho most valuable to have a restatement of His Majesty’s Government' s policy in Aral) affairs. He suggested that the Foreign and Colonial Offices should prepare such a document, in consultation, in the form of a despatch to he sent out for the guidance of the High Commissioner who could ho asked auite generally what further steps he might he able to suggest for implementing that policy from the point of view of minimising anti-Saudi intrigue in Trans- jerdano MR, V/AEN3R said that it would he of great assistance and would supplement the. active policy, now being pursued for the recognition of Ibn Gaud by Abdullah, if Sir Andr&gt;w Ryan were able to communicate to Ibn Saud at an early date a statement which would show that serious measures were being taken by His Majesty's Government to stop the intrigues in Transjordan, If effective action could be taken, such as the removal of Shakir, the hands of the Foreign Office would be enormously strengthened. • i cvioiHr* from the Bedouin He thought that the dismissal oi Shuki , , , „ vq effected on the grounds of his Control Board could do .iie&gt;-, unsuitability for this appointment, a view with which bo Colonel Ccx and Captain Glubb apparently agreed. , + . + this question should be dissociated quite agreed that tnis q.u -00 from the despatch on general policy. ^ •+’, the -proposal that a clear MR.

He also further agreed that not to confuse the issue by loading up this it would 'be woll statement with detailed sug ;estions. He trusted, however, that this would not mean that action against the Amir Shakir would ho indefinitely postponed., it was true that, owing mainly to the smilful handling of the situation hy Sir A. Ryan, the imminent menace of an Akhwan invasion had been dispelled. The political danger, however-, still existed, c^.d an indefinite continuance of the present situation was hound adversely to affect our relations with Saudi Arabia as a whole. In that event the Akhwan menace might be revived. He would therefore like to make his agreement to the proposal to address a full despatch to the High Commissioner on the general question of policy, subject to the rider that the possibility of taking imme diate measures against such notorious intriguers as the Amir Shaker should not be lost sight of. Possibly this point might be dealt v/ith in a separate but simultaneous despatch. CONCLUSION. THE SUB -COMMITTEE AGREED (a) That it was desirable that a clear statement of His i,!a;jeaty ? s Government f s policy on Arab affairs should be drawn up with a view to its being sent to the High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan for guidances the despatch to bo accompanied by a request that the High Commissioner would examine the position in the light of the statement and consider whether further action could be taken to keep down anti-Saudi intrigue in Transjordan, (b) That tho Colonial Office should prepare this statement in consultation with the Foreign Office.•Pupt;3?

NOo 216, My telegram No. 216. Memorandum summarised in my telegram No. 206 was probably Fuad's and entered as caveat against probable Dabbagh complicity, directly the Idrisi show fight; it may be regarded as timely routine movement based on old evidence. Latest memorandum however shows definite signs of having come from Riyadh, It claims to be based on evidence from three sources, namely persons from Transjordan, reports from frontier and events in Asir. No mention is made of any capture of recent correspondence with Amman but possibility of this cannot be discarded for it is clear that something sufficiently serious has transpired to make Ibn Saud threaten His Majesty's Government with uncon troll ability of his Ikhwan. I take it to be simultaneous effect of bad news from the south (e.g. widespread nature of revolt itself, backing in arms and money from conspirators and perhaps attitude of Iman or his son) and dis quieting news from the north (e.g. Dumeik-Nuri Shalan -6-combination) combined with His Majesty's Government's apparent unconcern. In Ibn Saud’s own view, as I see it, he is faced with Abdullah's second vicarious aggression in progress and third in .prospect, while His Majesty's Government he probably holds to have shown insufficient consideration for his (to him) complete frankness and truthful exposition of August 5th; in reply they have upheld Abdullah and shown no disposition to control him or his agents any more effectively than in the past. Ibn Saud probably sees history repeating itself and is determined to forestall and pursue any third incursion by having Ikhwan ready to hand and being able to say afterwards that they got out of hand and I told you so. (My latest local information in this connexion is that Ibn Musaad of Hail has been placed in command). If Ibn Saud has really begun to concentrate Ikhwan north ward I doubt whether anything we can now say will suffice to restore his confidence to the extent necessary to check it. Only radical action on our part would take effect. This would naturally have to be undertaken before threat to frontier peace actually developed: thereafter we should be committed to uttering grave warnings and strengthening frontier defence without any serious prospect of preventing 'uncontrolled' Incursions and bloodshed. Endless recrimination would follow. Relations and major policy would suffer.

Sir John Simon is in general agreement with the analysis of King Ibn Baud's outlook in the master con tained in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Mr. Hope Gill’s telegram No. 216 of 29 oh November and considers that, if true, as appears likely, that a concentration of the Akhwan has taken or is taking place in the direction of the Transjordan frontier, only some definite action of Nzir's exasperation at the a nature to allay King Abdul apparent unwillingness or inability of his ...a„.es y Government to check the continuance of intrigues -n Under Secretary of State COLONIAL OPT ICD.- 10 - Transjordan against himself will suffice to avert an exceedingly grave situation with a serious risk of armed incursions ty the Akhwan into Transjordan, 5 . As Sir Philip Gunliffe Lister is aware, Sir John Simon has for long considered that the situation, in which His Majesty's Government are placed hy their inability to deny the accusations of hostile activities which King I bn Saud has made against the Amir Ataullah and others in Transjordan, is not only embarrassing and ignominious, hut prejudicial to their own wider interests. It was, however, decided when the possi bility of remedying this situation was considered in connexion with the Amir’s suspected complicity in the Ibn Eifada rebellion and on the receipt of King Ibn Saud’s secret memorandum of the 6 th August, (a eo^y of which was enclosed in Foreign Office letter No. E. 4394/1241/25 of the 10 th October,) that such a drastic step as the removal of the Amir from his positi as ruler of Transjordan was undesirable on other grounds, at any rate at the present stage, and that in any case such action should not be taken as a direct result of pressure from King Ibn Saud nor in default of direct evidence of tho truth of the accusation made against him by that Monarch, which could be published. No sufficient evidence of a publishable nature appears yet to have been adduced against the Anir; while the recent communications of the Saudi Government are not only directed to securing the Amir Abdullah’s removal, but have contained veiled threats of action against Transjordan by aimed forces.04 -11' Jolin Simon therefore does not desire to suggest that the question of the removal of the Amir should again he considered at this juncture* He trusts, however, that Sir Philip Cunliffe Lister will agree to consult the High Commissioner for Transjordan at once as to the possibility of taking immediate and effective action of a forcible nature with the Amir designed to bring about a complete cessation of any communications which he or his associates may still be holding with persons involved in rebellious activities against King Ibn Saud* 4, Further, Sir John Simon considers it most desirable that immediate action, of as drastic a nature as may be possible, should be taken against those ^.n Transjordan in the case of whom there is evidence of complicity in the plots against ding IbriSaud - more particularly those in the immediate vicinity of the Amir and notably the Amir Shakir. Since Sir J o Wauchope has already oeen requested, in Colonial Office telegiam No s 164 of the 26th November to expedite his views on this question, which has long been under discussion, immediate action in the matter will, S^-r o chn Sxiiio trusts, be possxble.. I am, however, to suggest for Sir Po Cunliffe Lister's consideration that a further telegram be sent to Sir A* 7 /aucnope, pointing him that immediate action against the persons concerned - and especially the Amir Shakir - if sufficiently severe, will provide His llajesty's Government with some matenax for a reply to the memorandum from the Saudi Government r&lt;-i 11 * p telegram No» 215 of ^he summarised in Miv Hope Ci-i-x 27th November^* rf a satisfactory reply is received from Sir Arthur V/auchope on the above points, Sir John Simon will he prepared to send instructions to Mr, Hope Gill to reply to the Saudi Government on the following lines s- (a) His Majesty's Government will hold the Saudi Government responsible for any consequences which may ensue from hostile activities on the part of the Akhwan against Transjordan and will use every means at their disposal to repel them* (b) The Saudi Government will be informed of the punitive action taken against the Amir Shakir and others in Transjordan involved in complicity in the Ibn Rifada rebellion, the Dabbagh plots, etc* (c) The Saudi Government will be given any suitable inf or- nation of other specific measures taken in Transjordan to prevent assistance boing given to possible rebellious move ments in Saudi Arabia, e.g., measures taken as a result of Colonial Office telegram to Sir a.

The nature of the steps taken previously to prevent the use of the A protectorate by those plotting against Ibn Saud in Asir or elsewhere and of any additional steps which the Resident at Aden may report as a result of Colonial Office telegram to him No. 30 of the 26th November could also be communicated to the Saudi Government at the same time* 6 .

No. 165. Jedda telegram No. 215 to Foreign Office (of November 27th Trans Jordan-Saudi relations) repeated to you as No. 276. His Majesty's Charge d f Affaires at Jedda reports to the following effect t - Begins - Saudi Government f s latest memorandum shows deiinite signs of being inspired by King Ibn Saud personally and although no reference is made to captured correspondence between Abdullah and rebels (see paragraph 7 of Jedda telegram No. 214 (of November 25th) to Foreign Office), it may v^ell be based upon such correspondence, since it is clear that evidence is sufficiently serious to make Ibn Saud feel justified in hinting at possible action by Akhwan. Combination of spread of Asir revolt obviously supported from abroad, and of disquieting news from north (e.g. possible combination of Dumeik and Nuri Shalan) appears to have convinced Ibn Saud that intriguers in Transjordan are again active and that Abdullah is planning yet another vicarious aggression. Ibn Saud, ^ho is already exasperated by apparent inability of His r.ajesty Government to control these intrigues, now seems likely to try to forestall any further incursion by having Akhwan ready to hand. Latest local information is that Ibn Musaad of Hail has now been placed in command of Ahkwan concentrations. Lnds.2 # present situation, in which Akhwan may, with or without Itn Baud’ s tacit approval, take the law into their own hands ■ by attacking Transjordan, is one of serious danger. Contin uance of position in which His Majesty's Government cannot deny accusation of hostile activities which King Ibn Baud has made against the Amir Abdullah and his associates in Transjordan, is embarassing and ignominious. In any case, unless radical steps &amp;re taken to remedy situation in near future, relations between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Baud are likely to become so difficult as not only to lead to increasingly serious friction on Transjordan frontier, but to prejudice British interests through out Middle bast. 3 . In these circumstances I shall be glad if you will consider the possibility of making really strong representations to Amir, drawing his attention to rumours of his alleged complicity in Asir rising, and urging upon him with all force at your command necessity for complete cessation of any communications which he or his associates may still be holding with persons involved in rebellious activities against King Ibn Baud. 4. It also seems desirable that immediate drastic action should be taken against those in Transjordan in the case of whom there is definite evidence of complicity in the plots against Ibn Baud, more especially if possible those in the immediate vicinity of the Amir, and in particular the Amir Shakir. Such action, if suf ficiently severe, would provide His Majesty’s Government with some material for reply to memorandum summarised in Jedda telegram No. 215 (of November 27th) to Foreign Office, and might prevent situation from becoming even more dangerous* 5. Assuming that you are able to take action ^n accordanc with the above suggestions, His Majesty’s Government contemplate reply to Saudi Government on following lines: (a) They will hold Government responsible for consequences of any hostile ac ' 'against Transjordan 'by Akhwan, and will use all available means t 0 repel them; (b) Saudi Government will be informed of action taken by you on paragraphs 3 and 4 above; (c) any suitable information on other specific measures which you may have taken in Transjordan to prevent assistance to possible anti-Saudi conspirators, e«g. in case of Beni Atiya, could also be communi cated, together with details of measures already taken at Aden.

Addressed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies No. 169 repeated to Jeddah No© 1*79. Your telegram No* 164. I suggest that it would he desirable to support general assurance by following instances of support given by Amir to the policy of His Majesty's Government: (a) during Ibn Rafada’s revolt:- (l) he issued orders at the end of May prohibiting participation in Ibn ? Rafada's movement. (2) He assented to a lav; prohibiting the export of foodstuffs in June. (3) He signed proclamation in July establishing prohibited zone on frontier. (4) He issued orders to Arab Legion in latter part of July expressing n our desire that no person or party should give assistance to Ibn Rafada and those with him and that we are against those who have such an idea 1 '. The declaration of prohibited zone ? and other measures informally effectively stopped traffic of supplies to the rebels and prevented tribesmen other than 7 0 Beni Atiya from crossing frontier into Saudi Arabia. (b) Since Ibn Rafada's defeat:- (l) on 6 th October he gave me definite assurance that he would do nothing to assist any risings against Ibn Saud that night occur. (2) With con currence of Ibn Saud owing to conduct of Beni Atiya having been unsatisfactory bulk of tribe was not allowed to remain in Transjordan in view of possibility that they might attempt hostile action using territory of Transjordan as a base. (3) Mohammad Ibn Parhan is undergoing one year s imprisonment. 2. With regard to your telegram No. 163 and my reply N o. 168 (a) Salim Abu Domeik is in Transjordan having livedat Kerak District for over 5 years past. On 2Sth November Airi^ informed British Resident that at time the Beni Atiya wore being moved into Hedjaz he told Abu Domeik that he and his tribesmen must disregard any instructions to rise against Ibn Baud whoever might give them and that it was Amir : s conviction that any action against Ibn Baud would be harmful to himself and Beni Atiya because it was contrary to wishes of Kis Marjesty’s Government, Possibility of putting Abu Domeik under police supervision or of removing him to Palestine is being considered. Combination between him and Nuri Shalan is not considered likely, (b ) Mahmud Ibn Farhan brother Mohainmet has not yet complied with order to leave Transjordan. If still in Transjordan alter today he will be brought before Bedouin control beard. (c) ihere are no other important members of tribre in close toach with Amir. 5. Reference to letters from Williams to loung of 26th October and from Parkinson to me of 14th November, (a) Abdul Raouf Sabban has been dismissed by Amir and ordered to go to Bagdad- (b) It is difficult to produce concrete evidence on which Amir might be required to dismiss Amir Snaker &lt;uid Hamid Pasha Elwadi, They are Transjordan nationals end there are no legal grounds for ejecting them from country. (c) There are no proofs on which action could be taken against Shanqiti or Obeid Kabariti who are Trans jordanians. Hamid Kabariti might be removed from post as Mayor of Aicaba but do not recommend this as he is sometimes of use.

My telegram No. 169. I interviewed Amir Abdullah this morning in presence of Colonel Cox. Mr. A.L. Kirkbride acting as interpreter. 2. I said that last Summer Abdullah had said in his opinion Ibn Rifada would be utterly defeated but even so ha thought that trouble would later on arise in Southern Hejaz. I was grateful that (c. two groups) his two prophecies had proved correct. Did Abdullah think that troubles new going on in Southern Hejaz were serious (2 corrupt groups) replied that he would be always ready to give me information but on this subject he had very little knowledge. I replied; I do not think that troubles this year were very serious. I then said that I fully accepted and I relied on promise that Amir had given to me that he would give no support in any form to anyone who might cause disturbance in either the north or south of Hejaz. None the less I would make a definite request to Abdullah that he would hold no communication for the present -th people in Hejez= Abdullah said that he had written no otters for a long time to the Hejaz and he would not write iy while disturbances were going on* ± art 2 begins. 3 . I said that a report had reached me that a letter Pom Abdullah had been found at Jizan on 17th November addressed ^ Ali Dabbagh. Abdullah said again that he had written no s iter for a long tine, that he knew no nan of that name but ihat he knew members of that family*-19- 4 * I said that Beni Atiya had caused certain troubles during last few months and I recognised that Abdullah had given every assistance to the British Resident in removing bulk of Beni Atiya from Trans Jordan to the Hejaz. I however considered that Sheikh Selim Abu Domeik paramount Sheikh of Beni Atiya was one who possibly mightTfoment trouble end I therefore considered ^bu Domeik: should leave Trans Jordan for the present and live in Beersheba district until (corrupt group) are quiet in Hedjaz. I also considered Karayin Ibn Atiya who I am now informed is another Sheikh hostile to Ibn Saud and in close touch with Amir should also leave Trans Jordan and reside in Palestine* 5. Amir replied that he had always agreed to carry out any wishes of His Majesty's Government which I had put to him although he personally saw no reason to mistrust Abu Domeik or Karayin he would be quite ready to give orders that they should live in Palestine for the present. The British Resident and Captain Glubb would see that his orders were carried out. 6. I then said there were rumours that Amir Sha ker was m touch with disturbers of the peace in Hedjaz and I request Abdullah to tell Shaker that he must be most careful to show that he would give no support to any such people. The Amir said he would be willing to speak to Shaker to th. s as Shaker's family was resident in Hedjaz would not do anything unwise as that would only lead to his family getting trouble. Part 3 begins. 7. I asked Abdullah for his vie.s on present situation in Saudi Arabia. He said his views remained unchanged, namely , qhpikh of Koweit, the family at Ibn Saud was unpopular that SheiK oi i Anxious to achieve Ibn Rashid and people of Asir we ^ xv Q +• it was natural for Ibn Saud in this erthnnw rvC Thin Saud. that it wadifficult time to Toelieve that some of intrigues were due 1 to Abdullah and that it was even possible for enemies of Ibn Saud in order to strengthen their position, to aay that Abdullah was working for them but that this was untrue. He laiew his interests lay with the British Government he had given his promise not to work against Ibn Saud and he would keep that promise- It was true that Ibn Saud had behaved very badly to his family but people of Saudi Arabia had not asked him to go into that country and he had no inclination to mix himself in their politics. He had in fact agreed to recognise Ibn Saud. I said that I was sure that he would realise the serious nature of our conversation and I would inform my Government that I fully accepted his promise Viof good faith. The British Resident told me yesterday that the Executive and Legislative Councils wished the Amir to demand considerable charges in the Agreement of 1928. Realizing the seriousness of the subject which we had been discussing the Amir put forward no request regarding the Agreement, consider the time unsuitable for making any material changes in the Agreement. 9. I agree wi+h Colonel Cox and Captain Glubb in thinking the possibility of large body of Akhwan crossing the Trans Jordan frontier to be extremely remote. I agree with Air Officer Commanding that if they cross the frontier we shall be able to drive them back with little difficulty. His Majesty ? s Government need have little apprehension this score. Message ends.Foreign Office letter to Colonial Office. No. Eq 6495/76/&lt;j5 of the idOth December, 193a« IMPORTANT, FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l., 20th Decemher, 1932. Sir 5 I am directed ty Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to inform Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe Lister that he has had under consideration telegrams Nos. 169 and 170 of the 5th and 7th December respectively from the High Commissioner for Transjordan on the subject of the proposed reply to the recent representations of the Government of Saudi Arabia regarding anti-Saudi activities on the part of the Amir Abdullah and others in Transjordan. 2. Sir John Simon had hoped that Sir A.Wauchope’s telegrams would provide more adequate material to enable His Majesty’s Government to clear themselves of the not unjustified allegations of Ibn Saud tnat they have for long been tolerating the existence of intrigues in Transjordan directed against the peace and stability of Saudi Arabia. As Sir Philip Cunliffe Lister will De aware from Foreign Office letter No. E 6261/76/25 of the 29th November, Sir John Simon considers it unfortunate that no effective action has been taken in Transjordan to put an end to such intrigues. 3. It is impossible altogether to discount the rism that this inaction may lead to an outbreak of hostilities v/hich would involve the use of the Imperial forces in Transjordan against the forces of a friendly Sta^e. Although Sir A.Wauchope appears from the final paragraph of his telegram No. 170 to be confident that, if the Akhwan The Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office. -21--22- made large-scale incursions Into Trans^cnrvian^ tbe^ oouldr be repelled with little difficulty, Sir John Simon considers, that the resulting tension on the Transjordan frontier would he seriously embarrassing in itself and highly disturbing to the general interests of His Majesty’s Government in Arabia. It also appears to him that it would be in itself deplorable that the affairs of Transjordan should involve British forces in a clash with those of a State with whom His Majesty’s Government themselves are in relations of complete amity. 4. Apart, however, from the risk of hostilities, Sir John Simon foels strongly that it is damaging to the prestige of His Majesty’s Government that they should be open to an accusation of bad faith in that, while in friendly relations with King Ibn Saud and under a clear obligation to allow no subversive activities against him to oe initiated or supported in territory under their control, they in fact show extreme reluctance to restrict such activities in Transjordan, for v/hose foreign relations His Majesty s Government are responsible, and are consequently unable to maintain that they are carrying out their ooligations. 5. Sir John Simon directs me to make it clear that he does not consider it sufficient merely to return to the Saudi Government a temporising reply of an unconvincing character. He holds it important that His Majesty s (jovern ment should in fact take effective steps to restrain the Amir Abdullah from further participation in intrigues against King Ibn Saud and to break up the machinery in Transjordan through which contact v/ith anti-oaudi intrigu outside Transjordan is maintained. 6. it was for this reason that it was suggested in the letter from this Department referred to ahove that Sir A.Wauchops's efforts should he directed both to bringing about a cessation of the Amir Abdullah's association with anti-Saudi plotters and to taking action against others inTransjordan involved in complicity in such plots, notably the Amir Shakir. Sir AeWauchope’s telegrams Nos. 169 and 1^0 show, in Sir John Simon’s opinion, that he has neither taken nor proposes to take strong measures to achieve either of these objects. Prom the early part of his telegram No. 169 it may reasonably be deduced that he thinks that the situation will be sufficiently met if some kind of face-saving reply is made to the Saudi Government. 7. In paragraph l(a) of his telegram No. 169, for instance, he suggests that the proposed reply should refer to various public actions of the Amir, which appear to have been taken under pressure from the British authorities and can hardly be represented by His Majesty’s Government with frankness as indicating his true attitude. As regards paragraph 1(b)(1) of the same telegram, it can scarcely be expected that an assurance to abstain from complicity in any rising against King Ibn gaud given by the Amir to Sir A.Wauchope would at this date carry conviction with King Ibn Saud. Nor would it appear likely that His Majesty would be impressed by the information that steps had been taken against four sheikhs of the Beni Atiya tribe, since no action is to be taken against any of the main conspirators save Abdul Raouf Sabban and he is merely leaving Transjordan for Bagdad, a not much less favourable scene for anti- Saudi activities. 8. Prom the account given in Sir A* wauchope s uelegiam No. 170, Sir John Siraon finds it difficult to believe that rauch, if any, salutary effect will have been made upon the Amir Abdullah by the language held to him by the high Coimaissioner; nor does the Secretary of State regard as reassuring the Amir's statement that he has not been corresponding with persons in the Hejaz, since Hussein Dabbagh and the other main participants in the conspiracy to raise insurrections in Saudi Arabia ha\e tor long working from outside the Hejaz. It would in Sir Jehn Simonopinion have been preferable if bir A.Wauchope had taicen action of a more deterrent nature with the Amir, g He realises, however, that in the circumstances it would he difficult for tho High Commissioner to take up an entirely different and more forceful attitude regarding the unir’s own conduct in the matter at a further interview v/ith him in the immediate future. Sir John simon trusts, nevertheless, that Sir Philip Cunliffe Lister will agree to indicate to Sir A.Wauchope that he should not miss an opportunity for so doing should one arise after an interval. 10. Since at the moment no more satisfactory action appears practicable under this head, it seems all the more important to consider whether all that is possible is being done in regard to action against the ^mir Shakir and others, of whose anti-Saudi, activities His Majesty's Government possess clear indications. It is noticeable that Sir A. Wauchope has on various occasions referred in respect both of the Amir and others to the lack of concrete evidence and definite proof of their anti-Saudi activities. Sucn reference occurs in paragraph 3 of Sir «.•».aachope s teleg No. 169 of the 5th December. Sir John Simon f eels that Sir A. Veuchope over-estimates this objection to taking action. Nor is he convinced that substantial evidence is lacking in the case of either the Amir ohakir or H Pasha el „adi, although some of it may not b^ of a , . , on the evidence against which could he made public. N. these persons are enclosed for con/enience of r 11. I am to suggest, for the consideration of Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, that there is at any rate sufficient g j + rr of the Amir oha'-vir and Hamid for believing in the complicity oi ^ /u Pasha el Wadi in the Ibn Rifada revolt to justify Wauchope in informing the Amir Abdullah that His Majesty's Government have every reason to believe that Intimately involve! in tit. ervM!™*'' ^ ““ ” V ° 11 ’ -j34- Hthey consider such action contrary to the'iixter^st.g^Bn/L^ obligations both of Transjordan, and the mandat cry ~-po wer y who- ar e under a clear obligation of international law to prevent aterritory* for the foreign relations of which they are responsible, from being used for subversive intrigues against Ibn Saud, and that His Majesty’s Government must therefore demand that action should be taken against them. It appears that they should, at the least, be dismissed from their present positions of President of the Beduin Control Board and chief of the Amir’s Divan respectively and appointed to no other post 5 it would be preierable that they should be ordered to absent themselves from Transjordan. I am to refer in this connexion to the views expressed by the Resident at Amman and Captain Glubb in the correspondence enclosed in Mr, Blaxter $ s semi-official letter No. 97772/32 of the 4th November as to the unsuitability of the Amix Shakir for his position as President of the Beduin Control Board. The considerations mentioned by these officers appear to strengthen considerably the case for his dismissal from this post. 12. These are the two most important persons against whom His Majesty’s Government have evidence in the mat uer. Their dismissal would constitute public evidence that Mandatory Power disapprove of subversive &lt;j.ct.i.on agains friendly power,&lt;might well in conjunction with the departure of Abdul Raouf Sabban, disorganise the channels of corres pondencewith anti-Saudi intriguers outside Transjordan nd teach the Amir a salutary lesson. .3. sir John Simon also trusts that Sir Philip C uni iff e- jister will request Sir A.Wauchope to reconsider his opinion n regard to the dismissal of Hamid Kahariti from the post &gt;f Mayor of Aitaba. In his case Sir A.^auchope appear^ to idmit that the evidence is sufficient - indeed there seems &gt;0 reason to doubt that he was in constant communication rtth the rebels of Ibn Rifada’s movement after they hadpassed into the Hejaz and that he was engaged with his ■ brothers in the despatch of supplies to them; there is evidence too that he welcomed the rebels at Ah ah a on their passage from Palestine into the Hejaz. In these circum stances it appears highly undesirable that he should remain in a position of authority at Ah aba in the closest proximity to the frontier. 14 c Copies of this letter are being s ent to the India Office 3 the Air Ministry and the Admiralty.

No. 226. ky immediately preceding telegram and your telegram No.150, I do not consider it urgent to reply officially to Saudi memoranda of November 15th and November 26th provided I can discuss contents with reasonable freedom with Fuad, He will return to Jeada any day after January 1st. If I do not speak frankly His kajesty’s Government may be suspected of secret hostility or at least of v'aiting on events in Asir possibly in collusion with Italians. As Saudi Government already know from other sources of action taken at Aden I mentioned it to Fuad as proof of determination of His iiajesty’s Government to prevent use of British territory for subversive activities, I added unofficially that I believed Abdurrauf Sabban to have been dismissed. I assured Fuad that attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards Ibn Saud was unchanged. I am disappointed to learn from High Commissioner’s telegrams Nos. 169 and 170 how greatly lack of strict legal evidence stands in the way of really effective action against principal persons hostile to Ibn Saud e. g. Shakir and Hamid al T adi 'who though now possessed of Transjordan nationality are of Hejaz and Irap origin respectively. I should have thought there was enough against them to justify dismissal from posts even if legal considerations precluded deportation. Assuming however that nothing more can be lone I ask for authority when I see Fuad to make the most of measures taken in Aden as regards Fabbaghs and in Transjordan as-28- regards Sabban and Beni Atofya leaders. I attach importance to my being placed in a position to act as above notwithstanding High Commissioner’s confi dence in improbability of Akhwan invasion and in certainty of victory if it should take place. I do not myself think such invasion is imminent danger so long as situation in the South remains doubtful but the King if completely dis satisfied might resort to it later. Events of last summer proved that he can collect large forces of Akhwan when it suits him and that nothing would appeal to them so much as to be allowed to cross the frontier.Telegrams 1‘rom His majesty’s Minister, Jedda, Hog. 3 and 4 of the 5th January, 1933. (Beginning of ^R':) My telegram No. 2. I saw Fuad this morning. I reviewed the whole situation under following heads:- A. Rumours of Akhwan concentration which I heard here on my return and which were reaching Jerusalem even mere freely from frontier sources were disquieting. Though not instructed to make representations I should like to be able to reassure you and High Commissioner. B. Situation as regards ordinary tribal raiding had continued healthy In suite of perturbed frontier situation last year. C. It was all the more important that situation should not be imperilled by Akhwan who when mobilized formed part of /.ing's fighting forces (Fuad assented). tie had been informed of their mobilization last June and later of their dispersal. If there had been any fresh concentration it was in the King's intercut apar. from obligation under article 2 of Kadda Agreement .o infer His Majesty's Government of purpose and scope in order to dispel false impressions. D. Rven if rumours were false, as I supposed, their effect v.as unsettling in frontier districts. High Commissioner had suggested a meeting between Giubb Zeid, Without definitely pressing this buggestion considered that such meeting would have a calming effectre gardless of subjects discussed as it would prove to tribes that collaboration between frontier authorities was not dead. 2 ^ I was now authorised to communicate reply of -is Majesty’s Government to Saudi memorandum of October 13th at any convenient moment. X had decided to await outcome of present conversation but was myself disposed to make communication as soon as possible. It was desirable to show that agreement in principle reached in October was unaffected by extraneous events like develop ments in Asir. Recognition would have particularly good effect whether one adopted view that persons hostile to Ibn Saud were abusing Abdullah’s name or accepted (as I did not) extreme Saudi view that he was himself intriguing On either hypothesis it would dispose of idea that he might be regarded as potential claimant to Hejaz. Following was outcome of ensuing discussion: A. and C. Fuad admitted guardedly that there was some truth in reports but wished to consult the Ring before making definite statement. He promised uo do this on January 9th. Meanwhile he assured me positively that the King had no intention of attacking uansjo^dan. Concentration was purely defensive and was nece^sar^ view of rumours of possible incursions from xransjordan not of organised forces but of parties set on by agitators as were behind Asir revolt. m reply to question as to whether I could reassure him on subject, I asked Fuad to convey formal assurance to the King from me as British representative that I had no knowledge of anything which pointed to 01 obable incursions from Transjordan and that it was constant object of High Commissioner, acting in accordance Policy of His Majesty’s Government, to prevent anything that could disturb the peace. I said latter *£ r —oU—-31- this assurance was absolute and needed no confirmation from you but that I would seek confirmation of first part. I urged that concentration at Jauf even if intended as a measure of precaution was very different from concentra tion at Hail as Wadi Sirhan resembled a spearhead in the flank of Transjordan. Presence of Akhwan at a place like Jauf would be misinterpreted by tribes and was attended by danger of Akhwan themselves getting out of hand. D. Fuad said that the King had authorised Ibn Zeid to meet Glubb. Former was at or on the way to Qariyyat and would probably meet Glubb at Azrap. I said that if reports of preparations for incursions from Transjordan were definite, I should be glad to learn facts but that if they were mere rumours Ion Zeid and Glubb might compare notes and we would consider connexion between alleged conspiracies and any ascertained iacts later, E. I indicated to Faud from memory at his request main points of proposed communication. He did not comment on recognition procedure but harped on point that except in the case of treaty with Iraq Transjordan Government had not hitherto made their own agreements. I said that in our view that Government had treaty-making capacity but that note would clearly define responsibility of His Majesty’s Government in regard to treaties made by them. We agreed to postpone this discussion. Fuad suggested that I should not make communication until af^er our next meeting on January 9th. I acquiesced but said that it would be a great disappointment to me if I could not make it then and had to seek further inotructi owing to reluctance of Saudi Government to proceed.p ua( 3 . pf--f gi &gt; i &gt; c&gt;'t various tstci^Gs to scciisotiions of Q&amp;udi Government against Abdullah and others and once referred to Saudi memorandum of November 15th as marking 'intermediate stage' 1 in negotiations. I took the line that memoranda of November 15th and November 26th related to important matters v/hich v/ere engaging most serious attention of His Majesty’s Government but were neverthe less essentially the concern of British authorities who had in fact taken various steps to checie intrigues and were still pursuing this task. I repeated that recogni tion of Ibn Baud by Abdullah would be the best counter- agent of all. Fuad was full of recent meeting of Abdallah’s son and Shakir with three conspirators fresh from Asir including Tahir Addabbagh and Sabban. I out- 1 lined various measures taken at Aden and elsewnere without attempting formal enumeration. Fuad particularly asted for information about meeting just mentioned to which publicity had been given in Palestine press. (End of 'R') I had just had High Commissioner's telegram No. 3 to Colonial Office about this unfortunate meeting but preferred not to discuss it pending receipt of further information. I consider conversations satisfactory so far. If it suggests any further instructions may I have them by January 8th when Fuad returns from sieeca: In view categorical assurance I deprecate strong line about Akhwan ■ u-rr i-ta-M f^nc'P and census si on at present. we shall gain more y 1 if we can: (a) Satisfy Ibn Saud that strong line.has been taken with alien conspirators at least both in Palestine and Transjordan and (b) Get on with mutual recognition. . p-ffice Nos. 3 and 4, repeated Addressed to Foreign Otiice ... to Transjordan Nos. 4 and^JuNo* p^inTila, !

The Secretary of State fully egrees, and he knows that the High Commissioner shares his vi^w, as the import since of taking all steps that arc possible in th.^ circumstances to maintain friendly relations between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of Saudi Arabia, but Sir Phil-p Ounliffe-Lister cannot admit that there is justification the allegation that His Majesty's Government have tolerated the existence of intrigues in Transjordan against the peace ana stability of Saudi Arabia* On the contrary, ~n additio the action taken to prevent assistance from Transjordan teaching the insurgents under Ibn Rifada, active measu have been taken with a view to preventing, so far as possible, UH ^R SECRETARY Foreign office, -33-participation of persons in Transjordan in further movements against Itn Saud„ These db aeureo include the expulsion, with the concurrence of Ibn Saul, from Transjordan into Hejaz of certain sections of the Beni At 4 ya which were concerned in raids into Hejaz at the time of the Ihn Rifada Rehellion, and the imprisonment of Mohammed Ihn Parhon, one of the leaders of the Beni Atiya. Special precautions have also been taken which, ’t is hoped, will prevent the paramount Sheikh of the Beni Atiya and other persons specially hostile to Ihn Saud from taking any effective share in further intrigues against Ton Saud. Also Abdul Raouf Sahhan, previously one of the Amir's entourage, has been dismissed by the Amir, In addition, the last mentioned person and Sayoi Tahir bin Massoud al Dabbagh, Sayed Hussein Abdullah al Dabbcgh, Said Ahmed Abdullah Aishan and Sayed Abdul Aziz al Tayyar, who, together with the Amir Talal ana the Amir Shakir, as ported in the High Commissioner's despatch, Secret A of the 23rd of December, 1032, have been recently excluded from Palestine, have also, it has now been learnt, been excluded from Transjordan by order of the Amir. It seems to the Secretary of State undesirable in the interests both of His Majesty s Government and of Transjordan that the value of such action as it has t*en found possible to take should be discounted or minimised«&gt; 3, Sir John Simon has suggested 'chat further mea^ur^s should nevertheless be taken, namely i (!) that the High Commissioner should not miss - o r po rt »„, PC ”” forceful attitude regarding the Amir's suspected( 2 ) that the Anir Shakir should he dismissed from the post of President of the Beduin Control Board and appointed to no other pest, and preferably that he should te ordered to absent hinself from Transjordan; ( 3 ) that similar action should bo taken against Hamid Pasha el Y/adi; ( 4 ) tliat Hamid Kabariti should be -dismissed from the post of Mayor of Akaba* 4 0 As regards the first suggestion, Sir Philip Cunlif fe^Lister has no doubt that if adequate grounds should be afforded for the suspicion that the Amir, m spite of the warnings which he has received, is actively concerned in intrigues against Ibn Baud, the High Commissioner will lose no time in taking such steps ac he nay consider likely to bo most effective in the circumstances. Sir John Simon will, of course, appreciate that so long as the view is accepted that there can be no (question of deposing the Amir, it would be impolitic for the High Commissioner to use language suggesting a threat of deposition. This considera tion must be taken into account in forming any judgment upon the methods adopted by Sir Arthur Wauchope m hi^ convers tions and relations with the Amir. Sir Philip Cunliffe- Lister has entire confidence in Sir Arthur Wauchope as/strong administrator and a shrewd judge of men, and feel* thau it must be left to him to decide how he handles matters with Abdullah, and that it would be very unwise to attempt to dictate the method or language to be High Commissioner may think that in present circumstances courteous consideration for the Amir r s portion may h a tetter effect apee tte Mir the bint ml —pro-iciW! speech, the Secretary of State knows that ho -.an upon the High Commissioner taking up a more fore ^ when he feels that this would farther theend in viewo In eny oase 9 the Becretary of State is satisfied that the High Commissioner is in no way hampered, as regards any further action that it may ho thought necessary to take, hy the manner in which his conversations with the Amir have been conducted. 5 0 As regards the suggested dismissal of the Amir Shakir and of Hamid Pasha, the Secretary of State understands that the High Commissioner feels that the evidence hitherto produced ia inadequate for the action proposed. In the case of Shakir, there is the further objection that dismissal from the post of President of the Beduin Control Board might involve the abolition of the Board for lack of a suitable successor. This would be regrettable, as it is admitted that the Beard serves a useful purpose, and it is anticipated that when the reorganisation now contemplated is completed, its usefulness will be enhanced, and at the same time Shakir power, especially with regard to affairs which concern relations with the tribes of Baudi Arabia, will bo considerably restricted* If, however, it were considered necessary to take action against either of these persons, the Secretary of State considers that it would be Arcng to proceed with their dismissal without confronting them with a statement of the charges Drought against thorn and giving them an opportunity of answering those charges. 6 „ Should Bir John Simon desire to pursue this proposal, Sir Philip CTunliffe-Lister would welcome his suggestions as to the appropriate charges to be framed against both suspects. He would then bo prepared to consider further whether he should ask the High Commissioner to move in the matter.-57- 7 # As regards the Mayor of Akaha ? he would appear to 'be of minor importance 9 end it is understood that the quest!on of his dismissal was raised last summer hy the High Ooimnissioner* hut that the Air Officer Commandirg considered that the Mayor was a valuable source of info mat ion, and this remains true to-day« It seems unlikely that the dismissal of this official would have any appreciable effect upon Ibn Saud 5 and the Secretary of State would not be disposed to press for his dismissal, unless the Air Council concur and Sir John Simon has reason to think that it would really assist in reassuring Ibn Saud as to the attitude of His Majesty 1 s Governmento In that event, Sir ihilip Cunliffe~Lister would be prepared to ask the High Commissioner to re consider the natter 0 Go Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister fully appreciates the international aspect of the relations between Transjordan and Saudi Arabia, but his responsibilities in connection with Palestine and Transjordan make it necessary for him also to take fully into account the local position and the probable effect on relations between Transjordan on the one hand, and Palestine and His Majesty’s Government on the other, of any action which is proposed* The Amir Abdullah in the past has shown himself well -disposed personalty towards His Majesty Government, as is evidenced by his attitude during the Druse rebellion, and during the disturbances in Palestine of IS 29 , and there is no indication at the present time, so far as the Secretary of State is aware, of any disloyalty to His Majesty’s Government* Furthermore, the Amir has complied with all requests for official action made to him on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, including therecognition of I bn Sand as King of Saudi Arabia* So long as the Amir's personal loyalty to His Majesty 1 s Government, and his relations with the High Commissioner remain un impaired, there is reason to hope that he will conform his official acts to the friendly relations existing between His Majesty's Government and the Government of Saudi Arabia, and the High Commissioner can be relied upon to do his utmost to counteract the effects of any subterranean intrigues originating in Transjordan which may be discovered* But circumstances are such that it is hardly to be hoped ohat the Hashimite family, whether in Transjordan, Iraq, or elsewhere, can be completely reconciled to the usurpation of King Hussein 1 s kingdom, and it is not m the Secr'etary'of^ State's opinion practicable to ensure the complete suppression of intrigue w 9 0 I am to take this opportunity to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. E. 50/31/25 of the 4th January and to say that the Secretary of State is glad to learn -that His Majesty's Minister at Jedda has now been authorised to sound Iliad 'Hamza as to a me^tj.ng between Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeid to which the Secretary of State attaches importance. 10o Copies of this letter are being sent to the India Office, Air Ministry and Admiralty.

Fuad having taken the King’s instructions replied as follows today to my statement of January 5th. 1. His Majesty expressed thanks for my information regarding measures against conspirators and expressed the hope that they Fould be continued. I said action was being taken wherever His majesty’s Government had authority or could exercise influence and that I was awaiting fuller information about meeting Tahir a etc. v;ith the two Amirs. 2 a Akhwan. The King confirmed Fuad’s assurance that there was no hostile intention towards Transjordan. He had been per turbed by rumours of active hostilities himself and had in fact ordered out certain (? standards). There was hov/ever no present concentration either at Jauf or in Akhwan settlements. I asked whether this applied to Hail. Fuad said that forces there had gone south under Ibn Musaad who was now at Abha. I expressed gratification and said that I had had similarly reassuring in formation from High Commissioner (see his telegram No.4 to Colonial Office). 3. Proposed communication regarding recognition and treaty settlement. The King had considered position both as ruling country bordering on Transjordan and as friend of His Majesty’s Government with whom he wished to be on the best terms. Abdullah was member of dynasty of which he had been dispossessed. Judging-40- him ty his utterances he could not trust his promises unless they were hacKed hy His Majesty s Government. If his promises were so hacked the King was ready to receive communication. X said I would report this and make a communication on January 11 th, unless there were any hitch. I used calming language about utterances attributed to Abdullah and emphasised readiness always shown by His Majesty’s Government to recognise their responsibility for him. I said note should be judged by its terms which had been most carefully considered. 4 . Fuad reverted to rumours of hostile activity which had disturbed the King. After Beni Atiya crossed the frontier arrangements were made for them to see governor of Tabukj but at suggestion of certain instigators they had not done so and some had recrossed the frontier. I asked who instigators were and what numbers were said to have recrossed* Fuad replied they were understood to have received messages from some of their own people in Transjordan but did not know how many had gone back there. He believed Abu Dumeik to be at Mudawwara on Transjordan side* I said Beni Atiya were nuisance wherever they were and should be regarded as joint problem. I would enquire as to facts and would welcome further information from Saudi s i de. 5. Fuad offered to ejcpedite meeting of Glubb and Ibn Zeid if necessary. I said this would undoubtedly be in accordance with views of His Majesty’s Government and High Commissioner. He promised to telegraph again Ibn Zeid who should shortly reach Qariyyat, 6 . Fuad expressed regret that he had been unable to reply to protest mentioned in my telegram No.l. He hopes to do so shortly, (End of M R' r , ) Whole of King’s message was studiously conciliatory.

It is quite possible that Ibn Saud will stick out for definite participation of His Majesty’s Government in any treaty settlement* If so, I will use all my influence to secure acceptance of paragraph 2 of draft note, I expect to see Fuad again on January 13th or January 14th, Addressed to Foreign Office Nos, 7 and 8, repeated to Transjordan Nos, 10 and 11, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.l c 12 th January, 1933.C RJLI HtTu 7 COPY NOo qoMi'irr TES of imperial defe nce, RTAILING OFFICIAL SUB~COMMI Tm FO R aUEGTIONC CONCERNING' THE MIDDLE EAST o TRANSJO R DAN - SA.UDI ARABIA . paraphrase Telegram from the Acting High Commiesioner for Transjordan to the Secretary of State for the Colonies* dated 10th January* 193S© ) Whitehall Gardens* S.Wel 16th January* 1933©Trun a-Jordan to.the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

On the 1st December Hamid Pasha el Wadi left for Baghdad whither he had been urgently summoned by his Drother. Before he left I had an opportunity of seeing his passport which gives no evidence of his presence in Prance in July last and goes to shew therefore that probably the story of his buying arms in the St .Etienne factory, near Marseilles, is without foundation. 2 . The reports from Royal Air Force sources that the Amirs Talal and Shaker called on Taher Dabbagh in Jerusalem and next day took him in the Amir T s car to Jaffa to meet Ali Dabbagh, as well as the report that Taher Dabbagh had spent the night of the 19 th/ 20 th in Amman on his way to Baghdad are inaccurate and misieadirig. The facts are, I believe, as follows:- On or before the 13 th December the Amir Talal informed me that he and Shaker were going on a jaunt to Jerusalem and stay at the Modern Hotel, provided the Amir did not wish to take them with him on his forthcoming trip to Kerak. They went to Jerusalem in the afternoon of the 15 th. Taher Dabbagh had arrived in Jerusalem on the 14 th, having been hurried out of Cairo where he had arrived on • -- e and was also a guest at the Modern Hotel. It is quite possible and even probable that Shakir knew iaher was Jerusalem before he left Amman but I a m fully persuaded that he did not know Taher would be there when the visit was first planned. It would, in my opinion* be wrong to/to seriously blame Shaker for this meeting for to allow Taher Dabbagh to be in Palestine is equivalent to putting cheese before a mouse. The journey to Jaffa did not take place and the man All Dabbagh was not seen. As regards Taher Dabbagi^s visit to Amman, it is believed that Taher failed to get a visa from the French Consulate in Jerusalem to enable him to pass through Syria on his way to Baghdad, so he travelled in the mail convoy via Amman, where he arrived on the 19 th and, after making the usual pause for refuelling, proceeded on his journey within an hour of his arrival. The Amir himself was absent from Amman at the time and did not see him. j,. Following on these events the Amir has issued orders, at the request of His Excellency the High Commissioner, that the follow, ng persons are to be excluded from Trans-Jordan:- ABDUL RAOUF SABBAN TAHER DABBAGH HUSSEIN DABBAGH AHMED ABDULLA AI SHAN ABOUL AZIZ EL TAYYAR OSMAN EL ARAB In agreeing to issue this order the Amir has complained bitterly that men like Neoih el Azmeh, who was ejected from Trans-Jordan in 1924# are allowed to live in Palestine and sling mud at him in the papers. 4. Locally collected information has tended to confirm the report received at Jedda that Ion Saoud intended to send Akhwan forces to his frontier with Trans-Jordan. His followers have been reported oy Ion\2J^) v y Saoud to be in a dangerous frame of mind and so hostile to the Amir Abdullah that the King doubted his ability to hold them in check. It would appear essential to ensure, in the interests of peace, that so explosive a body be kept at a distance from the frontier, but it is held that a demand to this end cannot properly be made because Ibn Saoud has accused Abdullah of responsibility for the rebellion in Asir; he has offered no proofs in support of this accusation. Fortunately, the latest information is to the effect that the concentration is not to approach the frontier and our Beduin may thus escape the alarms and the almost certain raids to which they would otherwise have been exposed. These rumours have also caused some alarm to the responsible officials of the Iraq Petroleum Company who have scattered parties working along the pipe line. They have been advised not to withdraw and a wireless has been placed by the Royal Air Force in one of the I.P.C. camps which lies some 9^ miles east of Azraq. 5. On the 7 th December, His Excellency the High Commissioner flew to Amman and impressed on the Amir the urgent need to hold himself entirely aloof from affairs and persons in Saoudi Arabia during the present difficult time. His Excellency returned to Jerusalem after lunching with the Amir.Holes. jlinute Paper. Register No. P. z. 7437 / 33 . / ^ -L SECRET. POLITICAL DEPARTMENT Dated Rec. 19 Date. Initials.

So drastic a Ptep as the removal of the Amir Abdullah was consiaered undesirable for the reasons given in para. 3 of the Foreign Office letter at P.Z.7300,but the High Commissioner was ashed to ,T consider the possibility of really strong representations to the &gt;jair ,r and, if possible, to take drastic action against suspected members of his entourage, particuarly the Amir Shakir (P.Z.7326). From the account now received of Sir A.Wauchope f s interview with Aladullah, he seems to have ta^en, in ohe circumstances, a somewhat gentle line wUh him. Abdullah was his usual plausible sell ana aeniea having written any letters to people in the Hejaz for/for a long time, and all knowledge of Ali Dabbagh. bir A. Wauchope had already telegraphed (7401) that there seemed no direct evidence to justify firm action &gt; against Shakir, but he maue Abdullah promise to give him a warning. The authorities in Transjordan all consider the danger of incursions by Ibn Baud's Ikhwan to be remote, and in any case not a formidable one, Abdullah's general account in para. 7 of t.Z.7437 of his feelings towards Ibn Saud (and oi the latter’s unpopularity) is interesting but does not accord well with the ''fairly reliable :T information at P.Z.7308 concerning his recent meeting with Feisal,when the latter is said to have reproached him for his clumsiness in helping Ibn Aifada but to have approved his intrigues against Ibn Saud in principle. A reply will now presumably be sent to the oaudi memorandum on the lines suggested in para, o ol the Foreign Office letter at P.Z.7300, but it is unfor tunate,though perhaps natural, that the Transjordan authorities and the legation at Jedda look at this question fromi.such widely different angles.

Mr. Hope-Gill has received inTormation reportea rr for what it may be worth 1 ’ from a source recently ’’unusually reliable ’ that the Saudis have captured letters from Abdullah himself to Ali Dabbagh - in other words that he is implicated in the Asir revolt (P.Z.7204). Ibn Saud appears to be seriously alarmed at the prospect of more trouble in the North, and has addressed to H.M.G. a memoi &lt; ndum exhortingthem to,bestir themselves against the conspir gtors in Transjordan anti threatening the JU with the uncontrollability oi his I Ah wan (P.Z.7203) which he intenus apparently to move northwards - a step, which, ix not alreauy tamen, would in any case almost certainlyresult in dangsrous incursions into Transjordan. Mr. Hope-Gill thinlisthat the King is genuinely alarmed and suggests that the time has come for H.M.G. to tahe a strong line about Abaullah, who will, in his opinion, be unable ever to live at peace with Ibn Saud. It is understood that the Departments concerned are awaiting more positive proof of his complicity before considering the line they will tahe. Meanwhile, in Asir, the insurgents seem to be holding their own.

Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received August 18.) (No. 330.) Sir, Jedda, August 2, 1932. I AM sending you by this bag a general report on matters connected with the Transjordan frontier situation. 1 prefer to deal separately with my conversations with Sheikh Yussuf Yasin on the evening of the 31st July and morning of the 1st August in amplification of my telegram No. 144 of the latter date, relative to the proposed intervention of King Feisal as an intermediary between Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah. I should say at the outset that the Amir Feisal seems either to have attached little importance to the suggestion of the King of Iraq or to have been very discreet, as Sheikh Yussuf clearly knew nothing of it and gave me the impression on the 1st August that the King had heard little or nothing at all, notwithstanding the fact that Fuad Bey Hamza returned to Taif on the 24th July. I see by a recent despatch from Bagdad that the Amir Feisal is thought to have had too much of Fuad Bey’s bumptiousness during their tour. This may be the explanation. 2. I went to see Sheikh Yussuf on the evening of the 31st July, intending to make a short communication. Finding him ignorant, I had ( to explain the matter fully. His immediate personal reaction was favourable. “ As an Arab,” he found the suggestion attractive. Indeed, he was so spontaneous in this sense, that he felt later that he had sounded too forthcoming and emphasised the need for consultation with the King. I took advantage of his attitude to add nry own embroidery to the bare communication of the views of His Majesty s Government. I said that I myself had at first been doubtful, as 1 did not know how Ibn Saud would like the idea of applying to King Feisal and it might also be thought that His Majesty’s Government were evading the task of bringing the former and the Amir Abdullah together. I had come to the conclusion on reflection that the proposal presented many advantages. His Majesty s Government were anxious for a settlement but had not concealed the fact that there were difficulties, ® general nature of which I had indicated a few days before. King leisa cou play a very useful role, as he could approach the Amir Abdullah m qui e a different way from His Majesty’s Government, as a brother and not as a direc mg authority q Qv,«mv, Fho cnhippt nf the status of Transjordan andhe would be arriving quite soon. I agreed that it would be reasonable to await him Presently, 1 discovered a larger lly in the ointment, the King had said m his~telegram that he would wish not only to consult his son, but also to exchange views on certain undefined preliminary points with His Majesty's Government. I exerted myself to show that this would merely complicate the matter. I pointed out that we were now only concerned with a promising approach to the questions which would need discussion later. The sheikh promised to go into the matter fully with the King, with whom he had so far only exchanged short telegrams. In order to reinforce what I had said, I asked his permission to give him a purely personal statement of a general kind. I had begun to think seriously, I said, of the possibility of a settlement between Hejaz Kejd and Transjordan when the very difficult task of a settlement between Hejaz-Nejd and Iraq had been completed in the spring of last year. I did not then know what the views of Ibn Saud would be, but when the Hejazi Government had first expressed a wish for a similar settlement with Transjordan last autumn, I had considered the matter further, had seen the difficulties and had concluded that such a settlement should be regarded as a definite objective though it might take time. The visit of the Hejazi mission to London had given the matter a new impetus. The Ibn Rifada affair had given it a further impetus, because, while His Majesty’s Government had insfsted that it was independent of the immediate issues created bv that affair it had intensified the study which had been promised in London. ^ 5 I added that the Ibn Rifada affair had also had a disadvantage. It had caused the Hejazi Government to press very hard a question of responsibility, with special reference to the Amir Abdullah. I had told Sheikh Yussuf Yasin and I told him again that in my opinion insistence on the question of responsi bility miMit prejudice the chances of a general settlement. If two rulers (and the Amir was a ruler, though not so great a one as Ibn Saud or his brother Feisal) were to be brought together, it was a very bad beginning for one of them to bring accusations, however justified he might himself consider them, against the other. In any case, I thought that a pursuit of the question of responsibilities would lead nowhere, if only because every public act of the Amir Abdullah throughout the Ibn Rifada business had been eminently correct and because there were many people who might like to upset the present regime in this country without wanting to bring the shereefs back to it. . , 6 Sheikh Yussuf Yasin listened with great care, thanked me and promised to lay all I had said before the King. I realise that in discussing all the elements in the question, viz., the difficulties in the way of a treaty settlement between Hejaz-Nejd and Transjordan, the question of responsibility for recent events and the reasons for supporting King FeisaTs suggestion, I have gone a long way beyond my instructions and that, even when careful to express personal views only, I may be taken to be interpreting the mind of His Majesty’s Government. I am convinced that the use of such language as I have employed affords the best means of overcoming Hejazi suspicion and of influencing Ibn Baud in the only way in which I can at present influence him, i.e., through Sheikh Yussuf. My recen intimacy with the latter has been of distinct advantage, not that he is always easy to handle, but because he has a simpler nature than that of Fuad Bey and is more completely in the King’s confidence. For these reasons I ask your indulgence, i I should seem to have talked too much or too openly. . &gt; tt h 7.

I said I would report this and make a communication on January 11th, unless there were any hitch. I used calming language about utterances attributed to Abdullah end emphasized readiness always shown by His Majesty's Govornment to recognize their responsibility for him. I said note should be judged by its terms which had been most carefully considered. 4. Fuad reverted to rumours of hostile activity which had disturbed the King. After Bsnl Atiya crossed the frontier arrangements were made for than to see governor of Tabuk but at suggestion of certain instigators they had not done so end some had rocroesed the frontier. I asked who instigators Yfere and what numbers were said to have re~ crossed. Fuad replied they were understood to have received messages from some of their own people in Trans jordan but did not know how many had gone back there. He believed Abu Duneik to be at Mudawwara on Transjordan side. • I said Beni Atlye were Nuisance wherever they were end should be regarded as joint problem. I would enquire as bo facts and would welcome further information from ^audi side. 5. Fuad offered to expedite meeting of Glubb end Ibn Zeld if necessary. I said this would undoubtedly accordance with views of His Majesty's Government and high Commissioner. He promised to telegraph again xbn Zeid should, shortly reach Qariyy&amp;t*5. Fuad expreeeed regret th?t he lied been unable to reply to protest mentioned in my telegram i'o. 1 . He hooee to do bo shortly* (hnd of 'H '.) Whole of King's message was studiously conciliatory. Even as regards Abdullah his present attituue seems to be rather to manifest continued mistrust than to refuse negotiatione with S On my side whilst speaking freely of activities of Addebbngh, Sabben, etc. I have avoided anything in the nature of admission of complicity of Abdullah or persons of his entourage other than Sabben. I win send note on January 11th unless High Commissioner's observations on my telegrams Nos. 3 and 4 make delay necessary. I am most anxious to get on with this stage. It is suite possible that Ibn Saud will stick out for definite participation of His Majesty's Government in any treaty settlement. If so, I will use all :ny influence to secure acceptance of paragraph 2 of draft note. I expect to see Fuad again on January 13th or January 14th.

My telegram No. 2 0 ^ ^ I saw Fuad this mcrning 0 I reviewed the whole situ at; on under following lisais:- A. Humours of Akhwan concentration which I heard hero on my return and which were reaching Jerusalem even more freely from frontier sources were disquieting. Though not instructed to make representations I should like to oe able to reassure you and High Commissioner* B, Situation as regards ordinary tribal raiding had continued healthy in spite of perturbed frontier situation last year* C, It was all the more important that situation should not be imperilled by Akhwan who when mobilized formed part of King’s fighting forces (Fuad assented). We had been informed of their mobilization last June and lat^r of their dispersal. If there had been any fresh concentration it was in the King’s interest apart from his obligation under Article 2 of Hadda Agreement to inform Wis Majesty’s Government of purpose and scope in order to dispel false impressions. ^ Even if rumours were false, as I supposed, their -iect was unsettling in frontier districts. High Commissioner • • »2, Commissioner had suggested a meeting between Glubb and Ibn Zeido Without definitely pressing this suggestion I considered that such meeting would have a calming effect regardless of subjects discussed as it would prove to tribes that collaboration between frontier authorities was not dead. E. I was now authorised to communicate reply of His Majesty’s Government to Saudi memorandum of October 13th at any convenient moment. I had decided to await outcome of present conversation but was myself disposed to make coimrjuiication as soon as possible. It was desirable to show that agreement in principle reached, in October was unaffected by extraneous events like develop ments in Asir. Recognition would have particularly good effect v;hether one adopted view that persons hostile to Ibn Saud were abusing Abdullah’s name or accepted (as I did not) extreme Saudi view that he was himself intriguing. On either hypothesis it would dispose of idea that he might be regarded as potential claimant to Hejaz. Following was outcome of ensuing discussion: A e and C. Fuad admitted guardedly that there was some truth in reports but wished to consult the King before making definite statement. He promised co d^ this on January 9th. Meanwhile he assured me pouiuiv^-ly that the King had no intention of attacking Transjordan. Concentration was purely defensive and was necessary In view of rumours of possible incursions from Transjordan hot of organised forces but of parties seu on by same agitators as were behind Asir revolt. In reply'to Question as to whether I could reassure him on this subject, ...S' 3. subject, I asked Fuad to convey formal assurance to the King from me as British representative that I had no knowledge of anything which pointed to probable incursions from Transjordan and that it was constant object of High Commissioner, acting in accordance with policy of His Majesty’s Government, to prevent anything that could disturb the peace• I said latter part of this assurance was absolute and needed no confirmation from you but that 1 would seek confirmation of first parto I urged that concentration at Jauf even if intended as a measure of precaution was very different from concentra tion at Hail as Wadi Sirhan resembled a spearhead in the flank of Transjordan. Presence of Akhwan at a place like Jauf would be misinterpreted by tribes and was attended by danger of Akhwan themselves getting out of hand. D 0 Fuad said that the King had authorised Ibn Zeid to meet Glubb 0 Former was at or on the way to Qariyyat and would probably meet Glubb at Azraq. I said that if reports of preparations for incursions from Transjordan were definite, I should be glad to learn facts cut that if they were mere rumours Ibn Seid and Glubb might compare ^ notes and we would consider connexion between alleged conspiracies and any ascertained facts later. E» I indicated to Fuad from memory at mis rspues u main points of proposed communication. He did noo comment on recognition procedure but harpod on point that except in the case of treaty with Iraq Transjordan Government had not hitherto made their own agreements. I said that in our ... liour view that Government had treaty-making capacity 'cut that note would clearly define responsibility of His Majesty’s Government in regard to treaties made 'ey them. We agreed to postpone this discussion. Fuad suggested that I should not make communication until after our next meeting on January 9th* I acquiesced hut said that it would he a great disappointment to me if I could not make it then and had to seek further instructions owing to reluctance of Saudi Government to proceed. Fuad referred at various stages to accusations of Saudi Government against Abdullah and others and once referred to Saudi memorandum of November loth as marking '’Intermediate stage' in negotiations. I took the line that memoranda of November 15th and November 26th related to important matters which were engaging most serious attention of His majesty’s Government but were neverthe less essentially the concern of British authorities who had in fact taken various steps to check intrigues and were still pursuing this task. I repeated that recogni tion of Ton Baud by Abdullah would be the best counter- agent of all. Fuad was full of recent meeting of Abdullah’s son and Shakir with three conspirators fres^ from Asir including Tahir Addabbagh ana S abb an. I out lined various measures taken at Men end elsewhere without attempting formal enumeration. Fuad particularly for information about meeting jusu mentioned which publicity had been given in Palestine press. (End of ”3\) I had just had nifih. Comrissioner's telegram No. o to Colonial ...Colonial Office about this unfortunate meeting but preferred not to discuss it pending receipt of further information. I consider conversations satisfactory so far. If It suggests any further instructions may I have them by January 8 th when Fuad returns from Mecca? In view of his categorical assurance I deprecate strong line abouu Akhwan at present. We shall gain more by patience and persuasion if we can: (a) Satisfy Itn Saud that strong line has been taken with alien conspirators at least doth in Palestine and Transjordan and (b) Get on with mutual recognition.

I think however that it would be useful if I reviewed the whole situation orally with Fuad at the earliest opportunity. I could speak of disquieting effect of current rumours, enquire as to Akhwan position and if you saw no objection sound him as to possibility of meeting between .Glubb and Ibn Zeid without definitely proposing it. This action would be still more useful if I could indicate present attitude of His Majesty’s Government regarding recognition and treaty negotiations (see my 227). It might be advisable to address carefully worded personal letter to Fuad on similar lines to above if his return to Jedda should be delayed beyond early part of next week.

Should High Commissioner for Transjordan telegraph that he has definite information that concentration of A&amp;hwan near Transjordan frontier has taken place and that there is in his opinion serious and immediate danger of large scale incursions into Transjordan, oircumstances might be such as to render issue of warning to Saudi government contemplated in second sentence of above telegram ihatter of great urgency.

Secret. Treaty between Trans Jordan and Saudi Arabia, Reference your Secret despatch November 24th. It is recommended by British Resident that in proposed comnunication to Saudi Government, Amir Abdullah should be referred to as 'Amir of the State of Trans-Jordan', This would be mere in accordance with wording of Trar»-Jordan Agreement of 1928 and difficulty of finding a satisfactory translation of word 'Ruler' in formula originally proposed would be overcome. As regards title of Ibn Saud it is thought by British Resident that recognition as 'King of Saudi Arab Kingdom consisting of Hejaz and Nejd and its dependencies as? proposed by Ibn Saud in memorandun forwarded under Fuad Hamza's letter of 13th October No. 7/2 would be less acceptable to the Amir than phrase 'King of Saudi Arabia*' used in Memorandum transmit? 3d to the Saudi Government by His Majesty v e Charge d Affaires at Jeddah on October 6th 1932 and it is reconmended that the latter expression which is official title of kingdom should oa retain d. 1 concur in the tenns of dmft reply to Ibn Saud subject to consideration of these two points.

I still remain of opinion that no Akhwan concentration of any great importance lias taken place. I am in agreement with Glubb that Akhwan may move nearer to our frontier so as to impress tribes in Northern Hejaz. I see no reason to believe that it is their intention to cross our frontier. I have reason to believe that Ibn Saud, certainly up to December 22nd, was opposed to any raid near Trans-Jordan frontier and that he was in favour of a meeting being arranged between Glubb and Ibn Zell.

It would be preferable to forestall the risk of an Akhwan incursion by strong representations to Ibn Sand. But it is considered by the Foreign Office that to make any representations would be useless until His Majesty’s Government can clear themselves of the reiterated chargee male by Ibn Sand regarding the failure to counteract anti-Saudi intrigues in Trans Jordan which Ibn Sand has contended have seriously exasperated his followers and made them difficult to restrain. For similar reasons Foreign Office think it useless to attempt to bring about a meeting between Ibn &amp;eid and Glubb. The position remains therefore as indicated in my telegram No.167 and you will of course at once report (repeating to Jedda) if definite information is obtained by you as to Akhwan concentration in vicinity of Trans Jordan frontier and you are satisfied that large scale incursion is probable so that warning may then be given to Saudi Government* '■IRE IN WEEKLY LETTER FROTi l CRETARY, POLITICAL SECKEt DEPT.

A rumour han reached me of a concentntion of Akhwan forces at Hail. 1 have also received a report, which is unverified, that there are many Akhwan forces with standards arriving at Jauf. The reliability of tnia latter report which* emanates from a desert patrol post at Bair is at present being further investigated. ifc’hile any remonstrance to the Government of Saudi Arabia would at the moment be unjustified in view of the insufficient evidence of the reliability of the information. I should, nevertheless, be glad if reprerentations of a friendly nature could be made in the manner your telegram a urges t*« &gt; Further, ft meeting at an early date between Giubb and Ibn 2a*d at Bair or^Lsraq would allay suspicions and fears on both sides. Ibn Zaid has not replied to Giubb f s written request, sent at the commencement of the present month, for an interview. A request should, I suggest, be addressed to the Government of Saudi Arabia asking ^ i 88Ue instructions ^ accordingly to Ibn Zaid. It is, in my opinion, unlikely that an incurs ion of Akhwan will take place. Further, if it did, ita repulse could be effected, I consider, without difficulty* Nevertheless 1 ^ in agreement with the view which Giubb has expressed that it ia possible that the Akhwan may occupy Wady Sirhan and trial in the event of such occupation considerable unrest among certain Trans -Jo rdan tribes will certainly be caused thereby*98050/32. 7854 * 93 2 PAR/iPHRAoE telegram from the Secretaiy of State for the Colonies to the High Commissioner for Trans Jordan, (oent 7#o0 p*m* 23rd December 1932). Addressed to Trans Jordan Bo.167. His uajesty r s uove.miiBnt have been considering the situation \7hich would arise in the event of Akhwan concentrating in the neighbourhood of the Trans Jordan frontier and the consequent possibility of incursions into Trans Jordan. If such a concentration were actually to take place and large-scale incursions into Trans Jordan appeared probable. His i]ajesty T s Government would, in view of the fact that the Akhwan can properly be regarded as Ibn Sand’s fighting forces, be prepared to warn the Saudi Government through His Majesty’s Minister at Jeddah, that such incursions would be held to constitute a breach of Articles 2 and 10 of the Hadda Agreement, absolving His Majesty’s Goveinment from their obligations under the Agreement in the particular case and entitling, in case of necessity, the forces in Trans Jordan to pursue the Akhwan on to Saudi territory. On the assumption that contact with Saudi forces might be effected only in the immediate vicinity of the frontier the Air Council are of opinion that the depth to which pursuit might reasonably be carried would be governed by the distance vdiich Saudi forces were able to travel during remaining hours oi daylight.

I said that B'ni Atiya had causod certain troubles during last fou iiionths and I recognised that Abdullah had given every assistance to the British Resident in removing bulk of Beni Atiya from frans Jordan to the He jag. 1 however considered that Sheikh Selim Abu ; 'Ctaoi paraanount Sheikh ol Beni Atiya was one who possibly might foment trouble and I therefore considered Abu Domeik should leave Trans Jord-an for the present and live in Beorsheba district until (corrupt group) are quiet in Hodjas. 1 also considered Earayin Ibn Atiya who I aji now inforued is another Sheikh hostile to Ibn Saud and in close touch with Amir should also leave 'Trans Jordan and reside in Palestine. 5. Amir replied that ho had always agreed to carrv out any. wishes of His majesty's Govermient which I had put to him although ho personally saw no reason to mistrust Abu Domeik or Earayin he would be quite ready do give orders that they should live in Palos l ino for the present. The British } esiornt and Captain dlubb would see that his orders were carried out- 6. I then said there ware rumours that kaix Shaker was in touch v;i th disturbers of the peace 5n Hedjag and 1 requested Abdullah to tell Shaker tliut he must be most careful to srhow that he woula giro no support to any such people* The Aair said be. ,/oul * bu willing to 'speak to Shah dr to this • or- 's Shaker’s family was resident in Hedjaz worn 1 anything ’.muse aa that v. r ould y &lt; ^ gettinggetting into trouble, part 3 begins. 7. I asked Abdullah for his vieus on present situation in oaudi Arabia. He said his views peuj&amp;rned unchanged, nariely that I bn baud was unpopular that Sheikh of Koweit, the family of I bn Rashid and neople of Asir were all anxious to achieve overthrow of I bn Sand, thab it was natural for Ibn Saul in this dii i icu.lt time to believe that some of intriguer were due to Abdullah and- that it was even possible for enemies of Ibn Saud in order to strengthen their position, to say that Abdullah was working for them but that this was untrue. Ho knew his interests lay with the British Government he had given his promise not to work against Ibn Saud and he would keep that promise. It'was true that Ibn baud had behaved very badly to his family but people of Saudi’Arabia had not asked him to go into that country and he had no inclination to mix himself in their poll tics- He had in fact agreed to rocogaise Ibn baud. I said that I was sura that he would realise the serious nature of our conversation and I would inform my Gcverniw •' • t/• t I fully accepted his promise of good faith. 8. The British Resident told me yesterday that the Executive and Legislative Councils wished th- nmit to demand considerable c h inges in the Agreement o.l Realizing the seriousness of the subject which we had been discussing the Amir put forward no request regarding the Agreement. 1 consider the time- unsuibdole for making any material changes in the Agreement* 9. 1 agree with Colonel Cox one Captain Glubb inhoi thinking the possibiliiy of large body of Akhwan crossing' the ?rahs Jordan frontier to be srtremely remote. I agree with Air Officer Commanding that if they cross the frontier we shall be able to drive them back with little'difficulty. His Majesty's Government neea havo Little apprehension on this score.

Addressed to Trans Jordan No«165. Repeated to Jedda No.151. Jedda telegram No*215 to Foreign Office repeated to you as No.276. His Majesty's Chargfi d k i\ffaires at Jedda reports to following effect. Begins* Saudi Government’s latest raemoran«ur shows definite signs of being inspired by Ibn Saud personally, and althou^i nr- reference is made to captured correspondence between Abdullah and rebels (see paragraph 7 of Jedda telegram Mo.214) it may well be 'iaeed upon such correspondence since it is clear that evidence is sufficiently serious to make ibn Saud feel justified in hinting at possible action by .Jchwan, Combination of spread of Asir revolt obviously supported from abroad* and of disquieting news from north {e.g. possible combination of Xtameik and Nuri Shalan) appears to have convinced Ibn Saud that intriguers in Transjordan are again active and that Abdullah xe planning yet another vicarious aggression. Ibn baud* who is already exasperated by apparent inability of His Majesty’s government to control these intriguenow seenis likely to try to icrep-tali any further incursion by having Akhwan ready to hand. Latest ^ocal information is that Ibn Musaad of Hail has now been in command of Akhwan concentrations. Ends* 2* Present situation, in which Akhwan m;,y, with or Without Ibn Baud’s tacit appi^ovaJ, tiAts the jaw into their rwn handsA If 12 haiKls by attacking ij'ajnsJordan, is one of aet'iouB danger 0 Continuance of position Us wnich Hie Majesty's Government cannot ^eny aocueations of hostile activxtieB which Ibn Saud has made against Abdulian and 'iis associates in Transjordan* is embarrassing and i©iominious. In any case, unless radical steps are taken to remedy situation in near iuture, relations between Hie Majesty*c Government and Ibn 3aud are likely to become so difficult as not only to lead to increasingly serious friction on Transjordan frontier, but to prejudice British interests throughout Middle Saste 3« In these circumstances I shall be glad if you will consider possibility of really strong representations to Amir drawing his attention to rumours of his alleged complicity in Asir rising and urging upon him with all force at your command necessity of complete cassation of any comuaications which he or his associates may still be holding with persons involved in rebellio s activities against Ibn Baud. 4* It at) so seems desirable that immediate drastic action should be taken against those in Transjordan in the case o whom there is definite evidence of complicity in piote against Ibn Saud, more especially if poasible those in immediate vicinity of Amir, and in particular Amir Shakir* Such action, if sufficiently severe would prot/ide Hie Majesty's Government with some material for reply to memorandum summariBBci in Jsdca telegra No*215 to Foreign Office, and might prevent situation from becoming even more dangerous* 5, Assuming that you are able to take actior in accordance with the above suggestions. His Majesty's Govemneni contemplate reply to Saudi Government on following nneE n They will hold Saudi Governaent responsible for consequences of any^hostile activities againet iransjordan by Akhwan, and will use all available means to repel them, (b) Saudi Government will be loomed of action ^adon you on paragraphs 3 and 4 above &lt; (c) any suitable infoAiiicvtion on other specific measures which you jnay have taken hi iranejardan to prevent assistance to possible anti -Saudi oonspi-^ fet'or'Bg in case of i?oni Atiya* could also L )iaDunicatel 9 together wit': details of measures already taken at C( Aden.P.Z. 7300 / 32 . el /76/25. 1st December, 1932. Sir, With reference to Foreign Office letter No.E.6261/76/^5 of November 30, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to inform Secretary Sir P. Cunliffe Lister that he has had under consideration the recent telegrams from His Majesty s Charge d Affaires at Jedda, ending with his telegram No.217 of the 29th November regarding the representations made by the Government of Saudi Arabia on the subject of the complicity of the Amir Abdullah, other members of the Sherifian family, and persons in Transjordan, in intrigues against King Ibn Saud and the existing rdgirae in Saudi Arabia. 2. Sir John Simon is in general agreement with the analysis of King Ibn Saud’s outlook in the matter contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Mr. Hope Gill^ telegram No.216 of 29th November and considers that, if it is true, as appears likely, that a concentration of the Akhwan has tdt en or is taking place in the direction of the Transjordan frontier, only some definite action of a nature to allay King Abdul Azir's exasperation at the apparent unwillingness or inability of His Majesty’s Government to check the continuance of intrigues in Transjordan against himself will suffice to avert an exceedingly grave situation with a serious risk of armed incursions by the Akhwan into Transjordan. 3. As Sir Philip Cunliffe Lister is aware, Sir John Simon has for long considered that the situation, m which His Majesty’s Government are placed by their inability to deny the accusations of hostile activities which King Ibn Saud has made against the Amir Abdullah and others in Transjordan, is not/ •^er Secretary of State, Colonial Office.not only embarrassing and ignominious, but prejudicial to their own wider interests. It was, however, decided when the possibility oj remedying this situation was considered in connexicn with the Amir's suspected complicity in the Ibn Rifada rebellion and on the receipt of King Ibn Baud’s secret memorandum of* the 6th August, (a copy of which was enclosed in Foreign Office letter No.E.4394/1241/25 of the 10th October) that such a drastic step as the removal of the Amir from his position as ruler of Transjordan was undesirable on other grounds, at any rate at the present stage, and that in any case such action should not be taken as a direct result of pressure from King Ibn Baud nor in default of direct evidence of the truth of the accusations made against him by that Monarch, which could be published. No sufficient evidence of a publishable nature appears yet to have been adduced against the Amir; while the recent communications of the Saudi Government are not only directed to securing the Amir Abdullah’s removal, but have contained veiled threats of action against Transjordan by armed forces. Sir John Simon therefore does not desire to suggest that the question of the removal of the Amir should again be considered at this juncture. He trusts, however, that Sir Philip Cunliffe Lister will agree to consult the High Commissioner for Transjordan at once as to the possibility of taking immediate and effective action of a forcible nature with the Amir designed to bring about a complete cessation of any communications which he or his associates may still be holding with persons involved in rebellious activities against King Ibn Baud. 4. Further, Sir John Simon considers it most desirable that immediate action, of as drastic a nature as may be possible, should be taken against those in Transjordan in the case of whom there is evidence of complicity in the plots against king Ibn Saud - more particularly those in the immediate vicinity of the Ami r/Amir and notably the Amir Shakir. Since Sir A. Wauchope has already been requested, in Colonial Office telegram No. 164 of the 26th November to expedite his views on this question, which has long been under discussion, immediate action in the matter will. Sir John Simon trusts, be possible. X am, however) to suggest for Sir P. Cunliffe Lister’s consideration that a further telegram be sent to Sir A. Wauchope, pointing out to him that immediate action against the persons concerned - and especially the Amir Shakir - if sufficiently severe, will provide His Majesty’s G-overnment with some material for a reply to tte memorandum from the Saudi Government summarised in Mr. Hope Gili’j telegram No.215 of the 27th November. 5. If a satisfactory reply is received from Sir Arthur Wauchope on the above points, Sir John Simon will be prepared to send instructions to Mr. Hope Gill to reply to the Saudi Government on the following lines (a) His Majesty’s Government will hold the Saudi Government responsible for any consequences which may ensue from hostile activities on the part of the AKhwan against Transjordan and will use every means at their disposal to repel them. (b) The Saudi Government will be informed of the punitive action taken against the Amir Shakir and others in Transjordan involved in complicity in the Ibn Rifada rebellion, the Dabbagh plots etc. (c) The Saudi Government will be given any suitable information of other specific measures taken in Transjordan prevent assistance being given to possible rebellious movements in Saudi Arabia, e.g. measures taken as a result of Colonial Office telegram to Sir A. Wauchope No.163 of the 25th November, regarding the Beni Atiya tribe. The nature of the steps taken previously to prevent the use of the Aden Protectorate by those Plotting against Ibn Baud in Asir or elsewhere and of any additional steps which the Resident at Aden may report as a result/result of Colonial Office telegram to him No.38 of the 26th November could also be communicated to the Saudi Government at the same time, ^ 6 .

Reference is invited to paragraphs 1, 5 and 6 of the memorandum accompanying my despatch dated 27th July 1932 No.140. it may be that Saudi an allegation relates to activities of individual mentioned therein. Bir Ali was duly warned to sever his connection with conspirators ae stated in paragraph £9 of second memorandum accompanying my despatch dated 3rd August 1932 No. 144. He denied complicity in plot and his participation in it was not proved. There ie no more recent information in my possession of anti-Saudian movement at Mukaila or on Hadxamaut coast but I am making further enquiries. Can you please say from where rifles are alleged to have been smuggled into Mukalla? My information is to the effect that arms frequently pass from Yemen overland to Hadramaut but not in reverse. As regards imports of arms into Mukalla by sea, will you please refer to my confidential despatch of 17th February 1932 No.28 forwarding copy of communication to iiis Majesty’s Consul- General Batavia who arranged with local Butch authorities as requested.

If these remnants include Selim Abu Domeik, the paramount sheikh of the Beni Atiya, or any other members of the tribe likely to be in particularly close touch witn Abdullah or especially hostile to Ibn Saud it would appear that special measures may be needed to restrict the activities of eucn persons.

They particularly appreciate the terms in which this readiness has been expressed. They suggest that the most appropriate procedure would be that the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia and the Chief Minister of the Transjordan Government should address notes to His Majesty^ Representative at Jedda and His Britannic Majesty*s High Commissioner for Transjordan respectively, requesting them to notify His Majesty*s Government of theor , receipt of confirmation from His Ljesty’s Government that a similar I 50 - u has been received from the other tide. If this procedure be accepted, His ijesty^s Government would propose to nunicate simultaneously to each of the ro Governments an authenticated copy of the ite received from the other. The date this communication would be fixed {forehand in agreement with them and the {cognition would tedce effect as from that ite. 2. His Britannic Majesty^ Government 'e received with equal satisfaction the isurance of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz that e is prepared to enter into treaty gotiations with the Government of Transjordan is soon as mutual recognition has taken Lace. With regard to the condition ittached to this assurance they desire to bate that, under Article 5 of the Agreement of ebruary 20th, 1928, between the United Kingdor and«,nd Transjordan, His Highness the .Amir undertook to be guided by the advice of His Britannic Majesty in all matters affecting the foreign relations of Transjordan, Having re gard to this article and their special position in regard to Transjordan, His Majesty's Government consider themselves responsible for ensuring the fulfilment by the Amir and his Government of international obligations contracted by them. They regard it as natural in the circumstances that they should tske part in the negotiations for a treaty settlement between oaudi Arabia and Transjordan and when that settlement is effected they will be prepared to take any necessary steps, in accordance with the principle laid down in the preceding sentence, to secure respect for its provisions on the part of Transjordan, 3. His Majesty's Government trust that the foregoing statement will dissipate any doubt which may exist in the mind if HisMajesty &amp;in&amp; Aodul Aziz regarding the future effect 0 f the settlement at which it is hoped to r arrive. They will be prepared, if necessary, to contirm the statement in an exchange of notes between the Government of Saudi Arabia and themselves simultaneously with the conclusion of the proposed agreement between the latter and the Government of Transjordan. They suggest that if His Majesty King Abdul Aziz and his Government are in agreement with their proposals, the question of mutual recognition should be disposed of forthwith on the lines indicated in paragraph one of this memorandum and that arrangements should then be made lith the least possible delay to proceed with the further negotiations.PARAPHRA^ fn&gt;in thti High Codcnise loner for Trans Jordan to the Secretary of State for the Ooioniee.

His Majesty's Government do not consider it practicable or expedient to request Ibn laud to give immediate orders for such internal measures as removal of raiders from the neighbourhood of the frontier in order to enable Trans-Jordan authorities to carry out a proposal originated by them and so far as Saudi Government know entirely for Trans-Jordan's own purposes. Moreover there appears to be some doubt whether Ibn 3aud would have sufficient control over raiders to enable him to give effect to the request. even if he were willing to do so. The alternative of seeking to obtain an undertaking from Ibn Gaud that no molestation of Beni Atiya would take nlace on crossing the frontier, with;- view to reassuring tribesmen, is open to strong objection. Tribesmen could not be induced to cross the frontier by an undertaking which was understood to imply freedom from molestation only in the immediate neighbourhood of the frontier. Any more complete assurance on Ibn ooud s part could not be. expected or if obtained might prove ineffectual m practice, and in the event of tribesmen being induced to cross the frontier on the strength of an assurance understood oy them to be more complete .and of their subsequently suffering severe - a. r f Government the. good faith of punishment at instance of ouuai uoveim „1.

BECHET 22nd October,1932 INTERIM HPPOHT . HEDJAZ REVOLT . (Origin and responsibility). 1* On 10th October H.H. the Amir Abdullah gave a dinner in King Faisal's honour at the summer camp in ADJLOUH. After the departure of the guests King Faisal, H.H. the Amir Abdullah and a certain Mohammed El Onsi (an Ex-Chamberlain) remained together in the tent. 2. The topic of conversation was the Ibn Hifada affair and the following extracts from it are considered worthy of notice. (a) King Faisal blamed the Amir for being hasty in ( his efforts to foster the revolt. Because of this (he said) several important men have been killed and a considerable financial loss has been incurred. (b) King Faisal said that half the blame should be attached to Hamd El^adia and Abdul Haouf Sabban because he was convinced that it was solely on their advice that the Amir had acted prematurely. (c) King Faisal said that the Amir Shaker had told him that he was against the Amir Abdullah's schemes fran the outset and had on that account declined to hold any communication with the Palace for a week; that although the quarrel was ultimately patched up he had carried out his instructions in connection with ohe revolt with the greatest misgiving. (d)(d) King Faisal told H.H. the Amir that he was convinced that the British authorities still suspect him (Abdullah) to be intriguing against Ibn Saoud. (e) Finally, the King rated the Amir in words to this effect T It was absolutely childish of you to encourage a mere 1,000 men, of whom only one third bore arms, to fight against Ibn Saoud. You should have talien my advice about it. You should first of all have made arrangements with the tribal Sheikhs on the 1 Iraq and Syrian frontiers to strike at Ibn Saoud simultaneously with Ibn Hifada. Ibn Saoud would then have been invaded on three sides and in all probability would have collapsed. Anyhow the time is coming. The Sheriflians must go back to their grandfathers 1 country''.

I have etc., (Sgd) M.A.Young, Acting High Commissioner for Transjordan His Majesty^ Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies. 28.10.32 29.10.32 To His Highness the Amir Abdullah From the British Resident,Amman,with enclosure. Copies of the above letters have also been sent To His Majesty’s Charge d»Affaires at Jeddah28th October,1932. Your Highness, As Your Highness has already been informed by the British Resident I have come to the conclusion after very careful consideration that it is contrary to the interests of public security in Trans.Jordan that certain members of the Beni Atiya tribe should escape further punishment for conduct which has caused grave difficulties in the past or that certain sections of the tribe should be allowed to remain during the coming winter in Trans-Jordan, as I understand they contemplate doing. After consultation with His Majesty* s Government I have decided that orders should be issued forthwith in the following sense by the Beduin Control Board and I rely upon Your Highness to see that these orders are promulgated forthwith, and that all necessary steps are taken to ensure that they are carried out. 3, These orders are as follows:- (l) The fine of 10 camels which Dalish ez-Zela, Mohamed Ibn Farhan.Mohamed Ibn Irsheid and Hammad Ibn Saleh have been ordered to pay shall be collected forthwith from the flocks of these men or those of their relatives up to the fifth degree* (2) All Beni Atiya raiders who set out during June last and who have not yet been tried will be tried at once in presence or absence and will be Highness Tlie Amir Abdullah.—be fined a minimum of 2 camels each.

All_Beni Atiya except such as have lived for the last five years uninterruptedly in Kerak or such others as obtain passes from Captain Glubb will be evacuated under the supervision of the Desert Patrol from Trans-Jordan into the Hejaz forthwith. The Officer Commanding Desert Patrol will fix a date by which all Beni Atiya,other than those exempted as above, must be South of the Trans- Jordan/ftejaz frontier. Any persons subject to this order who after that date and until further orders are found in Trans-Jordan shall be fined twenty pounds and undergo one year's imprisonment. I am etc., (Sgd) M. A. YoungSECRET REF. NO. 192/Sec. Your Excellency I have the honour to inform you that,having learnt on the evening of the 27th that the Secretary of State had given his approval to the proposals made in regard to the Beni Atiya, I called on the Amir on the morning of the 28th and, after informing him that His Excellency the High Commissioner was dissatisfied with the manner in which the Beni Atiya had been dealt with,told him that I was instructed to call upon him to cause the Bedu Control Board to issue the following orders and have them carried out:- (l) The fine of 10 camels, which Dalish Ez Zela, Mohamed Ibn J?irhan,Mahamed Ibn Irsheid and Hammad Ibn Saleh have been ordered to pay, shall be collected forthwith from the flocks of these men or those of their relatives up to the fifth degree. All Beni Atiya raiders who set out during June last and who have not yet been tried will be tried at once in presence or absence and will be fined a minimum of 2 camels each. ( 2 ) These His Excellency The Acting High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan Jerusalem*These animals to be collected before the tribe leaves Trans-Jordan from the flocks of the men sentenced or from those of their relatives up to the fifth degree. (3) All Beni Atiya will be evacuated from Trans-Jordan into the Hedjaz forthwith, except such as have lived for the last 5 years at least in Kerak uninterruptedly or such others as obtain passes from the Officer Commanding the Desert Patrol (Captain Glubb). ( 4 ) The move will take place under the super vision of the Desert Patrol. The Officer Commanding the Desert Patrol will fix a date by which all Beni Atiya (less those exempted under 3 above) must be South of the Trans-Jordan/iledjaz frontier. After this date and until further orders all Beni Atiya found in Trans-Jordan (except those exempted above) will be liable to arrest, confiscation of their flocks (to the maximum of £P20 per individual) and imprisonment not exceeding one year, ( 5 ) The Officer Commanding the Desert Patrol is empowered, at his discretion, to permit the entry into Trans-Jordan from the Hedjaz of bona fiae caravans coming to purchase food. His Highness was very much upset at this communication and said that he had done his best to conform to the policy of His Majesty's Government but that to ask him to drive out a tribe from hishis ountry into the arms of those (he said he meant Ibn Saoud's officials and not the King himself) who would kill them, men, women and children, was asking too much and that he would call his people together to-morrow amd after telling them the circumstances would leave them. I told His Highness that it was not intended to go to the length of shedding blood in forcing the ejection of the Beni Atiya selected, v/hereupon he said he was prepared to agree to points (l) and (2) and to a combination of (3) and (4), it being put to the tribesmen that they could have the choice of ejection or the payment of a fine and imprisonment. I them asked him if I was to understand that he refused to have the order for eviction carried out unconditionally,to this he replied that might no doubt was right and thank God the Mandatory Power had plenty of guns and soldiers and if the English drove the Beni Atiya out of the country the blame would not be his, for he had advised most strongly against it. I pointed out that this would not do, for what was required was that he should order his own forces to do the work by means of the Bedu Control Board whose order he must assent to himself to ma^ce it executory. His Highness then said hecould not take so momentous a decision on a verbal demand an^ must .iave it in writing. I then left His Hi^iness, the interview having lasted 55 minutes,and went by air to Jerusalem and, having discussed the matter with Your Excellency andand received a letter (a copy of which I attach) addressed by Your Excellency to His Highness, I was back in Amman at 5.0 p.m. I invited Jheikh Fuad to come to my house at 6.0 p.m. and, having been unable to get Your Excellency*s letter translated in time, went with bheikh Fuad to call on His Highness at 6.30 p.m. I found that His Highness had quite calmed down since the morning. He opened the conversation by saying that his resistance to the demands made was based on genuine conviction and on the desire that His Majesty*s Government should not act unwisely. The letter was then carefully explained to him by Sheikh Fuad and the Amir remarked that the conditions were practically the same as those given to him in the morning except that the penalty had been put at the maximum of £P.20 and one year instead of being left indefinite as before. He asked what was required of him, and on being told said he would pass the orders to the Bedu Control Board with instructions that they are to be carried out. His Highness then expressed amazement at the severity of the demand and asked me what had occasioned it • I gave him some of the reasons and he will, no doubt, hear the remainder from Sheikh Fuad to whom I had spoken quite openly. I then promised to let His Highness have the translation of Your Excellency*s letter in Arabic next morning and took my leave. This morning I sent the translation to His Highness at 8.20 by the hand of my Interpreter, butthe Amir rang me up andsaid he had expected to see me and would be glad if I would come along. I found His Highness very friendly; he said he had a surprise for me and produced the draft of a telegram, a translation of which I attach. He said his intention in suggesting the despatch of such a telegram was to show Your Excellency and myself his very real desire to conform to the policy of His Majesty*s Government and that if Your Excellency thought it best that the telegram should not go, he was quite ready to agree. The words shown in brackets were in the original draft but were replaced, at my suggestion, by those underlined. His Highness then asked me if any ulterior motive was attributed to his forthcoming journey eastwards into the desert, for if it were he would at once abandon all idea of the trip. I told him that some report had been made that he was going specially to see the Ruallah but that I had told Your Excellency I did not attach importance to it. He then said he would rather go to Ard es-Suwan (which lies between Bair and Amari) but had been shy of it, since it was towards the Hejd frontier. I said I thought this was unobjectionable provided he kept well away from the frontier and I expect that he will either go there or only as far as Azraq and that the duration of his absence will b e considerably curtailed. Captain Glubb leaves for Kerak this evening to see about the initial steps of the move of the Beni Atiya. In conclusion, I would bring to Your Excellency*s notice the very considerable help which Sheikh Euad has given in dealing with the Amir in this, as in many other, cases. I have, etc., (3gd.) C.H.E. Cox. BRITISH RESIDENTCOPY TRAHSLATIQff. DRAFT TELEGRAH. His Majesty King Abdul Aziz A1 Saoud. Out of regard for public security and in the interest of peace on the frontiers, we have decided to issue our orders that Beni Atiya should depart to your illustrious Kingdom after the trial and punishment of the culprits amongst them. I hope that these persons will obtain your magnanimous pardon and forgiveness in response to our request and intention to cooperate in the maintenance of peace and order in our respective countries, (and the respect of your legitimate rights, trusting that this hope would be favourably met).Decypher.

Con tinued presence of ^hhwan in northern Hejaz is news to me. If you verify it and still judge best that move should continue even if somewhat delayed en route I propose to take preliminary steps of informing Saudi government categorically that until they can assure me that Akhwan are sent home and that Beni Atiya will meet with and if necessary be controlled by ordinary peace time police measures only, move cannot possibly proceed.

Addressed t&lt;o Jeddah No.165 repeated to Secretary of State for the Colonies No.155. #ith reference to my telegram No.163 Beni Atiy the following further particulars now available. Attack was mad at Haj on November the lOth. Attackers were 50 camel men who we: probably not Akfcwan but Shararat. The Beni Atiy a party was composed of 5 men and 1 woman with 3 tents 0 All of their belongings were looted. They were not injured but are held prisoners. 9 pilgrims who were encamped with them were also attacked and robbed at the same time. It is possible that the attackers are a raiding party who have had permission to attack those Beni Atiya raiders who have remained (?) Hejaz since revolt but this is only conjecture. Of the Beni Atiya who are being moved from Transjordan, the landing portion with 30 tents are in district So wan a which is 50 miles North*’West of Mu daw ar a. They are disinclined to go forward for fear of similar treatment to th/ experienced by the party mentioned above. It is expected that all of the Beni Atiya who are being moved will be concentrated at Sowana by next Tuesday. I suggest that if agreed,to by Hie Majesty’s Gov eminent, a communication to Saudi Government should I made as early as possible on the following lines begins, (a) Concentration and southward movement of Beni Atiya numbering about 200 tents now taking place. (b) They are expected to be all in the neighbourhood of Sowana by November the a 5th. (c) Move is however being obstructed by information receive of action taken by raiders against a small party which crossed at MudawaraMudawara iridepeiuiently and in advance of oi^anised movement on November the 10th. Details of attack as above. id) Request that immediate orders may be given for removal ox these raiders i rom the neighbourhood of the frontier in order . . asove into Sardi Arabia may proceed and particularly request that Beni Atiya may not be molested on croeeing the frontier. ‘® ^ time I would recommend that Amir's amended message should be delivered. Ends. 1 should be glad if you would await the approval of His Majesty * a Government before delivering any part of the above message particularly (a) since the actual crossing of tribesmen is now probably dependent on steps taken to remove their fears and cannot thereforo be stated to be reasonably certain - see Secretary of State 9 s telegram to you Mo. 139.
