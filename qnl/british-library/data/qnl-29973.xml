Bagdad, July 24, 1934. Enclosure in No. 1. Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs. (No. 409. Confidential.) 7 7 r , aa My dear Minister, Bagdad, July 24, 1934. IN a confidential letter No. 873/C, which he was so good as to address to me on the 7th June last, your predecessor enclosed a copy of a communication from the Turkish Ministry for Foreign Affairs to the Royal Iraqi Legation m Angora, in which they put forward the view that the minutes of the luico-Peisian Frontier Demarcation Commission of 1914 had no official nature owing to the interruption of the commission’s work by the war. 2. In my reply, I informed Dr. Damluji that I was drawing the attention of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to the attitude of the Turkish Government in this matter. I am now in possession of the views of His Majesty’s Government. . . , . 3. His Majesty’s Government consider that the view put forward by the Turkish Ministry for Foreign Affairs is untenable. Article V of the protocol signed on behalf of the British, Turkish, Russian and Persian Governments on the 17th November, 1913, stipulated that as soon as any part of the frontier should have been delimited, that part should be considered as definitely fixed and should not be liable to further examination or alteration. The minutes of the Frontier Delimitation Commission show that delimitation and demarcation were completed on the 26th October, 1914, from Fao to Ararat with the exception of the Kotur district, which is on the present Turco-Persian frontier. Further discussion regarding the frontier in this district was prevented by the outbreak of the war, but &amp; all four commissioners signed a detailed description of the rest of the frontier. . . 4. Your Excellency will observe from the above that the delimitation ot that part of the Turco-Persian frontier which now forms the frontier between Iraq and Persia was completed before the work of the commission was interrupted. In the view of His M^ajesty s Government, that part of the fiontiei accoidmgly became definitive and binding under article V of the protocol referred to above. Yours, &amp;c. G.

In accordance with the delimitation arrangement made with the Turkish Government on the 23rd January 1932, for the assigning of a Commission for the purpose, the Imperial Persian Government have appointed on their behalf His Excellency Mozaffar Khan Aalam (Sardar Intisar) as the Head of the Commission, Lieutenant Colonel Ahmad Mirza Khusrovani, the Engineer Mirza Abdul Razagh Khan and Lieutenant Colonel Mofakhami as the members of the Commission, accompanied by a technical Body. The Turkish Government have on the other hand appointed Colonel Seif-il-Din Bey, as the Head, and Captain Najm-il-Din Bey, Said Bey and Colonel Ebrahim Edham Bey as their members of the Commission. The two missions will meet at Kelissa Kandi, a district of Avagiq on the first June 1934 (llth Khordad 1313) where they will hold their sessions. As it has been decided that the delimitation Commission should this year fix the places where the marks should be put up, and that another Body (composed of certain members of the two Commissions) should attend to tne construction of these marks, it is hoped that the delimitation work will be completed tnis year.Copy, r,Q£)'j :*wsicw omcs, s.*.a.

Upon the Legation’s asking the Turkish Foreign Ministry for copies of the said minutes, the latter replied that owing to the declaration of general mobilisation in 1914 the minutes in question had acquired no official nature. In Tiew of the importance of this declaration, owing to the bearing it has on the frontier line determined in 1914, I thought it desirable to forward to you, for information, a copy of the Turkish Foreign Ministry 5 s letter in Turkish, together with an English translation thereof.

Sir, I have reported In my telegram Kob. 24 and 28 of tie 17th February, that at the meeting which I had vith the Minister of Court and the ! iniater ior Foreign ffaiie yesterday to discuss the proposed nglo^ersian Treaty, Teymourtacfte, speaking as if it were an idea which had just come into Lis head and pretending that he had not even mentioned it to Feroughi, asked whether it would not be possible to induce His Majesty’s oovernment to renounce t ie idea of a lease of Benjam. v e proceeded to explain that it would be extremely difficult to justify in the Chamber (which, I take it, may be considered as an alias for tne Shah and his military advisers) a lease of henjam coupled with thk; prolongation of Imperial Airways permit to use tue : ersian coast. In the eyes of these critics Britain would then have an actual naval base at tnc most strategic point in the Gulf and potential air bases strewn along the ersian coast. indeed, in their eyes the position of Persia would be no better than that of ’Xi'aq from t^e point of view of sovereignty and independence. For hiiaself he in no way agreed that the use of ’ersian aero dromes by Imperial Airways was objectionable from any point of view, though he fully snared the dislike for the hen jam lease, but apart from, and above all this, the renunciation of The fight Honourable fir John Simon, G.C.B.I., etc., etc., etc.. The Foreign Office.of our cleim to a leee© would produce a tremendous effect on public opinion In rerala. Purely we could find some other suitable place in the aulf and he would have thought that, now our political interests in the Gulf were moving northwards, Bahrein would be eminently suitable* (X do not fcrnow from where he derived this idea)* 8* I t old His Highness that X could not remember from my perusal of tae recorde at the Legation that he had raised the Question of Henjam before* It seemed to me to be extraordinarily late in the day to do so, and ae for Imperial irways it seemed to me absurd to talk about potential air bases when it must be well-known that our military aeroplane© always used the Southern side of the rulf and had their depots there* I went on to say that I regarded it as quite inevitable that His Majesty’s Govern ment would take this proposal of his in very bad pert, to which his highness blandly replied that it depended on ay presentation of the case. I signified ay dissent. 3. It is quite likely that I Imagined it, but I had an impression that Teymourtache laid some stress on the word 'lease'; I decided, however, that X would not pursue the topic until I had had time to think the matter over, and I contented myself with making it abundantly clear that his Majesty’s Government would be very much taken back* 4. It ie tlierefore just possible thatTeymourtache would accept some such gentleman’s agreement as I have sketched in the concluding passages of my despatch No. 76 of February 13th, but I doubt it. He knows What importance we attach to Imperial Airways and he also knows the weakness ofof our position at Kenjam and in these two factors he quite rightly sees all the elements of a diplomatic triumph* h. At the same time I believe that to-doy hia inclination ia definitely in favour of e settlement end that he would to-day be genuinely disappointed if he iailed to achieve one. It requires, however, but a cursory acquaint ance with tiie recent archives of this Legation to realite how quickly hie moods can change and therefore I do not believe taat we can safely bank on hia present predilections. If we could I should be inclined to say to him that we hold him to the lease of henjam to which he agreed in principle long ago and that so far as imperial Airways are concerned the threat to deny them the use of far the most convenient and safe xoute to India is so obviously unfriendly that the continuance of negotiations for a treaty of friendship would be a pure farce under the shadow of that threat. 6. If we adopted this heroic line and Teymourtache (and possibly the Shah too) remained unmoved it would mean a consider able dislocation to Imperial Airways’ service and also render our tenure of hen^a® definitely more precar ious than it has been recently. The alternative is, of course, one of tne gracefxxl concessions of which those who iiave been intimately connected with these long drawn negotiations must be heartily tired. 7. The best I can make of it is something on these lines Simultaneously with the signature of the Treaty an excuan&amp;e of notes would be published in which the Persian Government would intimate tneir reluctance tust we should remain at henjam owing to the anchorage being required for the Persian Navy. Tuere would be a reply to the efiectthat hie Mftjesty'a Government fully epprecieted the eituation but they very much hoped that time could be allowed for the British quadron in the dulf to make other arrangements. This would be granted in the most satisfactory and complimentary terms it proved possible to extract. There would then be a feint hope that the Persian Government would tacitly acquiesce in our sharing hen^ara with their Navy. 8. it may be credulous but I believe that Teymourtache is largely sincere when he maintains, as he is vehemently doint at present, that his insistence on comparatively unimportant points of principle'is not due to ill-will but ie © natural and fairly reasonable consequence of the recent history of Persia. ' o far as henjam is concerned I should oe inclined to say that, once the British Squadron in the Gulf ceased to be obviously and undeniably based on that ort j&gt; e might not object to their enjoying during the summer montiiB the amenities which its relatively tolerable climate provides. t. '• ith this in mind, I asserted very categorically in tne course of the meeting which we had yesterday tnat from t-ie climatic and recreational point of view henjam was the only tolerable spot in the summer. Teymourtache said that there was surely no great difference between henjam end Bahrein, so I suggested that he should satisfy himself on the point by spending a summer in the Gulf. he then mention ed Basrah as a possibility: Basrah, I assured him, was in the summer a veritable hell. In the end I ; ot from him something approaching an edmiaeion that it might possibly be necessary to reconsider his views if it really were the case tsat the surrender of Benjam would render conditions inin the Gulf intolerable for his Majesty's ahipa, which was certainly not his wish. In the feint hope that this line may be worth following up I am asking the political Resident (see my telegram No. 29 of the 20th February) for precise information on climatic conditions. 10. In order to avoid the risk of subsequent misunder- standing, I should state, in parenthesis, that I throughout urged the climatic, rather than the positional, veue of i anjam. T-e latter, I maintained, was a minor factor, henjam; The word 'strategic” cannot obviously be allowed into the discussion with the Persians, and I cannot help thinking tiiat it should definitely be left out of our calculations. in the event of another greet war ersia will at its outbreak, be (a) an ally, (b) a neutral whose neutrality is promptly violated by our enemies as in 1914, (c) en enemy, (d) a neutral, whose neutrality we hope to see respected by our enemies. in the first three cases, henjam would be readily available as a base, even though not in our occupation at the time; in the last case, if we were in occupation of Henjam at the outbreak of war, its prompt evacuation would offer the best hope of a general respect for Persia's neutrality. 11. ] rom Ken jam we turned to Bahrein and Teyinourtache advanced the view, as an introduction to the discussion, that Persia was entitled to reject all the findings of the Turoc-Persian frontier Commission because it had not finished its work when the war intervened, the xesult being that Persia never received in the Northern Sections the compen sations sne was entitled to expect for unfavourable decisions in tue South. Thether his view (which I had, of •ourse, contested)contested) % as sound or not, the ere lan Government proposed to ask , Iraq for a frontier ratification in the neighbourhood of Khanikln where, for no apparent reason, the Commission had to Persia’s detriment departed from the line which it had laid down along the crest of the mountains. ! uoh a rectifi cation would perhaps be a suitable set-off for Persian claims to Bahrein. I told His Highness that this was the first time I had heard of a ersien demand for a frontier rectifi cation near Khanikin. 1 h ve since looked up the Constant inople rotocol of November 4th, 1913 and find that rticle 6 which I shall take an early opportunity of re*ding to Teymour- tache, shows t^at his tresis is untenable. 12. This excursion into Iraq naturally brought the conversation back to Tamb and in the course of it His Highness said half jokingly that it vas an admirable plan to bind these Arab Sheikhs not to alienate their territories and then to constitute ourselves the judge of any disputesregarding the extent of them. But disputes must be settled if not by negotiation, which I appeared to reject, then by some outside authority. I did not reply and a slightly gloomy silence followed which I broke by remarking lightlyi 'in fact, Your 'H ighness, the only advance you have made since the negotiations 'were suspended is the suggestion just put forward that we 'shall voluntarily withdraw our request for a lease of Henjam'. Teymourtache replied swiftly t .at in return for J enjem he was offering us a prolongation of tue Gulf route for Imperial Airways* That he said, was a definite concession seeing how definitely it had been stipulated that the Gulf route would in no case be available after three yeas. I replied that I had never understood why tne Company had not insisted that there shouldshould be a saving clause to provide that the matter would be ie-exejoined if the internal route proved impossible as it had been proved to be* Teymourtac^e , s xeply indicated that he would not hove agreed to anything of the sort, as he wished the International lines using Persian facilities to be of benefit to Persia, if he had agreed to it Imperial irways would have simply established the fact that the inland route was impossible for the type of machines that they chose to use and his hope of compelling tha air lines to go through Tarsia would have been doomed for every. Junhers were flying successfully along routes similar to those that imperial .Airways would not look at which showed how right he was. I said that Junkers were working an internal service, which was quite another matter. For thirteen consecutive days this winter no aeroplane, as I had recently observed to peroughi, had been able to leave Tehran. Was it likely that anybody would attempt to fly from London to India with the possibility of being held up by weather conditions for days on end. Teymourtache could not think of any effective reply, and I went on to say that there was nothing to prevent him from having an internal service working in conjunction with the Trunk lines. pad Junkers not been staying on, for the time being, I should already have made tentative suggestions on tills subject to the Persian Oovernment. when all was said ana done hie attitude was no more reasonable than would have been that of the wise Government when the main rail way lines were built, had it refused a passage through Switzerland unless the lines passed through Berne. To refuse to allow airlines to use the obvious and safe routewould be inciefenBible. I then eeked whet he would say If I received instructions to tell him thet his proposal regard ing /irways and henjam uad not only made a most disagree able impression but also suggested to Kis Majesty’s Government the suspicion that he had deliberately toyed with the negotiations in order to defer matters until the air issue was ripe for hie purpose* Teymourtache was delighted and said that the manoeuvre had net occurred to him, if it had he would have patted himself on the back and very possible have used it. Ke believed in cynicism just as he believed in frankness; cynicism was the only safe guide in the conduct of public affairs. I retorted that I regretted that he had not spent his time to better purpose in England. 15. I have reported these essentially uninteresting ©xcuan^es in considerable detail, because tuey may serve as a guide and, if not, as a warning in the conduct of future discussions with Teymourteche or his mental and spiritual successor. I, rather than Teymourteohe, have been respons ible for the flippant seriousness of our discussions wherever agreement *as not readily attainable. I have not the faintest idea whether I am making any progress towards an agreement. It ie probably too soon to judge. The only favourable indications are that he has been eminently good- huraoured throughout, tjjat he has been anxious to hold fre quent meetings and that over unimportant points he has shown an accommodating spirit. On these points I am reporting separately. 14. I h? ve agreed to a further meeting on Monday the 22nd when we shall run through the rest of the draft treaty. fter that, we will not meet foi some little time in order to digest our discussions and to enable me to receive youryour imstruc t/icna. lij • a minor point is worth mentioning* at our meeting on February 12th Toymourtaohe attid in a gently gru hling tone that as regards the dushire osidenoy we were alreaay a year bohindhund* Not being definitely sure cf the precise nature of our undertaking to transfer it elsewhere, I said nothing but reverted to the question at our last masting and said that there h^d never been any doubt in our mind that the transfer of th*' Kesidency waa part and parcel of the general settlement. Teymourtsohe said* uite cheerfully that perhaps he had misunderstood* 16. The points with regard to which I trust that it will be possible to give me early infer, ation are: 1) whether there is any possibility of a frontier rectification in Baluchistan; 8) Tc what extent I may seek for a compromise on t e subject of Hanjam, involving the establishment of our base elsewhere; 3) Whether the reservation of Bahrein on the lines suggested in my telegram No.11 of the 12th i'ebruar can be put forward in last report; 4) The relative Value attached to Henjam ana Imperial Airways, that is, supposing I have tried 2) ana f^ilea, should I coacentrate on a satisfactory lease of Hen jam with a olaar understandi ig in my- own mind that there is to be no bargaining of enjar for Imperial .4rway8? 17.

During his stay he will be the guest of the Turkish Government, and will assist at the ceremonies given in connexion with the anniversary of the proclamation of the Turkish Republic. 2. Feroughi Khan is accompanied by Abbas Dull Khan Oarib, *iuaa Khan Isfendiyari, Hasan Khan Kayat, ex-Under-secretary of State at the Persian Ministry of Economy, Gulam Risa Khan, head of the Eastern Department of the Persian Ministry fpr Foreign Affairs, and Colonels aftihsln Khan and Atehmet Khan Diba. 3. At Constantinople Feroughi Khan informed the representative of the 'Hakimiyeti Milliye' that the purpose of his visit to Turkey was to return the visit paid to Tehran in January of thia year by Tevfik RfiftCl Bey. He added that all questions of «$ajor importance between the two countries had been settled. Conversations would take place about economic matters and about a projected commercial treaty. He also hoped to renew a treaty ... Right Honourable, Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., K.C.V.O., etc., etc., etc..treaty of neutrality, non-aggression, and collaboration. Falih Rifki Bey, In a leader In the 'Hakiraiyetl tfilliye* welcoming Feroughi Khan, attributes the improvement in the relations between Turkey and Persia to the establishment of a new regime in each country. Republican Turkey adopted the policy of peace and friendship with neighbouring States and Feroughi Khan, who as Ambassador at Angora had been able to convince himself of the sincerity of Turkey’s policy, had played his part in explaining Turkey’s alms to his Shah and in bringing the countries together. 4. It ia an interesting commentary on Persian mentality,as revealed by Mr. Hoare's despatches, to note that, in the course of an interview given to the w R6publique n by Feroughi Khan , at which the Persian Ambassador was present, the latter interrupted an historical retrospect of the quarrels between the two countries, alleged to be due to the sinister influence exercised by Sultans and Shahs, to call all to witness that foreign countries especially had profited by these quarrels, and to declare that in future the friendship existing between the two sister nations, each of which had won its national independence, would be proof against every external assault. 5. At a banquet given in honour of Feroughi Khan on the 27th October, cordial speeches were made by him and by Tevfik Rfiftli Rey, attributing Turoo-Perslan friendship to the bonds of mutual interest and to the efforts of the rulers of the countries who brought about the Treaty of HeutralityNeutrality and Friendship of the 22nd April* 1926* which opened a new era in Turoo-Peraian relations fruitful in agreements and understandings. 6.

Esq.2 f Northern Zone, is the most important strategically, as it gives to Turkey the control of the whole of the Lesser Ararat, a cession which will, it is hoped, enable her to deal more effectively with the Kurdish tribes of the neighbourhood. Turkey has, however, been in actual occupation of this area for a considerable time. 8 . The second deviation is the neighbourhood of Kotour. In this, Middle Zone, the line has again been pushed eastwards between Guirberan and^ Kuch Dagh so as to leave an area of some 90 square miles to Turkey. In spite of appearances, the settlement of the frontier in this neighbourhood is supposed to represent a concession to Persia, the Turkish (Government taking the line that they have never recognised the right of Persia to hold territory as far westwards as the new frontier. &gt; __ 1 9 . The third or Southern Zone presented the most difficulty, and the new alignment was only adopted owing to the personal intervention of Tevfik Ru§tii Bey. Even so, the Persian Government gained far less than they had hoped. In this zone the line of the frontier is pushed westwards between Bajirga and Kuner Kota Dagh so as to give Persia an area of some 80 square miles. The zone is of little value, but it has at least some inhabitants (all Turks, or at any rate non- Persians), while the other two zones are practically uninhabited. 10 . Upon the whole, Turkey appears to have come best out of the exchange of territory. 11 . The Turkish Embassy state that Pillars I to IX were placed in position in 1914, when the line that they mark was the frontier between Persia and Russia. I have not been able’ to find any correspondence bearing on this demarcation. The demarcation commission is expected to begin work this month, according to His Majesty’s consul at Tabriz (see my despatch No. 165 of the 5th April). 12.

Zia added that the population along the Little Ararat section was pronouncedly anti-Turkish* 6 .

''I ^Tehran, Janiuinj ' 27 , WITH reference to Mr. Morgan’s despatch No. 43i&gt; of the 23rd December, last, I liave the honour to report that Tevfik RUstti Bey, lurkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, accompanied by the I urkish Ambassador and the following staff:— His Excellency Djelal Bey (Deputy for Smyrna and Director-General of the “ Banque d’Affaires ” ; former Minister), Hussein Vasfi Bey (Director-General in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs), Colonel Chiikru Ali Bey (General Staff), Idris Tchora Bey (secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs; former consul), Osman Nuri Bey (secretary in the “ Banque d Affaires ), arrived at Pahlavi on the 17th January and reached the capital on the 18th January by road, the Persian authorities having performed a really remarkable piece of work in clearing of a heavy snow-fall the difficult passes between here and the Caspian. I hree days (one of them an eighteen-hour daj) of intensive work followed, as Tevfik Riistii Bey wished to leave for Bagdad on the 25th January, and by the 24th January it was possible to issue a communique, of which a copy is enclosed, stating that agreement had been reached on the subject of the frontier in the neighbourhood of Little Ararat, and that it had been decided to conclude a treaty of arbitration and to initiate discussions for the conclusion of establishment, commercial and extradition conventions, as well as for the development of economic relations. 2. From both Tevfik Riistii Bey (who greeted me as a long-lost twin) and Feroughi I have formed the definite impression that the visit is regarded as a o-reat success, having cleared away an atmosphere of suspicion which was a stubborn relic of the past more than anything else. Tevfik Riistti Bey declared that the Persians were genuinely surprised at the goodwill and desire for compromise which he had shown, but which had from the time of the Mosul negotiations been the keynote of Turkey’s foreign policy; as I knew well, his oeneral line of conduct, which had received the steady support of the Ghazi, was that even an indifferently satisfactory settlement was infinitely preferable to no settlement at all. He hoped and belie'ved that he had taught the Persians a lesson in the art of compromise which would be useful in promoting a settlement of the outstanding issues between Persia and His Majesty s Government His Excellency further told me that nothing could have been more cordial than the Shah’s manner to him. His Majesty clearly had a sound grasp of the main political issues which confronted his country. T ,.. . i 3. At one of the parties given in his honour, l evfik Rustu told me that he had just received a piece of news which delighted him, as he felt sure it would me, namely, that you hoped to pay a visit to Angora in the course of the month of May. Having shared his delight, I said something—jokingly—about this being a counterblast to the Litvinov visit, which led him to affirm that there was no danger of any misunderstanding with Moscow; in fact, so far as Turkish policy was concerned, he was perfectly sure that both in London and in Moscow everybody slept soundly in their beds (“ dormaient sur les deux oreil es ). 1 replied that I was sure that they did in London, but was his Excellency absolutely convinced that they did in Moscow? The answer was ’’yes but with the qualification that Moscow was perhaps hyper-sensitive and inclined to be suspicious; all was well, however, provided that care was taken to strangle suspicions even before they saw the light of day. . , , , 4 Tevfik Riistii Bey had intended to return by air via Bagdad, but weather conditions have been hopeless, and he will now leave for Pahlavi and Moscow on [389 q—2]In any further comn^nicfttiqn on tmissubi^bt* please quote ^ NoTwtirw^ and address —not to any ptrsin by nanu, but to— “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.

WITH reference to Mr. Morgan’s despatch No. 436 of the 23rd December last, I have the honour to report that, when 1 called upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning on my return from leave, his Excellency, who is here for two or three days waiting for the steamei* that is to take him to Batum, began our conversation by telling me why he was going to Persia, and why he was going at this rather uncomfortable season of the year. 2. He was going now simply because, if he did not do so, he would, what with the Disarmament Conference and the visits he had to make to Moscow and Rome, be unable to go until late in the summer, whereas it was eminently desirable to settle up with the Persians as soon as possible. 3. As to why he was going at all, it was nominally, but also quite truthfully, in order to reach a definite settlement of the frontier question. He had told me in November, just before I went on leave, that he would go to Tehran if by so doing he could bring these protracted frontier negotiations to an end, and since then it had become quite clear to him that this was the only way to bring this about. The representatives of both countries, who had been conducting the actual negotiations, had reached agreement upon the really essential points, but they were haggling over other claims and counter-claims that did not really matter and were getting lost in the thicket of rather futile and unnecessary discussions which threatened, unless brought to an abrupt end, to envenom and upset the whole thing. Ismet Pasha had, therefore, entirely agreed with the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the only thing to do was for his Excellency to go to Tehran and settle the question on broad lines over the heads of the subordinate negotiators. 4. Obviously, it was not impossible to do this without undergoing the dis comforts of a winter journey to Persia, though the fact that the Persians would be flattered by the visit would, no doubt, contribute to make the final negotiations easier, but Ismet Pasha and Dr. Tevfik Rii^tii were taking advantage of this excellent pretext in order that the latter might gauge for hinnelf the real feeling in Tehran towards Turkey. His Excellency said that for some time he had noticed a certain reserve, or rather nervousness, in the Persian attitude towards Turkey, a nervousness which could not be entirely attributed to the rather small difficulties of the frontier negotiations, and the Turkish Government wanted to get to the bottom of tins feeling and either dissipate it or adjust their policy accordingly. If it was found that Persia's uneasiness simply arose from failure to grasp the sincerity of Turkish policy, the Turkish Government felt that the best way to set the Persian minds at ease was by personal contact between the Turkish Foreign Minister and His Majesty the Shah and his responsible advisers, including particularly Teymourtache. The Turkish Government wanted Persia to under stand that Turkey's desire for friendship was loyal and sincere, but if Teyfik Ru§tii Bey found that the Persians failed to respond to the spirit of his visit, then Turkey would draw the natural inference and take all necessary precau tions against what the Minister for Foreign Affairs called “ a Persian stab in the back.” 5. His Excellency said that it was only to me that he had given these explanations, because he realised how closely interested we were in Persia, and he wished us to know exactly the motives for his visit. 6. I should add that Tevfik Rti§tu Bey proposes to proceed from Tehran to Bagdad to visit King Feisal and, presumably, put the finishing touches to the discussions which Nuri Pasha has been having with his Excellency in Angora. 7. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran. I have, Ac. GEORGE R. CLERK. [362 o—l]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT /'•s PERSIA.

THE Turkish Ambassador told me to-day that the Turkish Foreign Minister was on his way to Tehran in order to carry through a negotiation for a small modification of the line of the Turco-Persian frontier. He explained that at present the line runs through Mount Ararat, and that parties of brigands on the Turkish side, when pursued, escaped over the boundary, and vice versa. Consequently, it is proposed that the whole of the mountain should be thrown within Turkish territory, and that Persia should receive by way of compensation a piece of territory further south which is now on the Turkish side of the line. The scheme for this exchange had already been under discussion, and the Foreign Minister’s journey was for the purpose of carrying it through. Ferit Bey added that on his return journey the Turkish Foreign Minister might arrange to pass through Bagdad, but, if he did so, the visit would be for the purpose of establishing personal contact with the Iraqi Government and had no special object.

Lt.-Colonel, Military Attache. His Majesty’s Minister Tehran.Information obtained from Major Nishet, Turkish —Attach^• 1. The Turkish Ambassador, H«JC*Ridvahbey Oglu Husrev Bey, has recently left for Ankara on leave. His wife and family are not well and he may he away two or three months or on the other hand he may not return at all. He told the Minister of Foreign Affairs that he was going to discuss the frontier question and other matters with his Government and also that he thought that he was too good for Tehran where there was not sufficient scope for his ability. M. Djevad Bey, Counsellor of the Embassy, has also left Tehran en route Moscow. His successor, who is at present in Ankara, has recently been in London. 2. Major Nishet stated that there was no Persian Military Attache in Turkey. I reported, some months ago, that Colonel Ansari had been appointed as M.A.Ankara but he appears to have been since recalled. 3. The Frontier Commissioner, Colonel Kazem Khan, Sayah, has been recalled to Tehran, where he now is, and his successor is Colonel Mohteshemi, brother of the G.O.C. N.W.Division, Tabriz. 4. Reference attached map. The Perso-Turkish frontier question is now settled except for one hill which the Persians are determined to retain and the Turks have already occupied. The Hill is marked x on attached sketch. The Persian military authorities consider that this hill commands the important Maku area and the Turks require it to protect the road which runs south from Hassanaga to Bulak Bashi, which road is the proposed frontier line, the road itself to be Turkish territory. The amount of territory to be ceded to Persia&lt;g? Persia further to the south, and that portion in the Ararat area to he given'to Turkey, has been agreed to, only the hill mentioned above is now in dispute. 5. It appears that, as a result of the Shah’s recent tour in the N.W. frontier area, a new division is to be formed with headquarters at Urmmiah, separate from, and independent to, the present N.W. Division, which has headquarters at Tabriz. A special grant of half a million tomans has been alloted to establish this new division. Sartip Muhammed Khan, Shahbakhti is to be in command. The Turkish M.A. considers that this new formation is in the nature of a threat to Turkey but he agreed that the situation ■yyj_th regard to the Persian Kurds in the N.vV. frontier area might be a contributory reason. Major Nishet stated that relations between the Turks and the Persians showed no signs of improvement and, especially since the recent manoeuvres ox the Central Garrison (Tehran), there was a good deal of wild talk and rumours of a coming war between the two countries next spring.

WITH reference to Sir Robert Clive's despatch No. 286 of the 3rd June, enclosing a copy of Tabriz telegram No. 16 of that date on the subject of the Kurdish campaign in the Ararat zone and its effect on the Perso-1 urkish frontier area, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy in translation of a leading article in the “ Iran, purporting to record the substance of an interview with the principal Persian officer on the Perso-1 urkish Frontier Security Commission^ 1 ) 2. As you are aware, it is the policy of the Persian Government to suppress all reference in the Persian press to the incidents on that uncomfortable border, save an occasional pronouncement to the effect that, contrary to all reports in the foreign press, the situation leaves nothing to be desired. The present article is just such a pronouncement, and there is no real reason to suppose that Colonel Kazem Khan’s statements coincide at any point with the true facts of the case, unless it be in their revelation of the entire lack of co-operation between the Persian and Turkish forces. Since, however, the Iran is of a semi-official character, and this article bears clear indications of official inspiration (it is safe to say that no Persian officer would dare to state his views on any subject without definite instructions), the article has, perhaps, a certain vicarious interest. 3 . The Ararat zone is almost inaccessible to travellers, and the truth about frontier disputes and incidents is particularly hard to come by. In striking contrast to this inspired statement are the two despatches and the extract from Tabriz which I enclose herewith.(') His Majesty 's consul in that town is separated from the scene of operations by a considerable area, and 1 am prepared to believe that there is a large element of exaggeration in the rumours which have reached him. You will observe that, according to one of these, the Persians recently suffered no less than 800 casualties. At the same time there can be no doubt but that Mr. Palmer’s reports come much nearer the truth than the official version. The latter, indeed, merely illustrates by an indirect process the complete apathy of Persian public opinion and the extent to which it can be led in blinkers. 4 . I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq, and to His Majesty’s representatives at Constantinople and Tabriz.

WITH reference to Mr. Morgan’s despatch No. 118 of the 8 th April last, I have the honour to report that in a recent conversation with a member of my staff the Persian Ambassador stated that he expected that the negotiations for a readjustment of the Turco-Persian frontier would shortly be actively resumed in Tehran and brought to a successful conclusion. 2 . The parties were now in agreement that the compensatory cession of Turkish territory would be effected in two places, near Kotur and near Bazirgan, which seems to be where the Maku-Bayazit road crosses the frontier. It only remained to settle the extent of the cessions at each point, both at those mentioned above and on Ararat. All the Turks really needed in the latter area was sufficient territory to give them a practicable road round the mountain on what was at present Persian soil, but they were holding out for more. The cession which they were demanding was of a strategic nature, whilst, in return, they were offering- territory of no particular value. 3. His Excellency added that he did not anticipate any trouble with the Kurds this year. The co-operation between the three Governments concerned, which had now been instituted, made all the difference. The surrender of Sheik Mahmud had been very important. Last year the Turks had let themselves be caught napping, but now they were wide awake. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, and His Majesty’s High Commissioner in Iraq. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE R. CLERK. [181 y 1 ]i 13 ON THE SLOPES OF ARARAT -T' 2 3-MA^J33l AN ARMENIAN ADVENTURE FORBIDDEN LANDS From a Correspondent It 1ms again been reported that the Turkish Government is to construct a road in the Ararat region to facilitate transport between Irebizond and North-Western Persia. This decision, if it is serious, will have the most far-reaching con sequences upon the future of Persian economic life. At present the only road for European goods is through Russian territory, and, though certain through-traffic rights between Batum and Julfa are guaranteed to the signatories of the Soviet trade treaty, it is clear that Russia will not allow free passage to goods likely to compete with her own produce. This is nothing short of a stranglehold upon the Persian con sumer. At present the only alternatives to the Russian route for goods consigned from Europe to Northern Persia are the immense detours in volved by the overland desert route between Haifa or Beirut to Baghdad and Khanikin, and the Suez Oanal-Persian Gulf route which connects with Teheran and the north by the two trans-Persian highways, Mohammerah- Khurramabad-Teheran and Bushire-Ispahan- Teheran. A shorter alternative to the overland desert route will be available when the Iraq Govern ment has completed the small section of road between Rowanduz and the Kaleshm Pass which it has so long promised. This will enable goods to avoid the Baghdad-Khanikin detour and to proceed by rail from Tripolis to Nisibin, thence by road through Mosul to Tabriz; yet it is doubtful whether this route can compete for cheapness with the Russian railway that brings Tabriz within three days of Batum. The importance, therefore, of the Trebizond route to British interests in Persia can scarcely be over-estimated. SUSPECTS At this time of year the traveller who wishea to go from Persia to the Black Sea, without passing through Russian territory, will tind both the hand of man and of nature against him. Winter in these regions extends from October till the end of May, and in Erzerum snow in June is not uncommon. Since 1828, when by the Treaty of Turkmanchai Russia gained complete possession of the Araxes corridor, I urkish Armenia has gradually ceased to be part of the eastward caravan route, and the purposes of the traveller m transit are liable to be sus pected. On April 3, when I travelled from Khoi to Maku. the road presented an extraordinary appearance. At least seven miles were occupied by a column of Kurds, with their cattle, horses, camels and tents, moving southward under the urge of Persian bayonets. They were the rem nants of a tribe of the Jalali who, after the recent fighting near Maku, had attempted to seek refuge across the Turkish border. Turned back by the Turks, the Persian Government were now deporting them to strange lands south of Tabriz, employing in the twentieth century the methods of Cyrus and Darius. The i column seemed composed entirely of women and children; the few men that marched with them were a terrible commentary upon the ravages of long warfare. Tragic as the plight of these villagers probably was, they showed the resigna- tion which so often in the East has the appear- ! ance of content. In summer there is a practicable motor ; road from ‘Khoi through Ovajik, Kizil Dizi, Diadin and Erzerum, though permission to take a car across the frontier is difficult to obtain. In winter it is necessary to seek the lower levels of i the Araxes valley and to proceeti northward to Kars, the high part of the Kizil Dizi-Erzerura road being, passable only to sledge traffic. On | the Kars road motor traffic begms beyond Igdir, some seventy miles from the Persian border. As far as Bayezid I had a choice of pack-horse routes ; that through Ovajik and Kizil Dizi, and a far more picturesque one for seeing the Ararat area, which I chose, through Maku and Gorji Bulak. Maku, the las/ Persian place in which I slept, is a delightful stone-built town tucked in the side of a gorge under an overhanging rock. Its pale blue and yellow houses are already more Anatolian by ; appearance than Persian, and it is doubtful if a t word of Persian is spoken here; the most pro minent object in the town is the sickle and j hammer floating over the U.S.S.R. consulate, one of the numerous outposts of Russian State trading that have been established in Persian territory. A WILD ROAD I was unluckily forbidden to use the Russian chaussee to Bayezid, which, in company with the I derelict light railway from Arablaz on the ! Araxes, follows the marshy plain. Instead my ; two Kurd zaptiehs led me up a spur of Tondurek | Dagh to a height of nearly 9,000ft. The four hours’ ride which I had been promised thus became 13 hours, mainly on foot and through deep snow'. At the extreme height of this wild road, on which the only village was half deserted and destitute even of bread and youghort , there was an outbreak of machine* gun and rifle fire to the east, which my guides nonchalantly attributed to the “ Osmanlis and J the Kurds.” At sunset we entered the romantic citadel village of Bayezid, w’here my presence soon attracted the not too agreeable attentions of the military. For the next two days I was detained in a crowded and comfortless cafe, while the higher command and civil police between them played the favourite cait-and- l mouse game of giving me permits to leave and j then requisitioning the horses. At length, after | some 15 independent questionnaires from differ ent officers, my wishes were anticipated by my being marched off to Igdir under an armed ' guard. As a companion I had a Kurd sharp shooter who had been taken in the act, and now marched beside my horse, liis hands manacled in a sort of vice. Relations between prisoners and escort were, however, of the most friendly order as soon as the forbidding neighbourhood of Bayezid was left behind. A night was spent on the road in a pacified Kurd village on the slope of Ararat itself. Hero there was some opportunity of observing the wretched plight of the war-worn population. Bread, mostly compounded of chaff, and some appalling goat cheese w'ere exacted by the soldiers, but my hosts ate nothing except a bowl of well-watered milk which was given to the children; the meagre cattle shared the oommon room of the family, of which there were three generations, all under the autocratic Con-tA WkNotes.

AFTER hearing and reading various exaggerated statements of the numbers of the Turkish, I have preferred to accept the version of ^S^eral an of usually well-informed persons like the Armenian Archbishop and M. Ards P*3; that the Turks have 7,000 to 8,000 men around the Ararats and 4,000 men maximum from Bashkale and Shemzinan southwards, to deal with a new revolt 111 this district They appear to have fifteen aeroplanes, of which never more than five to six operate at one time. At least five aeroplanes appear to have been lost by them. 15. All reports show the Kurds to be well armed and to be fighting desperateh, and the Turks appear to meet with little serious success. i i rr 1 1 + 16. An attack made from Aralik southwards failed, and the Turks even lost their original two posts in the Aralik plain, and were driven across the Araxes into 17 There they were treated as guests, and their arms, which were at first taken away, were returned them, and they recrossed towards Igdir two days later. '18. It is believed here that the Russians are co-operating with the lurks, and it is even said that the Turkish reinforcements which made the above attack trom Aralik had reached their point of departure through the territory of the Armenian ► oviet^Repubhc^ot alt ther disbelieve this, as there appears no doubt that a mysterious force of unknown cavalry passed two nights near Davalu, and then was believed to have crossed the Araxes. This force was originally reported to me as Russian. ^ Russ } ans have strong forces near Igdir and Davalu and along the Araxes, and it is again alleged that some of their troops join m the fighting against the Kurds. —2 21. On the 3rd September it was reported to me that on the 22nd August the Turks made three further attacks on Ararat, and were each time repulsed with losses • 22. The general informed me that he was sure the Turks had opened negotia tions, and that if these failed, as they probably would, the campaign must stop before November, and the Kurds would then resume their forays on neighbouring iurkish He quite expected to see all Kurdistan, from Ararat to the Iraq frontier, in arms 23. The conviction here is that the Turkish successes near Ergish and Zilan were really gained over a few armed men and a large percentage of non-combatants. In Persia: 'Northern Zone. 24. On the 9th August, at 4 a.m., a band of some 200 to 300 Kurds, escaping from the Ararat zone, crossed into Persia and tried to surround a small Persian post. There was a panic, and the soldiers, mostly conscripts, ran away. Their two othcers and two n.c.o.'s resisted and were all killed. ... Reinforcements came up on both sides, including Khalid Agha of the J alali, m aid of the Kurds. The Kurds were finally driven back to the hills near Maku. ine Persian losses were probably 100 killed and wounded, and several wounded have since come in here, while severer cases remain at Khoi. The Kurdish losses were also considerable, and included Hassan Agha the uncle of Khalid Agha—and Mustafa Agha, who had been the leader of the revolt The Turks have thanked the Persians for their co-operation, but privately declared that they were delighted at the Persian losses, as the Persians had egged on Khalid Agha to attack the Turks, and had eventually been £ * hoist with their own Peta 26 The idea of a rectification of frontiers, embracing the surrender of the eastern slopes of Little Ararat to Turkey, is hotly rejected by all influential Persians, who declare such a surrender would mark the beginning of intensified pan-iurk propaganda, and pave the way for an eventual invasion—pacific or otherwise. 27. The raid of the Turks into Persian territory has been officially denied by the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs; but such circumstantial repoits of the bombino- of Kurds in Persian territory, of an advance of 10 kilom. into Persian territorv, of his representations urging the Turks to withdraw, &amp;c., had been previously given to me by the general, that I cannot attach the very least faith to the official dementi. . . , . ^ , .. Further, M. Ardsroony gave me circumstantial details of the lurkish operations from Bayezid towards the Persian frontier and of their intention to occupy Bulakbash. Troops f rom Tehran. 28 On the 14th August it was reported to me that troops were expected here from Tehran en route to Maku. None ever appeared, but:— In Persia: Southern Zone. 29 The o’eneral confirmed that he had stretched a strong cordon from feakiz to Sauj Bulak &amp; It seems quite possible that troops may have been moved towards Sakiz from outside Azerbaijan.Sir R. Clive to Mr. A. Henderson.—(Received September 18.) (No. 431.) Sir, Gulhek, September 3, 1930. I HAVE the honour to report that Memdouh Chevket Bey, the Turkish Ambassador, left Tehran on the 31st August. His successor is expected in a few days’ time. 2. The day before his departure Memdouh Chevket called to say good-bye, and I tried to elicit more clearly the reasons for his recall or resignation. He gave me to understand that the communiques and press reports emanating from Constanti nople and Angora had all been highly coloured, if not absolutely untrue. He insisted, for instance, that no ultimatum at all had ever been sent to the Persian Government, although, according to the press, no less than three had been delivered. He maintained that not one single Turkish soldier had entered Persia, nor had the Turkish Government at any time threatened to cross the frontier. I asked him then what was the grievance of the Turkish Government against the Persian Government ? He said they really had none at all, except that four years ago two well-known Turkish Kurdish chiefs had settled down on the Persian side of the frontier, and in spite of repeated protests from the Turkish Government and the usual promises by the Persian Government, no steps had been taken to remove them. On the other hand, the rectification of the frontier on the eastern side of Lesser Ararat was essential to Turkey, to enable her to control the situation in future. I then asked his Excellency, as tactfully as I could, whether he had been recalled by his Govern ment or whether he had resigned. He told me that he had resigned. Admittedly, at midsummer his views had not coincided with those of his Government. However, he assured me that the Turkish Government now understood the situation, and there was no cause of friction between the two Governments. At the same time, he was very glad to go. He had been here five years; he was not a diplomat by profession, and though later on he might be glad to have another post (his ambition, I understand, is to be Ambassador in Moscow), he was quite content to live quietly with his family in Constantinople. His real interests were the study of history and ethnology. 3. Finally, I asked him whether, in his opinion, the Soviet Government had been fishing in troubled waters and whether they were in any way responsible for the undoubted friction which existed between the Persian and Turkish Governments this summer. He denied this absolutely, and maintained that, on the Russian side of the frontier, although the Armenians, as always, were a potential source of danger, the Kurds were perfectly quiet, and he had no reason to suppose that the Soviet authorities had done anything to stir up trouble. This may be true, but there is no doubt that Memdouh Chevket, who was an intimate friend of Davtian, the late Soviet Ambassador here, has very strong Russian sympathies. 4. Yesterday afternoon, in the course of a visit to Teymourtache, I asked his Highness what were his views about the recent Kurdish trouble. He began by discoursing generally on Turkish politics. He maintained that Ismet Pasha had been the villian of the piece, and in order to strengthen his own position in Turkey had been responsible for the series of exaggerated press reports from Constantinople. Tewfik Rushdi Pasha he had never been able to take seriously. The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs had no convictions, and was at any moment ready to adopt a different policy. What he did not understand was the real attitude of the Gazi, who, on the one hand, had apparently done nothing to stop this anti-Persian press propaganda, while, on the other, he had always spoken in the most fulsome terms of Turco-Persian friendship. As regards Memdouh Chevket’s resignation, he maintained that this was undoubtedly brought about by the antagonism of the Turkish General Staff, who had accused him of being pro-Persian, and of being out of sympathy with the Turkish policy in Kurdistan. 5. His Highness then went on to speak of the Kurdish policy of the three countries, Turkey, Persia and Iraq. The policy, he said, was fundamentally different in each country. The Turkish Government, under Ismet Pasha, frankly [236 s—1]2 wanted to annihilate the Kurds, an impossible policy to maintain, as one could not annihilate a whole people. The Persian policy, he admitted, had been m the past to leave things alone. They had done nothing for the Persian Kurds; at the same time, they had tried to do nothing to annoy them. The Iraq Government, on the other hand, acting on the advice of the British authorities, had adopted a policy ot encouraging the Kurds by allowing them to maintain their language, by promising- them schools, and in other ways by trying to raise the general standard ot living among the Iraqi Kurds. This policy, he feared, must in the end have a disturbing effect both on the Turkish and the Persian Kurds, and he said frankly that it he were a Turkish or Persian Kurd, his whole sympathy would be with the policy ot the Iraq Government; as it was, however, he looked to the future wuth anxiety, and the Shah was undoubtedly perturbed. Although the Iraq Government might not be in favour of a united Kurdistan, yet their present policy had the appearance ot a first step in that direction. His Highness said that he had read the speeches winch Maior Young and Jaafar Pasha had recently made in Suleimameh, and though he quite realised the good faith of the Iraq Government and their British advisers in the matter, he wished to let me know frankly his own views. He endorsed Memdouh Chevket’s opinion about the correctness of the Soviet Government in this particular question, although he was equally suspicious of the Armenians. 6 Finally, I asked him about the question of frontier rectification on Lesser Ararat, and whether he though! the Turkish demands were reasonable. He said he was not prepared to express an opinion himself, but could only state that the Persian General Staff were most strongly opposed to any concession to the Turkish Government in that region, both from a strategic point of view, and also because a rectification of the frontier, such as the Turks wished for, would be greatly resented by the Kurds, and the w'hole odium would fall on the Persian Governinent. ^ ' 7 .

Tehran, A'pril 16, 1930. Enclosure in No. 1 . Sir R. Clive to Sir F. Humphrys. (No. 57.) Sir, Tehran, April 16, 1930. IN the course of an interview which I had yesterday with the Minister of Court his Highness expressed considerable anxiety on the subject of what he called “the Kurdish movement.’’ He said that the idea of a united Kurdistan was again being talked about, as was also the question of an independent Armenia. So far the Persian Kurds were, he believed, quite outside the movement, but the Turkish policy towards their Kurdish population had always been a source of anxiety to the Persian Government. At present there was said to be a so-called Kurdish Government in the neighbourhood of Mount Ararat, which even included a Minister for Foreign Affairs. 2. At the same time he had heard that there was a certain sympathy on the part of British officials in Iraq with the movement for an independent Kurdistan, and that Sheikh Mahmud had been approached by leaders of the movement. The Turkish press had recently reported that Colonel Lawrence was in Kurdistan, and he understood that this report had been reproduced in the native Iraq press. He said he would be very grateful if I could obtain any news on the subject from Bagdad. I told him that, first, as regards Colonel Lawrence, I was getting rather tired of hearing these stories of his presence in various parts of Western and Central Asia, and that, as regards the sympathy of British officials in Iraq with a pan-Kurdish movement, frankly I did not believe it. However, as he had asked me, I would report what he had' said to Bagdad for any observations which the High Commissioner might wish to make. 3. Teymourtache also referred in the course of his conversation to the “ Mussowat ” party for an independent Caucasia, whose headquarters were now in Constantinople. The programme of this group had always been inimical to Persia, as it included a “united’’ Azerbaijan comprising the whole Persian Province as far south as Zenjan. While the “Mussowat” party need not ba taken very seriously, it would be interesting to know, he said, what connexion, if any, they had with the present movements for an independent Armenia and a united Kurdistan. 4.

British Legation Tehran 12th July, 1929 Sir I have the honour to report that the Persian Government have recently appointed the following persons as members of the Turco-Persian frontier Commission: (1) Head of the Persian delegation: Miraa Nasrullah Khan Khal'at-Bari, formerly named 1 1 tila-ul-Mulfc. This official was the head of the Persian delegation to the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission of 1913, which was dealing with questions of delimitation of the frontier up to the beginning of the European War* Since then he has served the Persian Grovemment in various capacities; he was once head of the Turkish section of the Ministry for Foreign he acted for a short time as Minister for Foreign Affairs; he was Minister of Finance in March 1920 under Tussugh- ud-Douleh; and he was appointed Grovemor of Xfcrdistan in May 1926* He has not had much to do with this Legation recently: but in 1912 I read that he 'gave satisfaction'. (2) Greneral Abdul-Re*a Khan Afkhami, a soldier who has served on various staff appointments, in Kurdistan and Khorensan as well as in Tehran. He seems an efiicient and energetic officer. (3) Miraa Abbas Quli Khan Sharib, formerly Mutarjim-ul- Mhmalik, who is presumably the secretary to the delegation; he has served both in the Ministry of justice and in the Ministry of/ The Right Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P THE FOREIGN OFFICE.of Foreign Affaire. (4) Miraa Mohs in Kh&amp;n Ansar i, a minor official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as are the remaining two (5) Rafi 1 -ul-Mult, and (6) Sultan Salim. 2. The Persian press announces that the Persian delegation left Tehran on the 29th Jtme for Azerbaijan, where it was arranged that they should meet the Turkish delegation, presided orer by Fasil Bey. The work of delimitation was to hare started on the 1st July. 3 , I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople. I have etc., (Sd) R.H.

Mr. Edmonds to Sir Austen Chamberlain.—(Received April 22.) (No. 166.) Sir, Angora, April 16, 1929. I HAVE the honour to report, with reference to my telepram No. 12 of the 10th instant, that, from the Persian Ambassador and the Turkish Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, I understand the following to be the outline of the new Turco-Persian Agreement. 2. The question of the frontier is dealt with by an exchange of notes Faruki Khan explained that once he was convinced of the Turks good faith, he thought it better to sign an instrument which would be operative immediately, rather than one which might lose its validity through the postponement of ratification. He said also that he could not induce the Turkish Government to recognise the 1913 protocol. As usual, the Turkish Government was disinclined to recognise an obligation of the Ottoman Empire, and in particular it contended that the protocol had been forced upon Turkey at a time when she was too weak to resist. Enis Bey, loo, hinted that the flavour of Ottoman subservience to the two Great Powers had been enough to make the Turkish Government avoid all mention of the 1913 protocol. There was therefore no mention of that instrument in the notes exchanged. Nevertheless, both Faruki Khan and Enis Bey declared, the frontier described in the notes was that of the protocol except at the following three points :— (i.) In the extreme north, Bulakbashi, which is still occupied by the Turks and which was on the h’usso-Persian frontier until the Turco-Uussiau Treaty of Kars of the 13th October, 1921. (in) The district of Kotur to the west, of which Persia, under the Sarikamish protocol, claims certain villages still occupied by the Turks. (iii.) Two small villages still further south called Siro and Sartex, which in the past have occasionally been occupied by Turkey. In the summer a mixed commission is to proceed to the spot to agree on the frontier at these three places and mark it out. Failing agreement, there is to be arbitration. It will also set up the pillars again, where they are missing, on the rest of the frontier. 3 . It would appear, then, that the agreement does little more than shift to the sl oulders of a boundary commission the problems which have detied Faruki Khan and Tewfik Rushdi Bey. The former, however, is fairly confident that if the Turkish delegates are reasonable men, an agreement will be reached. Enis Bey also seems to anticipate agreement. Faruki Khan declares that there is no substantial cession of ground nor any frontier modification of political or military importance, the areas in dispute amounting to only a few square miles. He believes that the Turkish Govern ment attaches no real importance to Siro and Sartek, but threw in a demand for them merely as a makeweight. I got the same impression from Enis Bey. The whole dispute, therefore, seems to amount on the one side and the other to a question of amour-propre. 4. Frontier security is dealt with separately in a convention much on the lines of the British-Turkish-Iraki Treaty of the 5th June, 1926. It sets up a permanent frontier commission which is to meet at least twice a year. It provides for continual intercourse and collaboration between the frontier officials of both parties. It also lays down measures to prevent the journeyings of agitators, but Faruki Khan is under the impression that, the Kurdish situation being rather easier, the Turkish Government takes less interest in these measures than it would have done two years ago. 5. 1 am sending a copy of this despatch to the British High Commissioner at Bagdad and to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran.

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 44 of the 30th January regarding the ratification of the Turco-Persian treaty of the 22nd April, 1926, and the additional protocol of the 15th June, 1928. 2. Both treaty and protocol were submitted to the Majlis on the 6 th December last, and were referred to the appropriate parliamentary commission, where they still remain. My German colleague told a member of my staff that he had heard from the Turkish Ambassador that a hitch had occurred, as the Persians desire, as the price of ratification of the treaty and protocol, Turkish adherence to the 1913 frontier delimitation and the evacuation of the strip of territory which the Turks have occupied beyond the 1913 line. There have, it appears, been certain negotiations here and at Angora, but without result. 2. If the Persian Government have, indeed, made their ratification dependent on formal Turkish acceptance of the 1913 frontier, it is very significant, but I can hardly believe that this is the whole story, as Taimourtache continues to question the “ transferred territory ” on the Iraq frontier, although the Persian Government have never raised this officially, and I doubt if they ever will. 3 .

IN my despatch No. 55 of the 5th instant, I had the honour to inform you that the Persian Ambassador would shortly resume his frontier discussions with the Turkish Government. 2. Faruki Khan, who leaves this evening for Geneva, has now been here for six days, and in that period has had at least one prolonged interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. He has, however, confided to a member of my staff that no real progress has been made. The two parties are now, according to Faruki Khan, in agreement as regards co-operation between frontier authorities, and the Ambassador appeared relieved to learn that the existing arrangements on the Iraqi-Turkish frontier viere working quite satisfactorily. 3. The real difficulties are apparently being encountered over the actual frontier line. Faruki Khan stated that he had done his utmost to get the 1914 line accepted without modification, but, though the Persian Government would probably be prepared to be accommodating over the delimitation of the short northern sector of the line, which was not contemplated on the outbreak of war in 1914, he had now become convinced that the Turkish Government would not stand by the 1914 agree ment, and that a separate frontier protocol would become necessary. Unfortunately, the Turkish Government had in the interval occupied, and now refused to evacuate, one or two areas beyond the delimitated frontier of 1914. The Persian Government likewise refused to surrender territory which had been assigned to Persia in 1914, and for the moment a deadlock had been reached. 4. In conclusion, Faruki Khan stated that he would be back in Angora towards the end of March. He thought that the Turkish Government honestly desired a settlement and, such being the case, he did not altogether despair of reaching one on bis return. 5 .

But, according to reports which have recently been communicated confidentially to &amp; member of my staff by the Irak Minister, events have recently taken place in Kurdistan which have decided the Turkish Covernsnent to make serious efforts to brin* these negotiations to an end. 3.

Sir, 'Jith reference to my despatch ho. 314 of the 27th June last, I have the honour to report that no conclusion was apparently reached in the negotiations of the Turco- Persian frontier protocol before the Turkish .Minister for Foreign Affairs departed for his cure at Vienna. 2. In an interview given to the Press Feroughi Khan, while emphasising the cordial nature of the relations between the two countries which had rendered possible the settlement of a large number of outstanding questions, admitted tnat there still remained other points to resolve. He looked forward to this final solution after the return of himself and Tewfik Rushdi Bey from their respective holidays abroad. 3 . The resumption of negotiations is therefore postponed for at least two months, at the end of which time Feroughi Khan will doubtless have received his credentials from Tehran, as he regretfully confessed the other day that tney were already on the way. The failure to reach a settlement without a suspension of the negotiations, especially at tne time when relations between the two countries have the appearance of being unusually cordial, may however be taken as a measure of the differences which still separate them on frontier natters, and seem to give the lie to a report two days ago of the semi-official 'Killiet” that the negotiations had been completely concluded in principle.

Sir, In the fourth paragraph of my despatch i.o. 30.3 of June 20th I had the honour to refer to the reported impending signature at Angora of the Turco- Persian frontier protocol which has been under negotiation for some months past. 2. Though the Press continues to state that such signature will take place immediately, my latest information, received from the Irak Charge d’Affaires who has just returned here after a short visit to the capital, is far from confirming this. Sabih Bey has succeeded since his arrival in Angora in establishing cordial relations with I’eroughi Khan, and the latter confessed to him last week that things were not going at all well. Peroughi Khan did not specify the particular points which were causing difficulty but seemed to despair of arriving at a solution. The impending departure for a cure in the vicinity of Vienna of the inister for Foreign Affairs had brought matters to a head. Tewfik Rushdi Bey had desired that Peroughi Than should continue the negotiations after his departure with the Under Secretary but to this the Persian delegate demurred stating that, if Tewfik Rushdi Bey left Angora, he also would take his departure. It wa» thus for the inister for Foreign Affairs to decide whether or not he would come to terms in the short time now available. It is now reported that the inister for Foreign Affairs willi h. &amp; will leave Angora this week so that the conclusion of a last minute agreement is possible, if the new phase of kirco-Persian collaboration is to be opened under favourable auspices. 3. Meanwhile, according to Sabih Bey, Feroughi Khan is by no means enamoured of the prospect of remaining as Persian Ambassador to Turkey, The Press reports that the Turkish Government has already given its agreement but Feroughi declares that his only object is to conclude his negotiations one way or another and return to Tehran where he has matters requiring his immediate attention. 4.

There was, he said, no question of a new treaty but of a 'protocol© d f application' of the relevant clauses of the existing Turco-Persian treaty of April 22nd, 1926. furthermore, there was no question of frontier modification. The boundary was to be left as settled in 1913. 2. In order to check this statement X caused feroughi Khan to be sounded in Constantinople. What he said was confirmatory. The Turks were concerned to make the frontier safe, the Persians to have it fixed. The two parties were therefore now engaged in working out an amplification of certain articles (evidently 6 and 6 ) in the 1926 treaty. They also had to provide for marking out the frontier, as on the outbreak of the war the work of delimitation had been left incomplete and subsequently the Turks had deliberately knocked down the pillars on other sections of the boundary. Without saying so explicitly, he implied The Ri^it Honourable Sir Austen Chamberlain, K.O.. M.P., etc., etc., etc.implied that the boundary to be followed irae the old one of 1913. 3. Feroughi Khan hopes to conclude the negotiations as soon as Tewfik Kuahdi Bey retimia to Angora, but he has enough knowledge of diplomatic dealings here to be afraid of a hitch at the elewenth hour. 4. 1 fm sending copies of this despatch to the British High Commissioner at Baghdad and to Hie Majesty’s Minister at Tehran.

Cleric aduressdd to you his despatch Ho.77, the subject of the Turco- Persian negotiations has been constantly aired in the Press and, though Feroughi Khan has not yet returned to Angora, frequent reports have appeared to the effect that final agreement has been reached. It has even been suggested that there will be no necessity for Feroughi Khan to return to Angora at all and that the agreement will be signed in Constantinople on Tevfilc Rushdi Bey's return from Geneva. 2 . It would appear that such views are at least premature: up to a few days ago at any rate they were not shared by Feroughi Khan himself who told a member of my Staff in Constantinople that the negotiations were making slow progress, that he was finding the Turks very difficult and that he was awaiting further instructions from his Government before returning to Angora. 3 . In the course of a recent conversation with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, I asked him how the matter stood. Shukri Kaya Bey was airily non-committal and gave me little more than his personal view that he saw little good in concluding agreements with States which their Governments were unable effectively to control/ The Right Honourable, Sir Austen Chamberlain, K.G., M.P., etc., etc., etc.control.

Relations between Persia and Iraq. 12th January (P.774) is of interest as snowing tne importance attached by the Persian Government to a satisfactory settlement with Iraq, and the subsequent telegrams from Teheran of the 17th and 18th February reporting the unfortunate reaction on the general negotiations with Persia of the alleged unfriendly attitude of Iraq officials towards Persians in that country go to confirm the views expressed in tne earlier despatch, as to the anxiety of Persia to arrive at a modus viv endi on terms satisfactory to the Persian Government. The despatch of the 12th January is of interest apart from the immediate question of relations between Persia and Iraq for the light which it throws on the Turkish attitude towards the revision of the 1913 frontier delimitation arrangement.From other papers which we have had from the Foreign Office, it appears that the Turco-Persian negotiations on this point are advancing exceedingly slowly, and that each party is endeavouring to bring pressure to bear on the other by means of carefully arranged press articles. So far as the settlement bears on relations between Persia and Iraq, it will be seen that the Foreign Office in their telegram of the 14th February, ho.31, have instructed Sir Robert Clive to make it quite clear that His Majesty’s Government consider the question &lt;is settled and not open to discussion, and are not prepared to acquiesce in making Iraq pay for Persian concessions to Turkey; and that no assistance can be looked for from them to an endeavour to secure revision 201 * 5000 5.27 inin the favour of Persia. So far as the Shatt-al-Arab is concerned, it would appear that the Persians have something of a case, but on this point also it is to be made clear to them that a settlement can only be reached in negotiation with Iraq.

Tehran, January 12, 1928. 11 ’ AS 1 shall not have a further opportunity to see the Minister of Court before the ban leaves, 1 will attempt to clarify the summary given in my telegram No. 11 ot the 9th January of his Excellency’s remarks on the subject of Iraq. . , , 9 Taimourtache gave me to understand that a satisfactory settlement with Iraq was one of the most important questions for the Persian Government and to that end the good offices of His Majesty’s Government would be of the greatest value. He did not actually speak of recognition and is perhaps waiting for some expression of views from His Majesty’s Government on the question of the special courts as proposed in the formula given in my despatch No. 572 of the 25th November last and subsequently further modified by his Excellency in conversation (see my telegram No. dod of the 9 9th December J927). He spoke, however, without going into details, of tlie irontiei question He said Turkey did not admit the validity of the 1913 protocol. It was not Persia which had disputed this, but Turkey. Protracted negotiations were now in progress in Angora, in order to reach a settlement of the Kurdish question on the present Turco-Persian frontier in Azerbaijan. The Irontier Commission m 1913 14 had laid down a sound geographical frontier with which the Persian Government were quite content. If, however, the Turks were to persist in their present attitude, where would Persia be? She might be forced to lose her good frontier in Azerbaijan while being held to her present frontier with Iraq where m many places she had had to vield territorv. That was not fair and if the protocol was denounced by one party the other party could not be bound by it. In other words the protocol lapsed. 3 . I 1 made no comment on this beyond repeating what 1 had said to Muntakhab- ul-Mulk, head of the English section in the Ministry for foreign Afhnrs, as reported in my telegram No. 5 of the 2nd January, namely that His Majesty s Government considered the frontier as laid down as chose j uqee and not open to discussion, although if Persia arranged by diplomatic means with either or both ol her neighbours for some slight rectification my Government would have no objection. 4. Taimourtache, -who had evidently sent Muntakhab-ul-Mulk to raise the question with me, was aware of the reply I had made. . . . T 5. He went on to say that there were other important matters to settle with Iraq and he hoped that he could count on the support of His Majesty s Government to help in reaching a settlement. . , ., . , ^ 6. Although his Excellency did not go into details in regard to the hontiei question, I have the impression that what he principally had m mind was the bhatt-al- Arab and the desire of the Persian Government that the frontier should be fixed m mid-stream instead of the left bank at low water as at present. Ihis is certainly a very natural desire on the part of the Persian Government and one which has become more urgent in the course of the present year from the point of view of the southern terminus of the railway. Nobody has been deceived by the talk of Khormusa. Everyone realises that if the southern section of the railway is ever to be built Mohammerah is the natural and obvious terminus. , , t . . , , 7 1 am not sending a copv of this despatch to Bagdad, but should be gia.eful to learn whether you would wish me to give any encouragement to his Excellency in regard to the Shatt-al-Arab frontier in case I am right in thinking that that was what he chiefly had in mind. r tt- • * ’ n . „ ~ * 8 Another way, no doubt, in which the good offices of His Majesty s Government would be highly appreciated would be it it were possible by any means to influence the Turkish Government to accept the frontier agreed to in 1913. Ihe Eemian Government have not asked for our good offices in this connexion and any interierence on our part might well be resented by the Turkish Government, It is with diffidence, therefore, that I mention this. [3&amp;0 f—11]2 9. It will have been noted, however, that Taimourtache, in speaking of a general settlement, emphasised the need for reciprocal advantages if the terms of such a settlement were to gain the approval of the Majlis and the support of the Persian Government. I make no mention of Bahrein as I am not in possession of your views. I would only draw attention to the fact that a (from a Persian point of view) satisfac tory settlement with Iraq was the point which in our first discussion his kxcellency brought out as the most important for Persia and one in which the good ofiices of His Majesty’s Government were essential.

(160/4/28) 0?0 British Embassy, Constantinople, 1st February, 1928. Sir, Hecent reports ending with my despatch No.52 of the 26th of January last on the subject of Turco- frursian relations call for amplification on one point. 2. When Memdouh Shevket Bey left Angora for Constantlnopi.e am Tehran, he was accompanied as far as the former city by Mahommed Ali Khan Feroughi, who was reported to be returning to Constantinople to await the receipt of instructions from his Government, to whom he had reported the present state of the negotiations. 3. To a reporter on the platform at Constantinople Memdouh Shevket Bey stated that 'the frontiers and the tribes are the subject of our present conversations.** 4. This statement was confirmed by the Persian envoy in an informal conversation at luncheon with me to-day in the course of which Mahonmad Ali Khan alleged that the Turkish Government had categorically refused to recognize the sanctity of the Turco-persian boundary delimitation of 1914 on the ground that they had ’’abrogated every treaty made by their predecessors and consequently did not hold themselves bound by this agreement.' 5. The upshot however seems to have been considerable perplexity on the part of the Persian envoy, if not of the Persian Government itself, as to the manner in which to persuade the Turkish Qorevxment of the necessity of respecting the 1914 agreement, the Turks having apparently violated the frontier in certain places and even revived to some extent their wartime claims to Persian soil in Azerbaijan. The Bight Honourable 8tr c Charao #fc 1 ‘, ln '(&amp;&gt;&gt; Feroughl 'dies hard in Turkey' and the Persian emroy has taken the obvious step of asking for instructions from Tehran and sitting down the while to enjoy Constantinople after a second arduous period of forty-five days at Angora * 6 . All this is of importance to His Majesty’s Government only if it leads to the validity of the Perso- Ire.q frontier being called into question by a Government desirous at least of offsetting its losses to Turkey by a \ corresponding gain from Iraq. 7.

British Embassy, A1TG0BA 22nd November, 1927 4 Sir, With reference to my despatch No. 569 of the 17th instant, relative to the discussions of Eeroughi Khan with the Turkish Government, I have the honour to report that I took advantage of my visit to Angora to ask both the Minister for Eoreign Affairs and Eeroughi Khan how matters stood between them. 2. The former said, as he had said to me the last time I was here, that the Turkish Government wanted two quite reasonable things: firstly, to be assured that Kurdish bands, after attacking and killing Turkish troops, would not be able to escape by just stepping across the frontier: and, secondly, the frontier line must be put on a juridical basis. Turkey, as constituted to-day, could not recognize the 1913 protocol as a juridical instrument, but ail His Excellency wished to do was to re-affirm it in a more proper form, with possibly some very insignificant modifications of the actual line which experience had shewn to be desiraole. 3. peroughi Khan said he was not quite clear as to whether the Turks wanted any change in the frontier, and he seemed a little vague about Tewfik Rushdi ! s wish for a new Treaty or protocol or whatever it might be, but what he had no doubt about was that Turkey wanted Persia to deal dras tically with any Kurds that came across the boundary - an undertaking that, to judge from Eeroughi Khan«s Ps'k H 4 expression, The Right Honourable, SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, K.G., M.P.,expression, would be as little to the liking, as it was in the power, of the Persian Government. Anyhow, he had referred to Tehran, and was awaiting the reply. 4. I have sent a copy of this despatch to His Majesty»s Minister in Tehran. I have, etc., (Signed) George H. Clerk.r Copy tto.569. (3212/108/1927} (E 4959/2822/34) British Embassy, Constantinople. November 17th, 1927 Sir Since my despatch No.523 of the 19th October last there has been little news about the progress of the furco- Persian negotiations but it is significant of the Turkish attitude that the 'Jumhuriet' of 11th November should have announced that Peroughi had only the day before had his first official interview with the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs on this subject. A full month appears thus to have been wasted on preliminaries, although another Press article recently announced that the two Governments had agreed to settle local border-troubles by means of a mixed Commission apparently similar to the Turco-Iraq Permanent Frontier Commission. 2. Yesterday the 'Journal d'Orient', the local Jewish organ of Constantinople, reproduced an article from the 'Economists d'Orient', of which I beg leave to enclose a copy, wherein the writer gives vent to his inimical feelings towards both Persia and Great Britain. The latter is not specifically mentioned, but references to the Bakhtiari Ehans, to the Basra trade-route and to the subsidies paid to Persian chieftains of old leave no doubt as to which foreign government is being accused of leading Persia away from her friendly neighbour and causing her to follow the path of stubborn resistance to Turkish demands. 3 Apart from a certain somewhat intimate if inaccurate knowledge of Persian history the article is chiefly of interest because of its resemblance to the customary The Right Honourable, SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, K.G., M.P etc., etc., et 1 Soviet • * etc.Copy. (E 4736/E8E2/34) No. 511. BRITISH LEGATION TEHRAN. October 21st, 1927 Sir I have the honour to forward herewith, with reference to my very secret telegram No. 183 of the 7th October, a copy in translation of a statement published in the Persian Press by the Ministry for foreign Affairs regarding the recent Turkish note threatening a rupture of diplomatic relations of certain specified reparation were not made within ten days by the Persian Government for an incident that occurred on the Azerbaijan frontier. 2. from the Persian statement it appears that the Turkish Government attempted to fasten responsibility on to the Persians for the attack by Kurds on their troops; but such information as I have received from Persian Azerbaijan justifies the Persian repudiation of this responsibility and their contention that the attackers were mainly Kurds domiciled in Turkey against whom the Turks are carrying out punitive operations. 3. As I reported in my telegram No. 184 of the 10th October I believe this incident has been settled by the return to Turkey of the captured officers and men, i.e. of 5 officers and 9 men although the Turkish Charg6. d* Affaires told me there were still some 30 more Turkish soldiers in the hands of the Kurds whom the Persians had so far been unable to release; but it is too much to expect that / The Right Honourable Sir Austen Chamberlain, A.G., M.P., foreign Officethat tension on this frontier has been more than temporarily eased* I have good reason to believe that in this instance the Soviet Government used its influence to effect a settle ment and th^t it would welcome an invitation to act as arbitrator on the several questions in dispute on this frontier* ihese questions are referred to in the Persian statement and they will doubtless be discussed at Angora by Mirza Mohamed Ali Ahan Peroughi whose arrival there has been reported. 4. The latest information that has reached me from Western Azerbaijan is that the Turks have recently had some successes against the Kurds in the Ararat region* 5* Copies of this despatch and of its enclosure are being sent to the foreign Secretary to the Government of India, to His Majesty's Acting High Commissioner for ^raq. His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople and to His Majesty's Consul at Tabriz* I have, etc., (Sgd) R.H.Clive.Extract from the SQridi t dat6d th6 IQtli QctolJfer 1927• The following official statement fcy the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to the Press representatives has been published:- The Turkish Charge d'Affaires in a letter dated the 5th September asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs that as the Turkish Government would commence operations within the month of (ILoul) against the Kurds who had committed outrages on the frontier, would the Persian uovernment check those Kurds taking refuge in Persian territory. The Persian Government were also requested to cooperate with the Turkish Government in making the measures adopted by the latter Government effective. On the 19th Shahrivar and again on the 4th Mahr the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed the Turkish Embassy that as a matter of course the Turkish Government were at liberty to punish their own tribes and that the Persian Government, in their endeavour to strengthen relations with the Turkish Government and owing to the fact that Turkey is a neighbouring country, will, despite the Turkish Governments short notice and delay in notifying the Persian Government, put their tribes under surveillance so that they may be prevented from lending assistance to the Turkish Kurds. Also in order to avoid the possibility of the frontier tribes taking action owing to their relationship the Persian Government will endeavour to make those tribes leave the frontiers and reside in Persian territory. The Military and frontier authorities were also instructed to prevent the sojourn of tribal refugees who may flee to Persian territory in consequence of the operations of the Turkish juTlitary. A senior officer had been detailed to see that the /the instructions were carried out and to see that no individual Kurdish rebels crossed the Persian frontier. At the same time the Persian Government once more informed the Turkish Goverment that unless the frontier differences which had arisen owing to the action of the Turkish Govern ment were settled and the transgressxon of Persian territory by armed Turkish forces and frontier agents was stopped and that unless the frontier problems were solved in such a way that the raids of armed Turkish brigands might be prevented from raiding the Persian frontier, the cooperation of the Persian Government in its strictest sense with the Turkish Government would be impossible. In reply to the letter dated the 19th Shahrivar the Turkish Charge d*Affaires thanked the Persian Government in the name of his Government. Despite all the assistance afforded by the Persian Government who fulfilled its duties as a friendly and neighbouring country, a report was received some time ago that a Turkish aeroplane had crossed the Persian border and bombed Persian territory in consequence of which a few people were wounded and also that Turkish troops had raided the frontier post at Sardar Bolaghi and set the place on fire. Meanwhile a letter was received from the Turkish Charge d'Affaires stating that a column of Turkish troops moving in Turkish territory had been ambushed by Kurdish tribes and as a result 44 men, a few officers and five machine guns had been captured by their assailants and had been carried away to Persian soil. The Turkish Charge d'Affaires re quested the release of the captives, delivery of the arms, compensation for the loss and an apology by the Persian Government for the incident within ten days, and added that if the request was not complied with severance of political relations /relations would be inevitable* It is bardly necest-ary to say bow much the letter caused surprise and regret oi the Persian Government especially when it learned irom the captive Turkish officers who had fled to the Persian irontier posts that; (Here one of the Turkish officers captured by the insurgents narrates the incident and says that they were attacked by a band of Turkish insurgent iuirds ) • At any rate the above officer has been received by the Persian authorities in a very friendly manner and was sent to the Turkish military post* On the 13th Mehr the Minister for foreign Affairs gave a detailed answer to the Turkish 'Embassy*s note and, according to the evidence which was in his possession, refuted the statements of the Turkish Embassy. The Ministry said that the Persian Government could accept no responsibility if the Turkish troops were attacked in Turkish territory by a band of Turkish uurds due to carelessness of the troops; to attribute the incident to the Persian Government was unjustifiable and a subject of protest by the Persian Government; the Persian Government had no confirmatory information with regard 10 the taking of the captured arras to Persian territory but reports xrom Persian sources discredited the news; in any case the matter was worthy of investigation and in consequence the Persian Government could not accept the time limit and the contents of the Turkish note dated the 1st of October. The Persian Government however suggested that a Commission composed of Persian and Turkish representatives be detailed to investigate the matter so that light may be thrown on the affair and so that the Persian Government might take steps if any of the insurgents were in Persian territory. Although the receipt of the above note, as stated above, caused much surprise and regret on the part oi the Persian Government still we do not despair oi seeing the lundamental policy of the two Governments and the high interests oi thetwo nations getting the better of passion and a way of Pro ceeding which is perhaps not dictated by the statesmen and wise men of Turkey who are in charge of foreign relations. We hope that the Turkish Government, taking into consider ation the ill effects which may accumulate from obscurity of Perso-Turkish relations, may at last show signs of the same good attitude and peaceful measures as expressed by the Persian Government and that the question may be solved favourably '— _ [E 4398/2 (No. 512.)

Constantinople, October 13, 1927. ’ WITH reference to my despatch No. 500 of the 4th instant concerning the recent disorders on the Turco-Persian frontier, I have the honour to inform you that, according to information supplied by His Majesty s consul at Irebizond, the attacking band consisted of Kurdish tribesmen who had fled from Turkey in order to escape deportation. From Persian territory they combined with other Kurds to direct a successful attack across the frontier against Bayezid, whence they carried off a number of Turkish officers and soldiers, some of whom are still prisoners. Four regiments belonging to the 9th and 12th divisions have been engaged in suppressing the disorders; the administration of the Vilayet of Bayezid has been removed to Kara Kilisseh—some 70 miles from the frontier. Transit trade between the two countries has been suspended for three weeks, but it is expected that the provision of strong military escorts will make it possible again via Igdir. 2. Faruki Khan, the former Persian Minister of War, has arrived in Constantinople from Switzerland, and is proceeding at once to Angora to discuss with the Turkish Government the question of responsibility for these disorders and of the measures to be taken to prevent their repetition. 3. It is curious that the Turks seem ready to believe the rumour that these disorders have been fomented by His Majesty’s Government from Bagdad. Even a prominent Turkish official mentioned this to-day in a private conversation with a member of the British business community, and when the latter laughed at the suggestion he gravely added that, loth as he was to believe it, the proofs were overwhelming. . , 4.

Meanwhile, the outcry in the Turkish press has subsided. 1 understand that the Turkish note to the Persian Government demanded that the Persians should either take effective measures against the Kurds themselves or else allow Turkish troops to cross into Persia to do so. The press expresses satisfaction at the measures already taken by the Persians, which have led to the release of a large number of the captured officers and men, but plain hints are given that Persia will be expected to continue the same measure of support. , 1 . .. . 6. Before leaving for Angora, Faruki Khan expressed himself in most conciliatory terms to press representatives who interviewed him. It appeared to him that Kurdish rebels had, in fact, escaped into Persia, but he thought it most unlikely that they had met with any support from the Persian population in general, although a few scattered tribes might have joined forces with them. In any event, his Government, having alreadv chosen him to settle questions ontstanding__w ith Turkey, had on the occurrence of these regrettable incidents, ordered him to proceed as soon as possible to Angora. Turkey desired the help of Persia in punishing the rebels and he could say emphatically that Persia would do her best to satisfy lurkey. 7 I am sending copy of this despatch to the Acting High Commissioner for Iraq and to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. ^ I have, &amp;c.

Mahmoud Bey, deputy for Sert (and at present a candidate for the Ministry for oreign Affairs should Tewfik Rushdi be replaced) roundly aocuses the Persian Government in his semi-official paper the 'Milliet' of affording protection to the Kurdish insurgents. Yunus Bad! Bey, editor of the 'Jumhuriet” is a little more moderate in that he admits that tbs Persian Government may not itself have had knowledge of events on the Turoo-lersian border; but he adds that it must be held responsible for the least of the acts committed on its territory and that impotence is no excuse. 3. It appears from the somewhat hazy communiques issued by the Agence d*Anatolie that the Kurdish bands have recently been growing bolder and that the twwn of Bay&amp;wid received, an unwelcome visit from them not long ago. The Turii&lt;oh *ress is careful to say that they were promptly routed and pursued to the frontier; but is constrained to admit that a ijmall detachment of Turkish troops was rounded upon by the insurgents and practically wiped out; its officers being taken prisoner and remaining up to the present in Tebel hands* The inference is that the rebels are in Persia, though this is not actually stated. The Press holds Persia responsible for releasing the captives/ The Right Honourable Sir Austen Chamberlain, K.G*,M.P., etc., etc. t etc#captives and returning them to Turkey and it is evidently this blow to the Government’s prestige that has occasioned the storm I have just reported. 4. The Persian Charge d'Afiaires is now in Angora and is said to have sent a full report of the state of public o?inion, as represented in uhe Press, to his Government. Doubtless the Turkish Government is trying to induce its neighbour to take more effective measures for closing the frontier to the Kurdish lands seeking refuge from Turkish pursuit. His Imperial Majesty’fteza Shah is stated to be at present in Tabriz and urgent instructions have apparently been sent to iPeroughi Khan, Minister for War, to leave Switzerland and repair to Angora to discuss the matter with the Turkish Government. If this be true the Persian Government have been duly impressed by the outcry in the Turkish Press; but whether the docile Persian envoy oan galvanise his country into giving effect to the Turkish demands remains to be seen. 5. It is doubtless important for the Turkish Government to deal with the insurgents while the winter snows deny the latter their summer retreats among the high momtains in the Ararat triangle and for this reason they wish Persian help to be swift. The only person likely to be able to give them this help in Persia is the Shah himself and his journey to Tabriz is therefore of some interest to the Turkish Government. 6. It is interesting to note that in every press article the policy of stern repression if not of extermination which the Turkish Government is relentlessly pursuing towards its Kurdish minority is solemnly represented as civilisation and enlightenment of reactionary elements. 7* I am sending copies of this despatch direct to His Majesty’s Minister at Teheran and to the High Commissioner for Irak at Baghdad. 1 have etc. # (Sd) Gr;0RG£ R.

(No. 435.) . ‘ Therafia, August 16, 1927. ’ DURING the last few days the subject of Turco-Persian relations has received a certain amount of attention at the hands of the Turkish P r ^ss. ^ 2. Simultaneously with the arrival here on leave of Memduh ev ^ y, Turkish Minister at Tehran, the “ Republique ” published in leaded type the news that the Minister had unexpectedly arrived, as the Turkish Government wished to consult him regarding the present delicate nature of Turco-Persian relations^ In a leading article in the same newspaper Yunus Nadi Bey developed the theme and quoted at length from the Persian newspapers “ Iran and Jennet, which, l) asi g themselves on incursions of small armed parties from Turkey into Persl £&gt; published articles accusing Turkey of imperialistic designs and tending o 3e the Turkish struggle for independence. The sting of the articles lay in this latter insinuation, and Yunus Nadi Bey, like other editors on subsequent days, was not slow to take it up. The accusation of Turkish frontier raids has not been denied, but the general line taken is that these incidents are of minor importance that they are unavoidable along a land frontier dividing countries like Turkey and I ersia, and that they should not be allowed to disturb the friendly relations existing between the two neighbouring States. . . . , , .i f 3 But Yunus Nadi Bey pointed out the Persian press is so unimportant that it could not have launched an anti-Turkish campaign without prompting i hat had without doubt, been furnished from abroad. Persia had had her revolution, but the traditional Anglo-Russian influence and rivalry in Persia had not been killed. U e of these two Powers—the writer did not specify which—was behind these machina tions and the good Persian people would be better advised to make an end ot the foreign intrigues in their midst than to imagine danger in unimportant frontier mu en started the hare, the “ Bepublique remained silent for a few days, but yesterday returned to the subject by reproducing an item from the Neue Ireie Presse ' which, it stated, confirmed its worst fears. According to the Viennese oro'an Great Britain was now taking a stronger line in Persia, where she sought to re establish her w aning influence, and evidence of this was to be found in tne dismissal of Dr. Millspaugh, the American Financial Adviser. No further comment was made, but the suggestion was no less definite that Great Britain was endeavouring to make trouble between Turkey and Persia. . , 5 The matter had, in the meantime, been to some extent taken up by the other newspapers, though in these references to foreign intrigue were absent. 1 he Persian Embassy and Memduh Shevket Bey were bombarded by reporters, who, however &lt;rot little for their pains ’ The former P rofessed have 110 knowledge of the Persian press campaign and announced that frontier incidents would not be allowed to disturb the friendly relations so happily existing between the two countries. I he Minister on the other hand, pleaded inability to make a statement until he had reported to Ismet Pasha and the Minister for Foreign x\ffairs, the latter of whom he has now o'one to see at Angora. He did, nevertheless, say that the anti-Turkish nublications of the Persian press had commenced nearly two months ago, and from this I infer that they are based on the advancement of Turkish frontier posts which Mr Clive reported to you in his telegram No. 121 of the 25th June. ’ 6 Though it is reported that one result of these mutual press recriminations has been the suspension of negotiations for the conclusion of Commercial and Residence Conventions between Turkey and Persia, it is announced that an l ‘ important but unnamed, Persian politician, who may be the Minister for Foreign Affairs now it is understood, in Moscow, will shortly arrive here and proceed to Angora Moreover, it is evident that the counter-attack launched by Yunus Nadi Bev has not the entire support of the Turkish Government, for the semi-official [212 y—1]“ Milliet ' has published a very moderately worded leading article on the subject. Mahmud Bey chooses to regard the writers of the Persian press articles as persons of no importance, and as not in any way representing the Government of Persia or its Shah, who is determined at any price to assure the progress and modernisation of the Persian nation. “ If, therefore,” concludes Mahmud Bey, ' we must express an opinion on this question, we associate ourselves with the Persian Charge d Affaires^ in saying that by publishing news tending to show that there is tension between th&lt; two countries we are serving those whose desire is to injure both countries Such questions of secondary importance as frontier incidents are far from being of a nature to disturb the cordial relations of the Turkish and Persian nations, whose interests and destinies are so intimately connected.” 7.

Memdouh Chevket Bey made light of the question of the actual frontier and said there would be no difficulty in settling that with the Persian Government. When I pointed out that I understood the frontier had been finally settled under the 1912 protocol by the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission, he replied that the findings of the Commission had never been ratified by the Turkish Government. The Ambassador went on to say that the real difficulty was how to deal with the Kurds on the frontier. The Turkish Authorities had done their best to disarm them, but they found that these Kurdish raiders were always able to purchase arms on the Persian side of the frontier. I said I was very surprised to hear this as the Persian Government maintained that these Kurds obtained their arms from Turkish sources. The Ambassador repeated that this was quite impossible. In any case the problem, and it was a very acute one, was to prevent the Kurds making trouble. He did not appear to favour the policy of extermination, but talked vaguely of educating and civilising them. 2 •... • The Bight Honourable Sir Austen Chamberlain, K.G., M*P., FOBEIGK OlFICH.3. A few days later I asked the Acting Minister for i'or.eign Affairs where there had been ; ny new developments in the situation. I told him of my conversation with the Turkish Ambassador. Pakravan said that His Excellency had not accused the Persians of furnishing the arms but had maintained that the Hurds had obtained their arms elsewhere than in Turkey. 4. I asked Pakravan whether it was true that Peroughi had been told to go to Angora on his way back from Europe in the autumn to discuss the whole question. He replied that it was possible Peroughi might go but nothing had yet been settled. 5. His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz has since reported that near Hzil Dizeh on the Persian side of the frontier there is a small area which the Turks maintain should by right belong to them and that for the past few years they have been in the habit of invading this stretch of land during the harvest season and carrying off the crops which are the property of the Persian village owners while leaving to the peasants the share which belonged to them. This may refer to Serosatik the place mentioned by Pakravan in my despatch under reference. 6. It is quite clear however that no serious situation has yet arisen and that Teymourtache deliberately exaggerated the state of affairs to me three weeks^ago.

WI1H reference to my telegram No. 121 of the 25th June and to your telegram No 89 of the L2th July on the subject of the present Turco-Persian frontier troubles, I have the honour to submit the following observations : — 2. Shortly after my conversation with the Minister of the Court on the 25th June, a brief but very violent and abusive press campaign started against the Turks, accusing them of having ambitions on Persian territory. I telegraphed accordingly to 1 lis Majesty’s consul at Tabriz and requested him to try and ascertain and to report the actual facts. Mr. Gilliat-Smith replied on the 5th July that Turkish troops had crossed the frontier near Bazurgah towards the end of May ostensibly in pursuit of rebel Kurds. The Persian authorities protested and the Turkish troops were withdrawn. Two days later I saw the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and asked him what the present position was, and whether the Persian Government had based the protest, which I understood they had made, on the 1913 protocol. Pakraven confirmed that the Persian Government had protested, but said the protest had not been based on the protocol. He added that a place called Sirosatik, south-west of Lake Urumia, had been occupied by the Turks. What the Persian Government particularly objected to was the presence of armed bands of Turkish Kurds who continued to violate the frontier in spite of the assurances of the Turkish Government that the Kurds had all been disarmed. 3. A few days ago the French military attache asked M&amp;jor Fraser what all the trouble was about. The French consul at Tabriz, who was usually well-informed, had reported that the position on the frontier was not exceptional. It seems evident therefore that Teymourtache deliberately exaggerated the state of affairs to me for some reason which is not clear. 4. Yesterday Major Fraser discussed the matter with the chief of the General Staff. General Shaibani said that the real trouble was that the Turks refused to recognise the boundary defined in 1913, and yet I have the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs’ categorical statement that the protest made to the Turkish Government was not based on the 1913 protocol. 5. From a secret and reliable source I have reason to know that the Turkish Ambassador has been in discussion with Teymourtache on this question of the frontier, and it may be that the Persian Government are endeavouring to negotiate with the Turks a special frontier agreement outside the 1913 protocol which both parties would then denounce as void. In furtherance of this scheme—supposing my supposition is correct—Teymourtache first endeavoured to induce His Majesty’s Government to protest to the Turkish Government against this breach of the protocol and then let loose the press—the most offensive article was in the semi-Government organ the “ Tran '’—in order to stir the Turk into activity and bring him to the point of negotiating a new agreement. b I nv ill endeavour to ascertain more about what seems to me a rather mysterious manoeuvre, and shall of course lie most guarded in any future conversations I may have on the subject with Teymourtache.

[E 3262/2822/34] Sir R. Clive to Sir Austen Chamberlain.—{Received July 25.) (No. 320.) Sir, Gulhek, June 29, 1927. AS I had the honour to report in my telegram No. 121 of the 25th June, I had a long conversation that day with the Minister of the Court. I purposely had not hurried to act on the authority given me in your telegram No. 75 of the 9th June to pump his Excellency as to what he meant by an ‘ ‘ exchange of views, ” as I thought it was better not to appear too eager. 2. As I stated in my telegram No. 110 of the 5th June, my impression had been that Teymourtache wished to discuss the position that might conceivably arise in the event of Anglo-Soviet hostilities; I still believe that on the 3rd June, the date of our conversation, he had that in mind. In the past three weeks, however, the Shah's anxiety on that score has abated, and I have reason to believe that the Soviet Ambassador has stated most clearly that the last thing that the Russians desire is war with England. 3. The question raised at my interview by Teymourtache was quite unexpected. I had heard rumours of slight trouble on the Turco-Persian frontier with Kurdish bands, but that is nothing unusual. I was unaware that the Turks had, as Teymourtache alleged, deliberately advanced their frontier posts in two or three places to the old line, and were actually encouraging Turkish Kurds, whom they professed to have disarmed, to make raids into Persia. When I asked Teymourtache whether the Turkish Government had officially stated that they did not intend to abide by the 1913 protocol, he said that they had done so on several occasions. The Persian Government wished to know, therefore, he added, whether Great Britain as a signatory of that protocol, were prepared to support the view which, in reply to his question t confirmed that they held, that the findings of the Frontier Commission were valid and final and not a matter for discussion. In other words, his Excellency's question could only mean : “ Were His Majesty's Government prepared to approach the Turkish Government with a view to enforcing the decisions of the Frontier Commission?” It seems clear that what the Minister of the Court had in mind was that if His Majesty’s Government were not prepared to do this, the Persian Government would be free to ignore the decisions of the commission in the so-called Transferred Territory along the Iraq frontier; he did not, however, say so. 4. The question is complicated, as I pointed out to Teymourtache, by the fact that the Russian Government, which in 1913 had authorised their Ambassador at Constantinople to sign the protocol, had been replaced by the Soviet Government, with whom His Majesty’s Government at the present moment had no relations. His Excellency pressed me to enquire your views and to let him know as soon as possible what you thought. If, he added, we cannot count on the support of Great Britain in this matter, we shall be forced to turn to the Soviet Government. As I said in my telegram, I had the impression that this remark was in the nature of a bluff, for I don’t suppose for a moment that the Persian Government could count on any support from the Soviet Government against the Turks in this matter, nnd, although no doubt the Persian Ministers may have argued amongst themselves that if Turkey refused to abide by the protocol, Persia's hands would be free, yet they know perfectly well that in the last resort the Iraq Government would almost certainly refuse to restore to Persia the transferred territories. I am forwarding copies of this despatch to the Government of India and His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq, Bagdad. I have, &amp;c. R. H. CLIVE. P.S. June 30.—Since writing the above 1 have seen the Prime Minister, who confirmed what Teymourtache said. He told me that the Turks argued that the decisions of the Frontier Commission had no validity, as they had neither been ratified by the Sultan and the Turkish Parliament nor by the Majlis. 1 pointed out to [184 bb—11]Mukhber-es-Sultaneh that this argument was groundless, as it was laid down in the protocol that the decisions of the Frontier Commission would be immediately put into force, and there was no question of ratification. A His Highness shrugged his shoulders. He is an old gentleman of wide experience, \ who knows the Turks. Among many other posts he has held that of Governor of Azerbaijan. R. H.

From Sir R.Clive T s Despatch bf 4th June and the connected telegrams of 25th June from, and 12th July to, Teheran, it will he seen that the immediate effect of the Anglo-Soviet rupture was to stimulate the Shah to seek, through Taimourtache, an 'exchange of views”, the object of which would probably have been, as suggested in paragraph 5 of Sir R.Clive’s Despatch, the conclusion of some understanding wMch would safeguard Persia from being involved as a battleground in the event of hostilities between the Soviet and TT is hajesty’s Government. By the end of June the air had cleared in this quarter; confidence in the unlikelihood of trouble had been restored, and the centre of Persian interest had shifted to the Turkish frontier. Sir R.Clive’s telegram of 25th June read with Foreign Office reply of 12th July shows Taimourtache as an ling (wit' the bait of appeal to Russia) for British support which could be used as a pawn in the game over the Kurds with Turkey which , as will he seen from Sir George Clerk's Despatch of July 3th, is little satisfied with Persia on this point. The Forei pa Office, however, have refused to allow themselves to be entanr-led and are preau.i ec call ..he Persian bluff of invokin' the aid of the Soviet. The last sentence of their tele; ram of 12th July is particularly to the point. Vossuic-ed-dowleh's interview with, the Oriental Secretary is of distinct interest. There is little question/J ..Question that the inferences dra^n fxp.);uit..hy Sir F;.Clive are correct; that the Shah so lony as he can will endeavour to continue to hold his inner lines, and to pla}r off H.'hG-. and the Soviet against one another -in the same way as- he plays off the Majliss against successive Cabinets, the. American advisers, the Soviet and the Legation, against the Majliss; and. td t in the meanwhile we can hope for little satisfaction over outstanding questions save as a counterblast to tl e Soviet, or because we are in a position to frighten H.:i. , &lt; t or no bring very definite pressure - financial or ' other - jO bear upon him.

In the course of a long conversation today Minister of Court made clear what he now meant hy 'exchange of views* Persian government are much easier in their minds regarding the danger of Anglo-Russian hostilities. He said the Shah was much exercised hy present attitude of Turkey and Turkish government had (? gp.omt.) Persian government clearly to understand that they were not going to he hound hy 1913 protocol; they had conse quently advanced their frontier posts in several places to old line and were encouraging Kurdish raiding parties. It was to guard against this very danger that Persia had last year made neutrality agreement with Turkey. He asked my views of Turkish policy. I said I had no knowledge of Turkey; my impression was however that Turkish relations with all European pov/ers including Italy had much improved, that her friendship with Russia was unnatural, and that her present orientation was Asiatic. Minister said that this entirely agreed with Persian view. Persian government feared this Asiatic orientation which was direct danger to Persia. He then asked what was the viev; of His Majesty’s Government who were signatories of 1913 protocol towards validity of decisions of frontier commission* I replied/replied that decisions of the force in accordance with the unquestioned. His Majesty's commission had been put in protocol and have remained Government did not therefor e consider the matter was one for discussion. Minister then enquired whether Kis Majesty's Govern- ment would be prepared to support this view. I said I could not answer the question. World conditions had changed. 'he Russian government which had authorised Russicn ambassador at Constantinople to sign protocol in 1913 was now replaced by Soviet government with whom we had no relations. He begged me to enquire and at the same time oo treat the matter as very confidential. Finally he added almost as an after-thought that if Persia coula not count upon the support of His Majesty's.. Government she would be forced to turn to Russia in self- deiencc. I consider this last remark to have been in the nature of a bluff. in any case I ignored it. Addressed to Foreign Office No. 121, repeated to Government of India No. 48.^ COPY (H 3044/2822/34) No.352. (1961/108/1927) &lt; r TK!5HAPIA July 6th, 1927. I I have read in the printed telegram sections Sir R. Clive’s telegram No.121 of June 25th last, reporting a statement of the Minister of Court that the Turkish Government was not going to he hound hy the 1913 Protocol, had advanced certain frontier posts, and was encouraging Kurdish raids.. 2. I am at present unahle to confirm this reported intention of the Turkish Government, hut, from what I know of the atmosphere of Angora, I derive the following impression. 3. The Turkish Government, while fairly satisfied with the Kurdish policy of Irak and with the Syrian frontier authorities, is distinctly dissatisfied with the Kurdish policy of Persia. The Turkish Government itself still hopes to deal with its own Kurds hy whole sale repression or expulsion or both. But the present attitude of Persia makes such a policy difficult. 4. It may therefore he that the Turkish Government is quietly trying to stir up such trouble among the Persian Kurds across the border as would make the Persian Government glad to join in a common policy of repression. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and to His Majesty's High Commissioner at Bagdad. I I have, etc., (Sd.) George R.

C^her telsgraiii to Sir R. Clive (Tehran). Foreign Office. 12th July, 1927. 5.00 p.m. No. 89. Your telegram No. 121 (of June 25th: Persian relations v;ith Turkey and Russia). His Majesty^ Government have no reason to conceal their view that the Gecivsions of the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission and protocol of 1S13 are unquestion ably valid, but this does not mean that they are pre pared to intervene in any Turco-Persian dispute on the subject. You should therefore make it clear to the Persian government, if they return to the question, that His Majesty’s Government regard the present dispute as a matter purely for settlement between Persia and Turkey, and in these circumstances they feel that no useful purpose would be served by any public pronouncement of their views, unless requested by both parties to the dispute. Confidential. I realize that, in face of this explanation, the Persian government may reiterate their threat to look to Russia for support, but much as I should regret such a development, I think we must take the risk. For • • •I am not inipreseed by the I have not observed much For your guidance• 'threat to rely on Russia, evidence in recent Persian policy of a sincere desire to cultivate friendship with His Majesty’s Government. The Persian government are more ready to ask our aid than to perform their ororr-ises or discharge their obligations to us. (Cf.
