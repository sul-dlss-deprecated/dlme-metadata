Dear Mr* Weight, Thank yon for your latter Wo* BS/0701/2 of Wcrenber 30 anelosing a report an your rlalt to the schools in Kuwait* 2« I took the opportunity of a recent call on a prominent member of the Education Committee (who has two sons at Victoria College, Alexandria) to bring up the question of education in Kuweit* I referred to the political testament of Zaghlul Pasha • using schoolboys for political purposes • and mentioned Iraq and the 8 nlt«Jewish riots in Bahrein that had begun in a schoolboy demonstration* I told him of current practice in Egyptian universities where students strike after admission, strike when they are not allowed to sit their examinations and strike again when their diplomas are withheld - all because of non-payment of fees. 3* I was assured that the bad example of Egyptian education was not lost on Kuweit* The Egyptians wished Kuweit to send their students to Egypt for secondary and university education but the Kuweiti authorities had determined to send no more boys to the Kuweiti hostel in Cairo but to raise standards in Kuweiti education to matriculation itandawd level and then to send students straight to university in the United Kingdom. The point of having English taught by English teachers was fully appreciated and I think it only a question of time before this target is achieved* As with 4* As with everything else in Kuweit, however, we cannot force the pace nor do I consider it desirable that we should attempt to do so* The remarkable changes of the last two or three years have ^ given Kuweit an enormous meal to swallow but I see no reason to doubt that tte the exercise of sympathy and patience we shall find that the local digestion is in good working order. The essentials are therei Egyptian education is discredited, no more students are to be sent to the Kuweiti Hostel in Cairo and local standards are to be brought up to matriculation level. 5* One small point calls for comment• I imagine that Victoria College, Alexandria would not welcome a very large contingent of boys from Kuweit and so I suggested that parents who wished to send their boys to this type of school should use Victoria College, Cairo. I was told that Victoria College, W.H*Keight, Esq*, British Council, Basra*Cairo did not look after boys so well as Victoria College, Alexandria. I do not suggest that there is any foundation to this statement but pass it on as an example of the wague sort of prejudicial report than gains circulation. There is also some support here for the riew widely held elsewhere that it would be better if Victoria ttwCollege, Cairo were to call itself by some other nane. 5 . I a* sending a copy of this letter to the Represents tire of the British Council in Iraq, to the Political Resident in the Persian and to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
