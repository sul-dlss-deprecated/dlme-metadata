Balmain. Memorandum: - This may be of interest to you. On Thursday 29th October, 1942, His Highness visited this office and sent for the Director of Customs, Khan Bahadur Abdulaziz al Kozaibi, Khalil Kanoo and Mansoor al Arayedh and held a discussion about the rationing system, profits to merchants and smuggling of food supplies out of Bahrain. He stated that in future importers under the quota would not be allowed more than 5$ profit but merchants who imported goods over and above the quota would be allowed 10 c / o profit. He gave a severe warning about smuggling goods out of Bahrain especially from certain villages on the coast. He stated that the export of donkeys was entirely forbidden, as very soon they would be needed to replace motor transport. He ordered the Director of Customs to allow Persian importers of cattle etc. to export goods up to the value of half their imports, instead of only £ of the value of imports. He then discussed adjusting prices of rice with a view to increase the market cost of the better kinds, used mainly in wealthy houses and reducing the cost of the inferior brands. No definite decision however was made on this subject. He also discussed various points connected with rationing; systems and means of preventing abuses of the present method.

C(t4l^ Dear Sir, i , i beg to inform you that I am a Lemonade and Sodawater manufacturer and have established my business here in Bahrain since the past twenty-two years. Due to shortage in certain materials, my business has slowed down to a certain extent, but of late I find great difficulties in obtaining sugar from the Control Department. Up to the end of last month, Rajab, I was getting my requirements of sugar of one bag per week, but since three months they refuse to give me anything. I supply the Army in Bahrain through their contractors and if I stop my factory from working, it means I have to give up my business and I will have no other means of existence. Any small coffee shop that springs up in the town is allowed sugar but I, who have done business here for so long, am not al3owed any and whn I appeal to the Customs Control Clerk, he tells me w To gr and close your shop I request that this matter should be looked into and I will be very grateful if you will instruct the Controllers Office to give me a permit to obtain my requirements of sugar.

The Director of Customs &amp; Port Office, Bahrain. Memorandun . His Highness Shaikh sulman this morning discussed vrarious matters connected with food control with Shaikh Abdulla and myself. He decided that as the present arrange ments which exist in hoharraq are working well to the satisfaction of the public it is advisable to ascertain whether the same method of dealing with rationing cannot bo adopted in Manama, i.e. that the Manama Biladya should take over frori the Customs Department the work of issuing ration cards to He public in Manama. The Manama Munici pality has already had soma experience in th&amp;s work as for cone months they have dealt v/ith the sugar ration. His Highness wishes ue to instruct 'ou to hand over the ration ing of rico, wrhe it and flour to tne Manama Municipality from whatever date seems suitable. I suggest that the change should cone into fores from next Saturday. This will mean that the ration clerris will vacate their present office and the Municipality wil make arrangements for their accomodation and for the public, at the Municipal building. His Highness regards this change somewhat as an experiment but he hopes that it will work successfully. It will be necessary to inform the public by notice, broadcast and in the local paper that from Saturday they will have to attend at the Municipal building when applying for ration cards. His Highness is particularly anxious that the Food Committee should continue to function as this body is of use in keeping the authorities in touch with the views of the public on food matters and not all of the members are members of tha two municipal councils. I should be obliged if you would arrange with the Secretary of the Manama Municipality details of the transfer of the rationing staff, it mav be possible to reduce the number of young clerks who are now employed on the work.

They pointed out that sweet drinks are little used except in summer and the shops seem to be able to obtain enough sugar to use in the tea which they sell without extra rations. The Committee considered that if people wish to buy sweet drinks or cakes etc. they can provide the sugar from their own ration. Adviser to the Government.lat, CUSTOM rlUUSlL, flQ.PA/li/ FC /446/6-L.

Bahrain Memorandum:- |? • With reference to the enclosed petition from Persian Nakhudas, the position is as follows 2. Importers of cattle etc. by native craft from Persian ports are allowed to export from Bahrain goods equal in value to half of the value of their imports. They are not however allowed to take from Bahrain commodities such as flour*, grain, sugar and rice of which no reser/e supply is held in the State. They are allowed to export tea, coffee, pepper etc. from the quantity now in the bazaar which is surplus to tne six months* supply which is bcin^ kept in Bahrain. Local merchants holding stocks of these commodities are permitted to export a proportion Ox their stock but it does not follow that the owners of the goods will be willing to sell them to Pesian Nakhudas. 3. In addition each man of the crew is allowed to draw 15 days rations of controlled foodstuffs including sugar, rice etc. which is supposed to provide him with food on the return trip, in fact this allowance is usually in excess of the amount needed to ieed the crew between Bahrain and the Persian coast but it was recommended by the Pood Committee and approved by His Highness with the intention of encouraging the Persian trade. 4. We do not set out to provide supplies from Bahrain for wives and families of Persian traders who live in Persia. 2/1 - 2 - 5. passengers who travel from Bahrain and who are normally resident in Bahrain should draw their rations in Bahrain on their ration cards before leaving. 6. There is not at present any arrangement for visiting Persian Nakhudas and their crew to draw rations of rice, flour and sugar during the time they are waiting in Bahrain. To allow them to draw a months* supply, like other residents, would enable them to stay here for two or three days and to carry away one months* supply of food which is needed here. I am referring this point to the Food Committee on Tuesday for discussion. Adviser to the Government. Bncl, S.Z.ir-r/- ^ Q O Translation of petition dated 24th November 1942 from the undermentioned persons to the Political Agent, Bahrain. It is not hidden from your Justice that we have been bringing from Persia to Bahrain many kinds of articles, cattle, fowls etc. The just (Bahrain) Government has decided and allowed us to export some pieces of cloths only from Bahrain for Persxa to state that all of us have families and children. Every boat contains a crew of more or less 30 persons besides the passengers, who travel with us, so we all require provisions for the sea journey and during the time of our stay in Bahrain. «/e request you to issue orders for us to be allowed to take some provisions, so that we may not be prevented by the Customs official. We are dependent on God and the High British Government and we are under her protection. Her Justice and benevolence are enjoyed by the far, the near, the &amp;igh and the low. We pray God for your existence for many years to come. We also inform you that we have been delayed here for more than two months and now we have nothing to maintain ourselves. 1.

Reference to previous correspondence Food Supplies. mi.I have the honour to inform Tour Highness that on Monday last the Political Agent held a meeting at which I and the Director cf Customs were present to discuss the question of food supplies. The following were among the points which were raised* 1 • Trade by P ers ian c raft who imp ort an innIs for meat, char coal, wood etc * At present these persons are allowed to export goods, except food, to the value of half of their imports. The demand for meat has much increased in Bahrain owing to the presence of British troops and there is a shortage of charcoal. It was suggested that these importers should be allowed to export an amount of goods equal to the total amount of their imports of foodstuffs and of wood and charcoal including foodstuffs which are not rationo^t. In Dubai this commerce is flourishing % and there are more imports because there are no restrictions on exports. 2. Existing stocks of foodstuffs . As Your Highness is aware, v*e hold big stocks of tea, coffee, copper, carda- V •&gt; , , 4 r . ’ • v ; • v, .. ' - mom and turmeric in Bahrain which are sufi'icient ^for about a year. Our suock of tea is sufficient for over a year. Your Highness did not approve of allowing any of these^ stocks to be exported because in Your Highness's opinion the prices would probably increase. The merchants who own these goods are now unable to turn over their money because they can only sell a small ^ipantity evary month; this acts as a brake on trade. Some of these commodities such as tea and coffee were bought some time a o and if they are kept too long they will deteriorate. There is no reason for assuming that when the time comes for the new crops that the price will be highar than at present. If tea and coffee are in the future to be included in the quota we shall be allowed a certain -quantity-- 2 - quantity every month from India. It was suggested that a supply sufficient for eight months should be kept in Bahrain end that permission should be given to export the balance. If this is done the eight months supply shoula be bought fgom the merchants who now hold it by the Bahrain Government- so as to allow the merchants to trade freely with the money winch is now tied up in tea, coffee etc. 3. Regarding motor tyros arm spare parts* tne 'Political India for some tyres etc. for Bahrain.'• 4 r It is the. opinion of the Political iAgent, v/hich I share, that the chief reason why Bahrain trade has shifted to Dubai is because there are so many restrictions on they naturally ao not import goods; esp'ecirally those foodstuffs such as tea of which a large supply s held in Bahrain. 5. T should be grateful if Your Highness would consider trie various points rai^^lln this memorandum. The Political Ageirt dnslred W’‘trD^ inform Your Highnes^ that he would be pleased to discuss these various noints should Your Highness desire to do so. I think I shouL point out to Your Highness that there is a good deal o: commercial jealousy among the merchants and those persi who do not possss stocks of tea, coffee etc. will not Agent has requested me to write again to him pointing out the importance of keeping cars especially public vehicles nodes ary for carrying labourers to work on the roads and he has assured me triat Tie w.ill do all that is possible’to secure permission from the Government of '^y '-X nA they are not free to export many commodities from Bahrain be pleased to see the owners of these commodities bain; given permission to export some of the goods# Adviser.

B. M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum: - Reference your memorandum 4th January, 1943. No.C/6 dated the I enclose a note on the rationing system in Bahrain. Adviser to the Government. Sncl2/— 3 RATIONING SYSTEM IN BAHRAIN. The rationing system is based upon:- (1) The population as determined by the 1941 Census. (2) The amount of foodstuffs imported into Bahrain from India under the export quotas. (3) The normal diet of the people which differs in certain communities, i.e. tea is scarcely used in the Shia villages, so little sugar is needed whereas in Manama and Moharraq tea is used as much as or more than coffee. 2. At present the following foodstuffs are rationed:- rice, sugar, wheat and flour. 3. Price control but not rationing is exercised over most other essential goods and commodities such as dates, firewood, meat, certain piece goods, eggs, matches, char coal, etc. etc., but these goods are not rationed. 4. System in the towns of Manama, Moharraq and Hedd . To carry out rationing and price control effectively it is essential that the controlling authority should know the quantities of controlled goods which are in the bazaars. For this purpose all merchants and shopkeepers are required to furnish a weekly return shewing their stocks in hand of essential commodities on the enclosed form (A). Failure to send in this return or incorrect statements on these returns lead to prosecuAtion in Court and punishment by fine. 5. A ration card (form B) is issued upon application to each householder. The card shows the number of residents in the house, one adult being equal to two children. At present one card is required to enable the householder to draw the sugar ration to which he is entitled and another2 to enable him to draw rice, flour and wheat. Where a rationing system was being newly augurated all the rationed commodities could be shown on one card. Rationing of sugar in Bahrain began before rationing of rice, flour etc. 6, At present the amounts per head of rationed food stuffs are:- Rice 12 lbs, Flour 4 lbs, Wheat 4 lbs Sugar 4 lbs. The proportion of flour and wheat depends upon existing supplies. Persons preferring a larger proportion of wheat and/or/flour have the option of drawing 8 lbs of wheat or flour and four lbs of rice. 7. When the householder has obtained his ration card he is given a sale order (Form C) on which is written the total quantity of rationed foodstuffs which he is entitled to purchase. When the system was first started the sale orders were made out in the name of one of the authorised shopkeepers and the card holder could buy only from this shop. It was found, later, that this method was unpopular and caused dealy and inconvenience to the public. Most people had running accounts with certain shops and were unwilling to transfer their business to another retailer. Now all sale orders can be used for purchases from any of the authorised shops. The seller is not specified on the sale order. The householder, having obtained his ration card and his sale order, visits one of the authorised shops and produces his card and sale order. He purchases either the full ration for the whole month or a part of it. If he buys the full amount to which he is entitled he surrenders his sale order to the shopkeeper, retaining his ration card. If he buys only a part of his ration the sale order is endorsed by the shopkeeper and handed back to 3/4 /™ the purchaser. The shopkeeper records the transaction in his ledger, Y/hen the purchaser finally completes the purchase of the authorised quantity he surrenders his sale order to the shopkeeper. It has been found by practice that nmnbQg^ of the public almost always buy the whole amount of rations to which they are entitled. It is a fact that in some cases if the ration holder does not require the full amount for himself he frequently buys the remainder which he does not require for somebody else; but private transactions such as these are inevitable and are not regarded as illegal. As an example of this many people hand over their flour ration to their bakers who supply them with a certain number of loaves daily and sell the loaves which they make with the surplus flour. 8. Authorised Sellers . The Food Controller assisted by a committee of local notables appoints every month authorised shops in the three towns which are allowed to sell rationed foodstuffs to the public, such shopkeepers having been established since 1st Moharram 1360. At present there are 45 shops in Manama, 27 in Moharraq and 7 in Hedd. If shopkeepers fail to conform with the food regulations they are struck off the list or suspended for a month. The shopkeepers purchase wholesale from the G-overnment reserve or from importers. In the beginning they are allowed a certain quantity of each commodity which is estimated according to their normal monthly sales. When they have almost exhausted their stock they notify the Food Controller the amount remaining and they send to him their sale orders which are checked against the quaatity of foodstuffs which was originally acquired by them. They are then allowedw- ** e to purchase new stock for another month. Retailers are allowed profit on sales of rationed foodstuffs^ Care being taken to ensure that only one kind of rice at one price is on sale at any one time. 9. Village System . About half of the population of Bahrain live in the villages on Manama and Moharraq islands and their n r-\ standard education is considerably lower than that in the three towns, the vast majority of village people ^ are illiterate. The villages are very insular and are self contained units. From tta administrative reasons the rationing of the whole village population and the system of cards etc was considered too difficult to undertake though should the food position deteriorate and require more stringent methods it may become necessary in future to apply the town system to the villages. At present authorised shopkeepers are appointed in every village. In most small villages there are only one or two shops and these are long established. By reference to the Census figures of each village the Food Committee decides the minimum quantity of rationed foodstuffs necessary for every village. This amount is divided among the authorised village shopkeepers who purchase monthly supplies from the Government reserve or from importers. They sell the food at the controlled price and they keep accounts of their sales but neither ration cards or sale orders are used. The fair working o^ this arrangement depends mainly upon the villagers themselves who in their own interests keep a keen eye on the activi ties of the local shopkeeper and who would certainly complain if n foreigners' from other villages did their shopping from the local shop. This system appears to be 5/5 working well and the only complaints against it have been made by Arabs in the towns who sometimes suggest that the Shia villagers are getting away with more than their share. In fact the consumption of certain food stuff, particularly sugar, is very much lower in the villages than in the towns and the food committee takes these facts into consideration when deciding upon the quantities which are to be made available for the villages. 10. Administration . When rationing was first introduced the work was carried out by the Director of Customs and Port Officer with a few temporary clerks to augment the Customs staff. As the work increased it became necessary to decentralise the administration. The Municipalities undertook the issue of ration cards and sale orders and a committee was set up to assist the Director of Customs and Port Officer in his capacity of Food Controller. The village system is still directed by the Food Controller assisted by a Sub-Committee from the Food Committee whose duty is to visit the village districts at frequent intervals to hear any complaints arising and propose adjustments of same and as long as it works satisfactorily it is advisable that the villages should not be dependent upon the town Municipal authorities who have little knowledge of and small sympathy with the Shia villagers. A staff of about 18 young clerks are now employed on rationing work with an inspector who visits the village shops. The control of prices and the decision as to the amount of authorised rations as well as all transactions for acquiring supplies by the Government and allocation of quotas is in the hands of the Government.

U Minutes of a meeting of the Food Committee held in the Manama Municipal Building on Tuesday the 12th January 1943, All the members of the Committee were present. His Excellency Shaikh Abdulla, who had previously had a discussion with His Highness Shaikh Salman on the subjects dealt with at the meeting, presided. The Adviser was present. Sugar . The sugar position was reviewed. At the existing rate of rationing it appeared that the supply in Bahrain k would last about ^months. The Committee was told that the Government was trying to get supplies of Indian sugar from Bombay but it was not certain whether or when sugar would arrive. The members of the Committee stated that the sugar ration was very generous, they suggested that sugar was being smuggled out of Bahrain. They said that sweets were being made in the bazaar from surplus sugar rations. The Director of Customs suggested that in the case of large households, exceeding three or four ration drawers, the quantity of sugar for each person should be reduced or a minimum quantity should be allowed for one household. It was proposed by Haj Khalil Kanoo and decided, unanimously, that there should be a general reduction of the sugar ration from 4 lbs to 2 lbs per month until it was known that regular supplies of sugar were coming from India. Rice, Flour and Wheat . The meeting discussed the restriction on the export of rice and grain etc., from India which was regarded as a matter likely to cause serious trouble in Bahrain. A 2 /A statement of existing stocks was read from which it appeared that according to present rationing rates the rice stock would last about 2-|- months and the flour and wheat about seven months . The Committee was informed that the Government hoped to obtain further supplies of wheat from Australia. It was decided that steps should be taken to reduce rice consumption by increasing the wheat or flour ration. The possibility of issuing flour to bakers was again discussed but the proposal was rejected. All present agreed that bakers were selling bread and it was always available in the bazaar. Samples of wheat loaves were produced. It was stated that the flour mill was working and in most houses stone mills were being used. One member said that normally less rice was eaten in the winter and more flour consumed so a reduction in rice ration for the time being would not come as hard as if it had been made in the summer. It was proposed and agreed that the rice ration should be reduced from 12 lbs to 8 lbs monthly and the flour and w wheat ration should be increased by 4 lbs. Dates . There was a long discussion about dates. All stated that persons holding stocks of dat4s were not selling because they hoped that the already high controlled price would be increased. Eventually it was decided that no action should be taken locally, it wculd be difficult to ration dates as no information was available showing the stocks in hand. The Committee believed that the arrival of the dates which are being imported from Kuwait would force the local date hoarders to put their stock into the market. Members suggested that dates were being 3/3 smuggled out of Bahrain to Q,attar. Haj Khalil Kanoo, on behalf of the Poor Relief Committee offered to lend 400 gallas of the Katif dates for sale in Moharraq on condition that a similar quantity was returned to the Committee. Moharraq members stated that Moharraq was worse off than Manama and both towns were worse off, as regards dates, than most of the country villages. The Sub Committee of the Food Committee reported on their recent tour of the villages on the west coast and described the deplorable condition of the people in certain villages where the inhabitants did not depend upon cultivation but upon diving and weaving. It was decided that the Poor Relief Committee should arrange assistance for this district at once. Other matters which were discussed were whether a shopkeeper with dates in his shop could legally refuse to sell them, whether the Police could be ordered to prevent dates being taken out of Manama and Moharraq and the question of weights of Bahrain and Katif dates. It was decided that it was illegal for a shopkeeper to refuse to sell goods shown in his shop for sale and that there was no legislation to prevent dates being conveyed from place to place in Bahrain.

Bahrain. Memorandum:- The following note on a meeting of the Food Control committee held at the Adviserate on 7/ednesday the 3rd February 1943, may be of interest to you. Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa presided, all members of the Food Control committee were present also the Adviser and Food Controller. In addition to food committee members the newly elected members of the Shia Wakf Council had been invited to attend, they consisted of about 15 leading men each representing groups of Shia villages in all parts of Bahrain. The meeting began at 10 A.M. and ended at 1.45 P.M. Shaikh Abdulla left at 11.45. Bis Highness Shaikh Salman put in an appearance and addressed the meeting emphasising the desirability for co-operation between the public and his Government and the need for ensuring that the people of the villages should be able to purchase their food require ments at controlled prices. He also said that the new method which was to be discussed became necessary because town and village shopkeepers had been cheating the public and profit ing at the expense of the poor. He warned the meeting that persons found smuggling food out of Bahrain would be dealt with severly and stated that his country depended on help from the British Government for obtaining essential food supplies.V-- 2 1*0 After His Highness had spoken Haj Khalil Ebrahim al Moayad referred to the question of dates and pointed out that if the G-overnraent had ascertained the amount of the Bahrain date crop and controlled prices of dates from the beginning of the season landowners would not have been able to hoard and profiteer. He urged His Highness to introduce legislation to control date prices before the next harvest. His Highness said that the Bahrain crop was only a small proportion of the quantity annually consumed in Bahrain. The meeting spent a long time in considering and discussing a new system of supplying villages with rationed foodstuffs. It was unanimously agreed that the only way to ensure proper distribution and sale of supplies was for the Government to control village shops. Manama island was divided into a number of districts to have one shop in the central village of the district. Villages close to Manama were incorporated into Manama and all villages in Moharraq island to be supplied from Moharraq town. In certain places where Government schools or Police Posts existed shops were to be opened and their activities supervised by Police or by school headmasters. In some other villages men of substance and standing were proposed as being fit to sell food to the nublic provided that they put forward /acceptable persons to guarantee them. It was agreed that shops should be supplied directly by the Government and there should be no purchasing from town shopkeepers. Most of the members spoke strongly about the dishonest practices between town and village shopkeepers. Letters were drafted to a number of leading men in the Suk al Khamis and Jedhafs districts calling on them to submit lists of householders who had not already received ration cards; when the lists were checked by Census returns,4/— 3 cards would be issued from the Manama and Moharraq Municipalities to enable people to buy rationed food from Government shops in the country. Various proclama tions and notices were discussed. It was decided that the first Government shop would be opened at 3uk al Khamis on Saturday and would commence selling to ration card holders of those villages in the Suk al Khamis district. After the Shia Wakf members had left the Food Control committee discussed rationing of tea and coffee. Members pointed out that certain communities used tea and others coffee and some used both. There was a long discussion about the quantity required per head. Haj Khalil Fbrahim Kanoo suggested that the ration should be 8 oz per month of coffee and 5 oz per month of tea and that these commo dities should only be purchased by persons presenting a coupon to the seller, the coupons to be obtained from the Food Control authorities. The amount of tea and coffee bought should be entered on the back of the purchaser’s ration card. Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa was not present during this discussion but on the following day he intimated his wish for reconsideration of the matter at the next meeting. Some members of the committee urged the need to ration matches but this suggestion was not approved as the Govern ment had no knowledge of the quantity of matches in the bazaar. The committee understood that because retailers were holding back their stocks of tea, coffee and matches and selling these in black market at high prices the man in the street was now having great difficulty in buying any of these a_ goods. All members agreed, quoting specific cases that trf- fic in rations was going on and many people who could not afford or did not require their full rations were selling a4 a large proportion at considerable profit especially to bakers, sweet makers and coffee shop proprietors.

It was decided that the price of yarn, imported from India, which is sold by local shop keepers to the village weavers should be controlled. Prices should be examined. The price of yarn in India was said to have increased by 75% during the last year. Village Rationing . It was pointed out to the meeting that actual ration cards issued in villages showed an increase of about 10^ over the population figures of the census whereas in Manama and Moharraq the difference was very slight. It was also found that the number of persons entitled to rations in villages exceeded the number which was obtained from census figures by about 20%. This was partly explained by the fact that children under 12 years old are given half the ration of an adult and in the census a very large number of young people were described as minors, when in fact they were over 12 years old, because it was feared that they might be conscripted for military service. The committee decided that village centres should be given supplies according to the number of ration card holders purchasing from the centre not according to census figures, which had been the basis for assessing supplies in the past.2 3. Members asked that copies of all Ahlans and Customs notices relating to Food Control should be sent to them. This was agreed. 4. After a very long discussion it was decided that steps must be taken to deal with the tea and coffee position which has rapidly deteriorated. It was decided to ration tea and coffee at the rate of 2 oz. of tea per head per month and 4 lbs. of coffee per head per month. The coffee ration would be universal and tea ration only to apply in Manama, Moharraq, Hedd and Rafaa. Five boxes of tea monthly would be allocated to the villages as consumption in villages was small. It vas thought that this arrangement would tend to prevent black market trading. This was to be done as an experiment. 5. piece Goods . The members agreed that at present the public cannot buy cotton piece goods except by paying more than the cont rolled price as merchants were hoarding material and selling them at 100% profit to persons not previously engaged in the piece goods trade. One member suggested that the Government and Municipalities should purchase all available cheap cotton piece goods and should sell them to the public in Government shops. Rationing of piece goods was also suggested but it was finally agreed that a small quantity should be bought by Government and given to authorised shopkeepers for sale by the yard not by the handle.

All members, with the exception of Sheikh Ebrahim bin Lohamed bin Issa A1 I ha1ifah, were present* ^he meeting opened with a discussion over a complaint against Sayeo Ha shim Sayed J iohamed, a shopkeeper at Toobli. It is alleged that Sayed Hashim has been short selling wheat, although his books show correct issues. After 'various suggestions had been put forv/ard by members, it was unanimously agreed to request Sayed Ha shim and the 18 signa cci ies to ^ne complaint to attend the next meeting, when lurther investigations will be undertaken. There followed a discussion in regard to the villages of Jao, Askar and Dur, from which villages the majority of in habitants leave for the summer and proceed to destinations such as Sitrah, Esse:: Point etc. In order to assist in che correct allocation of supplies a letter has been addressed to responsible persons in each of the three above mentioned places, requesting that the Food Controller be kept advised of the number of departures and their new destinations. The next matter to come before the meeting was the question of opening a Government shop at Hedd© Hajy Khalil I anoo was of the opinion it would be necessary to have at least two Government shops in view of the size of population, but after somewhat lengthy discussion it was however deciaed to open one suitable and large enough Government shop to meet all requirements. Hajy Mohsin Tajir then raised the question of the supply of coffee to the villages, pointing out that from available records more coffee is consumed in the villages than in Manama. After a lengthy discussion and in view of the X* present stocks coupled v/ith^assured monthly quota for Bahrain,it v/as unanimously agreed to allow the villages the same ration as the towns ie. 8 ozs per head per month; Lr. Mohamed Saleh then brought to the notice of the meeting a case where a person living in I anama was able to purchase rationed goods at Sukalhhamis; the inference being that certain persons not requiring their rations are selling same. In an endeavour to combat this practise a notice is being circulated to all authorized shopkeepers to the effect that sales against ration cards are only to be made in the locality for which they are issued. Lr. Kalil A1 Moyad then asked if it would not be possible to arrange for the poor people in Lanama to obtain daily rations as there were many unable to afford to buy large quantities at one time, and in this connection the Food Controller has instructed the Secretary of the lanama Baladeyh to allocate five shops from i the number authorised for the purpose of selling on the daily basis only. The meeting ended at 12.l5.p.m.At the request of a number of Direct Importers as per copy^ attached, a meeting was held at the Custom House between their representation and the Food Controller, at 10.30 a.m. on Saturday May 1st 194-3 • The Direct Importers were represented by:- Abdulaziz al Bassam. Sulenan Bassam. Mr. Abuul Latif. lusuf Ali Akbar Ali Reza. Yusuf MaiULdi. Abdulla al Zamal. . Mr. Abdulla al Gasibi. Haridas Janimal. Ratanchand Dipchand &amp; Co., H. Adam. D. Hemandas. Goverdhandas Dharamdas. The Direct Importers made a request that the undernoted foodstuffs which are being imported by the Bahrain Government ie: Rice, Sugar, Wheat and Wheat Flour, should, on arrival, be distributed amongst them for sale to retailers. As by soloing, this would only increase retail prices it was regretted that their request cannot be recommended. With regard to the- monthly quota of Tea and Coffee for Bahrain ie: 20 tons Tea and 32 tons Coffee monthly as from 1st April 194-3, the Direct Importers were informed that the Govern ment were agreeable to their purchasing and shipping these commodities to Bahrain for sale to consumers, at landed cost plus % margin of profit only:- To this offer the Direct Importers agreed and the above amounts have been distributed as per attached list for April only. May quotas will be distributed to further importers, a copy of which will be sent you in due course. The merchants then requested, that for those goods which they cohld freely import, they should be allowed to re-export 50 $, retaining 50 /^ for local consumption. On enquiry into this matter further, particularly as to what goods they referred to: they revealed they were in a position to import: Coffee from Aden, Jagari from Karachi (unrefined sugar) Ground nuts. Til seeds. spices- xamarind- Black Pepper Vegetable Oils and Charcoal. After a discussion it was tentatively agreed that in the event of the merchants importing the above freely and in sufficient quantiities 60 /j should remain in Bahrain for local consumption at controlled prices, and 40^ be allowed for re-export, the export to be subject to existing stocks of the particular commodity at the time of applying for a Customs Shipping Bill. The merchants agreed to the above.- 2 - With regard to the question of a higher margin of profit being allowed on goods arriving by country craft, as this traffic will to a large extent be non-existent during the monsoon, this matter was left in abeyance, it should however be borne in mind as there is a greater risk and time lag between ordering, ship ping and arrival of goods by country craft as opposed to goods arriving by steamer, as well as the greater risk of damage &lt;tnz&gt; pilferage of cargoes. In order to encourage the import of non quota foodstuffs by this method it might be advisable to allow an extra 5% margin of profit.Copy. Dated 2?th April, 1943. Bahrain The Pood Controller, Bahrain* Sir, At a meeting of merchants (direct importers) interested in the trade of foodstuffs in consideration of the present state of business which has brought our trade to a standstill, after a careful consideration it was decided to bring the following for your favourable consideration*- 1. i'he quota goods ie the goods which are imported by Government may, on arrival, be distributed among the direct importers who in return may sell on a margin of profit to be sanctioned and in accordance with your instructions* 2* Non quota goods le goods which merchants can freely import on their own initiative 50 J&amp; nay Be permitted for export and 50 ^ for local consumption under the prevailing control system* That export may be sanctioned to direct importers only* • 3# That shipping bills for permission for export from local cargo may be cleared within a week from the date of lodgment and the applicants may be informed of the result of their shipping H.B.M ’s Political Agent's notification. 5* The margin of profit for cargo of country craft should be higher than that of the steamer in consideration of risk, detention, and damaged to contents and its insurance obstacles and difficulties involved to the importer. With an earnest desire that a sympathetic consideration will be given whereby our trade may be rerevived* Further we shall be able to place all our contentions in support thereof whenever interview is granted to us* bills.

B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum: - While arranging the village rationing system and country supply centres some figures have come to light which show a certain discrepancy between the census returns and the actual figures according to rationed persons. In the case of 10 village centres, embrac&lt;*ft$ about 75 villages it has been found that the nett increase over census figures is 569 persons in a population of 28,680. This seems to prove that the census, in the case of the villages, was remarkable accurate. There is however a very large difference in the proportion of adults and infants. In the census there was shown in these same villages 17,194'adults and 10,917 infants. The ration cards now show 28,298 adults and only 382 infants, which is obviously absurd. During the census many adults were put down as minors, because there was an idea that they were needed for military service. Now, as a child under 12 is only entitled to half a ration many such children are being described as adults. ^ A Adviser to the Government. S.ZA meeting of the Food Control Committee was held at the ^o) Custom Jouse, at 10 a.m. on Wednesday the 26 th l ay 194-3? over which His Excellency Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa A1 Khalifah presided. All members, with the exception of Hajy Mahmood Abdul Nabi, were present. In accordance with the decision of the members at the meeting held on the 2oth ultimo, the first item on the agenda was the case of Sayed-Hashim Sayed Hohamed, a shopkeeper at Toobli, against the 18 signatories to the complaint against him of short selling wheat. Both Sayed Ha shim and the 18 signatories were requested by letter from the Food Controller to attend to-day’s meeting, but as the 18 signatories did no t attend, the matter was dropped 0 The next item to be discussed was the receipt by the Food Controller, of a petition from the Jewish Community of Bahrain, to the effect that as they have been and are still experiencing difficulties in obtaining their rations from the authorised shop keepers they should be allowed to open up a shop of their own for the sale of^rationed foodstuffs. They suggested the appointment of ^,r. Shaul , eir David Rouben as their sales representative. The meeting regretted they could not accede to their request, as it was felt that by doing so, this would create a precedent- and would possibly result in complications such as- the Hindu Community etc,etc all wishing to open their own shops. At a decision taken later in the meeting the difficulties the Jewish Community allege they experience, should now be put right. The meeting then discussed several signed complaints against Ibrahim bin Salim, Government Shopkeeper at Raffa. The principle so called offence appeared to be the Government shopkeeper's refusal to sell rations to a person presenting the ration cards of several others. After a discussion it was decided to send a sub committee to investigate the complaints and report on them in due course. The Food Controller then proposed that as there were now 36,318 full rations issued monthly in Hanamah, these should be divided equally and distributed identically among the authorised shopkeepers.- 2 - t- 4 After distribution, the Baladeyh to issue only a similar number of of purchase orders on each shop showing on the ration card or purchase orders the name of the shop to which to proceed to draw rations. This would assist- considerably the poorer people whose present experiences are tor of having to go from shop to shop only to be told and sometimes untruthfully that the stock is exhausted. After a lenghty discussion and in view of the larger quantities of foodstuffs involved it was agreed that instead of the present practise of dividing up the number of authorised shopkeepers monthly, ie. 45 selling one month, the other 45 the next and so on, that all 90 shop be issued monthly with an equal number of rations- all iden tical and that purchase orders wo Id be issued accordingly showing the name of the s lopkeeper, this will thus mean that each shopkeeper will receive monthly in the neighborhood of 350 rations and only 350 people will be allocated against each shop. This system is also to apply to Maharaq. The meeting was then informed by the Food Controller that in view of the number of complaints received from the inhabitants of Jidhafs- coupled with the resignation of the approved shopkeepers, Mansur bin Senad and lassan bin Hajy Aimed al Twwel, the Government had put cfcn hand the building of a Government shop at Suq-al Kharais to serve Jidhafs etc and this met with universal approval. Hajy Mhalil Ebrahim Moayed then requested that the Food Control Department made some arrangements in connection with the sale to the \ poor classes of cheap piece goods such as, Suwaly, Bafta, Cheat; and Malmal, which he stated they were unable to purchase at present, either due to the high prices demanded or to the shopkeepers lack of stock- due to hoarding by certain dealers. Hajy Khalil Tanoo suggested that the Food Control should take over 25 /j of the existing stocks for sale to the poorer class at landed cost plus a small profit and allow the merchants to sell the remaining 75% at prices to be fixed by the sellers.After a discussion the Food Controller proposed that one third of the stocks should be taken over and sold to the poorer classes at landed cost plus 5% profit, one third to be sold locally at un controlled price, and one third to be allowed for exporto In this way the public would benefit as also the merchants, as in view of the sale of one third at a controlled price the remaining third to be sold locally would not or rather could not be sold at rates showing excessive profits- the profits would accrue from the portion allowed for export and export would only of course be subject to existing stocks. At this point the Adviser pointed out the possibility of a quota being fixed for Bahrain in regard to piece goods, in which event export of such quota goods could not be sanctioned and to this the meeting agreed. It was however decided that the Food Controller should contact dealers and holders of piece goods stocks, put the foregoing before them and ascertain present stocks available, w r hen a decision would be made by hiii The meeting then discussed the prices of meat and decided to ask the Food Controller to interview the local butchers with a view to reducing the controlled price of b eef to not exceeding Rs:1.4.0 per ruba* This was in view of the plentiful supply of beef at present. Prices of Goat &amp; mutton to remain unchanged at present. The meeting closed at 11.35 a.ra.i! No. H5o. To The Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain. Towards the end of the proceedings of the meeting of the Food Control Committee held on the 26th &amp;ay 1943 the decision is recorded that the Food Controller should contact dealers and holders of piecegoods stocks, put certain suggestions before them and, after ascertaining existing stocks, make a decision in regard to the alloca tion of these stocks. . f I ^ 2. I understand that at present the export of cotton piecegoods of a type used in Bahrain is absolutely prohi bited while permission to export piecegoods of a type not used in Bahrain is only given in the case of Persian nakhudas who have imported into Bahrain essential commo dities of a value equal to that of the piecegoods to be exported• 3. The Government of India have fixed for the whole of the Persian Gulf a piecegoods quota which is very indeed. I do not know exactly what Bahrain* s share of this quota is but it must be very much below normal consumption. The Political Hesident is trying to have the Persian Gulf quota increased and I will let you know if he is successful. In the meantime, however, I suggest that, in regard to export , no change be made in the present procedure as described in paragraph 2 above. Sd/- E. B.

CYJjWtf fc £ a.^3 A meeting of the Food Control Committee was held at the Custom House, at 10 a.m. on Wednesday the 23rd June 19^3 5 over which His Excellency Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Xhalifah presided. There was a full attendance of members® The object of the meeting was to discuss the Tea situation and the following facts were put before the members by the Food Controller, At a meeting held on the 24th March 194-3 5 when the stock of tea was 6 l 8 cases,,, the committee decided to introduce rationing of tea and coffee on the basis of 2 oz tea and 4 oz coffee per head- but whilst the coffee ration w r as to be universal, tea was onlv to be . ' issued to the inhabitants of I anamah, Maharaq, Hedd and Haffa. At a sm e eld on 14th April 194 been revealed to members that the Government of India had granted a nonthly quota of 20 tons tea and 32 tons coffee effective Apri3. 1st 1943 for Bahrain, the ration of tea and coffee was doubled- ie 4 ozs tea and 8 ozs coffee per head. Unfortunately to date, it has not been possible to obtain the release for shipment of the tea and coffee quotas from India, with I the result there remain only 33 cases of tea in Bahrain. The meeting was further informed that prior to the rationing of the above commodities, the normal monthly consumption of the whole of Bahrain was 100 cases Tea and 300 bags coffee, from these figures it will be seen there was about six months stock of tea available as at 24th March 194-3 • • Since the introduction of rationing, the consumption of tea has jumped to 220 cases per month, whilst coffee has remained at the same level, with a slightly lower tendency if any. The rise in the consumption of tea, can therefore be only due to rationing, as it is agreed that the actual consumption has not increased to the extent as shown, but rather has it been possible for a large number of people to purchase their rations for re-sale at a subsequent date at slightly higher prices. This practice has ✓ * ^ •u d wot' v- 1 y cr o tec a r Vi or: et m tea. In view of the above, coupled with the very excellent coffee stocks ^presently Available' (Practically one years supply), the /fc the Food Controller proposed that tea, when again available, and coffee as from 1st Rajah should he sold unrationed, hut at a con trolled price, hut the meeting could not agree to this. It was agreed that the remaining tea he mithheld and. no tea ration issued for next month, and for coffee to he rationed as at present - . ie. 8 oz per head* The question of selling tea to he reconsidered when further stochs arrive. The me ting was then informed of the steps taken in regard to certain classes of cotton niece goods, full details of which are f’iven in the Political Agent's Elan of 23.6.43, and the decision met with the approval of the members. i As suggested hy Haiy Khalil Kanoo samples of the types of stocks to he taken over hy the Bahrain Government are to he given to retailers* There followed a long discussion on dates, or rather to do with the coming date season and certain propose]- including those oi coi^rect weighment, sale to Government, and outside es&amp;lss sales oe notified to the Government are being put- hy the Adviser before His Highness before any concrete arrangement is come to.Full details of any • &lt; scheme arrived at will be # advised when concluded. The meeting after a discussion on the high cost of cotton twist from which sail cloth is made decided to control prices and to allow the importers only 20^ profit over landed cost. The meeting finally discussed thp high cost of lime 'Hoora' a Bahrain uroduct, and decided rather than attempt to control prices to allow only 20.0 hags monthly for export. , 9 The meeting then closed at 12.J.p.m.&amp; w? No. S-S*&gt;Zf 0 f 1382 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 20th J/Thani 1362 the Government June 24, 1943• H. B* IPs Political Agent, Bahrain* Memorandum:- At a meeting of the Food Control Committee held on 23rd June 1943, the new regulation regarding sale of cheap cotton piece goods was read and strongly approved by all the members except one. It was the opinion of the meeting that the new measures would do much to reduce the present difficulty which is being experienced by the poor who wi3i to buy cheap cotton material* The dissenting member, Abdulrehman bin Abdulwahab Zayani, himself interested in the piece goods trade, considered that the percentage of profit was insufficient. For about eight months the situation, especially in the country, has been serious. Importers and retailers of piece goods in Manama have been trading actively, buying and selling piece goods among themselves. Any day bales of piece goods could be seen beiig conveyed through the bazaar from one merchant to another yet the man in the street was unable to buy his requirements except at a price far higher than the controlled rate. Merchants who had never had a finger in the piece goods trade bought large stocks of cheap material against the day when the shortage would be more acXmte and prices higher. Though the price of these piece goods was controlled the control was only partly effective and only persons who obtained an order from the Customs on a merchant were able to buy goods at the right price. S/7 j U3- £ - In many cases it seems that the control of prices of goods, without rationing, is of little help to the purchaser as the seller can and does refuse to sell with the excuse that he has no stock in his shop, this is often true as he keeps his stock of such things in his house, in the Bahrain villages today numbers of men wear nothing but old sacks and women both in towns and villages are in many oases compelled to keep to their houses because the clothes that they have are not sufficient to cover their bodies. In the town of Hedd, which in recent years has become a poverty striken place owing to the decline in the diving industry, the attendance of studehts at the Girls* School decreased noticeably during the last few months. When the reason for the decline in numbers was investigated it was found that many children could not come to school because their clothes would not cover them decently. For the same reason, but to a lesser extent, there was a decrease in attendances at some of the other Girls* Schools. The schools organised a fund for buying cheap material to clothe many of the students from poor homes to enable them to continue attending schools. Daily in the Orderly Hoorn at the Fort I am asked by Policemen, who are comparatively well paid, to help them to buy cheap cotton goods to clothe their families who they say cannot go out because they have nothing but rags to wear.During recent months I have myself seen both man and women, congregated at the village ration shops, whose clothes consist* of old rags which are scarcely sufficient to cover their nakedness. The reason for this state of things is not always that the people have not the money to buy clothes, in many cases they would buy the material if it was available. During the suzsmsr the lack of covering is not of great physical importance, men working in the country do not need to wear more than a loin cloth, they are probably healthier and cleaner without clothes. In the winter however, when the shamal wind blovfs bitterly cold, the poor of Bahrain, who live mostly in palm branch houses, will suffer seriously if they have nothing to wear. The vitality of the people is low, owing to their being reduced to exist on minimum rations with little sugar or dates and if during the coming winter they have no clothes with which to keep themselves warm there will be sickness and many deaths in Bahx’ain. An adequate supply of cheap cotton piece goods, of the type that has been available in the past, is essential to the people of Bahrain. Adviser to the GovernmentA meeting of the Food Control Committee was held at the Custom House, at lO.a.m* on Wednesday the 14th July 1943* His Excellency Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah being indisposed, was unable to attend. In the absence of the Adviser, due to urgent business reasons, and at the request of the members present, the Food Controller took the chair. The members present were: Shaikh Ebrahim bin Muhummad al Khalifah, Hajy Ahmed al Tweel, Hajy Khalil bin Ebrahim Kanoo, Hajy Abdul Neby Bushiry, Shaikh Abdulrehman bin Abdul Wahab al Zayani, Hajy Mohsen Tajir, Hajy Khalil Muayyid, Mr. Muhummad Saleh, and Mr. Ahmed Amran. The Chairman advised the meeting that through the good graces of the Political Agent it has been possible to obtain 499 cases Tea fnom Dubai and that these would be available for retail sale at Rs:14/- per ruba of 4 lbs. He suggested that this tea should be sold unrationed by shops allocated for the purpose and after a discussion this course was unanimously adopted and will come into force as from 1st Shaban 1362. The next question before the meeting was the question of t coffee sales. It has been found that due to the plentiful stocks available it is possible to purchase this commodity cheaper in the bazaar than in the authorised shops. The chairman then proposed that this commodity should also be sold unrationed as from 1st Shaban and after arguments for and against this had been raised by several members it was decided to give the proposal ie to issue coffee unrationed as from 1st Shaban, a trial for atleast two months. It was however, decided, inorder large scale to avoid possible/sales with a view to hoarding that any individual sales of over 50 bags should be notified in writing to the Food Controller.V*M r. The Food Controller then informed the meeting that it had come to his notice that the present ration of 1 lb per month of sugar given to the villages was being utilised to a large extent for personal gain, ie was being drawn as rations and subsequently brought into Manamah for resale* He then proposed that as the ration of 2 lbs per head for Manamah and Maharaq was in a number of cases inadequate that as from 1st Shaban 1362 the sugar ration should be: Manamah 2-i lbs per month* Maharaq 2|- ' ' ' Hedd 1 n ' ' Villages. £ ' ' ' With the exception of Hajy Mohsen al Tajir the meeting was in favour of this and after a lenghty discussion on the merits and demerits of this course by Hajy Mohsen al Tajir the motion as put forward by the Food Controller was passed and will take effect as from 1st Shaban 1362.

Rs.7/- for the 1st quality and Rs.6/- for the 2nd and 3rd qualities are considered to be reasonable but the Shaikhs’ argument is that the prices of everything have gdme high and that dates should be treated in the same way as other commodities. 2 . I heard that King Ibn Saud is going to send 15,000 gall^s of dates for the poor people of Bahrain to be distributed by Ousaibi and Abdul Aziz Bassam. It is stated that he adopted this method of distribution as he heard that his last year T s present of dates for the poor people of Bahrain, which he sent- to the Shaikh for distribution, was mishandled and the greater part of it did not reach the poor. The people consider these prices to be high and \D.O.No. /fy J7/3 Adviserate October 16, 1943. ^go) I find that last summer the Manama Municipal Council discussed the question of sale in the markets of fish and meat which had been kept in cold storage. After a discussion the majiis decided unanimously that no fish or meat which had been kept in cold storage should be sold in the Municipal markers. I understand that the members considered that the sale of such food was dangerous as though the meat and fish would appear to be fresh it would be liable to go bad very rapidly. The general public who buy in these markets assume that the commodities are fresh from the sea or the slaughter house. Major T. Hickinbotham, O.B.2., H. B.

My dear Belgr^yd, Please refer to your demi-official letter No* 1949-8 dated October 16th, 1943. 2. Z am afraid that a decision of the Manama Municipal Council, however unanimous, will not be applicable to persons who are not Bahrain subjects unless and until a King's Regulation is actually issued under Section 70(bj of the Bahrain Order-in-council by the Hon'ble the Political nesident in the Persian Gulf at the request of the Bahrain Government. This procedure is, I know you will agree, well known to the Bahrain Government but during the Inst few years does not seem to have been followed* 3. Mohammed Kaoosh has now filed a suit against the Manama Baladiyya for removing without proper authority the frozen fish he hod taken to the market to sell. I have no. alternative, since there is no rule of the Baladiyya under which they have authority to take such action in regard to foreigners, but to refor the case to the Joint Court for decision. Yours sincerely, dviser to the Bahrain Government Bahrain*Manama Municipal Department. Bahrain .

Haj Ahmed al Tawil. Ha 3 Abdulrehman Abdulvahab Zayani. Ha 3 Llahmood Bushiri. Ha 3 Khalil bin Ebrahim Kanoo. Hr. Hohamed Saleh Shatter. Mr. Ahmed al Omran. The meeting ooened with a discussion on the merits or demerits of a price control on the sale of Eggs, and after various members had exoressed their views a motion was carried that this commodity be con trolled and an Elan is being issued restricting the selling price to not more than Rs: 1.8.0 oer dozen Eggs. The next item on the agenda was the price of Milk, which after ^ a general discussion was fixed at not more than RsjI/- per ruba o: 4 Ids, With a view to a possible reduction in this price at a later date, it was decided to endeavour encourage the importation of date stones from Iraq., by granting a small inducement in the way of barter. Fish prices were next discussed and it was generally^ agreed that the present controlled price of Rs:l/- per ruba of 4 lbs was reasonable. The price of Chanard was fixed at Rs 1-4-0 per ruba. Ha 3 Khalil bin Ebrahim Moayedh then raised the question of the Government reducing the price of their present stock of Busran dates and selling same by the pound or ruba to the poor people. Several members expressed agreement with this, the Adviser however proposed that before anything further be done it would be advisable to have the views of the Poor Releif Committees. Accordingly these committees are being; invited to ^ send Representatives to the Aoviserate to discuss this question on Sunday the 14th inst. The question of high nr ices^ being obtained in the market for Cotton Piecegpods was then reSSSSu,. It appears these articles are changing hands repeatedly at higher margins oj. proj.it than those laid down in the Political Agent’s Order No.8 of 1943 of the 23rd June 1943, and are being purchased for re-sale to Persian Nacodas who are allowed to- export these commodities as barter. The Food Controller pointed out that unless purchasers who had to nay more than laid dov.n, complained to him, with prooj. it would oe difficult to control this traffic. It was however decided to Reissue the Government Elan in this connection, ask for the co-operation of the public in keeping prices reasonable, and to report profiteering to enable the Government punish such individuals. The meeting closed at 11.30 A.L. *The attention of * the Public is drawn to the undernoted Elan which was issued on 18th J/Thani, 1362 ■ (1) This Order applies to the varieties of cotton oiecegoods specified in the schedule hereto annexed. All cotton piece goods of these varieties which are at present in the hands of direct importers and all cotton piecegoods of these varieties^ which may henceforth be imported into Bahrain shall be covered by this Order. (2) In order to maintain a sufficient supply of cheap piecegoods for poor people the Bahrain Government shall take over irom d-ired imoorters for resale to poor people at a minimum price one-third of present stocks and future imports of the varieties of piece^ goods specified in the attached schedule. Direct importers will be allowed a profit of % on the landedlcost of the piecegoods taken over by' the Bahrain Government. (3) The balance of two-thirds of existing or future stocks of the varieties of piecegoods specified in the schedule shall be sold by Direct importers to established retail merchants at a profit which shall not exceed 2% of the landed cost* (4-) Retailers shall sell such piecegoods only to consumers and not to other retail merchants. The sale orice shall^not be more than 5^ in excess of the price paid by the retailer to the direct importer. (5) Every direct importer of varieties of piecegoods referred to in this Order shall maintain a register showing the nature, quantity and value of the piecegoods held or received by him to which this Order applies. In this register must be entered par ticulars of the price, quantity and name of retailer to whom goods are sold. The date of sale shall be also be entered. (6) Every retailer shall maintain a register showing the nature, quantity and value of piecegoods to which this Order applies which have been purchased by him from direct importers. A notice shall be displayed in each shop notifying the price per yard of all such goods. (7) The registers to be kept by direct importers and retailers shall be in the form attached to this Order” It has come to my notice that holders of piece goods are in many^ cases selling same at a higher margin of profit than that Laid down in the above Elan. The Public are requested to co-operate with the Food Control Department by reporting any acts of profiteering so that the necessary steps be tai en to punish the offenders.

PIECEGOODS The merchants r-epi’daented that the persona appointed by the Government of India 03 established shipper 1 * of piece^oods \ ere a hipping to Bahrain on theii' o : ./n account. • They stated that previou'^ly those shippers had shipped only a certain per centage of doods on their on account, for the remainder they had acted as amenta for Bahrain merchants and the ^oods vere shipped on the account of Bahrain Merchants• The members of the Committee represented that oxportere from India should be reouired to ship a fixed percentage of the quota on the account of the merchants in Bahrain. The President said that he ould represent their views to the Government of India through the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* II. CIGARETTES The question of the imports of cigarettes was discussed. In order to conserve shipping the Government of India have agreed to alio* a quota of five million cigarettes a month to Bahrain and as soon as this quota comes into force shipments from the United Kingdom will presumably cease. It as repre sented that one Bahrain merchant held the agency for uhe British American Tobacco Company of India and it was probable that al shipments from India would be made in his name. The Presicen asked the Director of Customs to let him kno, -hat imnoi ts from the United Kingdom v ere made during the years previous to tne var. He stated that as soon as this information was received he''ould examine the poaslblllty of the voiuntary of o tvirt of the future imports from Indin by the British -meric n Tobacco Comoany* s agent here as compenvsation to those merchants ho had suffered loss by the transference of the source of certain of our cigarette imports from the United Kingdom to India.

Bir, 1 have the honour to refer to your telegram Ko.T/1195, dated the Both November 1943, and to inform you that I have not boon made acquainted by the Government of India *:ith the names of persons *;ho have been appointed as established shippers of piecegoods from Bombay to Bahrain and the Trucial Coast. I shall be grateful if the Government of India can be asked to supply this information as soon as possible in order that yre may introduce measures locally for the con trolling of the price of certain cheaper varieties of material. 2. The principal merchants of piecegoods into Bahrain have represented to me that the established shippers in Bombay are shipping their whole quota on their orm account$ that is to say, the Bahrain merchants have been forced into the position of agents for the exporters from India. Prior to the intro duction of the quota system I am assured that the majority of the Indian exporters acted as agents for Bahrain merchants and did not export their goods from India on their own account. The Government of Indian policy in insisting on our dealing with exporters appointed by them has given the Bombay dealers a very great advantage, an advantage which in my opinion is not justified. I shall be grateful if the Government of India can be moved to issue such instructions as may be necessary to the Export Trade Controller Bombay to ensure that at least 50 per cent of the piecegoods exported by established shippers are on the account of Bahrain importers. ' /3. %3 (w) c\ 4 • It has further been represented to me that although quotas have been allotted for the export of piecegoods both for Bahrain and the Trucial Coast neither of these places are receiving their full quota. This is said to be due to the fact that the Export Trade Controller in Bombay will not permit merchants to export more than their average exports for certain years prior to 1941. This means, assuming my information ms correct, that should an established shipper in Bombay have a quota for five tons a month for the Trucial Coast the Export Trade Controller will only permit him to export three tons a month if his average exports for the stipu lated period have not exceeded that amount. It is in ity opinion essential that the Political Agent should be informed not only of the names of the established shippers as requested in paragraph one of this communication but also of the percentage of the quota which they have been allotted. At the same time Export Trade Controllers should be directed to permit e^orts up to the amount allotted to the trader by the Government of India irrespective of what his previous average exports were. If the Export Trade Controller is himself the allotting authority then I suggest that he divide the quota among exporters in such a way that the utili sation of the full quota is ensured.

The President informed tho mooting of tho proposal to cancel certain Orders issued since 1939 and to rc-issue a now Order which would embrace all matters to do with Food Control and Price Control. He sought their opinion with regard to percentage profit to bo mode on motor tyres and tubes, motor cycle tyres and tubes, bicycle tyros and tubes, and electrical batteries of six volts or more. Tho Political Agent decided that 40 per cent was reasonable profit for all types of tyros ana that oving-to losses due to breakage etc., on consignments of batteries it would be very difficult to lay down any fixed percentage on this type of imports. It was decided that tho percentage profit would bo fixed for each consignment by the Customs Department in consultation with the Political Agent V. The question of the export of certain goods from Bahrain we a raised by a member. Tho President stated that tho x rinciplc governing the export of all goods from Bahrain vis that only goods surplus to the requirements of tho local population could bo exported. Intending exporters should make applications to the Director of Customs who would certify whether or not in his opinion the goods wore in fact surplus and that application would then be presented to the Political Agent who \ ould base his decision with regard to export on the recommendation of the Director of Customs. He would normally act in accordance with the Director's recommendation. VI. The question of the imoort of cigarettes was raised by the President who pointed out that Messrs. .Abdullah Audan atfid Bros., imported 78 per cent of the total imports between Aaril 1st, 1938 and March 31st, 1939. The Presi dent stated that he would ask Mr. Aujan to see him and suggest that he should set aside 22 per cent of future imports from India to be divided proportionately among tho other importers. VII. The President informed tho moating of the quota allot ments of piecegoods for the quarter ending March 3lst, 1944.

(Sd.) T.HICKXNBOTHAM &gt;fh B e. 1943. PRESIDENTIn confirmation of a conversation between the undersigned and Mr. Jackson on Sunday November 21st 1943? the following is a brief resume of the practise in force at present in Bahrain in regard to rationing, price control etc., together with a current list of the articles, the price of which is controlled* Rationed Articles • \-^ The ration per adult per month of cereals in Manama and Maharaq is as under: 4 lbs Barley 4 lbs Flour 12 lbs Wheat, and 2 -£ lbs of sugar. In Manama there are 96 authorised shops and each shop is issued monthly with an equal number of rations. Similarly each ration card bears the name of the shop from which rations are to be purchased, and the number of persons allocated to each shop corresponds to the number of rations supplied. By this method it is not possible for the shopkeeper to refuse to sell on the pretext that his supplies are exhausted. In Maharaq there are 50 authorised shops and the same procedure as in Manama applies. Hedd The residents of Hedd purchase their rations from a Government owned shop which was opened for this purpose in May of this year, and their ration is similar to Manama and Maharaq with the exception of sugar which is 1 lb per head. The Villages . The population of the villages amounts to practically half of the total population of the island, and for purposes of easy dis tribution, are divided into centres, which have been chosen as being most convenient to the inhabitants. Here again each person has a ration card and adults are given per head per month: 5 lbs Barley 15 lbs Wheat, and ^ lb of sugar. The centres are as under: 1* Suq al Khamis No.l which also serves: 2.

Out of the above, the centres of Suaq al Khamis No.l &amp; 2, Sitra, Budaiyah, Raffa and Zalla^ are served by Government owned shops, the remainder by approved Government shopkeepers. With regard to the issue of these rations, ie. Sugar, Barley, Flour, and Wheat, supplies are issued from Government owned stocks, the shopkeepers or retailers selling same at a profit of 2$. In the case of Government owned shops the profit is set against shopkeepers and clerks salaries. Tea and Coffee are sold unrationed, stocks being plentiful. Piece Goods a To ensure adequate supplies of certain cheap cotton piece goods, the Government of Bahrain, took over 1/3 of existing stocks of certain popular types used by the poor people and also arranged to take over 1/3 of all new arrivals of these types.

The discussions were most amicable and the line whfbto I adopted was that I felt sure that our very difficult position in Bahrain was not understood by the Middle East Supply Committee nor did they understand the unique problem of supply and distribution on the Trucial Coast. I welcomed this opportunity of presenting our case to their representative feeling that by so doing any suspicion that we were misrepresenting the position to the M.E.S.C. would be finally allayed and that we should have the satisfaction of feeling that future communications to them would be considered by individuals who had personal knowledge of our difficulties. Captain Stoner adopted the attitude, which I consider was the proper one for him to adopt, that he was in search of knowledge and not investigating a possible suggestion that the Political Authorities in the Persian Gulf were intentionally overstating the seriousness of the food position for some unspecified reason. The Middle East Supply Council were profoundly disturbed at the position as represented to them by us and desired to obtain the fullest possible information on the subject with a view to ensuring that in future there would be no avoidable shortage of cereals either here or on the Trucial Coast. 3. CEREALS*- (a) Bahrain; position, and later in the evening Mr.Smith the Director of Customs and Food Controller Bahrain explained in detail the working of the Bahrain rationing scheme and exactly what our position as regards cereal stocks had been on the 1st of December 1 Captain Stoner arrived in the afternoon of unc , of January and was met by me at the airport. 2. As soon as we arrived at the Agency we commenced our 2 . I gave Capt. Stoner a general outline of the cereal and ..- 2 - and was today. We both of us stressed the very serious position that the island would have been in had it not been that a parcel of 1250 tons of wheat destined for Saudi Arabia was present here in U.K.C.C. stocks and had we not refused to carry out the Middle East Supply Council’s instructions to authorize Gray Mackenzie &lt;5c Company to deliver 4/5 of the parcel to the Saudi Arabian Government at the end of November. Captain Stoner was very anxious to know whether stocks were being hoarded by the general public or by the Government. He was assured both by Mr.Smith and myself that there was no hoarding by the Bahrain Government who had no hoarded stocks on which to fall back in times of strain and that he could test the accuracy of our statements by an examination of our import figures and t he rationing system. As far as hoarding by private individuals was concerned, I gave it as my opinion that there was very little and that what there was was confined to a few merchants who had probably put aside a certain amount of rice for their own personal use. I said I consider,that at least one month’s reserve of cereals should be maintained as a reserve in the hands of the Director of Customs Bahrain in order to enable his rationing scheme to work without interruption and to form an emergency reserve if supplies failed to arrive according to schedule. Just prior to Mr.Smith's interview with Capt.Stoner Mr.J.M.Campbell the Manager of Gray Mackenzie &amp; Company called at my request and touched on certain aspects of the U.K.C.C. operations which he thought might well be improved. Capt.Stoner explained to Mr.Campbell that he was not really concerned with the doings or misdemeanours of the U.K.C.C. in their capacity as the distributors of foodstocks, but he suggested that any representations that we might wish to make should be made to MEBOD in Cairo and that failing satisfaction from them our only hope was to approach the Ministry of Food. This point arose in connection with a request by the Bahrain Government for exact details of the stocks of wheat ex the S.S. f, BRAGANZA u which the U.K.C.C- 3 - U.K.C.C. had declined to give as it was not so they said n in accordance with commercial practice* 1 . Mr.Campbell welcomed the idea of a barley pool here and said he thought storage for 16000 tons would be available. Mr.Smith pointed out that we did not want barley and saw no use in maintaining a large stock. 1^00 tons would be ample. very broadly the system in force and the difficulties with which we were faced both as regards distribution and also as regards obtaining accurate information about actual issues and, what was even more difficult, making forecasts of future require ments. In answer to a question of Captain Stoner I said that I thought that a quota of 1900 tons per month would be expended during the winter but that previously owing to the absence of the pearl divers we had not in fact been using our entire quota which was just as well as if we had had to draw to the limit we should have exhausted the supplies available some weeks ago. I explained to him how the error over stocks which we had recently discovered had occurred and suggested that Captain Tandy the Political Officer Trucial Coast would be in the best position to acquaint him in detail with the Trucial Coast rationing scheme and the system by which stocks were taken up by an association of merchants of Dubai and in some cases distributed to consumers through the Shaikhs and in some cases through specially appointed retail merchants. 4. DATES. under the impression that there was no 'date problem** but that he had since learned that there was indeed a problem and that it was an extremely serious one. paragraph by paragraph and very candidly. He expressed his views on how the very serious situation had come about. Most of what (b) Truclal Coast: As far as the Trucial Coast was concerned, I explained Captain Stoner said that when he left Cairo he was Captain Stoner went through the Hon*ble the Political ' Resider telegram No.2538 dated the 30th Decemoer Captain© - 4 - Captain Stoner had to say I was already av/are of, for example that the Ministry of Food would in fact obtain 6 shillings on each basket of dates sold through Andrew Weir &amp; Company as their own commission, but I confess I was surprised when he told me that Andrew Weir &amp; Company maintained that they had already sold and shipped approximately 2000 tons of dates to the Trucial Coast and 832 tons of dates to Bahrain. I explained to him what was in ray opinion the true position and read to him extracts from letters from merchants whom we had appointed to purchase dates on behalf of Bahrain and the Trucial Coast confirming that Andrew Weir &amp; Company had not sold them dates but had insisted on taking their commission of 24-^- dinars per kara and sending the merchants into the open market to purchase as best they could with the result that we had not obtained anything like our essential requirements. I gave him the names of Muhamad bin Tunian A1 Ganim the Bahrain buying agent in Basrah, and Haji Ahmad bin Abdullatif al Hamad who I believe is the Kuwait buying agent and has also I understand been appointed by the Aden Government to purchase and ship the 10000-ton quota for Aden and Somaliland. I suggested to him that he should send for these gentlemen or call upon them when next he was in Basrah and ask them either to confirm whether they had been able to purchase and in fact were purchasing the quotas allotted to the areas they represented from Andrew Weir &amp; Co. at 40 dinars a kara or to confirm that Andrew Weir &amp; Co. would not sell to them but sent them into the market to make their own purchases as best they could at pricejTn excess of 40 dinars a kara~ ^enerall y)and this only after they had paid Andrew Weir &amp; Company^ commission. He would then know whether Andrew Weir &amp; Co were speaking the truth or whether our agents were speaking the truth, but whatever either party said, I told Captain Stoner that I had been present in Captain Murchison 1 office (the Basrah Manager of Messrs.Andrew Weir &amp; Company) with Haji Ahmad bin Abdullatif al Hamad when Capt. Murchison had at my request explained to Haji Ahmad that he would have to pay the commission and then he could buy in the market • • • •r i - 5 - 10 % market from whoever he liked hut that he (Murchison) had bought no dates of the basket type and did not intend to do so # Captain Stoner said that he thought that it was business practice to demand commission before delivery in certain cases and that Andrew Weir &amp; Co. maintained that if they did not collect their commission and that of E.M.•s Government before permitting the merchants to purchase they would be unable to do so later. I pointed out that as Andrev/ Weir &amp; Co. authorised all shipments from Basrah and as no vessel could leave without their permission, the most satisfactory thing would have been for them to have collected their commission on vessels when loaded prior to issuing the necessary export permits. The present practice was to insist on their commission and to do absolutely nothing whatsoever in return for the money. Captain Stoner asked whether dry dates would be acceptable in Bahrain or the Trucial Coast as he thought that it would be possible to make a certain quantity available, but both Mr.Smith and myself said we did not consider that dry dates would be acceptable as v;e did not think the people would eat them. However we would make inquiries and give him a definite reply on his return from Sharjah. His second suggestion that if dry dates were not acceptable then wet dates in boxed form, possibly of the ”hallawi variety”, could be obtained by negotiations by the M.E.S.C. from Andrew W T eir &amp; Co. at the same price as the basket dates were to have been, i.e. 40 dinars a kara, was received with gratitude and we expressed the opinion that the dates would be more than acceptable. Capt. Stoner made it clear that he was now speaking without having previously consulted his senior officers, but he hoped that Andrew Weir &amp; Co. could be persuaded to part with 6000 tons of boxed dates at the price of the basket dates. This would mean a loss, in his estimation, of about £14000/- to Andrew Weir &amp; Co. but this loss was nothing to their profit of £150000/-. 5. Later in the evening I mentioned to Capt. Stoner that His Highness had on more than one occasion drawn my attention to the6 !( 7 the fact that oil from his country was being delivered to Egypt but that rice from Egypt was not being delivered to Bahrain. His Highness considered that Bahrain's need of rice was at least as great as Egypt's need of Bahrain oil. His Highness felt very strongly on this point and had said that he really did not see why oil should continue to be delivered without some return. a small quantity of rice and suggested that tankers coming from Suez bound for Bahrain to lift fuel oil, etc. should be allowed to bring a minimum quantity of 300 tons of rice a month as deck cargo. Captain Stoner did not seem very hopeful that he would be able to arrange anything of this nature but agreed to try and do his best. 6 . With regard to supply of wheat by tankers from Australia, Captain Stoner said that the M.V/.T. refused to permit tankers to be diverted to Bahrain and therefore wheat was being overcarried to Abadan. From Abadan it found its v/ay to a pool in Basrah and from that pool was distributed. I asked Captain Stoner how it v.as that when we were in urgent need of wheat we were forced to accept high-grade flour at a high-grade price when the v/heat was in fact available in Basrah. He said that it was a question of shipping but he did not appear to be very sure of his ground when I replied that the flour had to be shipped and loaded in Basrah and that I did not understand why when it was possible to ship flour from Basrah it was not possible to ship wheat from the same place in the same vessel. I stressed the urgent need of providing us with even© 4tS? Continuation of my Note dated the 9th January 1944 on the vieit oi Captain Stoner, The Reprebentative of the M.h.e.C.toBahrain. Captain Stoner’o aircrait broke do*n on arrival in Bah oin owing to alleged damage to a petrol feed pipe* So accommodation for Sharjah w&amp;e found for him on the morning of the 8th in a B,o.A.C.machine. He returned from Sharjah on the 9th and intende leaving for iBushiretoday the lOth* On hie return from Sharjah Captain Stoner told hfcm that he thought the food distribution system was on the whole working well, ^t appears that he was taken to one or two villages and was able to see the grain on sale and the stocks, such as there were, in the approved retailers* godowns. I understand that he did not visit either the shaikh of Sharjah or the Shaikh of Dubai which I think was a pity, but the alternatives seem to have been either visiting the Shaikhs or examining the distributing system. T h? d suggested to Captain Tandy that e visit to the Shaikh of Dubai should be included in his programme for Captain Stoner’s visit and I regret that this part of the programme was not carried cut. Captain Stoner started that he had an interview with Mess re. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co.’s representative but was unable to obtain a great deal of information as the man had only recently been ;.ppointed but he was informed that they still had 1,300 tons not delivered. Cant a in Stoner indicated th«t the P.O.T .C .unfortunat ely had not exoectea him to arrive when he aid owing to the fact that he had failed to examine an ’’Immediate” signal which had been sent by me on the evening of the Vth January and that therefore tfie re has been some waste of time. I received the impression that he thought that more statistics should have teen maintained '• na that there should have teen more administrative control over the supply of essential food stuffs to the Coast, but I pointed out that it was quite impossible without a trained staff several hundred per cent larger than the P.O.T.C.is blessed with at the moment/V 1 1; Prge S. © ni 'i r~i ^ even to think of introlucing c iOQ, effective ? nd ..odern rationing scheme to sry nothing of Uic fleet of lorries which •will be neceasery tc ij; j -le...M.l r n. df-rn di^tri utioa sehew. hovever, wLr.t ever Cr^trin 'toner* s views r r&gt; on c ur id# t hod, or i ck of method, of derling with these . rollers I should be interested to see the result should he he de. uted to t^ke ch?r t e vit' the present strff of the ditribution end rationing of dries oivd cere'Is to the Trucirl Co a at Sheikhdoms and he uin tribes.

Th* 'haikli s^. ke hia mind freely and I translated iitercily vith the result that I believe Captain Ttoner res surprises at Ue depth of feeling which His highness revealed.

C. * at ■ itical _h —J$uthorities v/ere doing their utmost for his people but they have no Heal source of supply and that he must hold the M.E.S.C. responsi le for the results of failure to maintain our supplies which in his opinion would be internal commotion and deaths from starvation. He announced that he had given every possible aid to His Majesty*s Government and that oil from his country was going to Egypt from which country, although they have a surplus of rice, he received no assistance whatso ever. He desired the M.E.S.C. to arrange for at least 5,000 bags of rice to be sent to Bahrain each month on tankers coming for oil. He touched on the Australian wheat situation and said how necessary it was that cheap wheat within the purchasing power of the local inhabitants should be brought here, and gave it as his view that the best way to do this was to employ tankers returning to Bahrain from Australia as a means of transport for Australian wheat. The date question caused him considerable excitement and he affirmed that only a fraction of the quota had so far arrived. I must emphasize that His Highness spoke with deter mination and Shaikh Mohammed who was unusually silent broke in from time to time especially when Captain Stoner replied to His Highness and touched on conditions in Egypt. Shaikh Mohammed mentioned that he had resided himself in Egypt and added that rice was very little used. Captain Stoner informed His Highness that he had welcomed the opportunity to discuss this important question with him and that he would most certainly represent his view to the M.E.S.C. and put forward his requests but he was not in a position to make any promises. As regards the dates Captain Stoner enquired if dry dates would be a welcome substitute and received a very clear answer in the negative. Captain Stoner said that he felt sure that arrangements could be made to fulfil the undertaking with regard to the datex whereupon His Highness trusted that the arrangements would be complete bfifflEebefore starvation ensued. The pearling season was mentioned and the necessity for provisioning some 17,000 men was gone into and also the disadvantages of flour as compared with wheat and wheat as compared with rice were explained at length. The interview lasted for a matter of an hour and twenty minutes and was in no way tedious. 3. Captain Stoner asked me whether there are any special reasons why Bahrain should receive rice and I pointed out to him that for political reasons I considered it essential that everything should be done to meet His Highness' wishes and in answer to his next question whether there would be any grumbling in the other States in the Gulf if rice was made available for Bahrain I replied that it might be possible to arrange fax some reasonable distribution but as that was a question which affected the Gulf as a whole I advised him to consult the Hon'ble the Political Resident. Captain Sooner met# the Adviser to the Bahrain Government at the Agency on the evening of the 9th of January, and he had a discussion with him after dinner. ^e also called on Mr. J.M. Campbell of Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co. 7 &gt;. 10-1-44.\\ . \ . ^ ^ • &amp; A meeting of the Food Control Comnittee was held at the Adviserate on Wednesday December 29th 194-3 &gt; at 10 A*1U, the following were present: r.E.Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa A1 Khalifah, C.I.E., Mr.C.Dalrymple Belgrave C.B.E,, Adviser to the Govt, Mr .C.W.R,Smith, Food Controller.

Mr. Mohamed Saleh Shatter, Mr. Ahjned al Onran. The meeting was called primarily for the purpose of informing the members and through them no doubt the public, just what the Govern ment had undertaken in the purchase and distribution of essential food stuffs to the general public. The accounts for the year 1362 were explained capably by Mr. Sayed Mahmood, the Head Clerk, Adviserate, and showed that the Govern ment made payments of approximately JO lakhs of rupees during the year, made up as under: Purch. ses of Wheat, B? rley, &amp; Flour ' ' Dates. ” Sugar. ' Piece goods Add advance paid against purchasing and shipping New Basrah dates ^ : Rs *24,96,000/- H 9,00,000/- M 6,50,000/- M 4.00.000/- ,4-6,000/- _l t OO jL OOOZ- 49.46. 000 /- In addition more Government shops were ojyened during this year, further clerks engaged and salaries, printing, transporting foodstuffs etc came to about a further ftS*50/60,000. During the year 1363 it is anticipated that this figure will increase to Rs*85,000/-. At the end of the year, the Government held stocks of wheat, ^ flour, barley, sugar, piecegoods, charcoal, dates, soap, washing soda, dhall and tea, valued at Rs*12,59&gt;800/-. The Food Controller then explained to the meeting the reason for the increased cost to the public of wheat and barley as from 1st Muhurrum 1363 , which *s now , Yheat annas 12 per ruba of 4 lbs. Barley annas 11 per ruba of 4 lbs, as against Wheat annas 10 per ruba of 4 lbs. .o//**' Barley annas 10 per ruba of 4 lbs, charged last month. When good supplies of wheat ex Tankers from Australia wjrfere arriving and which cost considerably less than recent supplies from India and Iraq, it had been possible^to Jeep the rate lower, but with this prospects no longer in view and to avoid a heavy loss to the Government, it has been necessary to charge the public the cost to the Government.r' 7 : -2- The meeting thanked the Government Tor their efforts. S&gt; Hajy IJioXil Kanoo then informed the meeting he had heard complaints against Uaharaq shopkeepers who, it is alleged were refusing to sell Bahrein dates to the poorer classes at controlled prices* As this was the first intimation of this after a discussion it was decided to leave the matter in the hands of the Secretary of the Maharaq Municipality to deal with. He has been instructed in writing by the Food Controller to investigate and report his findings, as also what he has effected* Haj Abaulrehr an Abdulwahab Zayani then suggested that the price of meat might be reduced, but after a discussion, and in vi*-v* ol che irregularity of supplies arriving, it was decided to leave the prices at the same level for the time being* Haj ISohsin Tajir then mentioned that at times there ?/as a delay in people obtaining their ration cords from the Municipality and asked that steps be taken to remedy this* The Secretary of the Municipality promised to look into the matter and expedite the issuance of ration cards* The meeting then closed at 11*15«A*M* 4^ y/ *Vv\ ki^ •' n '77 7 *5 O Dated.

Every achj.lt is in receipt of two ration cards monthly, one for sugar and oneT 20 lbs cereals, consisting of flour, barley and wheat; these cards show the quantity, price, and the name of v the shop from which the rations are to be purchased, and in order that the Iviumcipality- who issue these cards, may do so expeditiously, it is necessary for them to have the information as to what the rations are. ten 5^6 in advance of the month for which the issues are to be made/ ..y having one month’s stock in reserve this can be done and the public enabled to obtain their cards on the 1 st of every month. Reverting now to our conversation re expensive household , this commodity can I think be dispensed with entirely, as in flour • ' # V —-r S* r» V/Xi ^ XJL O O.JL &lt;3; JL Y • Cl O -1.11 viev/ oi the revised quota of 1,000 tons cereals monthly., and provided out of this we can be allotted 750 tons of wheat, and 256 tons^barley. . mixed milled wheat and barley flour could be issued to the public at cheaper rates. Rice, has been, and always will be when obtainable, the stapie diet of the Ba lira in public and due to the lack of this commodity, ajl ailments are put down to the change in diet. Wheat, and in particular crushed wheat, eaten in the form of a porridge, is the only substitute they have at all taken to, anc it is thereiore essential that maximum quantities of this commodity are made available. From the allotment of 750 tons wheat and 2^0 tons barlev- it will be possible to issue to the towns peoole of Manama, Maharaq and Hedd, a monthly ration per adult of: 4 lbs flour 4 lbs barley 12 lbs wheat, and for the villages, which form quite a large percentage of the total population: 5 lbs barley 15 lbs wheat. In connection with the villages flour would not be of any great advantage, as there are no baking facilities. With regard to the question of forming a Barley Stock pool at Bahrain,- whilst this would be advantageous, I suggest for storage sake, the quantities be limited to 1,500 tons at one time. DIRECTOR OF CUSTOMS AND PORT OFFICER, BAHRAIN.A SECRET Political Agency, D.O.No.C/50. Bahrain, 9th January, 1944. (So) My dear Sir Geoffrey, J I enclose a memorandum which was drawn up by Smith as a result of our deliberations with Stoner on the evening of the 7th of January. I have discussed this memorandum both with Belgrave and with Smith and they are both prepared to stand or fall by the statements of requirements made therein, If we can obtain 300 tons of rice, which you will see from my note on ray conversation with Stoner I have pressed him to endeavour to have set aside from the Egyptian surplus and conveyed here by tanker, then we shall be glad to give up 300 tons of the 750 tons of wheat that we have now demanded. I consider that the memorandum gives a correct esti mation of Bahrain*s essential requirements of cereals. I have handed Stoner a copy of Smith's note for his information.

It established the Department of Supply (referring C&amp;A’ to Food etc Controller) with branches in sections of /vtowns and /^N villages. It also established a committee composed of the notables and the learned to set prices and to study what is beneficial for the nation. It also framed strict Laws to eliminate hoarders who do not consider the advantage of the public and who have no thoughts but to charge excessive profits on what goods they hid or hoarded. It has also asked the public to Inform against any seller who sells at high prices so that he may meet his just retribution and become an example for others to the benefit of the public. During the year 1362 the Government bought foodstuffs, piece goods and other commodities controlled by the Supply Department to the value of 51 lakhs. Rupees. In addition to 12 Ikhs paid, in the preceeding year. Thus the total cost of what was bought by the Government would be 63 lakhs Rupees. The Government sold these goods at cost and some times below cost so that the public may get their food as cheap as possible. Against this reduction tne Govemr.^ent added profits on commodities allowed for export on barter basis like Tea and Sugar. This will be explained by the following statements Rs ♦ Loss Rs. Profit 112,000 In selling Wheat Barley and Flour. 98,000 On sale of Sugar » ' ' Tea 17,300 56,700 In selling Dates ' ' ' Rice 13,800 33,600 In transport.

The Government in this case and other cases seeks what is beneficial for the population and tries her best to obtain it. In the budget for the year 1363, she has allocated the sum of Rs. 55,000 for the expenses incurred by the Supply Department in wages, printing charges etc. She has also allocated a sum of Rs 60,000 to meet any loss that may occur. She has also allocated the sum of Rs 45,000 to help the poor. Of this Rs 36,000 will be spent by the Municipalities and the Committee for helping the Poor* Rs 9,000 has been allocated to feed and clothe the poor^in village schools. All this besides what the municipalities spend from their own funds and what the s y/ Poor Relief Committees do. No doubt the driving power to these steps,taken in the past, and the steps to be taken in future is 'Sahib el Adhema Hakim el Bilad el Muffada' who does his share in this field and who pays the from his own funds to several charity institutions. Of it is/bread cLl . ma xx distributed at^Kunicipalities of Mana/and Muhharraq every day. May God keep him for the benefit of his country and nation.

The Political Agent agreed that the same procedure could be adopted on the Truciel Coast. Mr* Magleton stated that all the wheat that arrived from2 - 4* Th« atorag# of tha sugar ax a^s.^Dalgoma'* sine a August was discuasad. Mr. iSaglaton admittad that a part of tha daisy was dua to an arror on tha part of tha D.K.C.C. and stated that they war a praparad to refund storage charges for tha period concerned. After discussion it was agreed not to press for a return of storage charges as the price of tha sugar at 33 ah. 1'd. par evrt. has now bean agreed and it would be better not to reopen tha matter, ‘fha Politics Agent was careful to exolain to Mr. ^agleton that the question of storage charges was one which affected the Shaikhs very closely as if goods ware delivered on arrival they could be stored in warehouses actually owned by the Shaikhs and ail charges will thus be avoided with the result that the goods can later be released for sale to the general public at a reduced figure. 'y 5. Mr. iSagletoii raised the question of the wheat flour which had now been offloaded at Bahrain, and at Dubai and Sharjah. The unsuitability of wheat flour was explained by the Political Agent and by Tr. Smith, and the added disadvantage of the extremely high cost of this particular consignment was made clear. It was pointed out that the Political Authorities had time and time again explained that wheat flour was unsuitable but that their explanations and protests appear to have been unheeded. The “oliticaL Agent asked Mr. iiiagleton for an explanation of this state of affairs and was informed that the present glut of wheat flour in the Persian Gulf was due (a) to the M.a.S.C. having failed to take heed of s* telephone conversation which he Mr. 2 »agleton had had with his Head Cilice in Cairo to the effect that wheat flour stocks were increasing * to too great an extent and that wheat stocks were dangerously low, and _ (b) to the necessity for secrecy regarding the move of troops from Iraq which made it impossible for the Supply Department concerned to cancel shipments of wheat flour for the Army until the troop© had actually left, by which time large quanti ties of flour which were no longer required by the Army had been loaded and were on their way to the Persian Gulf. The Political Agent suggested that as this surplus was due to military causes it would seem to be fair for the Treasury to bill the War Office for at least a proportion of the cost and thus reduce the /*rice to one within the reach of the local people, hr. ^agleton did not view this suggestion with any hope that it \ ould b$ accepted in more exalted quarters. He said that the point was whether we /wantedtc ni wanted it or not and for reasons which had been outside our own and his control, the flour was here and that it was his business to get rid of it with the least possible loss* Mr* Smith stated that Bahrain could use about 200 tons a month provided they were allotted 700 tone of wheat a month and 100 tons of barley for adulterating with the wheat flour, ihat was the most that they could accept* They have already taken over 660 tons from Messrs* Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co and it was agreed that Mr* itegleton would re commend the following releases to the Bahrain Gov rnmentj- He would however bear in mind that from May onwards the Bahrain Government did not wish for any flour whatsoever and would prefer 300 wons of barley instead of 'the 200 tons of flour and 100 tons of barley, and he said that if he could possibly manage to disnose of the flour elaewhere(Baucli Arabia) he would endeavour to meet their wishes* As regards the Trucial Coast the Political Agent said that he was not pi'epared to give an absolutely definite undertaking but that he would have to reserve the right to amend anything at present agreed to should he find that the facts as at present known to him were not in accordance with what he expected to see on his forthcoming visit to the Trucial Coast. With that proviso he would agree to absorb 400 tons of flour a month on the Trucial Coast until the present stocks of 2000 tons at Sharjah and Dubai had been exhausted. The same practice would have to be followed as in Bahrain and flour be used instead of barley, that is to say, they would require 1,260 tons of wheat from the 1st of February onwards in addition to the 400 tons of flour which they had agreed to absorb and 250 tons of barley* The flour stocks at present are;- January February March April . * * 300 tons wheat « * 700 r ‘ 700 H 700 M • * • * * * * • • ♦ 90 n flour ♦ 40 * Barley May * * * 700 * Wheat 200 ' Flour ♦ 100 ' Barley Bahrain Government •• Bahrain (U*K,C*C .Stocks) * * 660 tons 1,660 tons /Trucial20th January 1944. ^ Political Agent, Bahrain.

J^* Smith, Mr* Campbell, and the Political Agent said that they felt sure that now that he knew the facts of the case they could rely uoon him to do his best* The present quoted cost by the U.K.C*C. for this particular ship ment of flour is £*39*L per Metric Ton*2 ^ in DjO.lfo.C/^ {&gt;$ Bahrain, 6 U 1 February 1944. r.y dear Be l£ rav e , 1 shall be very glad if you can let me know who authorised the publication of the article 'Supplies of Bahrain' published in ‘AX Bahrain* Issue Ko.256 dated the 27th of January 1944.

In continuation of my D.O.No. 282/50SF dated 9th February 1944, regarding your query about profit on rice and loss on 'wheat. During 1361 the Bahrain Government sold approximately eight lakhs worth of rice and in 1362 rice to value of 13.1,20,000/- was sold. A small margin of profit was made on these rice sales amounting to is. 13,000/-. Some of the rice was bought by the Bahrain Government through local merchants from I n dia and some was bought from local bazaar stocks. Regarding wheat prices, the loss was due to the cost of wheat supplied by the U.K.C.C. being higher than the original shipments by tankers. The average cost of tankers wheat was 240/- per ton C.I.F. Bahrain. ./heat from s. s.’’Stevenson- Taylor Tt , from Basra, was invoiced at *.3.368/- per ton C.I.F. Bahrain and other shipments were also more costly than tanker wheat. During November and December the price of wheat was not raised although it was costing the Government considerably more than the price for which it was being sold. The Government, in fact, subsidized wheat which had become the staple food of the country in ordei to enable the public to buy it at a reasonable niic Z 1 Major T. Hickinbotham, O.B.F., C.I.F., H. B.

I am taking the opportunity of the 'Resang' being here to send you a hasty line about the price of cereals on. the Trucial Coast. The Food Company, which was formed to deal with the import and distribution, under the Political Officer Trucial Coasts general supervision, of cereals and sugar and is composed of leading merchants of all communities in Dubai, has been entrusted with the sale of the sugar reserved for barter purposes. This sugar costs approximately fc.60/- a bag but the Food Company have found it possible to sell it at the rate of fc.360/~ a bagZto persons actually importing livestock, dates, or other essential requirements, and provided further that the Rs.oOO/- profit per bag was set aside to be used to reduce the price of cereals and did not accrue to the shareholders in the Food Company. The somewhat startling result of this policy is that approximately 8 lacs of rupees have been accumu lated by the Food Conp3.ny curing the last 3 or 4 months. 3. On the 11th I attended a meeting of the Directors of the Company with Shaikh Rashid bin Said who was deputising for his father the Shaikh of Dubai who is away hawking. It was decided that the money must be used for the benefit of the general public of the Trucial Coast and the meeting was reminded by me and con firmed by all present that the first call on this sum should be to reduce the cost of cereals. At the suggestion of Shaikh Rashic bin Said and several members it was decided to reduce the price of barley to approximately Ks.20/- a bag of 1SS lbs, the price of flour to aporoxim.*.toly Jh.24/- for a bag of 140 lbs, and the price of wheat to approximately Fe.28/- a bag of 168 lbs. This will mean that these commodities will now be sold on the Trucial Coast at a more reasonable price than they have bocii during the last two years. The scheme is not, fonfined to Dubai and it is only bein^ financed from Dubai because the Dubai Foostuffs Company have had the sole handling of the surplus sugar.

The scheme 'vas introduced by th* FoodstuXTs Company at Tandy*3 su{ j gestion with my knowledge approval though I confess I did not anticipate that the results would bo profitable. However, if the Foodstuffs Company had not made this profit it would be main by individual merchants who would most certainly not have handed it over to b-* used for the bene fit of tha general public. The price of foodstuffs prior to tills reduction was such that the greot majority of the people were unable to purchase a full ration and if this method of subsidising sales h?.d not been adopted it would in my opinion have been necessary to ask x'or funds from the Government of India in the form of a subsidy.^i 2 © vJf No. ot VStt Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 17th Safar , 13 63 February 12, 1944 H. 3. M’s Political Agent, Bahrain* Memorandum:- I have received from Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Company, Ltd., Bahrain, debit notes for 950 tons of wheat from s.s.'Caithness' for which P.3.405/- per ton has been charged. The vessel discharged wheat direct from Australia therefore the price appears to be excessively high especially in view of the price of wheat ex s.s. Stevenson-Taylor', which was Rs*368/- ter ton, this wheat was shipped from Basra and presumably the cost included storage and handling charges. I should be grateful if an enquiry could be made from the U.K.C.C. as to whether there is not a mistake in the debit notes for this last shipment of wheat. If the s.s. 'Caithness” wheat is put on the market at cost orice it will have to be sold at Annas 13/3 per ruba (4 lbs). The Australian tanker wheat was sold at Annas 9/- per ruba. Either the Bahrain Govern ment will be compelled to subsidize the wheat or the public will have to pay what is to most of them a very high price. Adviser to the Government.

B. M's Political Agent, B a hr e i n. Dear Sir, 1 - We have to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. C/315 of 13th instant, and are surprised to note that M.W.T. have expressed great concern in the matter of discharging vessels at ports in the Persian Gulf, as they are well aware of the conditions here and at the other ports in Arab Sheikhdoms. In regard to Bahrein, the s.s.'Caithness’' is an example of the discharge of a large cargo, and the speed of discharge was governed by three factors. Firstly, tne weatner, wnich, as you know, was particularly bad during this vessel's stay, and considerably hampered the working of Craft alongside tne ship. Secondly, during this period, two vessels, the 'Nawab' and 'Mars' were also discharging and these vessels were given priority over the 'Caitnness' with M.W.T. agreement. Thirdly, the Banrein Customs were unable to remove the cargo from the pier as fast as we could place it along side and consequently the Craft couj-d not be unloaded as quickly as possible. These factors are applicable to any vessel calling at Banrein with similar cargoes. The other ports, Koweit, Dubai, Sharjah and Muscat are all, more or less, affected by the weather, particularly Dubai and Sharjah where it is absolutely impossible to work a ship in rougn weather and where there are, in any case, few boats all of which are small. The presence of other vessels in these ports which are not equipped to handle more tnan one or two Contd2 at a time, is also a decisive factor in the rate of discharge, and this too,applies in some respects to Bahrein where very considerable cargoes are now being handled. Everything possible, however, is being done to expedite the despatch of all vessels.: CPY. ^3 tfjl .’To. /250/29/433 1C th i 1 r‘ia ry, 1CC4. M.E.3.C., Baghdad. U.fC.C.C. , M.E.3.O.D.

Mr.G.V/.R.Smith, Food Controller. Shaikh Ebrahim bin Mohamed A1 Khalifah. Hajy Khalil bin Ebrahim Moayedh. Hajy Mohsin al Tajir. Hajy Ahmed al Tawil. Hajy Abdulrehman Abdulwahab Zayani. Hajy Khalil bin Ebrahim Kanoo. Hajy Mahmood Bushiri. Mr.Mohamed Saleh Shatter. Mr.Ahmed al Omran. The first item on the agenda was to discuss a suggestion put to the Committee in,writing, by Abdullah bin Rashid Zayani, a member of the Committee of Moharraq Municipality, to the effect that, as, in his opinion, the majority of ration card holders of the towns of Manama, Maharaq and Hedd, were not purchasing their ration of Flour and Barley, these commodities should be withdrawn from the rations and sold to public bakeries at annas 14 per ruba, so that the poor ^ people could then buy cheap bread more easily. Early in the lively discussion which followed, it was pointed out that the proposed withdrawal would not mean an increase in the wheat ration. Various suggestions were put forward all of which confirmed the fact that barley in its own form was not being utilised, and was not palalfeble. The Food Controller at this point advised the meeting that the Government still had on hand over 600 tons of Barley and that further shipments of this commodity were to be expected. In view of this the public would of necessity have to include this cereal in some form in their diet. Shaikh Ebrahim bin Mohamed al Khalifah then suggested that instead of the present ration of 4 lbs Flour (which includes mixed Barley Flour) 4 lbs Barley ^ 12 lbs Wheat, ^ a ration of 10 lbs flour and 10 lbs wheat could perhaps be issued. The 10 lbs of flour to consist of 4 lbs flour as at present issued, and mixed with the 4 lbs Barley and 2 lbs wheat milled into flour. This suggestion met with the general approval of the meeting, but the Food Controller advised that he did not think the available milling facilities in Bahrain could cope v/ith this extra burden,and it was therefore left in abeyance and the Food Controller promised to ascertain the total daily milling capacity, and arrange if possible to mill more barley into flour. The Food Controller then advised the meeting that a further three months quota of Sugar from India had been released to the Bahrain Government, and that it was believed that an increase of 25 tons monthly, which had previously been sanctioned, was included in this latest release.In that event, and after arrival of the sugar, the Government proposed to increase the ration to 3^r lbs per adult per month for Manama, Maharraq and Hedd and to 1 lb per adult per month for the vilD.ages. This met with universal approval. The meeting then discussed the distribution of foodstuffs in the villages, when it was divulged that the Government shop of Suq-al- Khamis No # l had to cater for almost double the number of rations than that of Suq-al-Khamis No.2 shop. To ensure a more equal division, it was decided to transfer from shop No.l to shop No 2. the rations for the village of Sanabis as from 1st Rabia al Awal. Hajy Khalil bin Ebrahim Moayedh than proposed that all holders of Piece Goods stocks should be allowed to ^ell piece goods for export in the form of barter, and not as at present^ #wily the Direct Impcrters/*^ It was pointed out that firstly, the importer, who usually goes to considerably more trouble and expense than the retailer, surely deserved more consideration, secondly, in the past by reason of uncontrolled _ sales to Persian Nacodas for barter, the General Public, who have first to be considered, were unable to purchase their requirements as all stocks were being held for sale for export at high prices. The present system in force prohibits this, and has already caused a fall in prices in the local market. The meeting agreed that the present system should remain. The next and last subject to be discussed was Dates., again at the request of Hajy Khalil bin Ebrahim al Moayedh. He requested that steps be taken to enable the public and in particular the poorer types, to purchase their requirements, as the holders of Bahrain Dates were refusing to sell their stocks. Hajy Khalil bin Ebrahim Kanoo advised that the reason for this withholding of stocks was that whilst good Marzaban Dates were re quired to be sold at Rs 8/- per galla, old stock Busreh dates were being sold at Rs 13.6.0 per retali. At this stage it was pointed out that the Government were selling by weight and not by retali and that the average price reached per re tali was abotit Rs 9/10 rupees, as all ^ the retails had lost weight due to the extraction of dibs, stacking etc. After a discussion it was decided to reduce the price of 194-2 Busreh dates by anna one per ruba as from 1st Rabia-al-Awal, this reduction to be recovered on the price of 194-3 Busreh dates. The public are being informed of this over the Radio and are being advised full particulars and that they may purchase any quantity.

The reason for this is that the milling faci lities are not capable by even half of absorbing 700 tons Flour and Barley and it is therefore suggested that all mills available, instead of milling for the Government, be made ^ available to the public at a controlled rate, a rate suf- ' ficient to cover running expenses and rent of mill. The public would then be in a position to mill their own proportions of flour, barley and/or wheat. To go further, this new allocation is also goin^ to raise again the cost of living as shown under All the above is in addition to the obvious deterioration in diets due to the big drop in the issues of the most edible c ommo d it y i e whe at, January Rations per Adult in Manama, Loharraq &amp; Hedd, February Allocation. 4 lbs Nixed Flour 4 lbs Barley 12 lbs Wheat li. 0.14.0 0 . 11.0 2. 4. 0 6 lbs Wheat Ra. 1. 2. 0 7 lbs Barley 1. 3. 0 7 lbs Flour 1.14. 0 mi. 3 . 13 . 0 The Villages will suffer even more and they represent a much poorer class of people.

The difficulties cf the last two months have made it clear that control of the distribution of cereals in the Persian Gulf from Cairo ic extroaely complicated. It inevitable that as long as control is centred in Cairo# the man on the spo spot, i.e.f Baghdad, become u post box and do not bear full responsibility for taking the necearary steps to ensure smooth distribution.- 2 - 2. It has often occurred during these last few weeks that H33C (L) Baghdad, has rung up this office wi th a suggestion or proposition and it has been quite impossible for us to give Ctrl aiswer owing uo the necessity of consulting MKBQD before arriving at any decision* This results in numerous telephone calls on an airQ^idy over-worked line to Bagdad, the line is often indistinct and there is a considerable danger of mis- und arstand iiig und c 'jnf u si on • down in This UK GO and within the be in a safety should have informa- 3* It is suggested that a programme should be laid Cairo on broad lines to cover the next six months* programme will be subject to periodic revision, but MBSC (1) Baghdad, should be given authority to work outlines of this programme* UK GO, Baghdad, should position to know what quantities be stored with at the various places in the Gulf, and also tion as to the s ce ckt. actually available in these places.

II. COTTON It was agreed on the suggestion of the Director of Customs that as there were at present 3,^03 bundles of cotton twist representing five years 1 supply in Bahrain 600 bundles should be retained for local use, 1,200 bundles should be exported as barter and the export of the remaining 1,403 bundles should be free. Of this latter figure Mohammed Jamal Khoonji would be permitted to export 500 bundles, Mohammed Taker Khonnji 500 bundles, and Haji Abdul Aziz All al Bassam 403 Bundles. III. LEATHER GOODS Mr. Tikamdas produced endorsements from the Export Trade Controller Bombay dated the 1st March 1944 to the effect that by his notice No.411 dated the 12th December 1943 the export of gents* footwear was completely prohibited. The Political Agent promised to telegraph to the Hon*ble the Political Resident immediately. The export of ladies* and children*s footwear was however permitted. IV. CIVIL REwJli-lBEENlS (2nd Quarter) The Political Agent stated that so far no allocations have been received from the Government of India for the April to June civil requirements. V. SHIPMENTS FROM U.K. Mr. Hussain Yateem promised to give the Political ^gent a telegram which he had received from the United Kingdom saying that shipping space to Bahrain was not available but that shipping space via Basra was available. If goods are sent via Basra there would undoubtedly be trouble with regard to their re-export. The Political Agent said that he would do his best to obtain shipping space for Bahrain via India. VI. PIECEGOQDS FROM U.K. &lt;1 RE-EKTC..T Of BETTERJES A member raised the question of the export of piecegoods from the United Kingdom and it was decided that tonnage which had now been allocated to heads like **paint*' of which supplies were not forthcoming should be re-allocated to piecegoods. It was the opinion of the meeting that all persons importing batteries from countries other than India should be permitted to export a maximum of 1/3. If batteries were available in Bahrain and the number surplus to requirements was greater than 1/3 then the percentage for re-export would be proportionately increased. Bahrain, 26-3-&lt;x4.A meeting of the Food Control Committee was held at the Adviserate on Wednesday the 29th March 1944, at 3.0 A.M., the following were present: II.E. Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa A1 Khalifah, C.I.E., Mr.C.DalrymjxLe Belgrave, C.B.E., Adviser to the Govt. Mr.G.W.R.Smith, Food Controller. Hajy Khalil bin Ebrahim Foayfedh. Hajy Mohsin al Tajir. Hajy Ahmed al Tawil. Hajy Abdulrehman Abdulwahab Zayani. Ha jy Khalil bin Ebrahim Kanoo. Ha j y Maiunood Bushiri. Mr. Mohamed Saleh Shatter. Mr. Ahmed al Omran. The Food Controller advised the meeting that he wished, to fix the price of New Season (1943) Busreh Dates and that the cost to the Government of the dates so far secured,both from Busreh and purchases locally; was Rs 13/12/ per retali. He therefore proposed to fix^the price at Rs 14/- per retali, and at annas 13/-* per ruba for retail sa3.e This price would ensure the retailers a profit of annas 10/- per basket or anproximately 57^* The meeting agreed to this. The question of old stock Busreh Dates was then raised-^the Government still hold upwards of Rs 3^ a k:hs of these dates, which are being at present retailed at annas 10/- per ruba, representing a loss to the Government. With a view however, to minimising any further large loss due to the marketing of'new dates at annas 13 / per ruba, it was proposed to reduce the price of old dates to annas 8/- per ruba- a price at which it was felt- the poorer people would rather nay than annas 13 /- for new dates. This latter proposal is however subject to the approval of His Highness The Ruler- and the Adviser is putting the case before him for an early decision. The Food Controller then advised the meeting that the Government had obtained a quantity of rice from Iraq,which would allow of the undernoted rations for the next three months commencing 1st Jamad al Awel C/W 24th April 1944,for all classes of the entire Island. Jamad al Awal ... 3 ^'bs per adult Jamad al Thany ... 3. It was further pointed out that the price of this rice was likely to be high- at present it was not known how much the cost would' be, and that it might be fairer to apportion the rations as urd er • For Manamah, Maharaq and Hedd 4 lbs per adult for Jamad a1 Awal and Jamad al Thany and 2 lbs -Tor Rajah, whilst for the villages 1 : lbs each for the three months concerned. T ho reason being that if the price was beyond the means of many of the village* they would sell si fa profit in the black market^ After a general discussion it was however decided to make the ration the same for all as originally mentioned 31 bs, 3 lbs, and 2 / lbs cer adult. Hajv Khalil bin Ebrahim Moayedh then proposed that all holders of Piece Goods should be allowed to sell to Persian Fakhudhas for export, instead of as at present, the Direct Importers only.The Food Controller pointed out that when the system Hajy Khalil proposed be reinstated, v/as in force, the public v/ere not able able to obtain their requirements, as holders v/ere always out of stock to residents, holding everything for sales at high prices for export. The Food Controller further mentioned that at present there were no complaints from importers of essentials such as cattle, sheep, potatoes, charcoal, etc against the present system, in fact, imports were on the increase, and that in View of this- Vie proposed there be no change. The me'ting v/ere in agreement v/ith this, with of course the exception of Haiy Khalil al Moayedh.

'hness the Ruler, Ire ;irst item discussed, \ as the present prices of neat, tro Food Controller advising the'meeting that large numbers of Goats and Sheep had been and were still arriving and were being sold at prices ranging from K 2&gt;/ to 35/” por pair. \ These prices were giving the butchers upwards of 5Of* profit on current retail prices, and the Food Contro]ler proposed a suitable r edue t ion be rna de . After a general discussion during which several prices were suggested, the Food Controller proposed the following reductions which were approved of by the meeting. Beef from K 3/- to K 2/8/0 per ruba. Hutton ' n 3/8/- to m 3/” !! Goat Beat ' 3/8/- to K 2/12/- Piece Goods was the next subject under discussion.

The reason for this was attributed to the following causes: ^ A) The long interval between arrivals of Fresh Stocks. B) Direct Importers stocks or Barter goods ck-indling, lend in; hope to speculators of their being forced into the local market to' obtain their requirements. * C) The opening up again of barter sales to all and sundry. In this connection the Food Controller proposed to the meeting that all holders of piece goods stocks exceeding in value k other than Direct Importers, be allowed to dispose of l/3rd of their stock for barter, provided they first sold to the Government whe remaining 2/^rd• of their stock at controlled rates* m he concencus of opinion of the meeting after a general r isc^ssior was. that holders woulAnot 8|;ree to this- they hovever requested that an Elan to this effect bo issued, and the results comrmnieated them in due course.4 The meeting closed et 11.30./'-.’ . ensure s fair distribution to all in future- the Food Controller advised the meeting hiV intention of tailing over on behalf of the Govern ment 2/3 rd of all fresh arrivals 5 instead of at present l/3^ ri - 0 - ri —-F* l/ 3 rd would be rold as usual to the poor classes at over cost- l/3rd to the Genera]- pubj.ic at 25/^ over cost, the remaining l/ 3 rd to be sold for barter.

Memorandum : Reference your memorandum No.C/652 dated the 19th April 1944. An examination of the ration cards now in circula tion has revealed the following figures which show that the majority of the population when applying for ration cards entered children as adults. Doubtless at the tine of the Census, when people imagined that they were required for military service, they described adults in many cases as minors. Adults. Minors. Total. Man amah. 37,450 680 37,790 Muharraq. 20,188 293 20 ,334J Hedd. 3,870 60 3,900 Villages. 32.349 417 32.557- 93.857 1,450 e discussed this matter at length with the Director of Customs and the municipal secretaries, on whom most of the work of issuing ration cards has fallen. It is difficult to know how to adjust the proportion of adults and minors except by holding another Census, and this can only be done in the Autumn, after the diving season. I am inclined to think it would be desirable toehold a second census for various reasons. The work will be considerably simplified now that it has once been done and it should be possible to obtain more details than were demanded in 1941. It would be interesting to know what, in other countries, is the proportion of children under 12 years per cent of the total population. c &amp; / S Adviser to the Government.

A reference to the minutes of the Food Control Co/iimittee meeting held on the 29th of March show that the rice ration was to be issued to adults only. If we are to take the first reference 94,582 adult rations were issued if we are to take the second reference 94,000 full rations v.’ere issued,from which must be subtracted half the number of minors, and if wo ore to take the figures quoted in your memorandum P Ko.982-50 SF of Kny IVtfi the figures will be 93,857.

I regret I am unable to give you any information with ^ regard to the proportion of adults and minors in other countries but I have no doubt that there are various reference books from which this knowledge can be gleaned. 3. It is quite obvious from the figures which you have given me that a very grave and successful attempt has been made by a large number of people to mis-represent the ages of the members of their families with a view to obtaining additional rations by false pretences. I presume that steps have already been taken to verify the accuracy of the statements made by persons applying for ration cards. If however this has in fact not been done I suggest that three committees be ^ appointed immediately for the municipal areas of Maharraq, Manama, and the outlying villages, to verify all ration cards. These committees v/ill probably take several weeks to complete their investigations but provided the members are chosen with care their time will be v-^ell spent.

In the unavoidable absence of H.E. Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa Al Khalifah, C.I.E., the Adviser presided over the meeting. The Adviser opened the meeting by bringing to the notice of the members, the huge discrepancy in the figures of minors as disclosed by an inspection of the ration cards, as opposed to those obtained through the census. At the present moment only 1450 minors had been declared by ration card holders; an obvious underestimate, and done with a view to obtain more rations. Ways and means to correct this and obtain an accurate figure of minors in Bahrain, were discussed at length, but it was obvious that members themselves were loth to make any change at present, all making the point that minors from the age of seven upv/ards ate more than adults. The Food Controller pointed out that it was not so much the question of reducing rations as the necessity to the Government of having accurate figures- as, although there was no indication of a reduction in our monthly quota at present - the possibility existed for the future. He further pointed out that with the existing quota and accurate figures it might even be possible to give adults a larger ration. A lengthy discussion ensued, the sum and substance of v;hich was that the members did not consider at this particular time- what with the Pearling Season - the fear of perhaps conscription - that accurate details could be obtained - they did however agree that a census would be a good thing after the pearling season. As a commencement in the right track however, it was decided to issue an order to the effect that all births and deaths were to be advised the Municipalities. Similarly all arrivals and departures from Bahrain were to be advised the Municipalities - as in the month of Jamad al Awal- over 200 temporary rations cards had been issued to visitors- some to enter hospitals, others for business purposes etc, and it was deemed advisable to keep track of their movements, so that on departure- unauthorised persons could not avail themselves of the ration cards, so issued. The Food Controlled ndxt advised the meeting that as from 15th Jamad al Thani C/tf 6th^'«fune, 1944, the Government had decided to reduce the price of Busreh Dates from Rs 14/- per basket to Rs 12-4-0. Retailers to sell at annas eleven and pies six per ruba. Old season dates which were at present being retailed at annas eight per ruba would also be reduced, as from 15th Jamad al Thani to annas six per ruba. This met with universal approval and the members thanked the Government for this action.j -2- At this stage the Adviser asked the meeting for their views on a proposal that for season 194-4- the Government should buy up all sur plus Bahrain crop dates. By surplus- this means after the growers have retained sufficient for their own house consumption. The meeting were unanimous in their agreement with this and the Adviser promised to take this matter up with K.H. the Ruler. As Bahrain dates constitute about l/3rd of annual requirements - if this is successful - the necessity for buying such large quantities from Busreh as in 194-3 and 194-4 would not arise c ... merchants would in all probablity be able to import the balance of the Country 1 s requirements. A member then pointed out that a certain amount of hard feeling had arisen in certain villages over the increased sugar ration granted to the inhabitants of Hedd, Galali, Busaiteen, Halat al Naim, and Halat Sulata. In view of the fact that present stocks and quota, coupled with the extra requirements for barter, now that piece goods were forbidden, did not alloy; for a general increase, after a discussion it was decided that with effect from 1st Rajah 1363 5 C/W 22nd June, the rations for Hedd and Galali etc would revert to their previous basis, ie Hedd 1 lb per adult, and Galali etc *&gt;- lb per head as in other villages. The Food Controller then drew the attention of the meeting to the proposal put forward by him at a previous meeting held on the 16 th February, 1944, wherein the Government h s d proposed to increase the sugar ration to 3 n lbs per head, for residents of tlanamah, Haharaq and Hedd, and to 1 lb for the villages after the arrival of the in creased quota. With the cancellation of the export of piece goods- and the issu ance of extra ^ sugar for barter purposes, it had not been possible to do this, but if Bahrain could obtain a further 20 tons of sugar per month this proposal could be carried out. The meeting agreed that if possible this should be done and the Adviser was asked to enlist the aid of II.B.M 1 s Political Agent with a view to obtaining an increase of 20 tons per month bringing the total monthly quota up to 165 tons. The Food Controller next advised the meeting that he had received complaints from several importing nakhudhas re the low prices obtained .J tliem J - or liye stock and that on an examination of these prices - it was revealed that local butchers were profiting to the detriment of the importers. „ A s that every encouragement be given to importer^ oi live shocks- the Food Controller asked that steps be taken to ensure unat ram prices - in line with retail control prices be paid to importers. * After a very lively discussion it was decided that in future and commencing immediately all live stoclc ( sheep, goats &amp; cattle oxen etn'l imported into Bahrain would be sold by auctioA by the owners IndtL^ Baladeyh broker - under supervision by the Baladeyh. liaiiaraq Inf Hedd. qUantlt 163 ” f ° r aUCti ° n W0Uld be available ^ \I -3- That any person wishing to be a butcher could do so on application to the Municipality o:P the area in which he resided.

No live animal to be sold by butchers without permission of the Baladeyhs. The shortage of piece goods and the alleged inability of poor people to obtain their requirements was raised by Hajy Khalil bin Ebrahim al Moayedh. Various suggestions were put forward by members - but the Food Controller pointed out that as existing Government stocks were in sufficient to meet all requirements - he suggested that on the arrival of fresh supplies - he then mentioned that over 100 tons were awaiting shipment in India, and that assistance had been sought through the good offices of the Political Agent- to obtain shipping space - the ^ Government purchase from importers sufficient to give each member of - the public 4 yards of material. The suggestion or proposal met with approval® A complaint against the Government shopkeeper at Suq-al-Khamis No.l by three residents of Bilad al Khadim was then read to the meeting. The complaint alleged that the shopkeeper demanded money from ration card holders prior to their receiving rations and is being investigated. The meeting ended at 1.20. P.M.UoJ^ yj~ no.

Price Control There was a general discussion on the subject of price levels and the Political Agent stated that prices should be such as to reasonably compensate khx importers for the trouble which they had taken to obtain their merchandise and au the same time be fair to the general public. He was not in favour of further price control as the practical difficulties m the way of enforcing controlled prices were enormous. Ke told the members of the meeting that black market prices were high simply and solely because the members of the public refused to cooperate and inform the Bahrain Government or the Agency of breaches of the control regulations. Unless the general public were prepared to cooperate with the local government there was no hope of boring able to keep prices at J a reasonable level. Some of the merchants pr-esent pointed out that much as they would like to be cooperative they found it very difficult to inform about their fellow traders as the whole of their social life would probably be affected for some time to come. Refusal by merchants to sell articles in stock A merchant stated that some dealers were refusing to sell goods which they imported with the assistance of the Agency. It was suggested that the Modern Art, Studio who had recently received 8G0 electric globes would certainly refuse to sell to the general public but would reserve their globes for private trading and for the personal friends of the manage ment. The Political Agent promised that this question should be investigated immediately. -Imports of pieccgoods from U.S.A. ^ It was suggested that merchants x&amp;Ki might like to increase their orders for piecegoods from America and intending at the Agency on Monday the 5th Juimporters were advised to get in touch with the Assistant Political Agent who would explain the new regulations to them. 5. hotor car spare parts Haji Khalil Kanoo enquired whether any further action had been taken about the import of spare parts for motor cars.

The meeting was called to discuss the meat situation, as the arrangements made at the Food Control meeting held on Wednesday the 31st of May, Y/hereby:- 1. All live stock (sheep, goats and cows, oxen etc) imported into Bahrain must be sold in auction by their owners and the Baladeyh Dalai (broker) under the supervision of the Baladeyh. 2. The butchers of Maharaq and Hedd can buy up to ^ of the amount of the live stock imported. 3. Any one wishing to be a butcher may do so on application and against a license from the Manamah Municipality if from Manamah, and from Maharaq Municipality if from Maharaq or Hedd. 4. Butchers can purchase any amount of cattle, no equal or limited division. 5. Butchers must slaughter and sell cattle to public at rates fixed by the Food Control Department. No live animal may be sold by butchers without a permit from the Baladeyh. had not been successful and many complaints by Persian Nakhudhas had been received by the Food Controller, against the delay they experienced and the loss suffered in disposing of the live stock imported by them. It was thus necessary to take immediate steps to ensure the speedy sale of live stock - at date over 1300 sheep and goats remained unsold. After a general discussion in which several proposals were made and rejected, the Food Controller proposed that with immediate effect the retail prices of Beef Goat meat and mutton should be reduced to: Beef Rs 2/- per ruba of 4 lbs. Goat meat Rs 2-4-0 per ruba of 4 lbs. Mutton Rs 2-8-0 per ruba of 4 lbs but that wholesale purchase prices by the butchers should be as under Goats per nair from Rs25/- &amp; upwards according to weight. Sheep '' *' ' Rs 35/- fi ' ' ' ' Cattle RsoO/ per head &amp; upwards ' ' . Butchers refusing to pay these prices would lose their licenses and in the event of no butchers purchasing, the respective Baladeyhs would purchase and retail to the public at controlled rates.Several members suggested that this proposal be put to the butchers for their views and accordingly at the conclusion of the meeting at 11.20 A.11. The Food Controller, Hajy Khalil Kanoo, and the Secretaries of the Baladeyhs had a meeting with the butchers of Manamah and Maharac, explained the position to them and asked them to appoint a representst^ to the Inspection Committee. The butchers agreed to the proposals and appointed Haj Abdullah Ebrahim of Manamah and Abdullah Burgus of Haharaq as their represent atives.J7/3 ^ (g) Tlinutcs of the Merchants Advisory ^onmittee Meeting held at the Agency on 12th June 1944 (Present as usual) 1 Leath er Goods The members were j he Government of India had now appointed a large number of esta blished shippers as exporters for shoes and sandals.

CUlIXxaXQQj . % Agents, U.K.C.C..A meeting of the Food Control Committee was held at the Adviserate on Tuesday the 11th July, 194-4, and in view of the importance of the subject to be discussed- His Highness Shaikh Sir Sulman bin Hamad A1 Khalifah, K.C.I.E., etc, presided. The following were also present: H.H. Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa Al Khalifah, C.I.E., Hr. C. Dalrymple Belgrave, C.B.E., Adviser to the Government. Ir. G.H.R. Smith, Food Controller.

Hajy Ma timo od Bush ir i. Hr. llohamed Saleh Shatter. Mr. Ahmedal Omr a n. His Highness explained to the meeting that the subject he wished to discuss was the question of Bahrain's quota of dates from Busreh for this season’s crop. He pointed out that in the event of the Government obtaining a quota, guaranties would have to be given to purchase the entire quota.and to refuse to purchase any other dates which might be offered in the port. In view of the fact that for two years now the Bahrain Government had accepted a quota,and purchased their dates through the Concession aires, Messrs Andrew V/e ir H Co, at prices which were invariably consider ably higher - especially towards the end of the seasons, v/hen' cheaper dates had been offered in large quantities in the port, His Highness was averse to entering into any contract this year. He further pointed out that at the present rate of consumption of imported dates - the Government held sufficient stocks of Busreh dates for a further year, and this,coupled with the controlling of prices for the current seasons local crop,would ensure an adequate supply of dates for all till next season’s 1945 crop. After a general discussion,it was unanimously decided that no quotas of Busreh dates would be asked for, for 1944, that the prices of Bahrain dates would be controlled, and that the Government would purchase any surplus local dates from growers after they had taken their home re-' cuirenents- should they so desire to sell. The next subject under discussion was tho cancellation by the Food Controller of the licences of four prominent local butchers, who had been hoarding their purchases of live stock,and only slaughtering a minimum quantity for sale to the public. It was felt that a consider able quantity of live stock had been moved out into the villages to be held for a possible rise in prices during the month of Ramadhan. After a lively discussion, and to this practice, it was decided that the Baladeyh should open an account for every butcher; check on his daily purehases, and the quantities slaughtered,and thus be in a position to know exactly how much live stock was available. In this instance, the Secretary of the kanamah Municipality was instructed by His Highness to return the licences to the four butchers, but His Highness asked the Secretary to make it clear to the men con cerned, that He approved of the action taken, and that should a similar case occur a second time, stronger action would be taken against them or any other butchers who infringed the Government rules arient the sale of meat.-2- .1 Ha jy IQialil bin Ebrahim al Mosyedh then mentioned that he had received complaints iron certain persons tha o they rrere not getting their full rations, in other words, instead of 20 lbs - the shopkeepers - ~ ' ’’ ‘ling the surplus, sir'ilarly that the noor 4 yards of cloth -were •.ore giving 18 or 19 lbs onl^ and ^ sell! certain shopkeepers, instead of giving selling three yards only, retaining the ^ourtn yard i or person&lt;ai gaa-_^« / _ After a general discussion, an Ehlan is being issued from die Office of the Food Controller, reminding the. public that they are entitled to 20 lbs of cereals, and i hen available 4 yards of clotn,ana they are being requested to check the weights and measurements cat -he time of purchs.se.

Mr. Ahmed al Omran. .M.l The Food Controller advised the meeting that they had been called to discuss the meat and fish position, both of which had been steadily deteriorating. The Food Controller further pointed out that he was quite aware that the majority of the meeting were^ of the opinion that the remedy lay in the increasing of retail prices, but said that that was the easy way out. For a considerable number of years now local butchers had been a constant cause of trouble to the public, by profiteering, re fusing to buy, kill and sell when they were of the opinion that the profit to themselves was insufficient. It was high time, that strong measures were taken to curtail the activities of these gentlemen, and to set in motion a system whereby the general public would be able to purchase a regular supp y of meat at regular prices. Considerable thought has been given to this problem and careful calculations as to prices paid to importers, this is important as every inducement must be given to Persian Nakhudhas so fnat necessary supplies are brought forward. After careful consideration the Food Controller made the following recommendations: That the Government supply the Manamah Municipality with sufficient funds to enable them purchase all future imports of live stocks at prices to be agreed between them and the importers. Maximum prices to be paid were however set at: Cattle at no more than Rs 100/- per head; Goats ' “ ' ' Rs 30/- per pair; Sheep ' ' ' ' Rs 40/- per pair. In addition to the prices obtained by the importers they will be given permission to purchase and export Sugar and Tea to the value of their imports and in the following ratios: 50$ in Sugar @ Rs250/- per bag; 50$ in Tea @ not exceeding Rs2/- per lb. Having obtained all available live stocks through the medium of the Municipality, the Government will then engage 20 qualified butchers on a monthly salaried basis who will kill and sell to the public at the under-noted rates:- BEEF GOAT MEAT MUTTON not exceeding Rs2- 4-0 per ruba; n M Rs2- 8-0 per ruba; ' ' Rs2-12-0 per ruba©-2- © The butchers at present practising under license will be given an opportunity should ^the y desir e to wor k on a salaried basis. The next subject under discussion was that of fish. It was felt that at the present controlled price of Rsl/- per ruba the majority of the fish caught was not reaching the market, but was being so-d in the villages at higher prices. After a increases: general discussion it was decided to make the following per ruba 5 n 11 Large Fresh Fish not exceeding Rs 1-3-0 Fresh Prawns u &amp; 1-3-0 Small Fresh Fish ' ” &amp; 1-0-^ Dried Prawns ' ' &amp; 2-0-0 Salt Fish ' ' &amp; 2-0-0 2 o In the case of dried prawns and salt fish which had been sold at prices ranging at Rs5/~ per ruba, it was felt advisable to make drastic reduction down to Rs2/- per ruba. This would then 3is courage the present practice of retailers drying and salting the majority of the prawns and fish purchased by them. The meeting closed at ll.A.M. #31 ? No. 1742-13/1.

Mr« C. DaIrymple BeIgrave, C.B.E., Adviser to the Govt. M G.V/.R. Smith, Food Controller. Shaikh Ebrahim bin Mohammed A1 Ehalifah. Hajy Mohsin al Tajir. Hajy Ahmed al Tawil.

Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa Al Kha^itah, C.I.E., the Adviser presided over the meeting. The Food Controller opened the proceedings by drawing the attention of the Committee to the present prices being charged and obtained by sellers of Eggs, ie from Ps 1.12,0 to Ps 2.4.0 per dozen - against the controlled rate of Rs 1 . 2.0 per dozen. He further advised the meeting that Eggs from Persia were begining to arrive in quantity now that the weather was cooler, and were being wholesaled @ Rs I 060 O per dozen in accordance ¥/ith Food Control Elan No.208/62 dated the l/th November 1043- but.were not always being retailed @ Rs 3.8.0. The Food Controller then asked the members for their views on the subject, with a view to arriving at a suitable arrangement v/hereby this commodity be adequately controlled*and a leng#4y dis cussion followed •y^^variojis members, from which it was finally agreed to increase prices.as under: Bahrain Fresh Eggs purchased from house to house by retailers ^ Es 1.14.0 per doz. •Bahrain Fresh Eggs sold by retailers in the marKet @ Pi 2 . 2.0 per doz. Imnorted Eggs from Persia (?) Hs 1.6.0 per dozen to the importer and Pi 1.8,0 to the retailer. To ensure that imported Eggs were not mixed with local Eggs and sold at the higher prices- the Food Controller proposed that imported Eggs be retailed only in the Meat Market on the days on which meat was not sold and under the supervision of the Baladeyh A.uthorities. This would also ensure that the controlled rate v/as adhered to, and to this suggestion, the meeting agreed. The next subject to be discussed was dates, and the Adviser informed members that the Government still held 65,000 baskets of 1943 crop Busreh dates. On the 1st October 1944 the Government reduced the price of these dates from Fi 12.4.0 to Ps 6 /- per basket, ano u? ^to date sales since then have been hardly 2000 bas! ets, admittedly the 14.000odd baskets of 1942 crop @ .1 2 /- have been sold curing tons period . The Adviser nointed out, that he felt teat purchasers /ere holdinr back waiting for the Government to withdraw the ban m imports of dates, but he could scarcely recommend this action in view of the large stocks still held, but he was noweyer prepared to make a further reduction to Rs 5/- P e r basket, anc-2- zn- @ and reviev/ the position again at the begining of 1945- The rnemberV ^ thanked the Government for this action. Hajy Khalil Kanoo then asked that Fire-wood be price controlled but the majority of members preferred that this commodity be left uncontrolled, as prices fluctuated with the supply and demand but had never risen out of all proportion.

The supply and distribution of staple foods such as rice, wheat, barley, flour, sugar, tea and coffee to the population of Bahrain are discussed and to a lesser extent, other essential commodities for domestic consumption, such as cotton piece goods for clothing. The bulk of the correspondence is between the Political Agent, Bahrain and Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain. They regularly exchange information about Bahrain Government measures to ensure the fair distribution of rationed goods, prevent starvation and other deprivations among the population and curb profiteering and smuggling. The topics they discuss include import quotas, cost estimates, stock levels, sale and distribution under rationing arrangements and retail price controls. Also mentioned are the hardships experienced in the Trucial Coast shaikhdoms, owing to the same war-time shortages and restrictions on trade and shipping in the Persian Gulf imposed by the Government of India.The file includes records of the meetings of the Bahrain Government’s Food Control Committee and also the Political Agent’s Commercial Advisory Committee and Merchants’ Advisory Committee. There are comprehensive notes by the Bahrain Government’s Adviser and Food Controller respectively, about rationing and price control in Bahrain, including sample ration cards (folios 18-29, 106-108). Similarly, there are comprehensive notes by the Political Agent, Bahrain about a visit from the Representative of the Middle East Supply Committee (folios 109-118), a meeting with the Representative of the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation, Baghdad (folios 126-129) and the supply and distribution of cereals at Bahrain and on the Trucial Coast (folios 153-154). The latter notes were compiled in response to a report from the Assistant Director, Food Supplies at the Middle East Supply Centre in Cairo (folios 141-143, 166-168). The several Arabic documents in the file include a few Bahrain Government public notices about food rations, issued by the Food Controller (folios 35, 44, 79), a petition from Persian nakhudas (ships’ captains) to the Political Agent, Bahrain complaining that Bahrain Customs officials denied them access to food supplies while at moorings in Bahrain Port (folio 10) and the correspondence of the Political Agent, Bahrain with the Ruler of Qatar and two commercial agents in Bombay appointed to resolve difficulties in shipping cargo to Bahrain, Qatar and the Trucial Coast shaikhdoms (folios 248-250, 254, 266, 267).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency, Merchants Advisory Committee</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Bahrain, Food Control Committee</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency, Commercial Advisory Committee</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Food prices</topic></subject><subject><topic>Food rationing</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000b3#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
