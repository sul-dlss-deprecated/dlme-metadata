The file contains a series of letters exchanged between the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat (Major Frederick Charles Leslie Chauncy) and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] regarding the precise wording of the English text of the treaty. The remaining correspondence, which is mostly between the Political Agent and the Foreign Office, concerns proposed amendments to drafts of the treaty. Other related matters of discussion include the following: the question of whether the Sultan will agree to allow the British to retain their 'extra-territorial privileges' in Muscat (i.e. jurisdiction over nationals from other British territories); whether the new treaty should cover consuls and consular functions; the duration of the new treaty, with the Foreign Office preferring a minimum of twelve years; the possibility of prolonging the existing treaty until 31 December 1951.Also included is a draft of the proposed new treaty (ff 93-103). The Arabic language material consists of the aforementioned correspondence between the Political Agent and the Sultan (English translations are included).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Muscat (1951)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Muscat (1939)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Consular services</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000024#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000024#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000024#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
