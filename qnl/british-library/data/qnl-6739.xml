Sultan's Commercial Treaties.—The situation at Muskat is governed by the fact that the Sultan has com- * Superseding an earlier treaty of n - ierc i a l treaties with the United States 1839 - (1833), France (1844), and Great Britain (1891 :i: '), the terms of which require amendment before be can place special restrictions on the trade in arms to and from his territory. There is also a Dutch 4&lt; Commercial Declaration ' of 1877, which merely provides for reciprocal ' most-favoured-nation ' treatment between the two countries. The American, French, and British treaties [see Appendices] provide expressly for the unrestricted import and export of all kinds of merchandise (with certain specified exceptions). The Sultan's international position is further regulated by the joint Anglo-French Declaration of 1862 by which the two Govern ments undertook reciprocally to respect His Highness's independence, which it should also be our object to get rid of. 2. Prohibition of Arms Traffic in Persian Gulf.—Elsewhere on the Persian Gulf littoral a general prohibition of the arms traffic is in force. The import of arms into Persia was prohibited by a Decree of IbSl (re-affirmed by a law of 1900). In 1897 the Persian Government authorised British ships to seize and confiscate arms destined for Persian ports. Agreements pro hibiting the trade in their respective territories, and conferring powers of search, &amp;c., on British ships, were concluded with Bahrein (1898), Koweit (1900), and the Trucial Chiefs (1902), The import of arms into Turkey is also prohibited. In 1898 the Sultan of Muskat agreed to prohibit the export of arms from Muskat to India and Persia (where the import of arms was illegal), and empowered British ships to act on his behalf in enforcing this prohibition. But (1) the import of arms into Muskat, and (2) their export except to the two specified countries, remain unprohibited. 3. State of the Traffic at Muskat.—The result has been to make Muskat the principal emporium of arms for the whole Middle East, rifles and ammunition being imported thither from Europe in large quantities, and thence dis tributed throughout the Gulf littoral. The bulk of these arms are smuggled across from Muskat to the coast of Persian Mekran, whence thej are taken up country by Afghan caravans and ultimately reach the tribesmen of Afghanistan and the North-Western Frontier of India. The Persian authorities have shown themselves quite incapable of checking the traffic in Persian territory. The following tables illustrate the extent of the import trade at Muskat : — I.—Rifles imported into Maskat. * Of Belgian manufacture ,, French ,, „ English „ German ,, ,, Roumanian ,, Total 1906-07. 1907-08. 1908-09. 24,196 45,370 43,280 3,725 6,280 4,230 17,006 30,800 25,600 — 5,230 6,550 — — 6,160 44,927 87,680 85,820 S. 53.

Effect on the Indian Frontier.—The wholesale arming of tribesmen with modern weapons (to which the Muskat trade has Jed) has produced grave results on the 'North-West Frontier of India, where, in the opinion of the Government of India, a situation has arisen ' which has upset the ' balance of power, and constitutes a serious menace to the maintenance of 44 peace.' Upwards of a quarter of a million sterling has been spent in pre ventive measures, which, while reducing the extent of the traffic, as shown by the figures given above, have proved that, until it is checked at the source, i.e., Muskat, the evil cannot be coped with effectively except at a prohibitive cost. 5. Negotiations with France.—His Majesty's Government have more than once attempted, by diplomatic means, to obtain a ' free hand ' at Muskat for the suppression of the arms traffic. At the Brussels Arms Conference of 1908-09 both the Dutch and American delegates expressed their readiness to forego their treaty rights in this respect, provided the other treaty powers did the same. But negotiations between Great Britain and France, with the object of obtaining a similar concession from the latter, broke down, and the Conference separated on the 31st December 1909 without any settlement being reached in regard to Muskat. Proposals for a temporary prohibition of the import of arms into Muskat, pending the permanent settlement of the question, were made to the French Government in April 1910, but, so far, they have iDeen without result. 6. French share of Traffic.--It may be observed that France's share in the import trade in arms and ammunition has been inconsiderable; but the distributing trade at Muskat itself is, or was, largely in the hands of local French dealers. The most important of these dealers, M. Goguyer, who died in October 1909, was understood to have powerful interests at his back, which made it difficult for the French Government to interfere with him. The effect of the naval blockade, which has been in operation since January 1910, has been that within the last, few months the other firms have closed their doors, and that of Goguyer alone survives. 7. Question of Territorial Concessions in India.—As regards the quid pro quo to be offered by His Majesty's Government in return for the renunciation by France of her rights under the Treaty of 184*1 and the Declaration of 18G2, the Government of India are prepared to cede to France territory in the neighbourhood of Pondicherry covering an area of 138 square miles, with a population of 195,000, yielding an annual revenue of about 2 J lakhs (18,333L), on condition that the other French settlements in India (including Chander- nagore), which cover about 88 square miles, and have a population of 99,000, are ceded to Great Britain. They deprecate, however, the cession to France of any territory in India except as part of an exchange which would include the surrender to Great Britain of Chandernagore (a dangerous centre of sedition) and the scattered loges (in which the French have no territorial rights, and the value of which, at 20 years' purchase, has been put at Rs. 85,000 —5,66GL). It should be added that, the question of an exchange of territory in India between Great Britain and France was raised in 1857, the proposal being then made that France should cede all her Indian possessions, exceptPondicherry and Karikal, iu return for an increase of French territory round Pondicherry. Negotiations on this subject, after dragging on for some years seem to have died a natural death. The area which it was proposed to cede cannot now be identified. 8. Question of Extradition. —In any negotiations with France advantage might 'be taken of the desire, which the French Government are understood to entcitain, ioi a modification of the present extradition arrangements under which the authorities of the French Settlements in India are bound to surrender to the British authorities any French citizen whose extradition is demanded for offences committed in British territory, on the mere production of the warrant of arrest (Article Oof the Extradition Treaty of 1815 and 16 of the Treaty of 1876). * ' IJiis question has not been lormally raised Ijy the French Government but a pledge was given by M. Pichon in the French Senate on 8th July 1909 that he would approach the British Government in the matter. 9. Pondicherry-Cuddalore (Tiruppappuliyur) Railway.— The French have for some years been anxious to build a railway connecting these two places, / but the Madras Government have objected to their proposals, which involved construction and working under French regulations of a line which must traverse British territory (though only for J mile) and be connected with the Bntish Indian iail\\a\ system. It is possible that there is material for a deal here. 10. Question of Compensation. —As has already been pointed out, the French manufacturing interest in the Muskat trade is not large. As regards the question of paying compensation for losses consequent upon the prohibition of the traffic, the Government of India recently (30th Januai} 1911) expiessed the view that provided arrangements are ' made under which Sultan can prohibit imports, it would be cheaper to buy •' up all stocks of arms at the market price than to maintain blockade which '' ^ ou ld be necessary if the export of existing stocks is to be prevented. ' ^his is the only form of direct compensation which should be entertained | ' If we begin discussing compensation to traders or manufacturers or loss of ' ' prospective profits we should be embarking on a very large question in ^ connection with which Muskat and British dealers, and even German and ;; Belgian manufacturers, might clamour for equal treatment. We should ' ado Pt argument that although shipment has been legal destination of arms '' lias been notoriously illicit, and that both dealers and manufacturers who ha\e ahead} made such heavy profits are deserving of no sympathy As regards agreement which Sultan is believed to have entered into with cf itam of the dealeis authorising them to import arms for a specified term ' of years, I think we could refuse to recognise them and leave persons ' concerned to get what redress they can from the Sultan.' The firm of Goguyer, as has been said above, is the only French firm now left at Muskat. But, as was stated in Sir R. Ritchie's letter to the Foreign Office, dated the 3rd February 1911, recent customs returns show that there has been a marked increase in shipments of arms to Muskat; and it is to be feared that, if negotiations are protracted, and especially if the idea gets abroad that His Majesty's Government are likely to pay direct compensation, the market will be Hooded with arms, &amp;c., which we may find ourselves obliged to purchase. It was therefore suggested that the date on which negotiations with France are resumed should be fixed as thelatesi v limit of time beyond which His Majesty's Government will not recognise any imports into Muskat in any assessment of compensation that 'may be necessary.
