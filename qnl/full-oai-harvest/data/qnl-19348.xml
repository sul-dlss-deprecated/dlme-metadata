Part of the upper level of the house was unfloored and in the dark Pelly had almost stepped into it but for the Minister grabbing him and pulling him to safety. Pelly reports that he had laughed the incident off at the time and that it had simply been caused by the fashion to leave buildings unfinished.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023882889.0x00000b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
