The principal correspondents in the file are the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Colonel Edward Ross, Shaikh Jāsim bin Muḥammad Āl Thānī, and the Residency Agent at Sharjah, Hajjī ‘Abd Āl Qāsim.The principal subjects discussed in the volume are:Relations between Shaikh Jāsim bin Muḥammad Āl Thānī of Qatar and Shaikh Zayid bin Khalīfah of Abu Zhabi [Abu Dhabi] including: Shaikh Jāsim’s intention to occupy the village of ’Odaid, considered to be Abu Dhabi property, with the Resident’s response to the move (folios, 5, 14), raids by Qatar tribes (folios 130-31) and subsequent reprisals (folios 134-35), reconciliation (folios 137-38), and a later deterioration of relations between Qatar and Abu Dhabi in 1885/86 (folios 189-91);Shaikh Jāsim bin Muḥammad’s intentions to attack the Ajman tribes at El Katiff [Al-Qaṭīf] (folios 34-35);The actions of Butuye bin Khadim and his people (the Kubeysat). The Kubeysat originated from ’Odaid and were indebted to Shaikh Jāsim bin Muḥammad. Butuye bin Khadim subsequently moved from Al Bidda to Wakrah [Wukrah] without repaying his debts, and was accused of stealing pearls at Wukrah (folios 59-61, 66-67);Reports of ill-treatment by the inhabitants of Al Bidda against Indian banians (folios 121-22);A report on a discussion between Commander Nesham of HMS
                              Woodlarkand Shaikh Jāsim bin Muḥammad Āl Thānī, dated 7 February 1882, covering: the 1868 treaty between Great Britain and Qatar, and Shaikh Jāsim’s desire to break relations with the Turks and have relations with Britain similar to that enjoyed by Abu Dhabi; Shaikh Jāsim’s relations with the Turkish authorities; and the treatment of Indian subjects [banians] in Qatar (folios 164-75);Reports of Turkish activities at Al-Hasa and Al-Qaṭīf (folios 176-80).Correspondence on these subjects throughout the volume, exchanged between Ross and the Government of India, includes discussion on the ambiguous jurisdictional nature of Britain’s relationship with Shaikh Jāsim bin Muḥammad Āl Thānī who, in spite of having signed a treaty with the British in 1868 (folios 52-53, 57-58), had aligned himself with Turkey in 1871. A copy of a letter from the Assistant Political Agent at Basrah [Basra] to the Political Resident and Consul General in Baghdad, dated 2 September 1886 (folios 214-15), indicates Abu Dhabi’s status as Britain’s most westerly protectorate on the Arab coast, and its close proximity to Qatar, the most southerly domain in Arabia under nominal Turkish control.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Qatar</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Abu Dhabi, Āl Nahyān dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HMS Woodlark, ship</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>'Ajmān (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Qubaysāt (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Al-Hasa</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Abu Dhabi</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>El Katiff</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign relations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000a0#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
