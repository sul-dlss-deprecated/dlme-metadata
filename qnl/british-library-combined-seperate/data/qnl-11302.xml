It covers the rebellion of Toorche Bilmer; the acquisition of Mocha by Mehemet Ali, Pasha of Egypt; the intentions of Mehemet Ali towards Aden, Muscat, and Baghdad; relations with the British Government and the Government of India; the proposed transfer of Aden to the British Government; communications between Colonel Patrick Campbell, British Consul General to Egypt with Boghos Bey, Egyptian Foreign Minister, and Mehemet Ali regarding troops in Yemen; and the actions of Captain Haines of the Indian navy in arranging the transfer of Aden with the Sultan of Aden.The memorandum discusses the right of sovereignty claimed by the Porte over Yemen, and the consequences this has for: the claim of duty under the Commercial Treaty of 1838; the question of reparations for 'insults and injuries' against British interests by Sheriff Mocha; and the right by which the British Government holds Aden.It is broken down into three sections:1. Turkish Claim of Sovereignty in Yemen;2. Sovereignty over Mocha;3. Sovereignty over Aden.Each section outlines the history of the area in terms of changes in sovereignty, and gives the British view on Turkish sovereignty.Includes three short letter quotes in French.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Mocha</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Egypt</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>WƒÅli of Egypt and Sudan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Yemen</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Military occupation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000222#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
