Kemball writes to inform Malet that he has received indemnity from payments of an 'oppressive character' levied by the Sheikhs of Bahrain against one particular Banyan [Indian] merchant. Enclosed with Kemball's letter is a translated extract of a letter (folio 42) from the British Agent at Bahrain, Hajee Jassim, to Kemball, dated 16 May 1853. Jassim writes that, since the Hindu merchant in question received a passport from the British authorities, he has been subjected to demands for rice from Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051555.0x00000e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
