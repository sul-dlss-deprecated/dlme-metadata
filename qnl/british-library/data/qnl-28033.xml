On consideration, we think that this Consulate- General is hardly competent to give an authoritative opinion on the Question raised by the Director, whom we have informed that, in the circumstances, we have referred the matter to the Embassy. 3. You may possioly wish to refer to the Government of India for a ruling. 4. A copy of a minute by the Vice-Consul on Marine Protests by Arab dhows is enclosed. This will assist in clarifying the position. Yours ever Consulate-General The Chancery, British Embassy Bagdad.I Copy ? 540 N o • D.N . /l 2/ / 54 Basra., i 1 i ^ ^ l?th Wpril, 1943. Sir, I have the hoAour^o_inform you that a certain amount of uncertainty would appear to exist regarding the status of native craft belonging to the Arab States bordering on the Persin Gulf, as on some occasions your Consulate- General accepts responsibility for handling ship’s papers, etc., and on other occasions they are referred to this Directorate for such services. I consider that it would be advisable to clarify the present ambiguous position regarding these craft, and would appreciate an expression of opinion from you regarding this matter. I have, etc., (Signed) C.J. GCLMAN. DIRECTOR G^NKRAL OP PORTS &amp; NAVIGATION H.B.M.’s Consul-General, BASRA.Copy MINUTE on 136? (19/1/10) .jdi- i MARINE PROTESTS •' ( 943 I All foreign vessels should make protests to the •'‘Port, all British to us. The question is under what heading do the dhows of the ’’British-protected” Arab ports come? 1* Aden is definitely British - a Colony now, so its boats should protest to us. 2. Muscat The Sultan is described on Rage 7 of the &amp; Oman ’’Persian G-ulf Pilot” 19U2 as an independent potentate who has commercial treaties with Britain Prance and America. This Sultanate is therefore foreign. 3. 4- Trucial Oman viz:Ras al Khaima) Urn al Qaiwain) Ajman j Sharja ) Dubai ) Abu Dhabi ) Al Qatar ) are described, idem, as ’’independently administered principalities, governed by independent Arab Shaikhs, who all have treaty engagements with Great Britain”. Muscat is foreign,&lt; therefore, these principalities are likewise foreign. Principality of Bahrain described, idem, as ”en independent Arab state under the protection of H.M.G: but it is not a British Protectorate”. ? Foreign (!) 5* Principality of Kuwait. described, idem, in same terms as Bahrain. In theory these nos.2-5 are independent, i.e. foreign, but in practice are part of the British Indian Empire - h/c? states with local autonomy. ~ ^ Dhows may also come from: 6* Saudi Arabia (including Ne.jd) 7* Iraq Persia (any?) 9* Portuguese India 10. British India of these (nos.6-10) only No.10 should lodge protests with us. For the S. Arabian coast line I fear I hove no up-to-date book (my edition of the Red Sea &amp; Gulf of Aden Pilot is that of 1932); but I believe all these ports are now r under British protection. The principal port is: Mukalla. I think that the S. Arabian ports* shins should only lodge protests with us if it is decided that the trucial Arab Ports* ships should do so.\ Cover for Enclosures in Weekly Letter No. P.Z dated from Secretary, Political and Secret Department (External), India Office, to Foreign Secretary, Foreign and Political Depart ment, Government of India.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x000369_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/830</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x000369</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/830</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Ext 3110/43 'Status of craft belonging to Arab States in Persian Gulf'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1943/1943</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-06-16T22:06:12</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (8 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 10; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file consists of correspondence and minutes between the Director General of Ports and Navigation, HM Consul-General at Basra, the Chancery, HM Ambassador at Baghdad and the Foreign Office, related to the status of ports in the Persian Gulf.
