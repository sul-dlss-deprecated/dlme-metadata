                           Sophie, under the command of Captain French; HMS Sophie is currently en route to Bombay with the captured vessel. It provides a statement outlining the history of events, as understood by the Resident, leading up to the seizure of a vessel from Bushire by said batille. It explains that this act was undertaken in response to money being taken from the owner of the boat by the Governor of Bushire, and that the owner claims he was given authorisation to recoup his losses in this manner by the Shaikh of Bahrain. It notes that the Shaikh denies this, though the letter outlines that it is the Resident's opinion that the batille owner may be telling the truth. This statement is being submitted so that the Bombay Government may pass judgement on the matter.It is noted that Captain French did not report the incident to the Resident as is required in the marine instructions, and the letter requests that the extent of the Resident's authority over the ships of the Royal Navy is clarified.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054362.0x000009#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
