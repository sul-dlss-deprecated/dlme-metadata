I am therefore setting out my ideas, in general terms, in tms letter, which I am addressing separately to all Consular Officers in Persia. There can, I think, be no doubt that you should as far as possible, maintain contact with men of all kinds at your headquarters. ^ re va ^ led .y ou f Circle, the more information will come your way and the harder it will be for people to attribute to you special sympathy with any particular faction or party, i 4 . °^^ lde y QUr headquarters, however, you should be careful not c stay with or pay visits to persons of importance if you are likely thereby to become identified with tribal or political intrigues and you should m any case cast your net sufficiently wide to forestall any charge of partiality. You vail be wise as far as possible to protect yourself against malicious rumour by frank consultation with the local Persian Governor or Governor-General. ™ an ^ othor visitors no doubt frequently ask your advice on political questions and ask to be told what H.M. Government wish them to do regarding the major political events of the day. When confronted by such enquiries you should do your best to encourage your questioners to think and decide for themselves.. Above all, you should be cautious abcut offering 'purely personal' advice, for it is generaliy construed as an official hint for the conseouences of which His Majesty's Government can be held responsible. Do not let your acquaintances think that being a 'friend of the British' entitles them to expect material rewards. Remember that our ’enemies’ are more important and often less harmful to us than our ’friends’ Try to strengthen the local authorities by making people look to’them rather han to you for help and advice and make your influence felt with the district 3 than with tho tribal ^ d political elements of your The problem of the attitude to be adopted towards the lUdoh . c ™ d ± } s aotiyities is being carefully considered both hero and m he Foreign Office and I hope soon to bo able to give you guidance on this point as well.

J» fv In the first place, I think it is necessary to say that the Indian angle on this whole business must be handled with considerable care. It has already been necessary for India to lend a publicity director to Tehran and I have not the least doubt that there will be calls on India to provide mechanical aid in the production of publicity material before long. Equally, Indian collaboration in a general publicity plan will be valuable —- but will not be forthcoming unless it is made very plain that India*s interests in Persia as a whole and Persian oil in particular are being carefully kept in view. It must not be fdl*gotten that A.P.O.C, employs something like 2,000 Indians — technicians and others — in Abadan and the oilfields and they need just as much care and attention as the British personnel in the Company. It should not be necessary for us in Delhi to have to remind alj. concerned that Indians must be included in any evacuation plan and that their morale and comfort needs just as much attention as that of the British personnel. Finally it must be recognised that the existence of a large community in Abadan is a standing invitation to the Communists to form a cell from which to step up penetration of India itself. I believe it is a fact that they have already had some success in winning over a certain nvanber, though not very many so far, of the Indian artisans at Abadan and we do not want to make things easier for them by leaving the Indian personnel with any sense of grievance against the Company or H.M.G. This, in brief, is reason why I have hitherto opposed the subordination of the Khorramshahr Consulate to /thethe Ahwaz Consulate-G-eneral, The latter is not manned by an officer of the Indian Services and the inevitable tendency is for him to overlook the Indian interest. A clear and precise directive to the Consulate-General in Ahwaz, however, would go far to remove Indian objection on this score, at any rate temporarily. I might add one other point. Prom backdoor sources I learn, though I cannot guarantee the accuracy of the information, that there is considerable resentment in Persian Government circles at .the fact that British E.P.T. is charged on profits of A.P.O.C. before the Persian Governments cut at profits comes in. The Persians feel too that far too large sums are set aside annually from revenue to reserves of different kinds and that the net result is that in spite of increased production the Persian 20$ share of the profits amounts to a far smaller sun than should be theirs in equity. The suggestion is that they intend to raise this question in the very near future and it may be that their resentment on this sc&lt;ore is one of the reasons which contributes to their lack of determination in dealing with Tudeh agitation*? 'C O 'J Judging by strict commercial ethics it may be that thePersians have no ground for complaint, but it may nevertheless be worth while considering whether some offer to re-examine the question of the share that they receive should not be made. I take it profits and dividends scarcely count in thi&amp;, score at present against the over-riding necessity for preserving A.P.O.C property and ensuring a full flow of petroleum products. 1/ 9 j /v (j &lt;w, dDear Aboil, (f JU.f ; 22nd July, 19 -j6* ^ 5 I am denlred, with the concurrence of the Foreign fi Ice, to forward for His Excellency's confidential information a copy of some recomendationn on policy in Persia which H. . Ambassador has sent on instructions from the Foreign Oflice. A co y is also enclosed of Foreign ofiice tclegr in No. 621 to the Ambassador. I an to make it clear that the recommendations are under consideration in the Foreign office and no decisions have been taken on them (except on tile question of propaganda). You will notice incidentally that naragraph 13 refers no the transfer of the Deficiency fion Bushxre. Tills, like the other recorr’cndatioas, is under consideration and if there is any reorientation of policy the Viceroy will of course be immediately informed. Yours sincerely, (Si; m. j, aa BSOtt G.E.B. Abell, FSq., Oil., OETt , IC .MKn/ (1c SECRET Q^HRiL A?^Rii;CIiiTIG?T Through ttu. agency of the Communist Tarty, Russian influence is being rapidly extended to every comer of Persia. This process is the reverse of spontaneous. It is a deliber tely planned nolitical offensive, inspired and directed from abroad, and is being driven hone by ruthless pressure upon all the weak note, economic, social and political^ of this backward country. local political leaders are compelled to adhere to a rigid party line laid down in Moscow, but have discretion in the application of that line to conditions on the rot. The process is one of infiltration and will continue until it is brought to a standstill by determined and well- organised opposition on the spot, or by instructions from Communist headquarters. The : urpo e of the offensive is to replace the existing social and economic older by a democrat 1c ,, regime, vowed to the introduction of Communism as soon as it become.': practicable. From evidence so far available here, it is not possible to deter ine whether the ultimate ai of thir offensive is strategic, economic or ideological, but it may well be a combination of the three. 2. For the e ecution of such a programme on a national cale, it is clearly indispensable that western, and in particular British, influence should be co pletely eli inated fr m Persia. The centre of British inflrience in ttu: country is the orovince of Khuzietan, where the property and installations of t e nglo-Irunian Oil Company are situatid. For many years the nglo-Iranian Oil Company has been the real authority throughout th t nrovince and it in the purpose of the Co munist i arty to destroy ^rtirh influence in Persia by severing it at its roots. On this baei , the activities of the Tudeh are perfectly intelligible. It does not aopear to be their present purpose to out the Company out of business but, on the basis of infor ation obtained from the Angl©-Iranian Oil ^o pany in ifersia, it seems re-: onablp certain that Thuzietan oil could be delivered to .the asoian in lar e quantities by pioeline or rail, or a co-ibination of both. . The possibility of a drive at some l&gt; ter date to tav© over the Co pany 1 ® prooertles cannot there fore be entirely excluded. 3. -aa-rnrhlle, by mi represent tion, chioanerie and open dellance, the Party are working to undermine the Company’s authority and to demonstrate even to the meanest intelligence the f^ct that it tu-s been und&lt; r- mined. In this they have so far succeeded that tne Co oany is at pr sent oper ting on sufferance and is losing authority over its own esy loyees. It is unnecessar to elaborate the effect vhich this state /ofot things Is bound to have upon the Company^ standing in the outside world and more particularly upon British prestige and influence in this country. Substantial progress has been made towards this initial objective, moreover, it is probably hoped to achieve more spectacular results as this war of nerves continues. Any false laove on the part of the Company at this stage will be exploited to create a deadlock between the Management and labour, which would interrupt production wholly or in part and might have the effect of stampeding liis Majesty’s Dover meat into some precipitate act of military intervention. If, as a result of an appeal to the United Nations Organisation, our forces were compelled to withdraw from South Persia, b i tis_ prestige in the Middle hast would be reduced to v nishing-point, Anglo-American relations would he prejudiced and whe way would be open for the extension of Soviet influence to the Persian Gulf. All this under the auspices of the United lations Organisation. In addition, a suspension of oil shipments from badan would retard the process of economic recovery throughout the world, and for this Great Britain would be held entirely responsible. 4. There are in f^ct two distinct reuuirmentsj the neutralisation of Communist activities throughout the country and the prevention of politic 1 sabotage in the oilfield area. it has been suggested the t for the first purpose an uttempt should dc made to u split” the Tudeh Party, but the ( Oimauniats organisation and methods are such that it would almost certainly be impossible to d} so. 'The Cedeh Party was originally composed of progressive heft vVing elements without any definite ideological affiliation, but it is now closely associated with the Communist Party. A direct attack upon it would be immediately detected, denounced and nip&gt;ed in the bud. In fact, it mi^ht ^rove a boomerang to those who had launched it. The attack on Tudeh integrity should therefore be indirect and aimed at detaching individual members as opportunity offers. Any such attempt should be i ccompanied by a carefulIp planned and directed propaganda drive de igned to rally opinion in favour of individualism and free institutions nnd against the reactionary principles and method* of communism. b # It is important th t such propaganda should be strongly positive end should deal only incidentally and even lightly with the deliberate and monotonous misrepresentstions of the Communist publicity machine. But publicity s^lone, even if extended to include every kind of modern technique, will not suffice to stem the Communist tide. So long as Tudeh propaganda is Inspired and directed from ioscow, the dice will be loaded against us and our counter-propaganda can at best have no more than a limited measure of success. very attempt must therefore be made to tecure political weapons and, if neceraary, to forge them. The Prime Minister** present attitude is not clear. His opponents maintain thj^t he is irrevocably committed to full co-operation with the Gommuniste but, since the conclusion of the Azerbaijan^- negotiations, he has shown signs of a desire - and it may be no more than a desire - to kick over the traces.It is of cardiml importance that no opportunity should fte missed of winning him over. He is a man of great experience and ability and his support, even if it were not open, or were subject to occasional back-sliding, would be far more valuable to ue than any other we can hope to secure at the present time. If, in the end, it turns out that lie is in no sense a free agent, we shall be obliged to look elsewhere. But, under existing conditions, our traditional friends in this country will almost certainly x^rove to be broken reeds, and the success of our efforts would therefore depend upon whom we succeeded in detaching from the more progressive elements who, at present, are either neutral or ringed against us. 6. In view of the 1 rime Ministers undertaking to introduce legislation for implementing the Persian-Soviet oil agreement by the end of October, there will, however, be strong Soviet objection to a postponement of the elections, and if the elections take place in August or September as originally contemplated, we must pin our faith to the Prime Minister. Our main purpose it-ould be to ensure that the Government do not put their full weight behind the Tudeh Party machine and that they allow reasonable scope to our propaganda. 7* In the event of a decline in Tudeh influence, whether it is accompanied by a postponement of the elections or not, we shall probably find that the soviet Government will became more tractable. They aay even be disposed to discuss the possibility of an ideological truce, not only in Persia, but throughout the world, for it will have been demonstrated to them that their system of political penetration is not irresistible* Then, and only then, we might seriously consider negotiating a multi-lateral agreement, with the full approval of the United States Government. Aich a general settlement would, naturally, include Persia as one of the principal fields of ideological dispute, but it would have none of the obvious disadvantages of a tripartite or bilateral settlement on the 1907 model, such as was recentlyr suggested by M. Qavam. 8» The action needed to ensure the uninterrupted working of the Khuaistan oilfields and the Abadan refineries is in one sense similar to that required in the wider field, but it has certain particular aspects, some of a military and some of a political nature, which reguire separate study. Whatev r the present indentions~of the Tudeh Party may be with regard to the Anglo-Iranian Gil Company, there is little doubt that if they are returned to power at the polls, they will have no difficulty in making it impossible for the Company as at present constituted to operate on a sound commercial basis. There can be no doubt that the present situation in South Persia is extremely precarious* The authority of the Anglc-lranian Gil Company and of the Persian provincial authorities has been openly defied and there is, as yet, no regular machinery of negotiation between the Management of the Campon and labour. Although far/X £ far ahead of iereian standai^de, labour conditions have, in some in. tances, been sacrificed to the need for f? erea * in S ^tput. particularly at tli / gha jari field. ^very effort ia being made to remedy the e defects but some time must elapse before the Caapany if able to challenge all criticism. There have hitherto been no serious disorders but there ia nothing to prevent a sudden deterioration and should Uiis occur, the rersian provincial authorities may be unable or unwilling to provide adequ-itoprotection. If it becomes necessary to intervene with force, the military elements provided must obviously be adequate for their task, ii bloodshed on a 1 rge scale is to be precluded.CJ^UKR jX HSOOil 1. j Mbllclty; («) na should develop out etuapalgn with gathering fiUMtntm* (b) The line adopted ehouid be clear, direct end ® should rt ell coete evold becaaing involved in futile controversy* (c) We ehouid lend cohesion and support to all genuinely democratic Persian elements* (d) lo party or Individual should be ettacked rs such but no one who Is working directly or in direct 2/ for the establlshsMnt of a totalitarian or foreign-inspired regime, of whatever colour, should be spared* (e) )i externa publicity should be given to the eo&amp;enttally humane end progressive nature of British policy and institutions end to our readiness to assist others if *e are asked to do so* (f) -e should not remind the Persians of p? st benefits or hark back to previous phases of their country's development unless directly challenged and in that event it vlll often be more ef active to ridicule such charges* (g) m should never forget the importance of the United Nations Organisation* (h; Ppr the execution of this programme additional staff end equipment will be needs rind the first kjLjh^ duty of the nee director of publicity will be / , ^ &gt; VWw . to formulate specific proposals* / 2* wo opportunity should be lost of building up opposition to Com unlsm, by detaching members from the pup:&gt;et pa rties, by fostering the natural antipathy of religious bodies end, if possible, by encouraging the formation of a nee progressive party on democratic lines* 3« We should continue our efforts to sean the Irime minister a«ay from his estociation with the TUdeh Party and from one or too Uinliters in his Immediate entourage who are entirely under Communist influence* 4* It should be borne in mind that none of these reett* entk tlon© sill be finally effective unless, by determined end effective opposition to the Com on 1st steamroller, m can bring it home to the Huaslane /thatthat politic?;! aggression does not pay nod that their ’Jfcf&amp;t course will be to negotiate e general ©ettleaient ' t th the .astern de;aocr? eles providing inter f ile for af) ideological truce on ail their frontier©# &amp;&gt;-KOI/:X mGQi ^D'TlVXz ( l 1 # Ho tiroe should be loot In setting up regular machinery for consultation betwsen ths ransgeiasnt of ths /nglo-Ireninn Oil Coraprny end their steff and labour* This should Includes (a) drafting by the Central Oovermaent of the trade union legislation prescribed In the new labour lew* (b) building up by the /.ngio-Iranlan oil Company of s strong Industrial Hslotions Dspj rtmsnt to be responsible for dealing with wage claims and awards and the organisation of all sub- cot ifait tees dealing with labour Questions* (c) setting up of f ctory councils.

If the situation is allowed to drift, it will almost certainly deteriorate. The Persian Prime Minister is already hinting at the possibility of including a Tudeh representative in his Government. The result of the forthcoming elections may in any case bring the Tudeh Party into power in Tehran. If therefore there are any precautionary measures which we could usefully take in South Persia to protect British interests before the Tudeh. Party have consolidated their position in Tehran, we have obviously no time to lose. 2. For your own most secret information, I should explain that any cutting off of Abadan*s supplies of oil would at the present time have disastrous economic consequences in the United Kingdom and throughout the Empire. It is therefore a matter of vital importance to do whatever is possible to prevent the Tudeh Party, at Russian instigation, from taking any action which would result in cutting off these oil supplies. 3. It is obviously necessary in these circumstances for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to defend themselves against Tuueh' criticism by generous treatment of their Persian workmen and by encouraging the growth of a genuine trade union movement among them. But such measures, desirable as they &amp;re in themselves, will obviously not be sufficient to guard us against wanton Tudeh interference with the Company*s operations under their concession. After all, the stimulus behind the recent' agitation against the Company is not so much a genuine concern for the welfare of Persian workmen as a political campaign' against British interests as such. 4. The essential point seems to me to secure the removal of political agitators from any key positions which they at present occupy, in South west Persia. Any irresponsible Tudeh leaders in important positions in which they might be able to injure the Ail.O.C.*s operations should be replaced by reputable men in whom the Company have confidence. Action to achieve these ends will have to be planned in the knowledge that it may have to be taken without the*co-operation, ana perhaps against the wishes, of the Tehran Government, and I # should like you to consider how the local Governor and/or police authorities can be stimulated to show sufficient local indepenaence to prevent our plans being interfered with by orders from Tehran. It may well*s f well 'be necessary in fact for us to draw upon the friendly feelings entertained towards us 'by certain local elements, ^ e.g. the tribesmen, and to follow the Russian example of encouraging and exploiting provincial discontent. 5 . I attach so much importance to drawing up urgent plans for putting some such new policy into effect that I hope to arrange for Mr. Berthoua of the Ministry of Fuel and Power to fly out to Tehran at once to discuss the whole position with yourself and the management of the A.I.O.G. I hope that he will 'bring hack for my consideration your definite recommen dations for implementing a new policy on foregoing lines. 6 . It is clear, Moreover, that the implementation of such a policy will require very special qualifications on the part of the local Manager of the A.I.O.G, I have no doubt that the present incunhent is competent as regards his &gt; ordinary commercial functions, hut do you think he is the right man to carry through a political plan of action such as I hope you will recommend? O.T.fdFORElcm CiiTIGE, S. W.1 inh July, 1 946* In view of the serious situation in South Persia the Foreign Secretary recently instructed our Ambassador at Teliran to send him comprehensive recommendations as to the policy which we should nursue and arranged for hr.

Th' Antoassador’s report has now been received and I enclose a copy for the information of Sir Stafford Grippe together with a copy of a Foreign office minute commenting on the despatch. Ur. Berin hopes to have an op ortunity of discussing with Sir Stafford Grippe, 1ST. Shinwell, Ur. ' ilmot and Ur.

MKA/ SECRET SECRET GENERAL RKCOU^KDATICKS 1. Publicity: (a) We should develop our campaign with gathering momentum. (b) The line adopted should be clear, direct and positive . We should at all costs avoid becoming involved in futile controversy. (c) We should lend cohesion and support to all genuinely democratic Persian elements. (d) No party or individual should be attacked as such but no one who is working directly or indirectly for the establishment of a totalitarian or foreign-inspired regime, of whatever colour, should be spared. (e) Maximum publicity should be given to the essentially humane and progressive nature of British policy and institutions and to our readiness to assist others if we are ased to do so. (f) We should not remind the ersians of past benefits or hark back to previous phases of their country’s development unless directly challenged and in that event it will often be more effective to ridicule such charges. (g) We should never forget the importance of the United Nations Organisation. (h) For the execution of this programme additional staff and equipment will be needed and the first duty of the new director of publicity will be to formulate specific proposals. 2. No opportunity should be lost of building up opposition to Communism, by detaching members from the puppet parties, by fostering the natural antipathy of religious bodies and, if possible by encouraging the formation of a new progressive party on democratic lines. 3 . We should continue our efforts to wean the Prime Minister away from his association with the Tudeh Party and from one or two Ministers in his immediate entourage who are entirely under Communist influence. L. It should be borne in mind that none of these recommendations will be finally effective unless, by determined and effective opposition to the Communist steam-roller, we can bring it home to the Russians /that(S) © tha^ political, aggression docs not pay atx i that their best course will be to negotiate a general settlesaent with the Western democracies providing inter alia lor an ideological t race on all their frontiers. Rr,CiMl,ulx&gt; SICIIj i .lU'.i: 1» No tiiuG should he lor&gt;t in settln^r up rStjular machinery for consultation between the Management of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and their atafT and labour* This should include: (a) drafting by the Central Government of the trade union legislation prescribed in the new labour law. (b, building up by the nglo—Iranian Oil Company of a strong Industrial Relations Department to be responsible for dealing with wage claims and awards and the organisation of ai 1 sub— ccxamitteeB dealing; with labour Questions. (c) setting up of factory councils. (d) encouragement of Senior and Junior Persian staff to form their own trade unions. At least one member of the Abadan management should, by temperament, ex. erience and knowledge of the language, be fitted to deal sympathetically with Persian problems, both local and provincial. ~ * 2. Every effort should be made to improve living standards for all categories of workers, particularly for labour, and the highest priority should be given to materials and equipment required for this purpose. The Company would do well to adopt as its criterion in these matters Western, rather than i&amp;iatem, standards, for only in this way will they be able, in the long run, to turn the tables on their critics. 3* The Public Relations Department should be encouraged to develop its activities. Cinema projectors, a wireless re-transmitter and new films should be supplied. It is also suggested th;jt the Company should bring out a newspaper of their own at Abadan for distribution through out the area. In general, everything possible should be done by the Management to take their staff, British and Persian,into their confidence. 4* Everything should also be done to maintain the morale of the British staff, particularly in the oilfields, and to eliminate any legitimate grievance but, at the present time, the visit of a Government Direc or is not needed and might even prove to be embarrassing. 5* From ray point of view, and subject to the last paragraph of 1 above, no change in tho Management at Abadan or the representation at Tehran seems necessary but, during the present period of tension, it is mo t undesirable that the General Manager should be absent from his post for an extended period. 6 */6 . A policy of reducing Royalties a« a means of pressure on the Persian Government is not'nlikely to produce useful results. It would be exploited by the Communist© and would afford them a pretext for Invoking the arbitration clause of the concession ajRTeement or for taking no less arbitrary retaliatory action. Only if the Persian Government themselves prove pewerless in the face of serious disorder should payment of Royalties cease and in that event they should be entirely suspended until the situation has been restored. In meh an event, however, it is to be assumed that we should be compelled to Intervene with force. 7. The Company is already exposed to criticism on account of the number of foreigners they employ and any substantial increase in their number would almost certainly produce a violent reaction, nor can it be assumed that, in future, the British staff would be allowed to operate the plants in the event of a general strike at any of them. 8 * The increased sales of sterling, consequent on the Company^ accelerated development programme, may shortly entail an increase in the note circulation, to which there are definite statutory limits. It is there fore essential for the prosecution of their construction programme that every effort should be made by His Majesty f s Government to increase the provision of British goods and services (including air services) for the Persian market. 9« Consideration should be given to the development of alternative sources of oil supply e.g. in Kuwait, and to the practicability of refining outside Persia any increased production now contemplated. On political ground© there would, I suggest, be great advantage In this. 10. The responsibility for re moving agitators must remain with the Persian Government. If we were to urge action in specific cases, we might induce further deterioration, for we have no means of preventing the arrival of the same or other agitators in the area at a later date. There is at present no prospect whatever of Inducing the Governor-General to take action in this or fcny other matter In defiance of the Central Government. 11. Unless and until there is a serious deterioration* due either to the outbreak of disorder or to the advent to power of a frankly Communist Government, morp harm than good will be done by encouraging the intervention of friendly tribes or by associating ourselves openly, or secretly, with separatist movement© such as that sponsored by the local Arab Union. These are factors which might be turned to some advantage at a later stage, but we shall lose nothing by holding aloof from them for the present. 12. The Company’s entire property in Persia should, if possible, be included in the district of one superintending Consul and, for this purpose. His Majesty’s Consul at Khorramshahr should come under the super intend enoe of His Majesty 9 s Consul-General at Ahwaz.13. While tne situation in South Persia remains tense, the transfer of the Residency from Bushire to Bahrain should be deferred# The criticisms to which we may be exposed if we retain the Residency at Bushire for the next few months will do us far less harm than the impression which would otherwise be created that we are withdrawing it in the face of difficulties. 11+. In the event of serious disorder which the Persian Government is unable or unwilling to control, it may be impossible to avoid military intervention. Our military plans for dealing with such a contingency are naturally outside my competence, but, while I assume that such action would obly be taken in the very last resort, it is clearly essential that the requisite military forces should be immediately available if they are required.PSK3IA, Tehran despatch Ho. 228 of 1st July. The picture which Mr. Le Rougetel draws in this despatch is that under Soviet Communist direction an attempt is 'being made to eliminate British influence from Persia altogether and that the Tudeh Party, which, although originally composed of progressive left-wing elements without any ideological affiliation, is now closely connected with the Communist Party, la 'being used as the instrument of this purpose. Since the principal source of British influence in Persia is the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, the Company is the natural object of attack and the Party have been working by every means to undermine its position. On the political side, Mr. Le Rougetel’s proposals for immediate action are:- Propaganda on the lines laid down in his general recommendation No. 1. To continue our efforts to wean the Prime Minister away from his association with the Tudeh Party and from one or two Ministers in his immediate entourage who are entirely under Oonmunist influence. Kr. Le Rougetel emphasises the Importance of losing no opportunity to win him over. Our main purpose should be to ensure that the Persian Government do not put their full weight behind the Tudeh Party machine and that they allow reasonable scopie to our propaganda. Progressive elements should be encouraged to look to us rather than to the Tudeh 1 arty and if possible we should encourage the formation of a new progressive part on democratic lines. This recommendation leads on naturally to Mr. Le Rougetel* s principal industrial recommendation, items ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) of his special recommendations. So far as propaganda la concerned, you have already authorised action and we have confirmed to Mr. Le Rougetel that he can go ahead. A vigorous propaganda campaing was incidentally one of the chief recommendations of the Parliamentary delegation which has just been to Persia. On the general political side, Mr. Le Rougetel’s recommendation that we should attempt to win over the Prime Minister and prevent him so far as possible becoming a complete Russian tool is the policy which we have been pursuing. The Persian Prime Minister has just taken action which makes it easier for us to support him, since he has formed a 'Persian Democratic Party' with a programme which covers most of the main points of the 1944 Tudeh programme and goes into much greater detail. Persians of all parties are of course much better at producing programmes than at carrying them out, but it is encoura :ing that the Persian Prime Minister should have taken this step. Much will depend on the sort of people he gets into his party and we shall have to watch this carefully. Meanwhile, I am not sure how far, in view of this new development, Mr. Le Rougetel still wishes that we ourselves should encourage the formation of yet another progressive party. It runs counter to your own feeling that the Tudeh Party may yet be the Party of the future. I think it would be /worthworth asking him for further Informatl n on this aspect of his recommendations. At the same time, we should enquire more •bout his proposal to foster the natural antipnthy to Communism of religious bodies. This may he a desirable move but we ought to have more detailed information as to what is proposed. Subject to clarification of these points we could certainly approve $r. Le Rougetel’s general recommendations Nos. (2) and (3) • Turnin : to the action proposed on the industrial side, these are all matters in which the A.I.O.C. are already making progress, but ne-id further encouragement. The general spirit of these proposals is in line with the recormnerelations of the Parliamentary delegation. As to the best way of bringing home to the A.I.O.C. the importance of the points made by Mr. Le Rougetel, it has been suggested that the best course mi^it be for you and Mr. Shinwell together to meet Sir W, Fraser and discuss the problem with him. In order to obtain the best results ' I think the line to take might be that the Company had done a very good job in building up this great enterprise and had given a lead to Persia in many aspects of labour welfare and treatment. But a new phase is now opening in the relationship of British oil companies operating abroad and their local labour and they can only hope to hold their positions if they order their affairs according to the best Western standards. You could suggest :hat the A.I.O.C. are no doubt already working on these lines, and you would be glad to know how they view Mr. L* Rougetel*s proposals. It has also been suggested by Mr. Berthoud that, since the problem of the relationship of local labour to British oil companies operating in foreign territory is common to a number of companies, it might be very useful if on some separate occasion, you and Mr. Shinwell could convene the chairmen of all the principal companies and discuss the problem with them. The development programme which it is hoped the A.I.O.C. will carry out will involve the provision of large quantities of material and their labour relationship programme will need skilled men. We have already promised our help in obtaining priorities. But it would be helpful if you would write personally to the Minister of Supply, the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Labour, asking them to give general directions to their Departments to deal rapidly and favourably with all requests from the A.I.O.C. for facilities required for their development programme. I understand that Mr. Le Rougetel attaches particular importance to Item 8 of the special recommendations and it might be useful if you could write personally to the President of the Board of Trade about this also. Fina].ly there Is the question of the possible general settlement with the Russians which Mr. Le Rougetel raises in the seventh paragraph of his appreciation and the fourth paragraph of his general recommendations. Mr. Le Rougetel appears to be opposed to making any approach, whether in the /generalgeneral ideological field or in the more limited sphere of otl relatione in Persia, until we have made some progress in checking the Russian advance* This conflicts with the suggestion put up hy the Department that it might be possible to reach some sort of an understanding wherebv His Majesty^ Government would undertake not to apply for or support applications by British nationals for new oil concessions or oil rights in North Persia, and the Soviet Government to furnish a corresponding undertaking regarding South Persia, a proposal which I see from your minute of the 5th July you are inclined to favour. Further discussion is clearly needed on this point, but since I understand from Mr* Berthoud that Mr. Le Rougetel feels that to make such an approach now would give an impression of weakness and so merely encourage the Russians in their efforts to remove our influence entirely from Persia, it might be better not to pursue it for the moment • On the question of the desirability of having a Resident Director of the Company in the oilfields, Mr* Berthoud was of the opinion that no very great advantage was to be derived from this innovation. Even a Resident Director would be obliged to refer home all questions of policy and it is only such questions which the management in the fields are not competent to decide. This is a matter, however, in which discussions the company would obviously be desirable. Mr. Berthoud was also of the opinion that a visit to the oilfields by Lord Alanbrooke was for the same reason not to be recommended at the present moment. In addition the visit of so high-powered a representative as the late Chief of the General Staff might well give rise to suspicions which would be exploited by the Communist element in Persia that his visit had some ulterior military significance* (Sgd.)
