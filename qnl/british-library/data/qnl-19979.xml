In the first place the men whom Vallance was going to get to run the Final Stage School and the Teachers T Training School, who are Lebanese, are very reluctant to come here. They were pre viously employed by the Iraq Education Department and we believe that in common with all Syrian teachers in Iraq they are now being dismissed. If so they may still come on here. Vallance is being sent up to Baghdad again to try and get in touch with them and give them a week or ten days in which to make up their minds, and if they decline he will then go to Palestine and if necessary to Egypt to try and find teachers of the class required. It is a pity that Bahrain has to look so far afield but it is of course inevitable at pre sent and the three months t vacation which has now begun is by no means too long a period in which to search for and engage these teachers. 3• In regard to the Technical School, the difficulties are even greater. It is barely worth while undertaking a fundamental re-organisation of the Technical School, expanding it and equipping it and employing additional instructors unless we can get hold of an absolutely first class Principal. Efforts v..ere made to try to get a certain man from England who / - Hon^ole Lieut-Colonel C. G. Prior, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.who Wc=s stro n S-'-^ recommended by Hutchings, but unfortunately he apparently cannot leave England. There are of course English technical instructors employed in Iraq but none of them have got the very wide qualifications required in the Principal of the College here and in any case it is scarcely the time to try to filch from Iraq Englishmen who have been employed there through the efforts of the Embassy or the British Council. 4» I am afraid I do not know what standard has been reached in Inaia in technical education. Here again I do not imagine fi we could get^first class Englishman with wide experience and qualifications, and I am not sure if there are any Anglo-Indians who could hold the job. We can of course make enquiries, but I have been wondering whether it would not be a good plan in the present circumstances to try out an American. I should never think of this in normal times but as things are at present it does seem to be worth while taking this into consideration. Before however I suggest it formally to the Bahrain Government I should be most grateful if you would let me know what you think of this idea. One of the objections is that Americans are usually more expensive than Englishmen, but on the other hand we sh^t/' have expert aid from the Oil Company in selecting a really good man at as reasonable a wage as possible. 5. Meanwhile I have given Thornburg a copy of Hutching^s Report, Vallance has had further talks with Hutchings, and he, Belgrave and I are going to see what we can get out of the Oil Company now.

Dear Lord Lloyd, I was very pleased and encouraged 'by your letter of the 23rd May and your prompt decision to send Dundas to discuss what the British Council can do in the Persian Gulf and Oman. I look forward to his arrival in Bagdad about the 20th June, 2. A certain number of students are already coming from Koweit and Bahrain and even Muscat, including a near relative of the Sultan o^ Muscat, to be educated in Iraq where they are only too liable to fall under undesirable influences. If they could be intercepted by a college otf other educational institution, say at Bahrain, their and British interests would be served. Students from Saudi Arabia, ^hich is now being enriched by an American oil company, might also attend such an institution- 5. You will of course know well what a great and beneficial influence has been exercised in the 'Par Kast by the Hong Kong University. I do not mean to suggest that there is an opening for even the embryo of anything similar in Bahrain, particularly in view of the Victoria College at Alexandria and the prospect of an offsrping at Bagdad, but I just mention it in illustration of the utility of such foundations. It may indeed be premature to take any action in Bahrain now but I am sure that it will already be useful to study the situation anri prepare for action.

Dear Dundas, I understand from you that the British Council are consider ing the expansion of their work in Bahrain. As you know, we are greatly concerned with the strategic advantages of a quiet pied -a- terre here, and anything that disturbed the political atmosphere would be contrary to our interests. V*e tnereiore hav^ to consider any proposals from the political as well as the educational point of view. 2. As I understand it, the policy of the council is to encourage the inhabitants of the Middle Last to look to Britain tor their cultural contacts, and that their immediate object in Bahrain is to keep students at home where subversive propaganda is lees likely to reach them, fcith both of these aims we are in full agreement, but there is an underlying danger which we should do well to avoid. 3. It appears to be a universal law in the Last that the un employed student is the normal focus for political agitation, and there have already been signs of this in Bahrain and Kuwait. %e should therefore consider closely the probable sourceb ol employment open to these students and make our plans accordingly. I am doubtful if the present openings are likely to increase substantially, and we should underestimate rather than over estimate our figures. If a survey shows that a majority of the vacancies are of a technical nature we should cater for this in the education provided.

It would be ©ssible to reach and raalntain a higher standard in the junior section han would be possible in the three existing junior schools, and by running ha three sections as one anifc considerable economies could be effected In taffing and other runnin- costs. The whole could be housed in fine all dings with adequate grounds and playing fields which would not only • a drew for boys from outsile, but a cause of satisfaction and pride o Behrelnls. • It Is very difficult to forecast the response with which the ulf College should meet darin the first few years but I believe that it tumid be started as a going concern with the boys in the present technical chool and Kullya as a nucleus for the technical and senior section, and oys between the ages of 9+ and 12+ accepted for the junior section. The cuabers would be low for the first few years ond therefore expenditure ould be on a smaller scale than in the estimates given below. In dditlonj the cost of buildings for boarding acco nmodi tion and to a lesser xtent classroom and steff accommodation could be spread over a period f 3 to 4 years. . The basis on which the following estimates are jjut forward is: 1) Humber of boys who could be re; dily absorbed In the Gulf area from technical section ^ P er y«ar 2) Nun&amp;er of boys who could be rea dily absolved in the (valf area from senior section 5® P e)? ya ^r The ...th« whol* bo y 3 &amp;n ^ inolusive, rin. 000 per annum, leaving *17,000 per axinura at eternal Bources. 15 lti&amp; suggestion is that the ( overruaent o: of'tbe cost of 'building and eqtulpraent and 50% o «« 500 per annum on the figures I have given# tare sponsible for the remaining 16» These figures of expenditure on staff necessary if the school contained the 4 junior ; '-ehnical years, almost irrespective of the num and the deficit arrived at represents the mrxiirrt few years expenditure would be less, and if the after the first few years the receipts should ii that the school could ever 'become self-supportii fee reduced to between i 5,000 and 10,00 ) per am 17. staffing It would at first be necessary to emplc Egypt, Palestine and the Sudan* But it should to -orovide scholarships for its pupils to procee eoliegee in these countries or in England.

In spite of this Hutchings prefers to come to Bahrain. 3. Hutchings must have lost his job owing to recent events in Iraq and it is possible that, if he has not fallen into the hands of the rebels, he may take the post offered to him in Egypt by Oundas unless he is aware that he is wanted in Bahrain.

I am not, however f in a.jreement with his theory that a general education should cease at 14 for everyone except those who can pass a competitive examination into the iinai School or 'i.U-i.iya H . I believe it is essential for sons of sheikhs and important people to be able to continue their education. It is platitudinous to say that an unemployed effendi class must not be created; but the children of -notables'' are not likely to be un employed, and until Bahrein becomes much more socialist in structure, the sons of notables (irrespective of their ability to pass examinationsy will hold most of the positions of importance. /he suggestions put forward in another section of this report {Gull* College) show how I consider the problem might be met.yl D.C#No•C/572-4/16»B Dated the 9th June 1941. f i Z1 I -v 3/C . vc / - I *i v ^ - Sl b /' Reference your Printed letter No, 271~S of 't *»»».-r:' 1 '- 1st May 1941, -- T .M 2. I discussed Dundas's letter with Belgrave and our feeling is that the scheme is too big and the financial coirjnitments too heavy to be embarked on without expert advice such as you have suggested in your demi-official ^ (i-ti letter No. 270-S dated 1st May 1941^to Weightman. Bel- grave also feels that Dundas has largely over-estimated the number of students from outside Bahrain who are likely to attend and it is hardly likely that there will be any parents willing to pay such high fees as are suggested. 3. The scheme appears to contemplate the closing down of the existing Junior Schools at Muharraq and Hedd and making the boys go to the Junior Section of Manama. This may not be a very popular move. There are other y ■T questionable points in his letter and in the draft agree ment, which would have to be clarified before the scheme The Hon'ble Lieutenant Colonel could /- C. G.

I forward herewith the copy of demi-official letter No. 1028/2E dated the 11th June 1941 from Belgrave which amplifies the views given in my demi-official letter under reference. 3. Paragraph 2 I agree that the Bahrain Government might confine itself to improving and expanding local education in Bahrain on the lines on which they are now working. Paragraph 3 One of the Palestinian teachers was undesirable and has been dispensed with. Paragraph 8 It would be advisable to have some estimate of the number of boys from outside Bahrain who would be likely to attend the College. I could make enquiries from the Trucial Coast and Qatar as far as this Agency is concerned. But Dundas 1 idea was that the attendance would be low at first and grow as the College got better known. Paragraph 12 There is a very serious discrepancy in the fees suggested by Dundas and those being paid here by boys attending the Kulliyah which approximate those mentioned by you as being paid by day boys of the Stuart Memorial College, Isfahan. I Paragraph 14 /- he Hobble Lieut-Colonel C. G. Prior, C. I.

Representation should at least be 50 - 60. Paragraph 15 Dundas 1 Scheme was undoubtedly based on other such projects in Egypt, Iraq, etc., with.which he was concerned, and the idea of collecting all the schools^in Manama at least^ into one block of buildings in suitable grounds is of course a good one. I feel however that the scheme as it stands is too ambitious and is obviously not founded on a study of local conditions. 4. The whole question might be gone into by the Educational Commissioner if and when he pays a visit to Bahrain. Yours sincerely.. Ho. 1028/ZR. Bahrain, June ii, 1941 Dear ^Ib&amp;n, Referring to our tulk on 7th June about Dundas 1 sch6i&amp;@ lor establishing a Gulf College in Sahi'ain. I think it is advisable to put on record some of my views on his proposal* £• 1 have discussed the scheae with ohaikh iibdullah. we are both of the opinion that this is not the time for the Bahrain Government to incur heavy financial liability and to launch a schema whose success depenas so much upon the support from neighbouring Gulf States, ie think that *hile the war continues in this part of the world the Bahrain Government should coniine its activities to improving and expanding local education in Bahrain on tne lines on which hav^ been working during the past year. Shaikh ^bdullah is naturally more interested in the education of Bahrain .^abs than in providing educa tional facilities for foreigners from other parts of the Gulf. y^&gt; 3. There are various statements in the report which call for comment, some of them are criticisms of the educational ^ork in Bahrain which appear to have been made without Knowledge or foundation. It is stated in paragraph 1 of the report that many undesirable teachers are employed in the schools of Bahrain ana Kuwait. The majority of our teachers are local wjrabs, carefully chosen, who in some cases have served satisfactorily for ten or fifteen years.The Syrian tauchers were persoiiclly selected by President Louge oi t£i6 ;yfi i fe3X , icsi.ii Oiiiversxt»y or lie y rout iind with tue except ion of tiie lute oyricin Superintanaeat oi schools they iiave proved sucessful. The Palestiniciixd ^ere recoMended oy the British education authorities of that country. Should an undesirable teacher get into the education system of Bahrain he would very soon be removed• I fail to see on what grounds this sweeping statement was made by Dundas who visited the schools once, with ma, during his stay in Bahrain, and appeared neither to understand or to take interest in tne masters or in the work which was in progress. 4. The Bahrain Government has always contem plated the eventual substitution of foreign teachers by local teachers trained in the govermaent schools. This was one of the main reasons for the estciblisn- mant of the Kulliyah last October. almost all the local teachers, male and female, were trained in the government schools but for some years to come it will be necessary to employ a certain percentage of oyrians, Palestinians or Egyptians, as is being done at present and as is recommended in Dundas* report. The principle of increasing the British teaching staff in the Kulliyah and in the Technical uchool, when possible, was accepted by the Bahrain Government. ikt present the Director of Education teaches himself in the Kulliyah. 5. 1 asked Vallance about his conversation with Dundas and I understand that nothing resembling-3- r 'Jf I ' a discussion tooK: placa but that Dundas set forth some of his proposals without asking for any infor- laation on what ^as now b^ing done in educational matters in Bahrain. 6. On page E, section there is a reference to the system of competitive examinations for admis sion to the Kulliyah which, accoraing to Dundas, might result in sons of Shaikhs and notables getting no education after the age of 13. This suggestion shows an ignorance of the educational position in Bahrain. a boy who was incupuble of passing the Kulliyah entrance exaaiaation could not arrive at the top class of one of the other schools at the age of 13. Dull boys are forced by the examination system to spend a second year in each class which means that a dull boy starting school life at six or seven would not be ready to leave school till 16, 17 or even 18 at which age young shaikhs normally marry. oons of shaikhs and notables are already well represented in the Kulliyah. There are, in addition to government schools, two flourishing private schools, one in Manamah and one in Muharra%, attended by about BOO and iOu boys respectively. They are patronised by sons of saai^hs and notables as well fc.s lesser fry# Shaikh abctullah has suggested giving these schools sosac financial nelp in the same way as has been suggested in the case of Muta &amp;a schools. The boys ^ho are unable to pass the examination into the present K.ulliyt ;h are really stupid and would act as a drag on the more intelligent'.-4- A competitive exaaiaation appears the most fair and reasonable iuethod of picking bo /s for advanced education. Last year it is true that a nusber of boys wiio failed in the examination had to leave school because they had cosipleicd their ccuru^ and were too old to be kept on. Jome of the parents resented this and special classes were opened for those boys tfho wished to continue their education. Only a fe* boys availed the &amp;selves of the claasos* The weeding out of such a number of older boys ma not a normal procedure but was necessary on this occasion o^ing to the reorganisation of the system, 7. In section 3 of the report it stated that it would be possible to maintain a higher standard in the junior section of the proposed college than in the three existing junior schools. There see ^as to be no justification for this statement. It would certianl^ be cheaper to coabine the three proposed new schools in one building but at the same tia^ the existing schools at ikdd and kuaarraq, and probably Manamah, «ould still be required. The govarnffient «/ould have to provide schools for boys who were ineligible or unable to pay for the tuition in the proposed college. 8. In section 4 Dundas mentions the difficulty of forecasting the response to the soheae. I think before embarking on so costly a scheiae an attempt should be made to ascertain what response ^as likely from other Gulf States. I know that replies to enquiries would not be reliable but at least it might be possible to discover how many parents in iiua/aitajKi Osuiii with sons ol suitHbls Ege would be in a. position to pay fees, 8. oection 5 of the report shows that Dundus has.no conception of sooittl conditions in Bahrain. Sh&amp;ikhs do not become government officials or school teachers, except a very few who hold such posts as magistrutas, oonii of merchants usually enter their father 1 s business. Sons of working class or artisan parents do not attend the town schools, only the village schools are attended by labourers and cultivators. The majority of the boys at the to ^n schools are the sons of shopkeepers brokers and clerks, in fact the middle classes. in'the bbm &amp; section it is stated that about 50^ of the places in the college would be reserved for ikihrainis, the full number is to be 500 there fore eventually the college will contain about 250 boys from other purts of the Gulf. I think conditions in the Gulf will have to change very radically before this number of boys paying the fees which are suggested in the report is forthcoming. 10» In section 7 it ic suggested that most of the boys in the junior school would be day boys, including boys from Hedd and Muharraq. .vt present we find it so difficult for boys from Head ^.nd Muhar- raq to attend the Kulliyah as day boys that those who come from there are boarders. 11. The rates of pay of English and Asiatic masters mentioned in section 13 appears to be extra vagant. I understand that English masters in Ira^ start at £432# per annum rising to £480. and do not-6- receive houses or allowances. The figure suggested for junior teicners and instructors averages £^00. par annum which is about double what ti3e Bahrain Governiaent is now paying to headmasters and qualified technical tdachors. ..ccoiding to the actieme there i&amp;oula be o/ saasters teaching 500 boya, an average of 1 iaditer to 15*: boys. The aiaiual recurrent coat of the college is about 3 lakhs of rupees oi ^hich the jaiarain Govern- isent would have to pay half • Our present noraal expenditure on education in aaarain schools and several small auxiliary schools) is about U lakhs. The government would have to provide it lakhs yearly for the college in adaitioa to all female education (4 schools) all the village schools and probably schools in ^uharra^, Hedd and Mana^th. The village schools, though not spectacular, are of real value both educationally and politically. The Grulf College would confer no o^nefits to the greater part of the population Ahich lives in the villages outsiae the tao big tovms. in addition the govamiaent would have to pay about £17,000. for builaing and e mipment. It is realised that a suitable building for the present Kulliyah will have to be built, but not o'O the cost of £38,000. l£. The fsea for boarders, mentioned in section 14, are between £50 and £100. per uninm. Few parents would be found in Buhrain who would be willing to pay this amount for their sens 1 eduoatioc, in Bahrain. Hightly or wrongly the people of Bahrain considerthat it is the duly oi the ^overr^tent to provide their children * i h free or aLuost free 8duc «ation« i he pr ? iotice waxch usea to exiat of charging parents lor aohooi books has ao^ been tiboiished und all 3 ougo X s except the ^.uiiiyah are free, it h&gt; suggest-ad by J und a e that aay boys should pay betweea - £30, per iaiinuin. The Kuiliyah boys now pay 113. 6/- per moat a for 9 aoathij. The# boys at the Technical wChooi are paid by the govercjasat iiQ« lw/psi licauh Qi ,vhich whey receive Us# 10/'' por month and the Ltelaaoa ou leaving. The fees in the Kulliyah entail serious hardships on some of the parents and several boys are exempted or ar^ paying reduced fees, because their parents can not find the Mmey. The fees suggested by Dundas could not be obtained from Bahrain parents unaer present conditions. The .hole uestion of fees was carefully considered ana discussed ^Uh shaikh ,\bdullah when the Kulliyah m-o startea ana the fees now Dein^ charged were considered as uuica as one could hope to obtain at present* Tao annual cost of Duna^s' scheme, if adopted would therefore be far in excess of £^,000, since the expected revenue of between £5,0u0. and £10,000. would not materialise. 13. The time is not yet ripe for considering scholarshins from Bahrain schools to higher train ing collages abroad. The best educated boys are now at the ili.ilJiyah ana the oldsst of them are only 15. The essential pre- requisite for travelling scholarships is a sound general education .vhich tueseboys will not aciiisv© uiitii after aaotlior thi*8^ vtsars. xfr- i 14.

PU- ,x /y/*,Mr.Vallance came to see me today regarding his impending departure from Bahrain. He conveyed to me that MrOundas is not, as he would wish us to believe, in control of the part of the British Council in the Near East but that relations are carried on direct by the Council with the people to whom they make grants. I told him that we had nothing on record to show that Mr.iOundas was not in every way entitled to the position he claimed and the carbon copies of correspondence .that he sent us certainly appear to bear this out. 2. Mr♦Vallance considered that the desire of the Bahrain Government to part with his services was not their genuine wish but had been inspired, l told him that I had ascertained from Major ^Ibanthat he had done nothing further than to pasthe request which we had sent him to be informed whether the State desired to retain him or not, and 1 said that he had sent the request correctly through the Bahrain Government, with no expression of his own views. 1 pointed out that the marked preference of States for employees whom they knew over those whom they have never seen clearly showed that the State must have some strong reason for wishing to part with him. He told me that the State in this case was only, he felt sure, Shaikh Abdullah. 1 replied that that might be oorreotw &amp;mt since that Shaikh was the fflost influential one that was enough ii? itself. .3. Mr. Vallanoe asked me if i personally had anytriing against hiffl. J- told him that I thought that he was lacking in tact but that as regards his educational 'work I was not an expert and could not give any useful opinion. X also told him that if the State had made up / theirbH| , their minds i did not think that any useful object would he served by endeavouring to thwart their wishes since the Shaikhs would consider hia for ever afterwards as a protSg® of the Agency and dislike him accordingly. I told hia. however, that I would arrange to see Shaikh Abdullah, and discover if possible what the objections to Mr .Vallance were. If I found that he had objections and ^ that they were sincerely held, 1 told him that it would not be possible to do anything about it, but that if he had, for any reason, changed his mind since the view was originally expressed i would be prepared to re -open the matter. 3.7.41,D.0# N O.

He is a friend mine and I have great respect for him. He was a master on » staff of the College here for three years between 1933 and 1936 i during that time he proved himself quite efficient as a teacher average ability and was much appreciated by the boys and the iff. As Principal of the College I appreciated his work, tl should not have said that he had th'e experience or educational 3kground or the special ability to become a particularly good iucational Adviser 1 . But on the other hand he has had five irs more experience of life in general since then,and it would be eatly to his advantage to have had some knowledge and experience this part of the world, I think he would bring plenty of neral good sense and ability to his job and would be conscientious the exercise of his duties. He got on well with the Iranis d gained an elementary knowledge of the language. If,in factjyou want a man of outstanding ability d energy I think he hardly fills the requireitents,but if a man of erage ability and good common sense is wanted I think he would well.

In addition to holding special classes, notably in hospitals and the j aval Cadet College, teachers had the novel experience of instructing -British troops unable to speak English. * On the 16th April, being Wednesday in the Greek Holy Week, Lord Dunsany ' 06 1 lectured on the influence of the English Bible on English life and letters. On * the same day, a meeting of the English Preparatory School Committee was held, :fisl w ^ decided that the school should endeavour to carry on its work throughout the summer At that time there were sixty pupils at the school. iJ % • i n j 6 j TI .^ e S rav ity of the situation became clear and it was fleel; considered advisable to begin evacuation. During the next few days, all Council arid local teachers, including a number of Greeks, left for Crete and travelled thence m safety to Cairo. The Council representative remained in Athens until ' L \. anle ^0 22nd April, to supervise evacuation and place Council property in safe keeping- He then sailed to Crete with a final party, including the president of ^Anglo-Hellenic League, and, after assisting the legation in Crete for a few days, eventually reached Alexandria on the 6th May. 1 , 1 HjH Classes at the institutes in Nicosia, Kyrenia, Famagusta and Larnaca i? 0 ^continued with success until the end of the season in May.

The Council representative's collaboration with the Turkish Educational Authorities has continued to develop. In conjunction with the Board of Educa tion, the Council has met requests from the Turkish Minister of Education for copies of the board's publications dealing with the internal organisation of the board and of local educational authorities and other documents covering all branches of education. It is intended that the Board of Education regulations should be published in Turkish by the Ministry of Education. The president of the Board of Education has written to the Turkish Minister expressing his hope for even closer collaboration between Turkey and England in the educational field through the medium of the Council. _ At the same time, the Turkish Ministry of Agriculture, which at present depends predominantly on German publications, lias asked for the research reports and publications on agricultural education issued by the Australian Council of Agricultural Research. The Council has passed this request on to the Australian Council, and has invited the Education Departments of the other jretlmjDominion Governments and the Government of India to send to I ui key materia concerning all branches of their educational systems.

During that month, nine fixtures were held and there were the same number in May. These included 7 lectures, 5 concerts, 2 debates, 2 play-readings and 2 dances. Though many members were necessarily kept away by raids, the attendance at these engagements was satisfactory. At the end of May, membership totalled 1,095, representing an increase of about 100 over the total enrolled at the end of 1939-40. The season came to an end on the 19th June. The director's annual report shows that, during the past year, the institute has played a vital part in the • Jcultural life of the island.

A number of lectures have been given, among which that of the American Ambassador, Mr. Alexander ' ''''1 Wendell, was particularly popular. Foreign representatives from South America, Portugal and the Allied Governments were present as well as Spanish academicians and other distinguished Spaniards.

To the last-named books are sent in duplicate to enable the Institute Library to retain copies of some of the latest publications. miDSi ted Kiik msul-Gfi Coinii: Book Exhibitions. The text-book exhibition, which was to have been sent to Chile last autumn, was unfortunately delayed at the docks in this country owing to enemy action, and has only recently reached Santiago, too late for the occasion for which it was intended. The books, however, are being stored in Santiago for the present, and are to be exhibited twice—once to Chilean teachers at the end of the school year and again to the teachers at British Schools in Chile on the occasion of their in tie I; Summer Vacation Course, which will be held at the University of Santiago next January. A large exhibition of text-books for Colombia is at present being assembled. Translations in Sweden. English books have long been very popular in Sweden in both the original editions and in translations and are still in great demand. Ihe Council, with the assistance of the Ministry of Information, has been transmitting to Swedish publishers, through the press attache at Stockholm, any books which they wished to consider for translation. ^ooks for Resident Foreigners. The general distribution of books for resident foreigners has continued. A library has been supplied to the new Polish House m Edinburgh, many of the books being generously supplied by a Scottish publisher at low cost. Httdson Centenary. The centenary of W. H.

Letters of appreciation from ^ schools, native libraries and clubs are reaching the Council from all parts of the ^ Colonial Empire. The Director of Education in Basutoland, for instance, foresees' * \a liable results from the Councils action and the following comments from u 0c . the headmaster of Basutoland High School, Maseru, may be taken as typical of the enthusiasm with which English newspapers and magazines are greeted in v- the Colonies:— o &amp; teDtsiyj ' The periodicals are thoroughly enjoyed by the students and, in fact, '' '' J think many of the papers are surreptitiously slipped out of the library and M foi warded to their parents and friends, among whom, I hope, they continue . to do good work m disseminating British aims and ideals.'

' &amp; ^ders15 (f) Lectures. f 3T ^ V p lla | )lc ^ the lec tures given by the delegation from the University of Oxford ^ 1 ortug-al and by Mr. Hugh Ruttledge in the West Indies. It wdl be recollected that the delegation from the university visited Portugal to confer the degree of Doctor of Civil Law on his Excellency Dr. Antonio de Oliveira Salazar the delegation consisted of the president of Trinitv CGUege, M r - Weaver (representing the Vice-Chancellor), the Public Orator (Mr T. F Higham) and Professor W. J. Entwistle. The Council bore the greater part ot the cost of the visit (save that borne by the Portuguese Govern- ment) and made all he arrangements. 1 he delegation proceeded to Portugal and by invitation of the University of Coimbra a convocation was held there in order to confer the degree The Rector of Coimbra presided. Dr. Salazar was presented by the Public Orator m a formal Latin oration, the degree was conferred by Mr. Weavei and Dr. Salazar made reply in a Latin speech. The delegation were subsequently the guests of the rector at a luncheon where Dr. Salazar was present. In the afternoon, Professor Entwistle gave a public lecture in Portuguese, which Dr. Salazar attended. It is believed that Dr. Salazar s attendance was a compliment which had not previously been paid to a foreign lecturer. The members of the delegation were invited in turn to address the three universities of Lisbon, Oporto and Goimbra. They were also received privately and entertained to dinner by Dr. Salazar. On the'latter occasion His Maiesty's Ambassador, the Portuguese Minister of Education and representatives of the three universities were present. The dinner party was followed by a reception attended by representatives of every aspect of Portuguese culture. On this occasion the gardens of the San Eento Palace were illuminated for the first time since Dr. Salazar had taken up residence there. The delegates were also entertained by the Cardinal Patriarch of Lisbon and by His Majesty's Ambassador. Their expenses in Portugal were defrayed by the Portuguese Government. Most satisfactory publicity was given to the visit by the Portuguese press, where the movements of the delegation figured consistently as front-page news. Mr. Ruttledge delivered 31 lectures and broadcasts in the West Indies, British Guiana, British Honduras and Bermuda. His audiences were of many different kinds, both white and coloured, and ranging in number from 27 to 800. On a number of occasions he was introduced by the Governors of the respective Colonies. His visit was very successful and he brought back much useful information in regard to the possibility of work by the Council in the West Indies. (g) Music. The consignments of music and records sent to Spain and music to Malta in the last quarter were both lost owing to enemy action and are being replaced. The music sent out to Athens was intercepted at Cairo when Greece fell into enemy hands, and is now being used in Egypt. A small quantity of orchestral works, together with several hundred copies of part songs, were sent to the English School in Cairo. A further selection of orchestral material has been sent to Palestine for the Palestine orchestra; fifty song-books were sent to the institute in Jaffa for distribution there and in Tel Aviv. In May the Council hired the orchestral material of Ireland 's Piano Concerto for a concert in October in Goteborg. A foundation library of music was sent to the British Library of Information and Culture at Tokyo, and several choral works have been sent to the embassy in Chile, with further sets of the military band music which was sent out during the last quarter and proved ver y popular. Work among the resident foreigners' centres has increased : the song-books and radio originally sent to the British Council House in Liverpool were lost owing to enemy action and have been replaced; music of various kinds has been presented to a Netherlands band, a Gibraltarian centre, a Polish women's club, a Czechoslovak centre and a Danish hostel. Gramophone records have been lent or presented to a, large number of centres, and gramophones or pianos have been presented to others. Concerts, with artists including Mabel Ritchie, Winifred Radford, Geoffrey Ounn, Roy Henderson, Eda Kersey, Cyril Smith, Maurice Cole, Denis Mathews16 ilowi' 1 ! and Frederick Grinke, the London Madrigal Group, Antonia Butler and Kathleen Markwell and the Menges String Quartet, have been given to various' 5 refugee centres, as follows : Five at the Polish Hearth, one at the Czechoslovak' Institute, two at another Czechoslovak centre, two at the Danish Hostel and^'' three for Norwegian Seamen in London.

It has also recommended the publication of an illustrated brochure on British Engineering Achievement. This proposal was supported by the Engineering Panel at its first meeting on the 15th May. The brochure is being prepared. At its second meeting held on the 13th June, the Engineering Panel recommended that two or more short biographies of great British engineers should be published. Negotiations for one of these have been started. (j) Students. As the grant of scholarships to male students from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa has been suspended temporarily, it has been decided to mvite to this country four women graduates of Dominion Universities who Wj&gt;uld observe war-time' conditions in their particular field of research, i.e., in c ation, economics, public health, social service or medicine. An invitation has been addressed to the Turkish Ministry of Education to send a Turkish educationist to this country for the purpose of studying the British educational system and of lecturing on Turkish life and civilisation. A candidate11# for this mission has already been proposed by the Turkish Ministry. The arrange- ^ ments are being made in co-operation with the London School of Oriental Studies. ^ Eight applications have already been received from South American countries in response to invitations to study at Universities in the United Kingdom. Two post-graduate scholarships and three grants-in-aid to commercial students have been allocated to students from Iceland for the year 1941-42. The problem of the conditions of life of foreign students in this country in uf war-time, and particularly of students from Near Eastern countries, has been given special consideration during the period under review, and a plan of enter- tainment, hospitality and educational advice is being elaborated. Groo; The Council has arranged, with the collaboration of the Board of Extra-Mural Studies, for a Vacation Course at Cambridge in the English j,A language and British life and civilisation from the 16th July to the 6th August, itota Students from 23 different countries will attend. There will be approximately fifty students who are, or have been, studying in this country under the auspices pfl' 8 of the Council; there will be also some fifty representatives of Allied or German- jloref occupi ed territories. The following Council students have obtained employment during the period under review : — Mr. Dancheff (Bulgaria), part time work at B.B.C. Miss Rantavaara (Finland), employed at B.B.C.

Reports concerning the two Afghan Police students who have been training se ' with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have been so satisfactorv that His Excellency the Afghan Minister has agreed to their continuing their studies for a further period in order to take practical training. (k) Teaching. I ollowing the announcement in the last Quarterly Report that courses forBui certain teachers of English would be arranged with the School of Oriental Studies, -lands the Council s appointee to the Assistant Directorship of the Anglo-Uruguayan Institute in Montevideo took such a course for a month before proceeding to % Uruguay. A course of four lectures on the various problems arising in the teaching of English to foreigners was also arranged at the School of Oriental T Studies for sixteen of the teachers who are giving lessons to civilian refugees in ( the London area. c The following overseas appointments have been made during the quarter :— 1 Europe.

Regional Officers. Mr. Ernest Burbridge has been appointed Assistant Regional Officer for the English Midlands and Mid-Wales. Allied Air Units. The Council continued to work in close collaboration with the Air Ministry on the problem of educational facilities for Allied airmen. This collaboration has now been extended to cover not only the teaching of English and the supply of literature, but the provision of films and other facilities available through the Council. Allied Armies. At the request of the Director of Army Education and the Department of the Inspector -General of Allied Contingents, the Council has been making a survey of the educational and cultural needs of the Belgian Army, the Czechoslovak Hade, the Free French Forces, the Netherlands Brigade, the Norwegian Army and the Polish Army Reports resulting from these surveys are now being submitted to the War Office, and it is hoped that in the future the Council may ^ able to give more assistance to Allied nationals in the Allied Aimies.Oi s' 20 m tieco® 1 Internees. At the request of the Home Office, the Council continued to send lecturer^ n to the Isle of Man to lecture. In the last three months the following lecturers^ have visited the Island :— Mr. Stanley Wormald ; 'British Education.' Professor F. G. Tryhorn : ' British Science.' Mr. Sidney Wicks: 'English Literature' and 'The Eno-lish Tradition.' 8 Mr. G. G. Thomson: 'The British Sooial Services.' M -s-aj ' ■■iltCV The Council has also been asked to provide, at the expense of the Home Office, various facilities to centres in the London and Northern areas. A dmiralty. The Admiralty have recently asked the Council to appoint three teachers of izvi English to be attached to Allied naval units in ports in the United Kingdom. rGa The Admiralty have also circulated to port amenities liaison officers details of tion the type of facility that can be obtained from the Council for Allied naval im personnel, the cost being met by the Admiralty. Civilian Refugees and Allied and Neutral Merchant Seamen, 1. Teaching of English. The Council recently agreed that non-British nationals receiving tuition in English from British Council teachers should be encouraged to take the Cambridge 1 Certificate of Proficiency in English organised by the Local Examination^ at v, Syndicate in Cambridge. The syndicate have agreed to arrange special examinaffratio tions for British Council entrants and to reduce by half the fees for the examina -Umcia tion when taken by Allied service men and merchant seamen. During the last iff of quarter the following teachers of English have been appointed :— {im ii London and Home Counties (civilians) : 6 teachers (all part-time). Scotland (civilians): 6 teachers. ^fm\ South-West England (civilians and merchant seamen) : 1 teacher-organiser; ^ (civilians) : 2 teachers. 2. Film. Shows. Since the last report the following film shows have been arranged :- London and East A nglia— Merchant seamen Civilians South-West England and South Wales— Merchant seamen Civilians Northern— Merchant seamen Civilians Scotland— Merchant seamen Civilians 6 37C) 11 1 'mtian bkeil is faonals ' /( aitefui 9 10 3. Books and Periodicals. A number of the Council s pamphlets on ' British Life and Thought ' are to ™ Vfl e translated into Allied languages. In addition, a pamphlet of a simpler nature entitled See Britain, by Guy Ramsey, has been translated into all Allied anguages and is designed particularly for Allied merchant seamen and men serving with the forces. All over the country there is an unceasing demand for educational books |jL , ,( and books about Britain from non-British nationals of every category. (') Including Gibraltarian centres.■ 1t^ 21 bl lectures. ft has bee n possible particularly in London, to arrange some lectures on British Life and Institutions in national centres and hostels. As the knowledge rf English among non-British nationals in this country increases the need for such lectures becomes increasingly important. Art Exhibitions and Concerts. (n) Allied Art Exhibition.—On the 30th May the Secretary of State for Scotland opened an Allied Art Exhibition organised by the Council in the National Gallery ot Scotland with the generous permission of the director and trustees of the gallety. About 500 people attended the exhibition on the opening day, including representatives of the Allied Governments. The exhibition which is representative of all the Allies, is of a high standard and has already been visited by very large numbers of people. The President of Poland and Mme. Rackiewicz visited the exhibition in June and were received by the Director of the National Gallery and the Council's officer in Scotland. The exhibition will remain in Edinburgh until the end of July, after which it will be toured in Scotland and England under the auspices of C.E.M.A. Whilst the exhibition remains in Edinburgh a concert of Allied musicians is held every Wednesday evening in the National Gallery. So far concerts by Belgian, Czechoslovak, I rench, Polish and Yugoslav artists have been arranged. These concerts have been of an excellent standard and the average audience attending is in the neighbourhood of 300. (b) With the assistance of the Council's Music Committee, concerts have been arranged at various national centres, and in addition it has been possible, through co-operation with C.E.M.A., to provide concerts for Allied nationals in the main provincial centres. Arrangements have also been made to enable a limited number of non-British nationals to attend the daily concerts at the National Gallery in London. (c) Gramophone Concerts. —A number of gramophones and gramophone records have been presented, mainly to isolated forestry units. The majority of people employed in these units are of a high educational standard and appreciate music. Entertainments and Cultural Contacts. The Council is constantly asked to devise plans to enable a greater number of Allied nationals to visit British homes. Much work of this nature is, of course, done by a variety of organisations, but the Council is exploring the methods by which it may be further extended, and by which Allied airmen in particular may be afforded opportunities of spending their leave in peaceful and pleasant surroundings. Students and Children. (a) Students. —In co-operation with the Allied Governments and voluntary organisations, the Council is selecting students of Allied nationality for whom continued university or technical training is considered desirable. The Council is consulting with'the Universities to ensure that admission of non-British students into the Universities may be spread justly among the several nationalities and at the same time remain in accord with the Universities' general policy on admissions in war-time. Allied students who have received grants through the Resident Foreigners Division of the Council have been invited to a vacation course in Cambridge organised by the Council during July. &gt; (b) Children. —The trustees of the Moulton-Mayer Fund of the Royal College 0 f Music are very generously devoting the whole fund to the provision of one-year scholarships for children of non-British nationality, aged between 14 and 17 years. The Council has agreed to supplement this fund, and, m collaboration with the Allied Governments, is assisting the College to choose suitable candidates. The Council continued to be in close touch with various schools organised by the Allied Governments in the United Kingdom. Frequent visits are paid by the Council's officers to these schools, and besides provision of teachers of English an d educational equipment, it has been arranged for children from the Czecho- slov ak Boarding School to be entertained in Liverpool by a Liverpool girls'22 school - a group of boys from the Polish School have been entertained in Edinburgh ; Cr bv the Council; and the Council is also assisting in finding hospitality for children:: Vol from the French Lycee during the summer holidays. . • \lli National Centres. The Polish Hearth —Timing the past quarter the attendances at^the Polish pry 3 Hearth have been increased to between five and six hundred weekly. There have u been:- Pi n , 17 Concerts ... ... . v ••• ••• ••• ■; : 0 Lectures 6 ^ Dances ... ... ... ••• ••• o Bridge evenings 7 r;h CM . 1 • K -flUI W Social evenings ... ... ... o ^jucil an In addition, some 120 private Polish meetings were held on the premises and jr and an exhibition of Polish photographs which was opened by H.E. the President^teria of Poland. |iarea or Eleven English classes were held weekly, attended by some 70 students, and'^cen a course of Polish classes began in May. 'VS The Czechoslovak Institute. —During the past quarter there have been Lectures (19) : 7 (organised by Institute), 5 (by other leading societies) 7 (meetings of joint English and Czechoslovak societies). Dances ; 6. Social Evenings : 16 (13, every Monday, for members). M. Masaryk, Dr. Ripka and Mr. H. G. Wells were amongst the distinguished lecturers. Arrangements have been made whereby Czechoslovak soldiers visiting London on leave can receive advice on where to live and what to see in London. Hospitality for service men can also be arranged through the Institute. Besides the concerts held on alternate Sundays, a Music Club meets at the Institute every Tuesday with an average attendance of forty people. Women's meetings are held every Thursday. Items of especial interest have been an exhibition of photographs of Czechoslovakia and of paintings by Professor Matousek. Every Monday afternoon an 'At Home is held for members, with an average attendance of 100 Czechoslovak and English people. Fifteen English classes are held weekly at the Institute, and a library has been organised under the direction of a trained Czechoslovak librarian. Several generous donations of books have been made to the library by Czechoslovak and British nationals. In addition, a fine collection of pictures by Czechoslovak artists has been lent to the Institute for the duration of the war. Many of these pictures are at the moment on loan to the Allied Art Exhibition in Edinburgh. The Allied Centre, Liverpool. —This Centre was opened by the Duchess of Kent on the 22nd April and completely destroyed by enemy action on the 2nd May. A new Allied Centre has now been created, once more in excellent premises. In the interval the Council's work in Liverpool was carried on without a break from temporary premises. The last function in the original centre was a very successful celebration of the Polish National Day, attended by the Lord Mayor of Liverpool. Celebrations of the Norwegian National Day were carried through successfully from temporary premises. The anxiety expressed by the people of Liverpool for the speedy recreation of the Centre and. equally important, the fact that the Allied nationals and merchant seamen followed the Centre from its original premises to its temporary premises and now to the new premises in great numbers, have greatly encouraged the Council. It is of interest to note that a number of Yugoslav seamen have attended daily English classes at the Centre and were given a lunch by the Council's officers before their departure. The Scottish-Polish House. —The Scottish-Polish House was opened on the 1st June in Edinburgh by the Rt. Hon. Lord Elgin. Here a regular programme of lectures, music and film shows is arranged; a teacher of English is permanently attached, and organises English classes for Polish nationals, including children, in Edinburgh. Classes in Polish are also held for Scottish people.23 *11.:: '• ie I tlH 'toe Is jn JuneaNorwe^anSeame^s Hostel and Club was opened in a northern f ?\T v • o 06 Norway. These premises have been provided by the ISoiwegian Government, the Council having co-operated in the provision of libraries and educational equipment. A Club for Allied and Neutral seamen is being created in another northern port jointly by the Norwegian and Dutch Governments, the Council and various Scottish voluntary associations. The Belgian House. In collaboration with the Belgian Government the Council has agreed to the creation of a Maison Beige in London. A committee composed of representatives of the Belgian Government, the Foreign Office and the Council are seeking suitable premises. Evacuees from Gibraltar. The Council ait now in touch with all the centres established for evacuees from Gibraltar and have arranged film shows at many of the centres. Much educational material 1ms been supplied, and excursions to places of interest in the London area organised. The Council is also encouraging the teaching of English at these centres and. in collaboration with the L.C.C., is examining the need for secondary school education and technical training. the distit : solcfer; &gt;0 see inbi st k :gsl) 3r meitel e. by Cfflt , Maui I i inldiE , the fc- jtiofl ^ [ceEentf® nl celetfj nl.

For this reason I wrote to Kegan Paul to send a copy of the handbook to the Resident, and by this week's mail I see that at long last it has been done. Unfortunately the Resident has departed so it is too late for him to get the pleasure of seeing the book, which will be lying at Bushire; so if there is no use for it, would you mind sending it to me, and I will get our Educational Department to look it over.

Dear Sir, Following the suggestion you made during our conversation yesterday on the subject of the Technical School, I am sending herewith in advance three copies of my letter to the Adviser and the lists of equipment and materials which we require to import. and materials required for immediate use is little more than Rs. 20000/- (£ 1600), a sum which the Bahrain Govern ment would no doubt spend at once if the goods were available. I shall look forwrd to hearing through Mr. Belgrave that the Export Controller in India has made us a concession. My rough estimate of the cost of the equipment Yours very truly, Principal.; j'-f ) Government Technical School, B A H R A I U . 26th October 1941 The Adviser to the Bahrain Government. Dear Sir, I^am submitting lor your information -the attached list oi machinery and other equipment required for the Technical School. The list contains only those items of equipment which are urgently needed, and which must be specially imported. The new equipment, together with that which is already in use, represents the minimum required for a school of 120 apprentices, that is the number at present in the school plus another 50 to be entered in 1942. The capacity of the school, working on a 2-years course, should be from 130 to 200 boys, a number .vhicn r.ight be reached by 1944. It may not, however, be considered necessary at the present time to equip fully for this number# I believe that all the items of equipment I have specified are obtainable in India, e .g., through an agent such as Machine Tools (India), Ltd. They would only be supplied, of course, if the necessary export permits could be obtained. Certain of the specifications given in the list allow for considerable latitude in the choice of the item in question. In the present state of the market it is impossible to say whether goods of a particular make or'design can be supplied. The suitability of goods approximating to the specifications, and available in the market at the time of ordering, will have to be decided in conference or in correspondence with the suppliers. Likewise prices mentioned in my list represent only roughly the probable cost. They may be more or less according to the type of goods offered and the country of their origin. Also I have not allowed for the cost of shipment from India. At the request of II. E. the Political Resident I have sent him a complete copy of this communication direct in order that he may have the information before his departure from Bahrain to-day. Yours very truly, Signed G.E. Ilutchings. Principal. Copy to H .E. the Political Resident, c/o H.3.M. Political Agency, Bahrain.
