Government that he will have no objection to recognising the Eastern limits of King Ibn Baud’s territory as being defined by the line joining the points C, D, E, G, H, and I. be as well if a communication were addressed to the Sultan mentioning, inter alia , that His Majesty’s Government have taken note of the fact that while he cannot state precisely the limits of his claims, he at any rate lays no claim to any territory beyond the points D, E, G, and H (the points C and 1 do not really affect him). This will serve to narrow down any controversy which might possibly arise when, and if, the new oil concession recently granted to Petroleum Concessions Limited comes to be exploited, and may help us to secure an eventual definition of the inland boundary of the Sultanate. 4. Incidentally, the use of letters of the alphabet for describing potential frontiers is convenient enough in its way, but if the same letter is used at different times for different geographical points owing to changes in the suggested frontier line, the letters are apt to become a source of confusion. We therefore suggest that these points should be E. We do not know whether you have yet considered what reply, if any, should be sent to the Sultan of Muscat’s letter of 4th May to Watts, in which he makes it known to His Majesty’s 3.

CONFIDENTIAL. [E 7572/258/91] December 28, 1937. Section 4. Copy No. 1 0 7 Sir R. Bullard to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Jedda).—{Enclosure in Jedda despatch No. 175 of December 4, 1937; received in Foreign Office December 28.) (After compliments.) Your Royal Highness, Jedda, December 4, 1937. I HAVE the honour to inform your Royal Highness that according to recent reports which have reached His Majesty’s Government, it appears that the Standard Oil Company of California (California Arabian Oil Company) are prospecting in the neighbourhood of Qasr-al-Salwa. The views of His Majesty’s Government with regard to the frontier in the said area have already been com municated to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, and His Majesty’s Government are prepared to reopen negotiations for a settlement on the lines they have indicated. They assume that in the meantime no attempt will be made by the California Arabian Company to pass the line defined in the latest proposals of His Majesty’s Government to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz so long as no final agreement has been reached as to that line. Since, however, there is some uncertainty as to the precise position of certain of the physical features concerned, His Majesty’s Government propose that a joint Anglo-Saudi Topographical Mission should be appointed to establish on the spot the exact nature and position of those features. x ^ To obviate misunderstanding, I beg to repeat the relevant proposals of His f Majesty’s Government as made under the first four headings of the note winch pA cW - Sir Andrew Ryan communicated to his Excellency Fuad Bey at Riyadh on the 25th November, 1935 (the references can be followed on the map, of which two copies were handed to his Excellency Yusuf Yasin on the 24th March) :— (1) A straight line starting from a point on the coast of the Dohat-as-Salwa 4 miles to the north-east of the point on the sea coast closest to Qasr- as-Salwa, and running due south-east for 10 miles. (The terminal of this line is indicated as key-point A.) (2) A line from key-point A to a point (key-point B) midway between Haluwain and Nakhala, to be drawn as straight as possible, but so as to leave to Abu Dhabi the following places, namely, Nakhala, Aqlat- al-Manssir, Earhud, Rimth, Khafus and the route from Doha to Abu Dhabi, which passes west of Sabkhat-al-Amra, and to leave to Saudi Arabia the following places, namely, Haluwain, Eil Deirish and Raghuwan. (3) A straight line from key-point B to the intersection of meridian, 52 degrees east, with parallel 23 degrees north (key-point C). (4) A straight line from key-point C to the intersection of meridian, 55 degrees east, and parallel 22 degrees 30 minutes north (key-point J). Since the above proposals were made by Sir Andrew Ryan in November 1935, there has been a modification in favour of the Saudi Arabian Government in that it has been discovered that Sufuk (Safaq) is much farther north than is shown on the map referred to above, and that in consequence key-point C and the proposed boundary in that region are in reality much nearer the coast than they appear to be on the map. This fact was brought to the knowledge of his Excellency Yusuf Yasin in a letter which I wrote to him on the 27th March, 1937; In conclusion I wish to assure your Royal Highness of the desire of my Government to arrive at a settlement on this point and thus to approach still closer to the moment when all questions outstanding between the two Governments will have been cleared up.

Several papers from Bushire on files bear out Iton Saud’s statement that/ gmmmmthat it is he and not our friends who administerp at least the first two of points in dispute* I axa aware that historical case goes much further back and that settlement by tribal interchange has been ruled out* vVhat I want to avoid is forcing issue while international situation is so disturbed and I think it would be worth while to refrain from prospecting in disputed area and to drag out negotiations and wait better times* Uould we not reply in sense of follow ing paragraph ? 3* His Majesty , s Government are glad to learn of instructions which have been given to Oil Company operating in Hasa. They cannot see how it is possible to make any further concession in regard to a frontier which they adopt in accordance with customary and essential needs of Arab states concerned but in a spitit of conciliation they will see that Oil Company operating in those states does not enter the disputed territory for the present. ihey do not share view that proposed mission is pointless since their contention is that Saudi claim is based in part on incorrect topograph ical data. Object of mission would not be to bind either side but to establish certain facts and His Majesty's Govern ment trust Saudi Arabian Government will agree to its des patch . 4. Use of phrase “for the present 1 * would show that His Majesty's Government were not necessarily prepared to prevent prospecting in disputed area until conclusion of an agreement with Ibn 3aud. 5.

There is a passage in the middle of the last paragraph but one (“ they do not believe that the company’s employees will go beyond what my Government believe to be within their territories ”) which implies that the company may operate in the disputed territory. I am sure that this is not what the writer meant, and I am trying to clear up the point, but Fuad Bey is at Mecca and there is not time to settle the matter before the bag goes. 2. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bush ire and to the External Affairs Department of the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. ,0 a* Enclosure. Minister for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty's Minister. (Translation.) (After compliments.) Mecca, Shawwal 16, 1356 (December 19, 1937). I HAVE the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 195 of the 4th December (1st Shawwal 1356) regarding the question of the frontiers between the Saudi Arabian Kingdom and the Arab amirates on the Persian Gulf, and the proposal of the British Government based on information which has reached them to the effect that the geologists of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company have begun prospecting in the neighbourhood of Qasr Salwa. You have been so good as to refer to the views of the British Government as to the frontier line in that region, and to their readiness to reopen negotiations with a view to reaching a settlement on the basis which they have already explained to the Government of His Majesty the King, subject to the proviso that they trust that, pending a final settlement, the employees of C.A.S.O.C. will not go beyond the frontier indicated by the British Government. The British Government have, moreover, suggested that a joint topographical mission should be formed to ascertain the position of some of the natural features of the places situated near that line. The Government of His Majesty the King welcome the idea of opening negotiations with a view to arriving at a settlement of the frontier line in that region. They have always been ready to show their good intentions and disposed to come to an agreement and an understanding. I am compelled, however, to observe to your Excellency that the failure to arrive at an agreement in the past was not due to any lack of desire on the part of the Government of His Majesty to settle the question. The difficulty arose from their inability to agree to the renunciation of their established rights in the territories included in the definition of the frontier, which they put forward through Sir Andrew Ryan, and which represented the moderate and reasonable minimum for their frontiers. Whenever an opportunity presented itself my Government have explained the essential reasons which compelled them to adhere to the frontier which they had explained in the note which was communicated to Sir Andrew Ryan by the Deputy Minister [205 aa—3] S lc&gt; R' ^ ^ k* (Xv tv et tv L &lt; /vlo 'III “'S 'A , i | “Cwnr w-2 M for Foreign Affairs on 29/12/1353 (3rd April. 1935). As, however the British Government, in spite of the evidence and on other occasions, the last of them being * e . for Fo ? e “n and the recent conversation between you and the Deputy Minister tor to eign Affair still adhere to the frontier mentioned m your above-mentioned note the GoVernment of His Majesty consider -the possibility of arriving at a final settlement very difficult so long as the British Government hold to their position and do not agree to the actual situation of what is in reality in the possession and under the influence of His Majesty the King. If, however, the British Govern ment are prepared to open the subject and to seek a solution on the basis of the actual facts-a solution which would obviate the difficulty-nothing would be more agreeable to the Government of His Majesty , , , . n • , r , g As to the employees of C.A.S.O.C. not going beyond the places still in dispute, His Majesty’s Government had already explained to the company s representa tive the actual situation as arrived at with your Government and had informed him of the points still in dispute, and they do not believe that the company s employees will beyond what my Government believe to be within their territories, just as they believe that the responsible authorities m the Arab amirates on the Persiab Gulf, for their part, will not allow the representatives or employees of the companies operating in their territories to cross the line laid down in the note to Sir Andrew Ryan, until a final agreement has been concluded between the parties concerned. . . „ As to the despatch of a topographical mission to fix the position ot certain natural features in the areas in dispute, my Government do not know how those difficulties can be overcome which were explained by the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs in the conversation which he had with you on Friday, the 10th December (7th Shawwal 1356), and would prefer to learn the opinion of the British Government, whether they do not share the point of view of the Saudi Government that it would be advisable to come to a final settlement of the frontier, whether by specifying places or by specifying lines of latitude and longitude, before proceeding to make a survey. I therefore beg you to be so good as to explain the point of view of my Government on the subject to the British Government and to acquaint me with their views upon it. FAISAL.

But His Majesty’s 'government had mads it clear to Ibn Baud that, while this remained the legal position* \ m ii they were .puite ready to reach a comaonsense settlement of the frontier based on the facts of the situation as they existed to-day. They therefore were prepared not to press their claims t 5 certain territories to the oaet of the blue line* which were in fact wandered over by tribes owing allegiance to Ibn Baud. &gt;ut no settlement of the frontier had yet been reaoWU On the other hand His Majesty’s Government 'had definite treaty obligations to th Arabian rulers aider their protection* and in particular to the Sheikha of atur and b , Dhabi.

Having regard to importance of I bn Baud’s attitude to Great Britain both in matter of Palestine and in connection with issues formulating out of European political situation His Majesty’s Government nave nad under examination proposals which might help to secure his goodwill and remove possible sources of friction. One of the few possibilities for an advance in this direction is a settlement of disputed south eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia, here agreement has so far proved impossible owing to the persistent claim of Ibn Baud to JEBEL NAKSH and KHOR AL ODAID which His Majesty’s Government have so far refused to admit. It is desired however to examine the possibility of making some further concession to Ibn Baud’s claims which might be conducive to an agreement place among Departments concerned. It is of course realised that this same question was gone into carefully a year ago and that no further concession to Saudi claim, apart from modification of frontier near SUFUK, was then found possible. But question was then examined mainly as a part of frontier problem and not against background of wider issues of policy to which His Majesty’s Government now attach special importance. upon frontier question. V 2 A delimitation discussion has accordingly taken- 2 - 3. Of tile two Saudi claims it is recognised tJiat tilere is no prospect of making any concession in respect of Jebel Naksii whicii is piiysically part of JBBEL DUKHAN and therefore of Qatar and which is covered by oil concession granted with approval of nis Majesty's (iovernment to Petroleum Concessions ^ ?Khor al udaid) and question has been raised whether obstacles which have hitherto been held to prevent any concession to Ibn Saud in respect of this territory can by any means be overcome apart from principal difficulty caused by recognition of the ownership of Abu Dhabi (see Political Resident's Express letter of March 5tn 1937 no.U/10 paragraph x^OoS (ii)J # the objections to permitting Ibn Saud to occupy Khor al Odaid which have been advanced in the past were stated l\sl) $ in Record of discussion at Foreign Office with Saudi Representa tives on June 24th 1935 (enclosure in Foreign Office letter of July 3rd 1935 copy sent to India and Bushire by air mail of July 5th)• The Service Departments here are of opinion that there are now no strategical objections to occupation of Khor al Odaid by Ibn Saud and I should be glad to have your views and those of Political Resident on the question how far political objections remain valid. 5* The main difficulty however is constituted by recognised rightis of Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. The guarantee given to the Shaikh in 1906 was in unambiguous terms and should presumably be regarded as a solemn engagement. Any concession to Ibn Saud could therefore be made only by previous agreement with Shaikh. fhether concession of Khor al Odaid would have value as a factor in securing Ibn Saud's goodwill and in bringing about a frontier settlement is still an open question and views of his Majesty's Minister at Jedda on this aspect are /are being sought but idea obviously can only be persued if ——— — ——C3F there is a reasonable prospect of securing medium‘agreement and I shall be glad to have your views and those of Political Resident on the feasibility of approaching Snaikn and c&lt;n si dera tions which might influence him to agree to cession to I bn Ss.ud of this part of his territory. There should of course at this stage be no consultation with Shaikh or his family. 6# It is recognised that it would hardly be possible to ask Abu Dhabi to surrender his rights except in return for some compensating advantage. As regards possibility of offer ing monetary compensation his Majesty* s government would probably experience at any rate if no insuperable difficulty in making funds available for the purpose# It has been suggested however that it might be possible to demonstrate to Shaikh that it is in his own interests that there should be a settled frontier between his territory and Saudi Arabia j that His Majesty’s Government have so far failed to reach an agreement with I bn Saud owing partly to latter*s insistence on his claim to Khor al Odaid and that cession of this territory, which is presumably of no material value to Abu Dhabi^/ould be a price well worth paying for an agreed frontier# It is not contemplated that if Shaikh should agree to the Knor being handed to Ibn Saud the cession should take place except in exchange for a frontier settlement which Ibn Saud would agree 'f to respecttimportance of such settlement to Abu Dhabi would be that it would set a definite limit to Saudi expansion wnich it may perhaps be anticipated t i compare last part of paragrapn o of ^ sf ^ Hickinbotham’s letter of August 27th 1937 T/lOJ-22/4) is other wise likely to increase towards Trucial Coast and which failing a frontier settlement now may result in some years hence in more /-4- 7 ^ more extensive territorial claims on tne part of the Saudis e*g* possibly in the direction of 2&amp;RAIMI or in unfortunate and possibly dangerous friction in the event of discovery of oil. I should be glad to learn in this connection your present view of the danger of expansion of Saudi or Wahabi influence on Trucial Coast hinterland and whether it constitutes a menace that Shaiich^s) would be anxious to dispel at cost of cession of territory* 7 0 if you think above and any other considerations you may be able to suggest would be insufficient to persuade Shaikh v/ithout some degree of monetary compensation can you estimate what cash payment by His Majesty’s (xovernment need in that case be required to secure his agreement ? Bo Further do you think Shaikh is likely to insist 0 n a frontier settlement being accompanued by a guarantee of protection by His majesty’s Government on landward side of nis territory ? The possibility of giving most desirable clear ness has not yet been considered here and in view ot its obvious difficulties would require very careful examination. 9* I should also be glad to learn your views on adequacy of a frontier settlement on a de facto ba ^ ) s ^see Ho*24) in tne event of Ibn Saud being unwilling to sign a definite treaty settling frontier* would refuse to commit himself in any way to a frontier whicn does not concede to him the JEHSL UAKSH.

IN my despatch No. 187 dated the 28th December, with which I had the honour to transmit to you a translation of the Saudi note on the question of the eastern frontier, I pointed out that the wording of the last paragraph but one of that note would allow prospecting in the disputed area from the Saudi side but not from the Persian Gulf side, and that I was trying to clear up this point. The wording seemed to me neither logical nor in accordance with what Fuad Bey had said to me in an assurance which I reported to you in my telegram No. 92 dated the 11th December. I suggested to Fuad that if in the phrase “ They do not believe that the company’s employees will go beyond what my Government believe to be within their territories ” the words italicised could be replaced by a reference to the frontier as defined in the proposals of His Majesty’s Government, the note would express what I understood to be the Saudi Government’s point of view. Fuad Bey, however, sent me a letter dated the 25th December (translation enclosed) containing the proposal for mutual abstention from operations in the disputed area which I conveyed to you in my telegram No. 103 of the 30th December. 2. For some time I hoped to induce Bey to withdraw his letter of the 25th December and to return to the note of the 19th December, with the amend ment which I had proposed. It would have been better for the Saudi Arabian Government to say “ We do not think our prospectors will go east of your line and we assume that your prospectors will not come west of ours,” rather than to of the 25th December, with its proposal that mutual abstention on the Saudi side should be dependent upon abstention on our side. Fuad Bey’s behaviour has been peculiar about this point. He admits that he gave me the oral assurance reported in my telegram No. 92 dated the 11th December. From one or two indirect remarks he has made I can only conclude that Ibn Saud and Yusuf Yasin con- the King to give in writing an unconditional assurance such as he had himself given me orally. However this may be, the letter of the 25th December remains the last word in writing and I send it to complete the record, though I shall quote, if need arises, the oral assurance given by Fuad on the 11th December. From what Fuad has said on more than one occasion, and from statements made by the Jedda manager of the California-Arabian Standard Oil Company, I do not fear that there will be any prospecting in the disputed area by the C.A.S.O.C. at present. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire, and to the Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi. make the one dependent upon the other, as they have done in the letter now trans- . . y mitted to you.

Fuad Hamza Bey to Sir R. Bullard. m k (Translation.) Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Dear Sir Reader, Mecca, December 25, 1937. I HAVE referred to the text of the second paragraph of the note sent to you on the 19th December, 1937, concerning the south-eastern frontiers, and I now explain the object (of that note) to you. The position of my Government is clear in her adhering to and insisting on their established right over the whole of the territory bounded by the frontier defined in the note communicated to Sir Andrew Ryan on 29.12.1353 (3rd April, •y 1935), and consider that there is nothing to prevent them from allowing the ' representatives of the O.A.S.O.C. from making a geological or topographical survey within that frontier, especially if the news we have received is taken into consideration, that the representatives of the companies which are operating in the amirates on the Persian Gulf have violated that frontier. If, however, those Governments agree to refrain from violating the frontier until a final agreement has been arrived at as to the places in dispute, my Government will be prepared to inform the representatives of the company of the necessity not to violate frontier described by the British Government as the green line, either for drilling or for prospecting operations.

Eventually I decided against official action. I suggested to Fuad that he should give me his personal opinion as to the sort of solution which he thought might be acceptable to his Government and I would think it over and give my personal views on the possibility of its acceptance by His Majesty’s Government. In tnis way neither Government would be committed. 2. Fuad took several days for reflection during which he probably sounded the King* After much talk during which I had to steer him away from expressing a definite preference for Jabal Nakhsh he put this forward as a solution which might have some hope of acceptance by Ibn Saud: (1) His Majesty’s Government to offer to abandon to Ibn Saud whichever of the two areas Jabal Nakhsh and Khor al Odaid they consider the less important; S His Majesty’s Ambassador, Jedda.

I will not repeat all Fuad’s appeals as I know His Majesty’s Government are anxious to do anything they can within reason at the present moment but will only remind you this is a point on which Ibn gaud is terribly sensitive and that I believe offer of this compromise would have a good chance of success.

Paragraph 4- of nr* Calvert’s letter of Seat ember 26th 1656 to bheikh Yusuf Yasin was never intended to contain assurance that fatar oil concession did not extend beyond maximum line claimed by King Ibn Saud. Relevant sentence makes it clear that southern limit of oil concession does not extend beyond w green^line w from which in fact it lies some distance to the north. Second sentence to the effect that i( concession does not therefore extend to any territory under discussion with Saudi Government” is merely a corollary of the first and was based on repeated assertions by His majesty’s Government that they were not prepared to discuss any concession beyond the green line. 5. Jebel Nakhsh had in fact been included in concession area before there was any indication that Ibn Saud intended to claim it and concession line was thought at the time to be well away from further extent of any serious Saudi claim, although it was realised that Ibn Saud had at times claimed practically the whole of r atar Peninsula. 4. Although it is unfortunate that phrase used in hr. Calvert’s letter (which, however, exactly followed norei&amp;n Office instructions) should have given the irmoression that Qatar con cession did not cover any territory claimed by Ibn Saud, I distrust Fuad's motives in asking these questions and should much prefer to avoid embarking on legalistic discussion which is unlikely to further solution. I can, however, only leave it to your discretion whether and if so how to reply to Fuad s communication. 5.

Dear Baggallay, Would you please refer to your letter of the 25th January and to the drafts which you sent me of two telegrams addressed to Jedda on the subject of the S.E.boundaries of Saudi Arabia. We concur in the draft reply to the Minister’s ^ r icy telegram No * 26 of the 21st January (F. 0.No.E. 407/150/91). As regards the draft reply to his telegram No.14 (F.O.No.E.220/150/91) we have no comments to make except with regard to the last paragraph. We did not know to what this paragraph referred, and we felt we could hardly agree to it without some further information. You haye now given us this on the telephone and we understand that after consultation with Starling you propose to modify the latter part of the paragraph so as to indicate that there is practically no possibility of an arrangement being made between the two Oil Companies, and I have told you that we take no exception to the paragraph as so modified. We should, however, be glad to learn a bit more precisely what kind of n co-operation” between the two companies is, or was, in contemplation. When the telegrams issue we should in the usual way send copies to the Political Resident and the Government of India for their information, and as the paragraph referred to above would mystify them we would, of course, wish to be able to explain the actual position. We assume of course that in view of our connexion with the grant of the Qatar Oil Concession and our responsibility for the operation of the Political Agreement 'aggallay, Esq., with/ eign Office,2 .

Dear Gibson, p.m ■ In reply to your letter P.Z.567/38 of the 31st January about the south-eastern boundaries of Saudi Arabia, Bullard which you mention referred to a personal enquiry addressed to the Chairman of the Iraqi Petroleum Company. The enquiry was whether in the Chairman^ personal opinion it would be possible, so far as the Company^ own interests were concerned, for the Company to reach an agreement with the American company which holds the concession for eastern Saudi Arabia, whereby the two companies would dispose of the profits, if any, from the exploitation of the Jebel Nakhsh area in such a manner as to render possible, merely so far as concerned the Company^ own interests, a change in the Qatar frontier. Ihe answer now received is that no such arrangement is possible. In any case there would have been no question of taking the matter up with the Company with a view to positive action on their part, far less of taking it up with the Sheikh of Qatar, without the concurrence of the India Office.

I explained that we regarded the legal poeition as established by the A«glo-^urkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914, ^Uch defined the blue and violet linos. In practice, however, Ibn saud had established hi® authority © long way to the east of these lines, and we did not desire to insist on purely legal paper claime over areas wandered over exclusively by tribes, such as the hurra, owing undisputed allegiance to Ibn iaud. on V^e other hand, we had certain obligations to the theikh of p.fcar and the Trucial siieikhs, end we had therefore made an of 'or to Ibn 3aud defining our maximum c oncesei ms# We had told Ibn jaud and the Standard Oil Company of California thet we would raise no objection to that Company operating up to our maxinu® line, but had warned them against crossing that line, • nich we had re-defined both to Ibn gaud and to the Company* 5. Mr. Longrigg then told me that the Sheikh of b ■■ w? s proving extremely difficult to deal with and appeared to be in great awe of Ibn Smid. I ©eked Mr. Longrigg how far he thought the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi’s effective authority extended.

ATTESTED for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.the honour to receive your permission to tell the Jedda manager of the California Standard Arabian Oil Company informally of the present position in regard to the eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia. I saw Mr. Lenahan on December 11th. and gave him the information in question. He expressed his thanks, and said that the Saudi Government had already explained about the territory in dispute and had told them not to enter it. He added that while his Company naturally wanted the question to be settled and would be the better pleased the more the territory covered by their concession, they’ were very anxious not to enter disputed territory and had given their representatives on the spot strict instructions to that end. He himself had wondered whether the prospecting party had perhaps entered the disputed area by mistake and caused the British Government to protest, since about six weeks earlier the Governor of Hasa had suddenly recalled the prospecting party to Banaiyan. I said that the recall of the prospecting party could not be connected with the recent communication of His Majesty’s Government to the Saudi Government, which had only just been made. 2. As I had spoken to Mr. Lenahan for his confidential information I was rather surprised when, a few days later, Fuad Bey referred to the matter, having heard of it from Mr. Lenahan. Fuad Bey said that the King was hurt because our action suggested that we did not trust him to do what was right. ght Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., II said that there was no question of distrust. Nor did His Majesty's Government arrogate to themselves the right, as Fuad Bey seemed to think they did, to give instructions to a foreign company operating in Saudi territory 0 All over the world there was commercial competition Between British and American oil companies, and it was natural that information should he given them in such cases as that of the qatar frontier. Fuad Bey said that the Saudi Government considered that the frontier question was Between Governments 0 They could not object to our keeping in touch with the United States Government on the matter, if we wished to do so, But they did object to our speaking to the company and thereby, as they considered, interfering in a matter which lay Between them and the Company, and they would make a protest in writing, 3. By way of showing the friendly attitude of the Saudi Government Fuad Bey said that the prospecting party had entered the disputed zone But were given orders to withdraw on receipt of my note of December 4tho This is at variance with what Mr, Lenahan said, and I am inclined to disbelieve it. 4. Enclosed is a translation of a written protest dated January 10th but received on January 17th. I am telling Fuad Bey that the letter is being forwarded to His Majesty's Government and pointing out that there is no question of our having discussed the frontier question with the Corqoany, who were merely kept informed of the situation. 5. Mr. Lenahan professed great regret at having raised this issue by mentioning the matter to Fuad Bey, and excused tvmt he had not understood that I was himself on the ground that ne nuu speaking to him confidentially. Mr. Lenahan is not intelligent and not always sober, and his excuse may be genuine. On the other hand Fuad Bey already knew unofficially from Mr.Lenahan that the Foreign Office had spoken to Mr. Hamilton in London and\%0 and was waiting for Mr. Lenahan to get so officially so^that he could ac±_--c&gt;n the information. The wording of the written protest suggests that Mr. Lenahan has now obtained that permission,, According to Mr. Lenahan, Fuad Bey seemed personally annoyed to learn that communications had passed behind his back, and this agrees with what one knows of Fuad Bey. On the other hand the suggestion that our communicating with the Company might be interpreted as indicating distrust of the Saudi Government might well have come from the King. 6 . I can only suggest that a written reply should be sent to the Saudi Government repeating more or less what I have said orally. The reply might say that the communication between His Majesty’s Government and the California Standard Arabian Oil Company was not based on any distrust of the Saudi Arabian Government but was in accordance with the practice where important oil companies, whether of the same or different nationalities, are operating in adjoining areas; and that His Majesty’s Government have had no discussions with the Company, but have, merely conveyed information to them, and therefore regret that the Saudi Arabian Government should take exception to what is a normal procedure intended to ensure the maintenance of good relations between the great oil companies and the countries in which they are registered.

The companies act according to the instructions issued to them by the governments concerned in the territories /in question^/, and it is therefore much to be desired that the Company should not be brought into the question and that the British Government should avoid discussion with the California Company on a subject which concerns the Government of His Majesty alone. The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs has explained to you the interpretations which might be placed upon the interference of the British Government / in dealing_/ with the Company direct in this matter, and my Government therefore hope that the British Government will put this right in future. (Signed) Faisal,No» 10 (139/546/13) of 23rd January in regard to the activities of the California Standard Arabian Oil Company in the neighbourhood of the Qatar frontier. 2. You will recall from Sir John Simon f s despatch No*ll2 of 19th March 1934 9 that early in that year the United States Embassy in Angora made informal enquiries of His Majesty's Embassy regarding the treaty instruments governing the frontiers separating the former Ottoman Dominions and the territories to the east and south thereof. Some three months later the United States Embassy in London made similar enquiry of my department in connexion with the aircraft which the California Standard Arabian Oil Company were then proposing to use for survey work over the area of their concession in Eastern Saudi-Arabia* and it was discovered that the enquiries in Angora had in fact been made in connexion ^ GY' /'•pT'V-v with this oil company's concession. (See Foreign Office despatch to Jedda No. 166 of 25th April 1934). Care was taken to explain to the United States Embassy in London, for the information of the oil company, that the legal frontier of Saudi Arabia in this area was the ’’blue line” and the Saudi Arabian Government were subsequently infomed that His Majesty's Gove mment ider Bullard, K.C.M.G., C.I.E.,) I Y&gt; ^ Government had made this communication to the United States Government (jedda despatch No.130 of 28th April 1934). 3. Since those communications His Majesty’s Government have not informed either the United States Government or the Saudi Arabian Government that they no longer regard the ’’Blue 'line” as the legal frontier or that the oil company is free to operate to the east of that line. His Majesty’s Government would, I feel, have been justified in protesting to the Saudi Arabian Government when they learnt that the concessionary oil company, in spite of their original communication to the Saudi Arabian Government, were operating in the neighbourhood of Qasr-es-Salwa. On the contrary, out of deference to King Abdul Aziz, and in their desire to do all they could to facilitate matters for him and for the company operating in his territory, His Majesty’s Government refrained from making any conplaints either to the United States Government or to the Saudi Arabian Government and they confined their action to informing the interested representatives of the oil company quite informally, that notwithstanding their previous communications to the United States and Saudi Arabian Governments,they would raise no objection to the company operating to the east of what His Majesty’s Government still regarded as the legal eastern frontier of Saudi Arabian territory. The only condition made was that the company should refrain from encroaching beyond the maximum line which His Majesty’s Government had offered to King Abdul Aziz. 4 . I leave it to your discretion to make such use of this material as you consider appropriate in your reply to the Saudiy* Saudi Arabian Government’s representations, which may,subject to these suggestions, follow the line recommended in paragraph 6 of your despatch, I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State) l) LACY 1 :&gt; i ■ fpiTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia).

HAVING received your final instructions about the eastern frontier of Southern Arabia, conveyed in your telegrams Nos. 16 and 17 of the 27th January, I addressed a note to the Saudi Government on the 3rd February. A copy of this note is enclosed. On account of the pilgrimage, which is now at its height, a reply is not expected for a few days. • 2. In my telegram No. 36, dated the 31st January, I had the honour to inform you of Fuad Bey's obvious consternation on hearing the interpretation which His Majesty’s Government place upon the letter from Mr. Calvert of the 26th September, 1935. I transmit herewith a copy of a letter on this point which he has sent me, and a copy of my reply. Fuad Bey was, perhaps, disingenuous in quoting from the Arabic translation of Mr. Calvert’s letter, when he knows that the Arabic is only sent unofficially in order to assist the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Nevertheless the wording of the “ assurance ” was misleading, and unfortunately the Arabic is even more misleading, as the word “considerable,” which has no exact equivalent in common use in Arabic, was rendered, by the temporary translator who, in the absence of both the regular translators, had been borrowed from the Sudan, by the word “ adhim,” which means great. 3. If Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and Mr. Zada had kept as careful a record as was kept by the Foreign Office of a meeting with Mr. Rendel at the Foreign ^ ^ Office on the 27th November, 1935 (Foreign Office despatch No. 346. dated the 3rd December, 1935), any misunderstanding created by Mr. Calvert’s letter of the previous September would have been cleared up. The first part of the Foreign Office record reads as follows :— ■ K’* . &gt; “On the 27th November, the Saudi Minister, with whom I had been lunching, raised the question of the south-eastern Arabian frontiers with special reference to the Qatar Oil Concession. I found that Sheikh Hafiz had not clearly realised the position about the concession and I explained to him, with the aid of a map produced by Mr. Zada, that the concession was for a limited area which was described on a map attached to the concession, and that although, in one place, it extended slightly beyond the maximum frontier claimed by King Abdul Aziz, it did not, in fact, extend to what we regarded as the frontier between Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The limit of the concession in fact lay well to the north of the maximum line which we had been able to offer to King Abdul Aziz. There was no question of an unlimited blanket concession, as m the case of the Saudi concession to the Standard Oil Company of California, and in view of our known views on the frontier question there could be no question of the concession extending over territory the sovereignty over which was m any real doubt. “ Sheikh Hafiz did not dissent from this explanation and did not pursue the matter further.” I have, &amp;c.

Jedda, February 3, 1938. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge receipt of your Royal Highness’s letter dated the 19th December last regarding the boundary between the Saudi Arabian Kingdom and the territories of the Sheikhs of Qatar and Abu Dhabi. I did not fail to communicate to my Government the views expressed in that letter, as well as the substance of various conversations which I had with his Excellency Fuad Bey both before and after the date of the letter. In the course of the discussion to which your Royal Highness refers, which I had the pleasure to have with his Excellency on the 10th December, I learned that His Majesty’s Government had no cause to believe that the California Arabian Standard Oil Company would takQ action in the disputed area, and I conveyed this information to my Government, who were very glad to receive this assurance. My Government, however, much regret to learn from your Royal Highness’s above-mentioned letter that the Saudi Arabian Government attribute the failure to reach a settlement to His Majesty’s Government, As Mr. Rendel had the honour to point out to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz in person, my Government have repeatedly made concessions on this point, whereas the Saudi Arabian Government have been unwilling to abate their claim in the least. My Government are obliged to say, though with the most sincere regret, that they cannot see how it is possible for them to make any further concession in regard to a frontier which they adopted in accordance with history and the essential needs of the Arab States concerned. They feel that in bringing the frontier which they are prepared to accept so much nearer to the frontier proposed by the Saudi Arabian Government than they had originally considered possible they have shown a spirit of conciliation which they trust the Saudi Arabian Government have not overlooked. As to the proposed topographical mission, I did not fail to explain to my Government the opinion set forth in the last paragraph but one of your Royal Highness’s letter. My Government have considered that opinion with Ihe attention which they pay to every proposal made to them by the Saudi Arabian Government, but they do not find it possible to agree that the proposed mission would be pointless, since they believe that the claim of the Saudi Arabian Government is based in part upon incorrect topographical data. The sole object of the mission would be to establish certain facts, and my Government trust that the Saudi Arabian Government will find it possible to agree to its despatch. With highest respects, R.

Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Mecca, Dear Sir Reader, February 5, 1938. AS a result of your conversation with me last Sundav evening, the 30th January, regarding the correspondence going on about the abstention of the employees of the companies operating, whether in Saudi Arabia or in the Arab amirates, on the Persian Gulf from penetrating beyond the frontier to which my Government adhere, I looked up the correspondence exchanged between Mr. Calvert and my colleague, Yusuf Yasin, of the 26th September, 1935, and the 17th Jumadi-al-Thani (? Rajab), 1354, thinking that I might perhaps find in it what you mentioned to me in y r our conversation that evening concerning what your Government meant. I now feel it my duty to explain how my Govern ment understood the position, as is clear from 'the correspondence. Coi i espondence was exchanged between our two Governments regarding the concession granted by the Sheikh of Qatar to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, dated '.as your Mati dr Ant3 Wasl and Mr. Calvert wrote his personal letter to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, in which there occurs the following paragraph :— 0 t£ Tl 16 southern limit of the oil concession granted to the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company by the Sheikh of Qatar does not extend beyond this £ Green Line,’ but lies to a considerable distance to the north of it. The concession does not, therefore, extend to any territory under discussion with the Saudi Government.” ach a setty to i e «au(liitj| J Wiabi 1 J Sheikh Yusuf understood from this that, as the concession lay in an area ^ ia thatUvery far to the north of the Green Line, it was naturally outside the area under h his Em discussion, i.e., the area situated to the north and east of the G reen Line. Apart 16 courseo;ifrom that, the reply of Sheikh Yusuf to Mr. Calvert’s letter was decisive to any the pleajdoubt on the subject. If you will look again at the second and third paragraphs tHisHttOf that letter you will see clearly the fact to which Sheikh Yusuf adhered. In in Stand';! order to draw your attention (to it), I quote the following from the letter : — “ As regards your reference to (the fact) that the British Government, in accordance with their desire {sic) to deprive themselves of their strict legal rights, and offer a part of those rights to the Saudi Arab Govern ment, &amp;c.

I am glad to draw your attention in this respect to the true facts that our Government always desire that their relations with the Amirs of those territories (literally, directions) should be lasting relations of affection and friendship, and do'not desire to restrict (literally, press upon) them and their affairs, and they (Saudi Arabian Government) showed their readiness to grant them areas (territories) to the utmost extent which can be granted, on the under standing that the whole of those domains were previously subject to the fathers and forefathers of His Majesty the King Abdul Aziz. As regards the legal rights to which you refer and to which the British Government pretend, our Government cannot recognise and accept them and cannot consider them as basis for any discussion in connexion with those frontiers. In respect of the above, our Government therefore preserve their fullest rights in the territories and places which they cannot agree to renounce in favour of the Amirs of those territories, and (in regard to) all privileges or rights which may be granted at those reserved places, our Government cannot recognise or agree to them, and record their reservation in their regard. t£ This is on the one hand, and on the other I am pleased to inform you that our Government are fully prepared at any time to discuss the settle ment of the question of the frontiers in a spirit of affection and friendship to those neighbouring Amirs whenever discussion may be resumed on this subject ’’ 2 A 1 Saudi m The sole fiif (The English of this passage is taken from the translation which was sent to the Foreign Office in Jedda printed lettei Ko. 292 of the 16th October, 1935.)( 2 ) {pinM 1938. . gy eveif he abst# O’. jDlDg how nr ce. its rf; ID fill This letter was apparently effective in inducing the British Government to issue instructions to Mr. Calvert to address to Sheikh Yusuf \ asm anot ei . letter, dated the 26th October, in which he stated that Sir Andrew By an, who, as your Excellency is aware, is shortly arriving in Riyadh, will bring wit him new proposals in regard to the frontier question.

In the contrary case, they still insist on their opinion that there is nothing whatever to prevent them from authorising them to operate right up to the line by which they indicated their small claims from the Arab amirates. FUAD HAMZA. Enclosure 3. Si? 1 R. Bullard to Fuad Bey Hamza. My dear Fuad Bey, A ^ Jedda, February 9, 1938. IN replying to your letter of the 5th February I think it more useful to J confine myself to the meaning of the letter of Mr. Calvert of the 26th September,^ 1935, as I tried to do in our conversation of the 30th January^. I am sorry if the Saudi Arabian Government read the paragraph which you quote in a different sense from the sense in which it was intended by His Majesty’s Government. I notice that you quote the Arabic translation which was sent with Mr. Calvert’s letter. You are aware, however, that the official text of our communications to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs is the English, which is signed by the head of the post: the Arabic translation is sent for the convenience of the Ministry. The paragraph to which you refer reads thus :— Itv ■ first to kite ezsBinat uossitol it seeis The southern limit of the oil concession granted to the Anglo-Iranian I for ttiei Oil Company by the Sheikh of Qatar does not extend beyond this £ Green Line,’ but lies to a considerable distance to the north of it. The concession j ^ does not, therefore, extend to any territory under discussion with the Saudi Government .’ 5 (In the Arabic translation which accompanied this letter this passage was inserted in English.) This paragraph is composed of two sentences. The second is merely a corollary of the first, and was based on repeated assertions by His Majesty’s Government that they were not prepared to discuss any further abatement of their claims beyond the Green Line. It is true that His Majesty’s Government subsequently found themselves able to propose the line which was put forward by Sir Andrew Ryan at Riyadh, but that is beside the point for the moment. My »| point is that the paragraph quoted above expressed the position as it was on the 26th September, 1935, from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government. I hope that this paragraph is now quite clear. Yours sincerely, R. W.

These imp res si one of the Sheikh would undoubtedly get about in Abu Dhabi and the rest of the Arab coast, and would, of course, do us no good. 1^I have already reported (vide paragraph 9 of my Express Letter Ifo.C-71 of/,te: 2* stir of 16th FebTOary) that there are cl isouieting symptoms among the Trueial Coast Sheikhs and their people that they think the wishes of H*M«G. can he disregarded more or less with irrpunity* (c) paragraph 4 of the same telegram.

I think it extremely likely that in the event of a definite frontier being proposed as between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, the first question which the Sheikh would ask would be: w Till H.M.G. guarantee it as against the Saudi Government?” (d) paragraph 5 of the same telegram I think there are objections to the line running through Sufuk Wells which, to the best of my recollection, is admitted by the Saudi Government to belong to Abu Dhabi. £ K o« C c.(.

Sir, In connexion with the recent correspondence on the subject or the South Eastern boundaries of Saudi Arabia I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State zor Foreign Affairs, a copy of a note 1 by Sir Irenchard Eowle containing his replies to the questions addressed to him in the Secretary of State's telegram of the 18th — Atf March, No.561, (oi which a copy was sent to you on the 22nd March under cover of India Office letter No.P.Z. 1677/38) relative to the possible cession of the Khor al Odeid to Ibn Saud. In the light of this note, and of the views expressed in the 'Resident's telegram of the o* :6th February, and in the Government of India's telegram March (coni of the 8th Ivlafch (copies of which were sent to you respectively on the 28th February and 9th March, under cover of India Office letter numbered P.Z.1344/38 and 1600/38) the Marquess of Zetland is now able to express his considered opinion on the proposals whicn have been advanced for a settlement of the frontier separating Saudi Arabia from Qatar and the Trucial Sheikhs. 2. These proposals were put forward by your Department early in February as an outcome ou cTiti ciesii e of His Majesty's Government for the investigation of various proposals for securing the good will oi ming Saud. It was represented that one of the most important outstanding questions between His Majesty's Government Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.l. and/9 ||P and Saudi Arabia was that of the South Eastern Saudi frontier, anu that the removal of this source of friction would be a valuable contribution to the promotion of good will between Saudi Arabia and His Majesty 1 s Govermen in other matters. Agreement on the definition of the frontier has hitherto been found impossible by reason of the insistence of the Saudi Government on their claim to three localities which, named in descending order of the importance apparently attached to them by Ibn Saud, are the Jebel Hahsh, the Khor al Odeid and Sufuk. Since it is generally recognised that no compromise is possible in respect of the Jebel Hahsh attention was devoted to tne Khor al Odeid and to the possibility of reacning a satisfactory frontier settlement by the cession o:t this locality to Ibn Saud if the difficulties arising from the recognised rights of the Sheikh ox Abu Hnabi eoaiu. oe overcome. 3. Apart from the desirability of reaching a satisfactory settlement of the disputed fioubiei, LOx d Zetland fully recognises the importance o± retaining ano. promoting Ibn Sand's good will towards His Majesty's Government. But he shares the Government ox India's doubt whether the offer of the Khor al Oaeici, if it could be made, would be regarded by Ibn Saud as of sufficient value to affect materially the cordiality of His Majesty's Government's relations with Ibn Saud, whereas, on the other hand, an attempt to overcome the formidable difficulties in the way of arranging the cession might well involve a grave risk of prejudicing British influence among the protected Rulers of the Guix. It seems to him that nothing has happened in tne past* Suit' o. year to invalidate the vie// expressed by His Majesty’ * ^ 3' f3t» ||p, | ^ Minister at Jedda in his despatch Ho.47 of the 27th March 1937 wherein he said that even if it were possible to induce the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi to give up the IChor al Odeid to Ibn Saud he ’’doubted whether the transfer would be worth the making since it would not give Ibn Saud the port he needs and we should have made a political sacrifice without gaining the advantage which I think we should stand to gain from any improvement in Ibn Sand’s economic position”. 4. With regard to the feasibility of arranging the cession of the IQior al Odeid it is accepted that the cession could not be effected without the ^consent oi the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, whose ownership has been acknowledged by a series of decisions by Government culminating in the guarantee given to the Sheikh in 1906. Lord wetland would be firmly opposed to any suggestion that pressuie should be exerted on the Sheikh to secure his consent to the cession. In the Secretary of State’s view any question of a cession would necessarily have to depend on the Sheikh’s voluntary consent, and whether this would be forthcoming would obviously depend on the advanuages which he would expect to derive therefrom. M^oUcioal *•*,*.. V J Resident has pointed out in his telegram oj. one &lt;ouuh February that there is no imminent menace oi bauai or f * Wahabi exp an si' o n 'vr .hi oh t he Sheikh would wish to arrest at the cost of surrendering part of his territory, and m his view it would he necessary for His Majesty's Government to satisfy the Sheikh withjnonetary compensation if his consent is to he obtained. Sir Trenchard Fowls finds it impossible to hazard any guess as to the amount of such c o mp e n s at i o n/ * ■ V'*!|ip compensation that the Sheikh would be likely to accept. In his opinion it would have to be settled by a process of bargaining, and he can only suggest, in the light of the Sheikh 1 s dealings witil Petroleum Concessions Limited, that his figure woulo.. be likely to be high. But, even if His Majesty’s Government were prepared to make funds available for this purpose, any attempt to purchase the Sheikh’s consent is bound, in Lord Zetland’s view, to have very unfavourable reactions on British prestige among the Arab Sheikhs of the Gulf. 5. There is also the further difficulty that the Sheikh might not unreasonably expect any frontier settlement achieved in return for a territorial sacrifice on his part to be accompanied by an assurance that the frontier would be respected, and might accordingly demand iiiartM «****. .'VrYfC*** sa.-«* v /^.%hxwwvv«wi«viCW« » 00 &lt;*&gt;^Ma« 3 WWCV/. a guarantee of protection on the landward sine of his territory. His Majesty’s Government would oi couise be able to promise the Sheikh diplomatic intervenoion in the event of violation of his territory, buo io is not yot clear that he could be promised the moi e practical assistance which he might consider indispensable for the defence of his frontier. 6. Apart from the practical difficulties indicated above Lord Zetland feels that the suggested compromise is open to several other serious objections. In the Government of India’s view the traditional objecoions xo admitting Saudi influence to the Trucial Coast and to allowing the chain of protected States oo be broken are still of considerable weight. The strategical importance of the air route along the Arab coast of tne Gulf certainly i ^ a nr\ 4*'hq+* there shoula be no weskenin^, o«l seems to demand cnau British/8 ./ 5. British influence among the local Sheikhs. In Lord Zetland’s view the cession of territory on the Trucial Coast to Ion Sana ~ territory to which, it must 'be emphasised, he has no historical claim - would not fail to enhance his prestige, at the expense of that of His Majesty’s Government, among the Trucial Sheikhs, quite apart from the permanent opportunity it would give for the active extension of Saudi influence among them. Moreover, as the Resident and the Government of India have pointed out, even if the Sheikh’s consent were refused, the attempt to secure it, pai'ticularly id accompanied bj/ some fiiicinwial inducement, might easily create the impression that His Majesty’s Government were anxious through ieai of x on Saud to yield to his demanus. Such an impression would he specially unfortunate at the present time when the Sheikhs are in a difficult mood and show signs of thinking that His Majesty’s Government’s wishes can he disregarded with impunity. 7.

Your Royal Highness, After Compliments, I have the honour to inform Your Royal Highness that I transmitted to my Government the unnumbered letter rrom the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dated January 10th 1938&gt; regarding the activities of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company in the neighbour hood of the Qatar frontier, and that I have now received their observations on this point, which are as follows. beginning its operations in Hasa, the Government of the United States of America asked His Majesty's Government for information about the boundaries in those parts. His Majesty's Government furnished the required information, and in particular, care was taken to explain, for the information of the oil company, that the legal frontier of Saudi Arabia in that area was the 'blue line.' The fact that this communication had been made to the United States Government was duly conveyed to the Saudi Arabian Government in Sir Andrew Ryan's letter No. 65 of April 28th 1934* Since that time His Majesty's Government have not informed either the United States Governmenc or the Saudi Arabian Government that they no longer regard the 'blue line' as the legal frontier or that they consider the oil company free to operate to the east of that line. His Majesty's Government feel that they would have been justified in protesting to trie Saudi Arabian Government when they learned that the oil company, in spite of the above-mentioned letter to the Saudi Government, were In 1934&gt; when the said oil company was operating/ His Royal Highness The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mecca.2 operating in the neighbourhood of Qasr al Salwa. On the contrary, out of deference to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, and in their desire to do all they could to facilitate matters for him and for the company operating in his territory, they confined their action to informing representatives of the company, quite informally, that notwithstanding their previous communications to the United States and Saudi Arabian G-overnments, they would raise no objection to the company’s operating to the east of the line which His Majesty’s Government still regarded as the legal eastern frontier of Saudi Arabian territory, on the understanding that the company would not encroach on territory to the east of the extreme limit proposed by His Majesty’s .t Government to the Saudi Government. The action of His Majesty’s Government and of this Legation in conveying the information in question to representatives of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company was in accordance with the practice in cases where important oil companies, whether of the same or of different nationalities, are operating in adjoining areas, and His Majesty’s Government regret that the Saudi Government should take exception to what is a normal procedure intended to ensure the maintenance of good relations between the great oil companies and also between the countries in which they are registered.

A copy has been sent to by ^ Mail.(E 2579/1 - '■ foreign office, S.w.l. 1st j'uly, 1938. I am directed by Viscount Halifax tt request you to inform the Marquess of Zetland that he has carefully considered your letter P.Z.2887/38 of 3rd May, respecting the possibility of ceding to Ibn Saud, in order thereby to secure an agreed frontier between the Trucial Sheikhdoms and Saudi Arabia, certain territory adjoining the Khor-el-Odeid which at present belongs to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi# 2. Lord Halifax fully realizes that the grant to Ibn Saud of access to the Khor-el-Odeid could not be guaranteed to have a lasting good effect upen his relations with His Majesty’s Government. It is unhappily only too likely that the necessity placed upon His Majesty’s Government of following a certain policy ip regard to Palestine may make it impossible for Ibn Saud not to work against them in certain circumstances, whether he receives satisfaction over his south-eastern frontiers or not* He has never made any attempt to conceal this possibility and the prospect of having it forced upon him has been cne of the principal motives behind his constant appeals to His Majesty's Government to reconsider their policy. 3./ hder-Secretary of State, India Office#3 , But although it cannot he guaranteed that any concession which might he made over the Khor-el-Odeid would have a permanent effect in securing Ihn Baud’s friendship, there are strong arguments, in Lord Halifax's opinion, for making every endeavour to reach a final settlement of this frontier question at the present time* His Lordship would in fact see great advantage in such a settlement even from the point of view of delations with Saudi Arabia* In His Lordship’s opinion the position is different from what it was when Sir Reader Bullard expressed his doubts a year ago as to the advantages to he obtained from letting Ibn Saud have access to the Khor-el-Odeid, because His Majesty's Government have since then, and at a time when the general international outlook has become increasingly threatening, adopted the policy of setting up a Jewish State in a part of Palestine. The change which this has brought into the Middle Eastern situation is fundamental and His Majesty s Governmen must clearly do everything within their power at this present juncture to retain the good-will of Ihn Saud and - more important still - to strengthen his hand in dealing with his own people. A frontier settlement which would give him access to the sea at a new point on the Persian Gulf and could he represented as a success for his diplomacy would Tn anv c ase the dangers of the help in both these directions. In a y ., . course of action which may present time are so great that no course promote these objects can safely he overlooked. 4. It will be seen from what has been said 1. Lord HoUf..'. opinion . concision r, e .r01n e IM S.od'.claim to the Khor-el-Odeid might with advantage he made even at the risk of considerable inconvenience in other directions, as for example some diminution in the prestige of His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf, although he is naturally desirous that no avoidable action should be taken which might have this result* But for the reasons given below he is not convinced that the action which has been proposed for the settlement of the south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia need in fact have a serious adverse effect on British prestige locally* 5* The position, as His Lordship sees it, is as 1 •- ' — !■ — - — ' follows. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi controls a territory V, extending inland from the coast for an indefinite distance. In theory this territory may be regarded as having in the recent past extended, or at any rate as having been capable of extension, as far west as the Blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914 and as far south as the boundary, wherever that may be, dividing the territory of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman (whose territory has likewise been theoretically capable of extension to the. Blue line) from the territories of the Trucial Sheikhs* In practice, however, the Sheikh has been unable to assert his authority over so wide an area and His Majesty’s Government have been obliged to recognise that at the utmost he has not asserted it further west or south than the so-called Riyadh line offered to Ibn Saud in 1955. The Power to whom the Sheikh has lost what may be called his/area between the Blue (Rl) his reversionary rights to the line and the Riyadh line is unquestionably Ibn Saud, and he has lost them, not through any sudden act of conquest or intrusion, but as the result of a gradual forward movement which had probably begun long before the Blue as a natural frontier to the west and north of which the authority of the Sheikh was firmly established, there might be no need to apprehend a further Saudi advance* But it is nothing of the kind. Apart from the probability that Ibn Saud is already the over-lord of the inhabitants of the area lying between it and the Khojr-el- Odeid, the recent enquiries into the possibility of providing landing grounds in the hinterland of the Trucial coast for use by aircraft engaged on survey work do not suggest that the control of any of the Trucial Sheikhs over the interior is really effective, while it is known that Saudi officials have been able in recent years to penetrate as far east as Baraimi# Even, therefore, if there is no imminent menace of Saudi or Wahabi expansion upon the Trucial coast itself, it equally does not appear that further expansion towards that coast would meet with any obstacle* line came into being* 6. If it were possible to regard the Riyadh line 7. It is, in fact, the nature of t bis expansion which lies at the root of the problem. Ibn. Saud f s advance has proceeded quietly but inexorably* ? or no ap-i »ar-ent/apparent reason except that there has been nothing to stop it. It i~ reasonable to suppose that for a ruler of Ibn Saud f s prestige it is easy to persuade desert tribes who are not under the control of any recognised ruler to say that they ow r e allegiance to himself, and unless some effective checK to this natural and even inevitable process can be devised, it is likely to^ continue through the years until Ibn Baud’s authority extends to the very outskirts of the Trucial I Kfe —' 1 ~ ‘ ■ ——■—•&gt; ports. There are only two ways, so far as Lord Halifax can see, of preventing this. The one is for His Majesty’s Government to lay dovm a frontier unilaterally and declare their intention of maintaining it by force of artnSc The other is to agree with Ibn Baud upon a frontier which he will formally and openly recognise, and which he and his successors will thereafter be unable to disregard without providing His Majesty’s Government with grounds for opposing them with a degree of vigour which could not be justified in the present anomalous situation* 8&lt;&gt; There can be no question but that the se con d of these alternatives is much to be preferred, if it can be achieved. It cannot, however, be achieved without ^ the cession to Ibn Baud of either the Jebel Naksh, which is ' * impossible, or the Khor-el-Odeid, which is only possible with the acquiescence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi* The position of the Sheikh being what it is, he would have every reason to welcome the establishment of a settled frontier, more or less following the Riyadh line, in return for/for the surrender of a small area of empty desert adjacent to the Khcr-el-Odeld for which he can have little or no use, hut which may have great value for Ihn Saud, both sentimentally and as a possible corridor for an oil pipe-line to the Persian G-ulf 0 9o Whether the Sheikh can he persuaded to see his own interests in this light is, however, a separate problem, and on the assumption (which has yet to he proved) that he will refuse to do so, two main ways of compensating him still further for the loss of some of his territory have been considered^ The first of these is a money payment and the second is an assurance of supoort in the event of a serious attack from the landward sideo 10o Lord Halifax shares to the full the distaste which has been expressed for a money payment, because it clearly imports a questionable element into a settlement which can be justified on its own merits and which the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi ought to accept in his own interests® Nevertheless, if a money payment would secure the Sheikh's acquiescence in a frontier settlement, His Majesty’s Government ought not, in His Lordship's opinion, to hesitate to pay any reasonable sum which might be necessary He notes that it is impossible for the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to hazard a guess as to the sum which the Sheikh would-regard as adequate compensation, but looking at the question from another angle — that is to say from the point of view of the value of a settlement to HisMajesty's Government - he considers that £25,000 or even a larger sum would not be too much, 11c The alternative, or additional, form of compensation is an undertaking to protect the Sheikh in the event of a land attack from Saudi Arabia. Lord Halifax notes that in the opinion of the Political Resident the first question which the Sheikh would be likely to ask if approached regarding the Khor-el-Odeid would be: 'Will His Majesty’s Government guarantee this u frontier as against Saudi Arabia?” His Lordship considers that if it were necessary to secure the Sheikh's concurrence, an endeavour should be made to meet to some extent his wishes on this point. The precise wording of any assurance given to the Sheikh would need consider* ation. It would clearly be undesirable that His Majesty's Government should undertake any responsibility for intervening if some tribal elements on the Abu Dhabi side of the frontier chose to repudiate the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and to declare allegiance to Ibn Saud; nor could His Majesty’s Government accept responsibility for the prevention of tribal raids from Saudi Arabian territory across the frontier. The undertakings to be assumed by His Majesty’s Government should be so worded as to apply only in the event of major aggression against Abu Dhabi on the part of the territorial sovereign on the other side of the frontier. 12. Lord Halifax is aware that assurances of this kind may seem to constitute an extension of the responsibilities/responsibilities of His Majesty's Government. He realises that in particular strong objection is seen in many quarters to increasing the commitments of His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf by adding to the existing obligations to defend the Trucial Sheikhs from aggression by sea an obligation to defend any one of them from aggression by land, and that the view has been expressed that if His Majesty's Government were to undertake such an adcfiitional commitment it might necessitate an adjustment in the forces of His Majesty’s Government in the neighbourhood of the Gulf. His Lordship cannot help feeling, however, that these responsibilities already exist and the additional obligation would be more apparent than real* 15* In the first place, the fact that the air route along the Trucial coast is a vital sector in the communications of the Empire means that His Majesty's Government could not in practice allow any Power not under their influence to occupy any part of the coast or its immediate vicinity which was of importance for the air route* The only uncertainty is at what point His Majesty’s Government are to consider that their position on the Trucial coast would be threatened* At present they emu f; j G 3 so far as their formal obligations to the Sheikhs are concerned, to allow the predominant Power in the adjacent parts of Arabia to extend its influence as far as the Trucia}. ports themselves* It is doubtful, however, whether His Majesty’s Government could even now remain inactive/I inactive while the authority of one of the Trucial Sheikhs was irreparably undermined in this way, while in the event of a serious attack from Saudi Arabia His Majesty’s Government would in practice find themselves obliged to intervene to prevent the Sheikh from being overwhelmed* 14. In the second place, if any oil company hereafter wishes as the result of a survey to undertake active operations in the interior, it will not be able to do so unless it knows that the site of these operations lies to the north and east of a settled frontier, and once such operations had begun His Majesty’s Government would inevitably be obliged to interest themselves in the maintenance of that frontier. 15. Nevertheless, Lord Halifax is prepared to agree that every effort should be made to avoid the additional commitment involved in a definite guarantee of any landward frontier which might eventually he fixed for the Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi as the outcane of the present discussion and that the support of His Majesty s Government should be limited to a promise to intervene energetically with Ibn Saud or his successors in the event of their disregarding the new frontier. 16. In the circumstances set forth above&gt; Lord Halifax considers that His Majesty's Government should endeavour to grasp an opportunity which may not recur of settling this most difficult of frontier questions and should to that end try to persuade the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi to par£ with the relatively small area . I . , 1 % necessary/necessary to give Ibn Saud access to the Khor-el-©Se&amp;3 if possible in return for a settled frontier, hut if necessary with the added inducements of a promise of general good offices in matters relating to that frontier and a money payment. But the question still remains of what attitude His Majesty T s Government should adopt if all these inducements fail in their object. Lord Halifax would not for a moment dispute the view that it would be wrong to bring pressure to bear upon any Trucial Sheikh to act to his own disadvantage, merely in order to further the interests of His Majesty's Government, But in this case the action proposed is manifestly not to the Sheikh’s disadvantage. Moreover His Majesty’s Government are surely entitled to take into account the fact that without their protection not one of the Trucial Sheikhs could last for a day against Ibn Saud and to expect from these Sheikhs a greater degree of co-operation in matters affecting the interests of His Majesty's Government than many of them have seemed disposed to show in recent yearso 17. This being so, Lord Halifax feels that in the event of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi proving obdurate he should be informed that this is a case in which His Majesty's Government must insist, in the interests of his people and successors, on his following their advice in return for which they will promise to take up on his behalf all matters affecting his landward frontiers andV 19./ Jflt the discretion, of the Political Resident) a money payment, which, might be disguised as compensation for the loss of imaginary dues or revenues from the ceded territory. 18. The question of the effect which such an attitude might have upon the prestige of His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf is one upon which Lord Halifax naturally expresses an opinion with diffidence. But he suggests that provided no injustice is done a show of firmness in such a situation ought not to diminish the prestige of His Majesty's Government, but rather to enhance it. It may be argued that this might be so, but for the fact that to the Trucial Sheikhs it would appear that His Majesty’s Government were being firm with one of themselves because they dared not be firm with Ibn Saud. Lord Halifax recognises the force of this argument, but he sees no reason why the advantages to the Sheikhs of a settled frontier should not be understood locally. It might indeed be represented to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi that Ibn Saud is the friend of the British and has throughout his career (unlike certain lesser Arab rulers of no importance who are ignorant of world affairs) shown himself consistently well-disposed to His Majesty s Government and anxious in all circumstances to consult their interests; so that His Majesty’s Government, for their part, have no hesitation in asking the Sheikh to contribute his share towards an agreement which is considered to be advantageous to all parties.19* Thei»e remains to be considered the opinion expressed by the Government of India that there are political objections to making a breach in the line of territory under British control at present stretching along the coast of the Persian Gulf from Qatar to Muscat or to admit further Saudi access to the Gulfi The Service Departments are understood to be satisfied that there are no strategical disadvantages to be apprehended from Saudi access to the Khoir-el-Odeid, and it seems clear that such access will not give Ibh Saud any greater opportunities for expanding his influence upon the Truciel Coast than he already possesses at the present time* On the contrary, a settled frontier between his territories and those of the Trucial Sheikhs would set definite limits to such expansion. Lord Halifax finds it difficult in these circumstances to form a clear idea of the nature of the political objections, and in any case these objections do not in his opinion outweigh the wider political advantages of securing a frontier settlement with Ibn Saud* * 2 #* CepSes of this letter are being sent to the departments represented on the Middle Eastern Sub committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence and te the Petroleum Department I am.

I HAVE the honour to tralismit herewith, in translation, a note from the Saudi Government, dated the 26th June, about the eastern frontier. It is a reply to the note, a copy of which was sent to the Foreign Office with my printed despatch No. 72, dated the 14th April, in which the right of His Majesty’s Government to keep the American oil company concerned informed of the frontier situation was reiterated, and it deals also in principle with the question of prospecting for oil in the disputed zone. It will be seen that the Saudi Govern ment do no more than repeat their offer to refrain from prospecting in the disputed zone until a frontier agreement is arrived at, provided that His Majesty's Govern ment will ensure that a similar policy of abstention is observed from the Qatar side. 2. In my telegram No. 56 dated the 7th March, I reported Fuad Bey’s “ personal ” opinion as to the sort of solution that might be acceptable to his Government. Fuad Bey went to Syria on leave soon after that, and had I been in a position to give him my views on his opinion, the reply was to be sent to him there. It is possible that the Saudi Arabian Government have been waiting for such a reply, but their reference to Fuad Bey may have resulted from their con sciousness that he is the only person in their employ who thoroughly understands the bilingual correspondence on this subject and can be trusted to write a clear reply. *3. The deadlock is still complete. The only hopeful feature in the situation is that the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company are more and more inclined to believe that the oil-field in Hasa is extremely rich. If this belief is well-founded, Ibn Saud’s bitterness on the frontier question, in so far as it has an economic basis, should diminish with time, though an increase in his income will not make him less touchy on the point of prestige. / /; ~ ^ c ^ 4. On looking through the file, I see that, owing to a regrettable oversight, the Saudi note which I summarised briefly in my telegram No. 40 of the 23rd Feb ruary was never sent to you. A translation is enclosed. 1 expect to proceed to England on leave in a few days, and this question can perhaps be considered once more while I am at home, though I have no useful suggestions to make. All we can do, it seems, is to revert to our proposal for a preliminary examination of the area in dispute, which is little more than a device by which we hope to convince the Saudi authorities that Jabal Nakhsh is an integral part of the small Jabal Dukhan range. If the invitation which I have received holds good and I spend a few weeks at Ibn Saud’s camp in Nejd next spring, it might perhaps be possible to organise a visit to the Qatar boundary for this purpose. 5 I am sending copies of this despatch, with copies of enclosures, to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire and the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department at Simla. 4r 'y 'npr*-— / -.,-.-1 :—pm •'Saudi I have, &amp;c. fii.utU-s R.

The Government of the Saudi Arabian Kingdom have already informed the British Government of their non-recognition of the Blue Line, and that they did not consider it(’s existence) as a proper reason for the surrender of territories and places which are under their control, and in their possession from ancient and in recent times. 2. Our Government do not recognise the validity of any orders which any Government may give to individuals or companies in their country. It is the right of our Government and no one else to give such information. 3. His Majesty the King always desires—it is his habit—not to create any difficulty for his neighbours, and particularly for the British Government. He therefore hopes that the frontier question may be settled at their earliest convenience. 4. With a view to the obviation of disputes at the present time until after the conclusion of a definite agreement with Qatar in respect of the delimitation of the frontiers, he is prepared to give special orders to the California-Arabian Standard Oil Company to the effect that they must not cross the maximum limit of the frontiers as proposed by the British Government, provided that Qatar undertakes to prevent the oil company in their territory from crossing the maximum limit, as requested by our Government, until after the conclusion of a definite agreement in respect of the frontiers. If the British Government agree to this (solution) our Government is prepared to accept it. k 0 ^. With highest res^pects^ ^ . U .1/ inister for Foreign A if airs. s ‘/ i &amp; Ufy Enclosure 2. » |\ Saudi Government to Sir R. Bullard. (Translation.) Your Excellency, MeccayFebruary I HAVE received your Excellency’s letter, dated the 3rd February, regarding the south-eastern frontiers. The Government of His Majesty desire nothing better than to be in agreement with the British Government on every subject of common interest and to have a complete understanding on all matters. They have already exerted and are still exerting their endeavours, as the British Government are aware, to settle every question in a manner satisfactory to both parties and calculated to secure their common interests. One of the points on which they have spent their efforts in order to bring the two parties nearer to each other is the settlement of the question of the south-eastern frontiers between Saudi Arabia and the Arab amirates on the Persian Gulf in a manner satisfactory to all and calculated to secure the lawful interest of both parties. You state that your Government have shown a spirit of great conciliation in the matter of the frontier to which my Government hold, whereas the position to which my Government hold has remained unchanged. It is true that that is the apparent position, but if you will examine the spirit of conciliation actually shown by my Government, it will prove to you that they have gone very far indeed towards meeting the wishes of their friends the British Government, When the question of this frontier was first raised in London and Jedda, the position of my Government was clear, viz., that what they hold to is all the territories which belonged to the fathers and grandfathers of His Majesty the King; and these, of course, include much wider areas than the frontier to which their claims were subsequently limited. As you are aware, the agreement of 1915 plainly recognises as belonging to His Majesty the King what belonged to his fathers and grandfathers. A satisfactory adhesion to the text of that agree ment would make a large part of the Hadhramaut, Dhufar, Oman, Abu Dhabi and Qatar fall within the territories of His Majesty the King, and an historical examination (of the facts) shows that the posts at Abr and Bairami and Dhifar and in the middle of Qatran were Saudi posts founded by the forefathers of His Majesty the King in the last century. Nevertheless, His Majestv the King, (was)—~nin iHTianfc. H f / 3 desirous that there should be agreement and understanding with the British (jovernment, and that his friends among the Arab rulers on the Persian Gulf S a 11 iT- n °^ ^ e P r ^ ve( ^’ even though that should involve himself in material loss. All this caused him, after strong insistence, to limit his claims to the minimum, hoping (thereby) to put a decisive end to the difficulties. It never entered into His Majesty s thoughts that what he mentioned would be a subject of argument and dispute. The line to which my Government holds represents the minimum of their legitimate and reasonable claims; consequently, your Excellency’s statement that the conciliation and concession have come from the British Government, while the position of my Government has not changed, indicates disdain for the Govern ment of His Majesty and forgetfulness of the great sacrifices which they have made in renouncing in favour of the rulers of those neighbouring Arab territories wide areas whose ownership by His Majesty can be proved by every historical and actual right. It never entered into the thoughts of my Government to bargain about the frontier which they put forward, for it was drawn after deep reflection and careful consideration; and it was on account of the insistence of the British Government that it was drawn so as to cover the very minimum of the just claims. Had my Government thought that it would be the subject of discussion and bargaining, they would have taken up a different position, whereas they limited their claims to the minimum, hoping that the British Government would not argue about it, but would accept it as a just and practical frontier in the interests of both parties. I do not conceal from your Excellency that my Government attaches the greatest importance to this frontier and regards it is a very vital matter. Nay, more : I can say that this question is a question of life and death in con nexion with that part of His Majesty’s dominions. They, therefore, regret exceedingly that the British Government do not appreciate their position at its true value; at the same time, however, they express their readiness to discuss any practical proposal which will secure the interests of both parties and obviate harm. ^ fi 4 As to the abstention by employees of the companies on both sides from encroaching on the disputed areas, the Deputy Foreign Minister in his personal letter of 3/12/1356 (the 3rd February, 1938) explained the essence of the position to your Excellency as my Government understand it, and in it he explained exactly how the matter stood. I hope that there may be sufficient explanation therein to help to clear up the present misunderstanding and to bring about a fundamental solution of the difficulties. As to the question of the appointment of a topographical commission, His Majesty’s Government, before giving a definite reply to the request, would like to enquire from your Government as to the areas required to be surveyed in order that the matter may be sufficiently clear to both sides, and that the confusion which might result if the agreement were general and not precise may be avoided. I await, therefore, the opinion of your Government on the three points set forth above. Co/La-j sju^X kr P.L. aUf-s d. U.rn SI) i.Cr FEYSAL.4963 2000 7.36 By Air Mail.

It is our understanding that Ibn Saud refuses to accept the 1913/14 JI Blue Line” as being the south-eastern frontier of his dominions, and that he has refused to accept a number of alternative lines suggested by H.M.G. at various times. Although, however, no frontier has been yet agreed and Ibn Saud still claims territory east of the most easterly line so far suggested by H.M.G., nevertheless (as we understand) H.M.G. have requested Ibn Saud to restrain the Standard Oil Company of California from carrying out prospecting east of H.M.G.’s last proposed line, and have also requested the California Company itself in the same sense. You were kind enough to indicate to me on the map this line, which is H.M.G. 1 s latest offer and California's interim prospecting frontier. As this line presumably represents, in the judgment of H.M.G., the limits of Ibn Baud's justifiable claims to territory, it is assumed that all territorjr eastward thereof may be taken as lying neither within his dominions, nor ( as an obvious consequence) within the California Concession of 1933 I write now to ask you very kindly to confirm this view, with ^•1.Gibson, Bsq., India Office, Wh i t eh all, S .W. 1. it;fS 4 ius corollary that l.C.L* may carry out prospecting over 061 ri fcor;7 easi: 01 t]iat line, subject to having obtained necessary rights from the Rulers.

As you are aware, His Majesty’s Government have taken steps to restrain the California Arabian Standard Oil Company from operating in territory south of Qatar lying east of the line which His Majesty’s Government have most recently proposed to recognise as the boundary of Saudi Arabia. As a necessary consequence they are obliged, pending a settlement of the disputed frontier, to refuse assent to the extension of operations by any Company from areas under their influence beyond the frontier line claimed by Ibn Saud. This of course has no reference to the territory covered by the Qatar Oil concession.

This is true in itself tout almost entirely on account of oil possibilities in that area* If we were sure tnat there was no oil tnere t tnen Ibn »&amp; * ud* s penetration to places like Haraimi might be a nuisance but certainly would not have the importance it does at present provided he was kept at a reas onable distance iTQw/from tne Coast for tfl# frontier to be of any use to us it seems to me tnat xt must definitely be guaranteed in tne same way tnat tne Kuw&amp;it'»tt&amp;u 4 i or ^atar-t 4 audi boundaries are guaranteed, Tnat is to say tne Shaikhs of both tneae territories have been guaranteed by His Majesty’s Government protection from agression across tneir frontiers, This howewwr tne foreign Office are not prepared to give without qualification, it Is true that tney are willing to give tne same sort of guarantee to abu )nabi as His Majesty^ Government have given to Kuwait and qatar (vide last sentence of tneir paragraph 11 ), but earlier in the sat® paragraph tney say that w it would clearly be undesirable tnat His Majesty’s Government should undertake any responsibility for intervening if some tribal elements on tne &gt;*ou 3 imbi side of tne frontier cnose to repudiate tne anaiicn of Abu Dhabi and to declare allegiance to ibn i&gt;a*ud H , This is exactly the sort of tactics that J-bn t&gt;a*ud would adopt for ’’peaceful penetration” of tne frucial Coast Hinterland and it would jekmacfcp have to be made clear to ibn 6 a* ud that any shifting of tribal allegiance would its no^w ay give the &amp;&amp;udi Government any right whatever beyond tne frontier fixed. 4* The; Foreign Office argue (their paragraphs 12 and 13) (a) that since in any case we have to guard the air route along the Truci&amp;l Coast the guarantee of Saudi tne Abu Dhabi/frontier would hardly be an additional commitment. Further (b) tnat if oil is found (tneir paragraph 14) in t neninterlana His Majesty’s Government would/would inevitably be obliged to interest tnemselves in t ne maintenance ot tnat frontier, witn regard to (a) f for tne security of tnis route we would only hare to keep Ibn 3a* dd at a certain distance from the Coast but not necessarily from penetrating the hinterland at a considerable distance from it. fith regard to (b) this argument certainly applies xancbgK if oil is found, but not otherwise. o. the Foreign Office suggest (paragraph 10 of t neir letter) that tne sum of £ 2 b f 000 /-$ or even more, might be paid to the shaikh of Abu 3nabi for the surrender of nnor-el-Odeid. In paragraph 5 of ^ ^my telegram No.T/4tt, dated 2btn February 1036, 1 gave my view that it w&amp;e impossible to compete wnat sum the 6 naikn would be likely to accept, and whether £ 26,000/- is adequate or not 1 really cannot say.

I also gave some further views in ray note of 16th April 1036 to Hr. Cribs on. 9 * 6 . In paragraph 17 of tneir letter tne Foreign Office suggest that in case tne Ohaikn of Abu Dhabi proves obdurate in refusing to sell his territory His Majesty* a government must insist on his following their advice. Tne Foreign Office grounds for tnis proposed action are tnat wniie *it would be wrong to bring pressure to bear on any Truclai ahalkh to act4 1 to hia own disadvantage, in this ease, as tne sale ol nis territory would beto his advaiitage, there! ore objections to the voluntary sale of a piece of his territory by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, tnere are obvious** -ly far stronger objections to a forced sale, and sucn a step would have a deplorable effect cotn locally and in the neighbouring countries of baud!

[E 2579/150/91] Copy No. Foreign Office to India Office. ^ _ Foreign Office, July 1, 1938. v ^ j tl c ^ irec ^ e( ^ V iscount Halifax to request you to inform the Marquess of Zetland that he has carefully considered your letter of the 3rd May respecting the possibility of ceding to Ibn Saud, in order thereby to secure an agreed frontier between the 1 racial bheikhdoms and Saudi Arabia, certain territory adjoining the Khor-el-Odeid, which at present belongs to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. 2. Lord Halifax fully realises that the grant to Ibn Saud of access to the Khor-el-Odeid could not be guaranteed to have a lasting good effect upon his relations with His Majesty’s Government. It is, unhappily, only too likely that the necessity placed upon His Majesty’s Government of following a certain policy in regard to Palestine may make it impossible for Ibn Saud not to work against them in certain circumstances, whether he receives satisfaction over his south eastern frontiers or not. He has never made any attempt to conceal this possibility and the prospect of having it forced upon him has been one of the principal motives behind his constant appeals to His Majesty’s Government to reconsider their policy. 3. But although it cannot be guaranteed that any concession which might be made over the Khor-el-Odeid would have a permanent effect in securing Ibn Baud’s friendship, there are strong arguments, in Lord Halifax’s opinion, for making every endeavour to reach a final settlement of this frontier question at the present time. His Lordship would, in fact, see great advantage in such a settle ment, even from the point of view of relations with Saudi Arabia. In his Lordship’s opinion, the position is different from what it was when Sir Reader Bullard expressed his doubts a year ago as to the advantages to be obtained from letting Ibn Saud have access to the Khor-el-Odeid, because His Majesty’s Govern ment have since then, and at a time when the general international outlook has become increasingly threatening, adopted the policy of setting up a Jewish State in a part of Palestine. The change which this has brought into the Middle Eastern situation is fundamental, and His Majesty’s Government must clearly do everything within their power at this present juncture to retain the goodwill of Ibn Saud and—more important still—to strengthen his hand in dealing with his own people. A frontier settlement which would give him access to the sea at a new point on the Persian Gulf and could be represented as a success for his diplomacy would help in both these directions. In any case the dangers of the present time are so great that no course of action which may promote these objects can safely be overlooked. 4. It will be seen from what has been said above that, in Lord Halifax’s opinion, a concession regarding Ibn Sand’s claim to the Khor-el-Odeid might with advantage be made even at the risk of considerable inconvenience in other directions, as, for example, some diminution in the prestige of His Majesty s Government in the Persian Gulf, although he is naturally desirous that no avoid able action should be taken which might have this result. But for the reasons given below he is not convinced that the action which has been proposed for the settlement of the south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia need, in fact, have a serious adverse effect on British prestige locally. 5. The position, as his Lordship sees it, is as follows : The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi controls a territory extending inland from the coast foi an indefinite distance. In theory, this territory may be regarded as haying in the lecent past extended, or at any rate as having been capable of extension, as fai west as the blue line' of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914 and as far south as the boundary, wherever that may be, dividing the tenitory of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman (whose territory has likewise been theoretically capable of extension to [355 a—1]the blue line) from the territories of the Trucial sheikhs. In practice, however, the sheikh has been unable to assert his authority over so wide an area, and His Majesty’s Government have been obliged to recognise that at the utmost he has not asserted it further west or south than the so-called Riyadh line offered to Ibn Saud in 1935. The Power to whom the sheikh has lost what may be called his reversionary rights to the area between the blue line and the Riyadh line is unquestionably Ibn Saud, and he has lost them, not through any sudden act of conquest or intrusion, but as the result of a gradual forward movement which had probably begun long before the blue line came into being. 6. If it were possible to regard the Riyadh line as a natural frontier to the west and north of which the authority of the sheikh was firmly established, there might be no need to apprehend a further Saudi advance. But it is nothing of the kind. Apart from the probability that Ibn Saud is already the overlord of the inhabitants of the area lying between it and the Khor-el-Odeid, the recent enquiries into the possibility of providing landing-grounds in the hinterland of the Trucial Coast for use by aircraft engaged on survey work do not suggest that the control of any of the Trucial sheikhs over the interior is really effective, while it is known that Saudi officials have been able in recent years to penetrate as far east as Baraimi. Even, therefore, if there is no imminent menace of Saudi or Wahabi expansion upon the Trucial Coast itself, it equally does not appear that further expansion towards that coast would meet with any obstacle. 7. It is, in fact, the nature of this expansion which lies at the root of the problem. Ibn Saud’s advance has proceeded quietly but inexorably, for no apparent reason except that there, has been nothing to stop it. It is reasonable to suppose that, for a ruler of Ibn Saud’s prestige, it is easy to persuade desert tribes who are not under the control of any recognised ruler to say that they owe allegiance to himself, and unless some effective check to this natural and even inevitable process can be devised, it is likely to continue through the years until Ibn Saud’s authority extends to the very outskirts of the Trucial ports. There are only two ways, as far as Lord Halifax can see, of preventing this. The one is for His Majesty’s Government to lay down a frontier unilaterally and declare their intention of maintaining it by force of arms. The other is to agree with Ibn Saud upon a frontier which he will formally and openly recognise, and which he and his successors will thereafter be unable to disregard without providing His Majesty's Government with grounds for opposing them with a degree of vigour which could not be justified in the present anomalous situation. 8. There can be no question but that the second of these alternatives is much to be preferred, if it can be achieved. It cannot, however, be achieved without the cession to Ibn Saud of either the Jebel Naksh, which is impossible, or the Khor-el- Odeid, which is only possible with the acquiescence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. The position of the sheikh being what it is, he would have every reason to welcome the establishment of a settled frontier, more or less following the Riyadh line, in return for the surrender of a small area of empty desert adjacent to the Khor-el- Odeid, for which he can have little or no use, but which may have great value for Ibn Saud, both sentimentally and as a possible corridor for an oil pipe-line to the Persian Gulf. 9. Whether the sheikh can be persuaded to see his own interests in this light is, however, a separate problem, and on the assumption (which has yet to be proved) that he will refuse to do so, two main ways of compensating him still further for the loss of some of his territory have been considered. The first of these is a money payment and the second is an assurance of support in the event of a serious attack from the landward side. 10. Lord Halifax shares to the full the distaste which has been expressed for a money payment, because it clearly imports a questionable element into a settlement which can be justified on its own merits and which the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi ought to accept in his own interests. Nevertheless, if a money payment would secure the sheikh's acquiescence in a frontier settlement, His Majesty’s Government ought not, in his Lordship’s opinion, to hesitate to pay any reason able sum which might be necessary. He notes that it is impossible for the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to hazard a guess as to the sum which the sheikh would regard as adequate compensation, but looking at the question from another angle—that is to say, from the point of view of the value of a settlement to His Majesty’s Government—he considers that £25,000 or even a larger sum would not be too much.3 5 11. altei native, or additional, form of compensation is an undertaking P^ect the sheikh in the event of a land attack from Saudi Arabia. Loi d Halil ax notes that m the opinion of the Political Resident the first question which the sheikh would be likely to ask, if approached regarding the Khor-el- Odeid, would be : Will His Majesty’s Government guarantee this frontier as against Saudi Arabia ? ’ His Lordship considers that if it were necessary to secure the sheikh s concurrence, an endeavour should be made to meet to some extent his wishes on this point. The precise wording of any assurance given to the sheikh would need consideration. It would clearly be undesirable that His Majesty s Government should undertake any responsibility for intervening if some tribal elements on the Abu Dhabi side^of the frontier chose to repudiate the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and to declare allegiance to Ibn Saud; nor could His Majesty’s Government accept responsibility for the prevention of tribal raids from Saudi Arabian territory across the frontier. The undertakings to be assumed by His Majesty’s Government should be so worded as to apply only in the event of major aggression against Abu Dhabi on the part of the territorial sovereign on the other side of the frontier. 12. Lord Halifax is aware that assurances of this kind may seem to constitute an extension of the responsibilities of His Majesty’s Government. He realises that in particular strong objection is seen in many quarters to increasing the commitments of His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf by adding to the existing obligations to defend the Trucial sheikhs from aggression by sea an obligation to defend any one of them from aggression by land, and that the view has been expressed that if His Majesty’s Government were to undertake such an additional commitment it might necessitate an adjustment in the forces of His Majesty’s Government in the neighbourhood of the Gulf. His Lordship cannot help feeling, however, that these responsibilities already exist and the additional obligation would be more apparent than real. 13. In the first place, the fact that the air route along the Trucial Coast is a vital sector in the communications of the Empire means that His Majesty’s Government could not in practice allow any Power not under their influence to occupy any part of the coast or its immediate vicinity which was of importance for the air route. The only uncertainty is at what point His Majesty’s Govern ment are to consider that their position on the Trucial Coast would be threatened. At present they are free, so far as their formal obligations to the sheikhs are concerned, to allow the predominant Power in the adjacent parts of Arabia to extend its influence as far as the Trucial ports themselves. It is doubtful, however, whether His Majesty’s Government could even now remain inactive while the authority of one of the Trucial sheikhs was irreparably undermined in this wav, while in the event of a serious attack from Saudi Aiabia His Majestv s Government would in practice find themselves obliged to intervene to pi event the sheikh from being overwhelmed. 14. In the second place, if any oil company hereafter wishes as the result of a survey to undertake active operations m the intenor, it will not be able to do so unless it knows that the site of these operations lies to the north and east of a settled frontier, and once such operations had begun His Majesty’s Govern ment would inevitably be obliged to interest themselves in the maintenance of that frontier 15 Nevertheless, Lord Halifax is prepared to agree that every effort should be made to avoid the additional commitment involved in a definite guarantee of anv landward frontier which might eventually be fixed for the sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi as the outcome of the present discussion, and that the support of His Maiestv’s Government should be limited to a promise to intervene energetically with I bn Saud or his successors in the event of their disregarding the new frontier. 16 In the circumstances set forth above, Lord Halifax considers that His Maiesty’s Government should endeavour to grasp an opportunity which may not recur of settling this most difficult of frontier questions, and should to that end trv to nersuade the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi to part with the relatively small area nekssa P ry S give Ibn Saud access to the Khor-el-Odeid, if possible m return for a settled frontier but if necessary with the added inducements of a promise of general good offices in matters relating to that frontier and a money payment. But the fuestion still remains of what attitude His Majesty s Government should adopt if all these inducements fail in their object. Lord Halifax would not for a moment dispute the view that it would be wrong to bring pressure to bear uponany Trucial sheikh to act to his own disadvantage merely in order to further the interests of His Majesty’s Government. But in this case the action proposed is manifestly not to the sheikh’s disadvantage. Moreover, His Majesty’s Govern ment are surely entitled to take into account the fact that without their protection not one of the Trucial sheikhs could last for a day against Ibn Saud, and to expect from these sheikhs a greater degree of co-operation in matters affecting the interests of His Majesty’s Government than many of them have seemed disposed to show in recent years. 17. This being so, Lord Halifax feels that in the event of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi proving obdurate, he should be informed that this is a case in which His Majesty’s Government must insist, in the interests of his people and successors, on his following their advice, in return for which they will promise to take up on his behalf all matters affecting his landward frontiers and (at the discretion of the Political Resident) a money payment, which might be disguised as compensation for the loss of imaginary dues or revenues from the ceded territory. 18. The question of the effect which such an attitude might have upon the prestige of His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf is one upon which Lord Halifax naturally expresses an opinion with diffidence. But he suggests that, provided no injustice is done, a show of firmness in such a situation ought not to diminish the prestige of His Majesty’s Government, but rather to enhance it. It may be argued that this might be so, but for the fact that to the Trucial sheikhs it would appear that His Majesty’s Government were being firm with one of themselves because they dared not be firm with Ibn Sand. Lord Halifax recognises the force of this argument, but he sees no reason why the advantages to the sheikhs of a settled frontier should not be understood locally. It might, indeed, be represented to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi that Ibn Saud is the friend of the British and has throughout his career (unlike certain lesser Arab rulers of no importance who are ignorant of world affairs) shown himself consistently well disposed to His Majesty’s Government and anxious in all circumstances to consult their interests; so that His Majesty’s Government, for their part, have no hesitation in asking the sheikh to contribute his share towards an agreement which is considered to be advantageous to all parties. 19. There remains to be considered the opinion expressed by the Government of India, that there are political objections to making a breach in the line of territory under British control at present stretching along the coast of the Persian Gulf from Qatar to Muscat or to admit further Saudi access to the Gulf. The Service Departments are understood to be satisfied that there are no strategical disadvantages to be apprehended from Saudi access to the Khor-el-Odeid, and it seems clear that such access will not give Ibn Saud any greater opportunities for expanding his influence upon the Trucial Coast than he already possesses at the present time. On the contrary, a settled frontier between his territories and those of the Trucial sheikhs would set definite limits to such expansion. Lord Halifax finds it difficult in these circumstances to form a clear idea of the nature of the political objections, and in any case these objections do not in his opinion outweigh the wider political advantages of securing a frontier settlement with Ibn Saud. 20.

It is a reply to the note, a copy of which was sent to the Foreign Office with my printed despatch No. 72, dated the 14th April, in which the right of His Majesty’s Government to keep the American oil company concerned informed of the frontier situation was reiterated, and it deals also in principle. with the question of prospecting for oil in the disputed zone. It will be seen that the Saudi Govern ment do no more than repeat their offer to refrain from prospecting in the disputed zone until a frontier agreement is arrived at, provided that His Majesty’s Govern ment will ensure that a similar policy of abstention is observed from the Qatar side. 2. In my telegram No. 56 dated the 7th March, I reported Fuad Bey’s “ personal ” opinion as to the sort of solution that might be acceptable to his Government. Fuad Bey went to Syria on leave soon after that, and had I been in a position to give him my views on his opinion, the reply was to be sent to him there. It is possible that the Saudi Arabian Government have been waiting for such a reply, but their reference to Fuad Bey may have resulted from their con sciousness that he is the only person in their employ who thoroughly understands the bilingual correspondence on this subject and can be trusted to write a clear reply. 3. The deadlock is still complete. The only hopeful feature in the situation is that the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company are more and more inclined to believe that the oil-field in Hasa is extremely rich. If this belief is well-founded, Ibn Sand’s bitterness on the frontier question, in so far as it has an economic basis, should diminish with time, though an increase in his income will not make him less touchy on the point of prestige. 4. On looking through the file, I see that, owing to a regrettable oversight, the Saudi note which I summarised briefly in my telegram No. 40 of the 23rd Feb- m arv was never sent to you. A translation is enclosed. 1 expect to pioceed to England on leave in a few days, and this question can perhaps be considered once more while I am at home, though I have no useful suggestions to make. All we can do, it seems, is to revert to our proposal for a preliminary examination of the area in dispute, which is little more than a device by which we hope to convince the Saudi authorities that Jabal Nakhsh is an integral part of the small Jabal Dukhan range. If the invitation which I have received holds good and I spend a few weeks at Ibn Sand’s camp in Nejd next spring, it might perhaps be possible to organise a visit to the Qatar boundary for this purpose. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch, with copies of enclosures, to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire and the Secretary to the Governmest of India in the External Affairs Department at Simla. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. Enclosure 1. Saudi Government to Sir R. Bullard. ^Excellency Sir Reader Bullard, , , I REGRET the delay in replying to your note dated the 14th April, 1938, due the necessity of enquiring from the Deputy Minister for the Ministry for jreio-n Affairs as to certain information which he has concerning the matter in lestfon, while he, as you are aware, is on sick leave. [355 bb—1]2 Your Excellency’s note under reference has been studied, and I am able to explain to your Excellency the opinion of the Government of the Saudi Arabian Kingdom thereon. 1. The Government of the Saudi Arabian Kingdom have already informed the British Government of their non-recognition of the Blue Line, and that they did not consider it(’s existence) as a proper reason for the surrender of territories and places which are under their control, and in their possession from ancient and in recent times. 2. Our Government do not recognise the validity of any orders which any Government may give to individuals or companies in their country. It is the right of our Government and no one else to give such information. 3. His Majesty the King always desires—it is his habit—not to create any difficulty for his neighbours, and particularly for the British Government. He therefore hopes that the frontier question may be settled at their earliest convenience. 4. With a view to the obviation of disputes at the present time until after the conclusion of a definite agreement with Qatar in respect of the delimitation of the frontiers, he is prepared to give special orders to the California-Arabian Standard Oil Company to the effect that they must not cross the maximum limit of the frontiers as proposed by the British Government, provided that Qatar undertakes to prevent the oil company in their territory from crossing the maximum limit, as requested by our Government, until after the conclusion of a definite agreement in respect of the frontiers. If the British Government agree to this (solution) our Government is prepared to accept it. With highest respects, FEYSAL, ' Minister for Foreign A ffairs. Enclosure 2. Saudi Government to Sir R. Bullard. (Translation.) Your Excellency, Mecca, February 16, 1938. I HAVE received your Excellency’s letter, dated the 3rd February, regarding the south-eastern frontiers. The Government of His Majesty desire nothing better than to be in agreement with the British Government on every subject of common interest and to have a complete understanding on all matters. They have already exerted and are still exerting their endeavours, as the British Government are aware, to settle every question in a manner satisfactory to both parties and calculated to secure their common interests. One of the points on which they have spent their efforts in order to bring the two parties nearer to each other is the settlement of the question of the south-eastern frontiers between Saudi Arabia and the x\rab amirates on the Persian Gulf in a manner satisfactory to all and calculated to secure the lawful interest of both parties. You state that your Government have shown a spirit of great conciliation in the matter of the frontier to which my Government hold, whereas the position to which my Government hold has remained unchanged. It is true that that is the apparent position, but if you will examine the spirit of conciliation actually shown by my Government, it will prove to you that they have gone very far indeed towards meeting the wishes of their friends the British Government. When the question of this frontier was first raised in London and Jedda, the position of my Government was clear, viz., that what they hold to is all the territories which belonged to the fathers and grandfathers of His Majesty the King; and these, of course, include much wider areas than the frontier to which their claims were subsequently limited. As you are aware, the agreement of 1915 plainly recognises as belonging to His Majesty the King what belonged to his fathers and grandfathers. A satisfactory adhesion to the text of that agree ment would make a large part of the Hadhramaut, Dhufar, Oman, Abu Dhabi and Qatar fall within the territories of His Majesty the King, and an historical examination (of the facts) shows that the posts at Abr and Bairami and Dhifar and in the middle of Qatran were Saudi posts founded by the forefathers of His Majesty the King in the last century. Nevertheless, His Majesty the King, (was) jsirous th.

As to encroachin letter of 3 : to your Ex bow the m belp to ck solution o As tc Majesty’s !o enquire that the n might res I aw forth abo3 desirous that there should be agreement and understanding with the British Government, and that his friends among the Arab rulers on the Persian Gulf should not be deprived, even though that should involve himself in material loss. All this caused him, after strong insistence, to limit his claims to the minimum, hoping (thereby) to put a decisive end to the difficulties. It never entered into His Majesty s thoughts that what he mentioned would be a subject of argument and dispute. The line to which my Government holds represents the minimum of their legitimate and reasonable claims; consequently, your Excellency’s statement that the conciliation and concession have come from the British Government, while the position of my Government has not changed, indicates disdain for the Govern ment of His Majesty and forgetfulness of the great sacrifices which they have made in renouncing in favour of the rulers of those neighbouring Arab territories wide areas whose ownership by His Majesty can be proved by every historical and actual right. It never entered into the thoughts of my Government to bargain about the frontier which they put forward, for it was drawn after deep reflection and careful consideration; and it was on account of the insistence of the British Government that it was drawn so as to cover the very minimum of the just claims. Had my Government thought that it would be the subject of discussion and bargaining, they would have taken up a different position, whereas they limited their claims to the minimum, hoping that the British Government would not argue about it, but would accept it as a just and practical frontier in the interests of both parties. I do not conceal from your Excellency that my Government attaches the greatest importance to this frontier and regards it is a very vital matter. Nay, more : I can say that this question is a question of life and death in con nexion with that part of His Majesty’s dominions. They, therefore, regret exceedingly that the British Government do not appreciate their position at its true value; at the same time, however, they express their readiness to discuss any practical proposal which will secure the interests of both parties and obviate harm. As to the abstention by employees of the companies on both sides from encroaching on the disputed areas, the Deputy Foreign Minister in his personal letter of 3/12/1356 (the 3rd February, 1938) explained the essence of the position to your Excellency as my Government understand it, and in it he explained exactly how the matter stood. I hope that there may be sufficient explanation therein to help to clear up the present misunderstanding and to bring about a fundamental solution of the difficulties. As to the question of the appointment of a topographical commission, His Majesty’s Government, before giving a definite reply to the request, would like to enquire from your Government as to the areas required to be surveyed in order that the matter may be sufficiently clear to both sides, and that the confusion which might result if the agreement were general and not precise may be avoided. I await, therefore, the opinion of your Government on the three points set forth above. FEYSAL.61/31 P5RS0HAL C/o Lloyds Bank Ltd.
