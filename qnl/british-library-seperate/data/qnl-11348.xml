                           Indian Daily Telegraph, and written by an unnamed Indian Muslim. A copy of another letter, written by Long, dated 7 July 1916, precedes the main letter, in which Long describes the views of the Muslim as being ‘pro-Young Turk’, and a ‘fair exposition’ of the views of Indian Muslims. The letter from the Indian Muslim concerns Britain’s policy of non-intervention in the Holy Places of Islam, the Arab Revolt, and the bombardment of Jeddah in the Hedjaz [Hejaz/al-Ḥijāz] by a British naval vessel on 10 June 1916. The correspondent warns that the Arab revolt may hand the Turks a moral and military advantage, and cautions against British and Allied involvement in the Hejaz.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Hejaz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Jeddah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arab Revolt (1916-1918)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00025d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00025d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
