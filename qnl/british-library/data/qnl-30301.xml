I have no objection to the expedition in question carrying out their surveys and they are permitted to come to Salalah to make the necessary trans- port arrangements. It is understood that the personnel of the expedition will stay at the aerodrome while in Salad.ah and will observe all my rules. Further if khe number of the party exceeds twelve then they should bring their rations with them. The Wali of Dhofar will try his best to arrange for them to visit Rami at Mug shin and its surroundings only: Dakaka is beyond the boundry of Dhofar and I regret that it will be impossible for the expedition to visit this area during during this summer. It might be possible for them to visit Dakaka/the winter. While the Wali will give all possible assistance in the matter, the question of security in wild and remote places such as these should rest with the&gt;nimbers of the Anti-Locust expedition themselves and it should be understood that if any thing happens-God forbid-then no question will be raised by your Government on the subject. Further I would suggest that the expedition should be armed. I have discussed these matters with your assistant and tfiere are a few points which he kindly made note of and I shall be glad if a reply is sent before the arrival of the party.

Though Sultan would doubtless give what assistance he could, arrangements for proposed reconnaissance would have to be negotiated direct with and prin cipal Sheikhs concerned; and, whifafr ordinarily there would be no objection to this.

Whll©nature of their desire to see him is not known with cer tainty, Sultan 1 s own impression is that they wish to discuss whole question of his future relations with Oman in the event of the Imam Y s death. He hopes to persuade the more important Sheikhs to accompany him to Muscat, if their attitude at Sur proves satisfactory. 3- If Sultan *8 impression is correct - which seems likely - it is clearly desirable that we should avoid doing anything likely to embarrass him during his conversations, and in view of these circumstances I would prefer not to raise ques tion of facilities for Locust Party until Sultan has returned to Muscat position is cleared. 4* I shall 'tfe grateful for early instructions. ■—y S' lib- S. 6.

INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL,INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.l. Sir, EXT,1776/45 H April, 194-5. The following resolution dealing with international co-operation in the campaign against the Desert Locust was adopted by a conference recently converted at Cairo by the Government of Egypt in conjunction with the Middle East Supply Centre and attended by technical representatives of the Governments of Egypt, India, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Transjordan, Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, Turkey, U.S.S.R. and the United Kingdom:- ■’The Conference being impressed by the benefits of international co-operation during the war period considers it essential that steps should be taken at an early date to prepare a practical scheme for establishing a permanent international organisation for the prevention of outbreaks of the Desert Locust”• 2, It has been apparent to H.M.G. for some time that the comparative degree of success obtained by present arrangements for the co-ordination of anti-locust campaigns in the Middle East and Eastern Africa points the way to the establishment on a permanent basis of some international scheme for the purpose. Present arrangements, however, have their origin purely in temporary and war-time exigencies particularly connected with the urgent necessity of saving shipping space and H.M.G.could not contemplate a continuance of the expenditure on anti-locust work, at present borne by the U.K.Exchequer, in peace-time conditions when present considerations no longer apply. /3. The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.3. ^ H.ivi.G. are therefore in general agreement with the terms of the resolution quoted in paragraph 1 above and a draft scheme of which a copy is enclosed herewith has been drawn up by the Inter-Departmental Committee for Locust Control for the establishment of such a permanent international organisation. The Governments of the various territories mentioned in paragraph 1 of the draft scheme have been invited to offer their comments^ on it and have been asked whether they would be willing to ^ attend a conference at some convenient centre with a view to drawing up a convention based on the draft scheme and whether they would be prepared to contribute financially to the scheme. 4. I shall be glad if you will consider how the Sultan of Muscat might most suitably be associated with the scheme and ii he could be approached for his co-operation in tejaas which you consider suitable to his status and position. / From the geographical point of view Oman would of course occupy a positio'^'' of considerable importance in any scheme which may be worked out/ and with regard to finance it may be that the Sultan's contribution might best be made in kind and services rather than in monetary form. It may be noted that the estimates submitted with the draft scheme are only of a tentative nature for the purpose of indicating broadly the measure of expenditure. 3. .

Bushire on this subject and they have been advised to obtain the approval of H.H. the' Sultan through your office. I understand that you will have already been approached by the M.B.S. C. on this subject, but as Mr. Thesiger, who will be undertaking the work, is now with me I take this opportunity of sending you a full pro gramme of the work it is hoped to do. JHOfAh The first journey Thesiger would undertake, preferably during June to August, is to the interior of Bhofar to the north of Jebel Qara as far as the border 01 the Bub Al Khali at B ami at Si Mugshin. The object is to find out if locusts breed either in the wadis or where the wadis flow against the sand. It is proposed that he should cross Jebel ^ara to the head of one of the northern wadis, and then, following a course to the east of the one used by Bertram Thomas, travel to the sanas of the Bub Al Khali. He would then make journeys both to the east and west to ex plore that country and when these c*re completed he will ret&amp;rn to Salala by a new route parallel to the one tamen on his outward journey. Thesiger proposes to travel very light and he considers one good riding camel and two baggage camels would suffice ior his own needs. This of course will not include the camels required by the guides and escort if considered necessary, or for carrying the food and water lor these people. 'When the permission of the Sultan has been obtained I would be very grateful if you could cause pre liminary arrangements to be maae with the proper author ities for obtaining guides, hiring camels and buying the waterskins and food necessary for the party. 1 might ada that as I expect imports are scarce I have suggested to the M.E.S.C. that a certain amount of rice, flour, tea and sugar be maae available irom army stocks.3 heet ^ OiV.Uil'i It v;cls originally intended that I should undertake this journey and I have already asked our Locust Gfiicer, Capt Joyce, to aiscuss the plan with you which I under stand he has already done. It now seems probable that I shall be engaged on other work and so Thesiger proposes to make the journey in question during September to November alter he has completed his investigations in Lhofar. 1 should be very pleased to learn if you have a chance to aiscuss this plan with rhe Sultan ana to hear his reactions to it.

Preliminary talks at Muscat between Sultdn and Sheikhs Sulaiman bin Hamiyar of Jebel Akdhar and Ali bin Abdu la of Beni bu All have confirmed Sultanas earlier impressions reported in my Express letuer No. 7?S-23/3 of 28th. April and position up to my departure from Muscat was as follows; (a) Poth Sheikhs had declared that they would ta] e no part in election of Imam’s successor. (b) Both had placed themselves under the ’’Orders” of the Sultan. (c) A declaration similar to (&amp;) had been received from Sheikh Isa bin Saleh of Sharqiyah. (d) Sultan had received letter from I an informing him of desoatch of emissary to discuss ’’imnortant Questions’ 1 . 3. With these two powerful Ghafiri Sheikhs on his side and with assurance of Isa’s neutrality Sultan entertains hopes of eventual collapse of Imamate and extension of his influence throughout Oran. 4. • Sultan does not wish to appear unhelpful over anti-locust meas res, but considers that apart from possibility of lack of eecubity resulting from future developments, presence of locust party in Oman would remove his jFreedom of action in matter which he naturally regards as of highest importance. He would be grateful, therefore, if proposed reconnais sance could be postponed until next year. 5. I understand expedition was to have been led by Thesiger after his return from Ramlat Mughshin.

Whether serious damage to crops will occur depends upon further developments during the next two months but already the potential danger is far greater than at any time since the devastating invasion of 1928-31. 2. At the Cairo Locust conference last January all territories were warned that the present situation was likely to develop. Within the limits of available resources preparations were made to fight the locust in its Arabian and South Persian breeding grounds, but through shortage of transport and personnel many swarms are likely to escape. 3. 1 trust therefore that you will do everything in your power to assist the various anti-locust organisations during any emerganey that may arise, realising that upon the success of their efforts may depend the prevention of conditions approaching famine in the countries of the Middle East likely to be affected by this grave threat.

Reference your dated the I2th May, 1945. 2. A copy of letter No S/6, dated the I2th August, 1945, from His Highness the Sultan is enclosed for your information. Although His Highness has shown great caution in defining the extent of the assistance he is prepared to give, the terms of the letter show a co-operative attitude and may be consider^ as satisfactory. 3. In the circumstances at present prevailing in Oman, the operation of locust parties in places other them the settled coastal areas requires careful consideration and preparation and His Highness 1 desire not to be bound by the proposed scheme is probably based principally on consideration of these circumstances. It is assumed that in the event of the establishment of an international organisation, locust matters will be referred to the Muscat Government through the political authorities as before.

Although it is not possible to make an accurate forecast for several months ahead, the present indications are that the extent of locust infestation in Arabia and other countries in the Middle East in 1945/46 may continue on much the same scale as in 1244/45, though possibly there may be a slight decrease in intensity. Having regard to this forecast it was agreed at a recent meeting of the Interdepartmental Committee on Locust Control that it was highly desirable, in order to ^reserve the 1 ood stocks of the Middle East,to endeavour to continue anti- locnst operations, particularly in Arabia, on the same scale as last season. It was, however, realised that owing to the demobilisation measures in progress in the Middle East, follow ing the end of hostilities in Europe, the Army authorities would be unable to continue to afford as much assistance as hitnerto in the form of transport and personnel, and that, in these circumstances, it would probably be necessary to reduce the scale of such operations. It now appears doubtful whether the Army authorities v/ill be in a position to give sufficient assistance to enable the Middle East Anti-Locust Unit to mount even a small scale campaign , and it is clear that the end of the war with Japan will render it still more difficult for the Army authorities to afford adequate assistance. / 3.

W* 1 • 14th September, 1945« Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State to refer to my letter E. &amp; 0. 5743/45 of 11th August relating to plans for an Anti-Locust Campaign in the Middle East during the coming winter* It now appears to be increasingly diivicult to launch an Anti- Locust Campaign not only in Persia but also in Arabia. The main difficulty is that as a result of the end of hostilities the military authorities will not be able to provide assistance on the scale necessary to launch a Campaign. A number of Army officers with Anti-Locust experience who were being relied upon for continuing the Campaign have been released from the Army and have left the Middle Sast and the technical Army staff which was necessary for wireless work and transport has been much reduced* The Middle East Anti-Locust unit has also lost two of its civilian locust officers. It seems to be particularly undesirable that the Anti-Locust Campaign should be discontinued at the present juncture since there is a possibility that at a later date the work could be handed over to the proposed International Anti-Locust Organisation* It has been suggested that the countries bordering on Arabia might be invited to add their own resources to such resources as H*K.G-* may also be able to provide for ai\y forthcoming Canpaign. Any advice or other assistance which the Government of India may be able to offer would be greatly appreciated.

( n 5. iis regards the former question ( i. e. the campaign during this winter) the situation has changed since my letter of 1st October was written. As a result of discussions in Cairo and London it has been lound possible to provide for an anti-locust campaign in Arabia on the same scale as last year.

With regard to the proposal that the countries bordering Lrabia should co-operate with His Majesty’s Government to avoid possible abandonment of the 1945-46 campaign (you» despatch No. 1254 [CS 895/18/45] of September 10) you are doubtless aware that operations m Lrabia by Middle East Lnti-Locust Unit during the present winter on approximately the same scale as ^ last year have now been assured by Treasury sanction for expenditure of £85,000 Ls however it will not be possible for His Majesty's Government to continue to bear the whole of the cost of such campaigns in future it is desirable that the proposed international conference should be held early in 1946 with a view to setting up a permanent control organisation - as soon as possible. Please press the Egyptian Government for an early reply to proposals for conference and establishment of permanent international organisation for control of desert locust. Cairo would probably be the most suitable centre for the conference. It is evident that this choice would meet with general approval, but you will no doubt leave it to the Egyptian Government to make the suggestion.

Proposed Autumn Exploration of^ Interior Oman by Major Thesiger. v v v j .J', v s . tc£ } .2‘ S' 'BRITISH MIDBI^E BAST OFFICE 10 Sharia Tolumhat, Cairo, 23.1.46 Bear political Resident, With reference to the attached note by the Chief Locust Off icer on Major Thesiger’s explor ations of southern Arabia, it will be seen that it is suggested that a further attempt should be made to penetrate interior Oman next autumn. 2. When, last year, you approached the3ultan of Muscat with the same object, he considered that t proposed journey was impracticable owing the the political unrest ita the interior. I hope that conditions now may be more favourable, and that you will feel able to address a further request to the Sultan. 3 . There is no doubt that Major Thesiger is doing most valuable work, and any assistance you can give will be much appreciated. Yours sincerely 3d. Illegible Political Resident Persian Gulf./ OBSERVATIO NS • • •••••#• ■■■■■MU &lt; lly MIDDLE EAST ANTI-LOCUST UNIT THSSIBER MISSION - SOUTH ERN ARABIA. Plans for Further Exploration. IflTRODUCTIOE . Major Thesiger of the Middle East Anti-Locust Unit returned to Salala in early, January from his two months camel exploration of S.E.Arabia. Leaving Salala in early November, Thesiger proceeded to North West to Ramlat Mitan (5230E 1850N) then eastwards to Shisur (5325E 1820N) and along the Ramlat umm al Hait to Mursaudid (b415E 1925N). He then went North into the sands of Ghanim back to Mugshin and on north-east wards into the sands of Sahama almost to Umm as-Samia (5550E 2110N). He then returned to Mugshin and proceed ed South via the Wadi Katibit to Salala. Thesiger has therefore penetrated several unknown areas and although full details of his observations must await his return to Cairo, his preliminary notes include important records of locust breeding and climate. In November, he struck what appeared to be the eastern fringe of an extensive locust breeding area that he thinks extends from the Y/adi Kadramaut eastwards to Ramlat Rasad (5300E 1845N) , whilst it was reported that locusts had also bred in the summer in the sands of Ghanim and Sahama. These observations throw new light on the course of the locust cycle in Arabia• SECOND EXPLORATION Thesiger has probably already left Salala on a further reconnaissance which will carry him on an arc north and west to Terim (5844E 1603N) in the Wadi Kadramaut through an area which has received exceptional rainfall and where heavy locust breeding has occurred. He is due at Terim by 7th March. FURTHER PLANS. If political approval is secured and if conditions appear favourable, Thesiger wishes to continue northwards from Terim across the sands to Sulaiyil (4535E 2030N) in the southern Nejd. This route is traversed by raid ing parties and Thesiger believes he can get across, especially as it has been a year of exceptional rainfall. It will, however, be impossible to attempt the journey if he is delayed at Terim. Should the passage across the sands seem impossible, Thesiger then suggests travelling further west to Abha (4230E 1813N) in Asir. Prom either Sulaiyil or Abha he would presumably continue to Jedda. AUTUMN exploration. Thesiger’s tentative proposals for further work in the autumn, cover exploration of interior Oman. He suggests leaving Sharjah in September or October, work ing down via Ibri (5620S 2310N; to the Umm as-Samim area (5640E 2110N), across the Jaddat Al Harasis to Jazir (5640E 1835N). ' He would then wish to return to Sharjah under the south-western slopes of the mountains.■ - 2 - 0 B SiCRV AT IONS. Thesiger * s plans have the full support of this office and if they can he implemented we shall add very greatly to our knowledge and shall be able to plan future anti-locust operations and organise the locust intelligence service with increased confidence. To complete his programme, Thesiger requires approval and full support and letters are being addressed to the following requesting early action:- (a) The Governor of Aden - to enlist the assistance of the Resident Adviser, Mukal a, for Thesiger’s arrival at Terim, his refitting and departure. Also to arrange supplies of food and currency at Terim. (b) H#b.M Minister, Jedda - to request approval from H.M.King Ibn Saud for Thesiger to approach southern Nejd or Asir from the south. (c) The Political Resident, Persian Gulf - to make tentative enquirie5~ of the Sultan of Muscat regarding the possibility of undertaking the autumn exploration of interior Oman. Sd. O.B.

No. C 253-23/3 To I have the following comments to offer on Major Thesiger’s proposed expedition in Oman referred to in the enclosure to your Express Letter No. 229-S dated the 13th February, 1946. 2 I can see no objection to Major Thesiger visiting the Dhahirah area excluding Ibri, and feel that the Sultan would now agree to this. In this connection please see my telegrams No.S 1087 dated the 8th August, 1945 and No.S 1141 dated the 21st August, 1945# So far as the journey to Ibri and neighbourhood is concerned there has been little change in the political affairs of the interior since the Sultan advised against an expedition into Oman from the north last year, and his attitude towards any proposal for penetration into territory within the Imamate would certainly be unfavourable. The Sultan has no direct relations with the Shaikhs of the Ibri locality and in present circum stances could not be expected either to agree to negotiating himself with the Imam, or to willingly acquiesce to negotiations being undertaken direct. He is, moreover, most anxious to avoid anything which might affect his freedom of action in any future developments in the Imamate, v/hich the presence of an anti-locust expedition there mirht easily do --particularly in the event of the death of the Imam. In this connection reference is invited to correspondence on the subject of assistance to the Sultan resting with my telegram No.C 99 dated the l c th February. I am therefore of the opinion that for the present expeditions into any area within the Imsmate should be avoided. 5'. r,« vu In regatfld to limm as-Samim, Harasis and Jazir areas the 3. political objections described in paragraph 2 of this letter do not apply, and I can see no objection to the Sultan being approached for his views as to the practicability of exploration of these areas from the south— if this is considered important, I have very little recent information regarding this remote part of Oman as relations between the Janaba and Yal Wahiba tribes on the coast and the Sultan v;ere never close and, since the establishment of the Royal Air Force base at Masirah, ceased altogether. It is certain that Kis highness would find it difficult to re-establish relations with these tribes to enable him to undertake negotiations in the time available and it is also certain that he would not, and indeed could not, accept any responsibility for the safety (Signature) S. 44.

Draft convention prepared by H. M. Government as basis of discussion is being forwarded by air mail. It contains no reference to the participation of Muscat. Govern ment of India (Agricultural Department telegram No. 5890 of 6 th July) have suggested that it would be useful to invite representatives of Muscat to the conference, but it appears from your memorandum under reference that Sultan will not wish to be bound by the organisation. I should, however, be glad to have your observations. Invitations to Governments are * being issued by the Government of Egypt. 3.

In view of the circumstances prevailing in the interior it is difficult for the Sultan to enter into any general commitments regarding Anti-Locust measures and I therefore consider it most unlikely that he will wish to alter his decision not to be bound by such an Organisation. It may however be assumed that the Muscat Government will do whatever they reasonably can to assist Anti-Locust measures in their territories. -y Political Agent, Muscat. (Signature) S. 44.

As regards other Arab Sheikhdoms, apart from liuscat, it will be all to the good if those can be included within the scope of the Convention. This could be done either under Article 1 , or Article 17 (a), but the agreement of the Rulers concerned will presumably need to be obtained first. The question whether any of the Sheikhdoms will be prepared to contribute will also need to be considered. The six British Colonial or mandated territories referred to with the U.K. Government in Article 1 will each bo contributing from their own revenues, and H.li.G. are proposing to hold out for the right of each to express its own views and individually.

The Sultan was interested to hear of Mr. Thesiger’s exploit, but said that he would prefer that Mr. Ihesiger should not come to Muscat« The reason he ' r ave was that he had found that Mr. Thesiger was over paying the camel men and that as a result of his recent operations in the Mahra country a camel man was not obtainable for less than $ 4^ day plus rations. He said this price was far too high and would affect a possible exploration by Oil Companies should they wish to operate in that area in future. For Mr. altounyan’s recent geological survey he had with the greatest of difficult obtained camels at $ 4^ a day without rations. It is possible that the Sultan's real objection arises out of the unsatisfactory results of the proposal that Mr. Thesiger should take over his Ministry of -external ( i^ffairs. - Oj l ltd. 28th March 194S.A Tplegr-.H.
