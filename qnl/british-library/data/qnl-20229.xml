I Lave the honour to transmit to you herewith, extracted from Ze Temps of this eyening, an article by ]V1 . Marcel Eonffie, describing the negotiations with regard to the Baghdad Eailway up to the present date. I hare, etc., FEANCIS BERTIE.Munich of the Berlin Imperial Bank, stated to my informant that negotiations were going on between Paris and London with regard to the participation of French and English capital in the undertaking, and that until these negotia tions had made more progress he was reluctant to discuss the situation of the Bagdad Railway. This much, however, my informant obtained from Herr Tischler that Germany's desire for the participation of foreign capital was clearly indicated by the international character given to all publications, state ments and appeals made by the German Syndicate as to the construction of the railway, but Germany never would nor could consent to yield up her pre rogatives, that is to say, the control of the enterprise; and if the participation of foreign capital could only be obtained by the surrender of her position, she would renounce such foreign assistance, and in his opinion she would be able, if put to it, to obtain the necessary financial help in this country for the com pletion of the enterprise, but he added that Germany would prefer at present not to have to face such an eventuality. Prom inquiries I have made from persons connected with the Munich Bourse, I gather that scarcely anybody here lakes the slightest interest in the Bagdad scheme or holds any shares in that enterprise ; in fact I am told that no quotations are made as to the shares of the company as there is no business done here with regard to them. A financial person stated that there was 'keine Stimmung ' (no interest) among Bavarian investors for very distant enterprises, but in his opinion there seemed to be a slight change in this attitude of quite recent date, for he had noticed that there was some disposition to invest in a new Siamese Loan, and this might be taken as an indication that should the Bagdad Bailway Syndi cate try to float a loan in Germany, a certain amount, though piobably small, might be subscribed in Munich. I may add that the presence of Herr Dernburg in South Germany and the propaganda he is carrying on in favour of mining, railway, and other under takings in ihe Colonies, as reported in my despatch No. 4, Confidential, of the 23rd instant, is not unlikely to arouse in the public, perhaps only temporarily, an interest in speculative enterprises in distant countries. {Received, on the 11th March 1907, with letter from the Secretary, Political Department, India Office, London, No, 8, dated the 22nd February 1907.)

Reference notes on Towns along the Trace of Bagdad Hail way from West to East. 1. Adana. Adana is a town of 645,000 iuliabitants, and the capital of a vilayet. There are about 10,000 Armenians and Greeks, and the remainder are Turks and fellah Arabs, with a strange admixture of Ansarie Persians, Afghans, and some Hindoos. In harvest time, for the wheat and cotton harvest, about 5,000 more labourers come into the town. It is a very flourishing town, the centre for the rich Cilician Plain, and has some large cotton mills, with good bazaars and shops. The town is on the right bank of the Saihun, a broad deep stream, which supplies the best drinking water. Spring and autumn somewhat unhealthy, with a damp heat in summer. Extensive vineyards and gardens, irrigated by water-wheels, surround the place. 2. Missis. Missis is a small place of 200 houses ; about 1,000 inhabitants, chiefly Moslems, with 70 Armenians, Greeks, and Cretan refugees on the right bank of the River Jaibun, where the Adana-Alexandretta road crosses by albridge. 3. Jlexandrelta. Alexandretta is the seaport of the Aleppo Province, and connected with that town by a good metalled road. It is the seat of a Kaimakam under Allepo ; contains some liOOO houses, with 10,000 inhabitants, of w r honi two-thirds are Greek, built close alon 0, the shore of the bay on a low-lying, shingly promontory. The bay forms the best and most secure anchorage along the coast; large vessels can anchor from 200 to 400 yards from the shore in 7 to 10 fathoms, and discharge into lighters. Only a ftw light wooden jetties exist at present' but with little trouble an excellent harbour and landing facilities could be created. Water is from two large springs at the foot of the hills, l^ miles to the south brought in by ducts. The marshes, which lay in this direction, and were the cause of much malarial fever, have recently been fllled in, and the health of the place has improved.9 In the districts close rourd the port some 4,000 tons of cereals are produced annually, whilst the extensive and fertile plain of Adana. the ancient Cilician Plain, lies north of the GuK of Alexandietta, and not far distant. Payas, on the coast, a few miles north of Alexandretta, is famous for its oranges. Several lines of steamers call at Alexandretta. The Prince Line from Newcastle, the Leyland, Moss and Bell's Asia Minor Lines, the Pappayanui Line from Liverpool, the Khedivial Mail from Alexandria, with the Messa- geries Maritimes, Austro-Hungarian Lloyd, German Levant Line, Italian, Greek and Turkish Lines. There are Austrian and Prench Post Offices. A British Yice-Consul, and Consulates of other Powers. 4 Country between Alexandretta and Aleppo. Immediately east of Alexandretta, the road leads over the Pailan Pass, in the Amanus (Giaour Dagh) Range. The range is sparsely wooded, has numerous ravines, and the summit of the pass by which the ' chau^see ' crosses is 1,980 feet above sea-level. Mr. Pauling, who in 1896 specially reported on the practicability of a railway, thought the line could cross the hills just south of the road by a short tunnel, and no great difficulties of construction would be involved. Beyond the Amanus is a wide valley, through the southern end of which passes the Orontes, and which also contains a large marshy lake, the borders of which forms an excellent pasturage for cattle, sheep, and horses during the summer, but which in spring extends over and floods the country for some distance. A branch road leads down to Antioch, near the mouth of the Orontes, the centre of a fertile district. To the north, a long depression, with several small, marshy lakes and streams, runs up to Marash, at the foot of the Taurus. This district is not as populous as mio'ht be owing chiefly to the malaria caused by the numerous lakes, but it could be improved. The direct route to Aleppo passes through the stony ridges of Kalaat Saman, which the ' chaussee ' avoids by a wide bend to the north through well cultivated level ground, which extends up to and. beyond Killis. 5. Aiitioch {Aniakia). Antioch is a well-built town of 25,000 inhabitants, among extensive gardens, on the left bank of the Orontes, Steep hills rise to the south, and the valley is filled with gardens. It is the seat of a Kaimakam under Aleppo, and a rich trading centre for cereals, cotton, and liquorice root. The ruins and walls of the old town extend some distance outside the modern limits of the town. A good road leads to Alexandretta over the Bailan Pass. 6. Aleppo (Haleh). Aleppo has a population of 108,000, of whom some 25,800 are Christians and 8,000 Jews ; is the capital of a vilayet, and the most important commercial centre in North Syria. The town is built on undulating ground chiefly on the left bank of the Koweik, a small stream from the north, which almost dries in summer, and is bordered by gardens in the vicinity oi the town. In the centre are the large barracks erected by Ibrahim Pasha during the Egyptian occupation. The streets are well paved and wide enough for carts. The bazars are extensive, and roofed over for the most part with houses of stone, many two-storied. The chief importance of Aleppo is its position as a centre of all the trade routes of North Syria. It connects on the north w 7 ith the fertile and populous districts of Killis and Aintab, extending up to Marash at the foot of the Taurus. 5351 f. d.10 Eastward, towards the Euphrates, is a fertile district recently settled with numerous villages and many thriving Settlements of Circassians. Important trade routes cross the Euphrates at Brijik, from Diarbekr; while there is also communication down the Euphrates Valley with Meskene, Hakka, Deir- ez-zor, and eventually Bagdad. To the south the railway is now open to Rayak Junction on the Damascus-Bt 1 !rout linej passing through Homs and Hama. It is broad gauge to Hayak, where a change is made to the narrow (l - 05 metre) gauge of the line across the Lebanon to Beirout or Damascus. The steep gradients and rack-rail system used between Rayak and Beirout is the great difficulty to through transport to Beirout by this route. The natural seaport of Aleppo is Alexandretta, connected by a good ' Chaussee.' The Imperial Ottoman Bank has a branch in Alleppo, and there are Consuls for Great Britain, Germany, France, Russia, Austria, and Italy. There are some fair hotels and shops for European goods. Aleppo is an important telegraph centre. There is a line to Bagdad down the Euphrates Valley, and one to Constantinople by Alexandrctta and Adana. A line runs south to Damascus, and there is connection with Cyprus by cable from Latakia. Also a line to Diarbekr by Birijik, and another to Marash and Albistan. 7. Birijik. Birijik is an important town on the left bank of the Euphrates at the crossing of the principal trade route from Diarbekr to Aleppo and Alexan- dretta. It is built on the slopes of a ravine in a whitish limestone cliff above the river, is surrounded by an ancient wall, and contains a ruined strong hold which defended the passage of the river which has been crossed here from the earliest times. It contains some 10,000 inhabitants, mixed Turk, Arab, and Kurd, with some Armenians and Jews, and is the principal trade centre of these districts for cereals, butter, olive oil, and grapes. Water plentiful from a spring above the town. Southwards along the river for some 90 miles is a fertile belt of land producing without irrigation wheat and barley, containing scattered mud villages, and extending on both banks of the river for some 5 miles. Passage of the ^Euphrates. • &lt; r i ver at ordinary level is 300 yards wide, and 8 to 10 feet deep with a fairly strong current. In flood seasons it becomes 600 yards wide! The approaches on the left bank are much steeper than those on the rio-ht* At present the crossing's made in thirteen ferry-boats of rough wooden cons truction. At Khalfati, some 18 miles upstream, the river is 200 vards wide and 25 feet deep with a current of about 3 miles an hour, between steep cliffs of white limestone. * L ' Dl ' vvccu 8. Killis. ^ 2 ' 0 J 80 f ® et ) is a P lace of 12,000 inhabitants, of whom the majority aie lui-ks, and 4,000 Armenians. Houses of stone, flat-roofed fruits'' ™. 1R - Vards and gardens famous for their olives and v « y f ® rtlle P ,am extends north-west to Aintab. The place itself Inrkish, with a large Armenian quarter to the north-east, and a quarter containing Arabs and Circassians on the other side. Good water from wells and springs in the hills behind the town. 9. Aintab, Aintab (altitude, 3,600 feet), the seat of a Kaimakan under Alepno is a of i 'very fertile ^ tW0 - St0ried h0USes ia the11 The population is about 40,000, of whom half are Christians, including 15,000 Armenians. There is a rich and flourishing Protestant community, with an American mission college and mission hospital. Water from the neighbouring hills through an old aqueduct- Good 'chaussee ' leads to Alexandretta through Killis, and a road to Birijik much used by caravans. Extensive vineyards, pistachio, and olive groves in the vicinity. Country gently undulating towards Birijik, stony ridges, with well- cultivated valleys and several streams. Extensive olive groves at Nisib, about half-way to Birijik. 10. Country between Birijik and Diarhekr. Tha direct route from Birijik to Diarbekr avoids Urfa, and passes north of it through Huvek, and so to Suverek and Diarbekr. After the ascent from the Euphrates Valley at Birijik, a plateau country with low, stony hills is entered, and shortly after undulating cultivated ground, with several large villages deriving water from wells. Country bare, open, and undulating, with mucli cultivation of wheat and barley. Huvek is a large village with good water from a stream. Suverek is a poor place of 5,000 inhabitants, Kurds and Armenians,'among vineyards, with water from springs. Beyond Suverek, a gently undulating country wiih deep heavy soil, mostly untilled, but growing good grass in spring. The northern slopes of the Karaja Dagh are easy, and present no difficulties to the road. Hills are here strewn with volcanic boulders; the country is undulating, with fertile though stony soil; several villages deriving water from springs and streams. A stony plain, but with heavy fertile soil, extends for the last 25 miles before Diarbekr is reached. The Urfa Plain opens southwards into that of Harran; is very fertile, with numerous villages and fairly well cultivated, although the advent of a railway would induce increased production. The district of Seruj (between Urfa and Birijik) is also a fertile one, with many villages. Inhabitants, Kurds, part settled and part nomad. 11. Vrfa. Urfa, the ancient Edessa, is the seat of a Mutessarif under Aleppo, with a population numbering 20,000, of whom 7,500 are Armenians, with about 4,000 Syrians, Jacobite Christians, and Jews. In the villages of the Urfa Plain, including the city, is a population of some 30,000 Armenians. There is a large Protestant community with an American mission in the town. The town is built on two rocky hills, one crowned by a ruinous citadel, and the ancient walls still partly surround the place. A large spring supplies the town with water, and many small springs exist in the plain and are utilized for irrigation. Euel is very scarce and expensive. The district route from Birijik to Urfa for a railway is to be avoided because of the steep descent among rocky hills into the Urfa Plain. The German trace of the Bagdad line avoids this by crossing the Euphrates at Jerablus below Birijik, and passing through Harran in the plain 25 miles south of Urfa.' A branch is proposed from Harran up to Urfa. The northern trace, going from Birijik to Diarbekr, would pass through Huvek, from which a short branch could be constructed to Urfa. 12. Harran. Harran, although standing amongst extensive ruins, is now only a small village of mud huts, a few tents, a ruined castle, and a mosque. The population are half Arab and half Kurd. 13. Veranshehr. Veranshehr is a small town of 700 houses, of which 100 are Christians. Good water from springs and wells. The place is built among ruins of an older12 site and inhabited by Kurds, a few Circassians and Syrians, Christians, and Armenians, who are traders and own all the stalls in the bazaar. It is the head-quarters in winter of Ibrahim Pasha, the powerful Chief of the Milli Kurds. He adopts a policy of inducing Armenians and men of his tribe to settle on the vacant lands round Veranshehr, and is not hostile to Christians. Between Veranshehr and Eas-ul-Ain is a dreary waste of uncultivated land with few visible signs of life, and an intensely hot summer climate with a scarcity of water at that season. 14. Bas-ul-Ain. Eas-ul-Ain is a very small place among extensive ruins, close to the sources of the Khabur, which rises here from a large lukewarm spring in a grove of poplars. The inhabitants are, with few exceptions, Circassians who arrived here forty years ago, some 9,000 strong, to found a colony, but the country was disturbed, and constant warfare with their neighbours has thinned their numbers until only about ninety fafniles remain. Many have migrated from here to Deir-ez-Zor and Bagdad. The whole of the broad Valley of the Khabur, containing numerous ancient ruins, remains depopulated, and with very little cultivation. 15. Samsat. Samsat is an important passage of the Euphrates for roads leading from Urfa to the districts north of the river about Behesne and Adiaman. It was once a celebrated city, the ruins of which are attested by a large artificial mourd on the right bank of the river, but the modern village contains only about 100 houses peopled by Kurds and Turkomans, with an occasional Osmanli and Armenian. With the advent of a railway passing through Huvek on the way from Birijik to Diarbekr, this ferry of the Euphrates would rogain much of its former importance, and the trade of the fertile districts of Behesne, Adiaman, and Kialihta would cross here to join the railway at Huvek. 16. Mar ash. Marash is a thriving town of 40,000 inhabitans, a third of whom are Armenians, and the seat of a Mutessarif under Aleppo. It is situated at the foot of some steep outliers of the Taurus, and overlooks a wide, well-watered plain to the south. It is a prosperous town, and the plain is well cultivated with corn and rice, while near the town are vineyards and fruit gardens, whiie the hills to the north afford excellent pasturage for sheep. The summer climate is rather unhealthy, owing to extensive rice-growing on the plain ; but the high-lying quarter of the town is healthy, and admirably supplied with water from springs. A good road leads to Aintab and through there to Aleppo and Alexandretta. Other communications through the northern hills and to the west are difficult tracks. 17. Diarbekr. Diarbekr is an important commercial centre on a steep bluff overlookino' the right bank of the Upper Tigris. It contains some 38,000 inhabitants, nearly half being Christian (Armenians, Jacobites, Chaldeans, and Greek), with the remainder Turks, Kurds and Turkomans. In it was Amida » an important forntier post, and is still additions 0 ^ thick masomy walls built at that period, with subsequent Emit gardens, which produce wonderfully in this volcanic soil, line the slope down to the river.13 Water supply plentiful and fairly good from springs and an aqueduct. The plain to the north, extending nearly up to Argliana on the Kharput road, is fertile growiug good corn crops, dotted with villages, and has several 8 treanis. At Argbana Maden are copper-mines, which are known to be of the most productive nature, with remarkably pure ore. They are of considerable extent and the mineral area extends also to Piran and some places north-east, At present, for want of wood fuel, there is a considerable difficulty in smeltino- on the spot, and the ore is taken to Tokat, several days' journey. The richest corn-producing district is that east of Diarbekr, in the wide area between the foot of the Sassun Mountains and the Tigris. This undulat ing plain country has many large streams, is extremely fertile, and produces cereals and cotton for export. The ruins of the large cities of Tigranocerta and Kharzan are in this district. Biarbekr is a very important route centre whence 'chaussees' radiate to Alexandretta, Kharput, and Mardin, with caravan roads to JBitlis. Sairt and Mosul through Jezire. The place is also an important telegraph centre. There are Consuls for Great Britain and France. 18. Mardin. Mardin is the seat of a Mutessarif under Diabekr, built on the south side ot a prominent conical hill crowned by an ancient citadel, and commanding an extensive view over the plain to the south. It has a population of 27,000, of whom half are Christians of the Armenian, Chaldean, Jacobite, and Protestant communities, and the remainder Kurds and Arabs. The streets are very steep, generally paved in steps, with a few good two- storied houses ; but the bazaars are poor for the size of the town. The climate is dry and healthy. Water from springs, which sometimes fail in summer. Mardin is the chief contre of Jacobite Christians of the Tor Abdin Hills close by, and Deiv Zaferan Monastery close by is the residence of their ratnarch. It is an important American mission station. fertile* 16 ^ Ab(iin tll0u o l1 stony, grow vines well, and the valleys are 19.

Some years age nnPl was laken from here by the Turks to work their Tigris steamers below Bagdad; but as the coal had to be floated down on skin rafts to Bagdad, and the methods of working were very primitive, ^ ^pver been properly examined as to the extent or the coal area- Other coal seams appear on the surface at Amada, near Akra, a long way o the south -east, and possibly a continuous coal field may be found between these two points. ^ -r • 1 i The plain along the foot of the Judi Dagh, from Zakho up to Jezire, has exceptionally rich soil, and grows excellent maize and cotton, besides wheat and rice. t Harbol is a large Christian village, picturesquely situated m a gorge in the hills. Every available patch round it is cultivated with vines, corn, and r ice. ^ 22. Jezire-ibn-Omctr. Jezire -ibn-Omar is on a low-lying plain adjoining tbe_ right bank of the Tigris where the river emerges from some deep gorges in the Kurdish nills, and is chiefly important as the crossing place of the Mosul-Diarbekr caravan road. It stands on the ruins of the Eoman frontier fortress of Bezabde, which then covered the place of crossing. A bridge of boats is used now, but the ruins of a masonry bridge exist a few miles down. There are 7,500 inhabitants of Kurds, of which 500 are Chaldean Christians. In the spring it is the crossing-place for the nomad Kurdis tribes, who winter on the plains west of the Tigris, and then wish to cross over to the up land pastures south of Lake Van. At that time it is a considerable market for wool and other produce of the tribes^ which is floated down to Mosul and Bagdad on rafts of inflated skins. The river channel is here 150 yards wide and 15 feet deep in June, but in flood it covers a width of 400 yards. There is a Kaiwakam under Mosul. 23. Mosul. Mosul is the principal town in Upper Mesopotamia and capital of vilayet of the same name, situated on the right bank of the Tigris, opposite the rums of Nineveh. It was formerly one of the principal stages on the trade route from east to west, and the large towns of Nineveh and Nimrod close by derived much of their importance from this. It is still a great meeting-point of caravan routes from Bagdad, ^ est Persia, Bidlis, and Diarbekr; besides being the centre of very productive districts on the far bank of the river up to the foot of the Kurkish hills. Population 40,000, mostly Arab and Kurd races, with about 7,000 Christians (Chaldeans, Catholic Syrians, Jacobites) and some Jews. There are French and German Consuls, and a British Consular Agent. Houses of stone set in gypsum, the larger houses often built round a courtyard./r: 15 Wa+pv frnm the Tigris and from rather brackish wells.

Erbil, the ancient Arbela, is a place of about 15,000 inhabitants, mostly Kurds, the houses crowded together on an earthen mound rising 200 feet out of the level plain. It is the seat of Kaimakam, and an important point on the Bagdad-Mosul caravan route. Tracks lead eastward to Eowanduz to North-West Persia, and through Keni Sanjak to Wazna Pass. Water from wells and underground water channels karez '); soil, gravelly loam. The surrounding district, with that of Shemamlik, has several villages, and grows corn and some rice. Fruit and grapes are brought from the hill districts of the Sefin Dagh, one day to the east. 29. Passage of the Great Zah River between Mosul and Erhil. Average width of channel at the ordinary season is 120 to 150 yards, 10 feet deep, with a strong current over gravel and shingle at Kalek, where 'the Mosul-Erbil road crosses. ^ An extent of 600 to 700 yards of shingle is covered at the flood season in spring. 30. Altun Keupri and Passage of the Lesser Zab River. Altun Keupri is a place of 600 houses (about 3,000 inhabitants), crowded together on an island J-mile long, in the Lesser Zab Riyer. Inhabitants are chiefly Kurds, with some Arabs. The main river channel is on the south, and just here passes through a short gorge with conglomerate cliffs spanned by an old masonry bridge of ona 60-feet arch, so that a railway bridge here would be easy to construct. The northern channel round the island is often dry, and is some 30 yards wide in flood. J 31. Tekrit. , , T&lt; i k ? t '.

J. C. P. Hotz &amp; Co., London ; Messrs. David Sassoon &amp; Co., London, Bombay, and Calcutta ; with a German firm of Beck, Putman, &amp; Co. There is a branch of the Imperial Ottoman Bank. There is a Consul-General for Great Britain, and Consuls for the other Powers. Wheat, barley, wool, and dates are the staple produce of the Mesopota- mian Plain. Corn is sown in November or December and harvested in May or June, An autumn crop of maize, harvested about December, is of tea raised, too. Large herds of sheep, cattle, buffaloes are to be found, with camels, mules and donkeys for transport. Prom October to May the climate is cool and invigorating ; from July to the middle of September it is opprtssively hot. The average width of the river is 250 yards wide, and in flood 30 to 86 feet deep, aud is crossed by two boat bridges. The river route from Bussorah brings all trade to Bagdad from the south, and the main road through Khanikiu to Kermanshah leads into P ersia, and that by Kirkuk and Erbil to Mosul, These are the principal routes, aud there are others along the Euphrates Valley to Aleppo and Damascus and by the Tigris right bank to Bagdad, and also direct to Suleimanie. Towns on the .Euphrates. 35. Museyib. Museyib is an important'crossing, with boat bridge'of the Bagdad-Kerbela road over ; the Euphrates. There are 1,000 houses, mostly on the ileft bank, and a large covered bazaar, with a floating population of about 11,500 more, mostly Shia Arabs, with many Persians. 36. Kefhela, Kerbela is on the plain, 20 miles west of the Euphrates, connected with it by the Husseinic Canal, which is also the water supply of the town. It contains 5,000 well-built houses, among date groves and gardens, among which the houses are often hidden. Population 60,000, mostly Arabs and Persians, with many Indian Moslems. There is a Vice-Consul for Great Britain. The Mosque of Hussein, also his burial place, is a jpeculiar object of veneration for all Shia Moslems, and thus the place is an important Persian religious centre and place of pilgrimage. It is also the centre of a busy agricultural district, and has a well-stocked and busy bazaar. 37. ttejef. Nejef has a population of 12,000, among whom are many Indian Moslems ; contains a mosque with the shrine of Ali, and forms, with dlerbela, one of the Shia'jalaces of great sanctity, to which pilgrimages are made and bodies taken from Persia for burial. It is also a centre for the Beni Hassan Arabs. Water rather scarce from wells, but the best is obtainable from the Hindie Canal, 4 miles off. 38, Hilla, Hilla is the chief town of a kaza under Diwanie; has a population, include ing the gardens, of some 30,000, and stands amid extensive date gardens on both banks. There is a boat bridge. It is an important military centre from which to control the Ardb tfibes,18 The river cliannel is usually dry now, except in flood, owing to mi.-, management of the Museyib barrage, which has forced all the Euphrates waW down the Hindie Channel. ^ This is having a serious effect on the date gardens and prosperity of this part of the country. 39, Diwanie. Diwanie stands on hoth banks of the B uphrate?, but mostly on the east, among a small extent of date gardens. _ * It has a Mutessarif under Bagdad, and is looked on as an important centre from which to control the Arabs of the Lower Euphrates t 40. Rnmetha. Rumetha is a thriving town of about BOO houses, mostly on the right bank of the Euphrates, amid a considerable extent of date gardens. Is an important trade centre for this part of the country, trading in wheat and rice, with a good bazaar. The river channel here often narrows to only 30 or 40 feet, owing to water having been directed into the Hindie Canal. 41 Samawa. Samawa is principally on the right bank of the Euphrates, with a good bazaar, and forms a special centre for the corn trade. The southern bank is lined with extensive date gardens. It is one of the principal towns frequented by the powerful Arab tribe of Muntifik, who cover the country to the south under the leadership of Sadun Pasha, who is often at variance or even open hostility with the Government. 42. Nasrie, Na^rie is a comparatively modern town and military station, specially meant to overawe the Muntafik tribe to the south. It stands on the north or left bank of the river, and is the seat of a Mutessarif. Several date gardens on the right bank lower down. 43. JBussorah, The actual town lies 2 miles from the Shatt-ul-Arab River on a canal, is within ruinous walls, a nd. contains 18,000 inhabitants; but, with suburbs, the total population is about 40,000, mostly of Arabs, with 3,000 Persians, 1,000 Jews, and 100 Christians of various sects. Eew Turks, besides Govern ment officials. The Consulates and European warehouses are along the right bank of the Shatt-ul-Arab. Drinking water is from the river, and is not good. Steamers able to cro^s the bar at the mouth of the Shattcan ascend easily, to Bussorah (67 miles from the sea^, and vessels of light draft (small gun boats) can ascend to Kurna. The steamers anchor in midstream, and all cargo is discharged into lighters. River steamers ascend the Tigris River to Bagdad, but cannot navigate the Euphrates owing to shoal water in the marshes, about 50 miles above Kurna. Native sailing boats manage to cross this obstruction, and by means of these river traffic is maintained with Samawa and the towns on the Lower Euphrates. Bussorah is famous for its date gardens, which line both banks of thq river from Kurna to the sea. Corn and rice is also exported. There are British and other Consulates. 44, Zobeir. Zobeir is a small Arab town of 2,000 inhabitants in the desert, 10 miles west of Bussorah. Near it is a large spring of good water, and around is a considerable extent of well-cultivated grouud.19 45. Vmfcasr. Umkasr consists solely of two mud forts, one an old one now nearly in ruins, occasionally occupied by Koweit Arabs, and a newer Turkish for some 30 yards square and of little strength, usually containing a small Turkish gariison. {Beceivedy on 18th March 1907, with letter from Secretary, Political Depart, ment, India Office, No. 9, dated let March 1907.)

The negotiationsare, as you are aware, being carried on at present between the Civil List ana Messrs.

Mr. Nichols is now instructed by Mr. d'Arcy to ask whether he wo aid have tlie support, of His Majesty's Embassy in securing the return of the calltioa money should the case arise. I have told Wim that if his contract is made with a responsible Department of the Ottoman Government, he would certainly have the Support always given by this Embassy to British subjects endeavouring to secure their rights. I venture to point out that there is every ground for believing that this Concession, especially as Mesopotamia is developed by the extension of railway communications and irrigation works, will prove exceedingly valuable, and, as I observed in my earlier despatch, the creation of such important British interests in that country will greatly enhance our influence and general position. This being so, you may think it perhaps desirable to speak of the matter to some of the gentlemen who are connected with the Burma Company. I have, etc., N. E.

Mohammerah, Persia, and the Persian Gulf. The following points occur to me „ ® x P or by sea and, in a lesser degree, imports by ^ ' 1 f&lt; rS n ^turea of Turkish Arabian trade. British Bussorah is chieBly concerned with exports, while Bagdad, where21 British firms are mainly engaged m the import trade, is the priaeipal centre f or the distribution of cotton piece goods, its commercial influence extending to Mosul and Aleppo, Kurdistan and Western Persia. Bagdad has a decided mercantile predominance over Bussorah, which apart from the date and ^rain export trade, is merely the ocean port of Bagdad. Ocean traffic ceases at Bussorah, and ri^r trafflc ceases to be protitable above Bagdad. All commerce to the ea^t, north, and west of Bagdad is conducted by caravan The value of imports by sea to Bussorah, including Hagdad, which was approximately 511,000/. in 1887, rose in 1905 to 1,387,000/., showing an increase of nearly 1,0 &gt;0,000/. in eighteen years. The value of exports during the same period increased from 97^,000/. to 1,515,000/., or about 600 000/ Of 102 steamers cleared at the port of Bussorah in 1888, 101 were British with an aggregate tonnage of 103,296 tons. Of 169 cleared in 1905 163 were British, with au aggregate tounage of 182,180 tons. British commercial interests in lurkish Arabia predominate over those of every other European country, and are as follows :— 1. 96 per cent, of the shipping of the port of Bussorah. 2. A very large proportion of the export trade, which is carried either direct to the United Kingdom or to other countries in British ships. 3. About 60 per cent, of the imports, consisting chiefly of British, Indian and Colonial manufactured goods and products. 4. The annual pilgrimage of British subjects and British protected subiects to the Snia shrines. The number of passengers from India and Europe chiefly pilgrims, who passed through the Lazaretto in 1905 was 11,535. 5. About one-fourth of the river transport from Bussorah to Bagdad and vice-versa, as represented by the two steamers of the Tigris and Euphrates Steam Navigation Company (agents Messrs. Lynch Brothers). . In Yiew . Present disabilities, such as the bar difficulty, the impediments to river navigation and what is practically a Turkish river monopolv British import trade both to the internal towns of Turkey and in transit to Persia would I think, if assured of commercial fair play, benefit by the Bagdad Railwav and expand, whether we participate in its construction or not. But as tlie line starts from Constantinople, and connects there with the Central and Eastern European railway systems, it will undoubtedly favour the trade of Eastern and Central Europe, and react to our prejudice in those directions. To enable us therefore, to hold our own with advantage against the competition of land' borne traffic, we require increased facilities for our water-borne trade such aq the removal or mitigation of some of the disabilities which now hamper it If this were dore the Bagdad Railway would, I think, to some extent, benefit our trade inland from the Persian Gulf and aid its development. A terminus accessible to ocean steamers, would remove the congestion, which occurs annually when the river falls, and obviate the obstruction of the bar at the estuary of Shatt-ul-Arab, which now strangles our trade at the neck The line would of course serve to develop new areas of cultivation, and our water- borne trade, now artificially cramped and confined, would, unless repulsed bv some undue preferential treatment of our rivals, or otherwise interfered with take its share of the returning prosperity of the country. Composition between the rail and river transport would undoubtedly have the effect of lowerino- freight rates from Bussorah to Bagdad and vice-versa, which are now exorbitant' but as the German Company by Article 9 of their Concession obtains^ navigat ing rights on the river during the construction of the line, it seems improbablp that, after acquiring the necessary plant and establishing wharves anrl warehouses at Bagdad and Bussorah, it willrelinquish entirely the advanta^ps of navigation. It may thus acquire complete control of the traffic bv water^as well as by land, and in that case the present British interest in the carrvin- trade ot the river, which does not exceed one-fourth of the whole would no? appear to have much prospect of further development. t, x ^he Germans no doubt calculate, not only that new trade will be developed but tliat the course of present trade will be altered. It is expected that ^ \ es w ceas e to be the chief medium between Europe and the East and that passenger traffic with India will be almost absorbed by the Bagdad22 terminus at any one of thcs 0 poin^ 8 con trol the railways, not from Bombay. The l! a P lla ' i )ut a i B o of Svria and Northern Arabia, only of Asia Minor and Mcsopotaraia. bu a Aleppo, will no doubt and the Syrian rail .ay system^now oompleted nB f W ith and that these, enooura^t d by p nrmppfion Clause 29 of the Conces- iS^tbe opening of the Persian Gulf sum has a f nl *' p r J' , line from Konia to Bagdad is oien and working. The^rigMs conferred on the Company by other Articles of the Concession are of a nalure to assure it a monopoly of the economic g jti h interest! through -Which the line passes, and it is not improbable that Bntish interests will be excluded from participating in the profits of any sucb development. As regards the export trade of the districts under consideration which consists nrincipaliy of cereals, dates, horses, liquorice, wool, hides, oiium, eall-nuts etc., I do not see tint our interests are likely to be seriously a'h'cted bv the railway. Grain cnUivattd in regions adjacent to toe ligns and Ennhrates. which are situated at a considerable distance Irom the pioposed alignment'of the railway, will continue to find its way dowo the river to Bussorab where it is shipped in hulk with comparatively little trouble. Dates grown in gardens on tlie river banks are packed on the spof, and placed on hoard steamers moored opposite the gardens which entails a nummum of time and labour, these require no railway to f ; ,clll ^ a \ ,he1 ';, tiade of Bagdad and the surrounding country will benefit by the facih.ies of th7railway transport, and will no doubt travel direct o the Gulf terminus for shipment to India at less cost than hitherto. Wool, which is now sent from Amara and Suk-es-Sbiyukh to Bagdad for pressing previous to being exported to Europe will be transported by rail. Now areas of cultivation, opened under the auspices of the railway, will naturally benefit by it, and the price of cereals may fall in consequence, which will be to the general advantage. But, commercial considerations apart, the Bagdad Eailway has a purely political bearing which deserves examination. British interests in the sc'neme centre in the Mesopotamian delta, and tbose interests, political as well as commercial, date back as far as 1689, when an English factory was first established at Bussorah. If the line is built entirely without British participation our political standing and ascendency, which have been undisputed and predominant over those of every other foreign nation for more than two and a-half centuries, will be eclipsed and must disappear, and a legitimate field of political and commercial development will be definitely closed against us f Commercial interests gradually assume political importance in weak States, and the Power which controls the railway will also control the country by reason of the very nature of the enterprise which will require adequate protection if the line of communication is to be kept open. German military police will be as indispensable for the protection of the line in Mesopotamia as Cossacks were for the Mauchurian Hailuay. The country is now without a Government in any reasonable sense of the term. The authority of the Turk is limited to a few towns and their immediate neighbourhood, and the Arab tribes are in a chrpnic state of revolt. The Kurds and Hamidieh cavalry regiments harry the population, Christian and Mussulman alike, with impunity in Northern Mesopotamia, and Mustapha Pasha is said to have established a reign of terror from Diarbekr to Mosul. On the Bagdad-Nedjef Zobeir sections of the railway the Montifik Arabs hold the key of the situation and will have to be considered. The civilizing influence of the railway must help to restore some measure of order and security in these places, where Turkish misgovernment does nothing but exasperate a semi-barbarous people, and encourages lawlessness by breaking faith with Arab tribesmen and subjecting them to the caprice and exactions of irresponsible and corrupt officials. German influence will permeate these regions, and, stimulated by23 the chenpness of German manufactures, a current of feeling may set in hostile, if not directly antagonistic, to British interest. Tiie&gt;e would, perhaps, be best served if we undertook the task of making some portion of the railway ourselves, and if we controlled and managed the southern sec ions of the line from Bagdad to Bussorah and the Persian Gulf, as well as the bianch line to Khanikin on the Persian frontier. The other points mentioned are beyond my province, and I feel very incompetent to express any opinion on them. Mohammerah and Persia —As regards Mohammerah and Persia, generally the Karun is, of course, the chief base of operations for tne future develop ment of trade routes from the South of Persia, whether the line taKen is Shuster Khoremabad and Bunrjird, connecting through Sultanabad with the carriage road between Kum and Tehran, or whether traffic follows the Lynch road across the Bakhtiari Mountains to Isfahan. The difficulties attending animal transport in Persia are only too well known, and although the Ahwaz-Isfahan route is 253 miles shorter than that from Bushire to Isfahan, the road in either case crosses mountains of great altitude, and there are always the same road obsracles for heavily loaded mules. Under these circumstances it seems probable that the opening of the Bagdad Hallway with a terminus on the Persian Gulf, and a branch line from Bagdad to Khanikin, will cause a deflection in sea-borne imports from the Karun route to that via Bagdad and Khanikin, where they will have easier and more rapid access to the northern and central Persian market^ As the line will be connected with Eastern and Central Europe, Khanikin will be brought into touch with other centres of trade, and the result may well be that Isfahan and Northern Persia will ultimately be supplied with continental goods at less cost than that at which sea-borne British goods are now imported. In other words, the Bagdad Railway may close the Karum route for foreign imports, in so far as Northern and Central Persia are concerned. Anything which tends to emancipate trade from the intense conservatism of the Persian muleteer, who now controls the carrying trade of the country, must be to the general advantage, and although a railway as far as Khanikin would not enable us to dispense with mule transport for our imports beyond that point there would be a considerable saving of time and distance, which should to some extent compensate us for the closing of other routes to imported trade. The export of wheat in good seasons was an important^ feature in the estimate of future traffic on the Karun Biver, and I do not think the Bagdad Railway will adversely affect the development of a region which is justly considered capable of becomingr one ot the granaries of Uie world. If the German Company, by virtue of the powers conferred on it by Article '^3 of the Concession, undertakes the dredging of the bar at the estuary of the Shatt- ul -Arab, which I fear is not likely, the grain export trade of the Karun will derive considerable benefit from the operation. British trade with Persia by the Khanikin route, which is now estimated roushly at three-quarters of a million, would surely benefit by the construction of the railway, unless, indeed, our trade were subjected to differential treatment which it should be in our power to prevent. The Khanikin branch will collect the great passenger traffic of the Shiite pilgrims who visit the sacred shrines at Kerbela and Nedjef. Fersian Gulf—In the Persian Gulf the following points appear to me to affect British interests :— (a) The choice of a terminus. (b) The transmission of mails to India by the Bagdad Railway, (c) The potential dangers in a trans* continental highway towards India. (d) The stipulation in the Concession regarding the delay in constructing the Gulf section until the Constantinople-Bagdad sections are completed, which operates clearly in restraint of British trade. It was stated in 1902 that 'we sought no material advantages for ourselves in the Persian Gulf, beyond those which British trade and shipping could reap from the freedom and security of commerce and navigation in open competition ^ith the rest of the world,' 5351 F. D, I24 The advantages of our position enabled us to make this assumption, but it is an open question whether we shall hold the same view when the Bagdad Railway reaches its terminus on the Gulf. The German fleet will then have been doubled, and we shall be face to face with a great military and naval Power, advantageously based on a railway ten days from Berlin and four from Bombay. Commercially we may have to compete with a German coastin** service, drawing coal and supplies from the railway terminus, and able, throuo-h preferential treatment for German land-borne manufactures, to displace us^n the Gulf markets. Our interests, political and commercial alike, render unwise the surrender of our pre-eminence in the Persian Gulf. The maximum gain that can be shown in favour of the Bagdad route for Indian mails appears to be one day and sixteen hours, which may be still further reduced by accelerating our own steatn-ship service. Taking into consi deration the risks the mails would run through Turkey on a trans -continental line in the control and management of which we do not participate, the com pensatory advantages seem small. As regards the terminus, Koweit appears to me to be the most suitable spot as being withm our sphere of influence, though how long we shall conti- nue to enjoy our ascendency there when rt has become the outlet for the Rail way I am at a loss to conjecture. Umm-Kasr seems to me too land-locked Bussorah would make the best commercial terminus, but the bar would have o be dredged, and Warba island seems to offer the greatest engineering facilities There is no doubt that the construction of the line from the Gulf should be undertaken concurrently with that of the other sections. Any other course is prejudicial to our commercial and political interests. I have, etc., P. E. CEO W.

And all-German line, with its terminus in t -i some point on the Khor Abdullah or Khor ZoL ^wWl' Say, ** prepared to recognize as Turkish territory We are 3. An all-German line with its terminus at Bussorah. 4. An all-German line ending at Bagdad.25 . I will discuss them briefly in the above order— (1) I devoutly hope that (1) may be eliminated from serious consideration and that, in view of our understanding with Sheikh Mubarek, His Majesty's Government would not tolerate it urder any circumstances. It would be by far the most damaging solution for us, both commercially, strategically, and politically. Prom the commercial standpoint, we should have a great increase in the foreign steamer traffic, and probably a specific State-aided campaign by Germany directed against our predominant position as carriers of sea -borne trade to these waters. r lheir steamers would come for dates, as at present, and for grain, if the hinterland of Koweit were irrigated for cultivation, as it probably will be. They would bring cargoes of German produce for distribution up the line from this end. Strategically, we should have a potential naval ba y e and supply depot, fed by a railway controlled by a rival naval Power, within 1,200 miles of Karachi, and we should have German men-of-war cruising about the Gulf ' fishing in troubled waters.' Politically, we should suffer immensely in prestige and in regard to our present predominant influence among the maritime Arabs as ' keepers of the peace by sea.' For the last eighty years or more we have been a tradition with them all, and almost a fetish with many. Lastly, I have no doubt that the pearl fisheries, the preservation of which to the Arabs has been the corner stone of our policy and influence, would be invaded by the European element with their scientific appliances. (2) The commercial and stategical disadvantages in this case seem much the same. The political damage which we stood to suffer might be balanced to some extent if we took the unlikely course of occupying Koweit and Bahrein as Protectorates. (3) This alternative would be much less damaging to us strategically and politically, but equally detrimental to us commercially. The Railway Com pany, possibly with secret State aid, would presumably make it their business to cut freights between Bussorah and Pagdad so as to be able to compete with the river-borne traffic. They would also endeavour to oust British-Indian goods from the promising market w hich now exists for it via Khanikin and Kermanshah, Their operations would also prejudice the development of the Earun route, especially the prospective artery via Dizful and Khoremabad. ^ In all the foregoing cases (1, 2 and 3) the Germans would certainly use their convenient position and increasing knowledge of this region to encourage the Porte to encroach and extend their influence in Nejd and on the Arab coast, greatly to our detriment. The line will in any case possibly be linked up with the Damascus-Mecca line or with Medina or Mecca direct, and they will be in a favourable position for securing the control of that line when the time comes and of the pilgrim traffic with it. (4) This is the alternative that I should like personally to see. It would no doubt be used to oust us as far as possible from the South-West Persian market above referred to ; at the same time, unless British-Indian goods were penalized, some compensation for the competition experienced on the Khanikin- Kermanshah line might be found in the throwing open of Mesopotamia to commerce generally, in which British-Indian goods might find a place. In this case German influence could not conveniently come far enough south to enable her to encourage Turkey much in the direction of expansion in Central Arabia. I have not had the time I should like to have had to think out all these issues very searchinglj, but I hope they will be sufficient to show you what my ideas othe subject generally are.

Yours sincerely, W. McDOUALL. Inclosure 4 in No. 1 Major Ramsay to Mr. G. Barclay. R.I.M.S. ' Comet,' January 9, 1907. (Confidential.) Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Secret telegram, dated the 3rd (4th) January, asking for my observations as to the effect that the Bagdad Railway is likely to have on British interest if completed without British participation. 2. As regards the Political interests of the British nation, I can add nothing to the remarks contained in the letter which I addressed to His Excellency the Ambassador a few months ago. 3. As regards the commercial interests of great Britain, I think that these are likely to be forwarded by a railway from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf, because such a railway must tend to develop the country and to reduce freights from the port on the Gulf to Bagdad, and to Khanikin on the Persian frontier. 4. Putting aside all political considerations, it appears to me desirable that we should take part in the railway for the following reasons : — (1) If we do not take part, it is not likely that any of the plant required for the construction and up-keep of the Railway will be bought in England. (2) It is not likely that any Englishman will be employed. (3) The office of every foreign official will be a centre from which the interests of foreign trade can, and probably will, be pushed. This argument applies not only to the export and import trade, but especially to the advantages that will accure to the foreign ers in obtaining opportunities of controlling local industries. For example, British machinery would find it 'very difficult to compete with German machinery if German mechanics were the experts who could most conveniently be consulted. I cannot help thinking that Mesopotamia will offer a great opening for agricultural machinery as the country develops. (4) Without British participation it would be difficult, if not impossible, to guard against preference being given to trade from the north. Plausible excuses could no doubt be found by an astute and hostile Railway Manager for charging higher rates on the Southern sections of the line; and even if the rates per mile were uniform throughout the length of the line, the southern trade could be hampered by heavy landing and port charges by want of storing conveniences, and by a rule insisting on all documents being in German and Turkish.27 (5). It appears to me essential to British commercial interests that (1) the railway should be contiDued from Bagdad to Khanikio, so that our trade may compete on favourable terms with the Russian trade in the north-west of Persia, which is the chief market for goods imported into Bagdad, and (2) that either the railway should be continued from Bagdad to the Persian Gulf, or that the Tigris and Euphrates should be open commercial routes. With the railway opened as far as Bagdad only, and the river traffic a monopoly (for Lynch's steamers can carry only a frac tion of the present trade), we might find ourselves in the awkward position that it would cost more to transport goods by sea to Bussorah, and thence to Bagdad, than to import them to Bagdad by rail. Should such a state of affairs exist, our trade from the south would be materially hampered, and any diminution of trade with Bussorah, or the port which replaces it, would probably have a bad effect on our carrying trade in the Persian Gulf generally—ships with cargo for the Persian Gulf ports might find it difficult to get full loads, if the trade with Mesopotamia was reduced. Any obstacles in the way of trade from the south would most seriously affect Indian trade, which could take no advantage of improved means of communication from the north. If the railway is made without British participation, the extensions to the south and east of Bagdad may long remain uncompleted, and it is only these portions of the line which will serve British interests. 5. Briefly stated, my opinion is that the political effect of a railway made without British participation will be fatal to British interest and influence in Mesopotamia, and that the effect of such a railway on British commercial interests may be very serious unless the Euphrates and Tigris are open to trade with such rates of freight as may be settled by open competition. With the rivers closed, British trade migiit be made to pay under the guise of freight, a considerable share of the guarantee given by the Turkish Government to the Bagdad Railway Company. I have, etc., J. BAMSAY. Inclosure 5 in No. 1. Consul Longworth to Me ,. G. Barclay. Aleppo, 4th January 1907. (No. 4. Confidential.) S ir, In reply to your telegram of yesterday's date, I would submit the following observation on the question as to the effect of the Bagdad Railway on British interests in Egypt and Aden, should it be completed as far as Adana and Aleppo. The construction of the three sections—namely, from Eregli southwards to Adana, eastwards to Tel-Habesh, and south again to Aleppo—w T ould result in linking together the lines made and being made from Constantinople to Mecca. 'Viewed from a general standpoint—political, military and economic— such an attainment, reached by the exertions of whatever Company, would I think be in no way prejudicial to our interests in Anatolia or Syria, Arabia or Egypt. The more these regions are open to facilities of communication and inter course the more are we likely to gain popularity with the inhabitants and influence with the authorities. 5351 f. d.28 Pilgrims and traders from north, soutli, and east, brought into closer touch, would doubtless make comparisons and draw conclusions, invidious enough, perhaps, on the state of security, order, and prosperity in dominions under British rule and protection. The feelings of the people being on our sidf, we are likely to hnye within the country, even in the event of hostilities, more friends than enemies. A less favourable aspect of the question, as regards mainly Egypt would' however, present itself should the Mediterranean be ever brought into railway connection with the Persian Gulf. A great part of the traffic would then revert to its old route across Mesopotamia, a deviation which would affect not only the Suez Canal as the passage, but Aden as the emporium of the Indo- European trade. It behoves us, therefore, to be on the alert lest such a railway falls into not altogether friendly hands. I would venture to lay in this connec tion the utmost stress on the necessity of Englishmen obtaining, conjointly with Frenchmen, if needs be, such a concession. The most feasible and beneficial project would doubtless be a line from Alexandretta by Aleppo, Meskineh, and Bagdad to Koweit. It would present no great engineering difficulties, and would require no kilometric guarantee. As British subjects I understand were the first applicants for such a railway, Article XII of the Turco-German Convention, granting to the Anatolian Company a preferential claim to construct any branch between Mersina and Tripoli, could, I think, be disputed and set aside as inadmissible.

[February 16.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. No. 1, [5141] Mr, Cartwright to Sir Edward Grey—[Received February 16.) (No. 15.) Munich, February 14, 1907, Sir, In a recent number the ' Morning Post,' published information with regard to the Bagdad Railway, to the effect that there was an immediate pro bability of an international arrangement being arrived at between British, 1 CS8FDFrench, and German financial groups for the construotjon of three sections of this railway, each of which sections would cost 2,250,000/, and be of the length of 100 kilom. These sections would carry the railway as far as Aleppo, an dm time would he continued to Damascus, to coanect with the line to Mecca, ihe TTTiali^h mner moreover, asserted that this matter had foimcd a subject of the German Ambassador held with King Edward in Paris the other day. These assertions of the ' Morning Post ' have not passed unobserved in Germany, and their truth has not been generally accepted. As a sample of the criticism to which these statements of the ' Morning Post have been subject- ed to here, I will draw your attention to an article m to-day s issue or the Munich tc Neueste Nachrichten,' which is communicated from Berlin. This article asserts that the statements made by the English paper, although full of details, and in spite of all their appearance of being well founded, are in reality nothing more than a British ballon d essai to ascertain the feelings in Germany on the subject. If in London official circles they are of the opinion that the Franco-German financiers who have obtained tiie Concession for the construction of the Bagdad Railway are at the end ^ of their resources, they are strangely misinformed. On the other hand, neither the Imperial Government nor the Deutsche Bank have ever made secret of the fact that under reasonable conditions they would welcome the introduction of British capital in the undertaking. It is well known that originally in England the feeling was in favour of participating in the construction of the Bagdad Railway, but the vigorous action of the Jingo press in the matter caused Mr. Balfour's Cabinet to use their influence to restrain British capital from being engaged in this undertaking. Later on, the British press put forward such uncreasonable claims, as, for instance, that the last section of the line, that leadin 0 * to the Persian Gulf, should be absolutely undei Biitish contiol, that no progress was made in tiie direction of internationalizing the railway. The situa tion, therefore, remains as it was, and no diplomatic negotiations are at present being carried on to alter it ; consequently the Eranco-German Syndicate will continue to complete the line by themselves.

Sir, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a very interesting Con fidential Memorandum, accompanied by six Tables of figures, with which Mr. Block has kindly provided me, the tendency of which is to show that the present financial situation of this Empire is in such an unsatisfactory condition that the Government would have absolutely no justification in pledging further revenues for new loans or for the construction of railways. 2I quite agree with Mi'. Block's views as to the financial and administra tive disorganization of Turkey, and also that it wouid be to the advantage of Great Britain as well as of other countries to induce, were it possible to do so, not the Porte, as Mr, Block says, for this would be a relatively easy matter, but the autocratic and despotic Sovereign of the Empire to adopt a sounder finaDcial policy before embarrassing the Exchequer with heavy charges for further kilometric guarantees. I do not, however, think that the four Powers would be likely to agree among themselves to interfere in the internal affairs of Turkey in the direct way which would be necessary in order to attain the object in view, and still less do I think that Germany would be willing to co-operate with them in a matter of which the primary object was to delay the further construction of the Bagdad Eailway, respecting which a definite Agreement has been concluded between the Ottoman and German Governments. The situation would, however, be altered if Germany were to agree before hand with the three other interested Powers to internationalize the railway, which she is not likely to do at this moment, but even then the task suggested by Mr. Block would be so difficult that probably the Powers would prefer to postpone its consideration until a change of regime here brought it more within the range of practical politics, and held out some prospect that their joint endeavours to place the finances of the Empire on a more stable basis would meet with the support and good-will of Turkey herself. I have, &amp;c. N. R. O'CONOll. Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum by Mr. Block. (Confidential.) From the two statements herewith annexed it is evident that there is no improvement in the financial situation of this country which would justify the Government in pledging further revenues for new loans or for the construction of railways. The financial administration is such that the question naturally arises how far it is possible to continue on the present lines without risk. The system followed by the Sultan's Advisers is similar to that of Russia, to which M. Kokovstoff has reecntly called attention—namely, the reckless issue of credits for all sorts of new expenditure without any possible hope of having corresponding resources to meet them, with the result that to meet current expenditure recourse to borrowing is obligatory. I have shown in the first statement how the annual cost of the debt is increasing. The addition to the burden of taxation borne by the people is calculated to accentuate their discontent. There have been signs during the past few years that this burden of taxation, taken together with a corrupt administration, is producing unrest in the provinces, even among Moslems, which may lead on to a political or to a financial crisis. The Public Debt of Turkey is comparatively small in proportion to the latent wealth of the country. But the country is undeveloped, and will remain so under the present regime. The Debt is almost exclusively external and is not productive. Thers is, it is true, a small asset in the newly-constructed rail ways, but these seem at present to be a permanent charge on the revenues of the country. There is no doubt compensation from the increase of land area under cultivation, which has produced a consequent increase of the tithe revenue and the railways, have naturally produced a certain amount of prosperity ; but as long as commerce is obstructed and industrial liberty is interfered with by 34 puerile police measures, and as long as the construction of roads, bridges, tram wars irrigation, and harbour works is neglected, the railways cannot pay their way for a long time to come. Last year, for instance, the season was most propitious, yet the three sections of the Anatolian Railway, which is under excellent management, showed a falling off of £ T. 44,340 in their gross receipts (see Report No. 2). The charges of the Debt, now borne by the population and to be borne by posterity, represent, therefore, practically nothing, ihe loans hare, in fact, been unremunerative. The forced loan for the Greek war and the forced loan for the Hedjaz Railway are equally unproductiye, but, as I haye no reliable figures of these loans or other similar loans, I have not taken them into consideration ; they haye contributed to the drain on the population ; the proceeds cannot bo said to have been well expended. The loans raised by Turkey since 1886 must have diverted wealth from private productive employment to Government expenditure. The improve ment in the economic situation in many parts of the Empire under these adverse circumstances may be regarded as a proof that the country is capable of development, and that the people possess qualities which should enable Turkey to pay her way, were their energies not stifled by oppressive methods of Govern ment But, under existing circumstances, the moment would not appear to be opportune for pledging further revenues for the construction of railways or for raising new loans. The German Government has recently obliged the Porte to reserve the surplus of the revenues ceded to the bondholders lor the continuation of the Bagdad Railway, instead of leaving these surpluses at the disposal of the Government for pressing administrative needs. This is unsound. The Germans are determined to continue the construction of the Bagdad^ Railway, even without assistance from English and French financiers. That is to say that they will oblige the Porte to set aside further revenues for this purpose. The railway is a political scheme as well as a commercial undertaking, and the German Ambassador admits that he intends to proceed alone with the next section. This can be done. But it cannot be denied that it will be a fresh drain on the resources of the country. It is hoped that, by the extension to the sea, the already existing sections will become more remunerative ; this is pro bably correct. *The Germans also look forward to a change of regime when the hindrances to the commercial and industrial development of the country will be removed. It is, therefore, argued that the ultimate benefits will outweigh the present sacrifice that the Treasury will have to make. The existing financial embarrassments of the Porte, however, interfere with the enforcement of necessary reforms. The defective payment of wages and salaries not only contributes largely to defective administration, but produces discontent. Tlie preliminary to the increase of railway communication by means of kilometric guarantees is a sound and productive system of finance, and, if the revenues are to be increased by the good-will of the Powers, as in the case of the new customs duties to be levied on foreign goods, the Porte might, with reason, be asked to accept advice with regard to current expenditure before being allowed to devote further revenues to the construction of railways, which, for the present, cannot be remunerative. It would be wiser to postpone the construction of railways until the Treasury can make both ends meet. A curtailment of reckless and unnecessary expenditure should precede the imposition of any fresh burdens on the country. Pinancial reform is a preliminary to administrative reform. Under a reformed administration the country would be enabled to meet fresh demands upon it. Without financial reform other reforms are almost out of the ques tion. The example of Macedonia is sufficient to demonstrate that reforms in themselves mean money,(V Unless the Porte adopts methods of economy, it is not justified in pledging further revenues either for new loans or for new railways. I venture to think this should be borne in mind in approaching the ques tion of the further construction of the Baghdad Railway. Already the State is squandering the means provided to meet current expenditure essential to carrying out the functions of Government. The mortgaging of fresh revenues will still further divert from its legitimate object the money raised by taxation, and while the taxpayer will continue to suffer from a bad administration, the State must eventually involve itself in financial embarrassments. No. 1. The figures in the accompanying Tables (A), (B), and (C) speak for themselves, but a few words of comment may not be out of place. In may be useful, by way of preface, to recall that at the time of the Decree of Mouharrem the outstanding debt of the Ottoman Empire (including arrears of interest) was £ T. 286,253,000 (excluding loans raised on the Egyptian tribute); it was found necessary to make a large reduction both in the nominal capital of the Debt and the rate of interest payable thereon, and when in 1882 the Council of Administration of the Ottoman Debt was called into existence by the Decree of Mouharrem (8th (20th) December, 1881), the amount of the Debt was reduced to £ T. 125,257,000 in round figures (nominal). Up to 1886 the gross receipts of the revenue ceded to the bondholders by the Decree of Mouharrem represented the charges on the Debt, namely* £ T. 2,222,425, to which must be added the annual payment towards the Russian war indemnity of £ T. 350,000 plus expenses. (See Table (A). The loans raised on the tributes of Egypt and Cyprus are excluded from these calculations.) These together amounted to £ T. 2,573,800, which I have taken as representing the sum that Turkey then paid as the charges on her foreign debt in 1886. According to the best available information, the estimated receipts in the official Budget of the Empire were £ T. 15,257,118 (excluding the Egyptian and Cyprus tributes), and the proportion of the receipts therefore paid by Turkey for the service of her foreign debt in 1886 was 16 86 per cent. In 1896 the position has changed (Table B): four new loans were raised between 1886 and 1896. The charges have therefore increased to £ T. 3,323,296, plus the £ T. 350,000 and expenses of the Russian war indemnity, making a total charge of £ T, 3,674,673. If I add the kilometric guarantees, plus expenses, paid in 1896 to the railways which had sprung into existence since 1886, namely, £ T. 498,274, the total payments by Turkey in 1896 for her foreign debt, her war indemnity, and her railways amounted to £ T. 4,172,947, and as the estimate of the revenue of the Imperial Budget of tbat year was £ T. 17,644,000, the proportion required for the service of her Debt and the railways rises to 23*66 per cent. In 1906 the position is worse. The nominal capital indebtedness amounts to £ T. 87,169,13(£ T. 114,691,137 if the unpaid balance of the Russian war indemnity is added). In the meantime she has borrowed £ T. 35,345,750 fresh capital, and gross charges of the foreign debt (not including the war indemnity) have increased from £ T. 2,222,425 in 1886 to £ T. 4,407,581 in 1906. * But it must be remembered that this is a reduction of nominal capital, and does not represent actual payments made by Turkey to amortize her Debt. By the Decree of Unification, a nominal sum of £ T. 43,179,247 was wiped out by a stroke of the pen. Moreover, altliou^h by the action of the sinking fund a nominril amount of £ T. 27,714,141 was paid off between 1881 and 1903 (date of the unification), the actual sum applied to the extinction of this Debt was only £T. 1^,870,000 iu round figures. 5 C88rDThe total charges are now £ T. 5,567,920, as against £ T. 4,172,9 i n 1898 and £T. 2,573,800 in 1886, including the annual payment of the war indemnity and the kilometric guarantees. (Table (C).) The estimated revenue of 1906 of the Empire being £ T. 20,529,600 (exclusive of the tributes of Egypt and Cyprus), the proportion of the revenue paid for the service of the foreign debt, the war indemnity, and the railway guarantees rises to 27*12 per cent., as against 23-65 per cent, m 189b and i6-86 per cent, in 1886. The following Table will show the situation of the three years : — Year. Eevenuh of Empibk.

That the country has been permanently benefited by the raising of a new loans is very doubtful. On the other hand, the country has undoubtedly profited by the construction of railways, but there is no prospect at present of these railways paying their way without kilometric guarantees. The year 1906 was a most prosperous one in every way, yet the kilometric guarantees (including military transports) only show a decrease of £ T. 3,000 odd on a total of £ T. 74)7,0^0 (see Report 2). I have therefore added these kilometric guarantees to the annual charges. If they are eliminated it will not reduce the proportion of charges to revenue to any appreciable extent. Since 1906 there is a new loan of £ T. 2,750,000, the charges for which amount to £T. 123,750, which is not included in my Table. In spite of the issue of fresh nominal capital since 1886 to the amount of £ T. 35,345,750, or an annual average of £ T. 1,767,287, the Budget does not balance. The necessities of administration are annually increasing, and economy is not, as yet, the financial principle adopted at Constantinople. It would seem that to avoid impending danger the Government should as far as possible without prejudice to its safety reduce its expenses. Borrowing in order to meet current expenses cannot be continued indefinitely. The Public Debt of the country is again, as in 1875, assuming considerable proportions. It is time that the attention of all those interested in Turkey's credit and stability should be called to the figures in the accompanying Tables (A), (B) and (C). It may be argued that I have taken as a basis of my calculation the gross and not the net figures of the charges of the foreign debt and the railway * Taking the population of the Empire at 20,000,0(0, the Debt per head of population is to-day £ T. 2'86 or 2/., 12s., and the charge of the D(ht per head of population is about 19 piastres, or 8s. [&gt;d., but it muut be remeinbeied that large numbers of nouiads in Eastern Turkey and in Arabia pay piactically no taxes. 67 guarantees. My reason for so doing is that, although the Debt Administration is now charged with the collection of the revenues applied for the above purpose, I am not aware that the Ministry of Tinance has reduced its expenditure accordingly, and therefore the expenses of collection must be included in the increased cost to the country of the service of the Debt, etc. I appendd also a Table (D) giving the details of the gross receipts of the revenues assigned to the service of the new loans and kiiometric guarantees in 1906 compared with 1896.

The accompanying comparative Table of the gross receipts of the railways for 1905 and 1908, and of the military transport expenses due by the Govern ment for the two years, together with the amount paid in kilometric guarantees, requires little explanation. The total gross receipts of the railways in 1906 are £ T. 11,999 in excess of those of the previous year. The three sections of the Anatolian Railway show a marked decrease of £ T. 44,340. The kilometric guarantees paid are less by £ T. 38,455, in spite of the increased amount of the guarantee of the three sections of the Anatolian Eailway, for which £ T. 26,951 more has been paid last year. This last sum would have been even greater w r ere it not that the kilomeric guarantees for the Eski-Chehir-Konia section, have reached their limit. It will be remembered that the kilometric guarantee 'was originally £ T. 604 per kilometre, but, by a later arrangement, the Government cannot be called upon to pay more than £ T. 219*78 per kilometre, and it is this latter sum which has been paid. The Company has to bear the loss between the drop in receipts of £ T. 35,469 and the increase in the kilometric guarantee paid of £ T. 19,201—namely, a loss of £ T. 16 268. The total charges for military transport were £ T. 2S,396, as against £ T. 26,730. Last year the Government paid the military transport expenses from a special grant of £ T. 30,000 on the surplus of the tithes ; this year, with the exception of those incurred by the Oriental Railway Company, which still has a fixed sum of £ T. 10,000 allotted for the purpose, the other Eailway Com panies are paid from the tithes assigned for the kilometric guarantees, and in clude them in their accounts. In my Table I have separated them. The total charges, therefore, on the tithes assigned for kilometic guarantees were the kilometric guarantees paid and the military transport expenses, which, for the Salonica-Monastir, Salonica-Constantinople J unction, and the Smyrna-Cassaba Railways, have fallen by £ T. 6,2^7, £ T. 5,156, and £ T. 3,288—namely, a a total reduction of £ T. 14,6^2. On the other hand, the Oriental Railway Company required last year for military transport £ T. 21,103 as against £ T. 4,745 in the preceding year— namely, an increase of £ T 16,357. Of this, £ T. 10,000 has been paid by a special grant from the tithes surplus and £ T. 3,269 from a balance from last year of a credit of £ T. 30,000 for the same purpose. As the balance of £ T. 7,834 has got to be paid by the Government, and as it is more than pro bable that it will come out 'of the surplus tithes, I have included it in my Table. Thus we have minus £ T. 53,143 paid for kilometric guarantees and mili tary transport together, and plus £ T. 16,537 for military transport, or a de crease of £ T. 36,791 on both items together. It must also be remembered that, according to the decision taken by the Council of the debt in September last, any deficiency in the revenues assigned for the Bagdad Construction Loan is also made good from the surplus tithes. Last year the deficiency was £ T. 35,000, and has been paid out of the surplus tithes. As it thus affects the surplus tithes remaining in our hands, I have therefore taken it into consideration in my Table. 'When the military transport expenses of the Oriental Railway Company are paid in full, the surplus tithes remaining in our hands will be only £ T. 1,790 more than last year. I also annex a Table showing the sums paid by the Government for kilometric guarantees since 1889 onwards. C^Bl^D 9[Received on 7th April 1907, with letter from the Secretary, Political Department, India Office, ]So. 12, dated the 22nd March 1907.) CONEIDENTIAL . [7332] BAGDAD RAILWAY. [March 4.] Section 1. No. I. Sir Edward Grey to Sir F. Bertie, (No. 120) Foreign Office, March 4, 1907. Sir, M. Cambon told me to-day that M. Auboyneau had been asked to go to Berlin to consult about the Bagdad Eailway. There he had met M. Zander, who had proposed to him that the Erencb group should participate in the Bagdad Railway by linking up the Syrian lines with it. The Germans were prepared to make the next section themselves, and the idea was that the Syrian Railway should be extended to meet the extension of the Bagdad Railway, and that the whole should then form one business. M. Auboyneau had replied that the French group could not participate unless an English group also joined in. M. Zander had said there Avould be considerable difficulty with public opinion in Germany about accepting the co-operation of an English group. In fact, if an English group was admitted, Germany would find herself in a minority, being in the position of 1 to 2. M. Auboyneau bad sugsrested that the balance might be redressed by bringing in a fourth group. But M. Zander had replied that this might make matters still worse. Unless Germany was quite sure of the fourth group, she might find herself in the position of 1 to 3. On M Auboyneau's return to Paris, M. Zander had followeded him there : a fact which appeared to M. Cambon to shew that the Germans could not find the necessary money themselves, and were very anxious for Erench participa tion. He desired to know my opinion. I said that Count Metternich had not mentioned the Bagdad Railway to me, but that in talking to others whom he met, and amongst them quite recently the Prime Minister, he had quoted our opposition to the Baghdad Railway as an instance of British hostility to Germany. As soon as Count Metternich returned, I proposed to tell him that I had heard of this, and to say to him that, naturally, we could not look favourably upon the creation of what might be an alternative through route to the East in the control of which we had no share. I would also tell him that, if Germany felt our opposition to the Bagdad Railway to be a political difficulty, it was for her to make proposals with regard to it, as our opposition was not irreconcilable. I also told M. Cambon that, though the Bagdad Railway form no part of our negotiations with Russia about Persia, yet it had appeared incidentally in the course of these negotiations, which had lately been making progress, that Russia had ceased to regard the Bagdad Railway as something to be opposed at all costs, and was willing to come to an arrangement with Germany about it. Indeed, she felt that no settlement with regard to Persia would be complete from her point of view unless she had some such arrangement. M. Cambon said he would report to his Government that, in his opinion, the steps taken by M. Zander clearly showed a desire for co-operation, and that in the meantime the proper attitude was one of expectation and waiting. He would also report what Count Metternidi's attitude had been, and what my intention was as to speaking to him. I am, etc. auj, cto., E. GREY. 13 C8&amp;ED(Received on the 7 th April 1907, with letter from the Secretary, Political Depart went, India Office, No. 12, dated the 22nd March 1907. BAGDAD RAILWAY. [March 7.1 CONFIDENTIAL . Section 1. [8080.J No. 1. Sir Edward Grey to Sir A. Nicolson. (No. 101.) Sir, Foreign Office, March 7, 1$07 % Count Benctendorff came to see me to-day on his return from Russia. He was very pleased with the progress which had been made with our negotiations at St. Petersburgh, and I said I was sure his own visit to St. Petershurgh had been a most useful one. I felt that his influence in the ne gotiations bad been beneficial. I then told him that we were sending our reply to the Russian proposal with regard to Persia. I observed that the sphere which they claimed was a very large one, and that it included Tehran. This was a matter of very great importance, as the fact that Tehran was in the Russian sphere was bound to increase Russian prestige there. And yet it was at Tehran, the seat of the Central Government, that any influence we migh t require would have to be exercised, even in connection with concessions or other matters relating to our own sphere only. Count Benckendorff admitted the point, and said that, owing to the situ ation of Tehran, he did not see how it could be otherwise than in the Russian sphere. I said that, of course, I saw the difficulty. But none the less, it was a consideration to be borne in mind. This was not, however, the vital point to which I wished to refer. I then explained that, in consequence of our obligations to Afghanistan with regard to frontier matters, and to Persia under our Treaty of 1857 with regard to the Perso-Afghan frontier, it was impossible, without great compli cations, to place a piece of the Perso-Afghan frontier within the Russian sphere. To do so would also complicate arrangements for direct communication with Afghan officials on local tiontier matters. It might be that Customs officials, on doctors, or persons of that kind, would have to be placed by the Russians in their own sphere ; and if such persons appeared on the Perso-Afghan frontier, our difficulties would be greatly increased. Therefore, it was vital that the Russian line should start, not from Kushan, but from Zulficar, and so avoid brining any part of the Perso-Afghan frontier into the Russian sphere. Count Benckendorff did not seem to anticipate that there would be diffi- culty ahout this, and appeared relieved that this should be the main noint to which I attached capital importance. P I also explained what we should have to propose with regard to Customs officials in our sphere if Russian had to foreclose the security for her loans. With regard to the Meehed-Seistan telegraph-line, I agreed that the transfer might be dealt with in a separate note, provided it was done simultaneouslv with the mam Agreement. Count Benckendorff saw no difficulty on either of these points. He said M. Isvolsky thought it might be necessary to take measures on the northern frontier of Persia to prevent revolutionaries crossing from the Caucasus; but he was determined to keep us informed of anything that was 14done, and to act in concert with ua. Count BenckendorfT spoke most warmly of the co-operation between us wliich had existed lately, and of the advantage of continuing it. I cordially agreed, and observed that co-operation had only been arranged just in time, for had it not been arranged before the recent disturbances in Persia began there would have been trouble. Atone time we might have increased our prestfge enormously by becoming the champions of the popular party, and great self-restraint had been necessary on our part to prevent this being trust upon us. As to interference now, I understood that the Shah might desire foreign help against his own people, but such intervention from outside would be dangerous. To this Count Benckendorff entirely assented. This part of our conversation ended without the expectation on either side that there would be any difficulty in coming to a settlement on the Persian question. Count Benckendorff then referred to Afghanistan. I explained the impossibility of our making any proposals about frontier officials and local communications till we had sounded the Ameer, who would naturally be very suspecious. Count Benckendorff referred to the Russian apprehension of any change in the status of Afghanistan. The Russians were afraid that an Afghan army, commanded and trained by British officers, would be a danger. They were, therefore, very anxious that we should undertake some engagement on the subject. I told him that I could without reserve assure him that we had no intention or desire of penetrating into Afghanistan, or changing its present siatus. We did not intend to send British officers into Afghanistan, nor had the Amir ask ed for any. During his visit to India we had made no political proposals to him, and he had made none to us. The object of the visit, so far as we were con cerned, was to prove to the Amir that we were very good friends to him, but friends who asked nothing from him, and that he had not been asked to India in order that we might make demands upon him. But I foresaw that it would be very difficult for us to undertake any en gagements about Afghanistan. There were very turbulent tribes on our own frontiers, such as the Afridisand VVaziris. There would probably be no trouble under the present Ameer, but it was always possible that some Ameer less wise might stir up the frontier tribes within our own borders, and assume an ag gressive attitude which would require measures on our part. Count Benckendorff admitted the force of this, and said perhaps some form of words might be devised by which we should engage not to do anything unless the Ameer took action which rendered measures necessary on our part. But the suggestion was very vague, and I did not think it desirable to persue the point any further. Count Benckendorff admitted that the Ameer could not be prevented from taking measures of his own to develop his country. He was aware of our general ideas about Afghanistan on other matters, and seemed sanguine of an agreement. We then spoke of the Baghdad Railway, I explained that Count Metternich had complained to others, though not to me, that our attitude towards the railway was an obstacle to good relations. I therefore intended to say to him that I thought it was not fair to make a grievance of our opposition to the Baghdad Railway, while Germany refrained from making any proposals to us with regard to it. Count Benckendorff asked me whether we would initiate any proposal, and I said, ' No. 5 * I meant to confine my statement to the point that, if Germany felt the Bagdad Railway to be a political difficulty, it was for her to make a proposal. 15Count BenckendorS said that M. Isvolsky's attitude was that lie would prefer that the railway should not be made. .But if it was to be made, the situation must be accepted, and the best terms must be made. I told him I thought the railway would be made in the long run. If it became a through route from sea to sea, it was obvious that all the Powers—- Eus-^ia, France, and ourselresjas well as Germany—trould be affected by it, and would be concerned in it. If, therefore, Germany made any proposal, I would say that I thought it should include an arrangement with Russia. But I assum ed that the German Government were already aware of M. Isvolsky's views. Count Benckendorff further said that he hoped we would co-operate in the Balkans. The Russian Government had, after some difficulty, accepted the principle that judicial reform should be worked out through the Einancial Commission. Ijsaid we had but one end in view, and that was to promote a better state of things in Macedonia. The situation was becoming difficult here, because the Balkan Committee, who were not Chauvinists, but quite the contrary, were pointing out that things in Macedonia were getting no better. I was afraid this was true. We ought, therefore, to work together this year, and try to make things better than i last year. I also said that, to be quite frank, it was our impression that the Civil Agents of Russia and Austria had not, last year, used their influence as they might in improving matters. Count Benckendorlf seemed to be fully aware of this opinion, and he did not demur to it. I told him that, as soon as the Customs question was settled, I hoped effec tive reforms would be proposed. We would be very glad to support them. In the course of this conversation Count Benckendorff emphasized M. Isvolsky's desire to extend the scope of an agreement with Japan so as to pro duce something, which might perhaps not amount to an entente, but would at any rate produce ' des relations ^ but ween Russia and [Japan. He hoped we should favour this. I said we certainly should favour a general good understanding. We could not suggest to Japan that she should make concessions on points con- nected with the Portsmouth Treaty, but we wished to promote good relations between Russia and Japan. The direct object of a settlement between Russia and ourselves was to secure the Indian frontier. But there was also an indirect object—viz.) to be on good terms with Russia ; and this indirect object would be lost unless relations between Japan and Russia were satisfactory. We wish ed, therefore, to see this secured. Mr. Bowles (Lambeth, Tsforwood) asked the Secretary for Foreign Affairs whether the acceptance by the Porte and the Powers of the conditions proposed by his Majesty s Government as to the Turkish Customs duties, and the con sequent acceptance of the extra 3 per cent, duty on imports into Turkey, would forward the construction of the Bagdad Railway. I am, &amp;c. E GREY. (Received from the India Office on 7th April 1 ). House of Commons, March 14, 1907. Turkish customs duties.Sir JS. Grey. —The proceeds of tlie additional Customs duties of 3 per cent, would be devoted to the requirements of the Macedonian Budget, and would not, therefore, he available for any other purpose. To what purposes the • financial requirements of the Turkish Empire will allow any of the rest of the Turkish revenue to be devoted must remain a matter of opinion or conjecture. Mr. Bowles was understood to ask whether there was anything in the con ditions imposed by His Majesty's Government which would prevent the alloca tion of: the sum set free by the imposition of these duties to the purpose he had mentioned. Sir JE. Grey. —It is a question as to what sum would be set free. The deficit of the Macedonian Budget, so far, has not been met out of revenue. Mr. Lynch (Yorks, W. K., Eipon) asked the Secretary for Poreign Affairs whether it was contemplated that the formulating of reforms in Macedonia should continue to rest with the Austro-Hungarian and Eussian Governments after the proceeds of the proposed new Customs duties, leviable mainly upon British goods, had been applied to the financing of such reforms. Sir B. Grey. —His Majesty's Government understand that any projects for reforms which may be formulated by the Austro-Hungarian and Bussian Governments will be submitted to all the Powers concerned, and considered by them all. The initiative is, therefore, not so important as that the reforms should be formulated upon a principle which is acceptable to all the powers, and this, I trust, is secured. Mr. Lynch asked whether the initiative was not a matter of great import ance, considering that the whole judicial reform of Macedonia rested at present with the Austro-Hungarian and Eussian Governments. Sir E. Grey said he did not say the intiative was of no importance, but what w T as more important was that when that initiative was taken the reforms should be upon principles wdiich were acceptable. The question of who took the initiative was then much more a matter of form than of substance. {Parliamentary questions and answers received from the India Office on 14th April 19 4? Q.

S ection 1. No. 1. [8119] Sir JEdtcard Grey to Sir F. Lascelles. (No. 77.) Foreign Office, March 8, 1907. Sir, I reminded Count Metternich to-day thai, in conversation quite recently with the Prime Minister, and 1 heard with others also, he had expressed him- self not altogether satisfied with the relations between England and Germany, and had instanced the Bagdad Eailway and our attitude towards it as a cause. C88FD 17I tbouglit it was not fair to go on quoting tlie Eagdad Railway when it was a subject on which we had not received any proposals from Germany. Count Metternich said he did not suppose Germany would make any pro- posals. He could not understand why we objected to commercial enter- prise on Germany's part in Asia Minior, one of the few places still left open. He had been informed by the late Government that England had no interest in the Bagdad Railway except to see that no fortified port was made on the Persian Gulf. A proposal for co-operation had afterwards been dropped, through Mr. Balfour had been strongly in favour of it. Count Metternich thought tlie apprehensions expressed in the House of Commons and in the press with regard to the Bagdad Railway ^were simply due to the suspicion and di- trust of Germany. I observed that, if the railway became an alternative route to the Far East, going from sea to sea, it could not be a purely commercial enterprise. It must have political consequences, which would affect more or less every Power in terested in the region. Count Metternich was unable to see that it could have any political aspect or strategic importance, so far as we were concerned. I maintained the opinion that the change made by so great an enterprise must be a matter of interest to neighbouring Powers. Count Metternich finally said that he doubted whether this would be a good time for Germany to propose anything. She had now made further progress with the railway. He did not think any proposal which it would be seemly for her to make with the strong position she now had in the matter would meet the views expressed over here, and she could never consent, after having made so much progress with the enterprise by herself, to be deprived of any part of it. I said I was not aware that, in any quarter, deprivation had been suggest ed. Participation was not the same thing as deprivation. Count Metternich went on to say that he saw our negotiations with Russia were piogressing favourably. I told him it was true they had been more active just lately; but they were concerned with the Indian frontier, and the scope of them could not be said to affect German interests in any way. I hope, therefore, he would under stand that they were not in any way directed against Germany, He said that, much more important than the question of The Ha one Conference or anything else with regard to relations between England and Germany, was the Anglo-French entente, and the question of whether it would be developed in a sense adverse to Germany. I replied that, in this, everything depended on whether the action of Germany was such as to put England and France on the defensive. I am, &amp;c. EDWARD GREY.

I have, &amp;c. (For Sir Frank Lascelles), GRANVILLE, Inclusure in No. 1. ConsaUGeneral Oppenheimer to Sir FLascelles. (Confidential.) Sir, Frankfort-on-the-Main, March 12, 1907, \ I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency's despatch dated the 9th February, inclosing copy of a report from His Majesty's Minister Resident at Munich, respecting the Bagdad Railway scheme so far as it is affected by the financial situation in Germany, and requeting me to furnish you with my views on the subject. His Majesty's Government being anxious to receive full and accurate information. In reply I beg to state as follows :— There is no doubt that since M. Dernburg has taken charge of the Colonial Department \m Berlin a new interest has been awakened in trains- maritime matters. If the diffidence in German colonial undertakings cannot be expected to vanish outright, German financial schemes oversea, whether in German territory or not, must in the long run benefit from the appointment. To the German mind, which is accustomed to paternal government, the crux lies not so much in the question whether the capital is invested under the German flag or not, but whether the enterprise in which it is invested has the support of ^ the Government. This being secured, there might indeed be a preference in the case of oversea expansion for territories in which there is not the danger of a constant contact with the inferior grades of German officials 19(« Assessoren Wirtlischaft'). Since M. Dernburg's appointment the support of the Government lias in all commercial questions become all the more 'valuable, as he is a commercial and financial expert of the very first class, and, while he is sure to take a bfoad view of commercial schemes, it is hoped that his views will carry considerable weight also with his colleagues. M. Dernbuig s a eiy appoint ment, then, has inspired confidence ; though he'may have been none too popu lar as a bank Director, he is certainly as the Head of the Colonial Department not unpopular with the commercial majority of the country, and more especial ly with his own fraternity of the ' haute finance.' His appointment constitu ted such an innovation in the traditional agrarian and junker regime of Ger many that the commercial world, led by the 'haute finance^ seems oh initio inclmed, from feelings akin to those of freemasonry, to assist him in making his appointment a success. During his agitatoral campaign preceding the last general election he met everywhere with a warm reception, which was no where warmer than in Frankfort, where he delivered an excellent, and perhaps 1 his most sober, speech because no doubt he knew that his audience was greatly composed of former colleagues of men who are shrewd leaders in the world of finance. I think that a real effort would, if necessary, be made by them to save him the humiliation of failure, because his appointment constitutes a new departure decidedly to the credit of their calling, which, until then, hud not been favoured by any great official distinction ; if the appointment proved unsuccessful the departure will stand discredited and is not likely to be repeated for many years to come. Probably there is also a silent conviction that if the ' haute finance' stands by M. Dernburg he will use his influence behind the scenes to bring about a satisfactory reform of the bourse laws, for so far no one has been appointed to so prominent a position in Germany with an equally thorough knowledge of the defects of the present legislation under w r hich, until quite recently, M. Dernburg had, as bank Director, himself to suffer. The financial world looks to him with all the greater confidence in this respect because he is known to be regardless and tenacious, and the right man to see a matter through; even his colleagues at the head of the Empire cannot deny that he is an authority upon tlie subject of finance. It is therefore not at all unlikely that if any financial question became a serious item in M. Dernburg's colonial scheme the support of the 'haute finance' could be secured, because M. Dernburg would have a quid pro quo to offer, and the money would probably be found as a part of a secret understanding. For the same reason any Government which is well advised would put M Dernburg forward in case it wished to secure the help of the 'haute finance' for any other transmaritime enterprise, ep., the Bagdad Eailway scheme. Here, again, the same basis for a bargain exists—possibly with a slight disadvantage to the official side, because the usual argument of patriotism could not be used. On the other hand, there is no doubt that in the eyes of many Germans a part of Turkey, namely, Asia Minor, is considered more thoroughly ^ German than some of the Garman Colonies. The so-called ' Levante-Tariff ' has worked wonders in the German commercial conquest of Asia Minor. 1 have it from British merchants that Englishmen abandoned these markets because there was no longer any cash iu them, but only ' paper,' and that the profits were rendered illusory by the long period over which their realization was protracted. If Germany to-day controls these markets and is shipping great quantities of all sorts of marchandize to the Levant it may suit ler own industrial purposes; for, especially in times of commercial depression, as, e.ff., 1U01 and 1%2, these markets enable her to keep her greatly increased commercial concerns working. The system of prolonged credit is one of the concessions made by Germans wherewith to conquer new markets, but they seem to forget that it is difficult to change the system once the markets have een seemed on this basis, and such commercial transactions are not apt in the long run to foster a friendly spirit from the buyer towards the seller— nor, inueea, vice versa. The returns of the quantities shipped, though they may seem ig uy satisiactory, contstitute no proper criterion wherewith to eaugethe real value of the market. 20n'&gt;. \ ,y.. \ I ^ The German Emperor is said occasionally to use the phrase #&lt; My friend ^ the Sultan.' The remark expresses a sentiment which is gladly accepted by p jiile| c l the Germans, because it represents a valuable item in the international commercial competition in Asia Minor. The German press prominently records fapp^ the contant exchange of stourtesis which takes place between Berlin and toop^ Constantinople. If it proudly lingers over the German diplomatic successes 'pajhj',, there {e.g., removal of fehmi Pasha) it becomes all the more remakable that i cs^, the Bagdad Railway scheme is never referred to—partly, no doubt, because oo^ij' it is not officially intended that any foreign interest in the scheme legf ' should be unduly roused, but partly also because to the commercial world it has always seemed to harbour possibilities of international entanglements, jy.' and it thus would introduce an item of uncertainty into a market, which, with jT' its long credits, requires more than all others a peaceful development. The scheme itself has, so far, only interested the haute finance,' because until its various stages are completed it is of no practical value to the commer- 5 rea &amp; cial community at large. If money were needed for the furtherence of the scheme, I think that 44 industry ' would prove most unwilling to subscribe, ^eniti more especially as the recent good years have tightened the money market all - aw round, and ^ industry ' has already raised all available money to sink it in the '3(1 iot enlargement of its concerns at home. Probably your Excellency is aware that the constructive work of the Bag^ dad Railway is being carried out by a Erankfort firm (Philipp Holzmann and Co.),' so that it is natural that a certain interest in the scheme has been kept lance' alive by the ' haute finance ' in Erankfort, which is also financially interested 3 bring in Philipp Holzmann and Co., officially styled ' Internationale Baugesellschaft, i ^ Frankfurt-a-M., and the shares of which are held in a few hands. The interest m&lt;&gt;k i n the scheme, however, centres in Berlin, as the Deutsche Bank is exclusively quite intrusted by a Turkish Trade with the financial part of the enterprise (payment nchl of interest and amortization). The Director of the Deutsche Bank, who* is the ; e jje moving spirit in the matter, is Herr Gwinner; he is also a Director of the 44 In- attei ternationale Baugesellschaft' above mentioned. 11 ^ Erom inquiries which I caused to be made in different local quarters, it would, however, appear that even the local haute finance ' is none to well ^ informed upon the subject. Prospectuses dated Constantinople, 4th (17th) cause February, 1319 (1904), are in its possession, but beyond its contents little seems My known. If inquiries are met with great reticence, I am led to believe that want of any definite information is its cause. Erench and British participation : , r in the scheme are spoken of without any definite indication ; the Deutsche : Bank, backed in this respect probably by the Government, is apparently keep- ;| w ^ ing its information to itself. rith One of my personal friends who is in touch with very vast American con- otk oerns confidentially approached a leading Frankfort financier, asking whether vesof there was any opening for investing American money to a considerable extent 'mora in the Bagdad Railway scheme, on the condition, of course, that the American called interests would then be represented on the Board. The suggestion was (so to .estof say) laughed out of court; it was explained that if Americans wished to subs- rioned cribe on the condition of obtaining a voice in the management (though it was jper* not admitted that American money, even in considerable sums, was welcome) their this could only be done in the following way :— If it were decided to accept the American offer, a reliable bank in the v ^ States (reliable in its loyalty to German interests) would be carefully selected, isaon, ail( i W otild then be instructed to receive subscriptions in the States, after it had e-f; been previously arranged that a particular Director of the American concern ^ would be appointed to represent, outwardly at least, the American interest on - the Managing Board of the Bagdad Railway scheme. Thus the man repre* iia^e senting the American interests would of course be nothing but a tool in Gey- iatltf man hands. Presumably a similar course would be followed in England if -nor, there were any intention of inviting general subscriptions there, see® 21 .realI have it on absolutely trustworthy authority that the Bagdad Railway scheme to-day stands as follows :— The French and the German financial groups have come to an agreement concerning the continuation of the railway, according to which the Germans construct the Taurus line from Eregli to Adana (220 kilom) ; the French con struct the next portion, to Haleh (Aleppo) (200—300 kilom); this would give French at Aleppo a junction for their railway lines in Syria, which, until now, have proved profitless investments. It is generally believed that Great Britain is endeavouring to prevent the construction of the Taurus line. As there is no inclination under these circumstances to give Great Britatn any chance of in fluence, British capital for the Taurus line is not wanted—for which, moreover, the capital is secured. If former negotiations with Great Britain have been discontinued for about a year, there is at present, from the German point of view, no reason for reopening them. As far as can be foreseen, there is, how ever, no reason why negotiations should not be resumed after the Taurus lines have been completed. In, fact, there seems to-day on the part of Germany a prospective desire that the negotiations should then be resumed, but not until then. I have, &amp;c. FKANCIS OPPENHEIMER. 22 G. C.

Sir, I have the honour to report that a project has been on foot for some years past for the Concession to a French Syndicate of a line of railway from Pand emia, on the sea of Marmora, to Soma, passing by Bali-Kes-ir, the total length being about 300 Kilom. A short time ago a well-known British merchant here, Mr. Henry Baker, was summoned to the Palace and told that if he would form an International Syndicate the Conjrfcession would be given to him. Mr. Baker thereupon asked me for a lett^ of introduction to the Prench Ambassador, alleging that he thought he would have more ch-mce of success if he joined forces with the Trenchman, M. Bellet, who had, with the support of the Embassy, been for several years looking after the Con^cession, and who is stated to have some influential support in Paris, his principal backer being M. Tavernier. The idea is to build the railway without any kilometric guarantee, and I believe on this account, as well as for other reasons the project is viewed with disfavour by the Anatolian and Smyrna Cassaba Railway Companies M. Constans was good enough to receive Mr. Baker and to give him to understand that personally he had no objection to the railway being intrusted to an Anglo-Prench group, promising at the same time to speak to the Sultan on the subject. Mr. Baker subsequently heard that the Sultan's answer was not altogether satisfactory, and that the ambassador regarded it as expressing His Majesty's desire not to pledge himself to M. Constans at the present moment. The railway traverses a rich and populous country, but I hope to procure shortly for Mr. Baker information which will afford any British group the means of judgins: of the capabilities of the project before undertaking tuther study and examination. The advantages to British interests of obtaining a Concession of this kind are obvious, not only as offering a new field for railway construction in Turkey, but as indirectly influencing our position as regards the Baghdad Railway, whilst at the same time affording advantages to British industry for placing in this country a large stock of railway material, it being, of course, understood that our participation with the French would secure to England half the orders. Should Mr. Baker succeed-—either alone or in conjunction with the French —in getting the Concession, he will endeavour to raise the capital in London, and in this case it is probable that application may be made to the Foreign Office for information on the subject. 1 think it well therefore to make these preliminary remarks in the hope that the Foreign Office will encourage British financiers connected with railways at all events to inquire into the merits of this business.

They are furnished by M. Bellet de Lobel, a Erench civil engineer, who has been endeavouring for years past to obtain the Concession. I inclose herewith a Report (Inclosure ]) made by M. Lobel on the country through which the Railway passes and a map (Inclosure 2).* I also annex a printed Report (Inclosure 3)* written by M. Lobel in 1898, and a copy of a further Report written in 1901 (Inclosure 4). M. Lobel states that his Concession has been approved by the Ministry of Public Works and the Council of State, as well as by the Council of Ministers, and that all that is now required is the sanction of^the Sultan. It is at this point, however, that M. Lobel found himself unable to proceed. He was opposed by the Germans and by the Smyrna-Cassaba Railway Company. Both these groups were, he states, prepared to build the line with a kilometric guarantee. The French Ambassador was informed by the Sultan that the construction of the railway was abandoned for the ixoment, and, according to M. Lobel the Smyrna-Cassaba Company, with Mr. Vitalis, who had been his competitor,' no longer enjoyed the support of M. Constans. It was at this juncture that M. Lobel, advised by his friends at the Palace, thought it indispensable te obtain British co-operation, as it was believed that, with the French and British Ambassadors working together, all opposition either on the part of the Germans or on the part of the Smyrna-Cassaba group could be overcome and the Sultan persuaded to grant the required Irade. M. Bellet de Lobel, after seeing Mr. Arthur Baker, a British merchant here, who is interested in industrial enterprise in this country and who has powerful friends at Yildiz, addressed himself to me. # Not printed.M. Jjobel's reputation lierp, like that of most concession-liunters, is not of the best, and I preferred to see the bead of the group he represented. His group in Paris consists of— Fougerrelle Ereres, Rue de Chateauduu. Compagnie de Eives, Lille. Desouches, David et Cie. Tavernier, President of the li IVIetropolitain. The latter is President of the Syndicate, and, as far &lt;is T can ascertain, is a serious man of business. 1 made an appointment with him in Paris, and he assured me (1) that he had the support of M. Pichon, and (2) that he would welcome English participation in the enterpii^p. on ter ns. I regret to state that the English group, to wliom the matter was submit ted by Mr. Baker, has refused to take the matter up. This is the present position; I have no idea what M. Lobel now intends to do. It is hardly necessary for me to state that I have no pecuniary interest in the matter wliatsoever, as I have explained to Mr. Baker and to M. Tavernier. I was appealed to in order to assist in bringing the French and English groups into line. I believe that, together, the Erench and English would have succeed ed in obtaining the Concession, and I considered that it was an opportunity for English capitalists thus to participate in a Eranco-English enterprise. I failed, however, to do anything, and I presume that the English group, to whom Mr. Baker submitted the matter, was not satisfied with the prospects of the undertaking. I thought, however, that you would like to hear about it all, and have the above Report on the proposed line.

Constantinople, April 17, 1907, Sir, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of an interesting letter which I have received from Mr. Percy Loraine, from Aleppo, reporting conversations which he had with the Valis of Beyrout and Aleppo, mainly regarding th e Bagdad Railway. I have, &amp;c. M. R. O'CONOR. Inclosure in No. 1. Mr. P. Loraine to Sir N, 0'Conor, Aleppo, March 25, 1907. Sir, It may perhaps be of interest to report that on my arrival at Beyrout era the 20th instant, Sir R. Drummond-Hay took me to call on the Vali, that on my arriving here Mr. Long worth presented me yesterday to the Vali of Aleppo, and that their Excellencies Halil Pasha and Nazim Pasha respectively touched on the question of the Bagdad Railway in the course of conversation, though no reference whatever had previously been made to that subject. Halil Pasha asked me whether it was known at Constantinople how soon the Germans intended to continue the construction of the line to Adana. ^1 replied that no announcement had yet been made on the subject, and that, as far as I knew, everyone there was in the dark about it. His Excellency went on to say what a great expense the railway, with its large kilometric guaran tees^ was to the Ottoman Government; in his belief, the Germans would continue the construction as far as Adana, but they would not get any further without the co-operation of England, Prance, and Russia. Why, he said, does not England offer to build a railway to Bagdad without a kilometric guarantee? Tiie country it would traverse is rich, and the development it would undergo when opened up by the railway would render a guarantee unnecessary. I asked His Excellency how this could be, as the Concession for the construction of a railway to Bagdad had already been granted by the Sultan. He replied that was a question that depended on what interpretation was placed on the wording of the Concession. A Concession, it was true, had been given, but according to its terms the railway was to pass through certain places ; if an alternative tracee which did not clash with the letter of the German Concession were proposed by a party willing to construct without guarantees, it would be possible to accept it, and thus to allow the remainder of the German Concession to fall through.Nazim Pasha, the Vali of Aleppo, approached the subject in precisely the same way as Halil Pasha had done, and 1 answered in the same sense as previously. After remarking on the large sums the Bagdad Railway was costing the Ottoman Government, His Excellency went on to point out the superiority, in point of view botb of cheapness and distance, of a line from Alexandretta to Mesken6 through Aleppo, connected with Bagdad, Bussorah, and the Persian Gulf by a steamer service on the Euphrates; if an English Company would come forward and propose to construct such a line without a kilometric guarantee, he felt sure it would succeed. I had the opportunity of again speaking with His Excellency this evening and in the meantime had remembered having heard of a British Company which had proposed about fifteen years ago to construct such a railway and to make the Euphrates navigable for steamers, and, further, that at about that date the monopoly of navigation on the Tigris and Euphrates had been granted to the Civil List. I asked Nazim Pasha if this were the case, and he replied in the affirmative, adding that the fact that a steamer had plied up to Meskene in the time of Midhat Pasha proved that steamer navigation on the Euphrates was possible. He admitted that the navigation was difficult owing to the habit which the river possessed of changing its bed from time to time, but estimated the. cost of putting the river into a navigable condition at 50,6oOJ. I suggested to His Excellency that any new proposal to establish a steamer service on the Euphrates would be impossible of acceptance owmo- to the monopoly held by the Civil List, and he replied that that was notlhe case, as the Concession as regards the Euphrates had lapsed, the Civil List havin^ done nothing as yet in that respect, and stated that it would accordingly be possible to accept such proposal coupled with the construction of an Alexand- retta-Aleppo-Meskene Railway without guarantees. This railway, he went on to say, 4 would present no difficulties whatever; there was not a single bridge to build, and use could be made of the new road from Alexandretta to AlepiTo, while the country between Aleppo and Meskene was perfectly flat; further] that the line would have its debouohe at the only good natural port on the' coast, and would constitute, together with the steamer service on the Euphrates, the natural overland route to India. He finally referred to the new line from Hama to Aleppo, ndiculing the strategical importance which is supposed to attach to it, entirely deprecating its commercial value—an opinion which I believe Mr. Longworth endorses—and condemning it as unnatural in contra distinction to the Alexandretta-Meskene line. The foregoing I think fairly represents tbe substance of the remarks made to me by their Excellencies. I have, &amp;c. PERCY L.

A German named Dr. Hugo Grothe, who is, he says, a geographer and ethnographist, has recently arrived at Baghdad from Mosul, but the British Consular A^ent at the latter place reports that he is a member of the German Board of Trade, and that he has written to a German firm to send out an engineer with oil pumps. Dr. Grothe proposes to leave the Tigris at a point above Amarah and visit Dizful, Koremabad, and Burujird. I communicated the substance of this message to His Majesty's Ambassa dor at Berlin yesterday, with a view to obtaining any information about Pi* Grothe of which Sir T. Lascclles may be in possession.Mr. Nicliols, after some weeks' fruitless negotiations with the Civil List during which, at times, he thought that hewas within reach of an acceptable understanding, considered that, in view of the difficulty of bringing the negotiations to a successful issue, he required more extensive powers from his Syndicate.

Inclosure in No. 1. Precis of Article in the ' Berliner Neueste Nachrichten' of May 14, 1907. Now that the Grand Vizier Eerid Pasha has entered into negotiations with the Ottoman Bank in order to prevent the construction of the Bagdad Railway by G ermany, the question of the decrease of German influence with the Porte has become part of that disagreeable diplomatic question ' the isolation of Germany.' When such a friendship as that between Germany and Turkey sud denly begins to appear questionable, it is time to look into the matter.72 It is undeniable that the reform work in Macedonia is not yet assured, in spite of the fact that the Protocol for the three per cent, increase in duties was signed on the 25th of last month. England and America, as well as other small Powers, are procrastinating, and even seem inclined to withdraw their consent. If this attempt at reform fails, as is to be feared, its moral effect on German influence in the Orient will be considerable, and it is small consolation to Ihink that Austria-Hungary and Russia will share the misfortune. Even if these reforms are successful, the reward for Germany's years of work will be a direct jeopardizing of German undertakings in Turkey. The costs of the Macedonian reform will be paid indirectly by Germany, as a result of the loan of 200,00CU. fr )m the Ottoman Bank. Geimany might justly expect that a portion of the receipts from the rise in customs should be used for the increase of the guarantee of interest for the construction of the Bagdad Eailway. Suddenly the Porte needs money 'urgently,' not only to pay over due wages, but to carry on war in Jemen, and to provide for the dowry of the Sultan'a daughter, which seem very inadequate causes for the loan. There is no doubt that England and France have led the Porte to a breach of faith with Germany. The Grand Vizier himself has tried to reimburse German capital by giving the German Bank the concessions for irrigating the extremely fertile plain of Konia, and draining the equally advantageous marsh land at Eski-Shehr. Such compensation cannot make amends for the commercial and political damage arising from a delay or hindrance in the completion of the railway to the Persian Gulf. Even if Perid Pasha gave overall the marshes of Turkey to German Companies, that fathomless morass, the greed of certain officials, would tax the strength of a Hercules. As long as there are Powers that from time to time satisfy this aun sacra fameSy the influence of tht'se Powers will continually change in Turkey. German political influence in Turkey consists in the personal confidence which the Sultan reposes in the Kaiser, and also in the respect for Germanv's military power. German influence would begin to decrease if the German officers, who form the majority of the foreign officers in the Turkish armv, were replaced by non-German Pranks, but this is not the case. The entente Powers are attempting to convince the Sultan that we are no longer feared in the Occident, and their machinations against the Bagdad Kail way seem to have been only too successful. On the 1st May, just before the German Ambassador's departure, the blow came. Herr von Marschall was obliged to protest to the Sultan against su&lt; h a breach of faith, and his protest must have been very effective. It is to be hoped that a certain transitory disagreement between Germany and the Porte will be the last evil experience with the entente on the Bosphorus, This will not hinder the completion of the Bagdad Railway. Turkey needs the railway, and as Germany alone has the concession for its construction not only to Bagdad loit further, and has thus secured a special influence, Turkey would some day be obliged to ask Germany to complete it. This is on the assumption that Germany asserts her position to the enemies round her. Ko one knows w r hat political events may happen before the proposed opening of the great railway, or how they may drag the near Orient into their circle. Constantinople has ever been important as the commercial and political key of the East. But at present its r6le as political observatory is more important for us Germans; in the Sublime Porte at Stamboul is the nearest touchstone of Germany's reputation and power in the Occident.( deceived on the 8th July 1907, with letter from the Secretary, Political Department, India Office, No. 25, datei the 21st June 1907.)

Sir, A little while ago Sir Frank Lascelles asked me whether I could procure for him some information with regard to a certain Dr. Hugo Grothe, of Munich, who was reported to be travelling about in the neighbourhood of Bagdad, and who was suspected of being engaged in prospecting for petroleum. r Jhe inlormation which I was able to procure for Sir Erank Lascelles was of a very meagre character, as nearly every inquiry I made of Germans with regard to a subject touching ^Bagdad was met by evasive replies, but I now note in the E i ankfort Gazette of a few days ago some information respecting this gentleman and his movements which it may be worth while to report to you. 7374 This newspaper says that Dr. Grofhe left in July last for Asia Minor, and that he was sent there on a mission, but by whom the paper does not state. The Doctor, after visiting many places in Asia Minor, reached Bagdad by way of Urfa. He is reported to have been very well received by Ibrahim Pasha, who is described as the powerful and intelligent Chief of a tribe of the Kurds (' Millikurden '), and to have spent a certain time in his camp Dr. Grothe, with the assistance of Ibrahim Pasha, and accompanied by one of his trussed men, follow ed the route from Harr^in to the Abdulasis Eange, passing through difficult country, which it is said has not yet been visited by Europeans. The &lt; Frankfort Gazette ' asserts that, from the reports received from Dr. Grothe, the plains of Harran, through which the Bagdad Railway will eventually pass, will become—when the line is constructed—the granary of that part of the world. Most glowing reports are also given by that gentleman as to the pros pects of Mesopotamia when the Bagdad Railway shall have been constructed, and when agriculture again begins to get the upper hand over nomadic life. Dr. Grothe reports very favourably as regards German activity in those parts, and he states that he found a5 German settlers at Marash, 18 at Aleppo, 17 at Urfa, 30 at Mesereh, near Kharput, 14 at Bagdad, 5 at Diarbekir, 2 at Mush, 4 at Wan, &amp; at Mossul, 4 at Assur, 4* at Babylon, and 3 at Bussorah. At Marash, IJrfa, and Diarbekir there appear to be German hospitals with German doctors, who do a great deal of good work, especijilly among the Mus sulman population. Dr. Grothe points out the necessity of also establishing German hospitals at Mossul and Bagdad, as they w r ould greatly help to spread German influence in those regions ; as yet Germany's influence cannot be compared to that exercised by certain other foreign nations. If the German- Bngdad Railway scheme is to become a real means for placing German influence in a dominant position in Asia Minor, she must exert herself more than she has done of late, as other nations are ahead of her already, and will do all in their power to resist the advance of German influence ; already the United States, Prance, and Great Britain exert widespread influbnce through their missions and schools in the Bagdad district, and in Asia Minor generally. At Mossul, Bagdad, and Bussorah the French Dominicans and Carmelites are struggling hard to maintain the supremacy of Erench among the foreign languages spoken by the native population. Every year these monks teach their language to at least 000 children, and when one considers that this has been going on for many years, one cannot help recognizing that this process must have a considerable political influence in that p irt of the world. Germany suffers from want of money to propagate her language, and she cannot compete with American, Briiish, and French Missionary Societies, who are continually receiving large legacies from pious benefactors. Dr. Grothe adds that another weapon of French influence in Bagdad is the ' Alliance Israelite,' who have brought up some 50,000 to 60,000 Jewish children in the Bagdad district in the knowledge of the French language. The Doctor reports that the establishment of a German line of steamers to the Persian Gnlf and to Bussorah has proved of great advantage to German trade in those parts, and he shows how inadequate is the present steamer traffic on the Tigris for coping with the growing trade in Mesopotamia. It would almost seem as if he intended to suggest that Germany should use her commanding position at Constantinople to endeavour to obtain a concession for herself to run steamers on the Tigris in the general interests of trade, and he notes that the Turkish officials at Bagdad are most friendliiy disposed towards-Germany, and desirous of increasing the prosperity of those provinces. The ' Frankfort Gazette ' asserts that Dr. Grothe will travel through the southern parts of Persia, and finally find his way to Tehran, but no allusion is made to his being the representative of any German firms interested in the petroleum trade, or that he is on his own initiative prospecting for o k il.

The Frankfurter Zeitung, ' which is usually well informed as regards eommercial and financial questions, has recently published a statement to' the ettect that the Porte, « hich is m negotiation with the Ottoman Bank for a loan fhp 6 ^ 0 1- f of tlie lighthouses, has concluded an arransemeut with hank for the advance of 200,000/., at 7 per cent, interest, and has assigned i thG revenus concedes. This operation concluded with nf — 0 tlle Sultan cannot fail to excite much attention, any assignment he surplus of the revenus concedes having been considered as out of the question, as Turkey was reserving them for the continuation of the Bagdad Hailway. It is impossible to disguise the fact that the further pro-ress of'that enterprise is postponed ad calendas Grcecasr l o • • A - n f r ^ cle a subsequent number of this paper, entitled ' Manoeuvres against the continuation of the Bagdad Railway, Repeats the same ^aterent^ 75adding that this operation may be looked on as the preliminary attack of the enemies of the railway in order to hinder its progress, and that probably the Franco-English forces which inspired it are trying to ^et control of the surplus of the revenus concedes with a view to extorting better terms for their partici pation in the scheme. No notice of the foregoing is taken by the Kolnische Zeitung,' which announces that Baron von Marschall, before quitting Constantinople on leave, received the most satisfactory, though verbal, assurances as to the employment of this surplus for kilometric guarantees. An inquiry was recently undertaken by the ' Gaulois ' as to the opinion of prominent business men in Germany with regard to closer financial and commercial relations with Prance. In the course of the interview with tlie correspondent of that paper, Herr Gwinner, the Director of the Deutsche I3ank, said:— ' Have we not for example equal interests in the Bagdad Railway Com pany respecting which so many gross inaccuracies have been circulated ? I can speak with authority on the subject, as I am the President of this Company which some persist in calling German, but which is essentially international. ,, There may be some doubt as to whether Herr Gwinner's statement was made with the object of obtaining more Erench capital without French control or whether, if lie has recently met with a check, he wished to put out a feeler with a view to paving the way to an international understanding.

I have, &amp;c., FRANK C. LASCELLES Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum hy Lord Cranley, (Secret.) I had some conversation yesterday with Dr. von Schwabach on the subject of the Bagdad Railway, and more especially in regard to the rumour published 76in the cc Standard ' that a concession had been received hj the Germfins to construct a railway from Bagdad to Tehran, with extensions to Hillah and Kerbela. Dr. von Schwahach, who is a Director of the railway, assured me that there was no truth in the rumour, for the following reasons : — 1. If the Deutsche Bank had received such a concession, negotiatioDs on the subject must have taken place both at Tehran and Constaniinople, and it was inconceivable that a hint of these negotiations should not have reached Sir N. O'Conor or Sir C. Spring-llice. 2. The Deutsche Bank were at present very busy with the scheme of constructing the railway beyond Eregli, and he doubted if they were able to conduct the two schemes at the same time. It was of course, possible that the German group had obtained a blockin? corcession of the railway from Bagdad to Tehran, with no obligation to corn' mence construction themselves; but he was inclined to believe there was no truth in the rumour. He then introduced me to Herr Testa, formerly German Dragoman at the Embassy in Constantinople, and now E/eprcsontative of the German bondholders on the Ottoman Debt. Herr Testa was very positive that there was no truth in the story. He declared several times that he had heard no word of it at Constantinople, and he repeated Dr. von Schwabach's anrument that, had any negotiations of the kind taken place, His Majesty's Legation at Tehran could not have failed to hear of them. I asked him what would, in his opinion, be the basis of the rumour, and he replied that he thought that it owed its origin to the concession granted in the Convention of March 1903 to construct a railway from Sadije to Khanikin, and he also said that the Persian Ambassador at the time the Convention was concluded was a gentleman who possessed large estates on the Turco-Persian frontier. His Excellency, who hoped to profit considerably by the line were it constructed, had been very anxious to procure its construction.

In the course of conversation with my Russian colleague a few weeks ago His Excellency told rae that he believed the German Minister, M. de Kiderlen, was doing all he could to persuade the Sultan to give a formal guarantee of certain revenues for the issue of State bonds for the next two or three sections of the Bagdad Railway, or at any rate for the Taurus section. The estimated cost of this section is about 120,( 00,TOO fr, of which 54,000,000 fr. would be represented by the new issue, and the balance provided by the surplus of the Eregli section and by loans from the issue of new shares of the Anatolian Rail way Company, and the appropriation of that Company's reserve funds. A Greek banker, who is a member of the Anatolian Railway Board, much interested also in the Bagdad Railway, called upon me to-day and gave me confidentially the following information:— He said that he had written a short time ago to M. Gwinner pointing out that, even if the Porte were inclined to hypothecate certain revenues for the Bagdad Railway, it was almost certain that the British and Erench Delegates on the Debt would be instructed to refuse to collect those revenues, and that in this case they would really be of little value as neither the Imperial Government nor the Bagdad Railway Company were in a position to effect the collection. For this and other reasons my informant advised that the further construction of the line should be susnended for the present to allow time for further negotiations with the British and French Governments. It was not, he said, desirable that the financiers who were interested in the Bagdad Railway and sympathized with the enterprise should be loaded up with unmarketable stock. M. Gwinner had thanked him for his letter, and replied that what he said would receive most careful consideration. My informant went on to say that he believed this view was shared by a good number of the Board, but that it was opposed by M. Testa, German member of the Ottoman Debt Council, and the confidential adviser of Baron von Marschall, and that, while talking on the subject a shorb time ago to the German Ambassador in Paris, His Excellency told him that his lips were closed as regards the Bagdad Railway, but that he confessed he did not understand the attitude of M. Testa and those who wished to rush the question before it was seen whether any arrangement with England and France were practicable. My informant's own opinion was that the Germans would shortly be oblig ed to approach the British and French Governments again. I have, &amp;c., N. R.

I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the Annual Report of the Anatolian Railway for the year 1906.♦ A short precis of the contents has been made. The result hardly seems to be very satisfactory as compared with the pre ceding year. There appears to have been a general shrinkage in receipts as against a slight increase in working expenses and, of course, an increase in the amount due by the Turkish Government for kilometric guarantees. Thanks to the latter, a dividend at 6 per cent.—the same rate which was paid last year- has been declared. In pasre 8 (first paragraplOof the Report made to you by the Bagdad Rail way Committee on the 26th March last, figures were given as to the gross receipts per mile of the Eski-Chehir-Konieh section, and the working expenses per mile of the whole line from Haidar Pasha to Konieh for the year 1905. These figures were quoted as an indication of the probable position of the Konieh- Eregli section of the Bagdad Railway. I beg to inclose a note comparing these figures with those of 1906. I also beg to inclose the Report of the Company for the port of Haidar Pasha,* which is practically in the same hands as the Anatolian Railway. This Report is given in both French and German.

The losses are chiefly 1 due to the falling off in passenger and goods traffic on the main line and Eski -Chehir -Konieh extension, and is explained by the fact that there were less military and naval officers and men carried over the lines than in 1905.

Block has on various occasions deprecated the hypothecation of additional revenues for the purpose of kilometiio guarantees, for the reason that the Ottoman Government does not secure an adequate return for the sacrifices made, and that such hypothecation must therefore result in the accumulation of external and unproductive debt, but the fact that the Council of the Debt has already consented to levy revenues allocated to the Koniah-Eregli section of the Bagdad Railway would not improbably be used as an argument for not withholding its services in the collection of revenues allocated to other sections of the railway.

I have more than once discussed this point with Sir Adam Block, and have found him quite ready, should the occasion arise, to show his reluctance to extend the operations of the Council to the collection of additional revenues for enterprises only indirectly conaected with the Public Debt. At the same time the question of such an extension of the Debt's opera tions is not on the tapis for the moment. The surplus of those revenues, the collection of which is already in their hands, would, if cleared of the temporary charges, suffice for the kilometric guarantees of several sections of the Baghdad Railway, but this surplus is the only important security now left for a loan which may be necessary for the pressing and immediate needs of the Govern ment.

Cambon to-day that I heard there were difficulties both at St. Petersburgh and at Paris about our Baghdad Railway proposal. I had put it forward as the condition which would be satisfactory to us, in order to prove that we were not irreconcilable in our opposition to the railway. But if the Erench Government thought our proposal was impossible, we should be glad to know their objections and to discuss any other suggestion which they tiad to make. I should like it to be clearly understood that we were not 1pressing anything at the moment, but that if the Baghdad Railway began to move sgfunj the m&amp;tter would he discussed with us. M. Camhon said the objections to our proposal were three— 1. The Sultan would never give such a concession for the Baghdad end. 2. Eussia would never agree to the condition we had put forward. 3. It could not be reconciled with the internationalization of the line. I said my idea had been that France, Germany, and ourselves should all construct and work different sections, but under an international Board; and Eussia would make her own connection, and so come in under the same Board, on the same sort of terms. M. Cambon said Russia did not wish the railway connection from the Caucasus to the Persian Gulf, because she thought the result would be to open the way for British and German trade, to her own disadvantage. He understood that what I meant was that the proposal we had put forward was a desire, and not a condition, and he would so inform his Government. I am, etc., E. GEEY. 2 Q. C. B.

Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith a despatch from His Majesty's Acting Consul at Aleppo, describing th3 proposed route of the Baghdad Railway. I have, &amp;c., N. R. O'CONOR. Inclosure in No. 1. Acting Consul Heathcote-Smith to Sir N. O'Conor. (No. 25.) Aleppo ; July 17th, 1907, Sir, I have the honour to state that I arrived at Aleppo from Constantinople, having as far as possible followed the proposed route of the Baghdad Railway. The nature of the first two days'travel, which bring one to Konia, is^ a matter of common knowledge. When the splendid station at Konia, with its adjoining first-class hotel erected by the Anatolian Railway Company, are left behind, the train continues its path over the endless and monotonous plateau which it had been traversing ever since leaving Eski-Shehr. The permanent, way on this last section has been constructed so as to allow trains to run at 100 kilom. (62J miles) the hour, although up to Konia the line was built to allow of only 60 to 70 kilom. an hour. The country here, as before, is only moderately fertile, and would require some big irrigation scheme to be carried out (it has been proposed to utilize Lake Bey-Shehr) to make it richly productive. The treeless plain, dotted with but rare villages, and these always far distant from the stations, continues up to Eregli, a small, unprepossessing kaimakamlik, that showed no visible signs of having benefited from the presence of the railway.All along this section the stations are most excellent buildings, and every thing has been done to give an impression of power and wealth. Although the higher officials are German, there has been no attempt to give too German a character to the line. Not a word of German is to be seen anywhere; all notices are in the two languages, Turkish and French, and, where necessary, Armenian and Greek also. There is a certain amount of ineffectual opposition to the railway in this district, for the existence of the camels as a means of transport is being vitally menaced. The houses of this region are miserable, being usually one-storied, and at that built with mud walls ; the inhabitants, who are Turkish (Anadols), wear expressions of the most apathethic ignorance, and a long time would elapse before they would feel need of wants which cannot be supplied locally ; of course, the railway would still be useful in exporting their produce. From Eregli, a town of some 300 dwellings, marked, by a belt of trees, I passed onto the 8th kilom, beyond, where the railway, after passing a small station called Boulgourlou, some 3 miles from a village of the same name, suddenly ends abruptly in a field, without a stick or stone to show the direction of the proposed continuation. Here begin the lower spurs of the Taurus Mountains, and after a gradual and easy ascent for some hours, during which the country becomes more and more stony, and all signs of habitations are left behind, the line would enter the actual mountains, passing to the left of the Bulgar mine, a rich silver-lead deposit, now being imperfectly worked by the Sultan. At this point, near a place called Chifle Han, a long and winding narrow defile would have to be negotiated, and the railway would finally find its way through the Cilician Gates, or there is an alternative route through the hills rather to the north. In any case, a great number of tunnels would be necessary, and' the nature of the country be similar—massive rocky defiles ; in all, some sixteen to twenty tunnels have been judged necessary. From the centre of the pass onwards to Adanathe slopes are well-wooded, with pines, firs, walnut and many smaller trees, and soon the hills open out, and would render the engineering much easier, although the descent into the Adana Plain is a sudden one. The Taurus Mountains turn their more fertile side to the Plain of Adana, but the sparseness of the inhabitants still continues. Once down in the plain the cultivation is comparatively intense, the chief product being cotton. ^ The three towns in the Plain of Adana—Mersina, Tarsus, and Adana—are all in a state of prosperity, and they are well built, owing to a fine white stone found in the neighbourhood. The existing French railway is in a most decayed condition ; no fresh stock has been added for many years, and the stations compare most unfavourably with those of the Anatolian line. It is said that the capital has already been mostly transferred to German hands, and the new manager at Mersina, Mr. Bellart, has made several alterations by which the Company shall be run on lines more similar to those of the Anatolian Railway. At Eregli there were no foreigners of any kind. In Adana itself there are some four Germans, who have tried to acquire land, but all kinds of difficulties have been put in their way, and requests for Concessions to build factories have been met with the same persistent opposition by the Turks. Adana is undoubt- edly a growing town, but a railway from it towards Killis, and then on to Aleppo, provided a line was constructed at the same period to Alexandretta, would probably cause all the commerce to flow by way of Alexandretta rather than benefit Adana and Mersina, which lie on the other side of the Amanus (Giaour) Mountains. Continuing the road through the cotton-fields to the east, the line was marked out by telegraph poles as far on as Missis at the time of the original construction of the Mersina-Adana Railway. At Missis some isolated hills begin, but the railway could circumvent these. The large and growing Kaza J wfet| otHam'die is soon reached from Missis. This township, which is bustling with life, was formerly called luzgat, hut the Sultan had it peopled with Circassian immigrants and named it after himself. Counting the neighbouring villages there are now some 12,000 inhabitants there. D • T he , s . oil all / oun( ' here ^tremely fertile, and the line would run alons in the plain as far as Osmanieh, a small and sleepy taza of about 1,500 inbabi- tants lying at the entrance of a long valley leading due east into the Amanus Mountains. 1 rom this point onwards to Killis there are no sort of roads at present, and rough horse-tracks are the only ways leading across the mountains Villages are rare, but not as infrequent as in the Taurus Mountains, while cu tiva ion is carried on to a much greater extent, and the country from here to Bagtche, can be described as being very moderately fertile. i ogli J ^ Some two hours' ride from Osmanieh the railway would have a difficult hill the 5 overc / )me ' an ^ ^ 8n would enter the broad valley of the Kara Su up to L-a ^ Bagtche, a tiny kaza among the mountains. From here onwards to Kazan Ali the engineering would be of extreme difficulty, and several long tunnels would be necessary. When the stony hills have been passed by the horse-track there is an almost sheer descent of many hundred feet into a plain (Arslan Plain) which runs due north and south. The railway would emerge on to the plain near Kazan Ali, ^ a village which is just a collection of a few mud huts deserted in summer owing to the heat. The line would here run due south past the ruins of Shamal, where German excavations have been going on The plain is fertile, but asain very sparsely populated. Islahie, a small kaza of barley, 1,000 inhabitants, lies on the route, but otherwise, from Bagtche to Killis, nothing but villages are passed. Beyond Islahie there is a large forest, and the country here is considered unsafe, but certainly not in a degree to affect the building of a railway. From here onwards the route would lie due southwards along the foot of the JCurd Mountains, and though a good deal of embanking, cutting, and bridging«over would have to be undertaken, no tunnels should be necessary. The line wTmld pass some 8 miles south-east from Killis, following an easterly direction. The country all round here is of an extreme fertility, and villages very plentiful; the inhabitants even enjoy the rare reputation of being hard working. From here on to Aleppo the country is well known. The line lies over a rich, undulating plain, where the difficulties of construction would be few, and the financial advantages are apparent. At Aleppo, again, one finds Germans pushing their interests to a certain extent, but on the whole certainly no schemes of colonization on these sections of the line can at present be attributed to them. As to whether the country between Eregli and Killis is highly mineralized little is known definitely at present, but it seems certain that the Taurus Mountains hide a good deal of mineral riches. Forests are at present fairly plentiful, but if the Railway Company may cut wood as it wishes, and no afforestation is taken in hand, the country would soon present a very naked aspect. It is undoubted that there is room for a larger population in the Plains of Adana and around Eregli and even Killis, and were cultivation carried on by intelligent people, and with modern means, the prosperity of these regions would soon increase in a very marked degree. In the Plain of Adana quite a number of agricultural machines have been introduced, elsewhere they are scarcely known, while as for means of communication, even passable roads for wheel traffic lack between centres of importance.

Geoff ray to-day that, though I had not yet seen Sir Charles Hardinge, he had sent me a written account of his interview with Prince Billow. It had been very favourable, and friendly in tone. The only subjects winch it had been arranged that Sir Charles Hardinge should initiate with Prince Biilow were the trouble caused by Morenga, who bad made an incursion from British territory into German South-West Africa, and the Hague Conference, with regard to which it was to be pointed out that the Gei man Government must now feel quite sure that whatever differences of opinion might have arisen, the whole conduct of the British delegation had no political motive. Prince Biilow volunteered the statement that he was satisfied from M. Isvol- sky that the interests of Germany would in no way be affected by the pending Anglo-Bussian Agreement, and he had said that he would welcome the conclu sion of such an Agreement, as likely to make for peace. With regard to Morocco, Prince Biilow had said that he was most anxious for an improvement in the relations between France and Germany. He thought this could be effected by a display of tact on both sides, especially on the part of the local Representatives of the two Powers. He was convinced that France had no intention of attacking Germany. And he gave most formal assurances that Germany bad no intention of attacking France, nor of creating difficulties for her in Morocco. He realized the difficulties which France already had in Morocco, and he did not desire to increase them. He had sent instructions that the Moorish authorities were to be made to understand that as long as France and Spain acted in conformity with, and within the limits of, the Algeciras Act, the Moorish authorities would have no support from the German Government or German Eepresentatives in opposition to France and Spain. All Prince Biilow wanted w^as that German traders and merchants should not be unfairly treated by the French authorities, and should not be excluded from fair competition. M. Geoffray said all that France desired was to act in conformity with the Algeciras Act. He further observed that during the last few weeks there had been a favourable change in the attitude of the German Legation in Morocco. I said it was very likely that when Prince Bulow spoke of the need for tact on the part of local Representatives, he had Dr. Rosen in his mind. It had been arranged that Sir Charles Hardinge was not to say anything about the Baghdad Railway unless the Germans mentioned it to him. 4U j P , rin , Ce ?

Sir CWI m Hardinge had told him, and Baron d'Aerenthal said this seemed a very natural view for us to take. J I had, of course, no doubt that the Germans had instigated Baron d'Aeren- thal's question. And I reminded M. Geoffray of what I had already said to M. Cambon about the railway : that the Memorandum we had put forward was not final, but intended to prepare the way for discussion, and that though we did not press for discussion we expected the subject would be discussed with us whenever it came up At Isehl, Sir Charles Hardinge had spoken to Baron d'Aerenthal of the urgent need for the Powers to do something to discourage and repress the action of the bands in Macedonia. Baron d'Aerenthal had received the idea, favourably, and I understood was discussing it with Russia. The reports from Macedonia about the Greek and Bulgarian bands were very bad, and it was more than ever necessary that the Powers should take this seriously into their consideration. I understood that the Austrian and Bussian Ambassadors at Constantinople were communicating to their collea gues proposals about judicial reform. I am, &amp;c., E. GREY. G. C. B.

Dear Mr. Montgomery, I have learned only to-day who are the two banks that have undertaken to finance the railway from Tripolis to Horns. They are the Deutsche Bank and the Dresdner Bank. Three weeks ago the Moslem Company, Ezzedine and Co., deposited in the Ottoman Bank their share of the price of the Concession, viz*, 20,0001. out of 40,000^. The German hanks have not kept their engagement to do the same, and I believe that they took up the affair only to prevent it from falling into the hands of a rival, who might build the railway, which would be a most serious danger to their own extension of the Mersina-Adana Railway to Aleppo. Tripolis will easily be made the best sea end of the Syrian railways, and the short railway—80 kilom.—is easy and cheap. The total capital needed for Construction and working is only 320,000/., estimated by a good Scotch engineer. The Moslems offer to put up half the capital (or a good deal more than half, if they can get an English registered Company to take up the business). The engineer, Skinner, gives them a very high character for straightforward dealing, and says they have plenty of money, but they want English associates and English protection. As I mentioned to you, I was under the impression that the enterprise had been taken up in London, until I went to town last week. Then I learned that a German named Ducker, of Frankfurt, representing two banks, was the person who had taken up the enterprise, and that the Preliminary Agreement had been signed, and the Moslems had deposited at once their half of the Concession money needed in Constantinople. The Germans made a condition that they should get the whole of the debenture issue, 100,000/., 6 per cent, at 80, the balance of the total capital, viz., 220,0001, to be issued in ordinary shares. The matter now stands in that condition. The Moslems had at first stipulated that no Germans should be allowed in, as they distrust the Germans and dislike them, and now, as things are, they think that the stipulation was a wise one. The railway is one that must be made some time ; Nature wills it so. The enterprise is one of great possibilities. Yours faithfully, W. M. RAMSAY. G. C. B. P., Simla.—No. C-540 F. D.-2-11.07-.10.-E.

SIR; Witli reference to your despatch No. 403 of the 28th September last, I have the honour to report that I have made inquiries of His Majesty's Consul- general at Beirut and His Majesty's Consul at Aleppo respecting the Moslem Company which is said to have obtained a Concession for a railway from Tripoli to Homs. Mr, Longworth has little information to give, but the inclosed despatch from Sir R. Drummond-Hay, which shows that the affair has made but little progress at present, may be of interest. I have no knowledge of the standing of Messrs. Earn say. Marshall, or Skinner, in London, but, unless other facts have reached your Department, I do not think that the scheme is in any way promising. It is certain that it would arouse strong French opposition and equally strong German opposition, in view of the Trench and Ge.rman railway interests to which it would run counter, and, even on its own merits, the line would not follow the most profitable route for a railway in that region, as Alexandretta, which has a Liter harbour and a wider field of distribution, should be the terminus rather than Tripoli. . . Por these reasons I am inclined to think that the Concession is mere y one of the many worthless Concessions which are hawked from the Palace, and is unlikely to be developed.

D.2 to permit the names of some of the larger subscribers to appear in the Concession obtained from the Porte, they withdrew their names, and the whole project hangs in the air for the present, at least. Mustafa Ezzedine, who was lately in Beirut, informed me that he visited Constantinople and obtained a promise for the Concession from Tahsin Pasha through the medium of Nijjib Pasha Mclkame, and that the above -mentioned sum of money will be deposited in a bank and paid on delivery of the Firman. Mustafa has also visited England and entered into negotiation with Messrs. Skinner, Marshall, and Ramsay. These gentlemen began by forminc an Anglo-German Syndicate, which fell through, and they are now makin? other arrangements with exclusively English capitalists. The distance between Tripoli and Horns is 90 kilom., and the expenses for constructing a railway are estimated at 320,000^., including the costs of the Concession, etc. There exists at present a diligence service between Tripoli and Homs, and the Moslems who wish to join Ezzedine in applying for the Concession are the principal shareholders of the Diligence Company, I believe the managers of the Erench railway enterprise (Damas-Biredjik) are almost certain to raise objections to the construction of the line Tripoli- Homs by the would-be concessionnaires, basing their opposition on Article 36 of their own Concession of 1309, and claiming preference for all new branches from their main line to the sea. On the other hand, the Concession of the Tropoli-Homs Diligence Company, dated December 1297, contains clauses in Articles 9 and 10 'ivinff them clearly preference to construct a railway to Homs. With regard to the Baghdad Pvailway, Article 12 of the Concession autho rizes the exploitation of every new branch from the main line to the Mediterranean between the port of Mersina and that of Tripoli, in Syria.

If these receipts do not suffice, the Ottoman Government will make up the deficit from some other source, and if they more than suffice the balance will go to them. It is interesting and satisfactory to note that the arrangement which was originally to be made with the Civil List is now made with the Government and signed by the Ministers of Finance and Public Works. But the contract has not been signed, and the difficulties at the Palace overcome without, it is alleged, considerable ' extraordinary ' expense, and certainly straining even to an unusual degree the patience and temper both of the German Embassy and of the very able General Manager of the Anatolian Railway, M. Huguenin. I have, etc., N. E. O'CONOR.

Section 8. [614.] No. 1. Extracts from the Times of 6th January 1908. G erman R ailways in A sia M inor. Constantinople, 30th December 1907. On the 23rd instant a contract was signed by the representatives of the Government and of the Anatolian Railway Company, by which the latter is authorized to double its share capital, at present amounting to 67,500,000 fr. (2,700,000/. nominal). This important increase has been decided on as the simplest method of providing the capital necessary for certain costly under takings upon which the Company is shortly to embark. Of the existing share capital only 60 per cent, has been paid up, and the expediency of calling in the outstanding balance was considered, but the idea was abandoned as being liable to prejudice holders by forcing many who could not meet the call to part with their shares. At a meeting of the Board of the Anatolian Railway and Deutsche Bank on Saturday last it was decided that the Deutsche Bank should take over all the newly created stock and subscribe immediately only 10 per cent., undertaking to meet further calls gradually, according to the needs of the Railway Company. These needs thus provided for are — First, the cost of doubling the line from Haidar-pasha to Pendik, a distance of about 50 kilom.; Secondly, the capital required for the Koniah irrigation works; and Thirdly, the cost of improving and strengthening the Anatolian line to per mit the running of an express service in connection with the Baghdad Railway. The first of these undertakings will entail an expense of about 3,000,000 fr. (120,000?.), on which the Government have already guaranteed 5 per cent, interest, to be derived from the excess receipts of the suburban line over the average receipts of the last ten years. The second scheme will consume 20,000,000 fr. (800,000/.), to which another 2,000,000 fr. (80,000/.) must be reckoned as interest until completion of the work. The special guarantees for this outlay have already been described ; the Government guarantees a mini mum of 5 per cent. In the third matter the Company is bound by the Bagh dad Railway Convention to spend a minimum of 8,000,000 fr. (320,000/.) on the repair and improvement of the Haidar -pasha-Koniah and Eskishehr- Angora lines, to permit the running of express trains ; a sum of 350,000 fr. (14,000/.) from the surplus of tithes affected to the kilometric guarantees of the line will be paid to meet the interest and sinking fund on the sum of the disbursements under this head. Incidentally, it may be mentioned that the Government undertakes to provide an equal sum of 350,000 fr. to meet the special loss on the express service, which, however, only begins when the line has reached Aleppo. ^Finally, the Company anticipates spending some money on the renewal of a part of its rolling -stock and the acquisition of sundry other materials, which it has hitherto been unwilling or unable to afford. Although the Government guarantees only per cent, on two of these undertakings, the Company is persuaded that the improved returns will enable it to maintain a dividend of 5 per cent, on shares. i G.

Hardinge on the 22nd instant, and, by direction of the Russian Ambassador, communicated to him the substance of a Confidential letter from M. Isvolsky, on the subject of the Bagdad Railway. Its purport was to the effect that M. Isvolsky had read with interest the account sent him by Count Benckendorff of what had passed between the German Emperor and myself at Windsor, and between Herr von Schon and myself here, relating to the railway. M. Isvolsky was so good as to say that he highly appreciated the attitude assumed by us in the matter, for which he expressed his sincere thanks. As in England and France, there was and could be no sympathy in Russia for the projected construction of the Bagdad Railway. Without mentioning the strategic side of the question, great anxiety was felt in Russia as to the influence which the consequences of the building of the line would have on the actual situation in the Caucasus, Asia Minor, and Persia. It was particularly in the latter country where a junction of the Bagdad Railway with the future Persian Railways would imply an extention of German Commercial interests and competition with existing trade, that alarm for the future was felt. Although England and France had preserved their liberty of action, Russia had not the same position of absolute freedom, since at the beginning of the recent Anglo-Russian negotiations M. Isvolsky had given assurances to Germany that no action would be taken which could in any way prejudice German interests without previous discussion with the German Government. Views had consequently been exchanged between Germany and Russia, with a view to obtaining from [Germany guarantees against the extension of German influence in Persia and to overcoming the opposition of Russia to the construction of the railway. From this exchange of views there have been no results. rrUrt, nf mv intRrviews mentioned above was that a new I am, &amp;c., E.

For the present I will merely say that beyond that point there is absolutely nothing, and that it is impossible, financially, for anything to be done without all the world knowing about it. I shall hope soon to send you some notes on the mountainous district between Eregli and Killis, In case there arises any point in regard to which I could be useful, kindly note that my address, up to the Indian mail which leaves London on the 3rd January, is c/o our Consulate, Bagdad.

ASIATIC TURKEY. [February 3.1 CONFIDENTIAL Section 2&gt; No. 1. [3711] Sir N. 0'Conor to Sir Edward Grey{Received February 3). (No. 44. Confidential.) Fercii January 28, 1908. Sir, I have the honour to report that a contract was signed on the 25th ultimo between the Anatolian Railway Company and the Minister of Public Works authorizing the doubling of the Company's present capital, thus raising it to 135,000,000 fr. The whole of the new shares are to be taken up by the Deutsche Bank, which is to pay a first call of 10 per cent, immediately, and undertakes to pay further calls as required by the Company. The money is required for the execution of two Concessions recently obtained by the Anatolian Railway Company 3 viz. : the irrigation of the Konia Plain at a cost of 19,000,000 fr., and the doubling of the line from Haider Pasha to Pendik at a cost not to exceed £T. 100,000. I transmit herewith the Conventions relating to these two Concessions, as well as a confidential Memorandum on this development of German enterprise in Asia Minor, which Sir Adam Block has forwarded to the Council of Eoreign Bondholders in London. It will be noticed that the details of the irrigation scheme differ materially from those previously reported by this Embassy. At the close of his interesting Memorandum Sir A. Block refers to an advance of £r. 240,000 which has recently been made to the Turkish Govern ment by the Anatolian Railway Company, £T. 200,000 of which is secured on the G overnment's share of the*surplus of the ceded revenues. I havej&amp;c., N. E.O'CONOR,Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Memorandum. Three matters of paramount interest to the country and to German enterprize and finance have recently occurred, concerning which I have deemed it necessary to obtain information, and which I propose to treat seriatim in this Memorandum. They are :— 1. The irrigation of the Plain of Konia. 2. The doubling of the line from Haider Pasha to Pendik. 3. The doubling of the nominal share capital of tbe Anatolian Eailway Company. 1. I annex copy of the Convention between tbe Ministry of Pinance and the Director-General of the Anatolian Railway regarding the irrigation of the Plain of Konia. From the perusal of this Convention it will be seen that works will be undertaken for the canalization of the waters of the Lake of Bey Chehirand the Rivers of Bey Chehir and Tcharchambar Tcliai, and for the draining of the Lake of Karaviran ; 550,000 deunums (about l^OOtf acres) of land will be brought under cultivation. The work will be begun in March, and completed in six years. The total cost is 19,500,000 fr., to be advanced by the Railway Company. This sum will be repaid in thirty-five years from the date of conclusion of the works ; the interest is at 5 per cent. The security is (1) £T. 25,000 per annum paid by the Council of the Debt from the surplus of the ' revenus divers ' ; (2) the surplus of the tithes revenue of the lands brought under cultivation over and above tbe average revenue of the last five years ; (3) the net receipts from the irrigation works' (4) the net receipts of the drained and irrigated lands, to be put up to sale for the establish ment of Mussulman villages, independently of lands reserved for Mussulman immigrants, and, lastly, in case of insufficiency the Government will provide other security. The above are in resume the chief points of the Convention. There is no doubt whatsoever that the result will be beneficial to the country. The area of cultivation to be drained and irrigated is expected to become most fertile. The tithes will increase, population will be attracted nither, and the Railway Company will benefit by a large increase in tbe traffic receipts. It is essential, however, that the class of peasant to cultivate the lands in question should be the industrious class. Mussulmans from Asia Minor, settbd in an s 0 the harvest one year in three can be expected to give a satisfactory return, will flock to the area now to be irrigated, and if the Government will le ram iom establishing on the plain Circassians or Bosnians, who are averse to settled and continuous agricultural labour, and will establish the laborious rvffV, laU ' wo * !vll ?a Moslems from Roumelia, Bulgaria, or Bessarabia, the success ot the undertaking is assured.

In other words, the Goyernraent will pay for the double line, and the advantage will only be reaped when the cost is amortized.* 3. The decision to double the share capital of the Anatolian Railway Company was taken at a general meeting on the 28th Jane, 1907. This decision was sanctioned by Imperial Irade, and entails a modification of Article 6 of the Statutes. The words ' de moitie ' are replaced by the words ' jusqu'a concurrence de 135,000,000 fr.' Article 6 of the Statutes is as follows ' Le fonds social est compose du capital a actions ci-apres determine et des obligations a emettre selon le cout des travaux des lignes. Le capital a actions est fixe a 1,800.000^., ou 36,720,000 marks ou45,000,000 fr., divise en 90,000 actions de 20/., 408 marks ou 500 fr. chacune. II pourra etre augmente de raoitie par TAssemblee Generale' As stated above, the words ' de moitie ' are replaced by the wordsjusqu'a, concurrence de 135,000,000 fr.' The 90,000 shares, viz., nominal capital of 45,000,000 fr., as above mention ed, constitute the capital created in shares of first series, liable, as stated, to be increased by one half, namely, by 22,500,000 fr. In 1893, on the occasion of the construction of the Eski-Chehir Konia line, of this sum of 22,500,000 fr., there was an issue of a nominal capital of 15,000,000 fr. (respresenting 30,000 shares) under the denomination of second series. In 1903, at the time of the construction of the Bagdad line, the Anatolian Railway Company issued the remaining balance of the sum of 22,500,000 fr., (namely, 7,500,000 fr ) under the denomination of third series, in order (1) to participate in the Bagdad Concession by a purchase of shares in that Company ; (2) to participate in the Haider Pasha Port Company; and (3) to take a share in the Construction Company of the Bagdad Railway. Thus the nominal capital of the Anatolian Railway Company, of which the original capital issued was by this time increased by half, was sub-divided as follows :— Nomiual Capital. Fr. 90,000 shares of 500 fr., first series ... 45,000,000 30,000 shares of 500 fr., second series... 15,0o0,000 15,000 shares of 500 fr., third series 7,500,000 Total 67,500,000 This nominal capital is again now doubled by the decision of tne general meeting of the 28th June, 1907, as above stated. Only 60 per cent of the original nominal capital was called up. It was deemed impossioie to ca f • Until tbe capital is amortized the smonnt of the kilometnc grantees ^ be P a 9 00 J- r) sinc e the average tithes collected by the Debt Council will be greater than it .s to-day (say oy £1. 9.000. a year;, receipts of ten years are less thau what they now are by about that araouut.

In any case, they probably imposed some conditions which they will endeavour to enforce when the time comes. £ T. The surplus of the ceded revenues is pledged to the Ottoman Bank to the amount of ... &gt;4&gt; ^ 676 330 The Germans have now to receive ... ... 200^000 Total ... 876,230 Plus interest at 7 per cent. This, in all probability, will not be paid off until 1911, but if any loan operation is undertaken by the Germans for the purpose of the construction of further sections of the Bagdad Eailway secured on the Government's share in tbe surplus of the ceded revenues, these advances may be funded or incorporat ed in such new loan. The Germans have therefore been allowed by the bank to obtain for tbe first time a material lien on the surplus of the ceded revenues; they will never relinquish it. I question whether the bank has acted wisely. I am told by the Director-General of the Ottoman Bank that the bank has as much as £T. 2,000,000 to receive from various departments of the State. (M. Constans puts the figure at 56,000^000 fr.) This may be so, but, to my knowledge, from the ceded revenues and ' revenus divers ' of the Debt Administration, the Ottoman Bank, apart from fixed assignments, has still to receive for various advances £T. 926,230 (£T. 676,230 advanced on the security of the surplus of the ceded revenues, and £T. 250,000 on the security of the surplus of the tithes collected by the Debt Administration,' plus interest at 7 per cent.) The Germans, to my knowledge, have to receive from the Government £T. 830,000, made up as follows :— Deutsche Bank secured on customs ... Deutsche Orient Bank secured on the receipts o£ the military equipment chest ... ••• ••• •** Deutsche Bank (Anatolian Railway Company) secured on the surplus ot' the ceded revenues «•' ••• £T. 40,000 on the Agricultural Bank Total ••• Plus interest at 7 per cent. The Ottoman Bank seems to be somewhat pertorhcd at seeins^the Germans coming again to the assistance of the Government. ^ U the ceded Director in Paris, has told me ho hoped to reserve the o£ r ^® ^^ revenues for a loan operation which ® s ha ° e now obtained a continues its present financial policy, and the viei lien on the surplus of the ceded revenues. ^ The Turkish Government is far from satisfied policy of restricting their credit in cider ,00 a o ™ emment are not displeased would rather not grant ; at the same timM ^ . g ^ evident at seeing the German banks supplanting the Ottoman .bai ^ £T. 800,000 300,000 200,000 40,000 840,0006 r that the Germans, 'by easing the strain, have rendered M. Constans' task of obtaining the Heraclea Coal Concession more difficult whilst strengthening their hold on the finances of the country, and especially on the surplus of the ceded revenues. They have in the last few months shown that they intend to prosecute their policy of financing and developing the country with energy and persis tence. When their hold on the surplus revenues of the dehfc is assured, as it will be, the Germans may take a stronger line in the Debt Administration ; and it is consoling at any rate to think that it is most improbable that they will toler ate any attempt of the Turkish Government to repudiate their engagements to the bondholders ; on the contrary they will strive to extend the control of the Debt Administration. The French have the largest holding in the Turkish External Debt, but should the surplus of the ceded revenues pass into the hands of the Germans they will be equally or more interested in the efficient and untrammelled administration of the ceded revenues, and when a control of Turkish finances become inevitable there is little doubt but that Germany will play a leading role. It is only fair to the Germans to add, in conclusion, that, whilst they are increasing their stake in the country and promoting their economic and financial interests, they are, as far as the Konia irrigation scheme at any rate is con cerned, finding money for an enterprise which cannot fail to be of great benefit to the population and agricultural interests of the country, and which, if successfully executed, will lead to a large increase in the revenues of the district, thus to a certain extent alleviating the financial straits of the Govern ment. I am reliably informed that owing to the imperative demands for baksheesh which have to be conceded, the profit on the construction of the irrigation works will be very small if any at all. The profit to the Germans will be in the increase to the railway receipts ; this will also alleviate the burden of the kilometric guarantees, and to that extent will benefit to Ottoman Treasury, The increased receipts are estimated to reach £T. 60,000 per annum.

My dear Hardinge, With regard to the Memorandum I sent you concerning the Konia Irriga tion scheme, etc., I wish to elucidate two points, 0 1. It would appear from my Memorandum that the area to he brought under cultivation is only 80,000 deunums. The 80,000 deunums are the area brought under cultivation by the draining of the lake of Karaviran. Besides this, it is expected that by the canalization of the rivers an area of over 500,000 deunums will be brought under cultivation, thus makino in all over 680,000 deunums. 0 2. With regard to the advances made to the Government by the Bank and stated to be over 50,000,000 fr. (£T. 2,200,000), I find in the last published balance sheet of the Bank (31st August, 1907) that the GovernmeDt owes them £T. 2,080,964. But it must be borne in mind that, according to the Convention between the Bank and the Government, the former is obliged to open a credit account for the latter of £T. 1,000,000. To this I add the £T. 926,230 whic h the Bank has yet to receive from sums advanced on the security of revenues in the hands of the Debt. The balance, namely, £T. 154,734 are other sums advanced by the Bank to the Civil List, etc., of which I know no details. But the Bank is by no means in any danger on this account, either as regards capital or interest. Eirst to cover the credit account of £T. 1,000,000 the Government has delivered to the Bank 50,000 bonds of the 1904 4 per cent. Loan, to the nomi - nal value of 1,000,000^. At the rate of to-day this is worth £T. 1,000,000, so that the £T. 1,000,000 to the credit of the Government is fully covered. Secondly, eventual reimbursement of the sums advanced on the security of the revenues in the hands of the Debt (ceded revenues and 'revenus divers ') is absolutely assured. There only remains then £T. 154,734, the reimbursement of which may be problematical, but I imagine the Bank has no fears on this account. Again, the advances to the Government are at 7 per cent., and the interest also is assured in the first two cases. Eor the £T. 1,000,000 by the annuity of £T. 108,000, which the Public Debt pays as a fixed charge on the surplus of the ' revenus divers This £T. 108,000 is applied as follows:— £T. Interest, 7 per cent, on £T. 1 ,000,000 ... 70,000 Annual subvention paid by Government to Bank for the maintenance of Agencies ... ... ... 82,000 152,000 Less the coupon on the 50,000 bonds of the 1904 loan above mentioned in the bands of the Bank, namely... ... 44,000 Total 108,000and for the sums advanced on the security of revenues, in the hands of the Debt, there is no fear of the interest not forthcoming. The Bank then appears to me to be in a sound position, both as regards capital and interest, of at any rate £T. 1,926,230 of its advances, and for the small remainder I am sure the Bank is fully secure. From the above, when it is remembered that 7 per cent, is the interest paid by the Government, it is clear that the Bank is doing a profitable busi ness with the Government, and the greater part of its advances may be consi. dered as a very fair investment of a large portion of its paid-up share capital. It is not risking much. I am, etc., ADAM BLOCK. 2 Q. C.B, P., Simla,—No. C*114P. D.—4-5'OS,—SO—J.

Sir, During the discussion of the Foreign Office Estimates in tlie Budget Com mittee of the Reichstag yesterday, Herr Erzberger inquired of the Foreign Secretary as to the present position of the Bagdad Railway, and as to the manner in which it was affected by the Anglo-Russian Agreement. Herr von Schon replied that the Bagdad Railway and the Anglo-Russian Agreement had nothing to do with one another. The Agreement between the two Powers regarding Thibet, Afghanistan, and Persia deals only with commercial interests. Germany is only interested in the commercial development of Persia. The Contracting Powers have disclaimed any intention of interfering with the rights of other Powers. In the Treaty, ' equal opportunities in commercial matters for all nations ' is expressly laid down. The Bagdad Railway is, by the Sultan's concession, a Turkish undertaking with a German character. The extension of the line depends upon the ability of the Turkish Government to pay the kilometric guarantee of 16,500 marks per kilometre. Germany is entirely uninfluenced by political motive in the construction of this railway. She only wishes to reopen an ancient land to civilization, and to unlock fresh doors lor trade and industry. That she has any aspirations towards colonization is pure fancy. Although foreign capital must be employed in the construction of the railway, the German character of the undertaking will be always main tained. j have, &amp;c. FRANK C. LASCELLES.

Mr. G. Barclay to Sir Edward Orey.—{Received April 13,) (No. 171. Confidential.) J?era s April 7th. 190S. Sir, Referring to my telegram No 83 of the 3rd instant, in which I reported that I was informed on private but reliable authority that the German Ambas sador was pressing for the prolongation of the Bagdad Railway, I now have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a Memorandum which has since been furnished me by my informant. As you are aware, the surplus of the ceded revenues, which is looked to as security for the neoessary construction loan, was at the end of last year already pledged well into 19 iO Since then Sir Nicholas O'Conor has reported a further charge upon it of £ T. 200,000 as security for a loan made to the Government by the Anatolian Railway Company, and quite recently this charge has been increased by a further £ T. 100,000. I do not know how it is proposed to clear off these charges so as to free the surplus for the purpose now in view. A notice in the Turkish press which appeared two or three days ago to the effect that the Anatolian Railway Company had applied to the Minister of Public Works for the extension of the Bagdad Railway to Aleppo afforded me a favourable opportunity for delivering the hint indicated in your telegram No. 66 of the 4th instant. I conveyed the message yesterday to the Grand Vizier, who, in his reply, confirmed my information that he was opposed to the prolongation of the railway. As regards the Macedonian deficit, his Highness said that, if the proceeds of the 3 per cent surtax came up to expectations, the deficit would gradually be cleared off in the natural course. This is no doubt true if the next two or three years show favourable customs receipts, but the outlook for the current year is not promising, as the depression following the recent commercial crisis is likely to react for some time on the import trade. The hint given the Grand Vizier will of course reach the Sultan, and it should strengthen his Highness' hands in resisting the German demands. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Inclosure in No. 1.

These temporary charges in themselves need not, of course, prove an insuperable obstacle to the surplus being used for a railway loan. They could be funded, or a formal undertaking on the part of the Ottoman Government ear-marking it for the Bagdad Railway, after the present floating charges have been paid off, would doubtless satisfy the Railway Company. What is, however, somewhat remarkable, is that the extension of the railway should be mooted at a time when the Berlin market is under the strain of large impending loans. It would seem as though the Railway Company need not depend for funds exclusively on Berlin. In the course of conversation on the 11th instant the Grand Vizier again assured me that he was opposed to the hypothecation of the surplus of the ceded revenues for the Bagdad Railway, and that he would do his utmost to prevent it. I have no doubt as to his Highness' sincerity on this point, as the surplus is a most convenient security for advances when the financial strain becomes more than usually acute, and it would naturally be very distasteful to the Porte to see it permanently tied up. At the same time there is no doubt that the Sultan is anxious to see the railway extended as far as Aleppo so as to establish through connection with the Hedjaz. It will not have escaped your notice that in the Memor mdum forwarded in my despatch No. 171, it is stated that if the railway is only to be prolonged as far as Aleppo, the Company demands an increase in the construction kilome- tric guarantee to 13,500 fr., or £ T. 2,500 more than that provided for by their Convention.
