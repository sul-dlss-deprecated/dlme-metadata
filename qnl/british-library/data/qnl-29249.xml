Local Ooinion News of the successes on the Albanian and Egyptian fronts has had a heartening effect ahd the Italians have sunk still further in popular estimation. 136. Trucial Coast (i) On the 20th November the Shaikh of Dubai issued an order to his people forbidding -them from going out at night after 3 O’clock Arabic (about 9 p.m.) It appears that the Shaikh of the Awamir met Shaikh Jumah, the Ruler 1 s brother, and told him that he had seen some wandering Bedus who said that they had been given rifles by Shaikh Mana'. Shaikh Jumah at once concluded that an attack from Bahrain, where Shaikh Mana' is at present, was imminent and hence the curfew. (ii) About the 15th November, Shaikh Ahmad of Diba Hisin complained to Shaikh Humaid, the nephew of Shaikh Khalid, the Regent of Kalba, that the Shahdh of Bai’ah (Diba) were interfering in his internal affairs. Shaikh Humaid sent 50 men to reinforce the guard at Dxfesra: Diba and advised Shaikh Ahmad to consult Shaikh Khalid who was then at Ajman. After Shaikh Ahmad had left for Ajman, the Shahuh started felling and destroying trees in the Hisin area; the Hisin garrison fired at them in retaliation and generally tension between the two parties increased and there was sniping day and night and both sides sustained some casualties. When the trouble first broke out the Shahuh requested the Shaikh of Dubai for some ammunition but he refused to give them any saying that he himself was in need of all his supplies. But he advised Shaikh Humaid and the Shaikh of the Shahuh to cease hostilities promising to go himself to Diba to settle their differences. Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Ruler of Sharjah, had a secret meeting v/ith Shaikh Khalid and it is rumoured gave 2000 rounds of ammunition for use against the Shahuh. The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah who was also invited to this meeting excused himself. Shaikh Khalid left Ajman for Kalba on the 30th November and the latest reports indicate that the trouble at Diba has been settled except that the defences newly erected by Diba as a result of the recent disturbances may remain as they are.f Jr. a-ti m 137.

It is gathered from members of his party that a plot which had as its object the overthrow of the Saudi regime had been dis covered. It is said that three important members of the Cairo where, they mat Amir Abdullah who was then on a visit f° Egypt. Afte.t this meeting they returned to Mecca and pro ceeded to hold secret meetings in the course of which they invited Sharif Hazza-. an influential member of the Sharifian family and a pro-Saudi to join them. It appears that he was unwilling to do this and only yielded under threats. However, having seen their papers and plans he at once proceeded at midnight to Amir Faisal and reported the matter. Amir Feisal immediately sent out a police force to arrest the conspirators and it was only after some shots had been exchanged and three of them killed that the remainder were arrested. Some of the police also were injured. It is understood that from the documents discovered a number of other persons were found to be implicated in the plot and that the conspirators were well financed. Some of them were residents of Has a and orders have been issued for the arrest of them all. There was a rumour current also that about 3000 persons were intending to gather at Mecca disguised as pilgrims with the object of staging a coup d : etat at the time of Amir Abdullah’s presence on Haj - The above events are being kept very quiet by the Saudj. Government and it is said that Ibn Saud has requested foreign powers not to give them publicity as it might prevent per s o ns i rcm proceeding on pilgrimage and thus affect the finances of the state- pilots, said to cation with the (yii) It has also been widely reported that some Saudi were found to be in communi- alians and to be receiving funds from Bagh- ;0 six in numoe: 4- dad.

At about 3.15 a.m. two or possibly three machines approached Bahrain from a westerly direction and after circling over the refinery at a height between two and three thousand feet dropped salvos of bombs, a number of which failed to explode. Some 84 homos were dropped, all of them of small calibre. They fell very wide of the target and there were no casualties and no damage was done. Bombs were dropped on the Oil Field of the Cali fornia Arabian Standard Oil Company at Bharan, Saudi Arabia, the same morning, probably by the same enemy aircraft. There were no casualties, but slight damage was done to an oil and a water pipeline. The possibility of an air attack having been considered to be extremely remote, the defence of the Oil Refinery against saboteurs depended largely on the illumination of the perimeter with powerful lights. These could not be switched off before the first salvo of bombs had been dropped. The target must have been of the type longed for by pilots of bombing aircraft - perfectly defined, brilliantly illuminated, and without defence* Why the refinery was not hit is beyond com prehension. 318, Loca l Opinion It was at first thought by the Arab population that the raid in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia was ”staged ,r by the British with a view to inciting Arab opinion against the Italians, creating complications between the Saudi Government and the Italians and further rousing the Americans. But disillusionment followed when the Italian and German broadcasts made their usual exaggerated claims of damage done in Bahrain. The facts that the attack was made during the month of Ramadhan and that no hits were scored on so obvious a target which was without any form of protec tion against aircraft, have caused contempt for the Italians to greatly increase. !L9. Trucial Coast Affairs On his recent visit to King Ibn Saud, Shaikh Said bin Maktum, Ruler of Dubai, seems to have been very much impressed by the King* s attitude towards His Majesty’s Government. Speaking about the v/ar in general Ibn Saud /■- 3 - » Ibn Saud is said to have told Shaikh Said that it was but rumours should be spread by interested persons, ut he 5 Ibn, Saud, had had dealings with the British for a very long time and knew them well.

'My advice to you and the people on your side is not to listen to or believe any rumour about other foreign non-Muslim powers. Such isad:- xxg rumours are misleading and you should be on your watch not to accept them ,, . The same views were given to Shaikh Said by other members of the Saudi family, particularly by Amir Muhammad bin Abdur Rahman, Ibn Saud* s brother. This has had a very good effect on Shaikh Said and in Dubai generally 120. Meteorological Maximum temperature .. 99,2° on the 16th October. Minimum temperature .. 70.6° on the 29th October.

Trucial Coast . A report from Sharjah states that Majid bin Khalfan, assisted by some of the Shuwaihat of Bani Ka’ab, attacked Hatta, a village at which he was for- merly the Shaikh of Dubai’s representative. He made prisoners of the present representative and two others and took possession of some of the weaker forts. A force of 60 men, led by Shaikh Maktum bin Jum'ah, was despatched from Dubai to help the Hatta defenders, and it is reported that 10 men and 40 camels were detained, pending final settlement. 105. Local Af fairs • Shaikh Said bin Maktum of Dubai recently pass ed through Bahrain on his way to visit Ibn Saud. Ibn Saud evidently spoke to him about the distressful quarrel that continues to divide Bahrain and Qatar and, according to a letter from Shaikh Said to His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain, he invited Shaikh Said to try his hand at a reconciliation between the two States. A less promising arbitrator could scarcely have been chosen. The Bahrain Shaikhs re gard Said as a poor fish and the Shaikh of Qatar has an equally low opinion of him. Said went to Qatar and wrote to the Shaikh of Bahrain that he would address him again after talking over the matter with the Shaikh of Qatar. No letter has arrived and the episode can now be written off. Ibn Saud has for a long time been anxious to see Bahrain and Qatar on better terms but seems to have no constructive ideas about how to fix it. A good many people on both sides will have to pass on to another world before Bahrain and Qatar are really friendly again. Fortunately it is a matter of lit tle practical importance. 106. Public Opinion The pact between the Axis and Japan seems to have impressed local public opinion rather more than it should have done. The local view seems to be that it will keep America quiet and may well inter fere with her material aid to Great Britain. 107.

POk* OEPt. 940 indja office it /-2 It is now generally known in Bahrain that/an Italian submarine was sunk somewhere near the entrance to the Persian Gulf and that prisoners taken from the submarine were brought to Bahrain and later sent to India. The secret was kept remarkably well v/hile they were here. The bazaar is busy recounting exciting stories of operations against Italian submarines. One of. the best is that British warships are now fitted with glass bottoms in order to see the enemy and with a powerful grappling device by which the skulking foe is seized and lifted to the surface for destruction. It is an interesting fact that we receive little credit from the Arabs for suecess €S against the Italians. The common attitude is that it would be very astonishing indeed if we did not beat up these despicable dagoes.

Trucial Coast (i) Reference paragraph 65 of my Intelligence Summary No.10 of 1940. On the 27th May the Shaikh of Sharjah sent a verbal message to Shaikh Abdur Rahman of Hira ap prising him of the agreement between Sharjah and Dubai to boycott Hira and calling on him to stop Hira people going to Sharjah. In reply Shaikh Abdur Rah man sent a written note to the Shaikh of Sharjah saying that if the Shaikh of Sharjah interfered with the movements of any of his people he would kill the elite of Sharjah. The Shaikh of Sharjah then tried to induce the Shaikh of Dubai to agree that the other Trucial Shaikhs should be invited to k® join in the boycott of Hira and, if they refused, to extend the boycott to them. Shaikh Said naturally rejected this childish plan, and said that he had not the least ob jections to Hira carrying on normal business with Sharjah^ his only stipulation was that the Auwlad Rashid and the Auwlad Bati should not go to Sharjah. Meanwhile Shaikh Abdur Rahman is trying to come to some arrangement with the Shaikh of Dubai about the Dubai refugees in Hira and he has enlisted the support of the Shaikhs of Umm al Qaiwain and Kimriyah. The Shaikh of Sharjah is unable to prevent the Aulad Ra shid and Bati from frequenting Sharjah and he has in vited Shaikh Said of Dubai to attack them. (ii) There has been a mild outbreak of anti- British feeling in Sharjah, for which the Shaikh 1 s Secretary Abdullah bin Paris is largely responsible.

(a) The New Deed modifying the old lease of 29th September 1934 and granting a concession for the whole of Bahrain to the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited was signed on the 19th June 1940 in the presence of the Political Agent. The conclusion of this long-dragged out affair gave much satisfaction to His Highness and his Family. (b) The news of the final surrender of France had a less disturbing effect on the local population than might have been expected. There is much anxiety about the fate of the French fleet and the future of the French North African possessions and Syria, but a large part of the intelligent public still puts its faith in British sea power and Britain’s growing strength in the air.^9 2 'fmm The British community 5 its nerves somewhat i 1 rayed by the recent extraordinary broadcasts fif the still waits anxiously to know what it will be allowed to do about this war, (c) Bahrain is growing more and more puzzled about how it should communicate with England. The British Overseas Airways Corporation recently announced that it would carry mails by air to Durban whence they would be conveyed by sea to England, The Post Office, under the instructions of the Posts and Telegraphs Department in India, prompty announced that it would accept no air mails for England whether by Durban or by any other route. Meanwhile news has been received that the public in Cairo have been advised to 'post early in the week' in order to catch a direct air service between Egypt and England. Bahrain’s difficulties are accentuated by the fact that the fast mhil to and from India is withdrawn at the last mofnent with monotonous per sistence each week. Even the slow mail was inter rupted for several days but in this instance the public derived considerable pleasure from noting that its restoration coincided with an Admiralty broadcast announcement that Italian submarines had been sunk east of Suez. 76.

His Royal Highness the Amir Saud arrived here from India by special plane on the evening of the 8th June, very much improved in health. He was received at the aerodrome by Shaikhs Abdullah and Salman, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and the Assistant Political Agent, the Political Agent being absent from Bahrain. His Highness the Shaikh met the Amir at the end of the causeway and took him to the Palace. On the evening of the 9th June the Amir was entertained by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. He left Bahrain for A1 Khobar by launch on the 10th. While here he expressed his gratitude for the assistance given go him by the Government of India.. 70. Local Affairs (i) The news of Italy : s entry into war was greeted in Bahrain with expressions of contempt and hatred for the Italians whose barbarities in Tripoli and Abyssinia are remembered. Subsequent news of the virtual defeat of France has confused the people, though at present their main interest is to hear about the future of French possessions in Northern Africa and Syria. The news had an electrifying effect on British residents of Manama and employees of the Oml Company. This development has been reported separately. (ii) The first Bahrain subject to see war at close quarters is Shaikh Mohammad bin 5 Isa. brother of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain. Very unwisely he boarded an Italian ship from Alexandria on the 5th June to proceed to Beirut — and the ship went straight to Italy. News was then received that Shaikh Mohammad had arrived at Malta, whence he sent an ingenuous telegram saying that he was unable to find any means of proceeding home and would His Highness the Shaikh please arrange ? The Family has sent a reply urging him to ,f keep out of danger areas™. 71. Qatar Reference paragraph 64 of my Intelligence Summary No. 10 of 1940.

RECo.rOL.DEPT. • | 10JUN 940 ' j! 1 WDIA OFFICE *~ 2 - in the presence of a large gathering of Arab and European ladies. (ii) The surrender of the Belgian Army and the evacuation of British and French troops from Dunkirk have had a depressing effect on public opinion. Some of the foreign elements in Bahrain appear to have con vinced themselves that the British will soon be forced to leave Bahrain and both the Holis (Bahrain-born people of Persian origin) and some of the Nejdis have been discussing (separately) whose protection should be sought when the British go. Naturally the thoughts of each party turn to its own country of irigin. A section of the Holis and other more recent Persian immigrants have been rather too free in expres sing their pleasure at German successes, but though they have succeeded in causing some despondency in the towns and will need to be dealt with, they have also produced desirable reactions in sharpening the dislike and distrust of themselves which is shared by the Shaikhs, the town Arabs and the Bahama. 62* Oil An extraordinary report was received on the 20th May from the Master of the S.S. 'Barpeta” (un fortunately after the ship had sailed from Bahrain) that he had passed a large quantity of oil in the sea about 15 miles North East of Halul Island. The existence of a wide oil patch was confirmed by Royal Air Force aircraft and further enquiries made from the S.S. 'Barpeta” in Basra elicited the information that the oil was welling up as though from a submarine n gusher :r forming a mushroom 3’ in diameter and 2 s 6 ,,M high. It is unfortunate that the Barpeta did not pick up a few bucketfuls of this oil and bring them to Bahrain for test. Owing to other preoccupations it has not yet been feasible to arrange a fuller investigation on the surface but this will be done as soon as possible. 63 . Saudi Arabia The somewhat ill-conceived project for the cons truction of a 25,000 barrel Refinery at Has Tanura is not quite such a certainty as it seemed to be. At any rate the despatch of construction material from America has been held up pending further consideration. 64 * Qatar It is reported that a squabble occurred on the 30th May between minor members of the Oasim and Ahmad sections of the Qatar Shaikhly family. Shaikh Hamad, the heir-apparent, tried to turn this into a major issue and demanded that the Ahmad party should bither be /-be disarmed or deported. The Shaikh of Qatar held a meeting at which there was a good deal of excitement, but it seems probable that the whole matter has been settled without recourse to drastic action, though this remains tobe confirmed. Shaikh Hamad’s attitude was probably influenced by difficulties following the distribution (or more likely the non-distribution) of the oil money which was paid by the Company on the 17th May. 65. Trucial Coast Reference paragraph 49 of my Intelligence Summary No. 8 of 1940. The Shaikh of Dubai has been pressing his demands on the Shaikh of Sharjah to turn the Auwlad Rashid out of his town and also to force the Shaikh of Hira to turn the Auwlad Bati out of Hira. After a good deal of talk the Auwlad Rashid, with the exception of Shaikh Mana’s family, moved to Hira and t his was followed by an agreement between the Shaikhs of Dubai and Sharjah to ’’boycott” Hira until both the Rashid and Bati families are forced to leave. The Shaikh of Sharjah has always claimed that Hira is under his suzerainty but is far too pusillanimous in character and weak in armed strength to enforce this claim. Although the agreement between the Shaikhs of Dubai and Sharjah has resulted in the road between the two towns being reopened to traffic and in a general easing of tension, it is highly improbable that it will have any effect on the Shaikh of Hira’s expressed determination to keep the Rashid and Bati families in his town.. 66.

Visit of Arab Notables Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid, Ruler of Ajman, arrived here on the 5th May on a friendly visit to the Shaikh of Bahrain.2 Shaikh Rashid called on the Political Agent on the.15th. He excused himself for being so late in paying his call on the ground that he had heard the Political Agent was very busy. • Local Affairs (i) The immense interest which is now being taken in female education in Bahrain was well exemplified on the 11th May when the Muharraq Girls T School had its Prize Distribution and gave a play. About 500 ladies had been invited and arrangements were made for the control of traffic round the approaches to the School by Police and Nature. The ladies however were far too much for the Police. Uninvited guests arrived in scores and mere men were powerless to cope with them. One lady of more than usually noble pro portions was observed hurling the puny Police from her path while shepherding into the School a large party of friends and relatives who wanted to see the show. In fact a thoroughly pleasant afternoon was enjoyed by all, except possibly by Her Highness the Shaikha and some of the European guests who prefer less strenuous entertainment. (ii) Reference paragraph 33 (ii) of my Intelligence Summary No. 6 of 1940. Although agitation had subsided the women who live in the circles in which orders had been given for the closure of private surface wells decided to take a hand in this matter. They gave their menfolk 24 hours in which to see*the Political Agent’s inter vention, and when the men failed to a ct the women themselves descended on the Agency. When order was restored they were invited to state their grievances, and they put forward one or two very telling points. This demonstration coincided with the Political Agent 1 s final conviction, as the result of certain experiments recently carried out, that the Bahrain Statels scheme for a public water supply in Manama had been framed on meagre and inadequate lines and that the old theory that an effective sewage and drainage system could not be introduced except at prohibitive cost was unsound. Meetings were accordingly held and plans are now to be prepared for a real public water supply and for proper drainage. In order to tie in with such a scheme the six circles in which surface wells are to be filled in have now been reduced to a radius of 200 feet. Meanwhile constant care will be taken to ensure the suuply of larvicidal fish in shallow wells in the rest of the Town. 55.

But when the steamer arrived in Sharjah, the Shaikh of Sharjah sent only Rs 60/- to Mana' who seemed to have been expecting at least a first class passage to Bombay plus some thing more to meet incidental expenses.

The Amir 3aud was as charming as ever and expressed his and Ibn Saud’s gratitude for the arrange ments made by the Government of India. He referred also to their strong sympathy for the Allies' cause. 48. Local Affairs His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain has had a dream in which he saw himself sending telegrams of congratulation to His Majesty, to the Prime Minister and to Mr. Churchill and Mr. Eden on the successful conclusion of the war. The dream is not without pro paganda value, especially at a time when the B.B.C. is failing signally to counter the combined German - Italian broadcast offensive. 49.

On his return to Sharjah, Mana was sent a verbal message by the Shaikh of Sharjah to the effect that he must find some other place for his family. Shaikh Mana intends to send them to Hamasa for the summer.

The party was met by the Political Agent, the Senior Laval Officer, Persian Gulf, Shaikh Abdullah, Shaikh Salman and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and lunched at Shaikh Abdullah’s house near the aerodrome. His Highness the Shaikh was indisposed that day. They again passed through Bahrain on the 7th April on their way back to Iraq, their mission having been a great success* Nuri Pasha, who had been glum and pre-occupied on the outv/ard journey, was now smiling and cheerful. He had been greatly surprised to find that Ibn Saud was so well informed about affairs in Europe and had been mueh impressed by his reading of events. Mutual suspicions had been dissipated and each seemed to have acquired a considerable respect for the other. Items of importance in the negotiations have been reported by telegram. (ii) Shaikh Hafiz Wahba does not share the vi§w expressed by the Amir Saud in Kuwait that Mr. Philby is an advocate of peace. Indeed his comments were rather too forceful to be repeated here, except for the following story s- Mr. Philby had taken some care to warn everyone in the King’s Camp against Squadron Leader Domvile (who was in charge of the Royal Air Force ground party) who he said was a British spy and a Shaitan.

The conduct of the peace between Duoai ana Sharjali has involved everyone in far* greater activity than did the | conduct of the war, and all parties have maintained their f high reputation for double-crossing and cowardice. The Shaikh of Sharjah is now anxious again to get rid of Shaikh Mana but is afraid to tell him so to his face $ Shaikh Mana would like to leave but is insistent on obtaining a guaranteed allowance from the Shaikh of Dubai* At the moment he is at Abu Dhabi having been taken there in a Sharjah launch the pilot of which had secret orders to abandon him at Abu Dhabi and to return at once to Sharjah. The following is a typical story of the Trucial Coast. On the 22nd March the Shaikh of Sharjah met the Shaikh of Dubai and said that he proposed to send his Secretary to Dubai for a friendly discussion of future action. That night the Secretary arrived in Dubai with no message of importance but said that he had a tin of nails in a house in Dubai which he would like to take back to Sharjah. Would the Shaikh of Dubai give him a permit to take it without its being subjected to the usual examination ? Shaikh Said gave him the permit but at the same time sent one of his men to stop the Secretary on the outskirts of Daira, to ignore the permit and to search the tin. This was done and it was found to contain a few nails on the top and four hundred rounds of ammunition below.

Highness still in considerable confusion as to the ✓ ' identity of his distinguished visitor. The Minister left for A1 Khobar on the 27th whence he intended to travel by land to Kuwait. 33. Local Affairs (i) In the last wo or three years some of the younger members of the Shaikhly Family, though not , the sons of Shaikh Hamad himself, have caused considerable scandal by their drunkenness. After a good deal of encouragement His Highness was induced to promise that if they continued to be drunk and disorderly he [would deal very firmly with them, and this promise has now been put into effect in one case. Shaikh Ali, son of His Highness' brother Shaikh Abdullah, indulged jin a particularly revolting drunken bout a few days ago and has now been banished for an indefinite period to Hawar. The pleasures of Hawar are confined to watching a fev; fishermen gut their catch, and the result of this action should be admirable. (ii) Among other steps being taken to reduce malaria in Manama the Anti-Malaria Committee have decided to arrange for the closing of all shallow wells in compounds within 200 yards of public artesian crater supplies. Certain persons appear to have seen in this an opportunity to cause difficulties for the Bahrain Government and some small agitstion began recently, designed to induce householders to believe that the Government's object was to sell them drinking water. The Shia ex-Qadhi Shaikh Abdullah is believed to have been mainly responsible for this and although it has not been possible to prove anything definite against him he is now under close surveillance. Mean while the Bahrain Government have been advised to make use of the present Shia and Sunni Oadhis and of news paper and other propaganda to remove this false imp ression, and latest reports indicate that ill-feeling has subsided. It may be noted that these shallow wells have been used solely for water for washing, that /-No. 5 of 1940 (i) T.V.

Negotiations have been proceeding durin| the fortnight for Shaikh Mans and the majortiy of his party to find a permanert home at Hamasah in the Baraimi Oasis, as the iqs of the A1 Bu Shalmis Shaikh Rashid bin Hamad. After the inevitable maze of duplicity, suspicion and intrigue had been duly traversed, the requisite pledges have been signed. Shaikh Mana and his party are now visiting Sharjah — under the protection of the brothers of the Al Bu Shamis Shaikh and of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, and with the consent of Shaikh Said of Dubai — to arrange about the removal of their women folk and the disposal of their property. It is a point of interest, indicating the dominant position held by Abu Dhabi in the Baraimi area, that the Al Bu ( shamis first obtained the approval of the Shaikh of r bu Dhabi I before agreeing to accept the Mana party at Hamasah.(ii) During 'the course of the recent Trucial Coast Cruise by H.M.S. Shoreham and H.M.S. Fowey, tv.o depth-charges were dropped between Kalba and Khor Fakkan. Shaikh Khalid* Regent of IClaba, was aboard H*M*S* Shoreham at the time, and the most astonishing stories are now going up an6 do^n the ^oast.

(i) The Agency flagstaff was dressed on the 8th June in honour of the Birthday of His ^ajesty the King Emperor. Calls were received from His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain, members of the A1 Khalifah family, and leading members of the India, Arab and Persian Communities. (if) On i.he 16th oune a meeting was held in the Bahrain Theatre under the presidency of Shaikh Abdullah binTsaaF Oialirah, with the object of collecting subscriptions for distressed Arab widows and orphans in Palestine. The amount collected and promised so far is some -,3.24,000. Unfortunately M-e fixst instalment ox ohis money was sent to SPiaikh Muhammad bin Isa in Alexandria for transmission to Abdul Hamid Said* in Cairo, is stc ted by the Embassy to be an undesirable. This was only discovered on the Political Agent* s return to Bahrain from the Irucial Coast and though efforts have been made to intercept the money, it is probably too late. The action of the Bahrain Committee in ignoring adivee to send the money wo the Arab omen*s Committee in Jerusalem is deplorable. 73. frucial Coast . (i) The continued stay in dharjah of Shaikh Mana and the Dubai refugee party and the Shaikh of Sharjah*s unwillingness to evict them from his town finally led the Shaikh of Dubai to threaten to attack Sharjah Town. Uncessful efforts were made to induce the Shaikh of ; bu Dhabi to permit the Refugees to live in his States and finally it was decided what the only ive ox any suosequent arrangements which might'be made for their/ ltheir permanent residence. The Shaikh of Dubai was induced to postpone his offensive for a week, and both the Shaikh of Sharjah and the Mana party were informed of the inevitable result of further procrastination. As usual the Shaikh of Has al Khaimsh intervened and added to the general intrigue and confusion, only however to find his mischief-making recoil on his own head. At che eleventh hour the Shaikh of Sharjah, convinced at last of the imminence of the danger, forcibly despatched four of the leading (and most dangerous) members of the kana party to Has al Khaimah under his brother's charge, withs triet orders to ensure that they stayed there whatever the Shaikh might say. (Sharjah and Has al Khaimah are cousins, and there is a strong party in Has al Khaimah in favour of admitting kana and his adherents.) The effect on Dubai - Sharjah relations was immediate. The two Shaikhs have been reconciled and normal trade and travel have been restored. (ii) A new Dispensary, financed by the Government of India, was opened in Dubai on the 9th June, under the charge of an Indian Moslem ^ub Assistant Surgeon. It is housed in an admirable building provided by the Shaikh of Dubai, and its. popularity can be judged by the fact that within 4 days of its opening the number of out-patients was close on 150. Avuendance figures will probably receive a temporary set-back while the Coast is assimilating the unpleasant truth that few diseases can be cured in five minutes. Dven so the stock of dru ;s provided for the year is unlikely to last more than four or five months.

His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad is stilx unwell and has been taken from his residence at Sakhir to one of the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s air-cooled houses which the Company were kind enough to place at his disposal. (ii) Three Bahrain fruit merchants received consignments of fruit from Muscat by the British India Steam Navigation Company’s S.3. ’’Bankura” on the 2nd July 1938 and these were duly cleared through the Customs. One basket of limes, how ever, remained unclaimed and had no marks on it. It was therefore treated as abandoned cargo, and on e xamination, about 2 lbs of charas, a Mauser magazine pistol and two clips of cartridges were found. Whether this consignment was ac-' tually meant for Bahrain or not remains a mystery, but some one has been unfortunate to the tune of about Rs. 2500/-. (iii) The California Arabian Standard Oil Company’s motor launch ’’Calarabia” while on its way from A1 Khobar to Bahrain on the 6th July caught fire, exploded and sank.

I applied to Air Head quarters, 'Iraq, for aircraft to assist in the search aid a flying boat arrived the following day. During the morning of the 7th July the American mechanic who had been in charge of the launch and two of the Arab crew were picked up in an exhausted condition after having been in the water for close on 24 hours with a shamal blowing. Two American passengers named Mr. and Mrs. Herring and two Arabs of the crew- were drowned and their bodies were not found until the morning of the 8th July. It was evident that both Mr. and Mrs. Herring had suffered bad burns when the launch burst into flames. 78. Qatar. There is a certain amount of trouble in the A1 Thani family of Qatar. The Shaikh complains that some of his rela tives have been encouraged by the Shaikh of Bahrain to come across to Bahrain where they are given money for the purpose of spreading hostile propaganda in Qatar. On the other hand these relatives have complained to me that the Shaikh of Qatar refuses to give them any share of the money he receives from Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited and that as their other sources of income have now disappeared they have nothing to live on. The Shaikh of Qatar has ignored a suggestion that it is not only incumbent on him but is also in £is own inte rests to make provision for his poorer relatives. 79/-Maximum temperature 106.2^ on 'the 13th and 14th July Minimum temperature 81.3 on the 1st July Humidity exceeded 70% on nine days.

(i) Three nakhudas of dhows have recently been arrested and heavily fined for attempting to bring indigent foreigners without passports into Bahrain. At the s ame time an ectensive round-up was made in the bazaars of Persians and Qatifis v/ho have been found here without passports and without any osten sible means of livelihood. Some 500 persons were detained for examination and though many of these were subsequently released, the Agency Court is now extremely busy dealing with the balance under King 1 s Begulation No. 2 of 1937. It is hoped that these operations, particularly the heavy fines on the nakhudas, will cause some considerable diminution in the number of indigent foreigners landing with out permission in Bahrain.

Even Shaikh Hamad, generous as he is, is getting extremely tired of these people and has besought my assistance in putting them off. He regretfully declined my suggestion that he might manage matters himself by return pre- ; sents of equally vYorn-out camels to his visitors. (iii) A fire occurred at No. 56 Well in the Bahrain Pet roleum Company^ Oil Field on the 17th April. This is a new M edge well” and a test had gust been made which resulted in a good deal of oil lying about the rig. By the most extraordina ry misfortune a spark from an engine just being started fired the oil-soaked clothing of a cooly, and while he himself was beirg extinguished in the mud-sump the fire spread to the der rick floor. It was hov/ever extinguished quite quickly and no serious damange was done. h 48. Trucial Coast . (i) Reference paragraph 29(i) of my Summary No. 5 of 1938. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has had the impertinence to en- Mu quire why he has been deprived of the good offices of His Majes ty's Government, and to enquire also what reasons we have for stating that slave trading goes on through his territories. || Since the latter enquiry appeared to indicate the intention more of suppressing informers than of slave traders, he has received the reply that since he is the Shaikh he presumably knows all that is going on in his Shaikhdom and that it is his business to put a speedy end to slave traffic. jl[\ (ii) Shaikh Khalid, the Regent of Kalba, seems to be doing fairly well for himself. One story, so far unconfirmed, is that he has managed to assert authority over quite a considerable stretch of Has al Khaimah territory in the Wadi al Kaur. The small Shaikh or Wali of South (independent) Diba also appears to recognise Kalba as his suzerain. It is a pity that Shaikh Khalid suffers so much from malarial 3 g (iii) Intensive patrolling and dhow searching on the Tru cial and Batineh Coasts by the three sloops now in the Gulf have resulted in a crop of rumours. One of them, which has been reproduced in a Baghdad nev/spaper (and v/hich I hope will appeal to the sloops) is that an entire British fleet is now in the Persian Gulf. Another, which is interesting as indicat ing^ the present trend of thought on the Coast, is that the Abu Dhabi andRas al Khaimah pearling fleets are to be seized. 49. Saudi Arabia .

The object of the seismic tests is to locate li Kely subsunace structures where there are few surface expo sures to assist. I understand that the California Arabian Standard/-/ -3- Standard Oil Company believe that they have located a very hopeful structure, and that test drilling in this area will be undertaken when equipment can be released from Dhamman* (ii) Shaikh Hafiz Wahaba, Saudi Arabian Minister in London, passed through Bahrain by air on the 30th April en route to Japan where he is going to attend, on behalf of King Ibn Saud, the opening ceremony of a Moslem Mosque in Japan* 50* Meteorological * Maximum temperature •. 99*5® on the 28th April.

I visited Hawar Island on the 15th April and inspected the new Bahrain Police Post there. The fact that no complaint : has been received from the Shaikh of Qatar v/hile this very solid building was under construction is an interesting omis sion, apparently indicating his acceptance of Bahrain 1 s rights in Hawar. 41.

(ii) On the 8th April 1938, thefShaikh of Has al Khaimah , wrote to the Residency Agent, Sharjah, requesting him to issue a Certificate of Identity for himself and three companions to enable him to visit Kuwait, Iraq and Syria. The reason he states for the journey is for a change of climate, but it is more probable that he has some idea of meeting certain persons for the discussion of an oil concession. - aMAYtaja INDIA OFFICE ’ .

(ii) Local gossip has it that at a party given for the pilgrims at Al Mizdalifah in the Hijaz one of the Arab pilgrims, an inhabitant of Abyssinia, delivered a speech praising the rule of Italy in Abyssinia. Some of the Arabs present protested saying that it was not a place in which propaganda should be carried on. BAHRA IN; (i) The Muharram Processions passed off quietly. The Police arrangements were excellent. (ii) A rumour spread a few days back that after a wedding which was celebrated in Hidd, the bridegroom had turned into an ass and the bride into a bitch.

The •Rashgu* was wearing the Iranian flag and it was once stated that the Bahrain Government had had news of her coming and so had mounted the cannons to ward off attack and that the •Rashgu® was only the precursor of an Iranian invasion. (iv) Doctor Blegvad said that several countries had offered to take up his fish enquiring work, but that the Iranian Minister concerned had decided on Denmark, because years ago he had seen the milk collecting system and had been deeply impressed by the honesty of a people who could leave cans of milk standing unguarded by the roadside.(v) Doctor Blegvad said that His Majesty the Shah had asked him whether it was possible Jo establish commercial fisheries in the Persian Gulf and that he had replied that it could be done if money was put into it. The Shah informed him that money would be forthcoming. 49. OIL .

Her husband is said to be in Russia and her coming to Biy&amp;dh to be due to the recommendation of the wife of the Soviet Consul at Jedda, who is herself a doctor. Though believed to be well qualified, she aoes not do operative surgery, so that it is thought to be unlikely that her activities .j will stop the summoning of the Arabian Mission Doctors in operation cases, except that it is possible that she ffiay aevise the susmioniAg of doctors from Egypt instead.

On the night of the 18th/!9th April, this culminated in a real 'rough house', in the course of which.the Resident Manager, who had attempted to quiet the disturbance, was asssuited (though fortunately without serious injuries) and several persons more or less badly hurt. The Political/4 Political Agent*s help was invoked by the Company. Special Constables were appointed and on one night when serious trouble ap eared possible, a strong armed party of the Bahrain Police, under the Commandant of Police (Mr. C.B. Belgrave), was stationed on the out skirts of the Camp till early the next morning. On the 23rd and 24th April the Political Agent held a judicial enquiry and, under Section 21(l) of the Bahrain Order-in-Council, prohibited the four ringleaders from being within the limits of the Bahrain Order-in-Council and ordered them to leave by the mail steamer due the next day. This action ap .ears to have had the desired effect. It seems well to emphasise that there was no sign of any foeling between the British and American elements of the Company 1 s personnel* indeed the Political Agent received representations from a large body of the British emoj-oyees expressing deep | disgust at the misconduct of tne few men concerned and requesting him to take action in the matter in order to safeguard the good name of the British labour on the island. 58. bA»UDI ARABIA.

As regards the Muscat News, I think you are right as to this being of little interest to us. But, just in order to satisfy myself on the point, would you be so good as to lend me the file to look at. 3. There was one other Intelligence Report which I had intended to have included in the list although it is not an Iranian one, and that is the Bahrein Intelligence Report. The last one we received from the India Office was in June 1934 (P.Z.3593/34). Now that the Bahrein Petrols uni Company has become active we should like to have the report regularly.

Dear Colonel Toovey, Would you kindly refer to the War Office letter of 14th January, 1936, No.26/Pubns./3492 (M.1.2) about the renewal of the supply of certain Iranian diaries from this Office. 2. We have made arrangements for the supply of copies of the Kerman consular Diaires, and also of the Bushire Residency Diaries. We have also arranged to furnish you with copies of the Khorassan Political Diaries, which are the only diaries that are received from Meshed. (I think you will find that (a), (b) and (d) of your official letter are the same Diary.) 3. So far as I can make out, the cessation of the distribution to the War Office was largely due to the fact that the Government of India ceased to print the diaries for r easons of economy, and that it became difficult thereafter to find enough typed copies for all purposes. 4. As regards the request for copies of the Muscat News, we have no spare copies of this diary (which Lieutenant-Colonel C.W. Toovey, War Office, S. W. 1. • P.Z. 368 j 36.since April 1934 has been known as the Muscat Intelligence Summary), and we venture to doubt whether it is likely to be of very much practical value to you. I could lend you the file to look at if you like, and if after that you felt that the War Office have a real interest in this diary, we could arrange for a copy to be made available.

He informed the Political Agent that he was proceeding to Baghdad for medical treatment. The Shaikh’s journey from Abu Dhabi to Bahrain occupied eight days. The fact that his usue.l source of funds (Ahmad bin Khalaf, to whom he owes much money) appears to have dried up, was accompanied by unverified complaints of exactions from Hindu merchants (the geese who lay the golden eggs for him) lends some doubt as to whether the Shaikh’s visit to Baghdad was for purely medical reasons. The Shaikh is, however, a very sick man and suffering from chronic anaemia and the question of his successor is a topic of local conversation. His failure, however, to mention his prospective journey when H.M.S Shoreham visited him a few' days before his departure or to ask for the usual letter of good offices gives reason for the above suspicion.^ 129.

The Shaikh came on board and the usual calls were exchanged. He was very friendly. His courteous bearing, good manners, and the control he exercised over his relations and followers are equalled only by the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Qatar, and are in marked contrast to the other Shaikhs who appear to regard a visit of H.M f s Ships as a Godsent opportunity of obtaining something for nothing. A particular example of this was Shaikh Juma ! of Dibai who having relieved Commander Harvey of his best cigarettes, which he held in one hand, placed his other hand to his mouth to lend added strength to his demand is for his customary one gun salute. 4. On the 25th hme the Political Agent handed to the Shaikh of Dibai a letter informing him that if immediate payment of compensation was not ma.de for the lighters looted in May 1934 travel facilities for him and his subjedts w r ould be withheld.

On the 24th March he received a demand from Ha.hli * Abdul Nabi al Bushiri, a Persian subject residing in Bahrain, for the repayment of an old debt of Rs.900/-. Hamad Sulaiman replied that all his old debts had been paid up by the Qusaibis. Uaj.ii ! Abdul Nabi said he had received nothing. Later /’Abdullahml 1 Abdullv.h al Qusaibi took Ha j ji T Abdul Ni.bx to t-sr for r it lag to Hamad Sulaiman bin Hamdan and said Tt you cannot get the money and no one v ill recover it for you because Hamad, oulaiman is a delegate of His Ha.jesty King Bin S&amp;'ud'.

Reference paragraph N 0 s58(iii) of Intelligence h eport Ho:5 of 1935* In the course of their conversations the Sa f udi Representatives asked:- (1) . That special treatment should be given to King Bin Sa’ud in regard to the payment of transit duty, (ii). That transit dues on overside delivery should be abolished, (iii), That transit dues on goods landed and re-shipped should be reduced, and (iv). That the 'Ahmedi' incident should not be repeated. (2) . After several discussions the Bahrain Representatives, on the grounds of ancient friendship, agreed:- (a) that goods up to the value of two lakhs of rupees annually for King Bin Sa f ud f s personal use would be passed through free, provided the Bahrain Government received a communication from the Sa’ud.i Government informing them that the goods were for the King, (b) that the concession of overside delivery from steamers which had hitherto been limited to consignments of 1,000 bags or over would be reduced to IOC bags, and (c) that the 'Ahmedi' incident would not recur. /(s).4. ( 3 ). The £a f udi Representatives also asked that manifests should be issued to all dhows going to Sa^uoi ports from Eahraii and that the duty on Hasa dates should be revised. The Bahrain Representatives agreed that manifests would be issued on a basis of reciprocity, and that the duty on Hasa dates would be levied at 5% ad valorem on dates entering Bahrain and 2? ad valorem on dates shipped through Bahrain. This latter repre sents a big concession since the existing duties were fixed some ten years ago. The tentative settlement arrived at appears to have satisfied the Ga’udi Representatives. (4) . Hamad Sulaiman bin Hamdan vras summoned urgently to the mainland and left for Jubail on the 30th March. He returned to Bahrain on the 22nd. It is understood that the reason for his going to the mainland was an apprehension that the delegation’s telegraphic communications were being tampered with in Bahrain. (5) . After Hamad Sulaiman bin Hamdan’s return and after the tentative settlement mentioned in paragraphs (l) to (?) above had been referred to King bin Sa’ud, the Sa’udi delegation again met the Bahrain Representatives and qualified paragraph 2(a) as follows King Bin Sa’ud did not v;ish any personal concession from the Bahrain Government but instead preferred a proportional reduction in the transit dues at present levied. It is understood that this has been agreed to by the Bahrain Representatives and a one-eighth reduction granted without any stipulations as to fluctuations. At present the proportional reduction of one-eighth represents two lakhs oi rupees. 49.TRUCIAL COAST. 1. SHARJAH . (a). Reference paragraph H 0 :21/3 of Intelligence Report No:? of 1935.

The occupants of the launch informed Mr. Barnett, the representative of the Golden Valley Ochre and Oxide Company limited, who was working on the Island, that they were merchants and were on their way to Dibai from Longah, and asked him if they could be of any assists nee. Mr. Barnett entrusted them with a letter for despatch by air mail to his firm through Mhan Sahib Husain bin Hasan of Sharjah. The letter is said to have contained information concerning the working of the Company under the Concession agreement and was never received by Khan Sahib Husain. On the 14th *ferch the Captain of a local dhow, which had been hired by Mr. Barnett, proceeded to Bandar Abbas and there recognised the director c ustoms and another Inspector as being the occupants of the launch that visited Abu Musa Island on the 7th March.

ABU DHABI . Mr. P.T.Cox, a geologist of the Anglo-Persian On Company BiTnited, visited Abu Dhabi from the 6th to 16th March to examine the possibility of finding artesian water for the Shaikh. Mr. Cox found the Shaikh very apathetic. His attitude was that there had been plenty of rain this year and there was no shortage of water and in consequence did not require anyone to search for water for him. The Shaikh, however, arranged for Mr. C 0 x to visit one or two places in the interior of the Principality. The result of his examin ation confirms Mr. Cox T previous opinion that there is little chance of finding water at shallow depths. 50. METIPROLOGICAL .

The French Sloop 'Bougainville', flying the Flag of Contre Amiral Rivet, Officer Commanding, Levant Station, arrived on a visit to Bahrain on the 14th February. In the evening the Admiral and several Officers came to tea at the Agency and were taken for a drive and shown round the bazaar by the Assistant Political Agent in the absence of the Political Agent on tour. They all appeared to be voracious readers of Arabian travel books and nearly all talked English. (ii). On the 15th February the Assistant Political Agent called upon the Admiral on board the 'Bougainville', which w r as gaily decorated with washing of an intimate nature. On landing the Admiral inspected a Guard of Honour at the Customs Pier and a salute of thirteen guns was fired. He then called on His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin T Isa A1 Khalifah at the Palace. His Excellency returned the Admiral’s call, in accordance with custom, at the Agency. (iii). The Assistant Political Agent entertained the Admiral and four Officers of the Ship at luncheon at the Agency and afterwards took them to the Oil Field where they were shown drilling operations in which they were very interested as this was their first visit to an Oil Field. On their return they met the Political Agent who had come back from tour that after noon. (iv). To anticipate the next report, the Admiral held a luncheon party on board the 'Bougainville' on the 16th and sailed for Bushire on the same afternoon. At the entrance to the Admiral’s dining room was a framed copy of the Carte Gastronomique of the Ecu de France! (v). H.M.S Fowey saluted the Admiral’s Flag when passing the 'Bougainville' and the latter replied. The usual calls were exchanged. /(vi).3. (vi)• It is understood that the French sailors requested an old man, who goes out to ships to sell things, to find women for them at which he was deeply affronted. On their arrival on shore they aired their knowledge of the English language by demands for n Drrrink? Women?'! They were told that the former was prohibited: but it is understood that their other require ments were supplied. The populace seemed to be much diverted. 21. TRU CIAL COAS T. (l)• Has al Khaimah . (a) • The 'Bougainville' visited Has al Khaimah on her way to Bahrain. The Shaikh of Has al Khaimah did not come on board, but met the Admiral on the beach with some five hundred follow ers. The following conversation, as recounted by the Admiral is not without humour and is also possibly an useful indication of the Shaikh f s state of mind:- Shaikh: Are you British or French? Admiral: &gt;- I am French? Shaikh (hopefully): Are you at war with the British? Admiral: Shaikh: Admiral: Shaikh: The Admiral led the Political Agent to infer that he had not sold his arms to the Shaikh. (b) . An individual who was sent to Ras al Khaimah for that purpose reports that eight Officers and a Somali Interpreter landed at Ras al Khaimah. He confirms that the Shaikh met the party on the beach with horses and took them to his Fort. They were there for about one and an half hours and tea and coffee No, we are friends. Have you any arms: will you give me some? I have arms for my Ship, but none to give away. Well - will you sell me some? /was4. 3 fO was served. The Shaikh then told two of his nephews to take the party round the bazaar. They returned to the Fort to say good bye to the Shaikh, who is rumoured to have given them a letter in which (so it is presumed locally) he asked them to arrange for a geologist to see if fresh water can be had at Has al Khaimah. This fits in with a wish expressed by the Shaikh in November 1934 for an examination of the hills behind Has al Khairaah for water and oil. (c). H.M.S Bideford called at Tunb Island in response to a signal from the lighthouse keeper and reported that on the 29th December 1934, the Shaikh of Has al &amp;haimah had sent to Tunb Island a man, Nasir, who removed his flag and flagstaff. The Residency Agent, Sharjah, was ordered by the Honourable the Political Resident In the Persian Gulf to enquire from the Shaikh the reason for his extraordinary action. The enquiries are proceeding and the matter is under the consider ation of His Majesty*s Government. (2) . Abu Dhabi . On the 8th February the Political Agent arrived at Abu Dhabi in H.M.S Fowey. After the usual calls negotiations were opened with Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan, the Ruler of Abu Dhabi, for a settlement of the vexed question of the petrol tank on Sir Bani Yas Island and for the grant of further air facil ities on Sir Bani Yas Island and at Abu Dhabi. After long drawn out discussions the Shaikh sealed an agreement on the 13th February providing for:- (i) the continuance of the petrol tank on Sir Bani Yas Island, and (ii) the establishment of a landing ground on Sir Bani Yas Island and near Abu Dhabi.

On the 14th February the Political Agent visited Abu Musa Island in H.M.S Fowey to see the Company’s Mining Engineer, who had just arrived in order to start mining operations. 22. BAHRAIN . (a) . The old standing ill-feeling between the Sunnis and Shi’ahs (Baharinah) of Bahrain has again become acute and the latter put forward a number of political demands, some reason able and others of an extravagant nature and started open agitation in support of them. His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin ’Isa A1 Khalifah had already had under consideration certain measures designed to improve the position of his Baharinah subjects and this policy will be pursued, though the leaders have been warned, both by His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad and by the Political Agent, that they will be held personally responsible for any breach of the peace and the agitation has subsided. (b) . Elections to the Manamah Municipal Council were held on the 12 th, 13th and 14th February.

Early in the month the body of a young woman was washed ashore at Muharraq. Police enquiries were instituted and it was found that the woman was a Bahrain subject named, Ayesha, and that she was a well known prostitute. Further enquiries failed to produce definite evidence, but five notorious characters of Miharraq are suspected. The difficulty of getting evidence in such cases precludes their being charged with the mrder, but in view of the present case and their past records, the Bahrain Government have asked permission to repatriate them to Sa’udi Arabia. (ii) . During 1934 the Bahrain firm of Messrs A &amp; M Yatim put a small plot of land under tobacco. The experiment proved successful and, it is understood, that they have planted a large area with tobacco this year. The same firm also tried to start a poultry farm with birds imported from Persia, but the experiment was not a success as most of the fowls died from chicken cholera. The few that remained were sold hastily to The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. In this connection it is interesting to remark that most of the fowls recently imported from the United States of America by an employee of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, died of the same disease, while awaiting transhipment to the mainland. 13. OIL . (i). The Bahrai n Petroleum Company Limited . (l) T 0n the 23rd January, a n»tor mechanic, Hajji Ibrahim /bin/14. 4. bin ’Abdullah, employed by The Bahrain Petroleum Company limited, sustained severe injuries from burns which he received while working on one of the Company’s motor vehicles in the workshop. Apparently he was using petrol for cleaning purposes below the car and another employee ’’shorted” an electrical connection, which ignited the petrol vapour. Ha.iji Ibrahim died the same night. This is the first accident entailing loss of life that has occurred since the Company commenced operations in Banrain. In connection with this accident, it may be mentioned that the Con^any hold ’safety 1 meetings at intervals at which employees receive instruction in safety methods and it is under stood that at the last meeting held shortly before this accident * the danger of fire from petrol was emphasised.

It is hoped to begin extraction in the course of the winter. 144. BAHRAIN . The old bitter Sunni-Shi r ah feeling which has been dormant for a considerable time, has recently shown signs of reviving owing to two or three unfortunate incidents, giving rise to friction, having occurred one after the other. 145. DIBAI. Shaikh Sa ! id bin Miktum, Ruler of D ibai, has for some time had trouble with his cousins, the sons of the late Shaikhs Rashid and Buti (see the Genealogical Table in Pocket 4 of Volume III of the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf by Lorimer. /Lately(^) 4. Lately they have become more arrogant in their behaviour towards him and have indulged in violence and looting in Dioai. On the 23rd September 1934 an attempt on his life was planned and it was proposed that on his return from a visit to T Ain Khamir a meeting should be held to depose him. As the matter was an internal affair, the Shaikh v/as informed that he as ^uler should deal with his cousins as he thought fit, but that (and this was given out in the town) any persons who caused loss of life or damage to the property of British subjects would be held to account. Certain steps were taken to encourage Shaikh Sa^d, while not deviating from the policy of His Majesty*s Government of non-interference in the internal affairs of the Sheikhdoms on the Crucial Coast. H.M.S Lupin proceeded to Dibai, aircraft of the Royal Air Force flew low over ^ibai, the Shaikh was openly promised a present of arms and ammunition and later the Political Agent proceeded to Ribai. The Shaikh demanded that his cousins should, come to his house and swear an oath that they would obey his rule and cease from troubing the people. A critical period was the night of the 31st October/lst November, when the Shaikh gave an ultimatum to his cousins to come to his house or to quit the town by midday on the 1st November, and brought in bedouin (Manasir) to help him. The members of the A1 bu Falasah (the Shaikh*s sub-tribe) with the help of a local ■ho table, Hihemmad bin Ahmad, mediated between the Shaikh and his cousins and after prolonged negotiations (from which the Political Agent held carefully aloof) were successful in arranging for a representative of each of the branches of the cousins to take the required oath. The Shaikh expressed himself fully satisfied with the settlement and appeared most grateful for the measure of support which had been accorded to him. It is too early to form a definite opinion, but it seems probable /that4. that our position on the Trucial Coast has been considerably strengthened by this incident. 146. CA'Tjpi ARABI A. (i). Local opinion is’ interested in news (November 12th) of trouble between King B in Sa f ud and B in Rumman of Taimah. Bin Rumman is said to have built a wall round Taimah and to have filled in all wells near Taimah in order to make it difficult to beseige him. f Abdul 'kzlz bin Musa T ad, Amir of Hail, is said to have gone to Riyadh to discuss steps to be taken against Bin Rumman. An earlier rumour (November 7th) said that Bin Rumman had gone to the Palestine border. 147. GENERAL .

The Political Agent accompanied by the Honourable the Political Resident to Qhtar, where they remained from the 2nd to the 4th April in connection T with the Oil Concession. (ii). It will be recalled that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have permission to explore for oil throughout ^atar up to August 1^34. They have, however, experienced much -- difficulty m negotiating tor a concession, because of the offers made by the Standard Oil Company of California. It was discovered, on a previous visit, that Shaikh ^Abdullah bin ^asirri al Thani proposed to give to the Standard Oil Company of California the same exploration facilities which the Anglo-persian Oil Company Limited now enjoy, and then (b)&lt;tOl 5. to play tlie Companies oil against eacii otlier. To grant sucii facilities was clearly, however, contrary to the terms of his Treaty with His Llajesty T s Government (which precludes him from granting concessions without their permission), for exploration facilities form part and parcel ol a concession. It will, however, be appreciated that once exploration facilities had been given, it would have been impossible, in practice, for the Shaiich to refuse (or for His Majesty T s Government to prevent; a full concession being granted, if favourable terms were offered. It is clear that 3hai£h r Abdullah had been advised to adopt this clever method of getting the American Company into Qatar by the Standard Oil Company of California and King Bin Sa T ud. It was subsequently discovered that Shaimh T Abdullah had had an interview with an American during his visit to Riyadh and that the Standard Oil Company had offered Ityo above any terms which the Anglo- Persian Oil Company Limited might offer. (iii). t.ith the authority of His Hajesty T s Government, Shaikh T Abdullah, who was manifestly afraid of King Bin 3 a ? ud was warned that he must adhere strictly to his Treaty oblig ations and that he must, therefore, cease to have any relations, the existence of which he admitted, save those of courtesy (for example, T Id greetings), with King Bin Sa'ud. He was informed that the British Government regarded explor ation facilities as being part and parcel of a concession and that he could not, therefore, under the terms of his Treaty, grant such facilities, and would not be permitted to do so. Shaikh T Abdullah threatened to leave s^atar (a dire threat in Arab eyes) and also said that he would give a concession to no one. He was reminded that if he were to refuse the good money which was offered, his relations and people would probably give him great trouble. ( 6 )6 . Shaikh ’Abdullah was further informed that in return for their insistence on their Treaty rights, His Majesty’s G-overnment were prepared to give him protection by land against the attack of a great enemy or against big raids, in addition to the protection by sea which he already enjoyed. Shaikh ’Abdullah asked that these matters should be put down in writing and an exchange of letters ensued. This assured him that His Majesty’s Government were in earnest, and his attitude changed for the better. (iv). The position at present is that Shaikh ’Abdullah has been warned clearly of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government, and is apparently prepared to endeavour to come to terms with the Anglo-Persian Gil Company, but the gulf between his demands and their offer is still wide. The Standard Gil Company of California are, however, apparently making every effort to secure a concession in Qatar and the struggle is by no means over. (v). It has been discovered that a doctor of the Arabian Mission on a recent visit to ^atar tried to have indirect influence brought upon Shaikh ’Abdullah in the interests of the American Company. He also apparently took every opportuni ty to spread the idea that the Americans are the wealthy people of the world and the British only ’’politicians”. 3.

KUMAID bin ABDUL RAHMAN bin SAIF, Chief of HAMRIYAH, recently sent his fidawia to mui'der his mgrig* uncle,RAHMAII bin SAIF. The fidawis are reported to have told RAHMAH that they had risen against HUMAID and that they wanted him to be their chief. They invited him to accompany them to(6) 5. HAL3HIYAH. Believing tlieir story BAIIMAH did so,accompanied by 25 men from the AWAMIK tribe. On reaching HAMRIYAH he was asked to enter the fort but feeling suspicious he would not do so. HUMAID*S fidawis and retainers in the fort thereupon opened fire on RAKMAH and his party as they tried to escape and in the firing one of BAHMAH’S beduins was wounded in the hand. (c).

It appears that the wages of the three fidawis were five months in arrears and as they found they could get nothing but promises from the SHAIKH they decamped with the rifles and ammunition. 348. H3ARLIHG . (a) . In Para 268 of Diary No:ll of 1933 it was rumoured that Mr.GAHDMAL GASHIHAL,a Bombay Pearl Merchant,had gone bankrupt.

(b) . Prices in BAHRAIN are said to be better but it is said that the catch and quality of the pearls are very poor. The deficiency in the catch may be due to the high winds which blew all through the summer and which effectively hindered diving. (c) . The quality of the pearls found off DIBAI are said to be very good,but ibices have not been as good as those prevailing in BAHRAIN.-6- 349. IlSTEORQLOGICAL . (a).
