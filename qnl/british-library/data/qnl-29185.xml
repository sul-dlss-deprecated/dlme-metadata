Will you please inform Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd. accordingly. for Chief Telegraph Censor. WMFH/DiBMiss Odgers The last paragraph of the letter from the P. and T. Censorship below says that telegrams about the Nearchus are being sent to the Censorship Authorities in Bagdad and Tehran. Apparently the Censorship Department here did not realise that the difficulty has arisen nearer home viz. with regard to the acceptance at Electra House of our telegrams addressed to the Political Resident. It therefore seerns that the first necessity is for the Censorship people at Electra House to be instructed to accept telegrams addressed to the Nearchus. I have discussed the matter on these lines v/ith Commander Phipps-Homby at the Censorship Department; and he has been trying to find out from Electra House what actually happened. For some reason he wants to be sure of the history of the question before the necessary instructions are given. Apparently it is also necessary to consult the Admiralty once more. He will be on leave next week but Lieutenant Commander Wood (Ext.206) will be dealing with his work. Commander Phipps-Homby will ask Lieutenant Commander Wood to get in touch with you about this, but if you hear nothing in a few days' time would you please ring him up. w€ %^IAaA 4 Xtyy\ ( ($ .

'NEARCHTIS' were not allowed to be transmitted to him by radio; it is a fact that there are Censorship prohibitions on the wireless transmission of telegrams to ships at sea, whether British, Allied or Neutral, although it is not necessary to go into them here• I have, however, consulted the Admiralty on the subject, and they see no objection to these messages being sent within the limits of the Persian Gulf, though it might be advisable to stipulate that they should not be sent if the vessel is outside Persian Gulf waters. Accordingly, a telegram to that effect is being sent to our Censorship Representatives in Baghdad and Teheran, to say that there is no objection to telegrams for the Political Resident, while afxoat in the L*T.
