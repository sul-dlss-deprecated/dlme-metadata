V 11, Birchin Lane, London, E.0.3. 12th August, 1935. Lear Mr. Clauson, Refining . The Company is considering the erection of a Refinery to deal with the Bahrein crude oil. There are several locations open for selection but before a conclusion is reached the Company desire to know whether, in the event of the Bahrein Islands being selected, the Sheikh of Bahrein would assent, upon the advice of His Majesty’s Government, to such a modification of the Lease as would, in effect, extend the relief contemplated by Article III of the Lease from ten charged in any way. I would hasten to say the Company are under no apprehension that such a charge is ever likely to be contemplated but express provision eliminating tax on profits appears to be made in other Concessions of the kind held oy the Coup any and the Company take this opportunity to ask that some such express provision should appear in tneir lease. Such a provision with the relief asked for above would assure the Company freedom at all times hereafter from all forms of imposition relative to their operations in Bahrein except the agreed upon royalties. An assurance of this kind would, I feel certain, have an undoubted influence in inclining this Co lip any to select Bahrein for their Refinery in preference to other locations having equal or greater advantages. In other words, it could not fail materially to assist the In addition, the Company would ask for the same assurances that there is no likelihood of their profits being Company/© ■&gt; 2. Company in their known desire to give effect to the wishes of the Sheikh for a Refinery within his territories. The Company would erect and operate such a Refinery as a commercial venture in the hope that it would at all times hereafter provide an outlet for Bahrein crude oil. It is not, at this juncture, possible to specify the products likely to result from the refining processes employed from time to time 'by the Company. Undoubtedly a market exists for refined products, such, for example, as fuel oil, where a market does not exist for the crude product. The result of refining would, it is believed, be reflected in an increased production of Bahrein crude oil and a corresponding increase in royalty for the Sheikh. I even venture to visualise that a logical result of the erection of a Refinery in Bahrein would be an arrangement made without prejudice to the interests of the Sheikh to supply f uel oil ' to j His Majesty’s Government’s ships at Bahrein. It may he ashed why, with the wide exemption irom taxation which the Company already enjoy under tne^r Lease, they should ash for more? The answer is that the operation of a Refinery requires a continuous supply of material for extending, improving and repairing the plant itself as vvel^ as acids and other chemicals and materials used in ohe refining processes, which is not true to the same extent the actual production of crude oil after drilling and development have heen largely completed. You can appreciate, therefore, that in legislating for a long period such as is provided by the Lease, every care must he tahen hy the Company to see there is a minimum of extraneous expenses. The/© 3. The erection of a Refinery in Bahrein may entail some provision being made to ensure that the Sheikh should not lose royalty on oil used as fuel in the refining of imported oils. It may be that the sheikh will be satisfied wioh an informal assurance of the Company that this point will be taken care of if and when the time comes to treat imported oils in Bahrein. Yours sincerely, (Sgd. ) H. R. BALLA1TTYUE M. J. Clauson, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W«1*- Deliver y. »COKFIDEHTIixL. IIn^DIA OFFICE . F.Z. 5565/35. NOTE OF DISCUSSION Y'/ITH IvIE. BALLaIITYNE ON 9T'H AUGUST. % Mr. Ballsntyne called by appointment on August 9th to discuss certain matters in connection with the possible establishment of a refinery by the Bahrein Petroleum Company in the Persian Gulf area. Mr.Laithwaite was present at the discussion. 2. Mr. Ballantyne explained in the first place that the Company had not yet reached a conclusion on this subject, but that they were very seriously considering the establishment of a refinery in the Persialj Gulf area: he would not in so many words say necessarily in Bahrein. They were anxious, to assist them in reaching a conclusion on this matter, to ascertain the general attitude of H.M.G., both on the question generally and as regards certain modifications which the Company might wish to secure in the terms of the Bahrein mining lease in the event of their deciding to establish a refinery in Bahrein. The type of refinery which the Company had in mind was one which would be capable of dealing 'with 10,000 barrels a day. He wished, however, to melee it clear that, even if they established a refinery they could not commit themselves to maintain it permanently. Here, as elsewhere in their work, the deciding factor must be world economic and marketing conditions and it would be unreasonable to ^expect the Company to keep a refinery/r o^ m A/ ^ I f .V' t 0 E. refinery ^oins if they ceased to have any market for refined products or if the market for such products was such as to offer no commercial inducement to then to operate it. The points which he wished to raise in connection with the terms of the mining lease were the following: (a] An extension of the benefits conferred by the second sub-paragraph of article 3 over the whole period of the lease, irrespective of 'whether any refinery which may now be established by the Company in Bahrein might or might not continue in operation for the whole of such period. (b) A rewording of the sub-paragraph, largely of a drafting character, with a view to making ios precise content clearer. The clause as it stood had been taken over from the original lease, and he had never really been satisfied with it, although he had not raised the point when the lease was being redrafted. (c) an extension to subsidiary companies of the rights given by article 1. ( d) A confirmation of the Company’s understanding, about which they did not in fact think there could be any reasonable doubt, having regard to the terms of the first sub-paragraph of article 1 of the lease, that the word 'pipeline” in sub-paragraph 3 of article 1 applied not merely to a crude oil pipeline but to any other pipelines in connection with a refinery in Bahrein which the Company might establish under the terms of sub-paragraph 1 of article 1. 4. Mr. Ballantyne having remarked in this connection rthat if oil was found in Hnsa there might be advantage in avoiding having more refineries than one in a very small area, he was invited, with a view to getting the position clear to indicate what the attitude of the Company would be as j1 3. as regards crude oil imported from Hasa into a refinery in Bahrein for the purpose of being refined there. Did they contemplate that it would enter duty free? He would .ap'oreciate that it would 'be liable to customs duty in the absence of any specie! arrangements safeguarding the interests of the Sheikh in this matter. 5. As regards his other propositions, it was suggested to him that it would be better not to raise the question of subsidiary companies; which would raise difficult questions of nationality, safeguards, etc. He thereupon withdrew his suggestion. 6. ns regards the pipeline, Mr. Ballantyne was informed that nri in a facie there seemed much force in his contention. The matter was, of course, one of construction and could be further considered. 7. As regards the re7/ording of sub-paragraph 2 of article 3, it was suggested to him that he might put into draft form his viev; of the terms of a redraft. If the question was merely one of drafting no very serious difficulty would perhaps he likely to arise. 8. As regards his main proposition ,( a), Mr.Ballantyne was informed that, as had always been made clear to him in the past, the Sheikh attached the greatest importance to a local refinery in Bahrein. The Company had in the past indicated that they would be willing to agree to the establishment of such a refinery if commercial conditions permitted, but there had never been any question of a quid pro quo in the form of any modifications of/ i4. of the terms of the Bahrein mining lease. We might not wish to press this aspect of the question at the rresent time, since it was probably to the interest of both parties that a refinery should be established on reasonable terms. But in the first place we did not understand why an extension of the Company's rights under sub-paragraph 2 of article 3 should now be required as a condition of their establishing a refinery: they already had refining rights under sub-paragraph 1 of article 1 and they had in the past apparently been quite satisfied that, despite that, the rights given them under sub-paragraph 2 of article 3 as at present drafted were adequate. Secondly, it seemed unreasonable that the Sheikh should be invited to give a concession under this head to cover the whole period of the lease when the Company’s undertaking in regard to the operation of a refinery was so indefinite and the refinery might Vvell be in operation for a short time only. Would it not be better, if any concession should prove possible on this question, that the period of this concession under sub-paragraph 2 of article 3 should be strictly limited to that of the operation of the refinery? Thirdly, in dealing with the Sheikh the Company must not overlook that, as t had been pointed out to them in the past, they had acquired a very valuable concession on very favourable .terms; and that the Sheikh was now inclined to contrast the sums he had received with those v/hich had been granted in Qatar and Koweit. Any further concession must clearly in these circumstances be a matter of give and take. Finally/Finally, it would, of course, be necessary that there should be a clear understanding on the question already referred to as regards the position of crude oil which might be imported from Hasa for the purposes of being refined or otherwise used for the Company's purposes in Bahrein. 9. Mr. Ballantyne said that he thought the Sheikh now appreciated that he had scored heavily at the expense of other persons in the Gulf owing to the fact that the terms on which his concession had been granted had not been very onerous. As regards the other point raised, he said that he agreed that so far as the first ten years of the lease were concerned the Company were amply protected as regards customs duties, etc. by the terms of sub-paragraph ^ of article 3 of the lease. But in the previous negotiations the sub-paragraph had been considered by the company primarily on the basis of crude oil production and not on the basis of refining. If they were now to establish a refinery and it were to be on any scale it would be important to them to secure an extension such as they had now suggested. The item of most importance 'would probably be sulphuric acid, the du-ty on which might run to large sums. The Company felt bhat as any refinery established would be in the interests of the Sheikh and ; r the Company had entire liberty of action under their lease as to whether to erect one or not, they might reasonably, if they decided to erect or&gt;e, ask for a concession of this nature from the Sheikh in return. As : \ i regards/6. regards the suggestion that the Sheikh would be giving a disproportionately valuable consideration by granting customs concessions in respect of the whole period of the lease in return for an undertaking to establish a refinery which might be operated on a small scale or for a short period, he thought the answer was that it would cost the Company from £400,000 to £500,000 to set up a refinery of the type now contemplated and that, unable as they were to oommit themselves to its being operated through the whole period of the lease, it was common sense to suppose that they would not embark on large capital expenditure of this nature unless they intended to make reasonable use of a refinery when set up. From the Sheikh's point of view, if the refinery were to operate even for only 10 or 20 years H. B. would still, they thought, derive sufficient benefit from its establishment to repay amply any customs concession which he might nov/ make on the basis which had been proposed. 10. As regards the possible importation of crude oil from Hasa or elsewhere for the purpose of being refined etc., Mr. Ballantyne said he appreciated the difficulties involved. After further discussion the suggestion was non-committally put to him that a solution which might be fair both to the Company and to the ( Sheikh would be that in the &lt; event of the Sheikh agreeing to crude oil tor the purpose of refining being introduced free of duty, a special royalty should be payable in respect of the refined juroduct derived from such crude oil which was subsequently/7 . subsequently exported (as distinct from crude oil imported for the ordinary purposes of the Company in connection with the exploitation of the Bahrein oil deposits). Mr. Ballantyne, without committing himself, said that he thought an arrangement on this basis might be worth investigation. The Company however on further consideration might prefer not to deal with this question at the present juncture in view of the complicated political issues -which might be involved on the Company’s side. 11. Mr. Ballantyne said in conclusion that the Company had no desire to haggle over this question. They were anxious to take an immediate decision one way or the other and his instructions were to dispose ox the matter as rapidly as possible. In the light of the conversation he would put propositions of the nature which had oeen discussed to us in writing and he v/ould be grateful for the earliest possible disposal of them. If no difficulty arose and if the Company decided to set up a refinery, their intention was to set one up at once. In the course of the discussion on this point, he made the suggestion, that if it v/ould be of any interest to H.M.G. the Company v/ould be very glad to consider in their marketing the special requirements / of H.M.Ships in the Persian GulJ etc. It was understood that the reference was to some,concession us regards price. It v/as pointed out to him that much as H.M. G. would appreciate any s pe c i al/8 . special arrangements which the Company might come to in this connection, there could he no question of any arrangement »vhich in any way prejudiced the rights of the Sheikh of Bahrein or v/hich could in any way he regarded as a price for the goodwill of II.M.G. i^ this matter. H.k.G. must in all questions affecting this concession and similar concessions consider solely the rights and interests of the ruler concerned. IVIr. Ballantyne said that he entirely appreciated this and that the Company had no intention of making any offer which would he in any w r ay detrimental to the interests of the Sheikh, hut that he saw no reason, as the Sheikh would get his royalties on oil produced in any event, why there should he any conflict in this case. It was agreed that on this assumption he might mention the point in his communication to H.M.G., subject to a specific rider, however, that any suggestion made by the Company in this connection would he on the understanding that it saved the rights of the Sheikh in the fullest sense and was entirely without prejudice to them in any way.

We propose therefore before communicating with the Gulf to suggest to Ballantyne that the redraft had better be confined to specific rather than general exemptions and that it should be made clear to the Sheikh that what the Company are asking for is exemption from taxation on their profits in addition to the exemption from customs duties which they at present enjoy# As regards Ballantyne’s point about Bahrein oil used as fuel oil in refining imported oil, it seems clearly sufficient to have an informal undertaking on the point at this stage. In any case, in the event of the Company wishing to import oil from elsewhere to be refined at Bahrein, the Sheikh and the Company will no doubt have to come to some general agreement as to the whole basis on which such importation should be permitted.

I refer to the talk I had with you and Mr.Laithwaite on Friday last when v/e discussed the possibility of the Company refining oil in Bahrein. I am sending to you at the same time as this letter, a letter requesting that the Company be given assurances that if they erect a Refinery in Bahrein they will start off with the encouragement that they are not likely to be hampered with their future operations in Bahrein by impositions other than the royalties provided for by the always the possibility of imported oil being treated at such a Refinery, the Bahrein oil being used as fuel for the understanding that if imported oil were so treated, then the Bahrein oil used as fuel for the purpose would bear the royalty of Rs.3.8.0. per ton. The question is whether we should endeavour to give effect to such an understanding now or should allow it to wait over until such time as imported oil is treated. 7/e could alter Article VII of the Lease by adding after the word ''territories'*, sub—article Lease As was pointed out to me at our interview, there is purpose. Such a contingency undoubtedly calls lor an . Clauson Esq., India Office, (a)/ Whitehall, S.W.l.2 . I9B. n (a), the following words - ’’other than the oil used in connection with the refining of imported oils”. I can, however, visualise the measurement of oil used as fuel for the treatment of imported oils being difficult in practice but given the principle that the Bahrein oil used in the treatment of imported oils shall bear the royalty provided for by the Lease, it should be quite a simple matter for the Sheikh and the Company to come to an understanding which would provide a satisfactory equivalent. I have drafted a formal modification to the Lease to give effect to the alterations proposed and in order that you may have the earliest possible opportunity of considering them I enclose a draft in triplicate. I tnink that once a decision is taken by the Company, there may not be sufficient time for formal documents to be put through before the Company start work on the erection of a Refinery so I suggest that we agree the proposed draft alterations ana that you let the Company have the assurance of His Majesty’s Government that the Sheikh will be aavised to agree to them. We can then go ahead as quickly as possible to obtain the signature of the Sheikh to the formal document. I think the formal document will be a Deed modifying the Lease. Yours, &amp;c., (Sgd.) H.R.

Dear Clauson, In/reply to your letter of 13th August, P.Z.559l/3o, regarding Ballantyne's proposals for the erection of a refinery in Bahrein, and for the amendment of the Company's lease, I agree that it is desirable that a refinery should he established in Bahrein, but I hardly think that Ballantyne's proposals need be accepted as they stand, in order to secure this object. Our information is that the Company are having considerable difficulty in disposing of their crude oil. If that is so they have probably already reached the conclusion that the only thing open to them is to put up a refinery, on the assumption that they would be in a much better position to market refined products than crude oil. It is true there is the question whether there is any better site in the Gulf than Bahrein. My impression is there is not when all things are taken into consideration. The Company knowing of the Cheikh’s desire to have a refinery apparently think he will be prepared to make some concessions to secure it end so they put forward their proposals for emending the lease. While pressing us for concessions the Company are careful not to com]%it themselves to maintaining a refinery. It is doubtful/ M-J.Clauson, Esq., India Office, Whitehall,doubtful whether the life of a refinery could.be put at more than 10 years, so that there is a good deal of special pleading in Bellantyne ! s point that once having spent their money on a refinery they would hardly be likely not to maintain it. With regard to his proposed alteration to Article I I suggest that we can accept it as it does no more I think than correct a clericaJi error. It was clearly intended from the wording ot the first part 01 Article I, that more than one pipeline could be laid and nes In regard to Article III I do not see any great objection, in spite of what I have said above, uo the removal of the n ten year limit” on exemption from customs etc., duties. The maintenance of this provision was one to which the Colonial Office used to attach great importance and the Anglo-Irani an Oil Company claims that it was one of the reasons for the breakdown of some of the early negotiations in the Gulf with that Company. It should not be overlooked, however, that in ooher cases with which we have had to deal recently in the Middle East and Gulf, the Companies concerned have been required to make some payment to the Government as an acknowledgment of the concession, besides paying a much more substantial minimum annual royalty than is provided for in the Bahrein Agreement. It may be admitted that the Sheikh of Bahrein has secured quite a good rate of royalty, i.e. Rs.o.o.O per ton there is ? limit on the purposes for v/hich the pipeli are to be used. miV 3 . of net crude oil, and so long as the concession is worked on a substantial scale, the revenues from oil should be satisfactory. But there is nothing which requires the Company to maintain a production at any particular level and if imported oil of better quod-ity could be secured for treatment in the refinery, and Bahrein oil were to be used mainly as fuel, the Sheikh 1 s position would be seriously prejudiced by the concession which is sought. The oil concession was originally obtained very cheaply, and the minimum annual royalty no./ payable is only Bs.75,000 per annum in Bahrein, as compared with Bs.95,000 to Bs.250,000 per annum in Koweit, and from Bs.150,000 to Bs.300,000 per annum in Q,atar. In both of the above Agreements, payments have been agreed to as a consideration for freedom from import duties and taxation. Iraq and Persia may also be referred to as examples in this connection. ft* I The revised Article III. suggested by Ballantyne is I suggest much too wide and it would oe better to follow the Koweit and Q,atar provisions. I think also that it would be preferable now to amend Article YII of the Lea.se, instead of allowing it to wait over, by adopting Ballantyne 1 s suggestion of adding after the word 11 territories 11 sub-article (a) the words 11 other than the oil used in connection with the refining of imported oils 11 . Oil used as fuel for this purpose should certainly bear a royalty payment. One leave the settlement of the formula to be used for ascertaining/ f- L I u Z&lt;y 4 ascertaining the quantity until the matter actually arises. I do not think that you will find the Company prepared to pay customs duty on oil imported for treatment at the refinery, or that they will he prepared to leave over till a later date the settlement of the conditions on which they will he allowed to import oil. If you want to put in a safeguard we might suggest some such phrase as 11 the Company undertake that the production of Bahrein oil shall not he allowed to suffer as a result of the importation of oil from other territory”.

Mr.Ballantyne called by appointme esterday and the proposals put forward in his two letters of August the Petroleum Department in Mr.Starling’s letter of It was put to Mr.Ballantyne that the position appears to be follows: (a) It would suit the Standard Company very well to set up a refinery in Bahrain; (b) It would also suit the Sheikh, though so far as we can see the only real tangible benefit which he is likely to gain from it is the probable increase in the production of Bahrain crude oil. The extra employment which a refinery would involve would be comparatively small* Mr.Ballantyne agreed. (c) The Company betbre taking actual steps to sink a lot of money in a refinery at Bahrain want to be sure that they will not in future be open to blackmailing impositions from the Sheikh or his successors, however unlikely these may be. (in this connection it was pointed out to Mr.Ballantyne that since in the ordinary course of obsolescence, depreciation, etc. the actual life of a refinery is presumably very much less than 55 years, indeed probably would not exceed a quarter of that period, it was difficult for him to press too far the argument in his letter that before setting up a refinery it was essential for the Company to have 12th were discussed in the light of advice given by complete exemption from duties and taxation for the whole/whole period of the lease. Mr.Ballantyne, however, pointed out that although a refinery on paper may only last 10 or 12 years, and, so far as 'book-keeping is concerned, is regarded as being written off at the end of this period, and although, if no renewals, improvements, etc. were done, it would probably not last longer than that, it would obviously be the Company’s intention if they set up a refinery to keep it working for an indefinite period by means of replacements, renewals, improvements, etc*); (d) The Sheikh would no doubt realise the Company’s desire to know exactly where they stood and so far as we were concerned here we should probably see no overwhelming objection to the exemptions desired being granted, especially as somewhat similar exemptions were granted in other cases. /The cases of course being e.g. Qatar and Koweit/. But the mere decision of the Company to put up a refinery in the Sheikh’s territory when in point of fact it suits them to do so in any case could hardly be regarded as an adequate quid pro quo for the very substantial concessions which the Company were seeking from the Sheikh, In other cases of the kind in which His Majesty’s Government were concerned, adequate consideration had been given by the companies to the Ruler specifically on account of the exemptions granted. As regards the question of imported oil,it was explained to Mr.Ballantyne that there were two points to be considered, (l) It seems unfair that Bahrain crude oil used for the process of refining crude oil imported from elsewhere/elsewhere should secure exemption from royalty under Article 7(a) on the ground that it is u oil required for the customary operations of the Company’s installations”. This was common ground between us and Mr.Ballantyne. (2) It seems unfair that the Sheikh should not make any money at all out of the retining in his territory of oil from outside his territory* and he ought to he able to do so* e.g. by taking a small royalty on oil so treated. Under Article 3 as it stands imported crude oil would at present be liable to pay import duty* (Mr.Ballantyne incidentally denies this)* Mr.Ballantyne said that he had not appreciated this second point at the previous interview, and thought that all we were aiming at was the first point. He promised to discover what was the general practice in matters of this kind. The points raised in Mr.Ballantyne’s actual letters of 12th August were then considered. As regards the proposed amendment to Article 1 in regard to the pipe line, it was agreed that this was little more than a correction of a misprint and that there should be no difficulty about it. Mr.Ballantyne was told that if a Refinery were established by the Company there might not be any very great difficulty about extending from 10 years to the end of the lease the exemptions actually granted at present by Article 3 of the lease, viz: freedom from import and export duties and freedom from taxation on land property, though it must be recognised that this involved a very considerable potential concession'by the Sheikh. Mr*Ballantyne’s second proposition, viz: that the Company should he assured freedom at all times hereafter from all forms of imposition relative to their operations in Bahrain except royalties agreed upon, was, however, a very much more difficult proposition. It seemed quite reasonable, as had been stated before, that the Company, if they were going substantially to increase their commitments in Bahrain, should know precisely where they stood in regard to their future financial commitments to the Sheikh. But it was equally reasonable that they should pay for a concession of this kind, as had been done in similar cases elsewhere, and there appeared to be two obvious ways in which this could be done, either by an increase in the rate of royalty or by an annual lump sum payment in addition to the royalty* I also put forward as a personal opinion that there might be a third alternative which might possibly and suit the Sheikh’s interests/would obzlously be open to very little objection from the Company’s point of view, 1 ' namely, that the amount of the minimum royalty to be paid in one year under Article 8 should be increased to, say, the figure that is at present actually being paid. The real advantage of such a solution would seem to be as follows. The main benefit which the Sheikh may expect to gain from the setting up of a refinery is an increase in the production of Bahrain crude oil. If all goes as planned this ought materially increase his income» On the other hand, after the refinery is set up, the Company might either cease to operate it, or they might find it more convenient to use other oil.e.g. from California or from elsewhere in the Middle East, and the production of Bahrain oil instead of increasing might decrease vc:,' conr..ich,rj.jly or practically couse. But an increase in the annual minimum to he paid in respect of royalty to about the figure at present being paid would safeguard the Sheikh to a large extent against this* However, the Sheikh might not be content with such a concession as it would not involve any immediate visible return* /it might of course be combined with a reasonable annual lump sum payment in addition to Royalties/. As regards provision being made to ensure that the Sheikh should not lose royalty on oil used as fuel in the refining of imported oils, it was suggested to Mr*Ballantyne that it is desirable to introduce forthwith some such amendment as he proposed into Article 7(a), i.e. to add such words as 'other than oil used in connection with the refining of imported oils'. He raised, however, a further point on this, viz: that it was conceivable that a natural gas might be used for refining, and that some provision might also be required under Article 7(c). It was agreed that this would need looking into and that probably what would be required would be a provision of a general kind added at — P the end of Article 7, e.g. to the effect that any Bahrain product coming under Article 7 which is used for refining imported oil should not be exempt from royalty. He stressed the probable difficulty of measurement in this connection owing e.g. to the possibility of oil from California being imported and mixed/mixed with Bahrain crude oil, and it was agreed that some sort of amicable arrangement would have to be arrived at. /^j\. if As regards Mr.Ballantyne’s redraft of Article 3 it was explained to him that we did not like this very much as it appeared to be rather vague. He was given for consideration a draft on the lines of the relevant Article in the Koweit Concession. A copy r of this draft is attached. It was explained to him that this was merely an indication of the sort of thing that might be accepted and might therefore save trouble. It might avoid raising suspicion in the Sheikh 1 s mind as it was on the lines of what had been accepted elsewhere. I added that so far as I, personally, could see it seemed to come to very much the same thing as the draft which he had produced. I was, however, not in a position to express an expert opinion on this# It should be noted that in a previous t elephone conversation it had been pointed out to Mr.Ballantyne that his redraft went very much beyond what we had anticipated from the previous conversation . What we had thought he had intended to do was to produce a redraft which would preserve the provisions of the present article and would add to them a provision regarding freedom from tax on profits. In reply to this Mr.Ballantyne said that his reading of the present article was that it did cover exemption from all taxation on everything required by the Company for their operations&gt; and that, e.g., the Company certainly should not pay license fees for motor cars and such like./like. It was made clear to him that that was much more than we held the Article to cover, indeed that his interpretation went clean against the plain English means, it is now evident that what Mr.Ballantyne has in mind in the present negotiations is definitely to secure for the Company in future a position in which they would he certain that they would not have to pay anything in the way of taxation etc. except royalties. At the close of the interview Mr.Ballantyne noted the points (a) about the royalty or other payment in regard to imported oil, and (b) the suggestion that the Company should pay for the extra concessions which they were asking from the Sheikh. He also promised to look at the alternative redraft of Article 3. In a further brief conversation today he sa_ that he had now ascertained that the general practice in regard to the treatment of imported oils was that they did not pay import duty on entry or export duty / after treatment, but that any treated oil which was sold in the territory where the refinery was situated was subject to some charge. It was pointed out to him that the general practice was perhaps not strictly applicable to Bahrain where the internal consumption of refined products would presumably be negligible, and in any case that one could hardly compare Bahrain with the United States of America or a European country. He suggested that possibly A.P.O.C. practice in Persia might be relevant. As regards the quid pro quo which it was suggested the Sheikh should have for concessions in regard to Article 3, he said (as was of course to be of the Article. But, whatever the present article expected)/expected) that he was quite sure, from preliminary conversations here, that the Company would not for a moment contemplate the idea of increasing the rate of royalty which was already extraordinarily high. He said, for my personal information only, that the Company had in fact originally included among their demands in this connection a proposal that in consideration for the r efinery being set up the rate of royalty should be reduced, but that he had dissuaded them! As regards the alternative redraft to Article 3 he said that as a lawyer he preferred his own draft and he did not think the alternative was a well worded article. He would prefer to stick to his draft as a basis. The actual wording of the redraft wouldbe a matter for consideration by the lawyers, but the main point was to get it agreed that the Company were to be free from all impositions except royalty. He suggested that we should now reply to his letters and he would refer to California. The general impression left by Mr.Ballantyne was that probably the Company, though they would not consider for a moment increasing the rate of royalty, might do sometiing, e.g. in the way of raising the minimum annual payments in respect to royalty as a quid pro quo for a general exemption such as they desire# M.J.

Dear Mr. Ballantyne, * Would ,ydu kindly refer to your letters to me dated the 12tn August in regard to the possibility of the erection of a Refinery in Bahrein by the Bahre.i ri Petroleum Company. discussions that before deciding to erect a refine the Islands, the Company wish to be assured (a) th present exemptions granted for 10 years under Arti of the Lease will be extended throughout the period of the lease and (b) that the provisions of this Article will be modified in such a way as to ensure that the Company will throughout the period of the lease be free from all forms of imposition relative to their operations under it except the Royalties agreed upon therein. 3. The Company, it is understood, are unable for their part to give an undertaking that the Refinery, if 2. It is understood from these letters and subs Ballantyre, -Ssq., he Bahrein Petroleum Co.Ltd., erected/ 11 Mincing Lane6 ./ si VO !? 2 . erected, would necessarily continue to be operated throughout the whole period of their lease, but they hope that it would at all times hereafter provide an outlet for Bahrein crude oil, and believe that the result of refining 'would be reflected in an increased production of Bahrein crude oil. 4. The Company’s proposition will of course have to be put to the Sheikh for his consideration, and His Excellency will no doubt vrish to have the advice of H.M.G. on the implications of the proposals before reaching a decision. It will therefore save time if certain points are cleared up at this stage. 5. The Sheikh, as is well known, desires to see a refinery established in his territory. But it is, I think, at least equally to the interest of the Company that a refinery should be established in a location so suitable in all respects as Bahrein. There has never hitherto, I believe, been any suggestion in the discussions which have taken place on the question, that the Sheikh should offer a quid pro quo to the Company for the establishment of a refinery in Bahrein.6. It w n n perhaps, be extravagant for the Company t ; that in the event of a Refinery being set ihrein the provisions of the present Article II'l should be extended to cover the period of the lease, for the reasons stated in the penultimate that in fact the Refinery would continue in operation for more than 10 years, as to which there is no guarantee. But the Company’s further demand that besides exemption from import and export duti^eind land tax as provided in the present Article III they should be exempt for all time from all taxes on income, profits, property etc. and all local taxes such as motor car licences, etc. seems to go very far and it would be difficult to argue that it would not be contrary to the interests of the Sheikh to consider granting such a wide concession without an adequate quid pro quo . I should add that in other similar cases in which we have been concerned where permanent freedom from duties and taxation has been, granted, paragraph of youur first letter: though this postulates the grant has been accompanied by an agreement to makeregular payments in consideration for tho exemption. 7. I would therefore venture to suggest that before the Company’s proposals are put to the Sheikh, they should consider the points referred to above and let us know in what respects they feel able to modify their proposals in the light of them. Two possible alternatives are an increase in the rate of royalty or an annual payment in addition to royalty. The first alternative may not commend itself to the Company, and it may be admitted that the present rate produces results which are not unreasonable from the Sheikh’s point of view, so long as the concession is worked on a substantial scale. The second alternative would probably be more feasible from the Company's point of view and would no doubt be satisfactory to the Sheikh. If the Compo-ny were reluctant to dispose of the matter solely on the basis of an annual payment, one possibility might be to combine such a payment, at a lower rate, with an increase in the minimum amount of royalty payable under Article 8. The minimum is in any case very small in comparison with other similar/5. J similar casss, and its increase could hardly be a matter of much difficulty to the Company, for the amount actually paid in royalty during the present year is, I believe, very much in excess of the minimum laid down, and the Company contemplates an expansion of crude oil production when a refinery is set «. as regards the wording of the article III 'which you enclosed with your second letter, this will have to be considered from the legal point of view. It appeared to us at first sight to be much too vaguely drawn, but I understand from you that the Company would not consider any draft satisfactory which consisted of specific rather than general exemptions, since this might prove to have loopholes and not to fulfil the intention of the Company, viz. that stated in paragraph ^regards the amendment of Article I regarding the pipeline, we anticipate no difficulty in making this. 10. Finally, there is the possibility, which has been discussed, that the refinery, which is understood to be intended by the Company for the treatment of Bahrein crude oil in the first instance, may subsequently be used 2 a/bove for/for treating imported oil also. In the first place, we think it might be convenient to deed, with the suggested amendment to Article 7 (a) at this stage, rather thou to leave it over. You ho.ve been good enough to point out that section (c) and perhe.ps section (b) of the article may also need amendment on the some lines. It would no doubt be safest to amend all three. It is agreed that the method of measurement to be adopted will have to be decided when the time comes. Secondly, it seems desirable that an understanding should be reached regarding the basis upon which crude oil should be allowed to be imported into Bahrein for treo/bment since under Article III as it now stands it appears that the Sheikh could cl^im to charge import duty at the ordinary rate. It would be useful to have the Company’s views on this point. In any event the Sheikh would no doubt wish to haye an assurance that the production of Bahrein oil jfrould not be allowed to_ suffer as a result of the importation of oil from other territories.

Dear Clauson, I write in reply to your letter P.4.6691/36 dated 13th August, on the subject or a rerinery at Bahrein, i liO / r In view of Starling’s letter or the 16th August the Admiralty would like to emphasise the importance, Xrom the Naval i&gt;oint or view, or securing a rerinery at Bahrein. Bahrein, being an island, is easily controllable by Naval rorcea and, moreover, la in territory which is virtually British, which means that British warahips could freely use the fuel in time of war, without any &lt;iueation of a breach of neutrality. No other possible location in the Gulf seems to combine these advantages. If, as seems possible, the refinery were to refine oil produced in other parts of the Gulf tie well as Bahrein oil, this would be an additional advantage. Presumably there would be no question about the power of the Sheikh, acting on our advice, to take over such oil in time of war. From the peace time point of view it would also be of great convenience to have oil fuel refined at Bahrein. The Admiralty therefore consider that every effort should be made to get this refinery built at Bahrein, and that any bargaining on the Sheikh’s behalf should not be pressed so far that there is any risk of the Company being frightened off. Ve do not feel that it would be safe to depend upon the argument that the Company are practically coin &gt;elieu to ut up a refinery by the difficulty of securing a market for crude oil. when we were / CUtuaon, Ks&lt;x., INDIA OPPICK, 3.

Birchin Lane, London^ E.C. 3. 30th August 1935. Dear JVir. Clauson, I have now received instructions to reply to your letter p.Z.58'00/35 oi the L3rd August, as follows;- its position is likely to he in tne future if it operates a Refinery in Bahrein with article III in its present form; looking at the matter from that point of view, I am to agree that your paragraph fairly sets out the position. 3. Your Paragraph 3 . It is correct to say that the Company coula not give, in practice, any undertaking that a Refinery would necessarily continue to he operate! throughout the whole period of its Lease, such a state of affairs would necessarily depend, as I hope you will appreciate, upon the result of sales. Of course, oil has to he sold before production is a practical proposition. 4. Your Paragraph 5 . I have to correct what seems to he a false impression you have that the physical location of a Refinery is the chief, if not trie only question to he considered hy the Refiners. I am to assure you that there are many other considerations to he taken into account, that of taxation being not the least. Your Paragraph 2 . The Company has in mind what Still/a Still dealing with your Paragraph 5, I am to agree with you that there nas never been any suggestion hitherto that the sheikh should offer a quid pro quo to the Company for the establishment of a Refinery in Bahrein. Neither is the Company now suggesting that the Sheikh should he asked to provide a quid pro quo to the Company for the establishment of a Refinery in Bahrein - the Company feels that it is reasonable and proper in the interests of both the sheikh and the Company for it to obtain a form of freedom from taxation which is as free as possible from ambiguity in the event of Bahrein being selected as the location for the establishment of that Article III covers only import and export auties and land tax; as this is not the time to debate on the construction of article III, I am merely to record that in the Company’s view Article III goes beyona the limit you appear to set. I am also to venture to suggest to you that if the sheikh were inclined to consider that the explicit assurance the Company asks for is not reasonable in the circumstances and that he should receive some additional recompense for such assurance, ^he might reasonably be askea to take into consideration l the large royalty of Rs.3.8.0 with which the Lease is ‘burdened, a royalty which, moreover, is a simple straigt- (Cjj* + forward annual tribute, unhampered by any restrictions ^ or conditions. 6. Your Paragraph 7 . The Company regrets that a Refinery. 5 Your Paragraph 6 . Ihe inference appears to be neither of the two alternatives suggested by you commends itself to the Company and I am instructed to inform that such is the case.I am to remind you in connection with your suggestion that tne minimum amount of royalty payable under article VIII is small in comparison with other similar cases and shoula be increased&gt; tna.t the existing minimum royalty was agreed after much discussion and that it is, in fact, an increase of the minimum royalty fixed when the Company tooiv the Concession® although the amount actually paid in royalty during the present year will be very much in excess of the minimum laid down by the Lease, if does not follow that the Company can sell or use the same quantity of royalty-bearing crude oil next year or in the following years. Accordingly, whilst the Company hopes that the output will be maintained and increased it must regard the amount of the minimum royalty payable each year as having considerable importance and value. If, however, the sheikh feels that he must receive recompense for giving the Company the assurance it asks for, then, whilst it feels that no such recompense should be asked for, it would be prepared to consider a further increase in the minimum royalty provided such increase is small. Here, may I say that the minimum royalty provides a real safeguard that the sheikh shall receive from the Company a certain income per annum should tne output of crude oil fall for any reason, ana therefore any Increase of the minimum royalty must have a very real value for the Sheikh and must, moreover, Impose a correspondingly additional burden upon the Company. 7® Your Paragraph 8 . The Company would prefer a clause containing a general exemption as one less likely to have loopholes than a clause containing specific exemptions. 8. Your Paragraph 9 . This is noted. 9 /. 4 - L i *4 - 2 , 9. Your Paragraph 10 . The way woula appear to he open, under Article III, for the Company to use royalty- free Bahrein oil in the treatment of imported oils, and also for foreign oils to come in to Banrein during the first ten years of the Lease, free of import and other duties. The Company feels that given the assurances asked for, it might well forego the privilege it feels it has at present of using Bahrein oil to treat also foreign oils and it has therefore suggested a possible modification of article VII. With regard to your ; c.b' suggestion that the sheikh should have an assurance that production of Bahrein oil would not he allowed to suffer as tne result of the importation of oil from other territories, I am to say that such an assurance can have no real value because the Bahrein oils must face the competition of other neighbouring oils and it would be impossible, in practice, to say how much Bahrein oil would have been sold if imported oils were refined else where than in Bahrein. Moreover, such an assurance, if given, might have the effect of keeping foreign oils away from Bahrein - some of which might well be essential for the purpose of blending with the Bahrein crude - with the result that an output for Bahrein crude oil would be lost. Furthermore, if any attempt were made to tax or otherwise charge oils imported for treatment and to tax or charge the export of the products of the hefinery, an impossible situation would be created and foreign oils would undoubtedly be shut out altogether. Yours sincerely, (3d. ) H.R. BALL ANT YNE. M.J. Clauson, Esq., India office, Whitehall, S.W. 1. Delivery.By Air Mail.Record of Interview with Mr. Ballantyne on September 5th . X Mr. Ballantyne called yesterday evening to discuss certain points Rising out of his last letter of 30th August. Colonel Fowle was present. 2. The first point discussed was that dealt with in the last paragraph of Mr. Ballantyne’s letter, viz. the question of the Company giving an assurance that the production of Bahrein Oil would not be allowed to suffer as a result of the importation of oil from other territory. It was explained to Mr. Ballantyne that possibly he had taken the proposed formula in rather too rigid a sense. It was a matter which had been raised by our technical experts, but so far as one understood the position, what seemed to be required was merely a statement by the Company that, other things being equal, if it were possible to meet an order for refined oil by refining Bahrein crude oil, then the Company would not go out of their way to import oil from elsewhere for a purpose for which Bahrein oil 'would do as well. Mr. Ballantyne said he thought he appreciated the point. Presumably, what the technical experts had in mind was the possibility of bringing oil say from Hasa to refine in Bahrein, with the conceivable result that at some stage less Bahrein crude oil might be used and more crude oil from Hasa. He did not see how the Company could possibly give an undertaking which would make it impossible for them to keep an even balance between the production of oil from various fields. The only practical/practical alternatives seemed to be either to say that no crude oil should be imported for refinirg in Bahrein, in which case the Company’s proposal for a refinery would probably go by the board, or to leave it open to the Company to preserve such balance between their various producing areas as commercial considerations demanded. He could not see that, in practice, the Company would be able to treat the Sheikh unfairly in a matter of this kind. It was in their own interest to work the Bahrein concession so far as possible to his satisfaction, but on the other hand he did not see how the Company could tie themselves up for 50 years by an undertaking the interpretation of which would, in any case, be a matter of the utmost difficulty. 3. He suggested, however, that this was really a matter which it was very difficult for anybody but the technical experts to discuss, and if we wished to press the point he would suggest a meeting within the next day or two between the experts concerned. It was agreed that this suggestion was reasonable in the circumstances. 4. The second point discussed was the question of increase in the minimum amount of royalty payable each year. After a good deal of discussion around the subject, Mr. Ballantyne said that while he considered it was a matter for the India Office to propose a definite figure, he was prepared to let us know that he had a definite maximum figure to which he was prepared to go. He mentioned this on the clear understanding that this was not to be regardedas a bargaining figure, but as a definite maximum. The Company were anxious to reach an early decision and therefore did not want to waste time bargaining, and it was only for this reason that he gave us a figure at this stage. The figure was, in iact, Rs.150,000. Mr. Ballantyne was informed that we would think over the matter and write to him on the subject. It was agreed that the suggestion of a figure should come from this side. 5. The third and last point discussed at the meeting was a point raised by Colonel Powle after looking at the papers here. It relates to the redrafting of Article 3 which the Company desire to be done on the basis of a blanket concession giving’ them exemption from all forms of taxation of every kind. Colonel Fowle held that the Sheikh might have some difficulty in persuading his family that a blanket concession of the kind suggested ought to be given to the Company, and that such a wide concession might come in for some criticism, from local public opinion in Bahrein which might not be able to understand why, lor instance, because a Company worked a refinery they should not, therefore, pay motor car licences! On the other hand, from the Company’s point of view the payment of such ordinary petty local taxes was not a matter of importance. The Company’s point of vie w in seeking a blanket concession was quite intelligble, since obviously it would be impossiblefor them to specify all the possible taxes which might, within the next 50 years, be imposed upon them. But equally there was no reason ior them to object to certain taxes being specified which the Company would pay. The revised article would then be to the effect that the Company should be exempt from all taxation except in respect of the following, viz? whatever small local taxes may be listed. Mr. Ballantyne said that this, of course, was not a matter that he could answer off hand, but that he d id not see any reason why the Company should not be quite prepared to agree to an arrangement of this kind if it would make it easier to obtain agreement with the Sheikh. This matter was left for further consideration by the India Office. 6. Before leaving Mr. Ballantyne again stressed the point which he has made before, that the Company should not be regarded as being bound in any way by these conversations to set up a refinery at Bahrein. He hoped it was quite clearly understood that the Company had not made up their mind at all as yet, and that all our discussions were on quite a hypothetical basis. Mr. Ballantyne was assured that this was quite understood and it was hoped that he understood that we on our side were not, in any way, ocmmitted to suggesting to the Sheikh that he should make any of the concessions under consideration, viz. the redrafting of article 3, etc., except in the event of the Company actually deciding to set up a refineiy Mr. Ballantyne agreed.

A copy has been sent to by All Mail.&amp; II'©IA OFFICE 6th September 1935. P.Z. 6305/35. Immediate. Dear Starling, y « Please refer/lo your letter of the 16th August No.P.D.21, Part 9 and connected papers about the yesterday that the Company are prepared to put the minimum annual royalty up to Bs.150,000. I thinh you agree with us that this figure - viz. double the present figure - is a reasonable and indeed generous one in the circumstances, and that the Company's refusal to consider an increase in the flat rate of royalty or an additional annual lump sum is not one that we can quarrel with. 2. In the light of the discussion with Ballantyne, you may now feel disposed to think that the demand we have made for an assurance that the production of Bahrein Oil possibility of a refinery at Bahrein. You will see from the record of the discussion here with Ballantyn would/ F.C.Starling Esq., Petroleum Department, Mines Department, S . Vf. 1.would, not be allowed to suffer as a result of the importation of oil from other territory might now be dropped. In any case the Company will obviously not consider giving any hind 0 . 1 - assurance worth the paper it is written on and a meeting of experts is not, I imagine, going uo get us ony further. However, this depends on v.liat you think, and I should be very grateful if you could let me know your view on Monday. ■^ s regards the redraft of Article In, it now seems quite clear that the Company are determined to get a 1 blanket 1 rather than a Specific 1 exemption in regard to taxation etc. So far as I can see the Koweit and Qatar ar tides amount in effect to complete permanent exemption and there is little to choose between them and the new article which Ballantyne suggests. As you will see from yesterday's discussion, Colonel Fowl© (who is on deputation at present) has suggested a possible method of improving the article from the Sheikh 1 s point of view.I 3. On this we have as^ed for the Acting Resident’s views. \ Unless you see/^bjection, we might perhaps accept Ballantynedraft (except that it ought presumably to end 'articles imported for the personal requirements of employees of the Company') with or without Fowls’s proposed addition. Since the Sheikh would be securing a decent quid pro quo it would seem reasonable to give the Company the wording they want. 4. As regards an impost on crude oil brought from elsewhere for refining in Bahrein, you have already said you do not think this practical politics and as you will see the Company have turned it down flat. I gather that your department definitely feels that this is not a point which one can properly press - indeed it might put the Company off altogether. I have only pressed it so far as I have for tactical reasons. 5. As regards the amendment of Art. VII, perhaps you would confirm that it would be safest to amend (b) and (c) as well as (a). 6 ./(o' 4. 6. Sulqjsct to your and Seal’s viev/s I would now propose at once to write to Ballantyne about the minimum royalty figure and then the way ought to be clear to put the whole thing to the Sheikh with our blessing. Meanwhile as you see from the copy I rtti sending you 5 I am suggesting to Loch that they might start preparing the ground with His Excellency or Belgrave. 7. I am sending a copy of this to Seal and to Rendel. Yours sincerely, (S&amp;d.) M' *&gt;••v/ Would you kindly refer to my recent conversations and correspondence with Ballantyne of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, about the possibility of a refinery being set up in Bahrein. The last paper was Ballantyne's letter of the 30th August, of which a copy was sent to you by the Air Mail of the 3rd September, P.Z.6169/35. 2. Fortunately Colonel Fowle has now arrived in London and has been into this matter with us. He is in general agreement with the line that we have been taking , and he was able to be present yesterday at the discussion with Ballantyne, of #iich a record is coming to you by this mail. IP' &gt; 3. As you see, Fowle suggests that a 'blanket' concession of the kind desired by the Company might more easily find acceptance from the Sheikh, if it was accompanie d by a statement of the specific taxes which the Company would be prepared to pay. He feels, however, c r that/ heHon»ble Lt. Col. P. G. Loch, C.I.E.,that this is a matter on which you are in the h^t position to give an opinion and suggests that you should he asked to do so. You may, of course, feel that in view of the quid pro quo which the Sheikh is receiving he would have no difficulty in accepting a ^blanket” concession. Perhaps you would telegraph what you think about this, as if we are to make an addition of this kind we shall have to get the Company's agreement and then a list will have to be produced. This last can only be done locally. 4. 1 do not know how far, if at all, the Sheikh or Belgrave have been informed of these recent developments All the papers have, of course, gone to Cole as v/ell as to you. The moment has now perhaps arrived when it would be well to approach the Sheikh in a preliminary way on the whole question as the Company are (as usual) in a great hurry and I gather will be making up their minds very shortly. We assume that he would welcome a refinery and that he would agree that the Company’s demand for a blanket concession in regard to exemption from taxation (with or without the addition suggested by Fowle) is a reasonable one. We also imagine that he would regard the proposal to double the rate of minimum royalty as generous. Certainly we here had very little hope/hope that the Company would agree to go beyond Rs.100,OOO in view of the great difficulty we had with them last year on the same question. 5. These then are the three cardinal points:- (a) Refinery, (b) Permanent complete exemption from taxation (? subject to specific exceptions), (c) Doubling of minimum royalty. As regards the other incidental points that have cropped up in the discussions, you will see from my letter to Starling of which a copy is being sent to you by this mail that these are mostly disposed 6. We shall, of course, telegraph to you officially on the whole subject when our negotiations this end are actually complete. 7.

On the question of an import duty on crude oil imported into Bahrein, our view definitely is that this is not a | \ point which should be pressed further but we ou^ht to make ^ exce P' fc ion (either by way of Fowle's proposed addition, or otherwise) in respect of imported crude oil or the products thereof sold for consumption in Bahrein. -/ 4. On .article VII it is not, I think, necessary to amend (b) and (c) as casing-head petroleum spirit and natural gas (neither of which the Company is under any obligation to produce) are not really affected by the proposal. The important thing is to secure the necessary amendment to (a).. Casing-head petroleum spirit could hardly be used 'in connectioc |f. ia Office, Charles Street, S.W.l.V- . 1 connection with the refining of imported oils” and the royalty on natural gas is a proportion of the field price received for its sale. 5.

Z. 6446/35. WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 14th Septeraher 1935. Dear Mr .Ballantyne , I can now reply to your letter of the 30th August in regard to the possibility that your Company may decide to set up a refinery in Bahrein. I do not propose to go further into the points dealt with in paragraphs 2, 3,4 and 5 of your letter, on which our respective positions are now clear. / V 1 2. Your paragraph 6. It is regretted that the Company would be unwilling to raise the rate of royalty or make, in addition to royalty paynents, a lump sum annual paynent. It is noted, however, that they would be willing to consider raising the amount of the minimum royalty payable each year. It is agreed that while sucn an increase would be of no practical value to the Sheika in present circumstances, it would - if reasonably large - give him a certain contingent safeguard against the danger of Bahrein crude oil production being neglected or supplanted. In this connection it is relevant to refer to paragraph 10 of your letter in which you indicate .Ballantyne, Esq., 11, Birchin Lane, E.C.3. , *5 that/that it would not he possible to give an assurance, as suggested in my letter of 23rd August, that the production of Bahrein oil would not be allowed to suffer as a result of the importation of oil from other territories. In the absence of such an assurance the question of the amount of minimum royalty payable is naturally of even more importance to the Sheikh than it would otherwise be. 3. It is understood that you would like us, on our side, to suggest a figure which might reasonably be put to the Sheikh in this connection. You have also indicated that the Canpany do not wish to waste time in bargaining and that what is required is a figure that is definitely regarded as one which might be thought fair both to the Sheikh and to the Canpany. In these circumstances it is not proposed to put forward a bargaining figure but one which we really consider appropriate - viz. Rs.150,000. While this figure does not cane anywhere near the amount actually being paid at present and while it would not be the kind of figure which in ordinary circumstances we should be disposed to suggest, it has the advantage of being double the present (as we consider, ludicrously small) figure and for thatreason might appeal to the Sheikh and he regarded as a real earnest of the Company’s desire to safeguard his interests in the matter of the concession so far as ccmmercial considerations permit.^ 4. Your paragraph 7. It is not desired in the light of your explanations to object to your proposed redraft of Article III, except that clearly the words at the end should read ’’articles for the personal requirements of the employees of the Company” (the articles may obviously be imported by the employees themselves or by the Company). As explained to you in conversation the Sheikh might however desire to add to this general exemption a list of ordinary local taxes which he considers the Company should pay (such small matters as, perhaps, motor-car licences). I gather that you think the Company might not object to this. ^ ^ 5. Your paragraph 9.~ — As regards amendment of Article VII, we now consider that amendment of (a) in the manner originally suggested by you would be sufficient, and that it is unnecessary to worry about (b) and (c). 6. As regards the question of our assurance about the production of Bahrein crude oil not being allowed to suffer (to which I have already referred in para.2 above)4. it is not desired in the circumstances to pursue this request, on the assumption that a satisfactory solution of the minimum royalty question is reached. 7. As regards the last sentence of your letter, we do not wish to pursue the question of taxing oil imported for treatment or exported after treatment. An exception should however he made in respect of imported crude oil or the products thereof sold for consumption in Bahrein, and presumably the Company would have no objection to paying tax on this. The matter could be covered in the list of specific taxes if such a list is in fact * added to the new Article III. 8. I think this covers all the points. It may be worth adding - though it is clearly understood between us - that our discussions and correspondence do not cormnit the Sheikh or the Company in any way. You on your side have made it plain that the Company had not made up their minds yet whether they wish in fact to establish a refinery. On our side we can only say that if the Company do make up their minds to establish a refinery an arrangement on the lines now contemplated would be such as we consider might reasonably be recommended to the Sheikh. Yours sincerely, M.J.Clauson.\\\, a^ Telegram R.27.

After coffee Shaikhs Rasbhid and Salman took their leave as they knew we had business. Shaikh ‘Abdullah unfortunately stayed on but it was impossible to dislodge him without giving offence. 2. After a few more courtesies I said that the Shaikh had always wanted and we had had discussions about a refinery in Bahrain. I said that the Company had now approached His Majesty’s Government saying that they were thinking of making a refinery possibly at Bahrain and explained to him the point at issue. I emphasised the danger of having a refinery at Q,atif or Ras Tanurah and also that if their oil were to be refined elsewhere and Hasa oil carried away by ship to be refined instead of being piped to Bahrain, we should inevitably have a port constructed 0 n t* 16 mainland. In general terms they seemed to agree to the proposal but in particular raised the question of the employment of Bahrain subjects. They admitted that a good many more U-v were employed in the cooly cla ss «*ki did not think that ' . * enough were employed in the superior clas^ such as motor drivers, clerks, etc* I said that it was difficult to get suitable men but they still pressed the point, for which there is something to be said. They also raised the question of existing taxes such as house tax and so forth. I made it clear that there would be no question of import duty or royalty on oil to be refined but that they would get their royalty on Bahrain oil used for- 2 - the purpose of refining Bahrain oil. Article III was read over to them and a certain amount of discussioi took place on general matters and finally it was decided that I should send the shaikh a letter giving he put it M my tongue mill -fre the tongue of Government'*, and he was evidently quite happy to accept anything that we could honestly advise.

No.07308 of 2/10/35).GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. ^ Confidential, No. c/ of 1354 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain, Dated, October 12, 1354- From The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain, To His Britannic Majesty f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, * I have the honour to inform you that His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin f Isa al-Khalifah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., has instructed me to write to you Hilly on the subject of paragraph 3 of your letter No. C/306 of 2nd October 1935, which refers to the suggested amendment of Article III of the Min i ng Lease which the Bahrain Petroleum Company wish to insert in the event of their erecting a refinery in Bahrain. 2. His Excellency is willing to agree that if the Company erect a refinery in Bahrain the privileges described in Article III of the Mining Lease shall continue in force not only for the term of 10 years from the commencement of the Lease but for the whole period of the Lease. The Company- 2 - The Company however requires more than this; it asks for the insertion of a clause which would absolve it from the payment of any form of taxes, tariffs or any kind of charges during the period of the lease. 3. The Bahrain government and the Bahrain Petroleum Company do not place the same inter pretation on Article III of the Mining Lease. My letter No. 302/20 dated June 20, 1935 addressed to you referred to this question, but I have not yet received a reply to it accepting this governments definition of Article III. In the opinion of this government, according to Article III, the Company is immune from payment of all taxes, duties, fees etc. which would normally be levied on goods at the time whai they are imported into Bahrain, provided that the imports are for the use of the Company f s operations. This is the meaning which appears to be clearly indicated by the use of the word 'enter' in the 9th line of paragraph 2, page 6. According to this interpretation the Company is liable to pay any other State or Municipal taxes which may be imposed by the Government or the Municipality. In fact, the taxes etc. which exist in Bahrain today, apart from customs duties, are few and very small and in the past they have been paid by the Company without demur until, about four months ago, Mr. Davies raised the question with me, verbally, of the Company^ liability to pay motor tax on the motor vehicles belonging to the Company. I gathered —I gathered from Mr. Davies that he considered that according to Article III the Company was not liable to pay the tax. If the Bahrain government’s interpretation of Article III is correct, the concession which the Company is asking is greater than the Company itself realises. 4. Because His Excellency wants the refinery to be in Bahrain he is willing to agree that at no time during the period of the Mining Lease shall the Company be liable to pay any taxes etc. except those which now exist and which the Company has been in the habit of paying. For this reason he does not agree with the wording of the proposed amendment as proposed by the Company which would render the Company free from the pay ment of certain fees, licenses and charges which are imposed in the interests of order and the administration of the country. I think that the persons viio composed the wording of the amendment cannot have been acquainted with the existing taxes etc. If the amendment were accepted with the present wording the Company would no loiter be liable to pay certain fees vhich are charged for services actually rendered. As an extreme example the Company could fill the customs sheds with their goods, free of charge, and they could continually use the customs porters and the crane without payment because according to the amendment they would not be liable to pay crane fees, porterage (hamali) or rentor rent for storing goods in the customs sheds (Khanchieh). 5* The existing taxes etc. can be divided into two headings, State taxes, and Municipal taxes. State taxes . i. Motor vehicle tax. ii. Boat red. strati on fees, on launches and sailing boats. iii. Pearling licenses. iv. Motor driving licenses. v. Pish trap registrations. vi. Stamped paper and lease forms. No sales, leases, powers of attorney etc. are recognised by the government unless they are made out on govern ment forms. There are also certain customs charges which are actually payment for services or facilities afforded by the customs which in the past have been paid by the company when it has utilised these facilities. Hamali fees. Payment to porters. Khanchieh. Kent for occupying customs sheds if the goods are left for more than a certain period. Crane fees. For use of customs cranes. Certificate and amendment fees. Charged for alteration and amend ments on customs documents. Municipal taxes. i. House tax. ii. Shop stall and market tax. iii. Cart tax. 6. His Excellency considers that the Company should not be immune from payment of any of —any of the above taxes for which they might become liable, but if, in the opinion of the British government, his insistence on this point vail result in preventing the company from making a refinery in Bahrain, he is prepared to reconsider the question.

Bahrain Government are, however, willing to give 'blanket* clause to cover future provided that Company agree to continue to pay following, some of which they already St ate Taxes , i.

These taxes may toe increased or diminished in the ordinary course of the progress of administration, but would be applied without any discrimation and clearly could not be made punitive as they apply to the general public. 6. It will be seen from the last paragraph of the .Adviser 1 s letter that if in the opinion of the British 3-ovemraent, his insistence on this point will result in preventing the Company from making a refinery in Bahrain, the Shaikh is prepared to reconsider the question of the taxes mentioned in paragraph 5 above. I hope, however, that it will be possible to persuade Company to accept paging these taxes, which represent only a small sum but to which fchaikh attaches sentimental importance. The blanket* clause is so valuable a concession, as protecting them against any possible future harsh taxation, that X feel that it would be politically sound for the Company to meet the Shaikh in these rather trifling matters. 7 . There is one further point on which I understand that /-4 that the Bahrain GoYermaent will addreas me shortly# The dhaikh is anxioue to know whether the Company has any form of ’sales agreements 1 with competitors in connec tion with the sale of oil 9 petrol and so on in Bahrain# He naturally wishes that his people should benefit from a local refinery by getting petrol and other products cheaper then the present imported rates and wo Id be glad to be informed of the position in this respect# sd# G# Loch, Li eut #-Colonel# Officiating Political Kesiaent in the Persian Gulf. &gt;:t tested. C for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf#Copy for Colonel Fowle . Pa r&gt; 0 . Zs^s-s, ‘J- - J/ - ' d ' I am, as you say, in general agreement with the line the India Office are taking. The outstanding facts are that we want the Refinery for naval strategic reasons, the Sheikh wants it for financial reasons - more local labour employed and increase of output of crude oil - and the Company want it on commercial grounds. It is therefore now a question of making the best bargain for the Sheikh. 2. The Company (as you point out in paragraph 6 of your letter of the 23rd August to Mr. Ballantyne) are going far in asking for exemption for all time from all taxes , in return for the erection of a refinery. The Sheikh and his family, which includes at least one very shrewd individual, the Sheikh Abdulla, know as well as we do, that the Company are not philanthropists, and would not consider working a refinery at all unless it was in their own interests. They will, therefore, not be very enthusiastic at giving such a blanket concession as asked for by the Company. Further, as always when dealing with Sheikh^ the/2 . t-lie psychological point of view has to be considered. Such a wide concession may come in for some criticism from local public opinion in Bahrein which the Sheikh (and ourselves as his adviser) would have to face. Such opinion would not be able to understand why, for instance, because a Company erect a refinery they should therefore not pay motor car licences! On the other hand, from the Company's point of view the payment of such petty taxes may not be of importance. 3. I see the Company's point of view in seeking a blanket concession: they would be easier in their minds if they could get it. But I think, perhaps, it might be easier to persuade the Sheikh to meet the Company half way, if the latter were to make a list of the taxes they would prefer to pay and no others. 4. Naturally the Company have no detailed knowledge of local taxes. I suggest Colonel Loch might be asked to give his opinion as to whether it would be easier to induce the Sheikh to agree to a blanket concession, or one on the lines indicated in my preceding paragraph. When Colonel Loch's opinion has been received he could be instructed to approach the Sheikh. If the latter raised objections to the blanket concession Colonel Loch could/(£&gt; * i 3. « could supply a list of the local taxes, 5. With regard to the offer of the Company (as given in paragraph 6 of Mr. Ballantyne's letter of the 30th August) in return for the blanket concession from the Sheikh: i.e. a small increase in the minimum royalty. This is apparently the most we can get out of the Company, and is at any rate something, in view of the fact that the refinery would benefit the Sheikh as well as the Company. 6. With regard to the cognate question of the pipeline from the Hasa coast to Bahrein which 1 discussed with you; the situation apparently is that the Company are not prepared to discuss it at present. From this I presume that the Bahrein Oil, in itself, is sufficient to make the refinery a paying proposition, having regard to the present difficulties which the Company find in marketing crude oil. Otherwise, if the refinery depended on oil from Hasa, the Company would not be prepared to commit themselves to the erection of the refinery until the pipeline question had been settled. When and if the Company wish to make their pipeline to Bahrein, they can only do/do so, of course, with the permission of the Sheikh and he should be able to extract some benefit from granting it.

We understand from Starling that at the meetings now being held in New York it is probable that the market position of the Standard Oil Company of California is under review in conjunction with other oil interests concerned.

So far as it is possible for us here to elucidate th.e facts of a somewhat obscure situation, we are inclined to think it would Be inadvisable for the Admiralty to give the desired undertaking to the Company. \7e suggest, therefore, that the reply should Be to the effect that, whilst the Admiralty would welcome the establishment of an oil refinery at Bahrein By v/homsoever it was erected, we could not undertake to purchase a fixed annual quantity; But that if and when oil of a suitable specification Becomes available at Bahrein we should Be prepared to consider it in competition with other suitable sources of supply.

P.Z.7523/35. 1st November 1935. r . |0 Dear Mr. Ballantyne, With referen our correspondence ending with your letter of the 18th September regarding' the possibility of a refinery in Bahrein, I write to let you know that the whole matter has been discussed in a preliminary way with the Sheikh by the Political Agent, It appears that in the event of the Company actually proposing to set up a refinery \ he would welcome its establishment. He would have no objection to the refining in Bahrain of oil from outside, but would not wish that the quantity of oil which is produced in Bahrein should diminish. He asked that the Company should be reminded about Article XVII of the Mining Lease and he would hope that if a refinery is made more employment would be given to his people in Bahrein. He would be prepared to extend the benefit of Article III to the end of the period of the Mining Lease and would be prepared to have this made into a blanket clause, as proposed, provided that the Company pay the following specific taxesJ \ State/ Ballantyne, Esq., Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited, 11. Birchin Lane, E.C. 3.State Taxes i , Motor vehicle tax. ii. Boat registration fees, on sailing boats. launches and iii. Motor driving licences. iv. Fish trap registrations. V.

Customs charges for services or f acidities accorded. i. Hamali fees. Payment to porters. ii.' Khanchieh. Rent for occupying customs sheds if the goods are left for more than a certain period. iii. Crane fees. For use of customs cranes. iv. Certificate ) Charged for alterations and amendment) and amendments on customs fees. ) documentso Mu nicipal T axes.• i. House taxo ii. Shop, stall and market tax. iii. Cart tax. These taxes may be increased or diminished in the ordinary course of the progress of administration, but would be applied without any discrimination and clearly could not be made punitive as they apply to the general public. They represent only a small sum, but the Sheikh appears to attach considerable/considerable sentimental importance to therm It is very- much hoped 9 therefore 9 that the Company will see no difficulty about acceding to the Sheikh’s request in this matter. It is definitely felt that it would be politically sound for them to do so. There is also 9 of course 9 the point which I mentioned in paragraph 7 of my letter of the 14th September 9 ^o. P.2.6446/35 9 about taxation of imported crude oil or the products thereof sold for consumption in Bahrein. 2 , I understand that it is possible that we may be hearing from you shortly about a definite decision by the Company. If so, you will see that the ground is ready for a formal telegram to be sent to the Gulf. It would no doubt be desirable at the same time to make it plain that the Company would accept in principle the payment of these specific taxes. It would also probably be necessary to explain to the Sheikh, with reference to his wish that the quantity of oil which is produced in Bahrein should not diminish, that, while the Company are unable to give any formal assurance that production will be fixed at any specific amount, since this matter depends entirely on commercial considerations, the fact that they have agreedto double the minimum royalty figure shows that tney have no intention of neglecting the production of Bahrein oilo Yours sincerely 9 ^ Blfei,J.

The Company note that the Sheikh would welcome the establishment of a Refinery in Bahrein and they are pleased to be able now to say that having regard to the understanding referred to in paragraph three of this letter and to your letter P.Z.6446/35 of the 14th September, they have decided tof establish a Refinery in Bahrein. 5. The Company understand that there shall be no freedom from taxation on imported crude oil or the products thereof sold for consumption in Bahrein. 6 . It may be explained to the Sheikh, with reference to his wish that the quantity of oil which is produced in Bahrein should not diminish, that while the Company are unable to give any formal assurance that production will be fixed by any specific amount, since this matter depends entirely on commercial considerations, he shouldV 2 . be re-assued that the Company have no intention of A, neglecting the production of Bahrein oil and that as an earnest of this they have agreed to double the existing minimum royalty. 7. The Company are proceeding forthwith to put into operation their plans for a Refinery in Bahrein. 8 . Will you please let me know when you have cabled to the Gulf as the Company desire to publish their decision so soon as you have done so with a delay of a day or two to permit of the news being formally 1 communicated to the Sheikh by His Majesty’s Government. 9 .

Dear Mr. Clauson, I send herewith 12 copies of the draft of a Deed giving effect to the terms which have been concluded between the Sheikh of Bahrein and this Company to modify the Lease of the 29th December, 1934, consequent upon the determination of the Company to construct a Refinery in B ahr eiri'v A You will see I have not referred in the Deed to the determination of the Company to construct a Refinery- in Bahrein. I have omitted this because I think it was understood that it was not necessary formally to record that fact. If, after further consideration, you think it should be inserted as one of the conditions upon which the freedom from taxation is granted in the form proposed, by all means insert it. In recording the proposed alterations you will see I have kept as nearly as possible to the phraseology of the letters which have passed between us. The sole departure from such phraseology I think occurs in the new Article III, being the exception A 2 (c). You will see that I have put the words 'or the products thereof' within brackets so as to make it quite clear that we are referring to oil sold for consumption in Bahrein as well as the products/Iproducts of oil sold for consumption in Bahrein. The relative letter has the meaning quite clear hut standing as the exception does in the Deed stripped of explanation, I think the brackets are necessary to avoid possible ambiguity. If the draft as I send it to you is approved, I assume you will send copies to the Officials in Bahrein. If you would let me knov/ when you do-so, I will at the saee time send copies of the Deed to the Company's Officials in Bahrein. I assume that as rega rds engrossment of the Deed^ and the execution of it, the same procedure will be followed as on the occasion of the engrossment and execution of the Lease, namely, the Deed will be put into Arabic, explained to the Sheikh of Bahrein and then engrossed in three parts in the Arabic and English languages, the three parts being executed by all parties. The Company will Seal with its Common Seal if required but that vi 11, of course, take time and I suggest that the Deed be signed by the Company’s Officials, namely, the Chief Local Representative and the Manager, acting collectively under Power of Attorney in the form of the Power of Attorney used for the execution of the Lease.

De ar Mr. B all antyne, Would you kindly refer to your letter of the 29th November, 1935, (-which I am sorry not to have answered before) enclosing a draft deed for modifying the 1934 lease of the Bahrein Petroleum Company. We have decided that on the whole it would be desirable to insert a reference to the determination of the Company to set up a refinery, and we would accordingly propose to put in a new clause as follows: '(A) The Company shall proceed to establish forthwith a refinery at Bahrein.' (A) and (B) of the present draft vfould then become (B) and (C), and (A) in the third line of the new clause (C) would become (B). Perhaps you would kindly let me know if you agree to this modification. We presume that you will see .R. Ballantyne, Ksq., Bahrein Petroleum Company, 11 Birchin Lane, E.C.3,2 . © iii no objection to the word 'forthwith', as the Company are already, in fact, putting their determination into word we could no doubt substitute something li.£e 1 as soon as possible 11 . We have already sent advance copies of the draft deed to the authorities in India and in the Gulf, and when this point has been cleared up we shall, I think, subject to any further observations which they may have to make, be able to have the draft submitted to the Bahrein Government for its consideration. But if you should have any objection to the Yours sincerely,P.Z. 758/36 INDIA OFFICE WHITEHALL, S.W.l 7-g 1 31st January 1936. a y air mail. I ) In the course of conversation with Ballantyne the other day I understood from him that there was a possibility that the Bahrein Petroleum Company might be getting some of their plant for the refinery in Germany. The purchase will probably be on a kind of barter principle, a market being thus obtained for some of the Company’s oil. The plant is, I understand, called M S.0.2 plant”. Ballantyne said it can only be obtained satisfactorily in Germany and that the A.P.O.C. had bought it for their Abadan refineries. In order that this plant should be efficiently set up and that the peimanent staff of the Company might be properly instructed in its use, it would, he understood, be necessary to send two men (Geimans) from Germany for the erection, and two for the instruction of the staff. This would mean that for anything up to twelve months there would be not more than two Geimans in Bahrein. Hon. Lt.Col. T. C. Fowls , C.B.E. , 1 / The Residency, Bushire.2 . I spoke to Starling about this and he confirmed what JBallantyne said about the plant. he also gave it as his opinion from the technical point of view that it would not be possible for His Majesty^ Government to deny a claim by the Company that German experts from the manufacturers were necessary for the efficient erection of the plant and instruction of the Company^ employees. From the political point of view I imagine it is hardly desirable to have Germans in Bahrein, even temporarily, but it looks as if it might be impossible to avoid. Perhaps you might be considering, in case a formal application is put in by the Company or the Chief Local Representative for visas for such men, whether any conditions or stipulations should be made in respect of them, e.g. that they should not leave the island during their visit, or that their movements should be restricted within a certain area. I am sending copy of this letter to Acheson and T. AConfidential, D«0.No«146-S of 1936. The Residency, Bushire, the 19th February 1936 /Will you please refer to your letter No# P.Z# 758/36, dated the 31st January 1936, on the subject of two German experts who are to assist in the erection of the refinery at Bahrain. In the circumstances explained, and as ae -&gt;’ will not be on the Company’s permanent staff, I see no objection, and I do not think that any further conditions or stipulations need be made for their employment than already exist for the other employees of the Company. 1 am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe * and Loch M.

Dear Mr. Clauson, With reference to my letter to you dated the 4th February on the subject of the draft Deed to modify - ... the Mining Lease, in which I asked that the draft should, now go forward to completion, I gather from you over the telephone this afternoon that your understanding is that I was to write to you asking that the proposal you put dfa forward in your letter P.Z.928E/35 addressed to me under date the 1st January to modify the draft, by adding a new clause, as followsi- '(A) The Company shall proceed to establish forthwith a Refinery at Bahrein 11 should be modified by substituting 'as soon as practicable' for 'forthwith', and so that the new clause you suggest would read:- '(A) The Company shall proceed to establish as soon as practicable a Refinery at Bahrein.' I am sorry that owing to a misunderstanding on my part your consideration of the new clause has not been proceeded witn. I should be glad if, on receipt of this letter, you 'would consider the Company’s suggestion and let me know whether or not you can accept it. I think I should add that the modification I suggest on behalf of the Company is promoted by a desire to protect the Company from possibilities of delay unfoi eseen at the moment and not by a desire to slacken Clauson, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.Iin its efforts to construct and operate a Refinery at Bahrein as soon as practicable.

Dear Mr. Clauson, I refe^ to the second paragraph of your letter P.Z.8151/35 y of the 14th November last. You say in that letter that you understand the Sheikh of Bahrein is anxious to know whether the Company has any form of 'Sales Agreement” with competitors in connection with the sale of oil, petrol and so on, in Bahrein. You add that the sheikh naturally v/ishes that his people should benefit from a local refinery by getting petrol and other products cheaper than at the present imported rates and would be glad to be informed of the position in this respect, and you ask that the Company should give you any information it can on this subject. As I informed you on the telephone on the 6th January last, this company has replied to your enquiry to the effect that it expects to be making kerosene and other petroleum products at the Bahrein Refinery by the early part of 1937 which it is now free to sell in Bahrein at prices to be fixed by itself. In other words, the Company is not involved at this time in any cartel or agreement to sell or not to sell products of the gahreln Refinery at any fixed price, I also informed you that the company will continue to keep in mind so far as its ability extends, the best interests of the Sheikh and his Subjects and therefore, in M.J. clauson, Esq.., India Office, Yfhitehall, S.W.l.2. answering a general question oiT iJiis lnind 5 tne Company reserves to itself entire liberty of action in the marketing of both the natural and manufactured produce.

Also discussed is the Company’s interest in securing further tax exemptions from the Bahrain Government in relation to establishing a refinery; an agreement to increase the minimum amount of royalty paid by BAPCO to the Bahrain Government; and the desire of the Shaikh of Bahrain to ensure that every effort would be made to employ Bahraini subjects at the refinery once complete.Other matters discussed in the volume include:BAPCO’s intention of loaning American refinery construction workers from the Standard Oil Company of California to work on construction of the refinery at Bahrain, and arrangements with the British Consul-General in San Francisco (Cyril H Cane) for the issuing of visas to the relevant individuals;the drafting of a deed which would modify the mining lease between BAPCO and the Government of Bahrain in order to enable the erection of a refinery in Bahrain, and the procedures required for its signature in Bahrain. A copy of the original mining lease can be found at folios 6-16, and a copy of the deed modifying the lease can be found at folios 167-170.BAPCO’s intention of attempting to acquire some of the plant for the refinery from Germany and the need for the plant to be accompanied by 2 Germans to assist in its erection and to oversee the training of BAPCO staff in its use.A series of file notes which were maintained as a record of the correspondence in the volume can be found at folios 213-217.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum refineries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Taxation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00028f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
