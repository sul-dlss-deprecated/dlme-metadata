VThile believing that reliance on the Party will lead to betterment in wages and working conditions, they seem to disregard the dangers of dismissal. As the source phrases it, ‘’May God help the ungrateful Indians who may have to revert to India on four annas and six annas a day wages'. The informant expresses the opinion that these Indian employees are now more pro-Soviet than pro-British in outlook. 2 * Information from Kuwait points to attempts to spread Tudeh ideas among employees of the Kuwait Oil Company and the likelihood of strikes for better conditions* Soviet influences are seen at work and numerous agents are known to be employed on the Perao-Iraq and Syrian borders. Though our informant had not actually come across subversive literature in Kuwait, such is knoY»n to be in circulation. 3. An informant employed by a British concern in Baghdad gives a somewnat similar pejiture of the course things are taking in the Rafidain^Oil Company, with which his fiirti maintains close touch. -he employees of the Khanaqin Company are full of sympathy for the Abadan strikes and admire them for the stand they have taken.

Among the passengers on s.s. ,, BARALA U which arrived from the Persian Gulf on 22 August, were between 80 and 90 Indians, mostly men proceeding on leave and belonging to the Oil Company or otherwise employed at Abadan. The general opinion among them was that while about two-thirds of the Indian employees had been adversely affected by TTJDEH propaganda, they were now afraid to show their feelings or to make trouble because of the example made of M.A.FAROOQI and his companions, and also because of the show of firmness by the Tehran Government. Sympathy was, however, expressed for the five men dismissed as a punishment for*joining the TUDEH Party. 2. These workers confirmed the report already submitted (v. 4/MIK/l dated 24th August, para 5) concerning the strike of Indians at Abadan on 4th August and also that the object was largely to discredit Shaikh ASGHAR ALI, Asstt. Director of Labour at Abadan. 3. It was admitted by these passengers that at least half the Persian population of Abadan is pro-Russian and that they have not tecin influenced by propaganda or money but because, they believe, Russian friendship will save Abadan from the Arabs. 4. Among the Indians on s.s. 'BARALA 1 *, were a number from KUWAIT of whom six were said to have been dismissed by the management of the KUWAIT OIL FIELDS under circumstances similar to those in the Abadan dismissals. Their names and occupations are:- i) RAF I MUHAMMAD (Turner) ii) KHUSHI MUHAMMAD (Turner) iii) MUHAMMAD SHARIF (Electric welder) iv) FEROZ DIN (Motor Mechanic) v) MEHRAJ DIN (Deisel Engine Fitter) vi) BASHIR AHMAD (Bench Fitter). Addresses not known at present. Touch was established with these who, while not openly admitting dismissal, said enough to confirm that they had, in fact, been dismissed. 5. S.S. ,, BARJ0RA n arriving in Karachi on 23rd August, brought an interesting rumour to the effect that Shaikh ABDULLA, a son of the late Shaikh KJIAZAL of Muhammerah, is planning a raid on the Abadan Area, with the idea of driving out the Persians and in this he is counting on British aid and the sympathy of the Shaikh of Kuwait.

I enclose a copy of a very good note by my Confidential Clerk which gives information about it up to 1946. It appears that none of our sources are earlier tiian that. Yours sincerely C.D. Belgrave, Esq., CBE, Adviser to the Bahrain Government BAHRAINThe Tudeh Party from its inception some time during the period mid 1942 to early 1943 has been Russian-inspired and more or less Russian-directed and Russian-aided. Its doctrines however are only very loosely communistic, a M com munism' tempered to Persian conditions. It advocates the democratic reform of the Persian constitution and champions the lot of the Persian worker. Its doctrines, in fact, are more socialistic than communistic. In this however it is following the usual communist tactics of using parliamentary methods 'while the proletariat is preparing itself for the xxiitd crisis'. It early made for itself allies among the politicians of the Persian capital, capitalists who found it impossible to run their businesses without its co-opearation, disaffected Army Officers, 'Princes' of the pre-Pahlevi dynasty, and, in some districts, even landowners. Many of these persons were at tracted to the Party by a 'nationalism' that meant, in effect, an opposition to all British and American interests in Persia, especially the A.I.O.C. and theAmerican advisers in the various departments of the Persian Government. The main sphere of the Party’s activities however is among the trade unions and industrial workers of Persia. In their organisation and indoctrination it has met with marked success. After the occupation of Azerbaijan by the Persian Army and the suppression of the Abadan riots the Persian Government made a determined effort to crush the Tudeh Party ani to break its hold over Persian workers. The * Party has suffered many prestige defeats but it is by no means dead. Che Tuddh Party is still very much in the nature of a 'Trial horse' for the Russians. Its members are a very mixed lot and the Russians have not hesitated on occasion to withdraw their support from the Party, force it to come to terms with the Persian Government, and condemn its activities. Che degree of Russian support has depended apparently on the plan chosen for execution. In the Abadan riots the Pud eh Party leader received very full instructions from his Russian contacts - his captured correspondence included a voluminous mass of papers and letters in Russian - and the Russian Consular representatives on the spot continually hampered the efforts of the Persian Government and A.I.O.C. officials to take action against the rioters. In Azerbaijan the Tudeh Party formed only one element in the Azerbaijan Demokaat Party sponsored by the Russians (not to be confused with the Iran Democrat Party founded by the former Persian Prime Minister Qavam as Sultaneh) and composed of rudeh Party officials, Persian Army deserters, and persons unwilling to return to Persian Government misrule. The Russians have also, where they thought- 2 - fic, made a direct appeal to the different sections of the Persian populati m or have worked through organisations and persons opposed to the fudeh. From the Russian point of view this has helped to discipline a Party in which there are many bourgeois elements. It has proved itself to have considerable nuisance value, it has recently purge! itself, and it is the only Persian party which can claim 'to have prepared the people to accept communist leadership more readily during a revolutionary crisis 1 '. The rudeh Party has not been an unmixed evil to Persia. Party members have exploited the situation to their financial benefit, but in a land of corruption, mismanagement, and feudal organisations, tne rudeh Party has helped to introduce much needed reforms and to expose the fraud and misrule of Government officials. They have helped to improve the lot of the industrial worker and have made the villages politically conscious. In Azerbaijan the work of rudeh Party officials during the occupation has received favourable notice from the British pressmen who accompanied the U«N.O* observers on their tour of the country.(9 \ 70 SECRET.

In Azerbaijan the Tudeh Party formed only one element in the Azerbaijan Demokrat Party sponsored by the Russians (not to be confused with the Iran Democrat ^cii*ty founded by the former Persian Prime Minister ^avam 4 as Sultaneh) and composed of Tudeh Party officials, Persian Army deserters, and persons unwilling to return to Persian Govt, misrule. The xtussians have also, where they thought / fit,fit, made a direct appeal to the different sections of the Persian population or have worked through organisations and persons opposed to the Tudeh. From the Russian point of view this has helped to discipline a Party in which there are many bourgeois elements. It has proved itself to have considerable nuisance value, it has recently purged itself, and it is the only Persian party which can claim 'to have prepared the people to accept communist leadership more readily during a revolutionary crisis'. The Tudeh Party has not been an unmixed evil /G* to Persia. Party members have exploited the situation to their financial benefit, but in a land of corruption, mismanagement, and feudal organisations, the Tudeh Party has helped to introduce much needed reforms and to expose the fraud and misrule of Govt, officials. They have helped to improve the lot of the industrial worker and have made the villages politically conscious. In Azerbaijan the work of Tudeh Party officials during the occupation has received favourable notice from the British pressmen who accompanied the U.N#0. observers on their tour of the country. activities in the Array and the various districts of Persia is treated in the pages of PICMR reports fagged be'low.

C.J. Felly, Esq., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. ConfictaaiiaL BAHRAIN RECEIFlCOPY The Political Agency, Kuwait. No.C/87(7/7). 16th April 1?49. Dear Sir Rupert, Please refer to my Savingram No.C/71(1'V9) of the 5th April, 1949. 2. A question that arose in the course of Dr. Akopiantz's differences of opinion with the Kuwait Government was whether or not His Highness could be su*ed by a foreigner subject to the Kuwait Order in Council. Dr. Akopiantz’s contract was with His Highness himself. 3. The question might arise again if Dr. Akopiantz, after taking legal advice in the United States, modifies his present intentions and tries tc institute a suit in Kuwait. It might also arise out of the employment of other Non-Muslim foreigners (such as Indian doctors); and I think consideration should be given to the question now. 4 . Ordinarily civil suits instituted by a person subject to the Kuwait Order in Council against a person not subject to it are admitted by the Political Agent and disposed of in accor dance with the procedure laid down in sub-para 5 of Section 52 of Part V of the Order-in-Council. The conditions in which ruling chiefs could be suid in the Courts of British Indi^ are laid down in Section 86 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Act V of 1908). 5 . My view is that permission to sue the Shaikh himself or in the name of the State should not be given. 6 . It is desirable, however, that at any rate British and British Protected employees should have some remedy in case of disagreement. They will expect us to assist them in such circumstances. It would meet the case if we coul^ get included in their contracts a clause appointing the Political Agent as arbitrator in case of dispute. If the Shaikh would not agree to this in respect of foreigners, he might agree to their con tracts being made with the Head of the Department responsible for paying them, and to their being allowed to su4 him (the Head of the Department) under Part V of the Order in Council, although this might not give them much protection. We are unlikely to be able to do much for those employees who do not consult us before appointment. 7. Perhaps you would let me have instructions row about the admission of suits against the Ruler so that I may know the position if Dr. Akopiantz returns to the charge or if any of the Indian doctors comes to me for assistance against the Health Department. Yours sincerely, G.N.JACKSON. H.E.

(Dear Jackson) Please refer to your letter No.C/87(7/7) of the 16th April. I agree with the opinion expressed in para 5 that permission to sue the Shaikh himseif or in the name of the State should not be given. 2 With reference to the suggestions made in para 6 T apree that when any British subjects are recruited through us we should endeavour to get a clause inserted in their contracts appointing the Political Agent as arbitrator in case of dis pute. It will be impossible to get this done in respect of persons recruited direct unless they consult us about their contracts. 3. Generally speaking I consider that the Political Agent should so far as possible use his good offices to bring about a settlement of disputes between persons subject to the crder- ,in-Council and the Kuwait Government. In the case of Dr. Alkopiantz if he submits a formal application asking for your intervention you should do what you can to assist him if you consider he has any reasonable grounds for complaint, other wise you should inform him that his application discloses nothing which would justify your intervention* and advise him to accept the position with the best grace he can. Yours ever, (W.R.Hay) G.M. Jackson, Esq., Political Agent, Kuwait.S.O.No.C/R-201 De?r Sir Rupert, POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, The 11th May 1949 Contracts offered by the Bahrain Govern ment to Indians and Pakistanis are not submitted to us for approval before signature and the only pro vision they contain regarding the settlement of disputes is that they should be submitted to the Adviser. 2. I entirely agree with the line taken by you in your letter No.(149/27/49), dated the 23rd April 1949, in reply to Jackson's letter No.C/87 (7/7), dated the 16th April 1949, about Dr. Akopiantz's case. It seems to me that there is no alternative to treating the case as a political one and there is no question of 'sueing” the Shaikh. It also seems to me that Dr.Akopiantz's or any other similar case is weakened by the fact that he did not in the first place conclude his contract under the auspices of the Political Agent. 3. The orders in Government of India despatch No.D.839-N/32, dated the 2nd March 1932, are of interest in this connection, if you have not already seen them.

Jackson, Esq., M.B.E Political Agent, Kuwait.No.C/89-(13/9) The Political Agency, Kuwait. April 16, 1949. Dear Sir Rupert, Please refer to my Savingram No.C/71(19/9) of the 5th April 1949. 2. A question th-it arises out of Dr. Akopiantz’s case is thet of the extent of our responsibility for the protection of American interests in Kuwait. 9 . We appear to have acquiesced to the American Consul at Basra looking after certain aspects of American interests: he comes here to deal with their passports, an^ he is to be invited to observe proceedings in Crim'ina 1 cases in which Americans are involved - Residency letter No.12/8/49 of the 11th March, 1949. This does not extend, however, to his havinr any dealings with the Shaikh except through the Political Agent; and we do not appear to have admitted that he is solely respon sible for protecting United States interests. Were we to do so and to refuse to accept responsibility ourselves we should later find it very difficult to maintain our resistance to the esta*- • lishment of an American Consulate here. i 4 . In Dr. Akopiantz’s case the Arrerican Consul refused to in terfere on his behalf; and Dr. Akopiantz repeatedly as^ed for our protection of his interests. 5 . If American citizens have a good prima facie case (which I gather Colonel Galloway did not think Dr. Akopiantz had) I think we should do as much as we can to help them; but I should be grateful f or your instructions. Yours sincerely, G.N. JACKSON. H.E. Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.SECRET. (214/2/49) PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN. 9th April 1949. (Dear Jackson) Please refer to Galloway’s savingrarr No.C/55( 13/9) of the 24th March. 2 . I concur in the action so far taken I a'i not quite sure however that I agree with the views expressed in paragraph 4 of -the savingram. As a last resort Akopiantz could presumably institute a case under Article 52(5) of the Kuwait Order-in- Council. We do not want him to do this and it is preferable that the case should be settled out of court. Should the Uni ted States Consul be brought into the matter, he would pre sumably deal with the case through the Political Agent and not direct so that it will not make much difference whether he is brought into it or not. Possibly the case has already settled itself by this time, but all I want to emphasise at present is that we should be chary of insisting on the formal intervention^ of the United States Consul in cases of this nature though it may well be desirable to keep him informed of the progress of events and perhaps to consult him before coming to a decision. 3. I hope to discuss this case and its implications with you during my forthcoming visit to Kuwait. Yours ever, W.R.HAY. G.N.
