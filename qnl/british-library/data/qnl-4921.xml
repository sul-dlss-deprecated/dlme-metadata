[E 6949/32/34] Iraqi-Persian Boundary Question. Narrative of Events, No. 5. Geneva, September 1935.— {Communicated by Mr. Edmonds; Received in Foreign Office, November 28.) AS recorded in my last narrative I returned from Tehran to Bagdad with Nuri Pasha on the 28th August by air. I left again by air on the 3rd September, reached London on the 7th September and Geneva on the 11th September. Mr. Fachiri travelled to Geneva on the same day. Nuri Pasha with Nusrat Beg A1 Farsi, Director-General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, had arrived on the 9th September. 2. While the instructions for the Iraqi delegation to Geneva were under consideration in Bagdad, I prepared for the Council of Ministers a short memorandum on the case for Persian participation in a Conservancy Board in the Shatt-el-Arab. A copy is attached as Appendix A, for convenience of reference. 3. At Geneva direct negotiations were conducted with the Persians on the following four subjects, which can best be discussed separately:— {a) Formula for the adjournment of the Iraqi request. {b) Tripartite Treaty of Non-Aggression, to include Turkey. {c) Treaty for the Pacific Settlement of Disputes. {d) Treaty of Friendship, to cover the boundary settlement. Of these, of course, the Treaty of Friendship was the most important—indeed the matter which took the delegation to Geneva; it will, however, be discussed last since less progress was made with it than with the others. (A)— The Adjournment. 4. On our arrival at Geneva we found that the Persian delegation was sedulously spreading the impression that complete agreement had been reached on the boundary question, and that the Iraqi request was being withdrawn. M. Kazemi even told his own legal adviser, M. de Lapradelle, that a number of treaties and agreements, including a navigation and conservancy convention, had already been negotiated, and that it only remained for the legal advisers of the two delegations to meet and put the texts in proper legal form. 5. On the 19th September Mr. Fachiri met M. de Lapradelle with a view to composing a letter to the rapporteur asking for an adjournment. Mr. Fachiri had prepared a draft (Appendix B( x )). M. de Lapradelle stated that the Persian delegation would refuse absolutely to include the word c ‘ adjournment.’' Indeed for some days the situation was in some way reminiscent of that at the January session, when the rapporteur was unable to present a resolution at all because the only sentence in his many drafts on which the parties could agree was : “ Pays a tribute to the spirit of moderation and friendship shown by the two parties.” M. Kazemi went as far as to allege that Nuri Pasha had promised the Shah to withdraw the request, but collapsed under cross-examination. 6. Contact was established with the Italian delegation on the 19th September, and a copy of Mr. Fachiri’s draft was sent to Baron Aloisi on the 20th September. 7. On the 24th September M. Kazemi produced a counter-draft (Appendix B (ii)), which was objectionable in that it gave a misleading picture of the actual state of the negotiations, and might cause some surprise to the members of the Council if the request is again put on the agenda.

It wls agreed that it should be left to the ro VV orteu^ t0 P r°SigLl he ScadX e »iLunicated a tW—Ws draft report to the oarties on the morning of the 27th September. The Iraqi delegation had no difficulty accepting the draft as it stood. M. Kazenu insisted on an alteration ■of the last sentence w^ich originally ran : “In these c.ro—ces^ / « meeting the desire of hath -parties by proposing that the Council should adjourn the x he report (Appendix C) was adopted by the Council on the 28th September.^ ^ of conversat i 0 n M. Kazemi had stated that he proposed to make a speech at the Council meeting. Fie promised two or three days earlier, to communicate a copy in advance to Nuri Pasha; the promise was not kept. It seemed clear from his conversation that, haying failed to get a misleading letter to the rapporteur, he proposed to give the impression in his speech that all was settled. Nuri Pasha therefore prepared a short speech for use if necessary (Appendix D( 1 )), and informed M. Kazemi accordingly. M. Kazemi then agreed not to speak. The President of the Council seemed hardly to be able to believe his ears when both the representatives stated they did not wish to speak, not even to pay the regulation tribute to the rapporteur (which of course had been paid in the joint letter). (B)— The Non-A ggression Treaty. 12. I recorded in my narrative of events at Tehran (paragraphs 15-19) that the Turkish Government had urged Iraq and Persia to settle their differences as soon as possible in view of developments in the European situation, and that the Persians had put forward a draft tripartite “Treaty of Friendship and Security.” The idea was resumed at Geneva and negotiations were pushed forward pari passu with those for the boundary settlement. 13. On the 19th September the Persian delegation communicated a draft non-aggression treaty (Appendix EQ), which differed somewhat from that communicated at Tehran (Tehran narrative, Appendix T). 14. In the meantime the Iraqi delegation had prepared a more elaborate draft treaty of non-aggression and pacific settlement of disputes based on the model treaty of non-aggression prepared by the Committee on Arbitration and becurity in 1928 (League Document C.342.M.100.1928.IX, revised in Document A.20 of 1928). This was communicated to the Persians on the 20th September M. Kazemi in reply intimated that, since Persia already had a treaty of pacific settlement with Turkey, he would prefer the two parts to be separate, the first for signature as a tripartite treaty with Turkey, the second as a bilateral instrument between Iraq and Persia. This was accordingly done. The resulting short Iraqi draft non-aggression treaty is attached as Appendix F.( 3 ) ^ j ^ e pf em ber, on the initiative of the Iraqi delegation, it was auanged that from the 23rd September onwards the two delegations should meet daily round the conference table with a view to agreeing on the texts of this and nLLtef !r mg slmultan eously negotiated. M. Kazemi excused some nro-'reT M iC* 3 ^ P e ™ anej \ t officials and legal advisers met and made ITb Nn?f pkn M -*F r mi an k hlS ^legation failed to keep the tryst on the deWatioT T M here /° re ’ addressed an indignant letter to M.

The Turks were anxious that the non-aggression draft should be completed. Nuri Pasha also felt that for psycho logical reasons it would be useful if texts of the non-aggression and pacific settlement treaties could be agreed upon. The passages of Nusrat Beg and myself were therefore cancelled at the last moment. We stayed till the 30th, when -I left for England and Nusrat Beg went to Paris to report progress to Nuri Pasha. A T usrat Beg returned to Geneva on the 2nd October. 17. It would be superfluous to reproduce the drafts as they stood at various stages of the negotiations; the text of the draft non-aggression treaty as initialled by M. Kazemi, Jemal Husni (Turkish Minister at Berne) and Nusrat Beg on the 2nd October is attached as Appendix G. It may, however, be of interest to notice some of the points that arose during the discussions. 18. The principal preoccupation of the Iraqi delegation was to ensure that the treaty should be consistent with the Covenant of the League, the Kellogg Pact for the Renunciation of War, and the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance (it will be noticed that the Covenant was nowhere mentioned in the original Persian draft); this point is reflected in the Iraqi draft preamble, which was accepted, in article 9,. and in article 4 (see paragraph 20 below). 19. Article 3 of the Iraqi draft, providing for mutual consultation in the case of international complications, was intended to meet, in a more restricted manner, the desire underlying article 3 of the Persian Tehran draft; the Persians cut it out, apparently without knowing exactly why, and later asked for its reinclusion in a rather more embracing draft; its final form was more restricted than ever. 20. Article 4 was first recast as an article renouncing aggression (and including a definition of aggression), rather than denouncing recourse to war, in a Persian counter-draft of the 24th September. Definition No. 4 of acts not constituting aggression is intended to cover action by Iraq under the Anglo-Iraqi alliance. 21. Article 5 provided an interesting example of the Persian desire to restrict the role of the organs of the League as far as possible. To meet a Persian objection to the original Iraqi draft that a victim of aggression could not sit passive, a new sentence was added : ‘ ‘ The foregoing provision shall not be deemed to prejudice the right of such high contracting party to take any measures it thinks necessary fending the result of the afplication to the Council^ The Persians resisted to the last inclusion of the words italicised, with their impli cation that action after promulgation of the Council’s decision should conform to that decision; the words were eventually omitted; such omission, of course,, cannot affect any obligations arising out of the Covenant. 22. Article 7 first appeared in the Persian counter-draft of the 24th September and read: “Les hautes parties contractantes s’engagent a prevenir dans leurs limites respectives la formation de bandes, associations on organisations, quelles qu’elles soient, de nature a troubler I'ordre et la securite de leurs territoires ou a porter atteinte a leur regime respectif de gouvernement. This was considered too sweeping to square with the Iraqi Constitution; and the text ultimately accepted includes restrictive definitions of bands, associations and organisations. 23. At the last moment it was suggested that the treaty should be open to the adherence of Afghanistan. I am not aware if the Afghan representative was consulted. On the 30th September the Persians produced a draft protocol pro viding for such adherence, but it was not included in the text initialled. The draft, with copy of a letter written by Nusrat Beg to M. Kazemi in this connexion, is attached as Appendix H.^) 24. It will be observed that on the Iraqi side the draft was not initialled ne varietur, but with an endorsement to the effect that the Iraqi representative would recommend the treaty as drafted to his Government. (C )—-Treaty for Pacific Settlement. 25. There is little to be said regarding the Treaty for the Pacific Settlement of Disputes. The Iraqi draft in English is attached as Appendix J-O The Erench text as initialled is attached as Appendix K^ 1 ) The only discussion had ( x ) Not printed. [565 ee—1J B ^0 4 (D )—Treaty of Friendship. 27. Accordingly, on the 17th September, a draft treaty (Appendix L( )) \\as handed to M. Kazemi. This draft was discussed with him on the 18th September On the 20th September M. Kazemi presented a counter-draft (Appendix Mf 1 )). Negotiations were conducted pwri passu with those for the treaty ot non- aggression already described. It is, therefore, only necessaiy to comment on, and record progress made with, each article. The state on the 2nd October will appear from Appendix N. . 28. Article 1. An interesting paradox attracted attention, under the Covenant it is now impossible for a State-member to undertake to maintain “perpetual peace” with another State (as was provided in the Persian draft). It may undertake to maintain “ sincere and perpetual friendship with its neighbour, but must reserve a loophole to dissemble that friendship by kicking him downstairs at the bidding of the League. The Iraqi draft was taken from the existing treaty with Afghanistan. A text was agreed upon (see Appendix N). 29. Article 2. The Persians demurred to a suggestion that the privileged position of the British Ambassador should be recorded in an exchange of letters (following the precedent of the Afghan and draft Italian treaties); they pointed out that the rank of the Persian diplomatic representative was now that of Minister Plenipotentiary, and that such an exchange of letters would more appropriately take place if and when it was desired that this status should be raised to that of Ambassador. It is hardly possible to contest the logic of this . reply, and the exchange of letters was not pressed for. 30. The Persian draft had an article 3, not corresponding with any article in the Iraqi draft, providing for reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment for travellers and residents. The Iraqi delegation agreed to include such an article, subject to an addition providing for true reciprocity in the details of treatment (Iraqi legislation being much more liberal than Persian). To this the Persians would not agree. It was pointed out that the subject covered by the proposed article could appropriately be left to a future residence treaty, and so not be allowed to hold up the treaty of friendship. The omission was agreed to. Aiticle 3. The Persian taboo of all mention of 1914 invnlv*ic&lt; n rmmHpT‘ delimited for^hTfh^t^^. that th ? was being eliminated from the text agreed ibe the boundary from north to i sian draft treaty communicated ( l ) Not printed.at Tehran), and even to start demarcation from the north; the intention is presumably to make the description in outward appearance as different as possible from that incorporated in the proceedings of 1914. In the Iraqi view, since the 1914 line is the line agreed upon, there is a grave risk of discrepancies if a new description is accepted (indeed, the task of reversing a detailed description of a Jong land boundary is a tour de force of a difficulty that can hardly be realised 3y anybody who has not tried it); furthermore, it seems absurd to attempt to make the elaborate arrangements required for the Demarcation Commission at a remote and inaccessible place in the mountains instead of in the plains and within reach of large towns. It is true that part (b) of the Iraqi description, that of the Shatt-el-Arab sector, where the 1914 alignment is to be modified, is drafted from north to south. There are certain drafting advantages in this arrangement, which follows the precedent set by Baron Alois! in his May proposal (May narrative, paragraph 12, appendix E), but there would be no great harm in .reversing the direction. (c) The Persians, who in the first place objected to the presence of a neutral member of the commission at all, endeavoured in their counter-draft to reduce his status from that of a president to one almost resembling a camp-follower; he was only to participate when officially and formally called in to decide cases of disagreement. My experience on the Syrian Boundary Demarcation Commission convinces me that such an arrangement would not work. There is no reason to believe that a Persian representative would show more common sense and desire to co-operate than our French colleague on that occasion. With a third party present the numerous minor decisions to be taken daily, such as daily programmes of work, choice of camp sites, position of pillars, formation of sub-commissions, are taken almost unperceived, unobtrusively, and without friction; without his presence trivialities are liable to become major causes of dissension. {d) The Persians objected to the mention of the maps prepared in 1914. 33. It was naturally at article 5 (Persian draft 6) that the negotiations reached a deadlock. The Persians were anxious to tie up the Shatt-el-Arab arrangements so closely with the definition of the boundary that, for all time, the two should stand or fall together. They therefore insisted that an article must be inserted in the treaty covering the Shatt arrangements as an integral part thereof. There was no such article in the original Iraqi draft, for the following reasons : The Iraqi conception of the proposed Conservancy Board differed profoundly from that of the Persians as indicated in annex 2 of their draft; agreement at Geneva was out of the question; it could only be reached at Basra itself, where the representatives of the parties could be assisted by their experts and visualise the arrangements in situ\ until the differing views of the parties had been in some degree reconciled, it would be difficult to find, for insertion in a treaty, even a general form of words to cover two widely differing conceptions; in any case, while the treaty settling the boundary question and the convention for the Shatt-el-Arab should, of course, have equal sanctity and validity in international law, it was on principle undesirable to combine in the same treaty a boundary settlement which could remain unaltered for all time, and arrange ments of a practical nature which might require modification to meet changing circumstances or as the result of technical developments. Attached as Appendix Of 1 ) for convenience of reference, as an attempt to define the policy of the Iraqi Government as laid down in the instructions to the delegation, is a draft article prepared by the delegation at Geneva but not used. 34. As regards the details of the Shatt Convention, it is only necessary to mention here that M. Kazemi continued to show himself strongly opposed to the participation of the United Kingdom as an actual party to the convention, or even to any mention of the British nationality of the proposed neutral member of the board. 35. Persian article 7, enumerating the other treaties and conventions to be concluded between the parties, would be, in view of its ephemeral nature, really quite out of place in a treaty of this kind. A revised list, which the Iraqi Government would, nevertheless, have been prepared to insert if pressed, i&amp; attached as Appendix P. 36. Persian article 8 would be unnecessary, the matter being covered by .article 7 of the treaty of non-aggression. ( 1 ) Not printed.6 ^ 9 nri Optohpr when the texts of the two 37.

The view has for long been consistently held in this Legation that an agreement between Iraq and Iran regarding the Shatt-el-Arab will only be attained by providing the Shah with a sop in the form of frontier rectification opposite Abadan. It became clear during Nuri Said Pasha’s farewell audience of the Shah that such rectification was an essential prerequisite to agreement. The matter is therefore one which touches His Majesty’s personal pride and if he is eventually to be induced to agree to redefine the frontier exactly as before with this one exception, it seems obvious that the exception must be impressive enough for him to represent to the Iranian people that something substantial has been gained in the bargain reached. I can hardly believe that anything less than a strip 100 yards wide will satisfy the Shah. Actually, I understand that the Iranian Government still hanker after the thalweg opposite Abadan. 3. So long as the Tripartite Conservancy scheme forms part of the settle ment, I can see but little risk in transferring the sovereignty over the Abadan strip to Iran. This strip would still remain under the administration of the Tripartite Board. 4. For these reasons I should hesitate to jeopardise the chance of a settle ment of the whole dispute for a few yards more or less of the waterway opposite Abadan, and I should be inclined to favour offering, eventually at least, the maximum considered safe by Colonel Ward. 5. I remain sceptical of the idea that Iran intends to create a “naval base ” at Abadan, though probably the Iranian naval commander intends to set aside a wharf there for the use of his warships. Mohammerah, now called Khoramshahr, seems a much more likely place for a floating dock. 6. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, No. 93. PERSIA.

It will Ue remembered that the chief interest of His Majesty’s Government in this dispute centres around the extent of the anchorage at Abadan, which it is proposed to concede to the Persians in return for their recognition of the 1914 frontier, and the establishment of a Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board, in which His Majesty’s Government will have an effective voice. As far as these points are concerned there is little progress to report, since the file was last submitted at P.Z.4946/35 at the close of the May Session of the League* Negotiations were resumed at Tehran in August, an account of which will be found in Mr. Edmond report imaadriately Ailow.

The discussions which took place there in September are summarised in the Foreign Office letter at P.Z.7413/35* and the Foreign Office memorandum at P.Z. 7693/35* The issue has been further complicated by the introduction of proposals for a three-power non-aggression pact to which Turkey would be a party and a bi-lateral Treaty for the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes between Persia and Iraq; in addition to the proposed Treaty of Friendship to which the definition of the frontier, and possibly the Conservancy Board Convention will be annexes. Negotiations will be shortly resumed at Baghdad, but there has been a good deal of confusion both in regard to British participation ; which the Persian Government have not yet formally accepted, and in regard to the agenda which is to be discussed, i.e. whether the Conservancy Board Convention is to have precedence over the Treaty of Friendship or not. The Foreign Office are* dissatisfied with the position (see P.

WITH reference to your despatch No. 531 of the 15th October last, regarding the proposed treaty of friendship between Iraq and Iran, I have the honour to inform you that the Tehran press announces that negotiations will shortly be resumed at Bagdad by a delegation headed by the Iranian Minister there, M. Samii, who is expected back from leave in about ten days’ time. 2. Experts are being sent to Bagdad from here to assist M. Samii. The first of these, M. Fathullah Noury Isfandiary, is well known to your Department, having been Charge d’Affaires in London. He is now head of the Fourth Section in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and is well-disposed and pleasant in manner. The other expert is M. Javad Ameri, head of the department for drafting laws at the Ministry of Justice. 3. The counsellor of the Iraq Legation, who came to see me this morning, is mildly optimistic about the mission. He thinks M. Samii more courageous than M. Kazemi, although he says that unfortunately Nouri Said Pasha does not like him. 4. The Minister for Foreign Affairs before leaving for Kabul received the Iraqi Minister and described to him the progress of the negotiations at Geneva. M. Kazemi said that he was prepared to admit British participation in the Conservancy Board, but he did not apparently say that Great Britain was to be a party to the negotiation and signature of the convention. 5. In conversation with the counsellor of the Iraqi Legation, M. Noury Isfandiary mentioned the thalweg as the Iranian desiderata in the strip to be transferred opposite Abadan, and Dr. Naji-el-Assil replied that if he really wanted to succeed in Bagdad he had better not mention the thalweg. 6.

Narrative of Events—Bagdad and Tehran, July—August 1935.— {Communicated on September 25 by United Kingdom Delegation to the League of Nations; Received in Foreign Office, September 27.) ’ NURI PASHA returned to Bagdad from Europe on the 5th July, and consideration of the boundary question was resumed. On the 24th July, aj committee of the Iraqi Cabinet was formed of the Prime Minister and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and of Justice, to draft instructions for the Iraqi delegation to Tehran. 2. I prepared for this committee a series of eight memoranda on various aspects of the question, as follows :— No. of Attached as Memo. Subject. Appendix. 1. Definition of the boundary ... ... ... ...

At the meeting of the 3rd August the Council of Ministers passed the instructions for the Iraqi delegation. 4. On the 3rd August the Director-General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Director of the Eastern Section,. Colonel Ward and myself left by road. We reached Tehran on the 5th. Nuri Pasha and Muhammad Zaki Beg, Minister of Justice, arrived by air on the same day. 5. Conversations began on the 7th August, and were continued on the 8th and 10th. The general impression conveyed by Mr. Kazemi was that:— (a) Persia was ready to recognise the land boundary as it stood. (b) Persia would be content with practical benefits on the Shatt-el-Arab and did not want a change of the Shatt boundary, would give a verbal assurance to that effect, but would not give any document; Persian honour must be saved; it was a case of finding a formula. On the morning of the 10th August Mr. Kazemi suggested to Nuri Pasha that he, the latter, should ask His Majesty’s Minister to invite His Majesty’s Government to suggest a formula; Mr. Kazemi did not divulge that he had in fact already made this request himself the previous day. As regards the practical benefits, Nuri Pasha invited Mr. Kazemi to submit a statement of Persian desiderata. 6. On the 10th August I prepared a memorandum, No. 9 (Appendix K( 1 )) exploring the possibility of avoiding a redefinition of the boundary in a new instrument, but disposing of the question by implication through the practical conventions : the Neighbourly Relations Convention should provide for demar cation of the land boundary as a measure for facilitating the smooth working of its other provisions; the Convention for Co-operation in Customs and Police Matters on the Shatt-el-Arab should be so drafted as to make clear that the facilities offered were granted by the Iraqi Government in virtue of that convention. Settlement on these lines, of course, presupposed the bona fides of the Persian attitude as defined by Mr. Kazemi. p) Not printed. [515 dd—1] B7 On the 11th August Mr. Kitzemi sent m as nis aesiaerata (see paragraph 5, last sentence) a draft of a Treaty of Friendship (Appendix L(')) together with a draft Bilateral Conservancy Board Convention (Appendix M(')), and a redefinition of the land boundary from north to sou h ( ppendix N (■)). (The definition in the 1914 proceedings is from south to north.) Ihe draft was unacceptable for the principal reason that article 5 of the treaty attempted to define conditions in the Shatt-el-Arab in such a manner as to leave the question of sovereignty entirely vague; and the Conservancy Convention, which also covered police and customs matters, was so worded as to imply a median-line boundary, 8 Nuri Pasha, after explaining to Mr. Kazemi that his instructions did not allow of his negotiating the text of a treaty, but only of agreeing on the general lines of a settlement, handed to him, on the evening of the 13th August, the draft of a 'proces-verbal, to be initialled by the two negotiators, laying down in some detail the principal provisions of the series of conventions that were to constitute the settlement (Appendix 0( 1 )). 9. On the 14th August Mr. Kazemi professed himself as profoundly shocked by the mention in the yroces-verbal of the Treaty of Erzerum and the other instruments. On being assured that these allusions could be omitted, he professed Uimcolf fri Ko willinor frt fnlrA CHa draft a Q tflA basis of nAOntiatinn He did, how- 1 AVligUSt 1VAT. XVctXCiiJLi iixmocxx cxo px vxx^lxxixxij oxxuxaveu by the mention in the 'proces-verbal of the Treaty of Erzerum and the other instruments. On being assured that these allusions could be omitted, he professed himself to be willing to take the draft as the basis of negotiation. He did, how ever, object to the mention of the third British member of the Conservancy Board and to the inclusion of the Persian portion of the Naft-Khana oil structure in the oil arrangement; he further stated that parts of the provisions of the Neighbourly Relations Agreement were not consistent with the Persian policy of abolishing the tribes. 10. The Iraqi delegation was taken for a long week-end to Mazanderan. There were no conversations on the 15th, 16th and 17th August. 11. Conversations were resumed with a certain liveliness on the 18th August. The Iraqi Cabinet had telegraphed that a redefinition of the whole boundary must be an essential part of any settlement. Mr. Kazemi while refusing to admit in writing that Persia did not want to change the boundary on the Shatt, would not allow i\uri Pasha to telegraph that the Persian Government wanted a change. Mr. Kazemi then proposed that the settlement should be sought without mentioning the boundary at all. Superficially this resembled the procedure discussed in my memorandum No. 9 (see paragraph 6 above); but, as there stated, this presupposed the bona fides of the Persians when they stated that they only wanted to a\ oid a public recantation on the issue of the validity of the treaties. &amp;c., and to save their faces. The whole course of the conversations, however, had i e i e - rs ^ ns n °k retreated one inch from their original position; a xu? onl y desired to compromise the strong Iraqi position on the legal issue; and that no agreement was m sight on the main point at issue. The possibility TYiAAH^a 168 at Abada f 1 in exchange for compensation in the north was first mentioned m passing at this interview. Pri Au ^ ust ’, at request of Mr. Kazemi, Nuri Pasha saw the step forward Mr V eroa Sh 1 - The interview seemed to mark a very definite of the whole hrmnrla ^ 1 in f 1] E a ^ e d that Persia would agree to a redefinition that the practical bM ^ llver, u A . ade( l uate &amp; uarantees were forthcoming boundarv P vmul 1 d a ^^e 1 w^ U b emeI K S, offered to Persia to recognise the Iraq Nuri Pasha invited S M Se&lt; ^ ilently u AltllciraWn by the un i latera l action of purpose a mVlted Mr ‘ Feroa ghi to submit a formula adequate to his the h^pitality 1 -that^ha^ been^avLhed^p^n^^^^N 1 a ban ^ et in return for (Appendix PI 1 )) which x i a P oa lt - ?suri Pasha made a short speech was strictly justified bv the course of ^hen* &amp; p°p rathe f , more optimistic than interview uninfluenced bv anv binri Ar e ne g°tiations.

They were disillusioned, but with some difficulty. 15. On the 20th August also it was learned that the Turkish Government was following the negotiations with the greatest interest. M. Aras had telegraphed to Yasin Pasha and also, it was understood, direct to the Shah, urging that the opportunity of settlement offered by the presence of the Iraqi delegation in Tehran should not be lost; once the dispute was settled the three middle-eastern Governments could proceed to conclude a tripartite treaty of security and non-aggression; it was suggested that, in view of the European situation, such a development would be regarded with approval by His Majesty’s Government. 16. Although some of the permanent officials of the Persian Foreign Office were understood to be still of opinion that a formula could be found on the lines discussed in the first interview with Mr. Eeroughi (paragraph 12 above), the position as between the protagonists was one of complete deadlock (paragraph 13, last sentence). On the 22nd August, therefore, Nuri Pasha wrote a letter to Mr. Kazemi (Appendix Q) recalling the circumstances in which he had come to Tehran, summarising the course of the negotiations, and expressing disappoint ment at the lack of progress, together with a hope that the Persian Government would still be able to propose an acceptable formula; in conclusion, he asked for an audience of the Shah to take his leave. 17. On the 23rd August Mr. Kazemi, while promising to answer Nuri Pasha’s letter as soon as possible, stated that he was most anxious to conclude at once two treaties, of non-aggression and neighbourly relations, the latter to provide for the redemarcation of the land boundary; he promised to send drafts the next day. This proposal appeared to offer some prospect of reducing the openings for friction, again on the lines discussed in my memorandum No. 9 (Appendix K( 1 )), paragraph 4. His drafts were therefore awaited with interest. 18. On the morning of the 25th August Mr. Kazemi sent the promised reply (Appendix R) to Nuri Pasha’s letter of the 22nd. It simply denied each and every statement made. 19. At the same time there arrived, as promised, two draft treaties; but there was no mention of neighbourly relations or of a redemarcation of the boundary. The first draft (Appendix S( 1 )) was described as a “ Traite d’Amitie,” and the second (Appendix T( 1 )) as a “ Traite d’Amitie et de Securite.” The only articles in the two drafts in any way relevant to the matter which had brought the Iraqi delegation to Tehran was article 2 of the second treaty, which ran : “ Les hantes parties contractantes se garantissent I’inviolabilite de leur frontiere commune.” 20. At 5 o’clock the same afternoon Nuri Pasha had an audience of the Shah. It had always been anticipated that the Abadan anchorage might prove to be the deus ex machina, to unravel complications at the last moment. These anticipations were in some measure realised. Nuri Pasha, as he deplored his failure to come to any agreement with the Persian Ministers, contrived to hand to the Shah a Persian translation of his letter of the 22nd August, to the manifest discomfiture of Mr. Feroughi and Mr. Kazemi. The Shah, having read the letter, stated he was ready to accept the existing boundary, land and river, and that he only wanted the anchorage at Abadan. Mr. Kazemi interposed to interpret the offer as referring to the thalweg boundary from Mohammerah to Bawarda, as proposed by the rapporteur in May. Nuri Pasha, however, elicited from the Shah confirmation that he asked for no more than “ 1 or 2 kilometres ” at Abadan itself. 21. On the 26th August we returned to Bagdad by air. The text of the agreed communique is attached as Appendix U^ 1 ) It was agreed that direct negotiations should be resumed at Geneva. C. J. EDMONDS. September 24,1935. p) Not printed.

Great care must be taken to ensure : (q\ xhat it is made clear that Iraq still considers the existing treaties, protocols and proceedings as binding until they are replaced by a new instrument duly ratified according to the present day constitutional requirements of the two countries. (V) That for the interpretation of the description recourse shall be had to the maps drawn up by the commission of 1914. (c) That any rights reserved to either of the parties under the existing instruments referred to above shall be safeguarded until they are abrogated by or incorporated in new agreements. These three matters might be mentioned in an exchange of letters. 4. The Iraqi delegation should avoid any discussion regarding territorial waters or the direction of the boundary towards the sea from the last point mentioned in the description of 1914 {i.e., the point 2 miles down stream of Sheikh Khazal’s fort, situated almost due east of Fao), until such time as agreement has been reached on the rest of the line. It seems possible that early in the Tehran negotiations the Persians may make a feint on the flank by putting forward certain grievances with regard to the alignment of the land boundary, and claiming minor rectifications. The claims will presumably not be pressed, but to prevent waste of time and effort the Iraqi delegation should be ready with their counter-grievances. Directly it is seen that any proposal to rectify the land boundary would be unprofitable it would presumably be abandoned. (Secret.) Appendix B. Persian Boundary : Memorandum No. 2. Rectifications of the Land Boundary.be leased to the people of Mandali. The best solution would be for Persia to cede Saumar to Iraq. (c) The decision by which the boundary left the crest of the Hewraman range near pillar 83 so as to leave Hewraman Luhun to Persia has created an unnatural boundary east of Halabja, which has led to friction. The boundary should follow the crest of the Hewraman range till it reaches the Little Zab just upstream of Hajij. (d) The enclave of Persian territory which projects into Iraq south of Zurbatiya is unnatural and the line should be straightened. (Secret.) Appendix C. Persian Boundary : Memorandum No. 3. Neighbourly Relations. The aim of the Iraqi delegation should be to provide for a Neighbourly Relations Agreement, which shall cover generally the matters mentioned in— (a) The Draft Agreement for the Regulation of Frontier Relations approved by the Council of Ministers on the 6th December, 1931 (see Council of Ministers’ letter of the 23rd March, 1932, sent to the Iranian Minister, Bagdad, under Minister for Foreign Affairs, No. 6454, of the 4th October, 1932); (5) The Draft Agreement regarding the Movements of the Inhabitants of the Frontier Zone, approved by the Council of Ministers on the 5th June, 1932 (see letter of secretary of the Council of Ministers of the 13th June, 1932, and sent to Iranian Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Tehran Legation letter No. 1107 of the 24th August, 1932); (c) The Temporary Agreement for the Appointment of Frontier Com missioners concluded on the 2nd December, 1932, as subsequently amended; and also (d) Article 5 of the Iraqi Draft Treaty of Residence and Neighbourly Relations, approved by the Council of Ministers on the 6th December, 1931 (see Council of Ministers’ letter No. 1108 of the 23rd March, 1932), expanded so as specifically to provide for safe guarding Iraqi rights in frontier streams. 2. The points which should be specifically mentioned in any statement of the general heads of agreement are— (a) Nomadic tribesmen and villagers accustomed to take or send their flocks across the boundary at certain seasons of the year shall be allowed to cross and travel without hindrance to their traditional pastures; they shall be exempt fy om the passport and residence laws of the two countries; no customs duties shall be charged on their tents, household equipment, animals, &amp;c., nor on any supplies taken for their own consumption; commodities forming the object of commeicia transactions only shall become liable to pay duty. (b) The tax, including koda and grazing fee, on sheep, goats, cattle and camels of such persons shall not exceed a specified rate per head according to t e length of stay, e.q., half the koda rates laid down by the Iraqi Koda Law tor a stay of less than four months. No tax shall be collected on horses, mules an donkeys The method of collection whereby the Government to which they are subject may collect the tax and pay it as a lump sum to the other Government is to be preferred. . n ip ^ -ui (c) The two Governments agree m principle that the fewest possible restrictions shall be placed on villagers and tribesmen resident near the boun. within a zone of 8 kilom., on each side, who have occasion to cross m the course ot their normal vocations. , , . . ^ ^ i , (d) Frontier commissioners in suitable numbers to be appointed throughout the length of the boundary, to co-operate in preserving security and settling disputes between persons living on different sides of the boundary.6 ( 1 ) ( 2 ) M A Permanent Frontier Commission of High Degree shall be constituted the Permanent Commission will be as toliows . If the Frontier Commissioners of the two sides, in the course of the execution of their duties, find that they cannot agree as to the precise position of the boundary as laid down m the relevant treaties and agreements between the two Governments, the Peimanent Commission accompanied by the necessary survey experts shall on the demand of either party, proceed to the spot, indicate the true line to the Frontier Commissioners and, if necessary, erect supplementary marks to prevent renewed misunderstanding. . r . In the event of a dispute regarding the use of the waters of any streams that themselves form the boundary or cross the boundary trom one country into the other the commission shall, on the demand of either party “ proceed to the spot accompanied by the necessary technical experts and, unless there already exist an arrangement between the two sides, shall enquire into the ancient customary division of the water and, on the basis thereof, fix the proportions in which the inhabitants of the two sides shall enjoy the use of the water; they shall also define the manner in which their decision shall be executed. If the commissioners are unable to agree regarding the settle ment of any case submitted to them they shall choose a neutral arbi trator to decide the matter; if they cannot agree on the neutral arbitrator, the President of the Council of the League of Nations shall, if one of the two Governments wish, be invited to appoint him. The commission may deal with any other matter submitted to it by agreement between the two Governments. (3) [Appendix D not printed.'] Appendix E. (Secret.) Persian Boundary : Memorandum No. 5.

(There is, at the moment of writing, no information as to whether the Gasba Statistics are sent to us, but I assume not.) 3. As regards ocean-going steamers vessels discharging or loading at Mohammerah are presumably in Persian waters and no Iraqi customs supervision takes place. There is also no Iraqi customs supervision of shiploading and discharging at Abadan. When vessels are loading at Hartha (between Mohammerah and Abadan, downstream of the bar) there is a Persian customs official on board if Persian goods are being loaded, and an Iraqi customs official on board if Iraqi goods are being loaded. But there is no official agree ment on this subject. 4. As regards the prevention of cross-river smuggling, there is no co-operation. The Persians certainly have armed launches on the river, and we have on many occasions had to complain of their interference with river craft. (B)— Policy. 5. I suggest that the policy of the Iraqi delegation should be to seek to reach an agreement (preferably in the form of a letter from the Iraqi represen tative describing the arrangements offered and a letter from the Persian representative accepting the proposals) which shall confirm the arrangement of 1924 for country craft (paragraph 2 above) and define the existing procedure for ocean-going steamers (paragraph 3 above). 6. To provide against unilateral Persian action in interfering with other river craft it would seem wise to aim at creating a joint preventive service to patrol the river and prevent smuggling from bank to bank. If possible the commandant of this joint service should be Iraqi (to mark Iraqi sovereignty) with a Persian assistant commandant. The ratings might be recruited in equal numbers from the nationals of the two parties. It would probably be convenient to place this service under the Conservancy Board. It would probably be necessary to provide that Persians accused of smuggling should be handed over to the Persian courts, Iraqis and foreigners to the Iraqi courts, or alternatively that all accused persons should be handed over to the Persian authorities if the craft being used is registered in Persia, otherwise to the Iraqi authorities. Appendix E. (Secret.) Persian Boundary : Memorandum No 6. Quarantine. Although Iraq adhered to the International Sanitary Convention of 1^26 in 1931 (see Law No. 28 of 1931), no domestic legislation has been passed to authorise the Government to implement its obligations. Strictly speaking, the legal authority for what quarantine work is done by the Port of Basra is one of the old G.O.C/s proclamations of the occupation. Nevertheless, the port medical authorities actually work in accordance with the convention. 2. Ships entering the Shatt-el-Arab are not subjected to quarantine inspection at Fao, but at the ports in the river. Ihe Iraqi authorities, therefore, only pass ships in and out of Basra itself at Sarraji. ii n p .&lt;? 3. Until about 1927 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, acting on behalf of the Port of Basra, undertook on payment certain of the port services at Abadan harbour, including inspecting and passing ships in and out of Abadan, an isolating and treating any infectious cases found on such ships. About 19 , without any agreement or arrangement with the Basra port authority, a Persian Government doctor replaced the Oil Company s doctor. . . 4. The present position, therefore, is that the Persian medical authorities are granting pratique and issuing bills of health to ships arriving at or eavmg Abadan. But the Port of Basra Authority is for international purposesfor the granting of piatique already made the necessary arrangements, bills of health. The port authority has already ma^de w V itll0ut S p ers i an and it would be possiWe o -^l-h^h^ne^ ;a ^ ^ jun co-operation. The ob,ec s Smething new and therefore contrary to the Tpfrd of the mutual u/dertakings given at Geneva not to do anything that might render ignore The 'sanitary situation on shore, and Persian narticipation ”n the arrangements would doubtless contribute to efficiency. Under article 9 of 0 the Sanitary Convention, however, Persia would be expected to exchange all necessary information, even though not participating in the organisation. ^ ion seems t0 me to be relatively unimportant in the particular connexion of the boundary dispute. It is therefore unnecessary to take a decision at this stage on the policy to be pursued. It will depend on the decisions taken on the other questions. Appendix G. (Secret.) Persian Boundary : Memorandum No 7. Police on the Shatt-el-Arah. (A)— Present Position. There is no arrangement for co-operation on the Shatt-el-Arab. (On the contrary, there is a good deal of obstruction, chiefly in connexion with passports.) 2. All ocean-going ships in the Shatt-el-Arab, whether lying out in the stream or moved alongside the wharf at Abadan, are under the authority of the port. In the case of trouble the Port Director calls in the Iraqi police from Siba. 3. Persian police, as far as is known, do not go on board such ships for any official purpose. 4. There is, therefore, no reason to raise the police question at any early stage of the negotiation as far as ocean-going steamers are concerned. 5. Persian police no doubt interfere with small craft on the river. It may be assumed that such interference generally has the prevention of smuggling as its motive. The solution of this matter can therefore be most suitably sought in connexion with the proposals for a joint customs preventive service. [Appendices H, J, K, L, M, N, 0 and P not printed.] Appendix Q. Translation of a Letter from Nuri Pasha to Mr. Kazemi, August 22, 1935. My dear Minister, on thl n rPm S ip r «?n 0 f rt fR t0 T he C ^ uncil of the League of Nations of the 25th May, 193£ T ^ e rac l 1 Government, relating to the boundary between Iraq an direct oonvpr^Hon ^ ^commended that our two Governments should, throug m the w^ofa ^ rem ° Val ° f ^ diffiCUltieS StandinFollowing this recommendation, in view of the repeated statements of the Iranian Government that it would still have preferred to settle the dispute by direct negotiation, and in order to mark the sincere desire of Iraq to reach a solution, I decided to offer, if conditions were favourable, to lead a delegation myself to Tehran, rather than to invite an Iranian delegation to visit Bagdad, a course which might have been considered the more normal and appropriate to the circumstances. Verbal communications made to the Iraqi Legation to the effect that the Iranian Government no longer desired to press the Iraqi Government to agree to a change of boundary, but would be content with practical benefits and advantages on the Shatt-el-Arab, appeared to have created the necessary favourable conditions; and on the 5th August I reached Tehran. Following our preliminary conversations, I was disappointed to receive from your Excellency, on the morning of the 11th August, a draft Treaty of Friendship and annexures, which were unacceptable for the principal reasons that— (1) Article 3 provided for a redefinition of the land boundary only, as delimited in 1914, and omitted mention of the section of the boundary from the mouth of the Nehr-el-Kaiin to the sea; (2) Article 5 attempted to define conditions on the Shatt-el-Arab in such a manner as to leave the question of sovereignty entirely vague; and (3) Annexure No. 2, a draft agreement for the administrative conti ol of the Shatt-el-Arab, was so worded as clearly to imply a change in the boundary from the left bank to the thalweg, or, rather, the median line. In our ensuing conversations I had the honoui to point out that the diafts were inconsistent, not only with the above-mentioned messages sent through the Legation, but also with the repeated assurances given by your Excellency, m the course of our preliminary conversations, that the Iranian Government was not asking for a change in the boundary on the Shatt-el-Arab. . , , I then handed to you on the evening of the 13th August, m the form of a draft statement of Heads of Agreement, detailed proposals for a series of treaties or agreements providing for a complete redefinition of the boundary as de inn e in 1914 and covering the whole range of problems connected with the boundary; the draft thus constituted the basis of a settlement of the legal question linked up with a solution of all the practical questions of special interest to one oi other of our Governments, on the lines recommended by the rapporteur. Your Excellency informed me that, subject to the omission of specific references to earlier treaties and agreements, the validity of which the Iranian Governme^ had contested, you were prepared to accept this draft as the basis of negotiations On the 19th August his Excellency the Prime Minister informed me that he would be prepared to agree to a redefinition of the whole frontier as delimited in 1914 from the point of contact with Turkey to the sea, without change, subjec to the giving of adequate guarantees that the rights and practical bene s which Iraq was prepared to recognise or concede to ^an m the SbatLe - ^ should be secure in perpetuity and not be liable to be icvo y ^ e fc act of the Iraqi Government.

NURI SAID. } Appendix R. Letter from Mr. Kazemi to Nuri Pasha, received at noon on August 25, 1935. (Translation.) My dear Minister, I have received your esteemed letter of the 22nd August, 1935. In the first place permit me to remove the complete misunderstandings that have occurred, and then to give certain explanations. Firstly .—With regard to what you have said concerning your own coming to Tehran, namely, that given suitable conditions you were ready to come to Tehran although it would have been more suitable for the discussions to take place in Bagdad, I would remind you that your coming to Tehran was in accordance with the desire expressed by yourself through the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, and that that too was accompanied by the acceptance of the condition that the protocol of 1914 should not be mentioned. I on my side, since I was confident of the friendly feelings and cordial views of my own Government, immediately welcomed the proposal and expressed my pleasure at the realisation of this intention and the conduct of direct negotiations between the two States, a procedure which the Imperial Government had always had in mind. Secondly. —You state that a verbal intimation had been made to the Iraqi Legation to the effect that the Persian Government did not desire to press the Iraqi Government to alter the boundary, but would be content with practical benefits in the Shatt. The fact is that I repeatedly informed your Excellency that, if anybody had said anything to the Iraqi Legation, it must have been that the Persian Government was not pressing to make an alteration in the land part of the boundary; but that if anything was said it must have been the personal view of the speaker and that he had no authority to say any such thing. Thirdly. At the end of the third paragraph you say that I gave your Excellency repeated assurances that Persia does not desire a change in the oundary on the Shatt-el-Arab. I am obliged to state categorically that I never said any such thing to your Excellency. On the contrary I have always emphasised and explained the legal and equitable rights of my Government in the Shatt-el- ao an e necessity of observing the universally accepted international rules, in S fi a ement / , ma de was that, if the objects of the Persian Government in the pretnrirnd^LTof SS y G ° Vernment W ° Uld ^ t0 y° ur that, subject to the treaty, nevertheless, since the obtaining of a vroc'es-verbal nf J&gt;’ f you ^ Exce Uency insisted that the form shoulf not insistthaf'the settled 7^™^ was preferable, I agree Pat it stuld ^ wrltterfn tWn f ° rm ° f a ^‘/but I might letters.

Consequently, if your Excellency imagined that his Excellency the Prime Minister considered the formation of a commission would take the place of the frontier question in the Shatt-el-Arab sector, there has been a misunderstanding. When it appeared that your Excellency had construed the matter in this way, both his Excellency and I informed your Excellency of the truth of the matter on the evening of the 28th Murdad, 1314:, in order that there should be no misconception. The Imperial Government regrets that the negotiations conducted in Tehran will not have led promptly to a result. The Royal Iraqi Government has persisted in its views and has in no way taken the difficulties of the Imperial Government into account. Directly or indirectly they have pressed the Imperial Government to accept the validity of the boundary delimited in 1914 and the provisions of the Treaty of Erzerum, whereas, for numerous reasons and proofs, which have constantly been repeated to the authorities of the Iraqi Government and were explained in the replies of the representatives of Persia at the League of Nations, it is impossible for the Imperial Government to recognise the official nature of the boundary of 1914. Since the Persian Government is desirous with the best of goodwill to settle the difference directly with its neighbouring friendly Government, and in order to dispose of the difficulties which the Iraqi Government declares to be facing her, and in order to demonstrate practically and concretely its inward inclination for peace and agreement with its dear and respected neighbour, it is ready to consider formulae which shall not be incompatible with the special situation of Iraq, which its representatives have frequently explained and which shall at the same time correspond with the prestige and honour of Persia, with right, justice and equity. It was for these reasons that the Persian Government was prepared to abandon parts of its rightful claims and to recede from some of its expectations. Elis Excellency the Prime Minister and I, taking into consideration the objection of the Iraqi Government, evolved several formulae and proposed them to your Excellency. Unfortunately, your Excellency did not accept any one of these formulae; you repeated your former claims and pressed for recognition of the whole 1914 line, without giving any facility in the important matter contemplated by the Persian Government. You will therefore agree that the Imperial authorities have left no step untaken in order to obtain the result and object, and have demonstrated their goodwill in the best way. We still hope that the Royal Iraqi Government will take the position of the Imperial Government fully into account and either accept any one of the formulae which have been proposed in Tehran in the last few days, or will endeavour to propose a new formula acceptable to Persia, in order that, please God, success may perhaps be attained in solving the matter. The audience with His Imperial Majesty has been fixed for Sunday, 2nd of the current month of Yurmah, at 5 p.m. at the Palace of Sa’adabad.

He thought it would be difficult to persuade Persian Government to agree to include Bahmanshir though he professed personally to understand technical arguments in favour. Persian Government would view inclusion as yet another concession to Irak to whom they think they are already being very generous. I tried to explain that the Conservancy Board scheme in a practical and technical way deals with river problems, and its efficiency ought not to be hampered by extraneous political coEsuderations. 5. Nouri confirmed the 1st paragraph of my telegram No.357 and I believe he will have clear instructions that first stage in negotiations must be Conservancy Board Convention with British participation. 4. As regards Treaty details he seemed most anxious for Persia in return for agreeing to 1914 frontier with adjustment at Abadan to be allowed jurisdiction over shipping off the port of Abadan and any other ports which may one day be constructed. I suggested that if Persia, obtained frontage at Abadan juxisGic- tion question-there would be automatically solved but I could not see how Iraq could agree to the other purely hypo the micax ^u jec Nouri was rather obstinate about this formula for which J &amp; w'x he has obtained approval of the Council o^ Ministers. i.*- , that if he came back with nothing to show even his ^t lueua. would accuse him of being pro-British.

Samii appeared ill informed and asked Nuri for details of negotiations in Tehran and Geneva. Nuri supplied these and explained present position. He suggested that con servancy board convention should be first item on agenda of forthcoming negotiations in Bagdad; to be following (if agreement were reached) by treaties of friendship and bon voisinage, which should present no serious difficulty once Shatt-el-Arab question was settled. He had expressed opinion that there was no hope of any progress unless Persian delegation had clear instructions concerning agenda to be followed and necessity of participation of His Majesty’s Government in negotiations for conservancy board convention on which point Iraqi Government were quite decided. He urged Samii if necessary to go to Tehran himself and get these instructions from the Shah. Addressed to Foreign Office; repeated to Tehran No. 76.(?0f) Co) question at two atove is settled.

In the circumstances we can hardly be held to blame for the present unsatisfactory aud neoulous scudx of affairs.

This i*?# of course# rather at variance with what H^ri and Edmond.e said to me here in the autumn, wince they then both agreed that there seemed little or no hope of making any progress with the Treaty of Friendship, and that it would be far better now to try to get the practical question of the Conservancy Bo rd settled first, end deal with the Treaty of Friendship and the question of the frontier afterwards. But whether this; is so or not, what you my about the Conservancy Board Convention being merely an annexur# to the Treaty of Friendship 1© quite new to me. The latest of the many drafts of the Treaty of Friendship which have been produced had only one annexurt, via. the definition of the frontier* But it did provide in one of lt«s articles for the subsequent negotiation of a number of subsidiary, but &amp;epur&amp;te, instruments, of which the Conservancy Board Convention was to be one. %-e were rather surprised at the time at the proposal that the Treaty of Friendship might come into fores in advance of such essential subsidiary instrument® as the Conservancy Convention and the proposed Oil Royalties Agreement? but, even if the original proposal had been stuck to that ail these Instruments should come into force simultaneously, we never imagined that it was seriously contemplated that the Conservancy Board Convention, which we regard as an instrument in which Hia Majesty’s Government are vitally interested, should ever be relegated to the position of a mere ©nnexure to a bilateral Parso-Traqi Treaty. Had we regarded this suggestion as serious we should certainly h..ve protested very strongly at the time. 4. But ev^n mo the fact that the proposed conaorvancy con vention soy be subsidiary to the Treaty of Friendship would not /inin the l#a©t mmn that it neerl he conelude^l het'^eem the same pi^rtie©* The tMnmrm^ Pea at ettlem^nt with Tarhey for example oomsists of a large namher of separate tnetramenta# many of whioh are organically interconneeted, hut were concluded he tween different nt rtiea* I thlnlc f am. right in keying that there have hem many international instruments to which other instruments between different parties h&amp;re hem attached In one way or another. In any ce ne any mechanical difficulty of this kind which may arise i® entirely subordinate to the main political consideration that His Majesty’s Government attach the highest political importance to being themselves a party to the conservancy convention# a® both the Iraqi and the Persian Governments have been repeatedly told* 5 . Ae regards your third point, our complaint is that the Iraqi Government have apparently agreed with the Persian Government# without consulting us# to enter into nogati^tions with the Persian Government about a convention to which they know that His Majesty’s Government wish to be a party. It would have been quite easy for the Iraqi Government, if they wished to bring: pressure to bes&amp;r on the Persian Government, to say that they would not aieeuse or attempt to negotiate the Conservancy Convention until an agreement had been reached as to who were to be the parties to It. T cannot agree therefore that the Persian Government 'hold the key to the situation* 6 . T am afraid X cannot agree either thet we have no ^loeus standi except by the good will of both parties. ' It ** quite true thr.t if the Iraqi and Persian Governments wished to adopt an unfriendly attitude towards us, they could reach a bilateral agreement about the Gonoervancy Convention behind, . But I think there is no doubt that we should regard / thi ss. our backs,37 this# in view at ih« consider^:-tlon-fe met out below, a definitely unfriendly set on the pfirt of the Iraqi Oovernment, ma in vl^w of their acceptance of the principal of our pa rticipation, l think we are entitled, to ejrpeot them to take &amp; more satisfactory line* 7* It is not quite accurate to say that we b&amp;ve no locus stand for claiming to participate in the uomweatlon. ! ''&gt;ne of the principal subjects of the pro paced convention wilt be the shipping in the Shatt* which is over 90^ British. It it therefore a British interest which will be mainly affected - favourably or unfavourably - by the convention, and the existence of this British Interest, dot© give us a very strong moral claim to participate* 'gain the frapt dovemment have always recognised that the arrangementa made for the future of the Chatt-el- rab may have a vital strategic importance, and, In view of our obligations toward# Iraq under the \nglo~ Iraqi Treaty of /Ia lance It Is quite clear thst we have a very strong claim indeed to be consulted about and to participate In th o re a rraagament s. 8.

No•269• Following for Mr. Render;- My telegram No.266. Nuri Pasha today confirmed my appreciation of present situation. He does not feel forthcoming negotiations will lead anywhere and is prepared for further disappointment. His information is that Kazemi is deliberately aiming at failure so as to break Samii who is said to be in London at present and may refuse to head Persian delegation in Bagdad until auguries are more favourable. Nuri Pasha added that negotiations for treaty of friendship at Geneva ended in deadlock owing to insistence of Iraqi Government on British participation on equal basis in conservancy board and negotiations for convention. He endeavoured to sweeten the Persians who blamed His Majesty’s Government for impasse by deferring to their wishes in regard to near eastern non-aggression pact. When negotiations sire resumed in Bagdad Iraqi delegation will take line that if Persians really want treaty of friendship they will only get it by agreeing to British .participation in discussion of conservancy board convention which Nuri wants to be dealt with separately and apart from treaty of friendship. In his view this treaty touches frontier questions too intimately ro allow of conservancy board convention being safely considered m connexion, with it. . , . , Addressed to Foreign Office No*269 Ndvemoer 20mi, repeated to Tehran No.73,1935 J ■II IMI —T NO DI 3 TRIEUTION Cypher telegram to Sir A. Clark Kerr, (Bagdad), Foreign Office, 25th November, 1955, 5.00 p.m. No.268. -o -o -o ~o ~o ~o -o ~o “ Your telegram No.269 (of November 20th - Shatt-el~Arab Conservancy Board Convention). Nuri Pasha’s statement in. final paragraph suggests that situation may not be so unsatisfactory as appeared, though it hardly tallies with earlier suggestion that Conservancy Convention was to be main object of impending negotiations. Provided Iraqi Government are determined not to proceed with discussion of Conservancy Board Convention unless Persian Government agree to British participation in its negotiation and conclusion, basis of our position is secure. On the other hand it seems futile at this stage to reopen negotiations oh Treaty of friendship and frontier question so long as no prior agreement in regard to Conservancy Convention has been reached. 2. But while His Majesty's Government do not ask more of Iraqi Government, they d© not expect less. I consider Iraqi Government are right, as power in possession of ohatt-el Arab, to offer Conservancy Convention to Persian Government, not only because establishment of Board, i.e. of unified control over //hole Shatt system, including Persian waters, is becoming increasingly necessary to Iraq if Shatt is to remain open at all, but al^o means of relegating purely juridical aspect of-frontier dispute to background. It is equally in Iraq’s interest that Convention should be tripartite, with Iraq’s ally as third signatoiy. His Majesty’s Government have strong claim, both on strategic grounds as Iraq’s ally and as owners of over 90f of shipping lively to he affected, to he consulted from the outset and to participate m negotiationnegotiation and conclusion of any new arrangement regarding the ohatt. g. Position of Persian Government is different. They are not power in possession of river and not our ally, and. if they do not like Convention which Iraqi Government offer them they are free to reject it and let dispute take its course before League. I cannot agree therefore that Persian Government hold key to position as regards our participation or that so far as Iraqi Government are concerned His majesty’s Government have no locus standi for demanding participation. 4. Point 2 in your telegram No.266 (of November 19th) appears technical difficulty. Puri Pasha and hr. Ldmonds indicated that Iraqis had definitely rejected Article 6 of Treaty of Friendship as drafted by Persian delegation at Geneva (see my despatch No.697 (of October loth)) and this is confirmed by Nuri’s statement in final paragraph of your telegram No.269 (of November 20th).

Nuri Pasha, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, jailed on me this evening on a flying visit from Geneva whence he had arrived this afternoon. He is leaving tomorrow norning for Bagdad. He was accompanied hy Ali Jawdat Bey, who was Iraqi Prime Minister last winter and is now Iraqi Minister designate in London hut has not yet received his letters of credence. Mr* Baggallay was also present at our discussion. 2. After summarising the history of Perso-Iraq relations during the last few months, as it is already Known to us, and giving a lively account of his conversation with the Shah, at which His Imperial Majesty had made it clear (I gathered in spite of Kazemi) that he would he satisfied with an anchorage opposite Ahadan, not necessarily extending right up to Mohammerah; Nuri gave me an account of the position now reached at Geneva. His English is somewhat halting and peculiar and he was not always easy to follow, hut I understood the position to he as follows:- 3. Nuri and Kazemi had practically agreed on three in struments. The first of these was to he a Three Power Pact of non-aggression to which Turkey (whom he described as being very keen on it) was to he a party. The difficulty had been to make this Pact tally with the Irag Government's obligations to His Majesty's Government under the Treaty of Alliance and to the League under the Covenant, as well as with Irag's obligations under the Kellogg Pact. Mr- Pachin had, however, given the Iragi Delegation invaluable advice, and they had els had much very useful unofficial advice from Sir W. Malkin. They had thus been able to devise a text which could lead to no difficulty. The only outstanding point wae the questThere was an obscurity the proposed definition of aggression, to he cleared up here, hut Nuri Pasha hoped that it might he disposed of in time for the Pact to he initialled ad referendum to the three Governments, tomorrow, October 1st. The Pact was to consist of six articles. A small complication had arisen over a proposal emanating from either the Persians or the Afghans that Afghanistan should have the option of becom ing a party to it. But Nuri had resisted this, as he felt that Iraq was too remote from Afghanistan to enter into any commitments with Afghanistan at this stage. It was not clear, however, whether he might not write a letter on this point which might still leave the door open for Afghanistan to come in at a later stage. 4. The second instrument was a treaty (consisting of 22 articles) for the peaceful settlement of international disputes between Persia and Iraq. Nuri was, generally speak ing, quite happy about this, as it was closely based on •=■ model treaty which had been devised by a League Committee, of which Sir W.Malkin had been a member, in 1928. The only point in doubt here arises out of Article 20 which referred to the rights of third parties. Nuri hoped that this point might be cleared up in time to allow the Treaty to be initialled tomorrow, October 1st, but he seemed a little doubtful. 5. The third instrument was far more important and was the much discussed perso-Iraqi Treaty of Friendship. Th.re have been a great number of texts of this Treaty and Mr. Sterndale-Bennett told me this morning over the telep that they had superseded each otherwith such rapidity that not even he could find his way about them. I understand .-.-i -y .q hp'pe on October 2nd, will be that Mr. Bdmonas, who will be neie o able/able to give is a clear account of the present position. $uri Pasha explained that the Persians had at first wished to include a provision in this (Treaty to the effect that both parties would possess 'equal rights' in the Shatt-el- Arab. It was not (juite clear whether these were to be provided for in terms, or whether the (Treaty was to contain a provision for the subsequent negotiation of an agreement to give equal rights to both parties. In any case Uuri Pasha had refused to agree to any provision in the (Treaty of l^iendship dealing with the substance of the proposed Conservancy Board Convention. He had now proposed that the (Treaty should contain a list of instruments to be subsequently negotiated, among which mention should De made without specifying its provisions - of a tripartite Conservancy Board Convention for the Shatt-el-Arab. He said that the Iraqi Grovernment had now definitely agreed that His Majesty s Government must be a party to the Convention and that he did not anticipate any serious difficulty from the Persians, though they were still anxious to avoid the mention of His Majesty s Government by name. 6. It would also fee provided in this Treaty of ifiendship that the frontier should be redefined in an Annex, ana it might be possible to leave the precise definition in bhis Annex over for subsequent negotiations. Exe new line would, however, give the Persians an anchorage opposite Abadan and the only question at issue was exactly how wide that anchorage would be. 7. Nuri Pasha seemed to thint that it might be possible to arrange for this Treaty also to be initialled - like the other two, ad referendum to the Governments concerned. He explained that if these three instruments could be initialled at Geneva before Kazemi left it w^uld b y(\ iV the powers of the proposed Board over the Karun, etc. 10. I emphasised to Kuri the great mutual interest Yfhioh hoth Iraq and Persia had in securing close co-operation in the control of the Shatt. I repeated the well-known arguments about the precarious condition of the Shatt and the urgent necessity for controlling and regulating tne flow oa the waters of the Karun. This could only be done with Persian co-operation. The position was in fact that if the Iraqis did not secure Persian co-operation they might well lose the use of the Shatt altogether, while if the Persians refusea to co-operate with the Iraqis, they would probably lose the use of both MO hammer ah and Abadan. ' The question was not really a political one at all, but one of practical common sense for settlement by technical methods. This was a further reason for British participation, as tne two parties be sure that the British representatives on the Board would work whole-heartedly for the proper maintenance and management of the waterway. In any case, as both parties were aware, His Majesty's Government had the best of reasons for claiming an equal share in the management of this waterway, seeing the shipping which would be controlled by that practically all tne snrppj-^o the Board was British. 11. Huri Pasha professed to realise al-t this -nd took ai « he had «. »«♦ »«•* » 0 ;'“ r ” a the importance of getting on witn tne negotiation ^ ^ ^ Oonservancy Board Convention and putting the politica q , . fortunately the Shah's latest attitude in the background. iiortu.ai- - and Nuri was very hopeful that had rendered this much easier and , . ^ the pronosed Conservancy negotiations for the conclusion of tne pro^ . 14 _ _ later than November.

The discussions centred round a draft treaty of friendship, one article of ¥/hich was intended to redefine and finally establish, with the help of appendices, the line of the frontier both on land and in the Shatt-cl-Arao. A copy of the draft as it stood at the time when the Xragi and Persian Ministers for Foreign Affairs left Geneva at the end of Sepcember is enclosed herein. This draft was not signed or even initialled, but it will be seen that the words 'agreed' or 'not agreed' appear against each article. These are confidential notes made by Mr. C.J. Edmonds, and may be taken as inaieating the degree of progress made as a result of the discussions, m this connexion it should be noted that the word 'agreed' against Article 4, i.e. the article dealing with the frontier, is of little significance since no agreement was/ Jnder-Secretary of State, India Office* ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY LETTcn J MO. 4 2 170CTB35 FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL AND StORET DEPT- iNO'A Qf f&amp;t ttll i scct ms INDI A OFFICE q-QPY Sfc.N l t U.was reached regarding the actual definition of the frontier in the annex to he attached to this article. 3. Article Ho. 4,and Article No. 6 which deals with the proposed Shatt-el-Arah Conservancy Board, are the m ost important features in the treaty and are to some extent dependent on each other, since the acceptance hy Persia of the present frontier (suDject to the proposed rectification at Abadan) is naturally hound up with her participation m the Conservancy Board. The position with regard to the fronti,..r is that at the beginning of the discussions Nuri Pasha communicated to Monsieur Kasemi a draft of an annex describing the frontier to he attached to the treaty. A copy of this annex is enclosed. It will he seen that this text descrihes the frontier as following the 1914 line except for a rectification at Abadan, the extent of which is left for future definition. Monsieur Kazemi does not seem to have raised any specific objection to this text, or definitely ro have rejected it; hut neither did he expressly accept it, , unwilling to commit himself in regard perhaps because he was to'the frontier unless Nuri Pasha agreed to the inclusion in the treaty of an article summarising the Conservancy Board Convention. It is relevant to note that, although the Shah appears to have informed Nuri Pasha orally in Tehran that he did not press that the new Abadan anchorage should he * ■ c with the old Persian anchorage at Mohammerah, and coterminous with ^hu uuu r although it is possible that the Irakis might be ready to accept the latest Persian proposal that the new Abadan should he at least four miles long, the Iragis 4 - Vi .Q pH V 6 S / anchorageT ! r l fi * fk* : IVh themselves have not yet decided on the limits of width bo which they should attempt to restrict the anchorage, while the Persians are still pressing that it should expend to the thalweg, so that no agreement on the vital question of its width is yet in sight* 4. On the. other hand Nuri Pasha was unable, for obvious reasons, to agree to the present xorm of article 6, which would give Persia all she desires in the matter of the Conservancy Board-i.e.-equal rights in the control of the Shatt-el-Aralo - without giving the proposed Board any authority over the Karun or the Bahmanshir, or offering any guarantee that the other equally essential requirements of Iraq in connexion with the Board would he met. Hurl Pasha was in fact unwilling to include in the treaty any summary of the Convention at all. since he rightly feared that a y such anticipation of its provisions would only v/ea.con the Iraqi position in the eventual negotiations for the Convention itself, hut he offered, as a w^ out of the difficulty, to include a 'Tripartite Conservancy Board •t -i r-irmexits the eventual negotiation ,, Gonvention ,, among ohe instruments 'of which is provided for in Article V. It was, ho^'ov, pointed out to the Iraqi delegation at Geneva hy members of the United Kingdom delegation that article 7 in its present form scarcely corresponded to what had hibherto understood to he the wishes of the Iraqi Government, inasmuch as the proposal had hitherto been that the various instruments (and especially the Bon Voisinage agreement (Ho. 6) and the oil royalties convention (Ho. 9)) should come into forcesimultaneously, while under the article these instruments would come into force not only subsequently to the treaty of friendship itself (by which Persia would obtain the Abadan anchorage) but independently of each other. 5. It was also pointed out to the Iraqi delegation that Article 3, providing for qualified most-favoured-nation treatment, was not entirely suitable for inclusion in a treaty of friendship, especially as this treaty was intended to be permanent: it would probably be more appropriate for this matter to be dealt with in an Establishment Convention, such as that mentioned as No. 3 of Article 7. 6. It now seems possible that the procedure contemplated at G-eneva may be reversed and that Nuri Pasha may try to arrange for the negotiation of the proposed Tripartite Conservancy Board Convention at Bagdad, or possibly at Basra, in anticipation of the conclusion of a treaty of friendship. Such a procedure would present obvious advantages, since, once agreement has been reached on the complicated and important matters covered by the proposed Conservancy Board Convention, many of the difficulties which have beset the negotiation of the more general instruments are likely to lose their practical importance. At any rate Nuri Pasha and Monsieur Kazemi seem to have agreed before parting that detailed negotiations (a) for a Conservancy Board Convention and (b) regarding the limits of the Abadan anchorage, should take place in Novemoex? when Monsieur Kazemi returns from- his projected visit to Soviet Russia, Afghanistan and India. The Iraqi G-cvernment have undertaken to insist on the Conservancy Board Convention Dej..ng a Tripartite one between Iraq., Persia and the United Kingaum. They have made it clear that they will accept trie participationc - v ' vr o\ of a United Kingdom negotiator in the negotiations; and although the Bagdad cabinet appear to he divided on this ooint and the Iraqis have put forward proposals in many points differing materially from the 1932 draft, there is reason to hope that they will eventually accept the 1932 draft of the Convention, at least as a basis for discussion, fhe Persian Government on the other hand, while no longer openly opposing British participation, have given no clear undertaking that they will either agree to it, or uo the 1932 draft serving as a basis. Moreover there is still a wide gap to be bridged between the Persian and Iraqi views in regard to the width of the proposed new Persian anchorage at Ab adan. 7.

September, 6 Sir, I m coMn&amp;ui ec ty My Lor«is GoamiRelcmere of the Admiralty to refer to Adalmlty letter M.0472/10/35 of the 24th July 1935, on the abject of the frontier between Iraq ana Persia in the if hatt-el- \rafa. In paragraph 4 of thie letter a suggestion was made that, subject to Colonel War vlewe, a strip of water off Abadan within certain definite limits could safely be granted to Persia in return for aie acceptance of the Conservancy B card Convention. Their Lordships have now had the advantage of personal consultation with Colonel Ward, who is at present on leave in this country. He states that the Persian ban* just above Abadan is revetted, whereas the Iraqi bank is not, and that owing to the extension of the shoal on she Iraqi side, the channel in this part of the river ie tending to becoae narrower. In Colonel Vard'fi view any strip granted to Persia should not go further up river than iiuaber 1 Jetey, or, at the wry utmost, Murgaba Jetty. In the light of the Information um laid before them. Their Lordships fully endorse this view, and I am, therefore, to request that the northern limit of the strip mentioned in the Admiralty letter under reference choul.. be amended accordingly. Their Lordships also understand that Colonel ard hones that it may be .possible to secure Persian acceptance tf a strip less then 100 yards in width. In this connection I am to emphasise that the limits mentioned both as regards length and width in the Admiralty letter of the 24th July were indicated to be a maximum, and it was always envisaged / that icier Secretary of State, foreign. Office, 1 *1 t]%s.X the negotiators would commence by making a smaller offer. The same comment applies to the revised limits now communicated. Ool on el Ward also referred, to the possibility of a 'naval base* being established off the native village of Abadan, which is teem as rtieikh* s Village. This question was discussed in correspondence ending with Foreign Office letter Ho. S.4B44/SB/S4, elated £8ih August, 1955. He explained that having regard to the strength of the current in the Karun River it was, in his view, more than likely that the Persian If oval authorities would wish to moor the floating dock recently acquired by Persia in the deep water off S-heite f s Village, which Is adjacent to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company*s workshops. Their Lordships share Colonel ^ • arc! 1 s view that such a posit ion would be fraught with danger, not only because of the interference with shipping proceeding up and down the river, but also because of the serious fire risk involved, by placing such a dock in the vicinity of the refinery and loading berths. A raore suitable place for the clock could probably be found in the Persian portion of the river above the confluence of the Karun. In view of this later information My Lords consider that it would be advisable for II.M* Representative at Bagdad to be informed of the practical considerstione advanced by Colonel Ward, and of the consequent necessity of providing a suitable safeguard against the establishment of a floating dock off Sheikh’s Village# if it is decided to grant an anchorage to Persia in this vicinity.

Copy of first draft of such treaty which ITuri proposes to communicate to Persian delegation follows by post accompanied by text of a declaration which might be made on eventual signature. This declaration is to the effect that treaty does not prejudice legal contentions of the two governments raised before the Council in connexion with Iraqi request of November 29th, 1954- that when treaty of friendship comes into force its provisions alone will determine the boundary between the two countries but that otherwise rights of parties in regard to matters discussed before the League remain unchanged and that in par ticular treaty of friendship will not affect water and grazing rights of inhabitants on either side of boundary. resumed between Iraqi and Persian delegations. Conservancy convention appears to be for the moment in the background. Hurl's idea is that if possible the two delegations should agree in Geneva upon text of a short treaty of friendship which v/ould include an article recognising (or if necessary as an alternative2 . &amp; Nuri intends to propose that annexe about Abadan shall be drafted locally at a later stage. his idea is also that subsidiary agreements e 6 g. those regarding bon voisinage 5 oil royalties s and extradition shall be negotiated at Bagdad or Tehran and that a conservancy covenant shall be negotiated at Basra. When Furi consulted United Kingdom delegation regarding terms of proposed treaty of friendship he appeared to be ready to initial such a treaty without linking it in any way with subsidiary agreements. In particular he seemed to attach little importance to a conservancy convention provided frontier questions were settled. Occasion was therefore taken to impress upon him very strongly once more the danger that unless Persian co-operation in conservancy of dhatt-el-hrab v/ere assured the waterway might become un-navigable in which case position of frontier would not matter much. He was urged to link up conservancy convention with treaty of friendship or at least with cession of an anchorage at Abadan and before committing himself to terms of a treaty on lines now contemplated to bind Persians to proceed with negotiation of such convention. There is reason to believe that he will now adopt this course. Nuri also hopes before leaving Geneva to agree upon and initial text of a tripartite treaty of non-aggression between Iraq* Persia and Turkey. He has promised to communicate to United Kingdom delegation draft of such treaty preapred by Persian delegation.

Proposals of XraQi Government mark a distinct aciVfL±cc and I suggest that Mr. Bennett be instructed that our general attitude should be that if they are likely to lead to a settlement which satisfies our fundamental requirements (i.e, a Perso-lraqi-United Kingdom Convention establiohij-j.^ a Navigation aid conservancy Board whose exact functions we could at worst try to adjust later, coupled witn river frontier which will leave Iraqi and British warships free to ascend to Basra in every kind of circumstance) it would be unwise to spoil chances of settlement by raising purely technical objections. 2. Technical objections are nevertheless serious in themselves. For example: (a) One of main objects of Conservancy Board is to render possible conservancy operations in Persian territory and waters. Will Persian Government always be willing to permit such operations unconu.itionally, and if necessary at short notice, if executive control of conservancy work remains with Iraqi Government alone? (b)object without any express provision on lines of paragraph in question, and if it were secured cLi-stinction between 'supervision 11 and 'executive functions' would have little importance„ If, therefore, paragraph is likely to prove stumbling-block to either Iraqi or Persian Governments, it may be well to modify or omit it, and I am consulting other departments as to possibility of doing so. 5 t Finally, it would clearly be preferable from point of view of His Majesty's Government that Board should have direct executive control of conseiv.inc.;, fOx seiv_ce&gt;., of Colonel Ward cannot remain available indefinitely and v® do not know whom Iraqi Government will employ when he leave s« 6 0 I urge then that following line be taken with Iraqi delegation: (1) They should be pressed to consider practical dangers inherent in their proposals.

Your tele grams Nos. 214 (of August 50th) and 218 (of Septemter 1st: Perso-Iraqi Frontier). It is difficult to give any indication of policy of His Majesty’s Goverrirent in regard to proposals which are so oh scure . 2 0 Omission of Article 5 (7) and 6 of Baron Aloisi e draft evidently means that there shall he no appeal from supervisory commission to any outside body c But while .. retention of Article 5 (3) suggests that commission will have three or more members, omission of .Article 5 (1) and (2) suggests that it will have Iraqi and Persian rep- re se nt at iv e s only. 3. If commission of three or more members were to have neutral President appointed by the League or some League organisation on the lines proposed by Baron Aloisi this would in effect amount to a form of internationali sation to which 1 have hitherto believed Iraqi Govern ment to be firmly opposed (see also my telegram No. 86 to Rome (of February 6th),)4. Similarly, establishment of two-member commission whose unanimous approval was required for putting into force of any 'projet' of the kind referred to in Articles 2 and 3 would give Persia absolute veto on all these questions. Surely Iraqi Government do not contemplate anything so dangerous. 5. If on the other hand things were so arranged that commission of two could not prevent execution of such 'pro jets' by territorial power except by unanimous decision, this would mean that Persia would have no greater degree of control in river than at present. Any such arrangement would inevitably be regarded by both Persian Government and Council of League as falling far short of offers already made by Iraq for a practical settlement. Iraqi Government must realise that this would render chances of re aching at Geneva a settlement satisfactory to themselves very remote and would increase sympathy for Persia in those quarters which consider that whether Iraq's legal case is watertight or not, present river frontier is unnatural. 6. Iraqi Government should also remember that draft Conservancy Board convention has been worked out in great detail with the co-operation of servants of Iraqi u-overnmenu with a view to promoting Iraqi interests at every point. It has been before Iraqi Government for three years, iexu ha^ also been communicated to Persian Government, who have ax way indicated that in principle they saw no great objection thereto, and its general lines have been explained to rapporteur* *««1 ren-norteur. His Majesty's Government feel that icr x^ad ^ recede from offer of convention on these lines would he e ster, of unwisdom from Iraq's own point of view. Unless Conservancy Board with willing Persian co-operation can te secured there is grave risk that water-way may oecome urmaviga'ole in a few years, 7 „ I advise Nuri Pasha therefore to do utmost oo induce' Iraqi Soverorrnt to adhere to the idea of Cchser- vaucy Board on lines hitherto envleased.

This would deprive Persia Convention of linuteci. aurauiux-.

This would mean that during period in question Persia would accept frontier de facto and that at end of period de .jure position would be exactly what it is today Iraq having lost none of her rights. New arrangements could then be made in light of prevailing circumstances. This solution would have additional advantage of avoid ing necessity of change in frontier at Abadan. 9. As regards Nuri 1 s practical difficulties (your telegram No. 213) (a) is a possibility, but would be so unreasonable that Iraq would be in strong position if negotiations broke down on such a point (this does not mean that Iraq should necessarily stand out for inclu sion of whole of Bahmanshir as opnosed to section originally contemplated), As regards (b) I suggest that possibility that such a claim may be made should not be allowed to influence main lines of Iraqi policy and that claim should in any case be left for consideration till Article 5 of draft convention is discussed during de- taile d ne gotiations. 10. Nuri Pasha will appreciate that Iraq owes a great deal to support of His Majesty’s Government at Geneva. They have, in fact, done everything possible to secure fair play for Iraq and have been able to defeat manoeuvres......manoeuvres wb.ich would have had the contrary effect. Bo far, however, this has 'been possible because Iraq has placed herself in a good position by offering equitable terms to Persia as part of ultimate settle- W*. w meat. Were Iraq not to go back on these offers and so destroy her own case, His Majesty’s Government might no longer be in a position to afford her effective support.

Nuri Masha has asked me to give you the following message, begins: Iraqi Government are increasingly anxious to retain executive machinery of conservancy and navigation in their own hands and to admit Persian participation only in supervisory commission on lines of Aloisi l ’s Rome proposal (articles 1, 5, 4 and 5, paragraphs 5, 4, 5 and 6). Attitude of Iraqi Government is based on strong reasons of principle but also on the following practical reasons:- (A) The probability that Persians would refuse to include Bah- numshiri, or other essentially Persian v/aters or territory in area controlled by (~? grp, ©mtd.) and (B) Difficulty of ensuring that Persians will not claim to 1 U . wf . have executive control for fixed period of p-erso (5-treaty rights; r ends.

It is unlikely that Nuri will visit London before Geneva. Prime Minister seems again to have retreated to position described in my telegrams Nos. 208 and 210. He wonts all executive functions of proposed Conservancy noard to remain as at present in the hands of Colonel hard. he feared that if Persians are given voice in execuoive matters they will do little but obstruct conservancy and financial operations.

In the course of long and frank discussion this morning the Prime Minister told me that my telegram No. 208, paragraph 1, had correctly reported the attitude of Council ol Ministers. He said that Nuri had misled His Majesty f s Ambassador and Persians in allowing it to be understood that Iraqi Government had accepted the principles embodied in proposed conservancy board convention 0 In so doing he had exceeded his instructions as Council of Ministers had refused to define their attitude towards conservancy board until the Persian Government had definitely recognised Iraqi sovereignty in the Shatt-el~Arabo 2. This did not mean that Iraqi Government would not favour tripartite convention when Persians had withdrawn their objections to water frontier but it did mean that at present they were not prepared to accept parts of article 4 , the first part of article 5, article 6 (A and E), articles 7 ? 8 , 9, 11 , 19, 20 and 25 paragraph 1 because these dealt with financial matters having a direct relationship to the question of sovereignty in the Shatt-el-Arab. Here again it is not that the Iraqi Government object to these articles per se but that they will not commit themselves or consent to hand over functions for which they provide to a body on which Persia isis represented unless and until. Persian Government definitely abandon all claims to sovereignty to any part of the Shatt~el~Arabo 3. Prime Minister said that in the circumstances it was too early in the day to discuss terms of the convention in details 4. His idea of the immediate future is that both parties should return to Geneva and report that as a result of direct negotiations the greater part of the whole dispute is on the way to settlement and that non-aggression and bon voisinage agreements are in sight. They should then ask for further three weeks to allow time for further direct discussions on the question* 5. In spite of this cold douche I spoke in the sense . / of paragraph 4 of your telegram No, 162 to Tehran and urged him strongly to reflect upon the wisdom of shifting the stress from a problematical frontier wrangle on to the more hopeful ground oi conservancy board. The Prime Minister retorted that this was putting the cart before the horse and was contrary to the advice hitherto given by His Majesty T s Government, I demurred and said that your only aim was to protect our mutual interests and to indicate the means of a practical settlement in the shortest possible time m ±i. -■ r\ a &lt;-} J. hm Cl no of loir bt that you were definitely Dilat-eral convention.

On the other hand, it seems hopeless to expect hat, except in regard to rights of passage of Persian ar and merchant vessels, Iraq could or would admit that ersia possesses already, and without any question of raqi favour arising, rights which she will in fact only btain when Conservancy Convention and other agreements re concluded^ 6 As for association of His Majesty’s Government dth assurances there can be no question of their furnish- .ng general guarantee of permanence of settlement now inder consideration^ This might mean accepting formal responsibility for Iraqi Government’s actions, which would an undesirable and indeed impossible commitment in any circumstances, particularly in view of fact that after termination of Anglo-Iraqi alliance His Majesty’s Govern- cbnt may hare no means of influencing Iraq* But if Persian*,». „7 ^ 3. 3 ersian Gove mire nt were to ask for assurance that His kijesty’s Governnent would use their good offices in mrticular circumstances, I would he quite prepared to consider such a request 0 7 C It is also obvious that if His Majesty’s Govern- rnt we re third signatory to a tripartite Conservancy Convention they would he in a position to support either 'ersia or Iraq in the event of Convention being ignored r illegally denounced by the other* In this connexion I see no objection urlma facie to His Majesty 1 s Gove mire nt signing a convention of unlimited duration^ If however suggestion in paragraph 4 above is adopted, Persia would ;et rights of navigation and equal participation in con- ■rol of river in perpetuity even if Conservancy Board .greement itself were not made permanent^ 3, As regards other agreements it seems difficult or His Majesty’s Government to be a signatory and I ssume that neither Persia nor Iraq expect or desire this. ut His Majesty’s Government could, if the parties so esired, undertake to assist them in reaching an equitable ettlement when detailed negotiations begin, 9. On the question of tactics I can add little to y telegram No* 161 (of August 22 nd) a Briefly I agree that uri would be well advised to offer a leased anchorage at badan as a final inducement to Persia but if this fails o lead to comprehensive settlement including redefinition e will presumably withdraw offer completely and either B ‘) indicate that dispute must be referred back to Council &gt;r (b) agree to leave river frontier in abeyance on lines -ddicated in paragraphs 5 (e) and 6 in my telegram No c 161, Addressed to Tehran No, 164, repeated to Bagdad 207 u[This Document Is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be Following is text referred to in my telegram No*164« 'The undersigned plenipotentiaries of the Governments of Iran and Iraq duly authorised to this effect having engaged in discussions with the object of settling the differences that have arisen between the two Governments with regard to the frontier between Iran and.

Afoer mature consideration Admiralty have formed definite v that: (a) of anchorage at Abadan would on expiry of iervancy Board Convention enable Persia to place difficul- : m way of international shipping. Danger might be less if ^rage were no wider than 30 yards but likelihood of such an Ox^e Qeing accepoaole to Persia seems remote 0 (b) cession would also deprive Persia of colourable (even gh illogical and legally indefensible) excuse for supplying iirect to British warships in a war in which Great Britain lelligerent and Persia a benevolent or comnBrcially in- sted neutral. (c) although Conservancy Board is of such importance to j - st.i s Governmexit as to justify acceptance of risks •dant upon a cession if Convention can be obtained in no way, cession would not be justified simply to obtain ad recognition of frontier. ~ J ' Considerations underlying (c) are that main interest Majesty's Government is to preserve right of passage for sh warships and transports in all circ’umstances of peace ar * inis r isht is at present secure (subject to Iraqi goodwill!,...(b ; o o c 2* goodwill; x 02 Giioug/i 1914 fronoiei 1 is not ciccopt/Gd by Pensio, Persia’s claim to tnai/vveg frontier has no legal justifica- oion* ProVi.dea therefore that navigability of river is safe guarded by Conservancy Board, His Majesty’s Government can in Admnalt^/ view contoniplate absence of redefinition of frontier with relative equanimity,, 5 0 Admiralty would tnerefoi^e definitely prefer it if Iraqi Government were to accept settlement already offered •-A j-m oiu(, s i.e. Conservancy noard Convention with conspiracy of silence regarding river frontier (or at any rate with an arrangement under which Iraq reserved all her rights in regard to that frontier when withdrawing dispute from League) rather on an oh at they should be striving after settlement wnich would include Convention with cession (or even lease) at Abadan with redefinition of rest of frontier involve themselves in further interminable negotiations and perhaps lose settlement already offered* 4 0 While I am disposed to agree that interests of His Majesty’s Government might be as adequately safeguarded by reservation of rights as by redefinition with cession, I am not satisfied that it would be fair to advise Iraqi Govern ment that this is equally true of their own interests* 5 0 In all circumstances most satisfactory line to take appears to be as follows: (a) You should avoid talcing initiative without prior reference to me in making any proposal to Persian Government regarding anchorage at Abadan except in conveying a message on Nuri’s behalf„/ z 10 3. (b) You should however advise Nuri that if f lease, of anchorage of even more than 30 yards (but not more than 100 yards) appears necessary to secure a settlement which includes a Conservancy Board Convention and redefinition, he would do well to grant it, (c) If Persian Government should then indicate readiness to accept such a settlement on condition that lease were altered to cession, Iraqi Government would probably do well to agree to cession. (d) If, however, offer of anchorage were insufficient to secure redefinition it would not be worth while for Iraqi Government to make this offer simply in order to provide a 'formula” of doubtful value (See paragraph 4 of ny telegram No. 157)« (e) If matters reached stage indicated in (d) Iraqi Government should seriously consider whether it would not be better to concentrate on obtaining practical advan tages of Conservancy Board Convention while leaving ques tion of frontier in suspense (paragraph 5 of my telegram No. 157). 6 . Ihis last solution would be unsatisfactory in that it would merely postpone the day when frontier ques tion had to be settled but if postponement could be made to last for, say, 50 years, its disadvantages might be held to outweigh those of further deadlock at Geneva® From practical point of view Conservancy Board and smuggling and other agreements should cover most (though possibly not all) points to which Persian non-recognition of frontier mi,ght give rise, while from legal point of view position would.ct..4. would le exactly the same when Question next arose as it io jQa&amp;j } pioviced that IraQ reserved all lier ri^its at appropriate moments If Persian Government for their part could De induced to ceclare when reserving their rights (as they would probably wish to do) that they would keep vnO ir claims in suspense during validity of Conservancy Board Convention position would be still more adequately covered.

If Kazemi and Puri are likely to reach a general igreement providing inter alia for negotiation and conclusion cf a ohatt-el-Arab conservancy convention, Puri should be on his piard against accepting any formula which ¥/ould definitely restrict number of Signatories to two. It is equally undesirable cf course that formula should allow of indiscriminate addition )f Signatories. 5. There does not at present appear to be any argument which could be used with Persian Government in support of objections of Ms Majesty’s Government to exclusion from Convention (as opposed co exclusion from Board) apart from quite general one that unless third member of Board is also a Signatory he cannot in long run lold balance evenly.

They required an admission that Persia herself had a right to these 'privileges”.

I said that this seemed to me out of the question and that m any case 1 fad no authority to discuss it. ^ster for Foreign .affairs retorted that if principle of exchange were accepted details could be discussed later. 5. My general impression from both conversations is t^at if safeguarding formula can be devised it may still be possible to sink Persian demands about sovereignty and secure acceptance of 1914 line on river but only with considerable pressure, if in some way His Majesty’s Government could step in as guarantors it might have good effect, if this formula is impossible we shall have to fall back on anchorage. 6 .

I saw Nuri this morning and ootained his consent to my making to Kazerni proposal in third paragraph. We agreed that it seemed protable that Persian Government wanted to avoid return to Geneva and that therefore the best attitude for me to adopt with Kazemi would be in the first instance to put this proposal to him as the only alternative to re turning to Geneva and seeking legal decision. We further agreed that if this failed I should at the proper time and after further consultation with Nuri put forward anchorage proposal but in such a way as to make it clear that it must be taken or left and could not be the subject of bargaining. 2. Incidentally Nuri told me he had instructions from Bagdad that Persian draft treaty was unacceptable and that lie must negotiate for exchange of notes or other preliminary agreement, the details to be filled in later. Prom the point of view of Conservancy Board we agreed that this was preferable as it avoided Persian suggestion to include con servancy convention as an integral part of the treaty. We decided for the moment that it would be better to concentrate on securing definition of Shatt-el-Arab frontier and for me not yet to speak as authorized in your telegram (? 152) unless Kazemi gave me an opening (which he did not). Nuri felt that if Persian Government could be induced to define river7 ' 2. river frontier his position for securing our inclusion in co.noer&lt;/ancy convencion v/oulcl 'be stro.-.jger• ( 'Juri does not yet appear to have spoken to Kazemi as he suggested - see my telegram Jo. 259, first paragraph). 5. 1 then saw Minister for foreign Affairs and spoke in the sense oi first three paragraphs of your telegram adding' that definition of river frontier appeared to me all the more necessary as Persian Government although they had said they would ask for no alteration had made proposals in their draft treaty which directly conflicted with this statement. 4. Kazemi was greatly disappointed but maintained that my proposals were entirely unacceptable and stated that he was quite ready to return to Geneva (though not to go to The Hague), i fear I failed to move him from this position. In bne course of our conversation he said Persia did not ask for thalweg and would be ready to modify two objectionable pro posals in his draft treaty about the river frontier (see my telegram No. 261, paragraph 4). I told him I understood his draft treaty was unacceptable and he replied that he was quite ready to negotiate on the basis of furl’s proces-verbal ±0T a preliminary) agreement, (The objection to this men tioned at the end of paragraph 7 of my telegram no. 261 was its allusion to 1914 frontier settlement, furi tells me he is quite ready to take this out). 5. furl has since seen Kazemi and pressed for re definition of river frontier, no progress seems to have been made and it will be necessary to wait surd see whether our language produces any effect, I have since repeated it in long conversation with Schelly and Secretary-General——oi Iraqi Foreign Office 6 , I have suggest 3 d to nuri that if proposal in third paragraph of your telegram is finally (? rejected) it would he well for him to see the Shah before we fall hack on anchorage proposal.

He has informed Kazemi. On August 12th Persians put forward written proposals for a draft treaty of friendship of which following are the main features (a) redefinition of land boundary on. old basis and demarcation, (b) a statement describing right tank of the Shatt-el-Arab as Iraqi and left bank as Persian and naming islands belonging to each. This article also provided for a special convention for conservancy and navigation of Shatt-el- Arab which would form an integral part of treaty, (c) a draft conservancy board convention providing that each party shall be responsible for administration of river n in waters adjacent to its shore'. This clearly presupposes a thalweg or median line of division. Draft also provides for 2 Iraqi and 2 Persian members of board with right to co-opt one member of a nother nationality. Iraqi delegation have sent text of these proposals to Bagdad for instructions and hope to induce Iraqi. Government to take final and definite decision as to their desiderata. Meanwhile2. Meanwhile there is a lull hut Nuri is preparing a proces-verbal to hand Kazemi as a counterblast to these Persian proposals. Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs in conversation with Nuri and me is showing inclination to bluster about not going back to Geneva ©r to the Hague• Kazerni after interview reported in my telegram No.255 ? suggested to Nuri that latter should ask me to telegraph to you for formula but has since admitted to Nuri that he had already approached me himself. Nuri’s diagnosis of situation is that if formula cannot be agreed upon proposal to lease anchorage can be put up as a deus ex machina. So far there has been no mention of anchorage by either side. Pie agrees with me that anchorage solution is preferable to a formula which falls short of being watertight, as it would either be necessary to define limits of Iraqi sovereignty or they would be implied in lease« Last night Nuri seemed inclined to think anchorage proposal should be made at the proper moment by some outside party and suggested Polish Minister. I am very doubtful of this and rather prefer to keep negotiations between Iraq, Persia and Great Britain. I reminded Nuri that Persians had themselves advocated this at an earlier stage. Moment seems to be near for me to speak as authorised in your telegram No.152 and I propose to discuss this with Nuri forthwith.

Your telegram No. 257 (of August 14th: Perso-Iraqi frontier disputes). Kazemi still appears to Toe playing with ideas which he has heen told repeatedly are inrpossihle.

I agree that it is undesirable to make Abadan proposal through a fourth party. It is not new, having heen made by rapporteur at Geneva, and although Kazemi presumably has no need to raise it so long as he is holding out for l! thalweg' or for conspiracy of silence, he is not likely to have forgotten it or to let it go by default.

Your telegram No.255 (of August 9th: Perso-Iraqi frontier dispute). I well understand Nuri’s inability to agree to M. Kazemi's desire for a conspiracy of silence. It seems unwise, even if it is practicable, to leave the river frontier '’in the air”, and incidentally re-definition of land frontier plus conservancy board convention, without re-definition of river frontier might only increase doubts about latter. In any case it seems too much to expect Iraqi Government to make far-reaching practical concessions which they now contemplate without some assurance that they will henceforth be secure against Persian challenge to validity of river frontier* 2. I am advised that satisfactory formula of the kind which Kazemi and Nuri are seeking is probably unattainable. Any such formula must be either so positive as to be little different from actual re-definition or so ambiguous as to be unsafe and to admit of future disputes. Such disputes might arise at once because the formula would at once attract notice and enquiries as to its meaning and effect and statements in reply would be made and Persian Government might not acquiesce in explanation that in effect Iraq had retained 1914 frontier. 5. Only completely satisfactory solution is therefore re-definition of v/hole frontier water as well as land, and thisis solution which you should use your influence to induce the Persians to accept. Following are however some suggestions for making this solution somewhat less conspicuous and unpalatable to Persian Government* (a) Persian Government would not need to make any admission as regards past (still less recognise former frontier settlements). New instrument in which river frontier was defined could be so worded as to indicate that they only agree that in the futur e frontier should be as defined* (b) Instrument could moreover indicate that Persian consent to this frontier was given in consideration of their participation in Conservancy Board and other agree ments which could be so arrayed as to make whole trans action look as much as possible like a Persian success* It would say for instance that notwithstanding territorial divisions there should be close co-operation between the two countries in customs and police matters and in the administration and conservancy of the Shatt-el-iirab as a whole, the modalities in both cases to be settled in separate agreements* (N.B. Mo Kazemi r s idea that the Conservancy Board should be embodied in a Perso-Iraqi treaty needs careful watching) c 4* Assuming however that Persian Government decline to accept re-defintion in any form, least unsatisfactory formula would be one by which Iraq ceded or leased to Persia an area of water opposite Abadan (thus clearly implying that both parties agreed that Iraq had sovereignty over these waters because otherwise she could not cede or lease), no reference be inn 7\''lbeing made elsewhere to river frontier* Conclusion of such an agreement would add one more presumption in favour of view that Iraq owned whole of river up to 1914 frontier and that Persia had admitted this. But it would be a presumption only, though a strong one, and. not an absolute legal bar to a future claim by Persia, that except at Abadan, she had made no admission about river frontier. This formula is of course only possible if grant oi Abadan anchorage (which from your telegrams Nos. z52 and 255 (of August 9th) may no longer be necessary) in fact forms part of eventual settlement. But in that case (and especially if it is ceded in full sovereignty) Nuri might possibly be able by a last effort to induce Persian Government to agree to re-definition of the whole river frontier on the strength of it. 5. Failing both re-definition and anchorage formula, least that would be necessary would be statement by Iraqi representative when Council took cognisance of withdrawal of dispute that Iraq reserved all her rights as to 1914 frontier in the river. But we have not yet reached stage at which we need contemplate such a doubtfully satisfactory solution. 6. As regards Kazemi, I can only suggest that you should put the proposals in paragraph 5 to him as '’formulas”, but you should first ascertain that Nuri does not mind how much final agreement is made to look like Persian success provided he wins the battle; and you will not of course without further reference to me make any proposals to the Persians which Nuri finds'IF'. » ’ &lt; vy Qf WO DISTRIBUTION, »W*^ „ Lecypher.

AAAA/vAAAAAAA.AAAAA/'.A My telegram No.250 last paragraph. Objections are based on supposition that Persians may establish a naval base or other shipping centre at Sheikh village i.e. between Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s refinery and their 'danger zone' where highly inflammable material is stored. This base would be situated on portion of river where traffic is very heavy. Results that are feared are: (a) Interference with free navigation which would affect all concerned and Anglo-Persian Oil Company in parti cular. (b) Increased danger of fire through collisions or carelessness in a highly dangerous zone. (c) Undesirability for Iraq of naval base so close to their frontier though this is lessened by fact that the base already exists at Mohammeran. 2. In so far as these dangers affect iraq ( and ( c) in particular) it seems to me possible that they could be provided against in terms of lease or act of cession. There must be plenty of precedents where one party in ceding or leasing territory to another has made conditions to protect itself against similari similar dangers, 3, As regards (a) and (b) it would seem that curing the life-time of conservancy board they could be adequately provided against though mere fact of additional shipping entailed by establishment of such a base would greatly increase danger* Matter would seem to concern Anglo-Persian Oil Company in part i cul ar (see my imme di at el y f ol lowing t el egr am). 4.

I replied that I thought the main Iraqi objection was that unless position was clearly defined in writing on ex piration of Conservancy Board Iraqi sovereignty in Shatt-el- Arab would once more become a live issue and Persian claims might be revived. His Excellency, who in conversation still laid some stress on what he called illegality of present position, argued that this fear on the part of Iraqi delega tion was of no importance in view of joint administration by Conservancy Board which gave equal rights in practice and so relegated sovereignty question to limbo. I said that might be so if Conservancy Board were to last for ever- and not merely for fifty years. His Excellency replied that he had no objection to Board lasting indefinitely and suggested that it should be comprised in Perso-Iraqi Treaty which will result from present negotiations. I promised to ask whether you could suggest a formula and His Excellency expressed the hope that you would be able to send very early reply as he was most anxious to reach settlement in the next few days 0 I consider it would certainly be helpful if you could suggest a formula which would have to safeguard Iraqi sovereignty while avoiding mention of Persian admission thereof. Formula would, I presume, be embodied in article in proposed treaty in which signatories agree to establish ment of Conservancy Board. Alternatively if the questions of smuggling, police, customs procedure,etc., are to be dealt with in separate convention it might be better to draft this convention in such a way that it presupposes Iraqi sovereign ty.

I spoke to Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday on general nes indicated in your telegrams 188 and 189 hut without mentioning ~ ~ ~ ' mens ions of anchorage at Abadan suggested in Admiralty tter (your despatch 501). Colonel Ward is strongly opposed for chnical reasons to an anchorage as wide as 100 yards. Minister for Foreign Affairs in reply informed me that he uld only outline instructions he would receive before leaving r Tehran today as they had been subject to much last minute scussion in Council of Ministers and he was still not sure of eir exact nature. Minister of the Interior had proved structive and unwilling to make any concession to Persians and though Nuri repeated that conservancy board had been finally cep ted by the Cabinet, Prime Minister told me later that this •S only true so far as concerned the clauses dealing with vigation. Position now seems to be that Nuri will be authorised to ! ek Persian agreement to these parts of the convention. He will d be authorised to make any proposal about Abadan anchorage but •11 merely endeavour to ascertain how Persian Government would 'act if suggestion of a leased anchorage were made to them. ' personally is confident that should this prove to be the only Ant standing in the way of complete agreement, Iraqi Government L 11 not make difficulties. As regards customs he will try for a regularisation on basisof an Iraqi proposal made in 1924 of the present de facto arrangement whereby Persian customs officials actually do visit vessels lying in the stream. He has discretion also to discuss joint measures for prevention of smuggling. As regards quarantine he is to ascertain how Persian customs would react to a suggestion (which appears most convenient and feasible) that all sanitary inspections etc. should be carried out at Fao where Iraqi Government contemplate constructions under Colonel Ward’s supervision of an up-to-date quarantine station. Council of Ministers agreed that bon voisinage and oil agreements should be discussed on lines suggested by Iraq, in 1951. I gathered that Puri’s present mission will amount to little more than an extended enquiry designed to ascertain probable beads of agreement. He anticipates that if his report is \ favourable details will be left for further discussion in the autumn u I assume that this caution is intended to allow time for objections of Minister of the Interior to be overcome.

Definite acceptance of British participation in Conservancy Board hy Iraqi government is most satisfactory. 2. His majesty*s Government entirely/ agree with Furl Pasha that customs and smuggling should he dealt with in a separate agreement. 3. With regard to quarantine, articles 4 and 5 of draft Conservancy Convention give Board power to deal with sanitary questions. His Majesty^ Government do not know what points separate agreement about quarantine is intended to cover, and without fuller information would not wish to suggest that no such agreement should he made. But they would urge that in technical discussions great care should he taken to avoid any duplication of auohoiity and any encroachment on powers which Board will need within its own jurisdiction 4. For your own confidential, information, principal objection to bilateral convention is lack of security as regards duration. His Majesty’s Government might he ^iven same vote and therefore same powers as two sign^tOxies, hut if latter agreed to terminate convention before expiry t of its full term or to vary it so as oo exclude His Majesty’sEven Majesty T s Government from the Board, His Majesty ? s Government would have no legal ground for objection, if one signatory denounced it illegally ? His Majesty’s Government would have no locus standi for supporting other signatory* These dangers could he partially surmounted if one of signatories gave His Majesty’s Government separate assurances against premature denun ciation or variation. But such assurances would he difficult to publish and unless published would have little value. If, on the other hand, both signatories were willing to give them they would presumably be willing to accept His Majesty Ms Government as signatory. 5. His Majesty v s Government are therefore definitely averse to idea of a bilateral convention. They cannot however actually prevent parties signing such a convention and danger of their doing has always been realized. Moreover, it is conceivable that bilateral convention admitting of British participation might be preferable to no convention at all, although I cannot yet state that this would be view of His Majesty ? s Government. 6 0 Meanwhile you shoula take any ouoojvuinity of dis creetly discouraging Nuri from, pursuing this idea, and you should of course not suggest that His Majesty’s Government might accept it even in last resort* 7. For rest, I can only leave general tactics to Nuri and wish him success c i would however urge him if only for the sake of Iraqi position at Geneve, to make Abadan anchorage offer, in however modified a form.

He added however that no formal Cabinet decision had as yet been taken. He was now seeking the best means of overcoming opposition which he foresaw on the part of the Persians and following possible courses of action had suggested themselves to him - 1. that he should try to secure Persian acceptance of the main provisions of Conservancy Board and when this was achieved he should pro pose to the Persians that His Majesty's Government should par ticipate in subsequent negotiation of text and in due course as a signatory. He said it would fortify his proposal tor British participation if at a time to be agreed between him and His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, Mr. Hugessen were authorised to remind Persian Government of important British shipping interests in the Shatt—el—Arab and to urge upon them advantages of accepting Iraqi Government's offer of Conservancy Board. 2.

Nuri Pasha tells me that as a result of his visit to Basra and his report to the Cabinet Iraqi Government have now decided that (l) there should be no cession or lease of anchorage at .Abadan. As a result however of a conversation, at which I was present, with Colonel Ward who put forward convincing technical arguments in favour of lease co terminous with Conservancy Board of a narrow strip of water, Nuri is v/avering and may be willing to concede this much although he is doubtful whether it would satisfy Persia. (2) Negotiations should include questions concerning control of customs, quarantine and smuggling in Shatt-el-Arab. Nuri thinks provisions for this control might be embodied either in (a) conservancy board convention or (b) Bon Voisinage agreement. He foresees however that (a) v-ould stiffen Persian objections to British participation because it would involve point of sovereignty inappropriate to a three-member board.

Their Lordships note that there is a possibility that the Iraqi Government will offer to cede to Persia an anchorage off Abadan. I am to point out that Their Lordships would be deeply concerned in my such proposal, having regard to the dependence of the Fleet on oil embarked at Abadan. Their Lordships would therefore be glad to be informed at the earliest possible moment exactly what proposals the Iraqi 'Government intend to make in this respect, hhi1st They deprecate the cession of any waters to Persia, They would prefer to await fuller information before remarking further on the present proposal. They presume taat in any case it is intended that the navigable channel shall remain wholly in Iraqi waters and that no concession will be made unless the Persian Government are prepared to accept the tripartite Conservancy Convention.

Their Lordshins understand the position to be that imri Pasha, accompanied possibly by Yasin pasha, will shortly proceed to Tehran v,ith the object of negotiating directly with the Persian Government. They also understand that certain proposals have been made for an adjustment of the existing frontier above Buwarda, and that it is desirable that H.L. ■ Representative at Bagdad snd Tehran should be aware of the limits within which concessions may be made without prejudice to the requirements of H.M. Government in the river. frontier which have been made fall under three heads 1. The suggestion that a narrow strip of water off Abadan should be leasee, or cedea to Persia. 2. The suggestion that a 'thalweg' frontier should be conceded between Tuweijat and Buwerda. 3. The suggestion that a 'thalweg' frontier should be substituted for the existing 'medium filum aquae” in the The proposals for readjustment of the river between the junction o Khaiin and Tuweijat. unction o Taking these three possible concessionsin order, I am to observe that the concession of a strip of water to Persia off Abadan would mean that vessels ta&amp;irifc in oil at the jetties would lie wholly within Persian waters, whereas under the existing arrangement they remain in Iraqi waters. Their Lordships understand the legal position to be that, in a war in which Persia was neutral, this alteration would not prejudice the export of oil for warlike purposes from Abadan in mercantile oilers, as distinct from oilers in direct and regular attendance upon the fleet, on the other hand, in vie® of Hague convention XIII, Articles 5, 18, 19 and 20, it would, under the proposed arrangement, be impossible for H.k. Ships or for oilers in direct and regular attendance upon the fleet to oil alongside the jetties, save possibly at long intervals and in restricted quantities. They presume, however, that these difficulties could be overcome by mooring an oil barge or barges, from which such vessels could draw their supplies, in Iraqi waters at the buoys opposite Abadan. (in the assumption that the Secretary of fctate is satisfied as to the correctness of the views set out above. Their Lordships are prepared to agree that no serious British interests would be prejudiced if a strip approximately 100 yards wide measured from low water mark, and extending between the limits marked on the enclosed copy of chart Ho.3844 , were granted to Persia, provided that Persia in return accepted the Conservancy Convention substanta.ly as drafted in London. As far as They can judge from the Hydrographic information in Their possession it—- 3 - would be important that the northern limit of this concession shonfo jibe above, and if possible, should be below, the limit marked on the chart, In order to ensure that an adequate channel for the passage of Troop ships, etc. to Basra should be left In Iraqi waters. As for the southern end of the strip, the precise position of this does not seem to be very material from a purely navigational point of view. They suggest, however, that £ir Archibald SLarfe Kerr should consult colonel card with the object of ensuring that any concession offered would involve no risk that in tine of war troops or supplies for Basra would be held up owing to the fact that the ship would have to pass through Persian waters. Their Lordships understand that there is no intention of offering any concession in the river except in return for the acceptance of a tripartite conservancy convention to whidh H*M. Government would be party. I m to observe that the existing draft convention should rule out any difficulties arising from dual control in matters of sanitation and navigation, but that any difficulties anticipated in connection with customs would require to be dealt wife b • prior agreement. In order to prevent difficulti* arising should the conservancy convention lapse it would be highly desirable that the strip of water should be leased for the same period as the conser vancy convention, and not ceded in full sovereignty. As for the second suggestion, namely* that a 'thalweg' frontier should be conceded between tuweljat and Buwarda, Their Lordships are of opinion that this concession should be strongly resisted. They understand that at certain times of the year a / channel** jtj. •» chafixiel in tiie neifciitourliosxl of the hoimkaerah Bex wide enoufeh for a single large ship is only maintained with difficulty, so that vessels passing up to Basrah would have to pass through Persian waters - an arrangement which would, in Their view, make it extremely difficult to mainttln forces in , Iraq in a war in which Persia was neutral. More over, the safe 11; its of eny concession Immediately above Abadan do not, as explained above, extend to the 'thalweg”. ft 1th regard to the third suggestion, namely, that the frontier which now follows the ’’medium film aquae' above Tuweijat should be transferred to the 'thalweg”, I am to enclose a chart (10.3845) which allows the existing frontier and the proposed 'thalweg' frontier ^^ nearly as can be ascertained from the information available in London. The ’’thalweg' frontier has been inserted by divining the channel between the 3 fathom lines equally, and no attasspt has been made to follow the line of deepest water which would lead to quite different results. The position of the existing frontier is not entirely free from doubt, owing to the fact that the island referred to by the CGasaioeion who del Baited, the frontier as 'buifi sr Bass' Is now niarked on the chart as I-abba Island, and the name 'tmarassa' Is given to a smaller island lying nearer the Iraqi shore; end furthemore, the identification on the modem chart of the watercourse 'Hahr— el—rnaiin, where tii® frontier leaves the river, is not positive. Tneir Lordships would be glad if it could be confirmed, through H.M. Ambassador.Bagdad, that the correct watercourse has been taken on the enclosed chart. / Soyvi - 5 - So far as My Lords can Judge from the hydrographic information at Their disposal, the existing channel from the hahr-ei-Khaiin to Tuveijat (which they Tinderstand lies some distance above the Mohamiiierah Bar) is sufficiently wide at all times of the year to permit the passage of large vessels . without encroaching on that half of the channel which would lie in Persian waters if a 'thalweg' frontier were conceded. jo. the assuaption that this is correct, and having regard to the doubt as to the existing boundary mentioned above. My Lords are disposed to take the vie* that a 'thalweg' frontier would be definitely preferable to the present front!® within this portion of the river.

This file was last submitted in March (P.Z. 1812/35) Yiz. after the conclusion of the January session of the Council of the League of Nations. The present is a convenient opportunity to submit it once more as we now have a report on the events at the May session of the Council. It will, of course, be remembered that the 1914^made the Persian frontier the Persian bank of the Shatt- Arab (except for an anchorage at Mo hammer ah, also laid down the land boundp,yy going southwards (yxlUMtr to the Shatt. The^Persianf! ha&amp; never recognised this frontier which places the whole of/ 3330 1000 12.34of the Shatt-el-Arab outside Persia and ha^&amp; consistently claimed that the frontier should run down the middle of the waterway. In 1934 thejf brought the matter to a head by violating the A a land frontier and instruct®*^.their war vessels to disregard navigational regulations in the Shatt- el-Arab. Iraq accordingly appealed to the League of Nations. This put into the background the desultory negotiations for a general settlement between the two countries which had in 1932 shown some signs of coming to a head by the conclusion of various agreements covering a Conservancy Board lor the Shatt- el- Arab^neighbourly, extradition, residence and commercial agreements^, conventions or treaties^and^ settlement^ to regulate the exploitation by the A.P.O.C. of the oilfield lying astride the land frontier. It will be remembered (1.2.1214/35 and 1812/35) that when the dispute came before the League the Italians managed to secure the job of rapporteur and showed a disquieting tendency to ravour the Persian side. Little progress was made at the January session. Before the May session Baron Aloisi had changed his assistants and the new representatives Signori Soragna and who Scaduto/hatitt'actually been dealing with the dispute have behaved much more properly. a concise narrative is given in the confidential report on P.Z. 4787, flagged below. As will be seen the rapporteur put forward a compromise, the main features of 'which were.irate Paper, Department 1 ) iiofy-v^k ^ ua in '4kM , (a) that the land and river frontiers should be re-defined on the lines of the 1914 convention, modified to the extent that the Persians would be given an anchorage off Abadan as well as off Mohammerah. (Abadan was not a port of any importance in 1914 and was therefore not provided for in the Convention. ) (b) that a Conservancy Board should be set up to regulate navigation on the Shatt-el-Arab, the Board to consist of five members. This compromise was rejected out of hand by the Persians. It was also rejected by the Iraqis on the attsAMai#! that the Conservancy Board ahfould consist of three, viz. Persia, Iraq and one other, as proposed in 1932, and not of five, which would give it a foreign majority. No real progress was therefore made at the May session, but it was suggested that direct negotiations should be initiated between Persia and Iraq. The present idea is that t the Iraqi Pr f mo -Mini s te-r—and {&gt;4&lt;kAf)S tk ft*** Foreign Minister should go to Teheran for discussions with the Persian Government. There appears to be a faint hope that the legal question may be put to sleep and the various agreements foreshadowed in 1932 reconsidered on their merits. The difficulty aoout this from the Iraq point of view is, of course, that ral 29 56 6000 7/34 the P&amp;ddirhg question having been raised at Geneva, they are anxious to have a definite decision on the fiontier which could not in the future be challenged by Persia. Persia, while no doubt fee ready to acquie sce in the frentier, provided satisfactory arrangements are made for Abadan, obviously do not wish to make any f orm al statement/statement on the subject. The Admiralty are very nervous about proposed concessions at Abadan for fear that they may interfep with the access along the waterway to Basra. The India Office, of course, have the same interest in the matter as the Admiralty, but it seems quite possible that some sort of arrangements could be made at Abadan which would leave the main channel quite outside Persian territory.

Communicated by Mr. C. J. Edmonds, Second Adviser in Iraqi Ministry of the Interior and Unofficial Adviser in Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs .— {Received June 11.) (A)— Narrative of Events. I ARRIVED in Geneva on the morning of the 17th May. Nuri Pasha and Muhammad Zaki Beg had already been there since the i5th. The Persian Minister in London, Ala, arrived on the 16th; Kazimi did not come until the 20th. 2. On the morning of the 17th it was understood that the secretariat now contemplated procedure whereby the juridical question should be submitted to a body of jurists in three stages : (1) Are the instruments laying down the boundary valid and, if so, to what extent ? (2) In the light of the answer to No. (1), where should the line of the boundary run ? (3) In the light of the answers to Nos. (1) and (2), what are the rights and obligations devolving upon each of the two parties in the matter of transit navigation, &amp;c. 3. Nuri Pasha saw Signor Pilotti at 11-30 that morning. The procedure outlined above bore a certain resemblance to the suggestion thrown out by Signor Pilotti when I saw him in Rome (see my Narrative of Events at Rome, Appendix F, paragraph 11). Surprisingly, however, he made no reference to it, but pressed upon Nuri Pasha what was known to be the Iranian idea of a settlement, viz., that a navigation and conservancy arrangement for the Shatt-el- Arab should be pushed forward, and that the juridical issue should, in fact, be allowed to lie dormant—the boundary was there, so why worry ? 4. Nuri Pasha and Zaki and Muzahim Begs met the new representatives of the rapporteur, Signori Soragna and Scaduto, at the secretariat that afternoon, the 17th May. M. Fachiri and I joined them later. M. Lisicky was present throughout, Signor Pilotti for a time. Neither of the methods of procedure referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 was discussed. Nuri Pasha emphasised the essentially juridical nature of the dispute, and described the Tehran arrangement of 1932 which had been announced to the public in a communique drafted in his own hand by Feroughi, then Minister for Foreign Affairs and now Prime Minister of Iran (Appendix A); he also described how attempts to deal with current questions frequently broke down owing to the fundamental difference of opinion as to the existence of the boundary. Signor Soragna asked for details which Nuri Pasha promised to furnish later. 5. The 1932 draft Conservancy Board Agreement had, it appeared, never been approved by any Iraqi Cabinet. It was therefore considered necessary to telegraph to Bagdad for authority to negotiate with a view to obtaining simultaneously a settlement of the juridical issue (by Iranian recognition or a decision of the Permanent Court) and the conclusion of three agreements on questions arising out of the boundary, i.e., three of the six discussed at Tehran. 6. On the 18th May a note (Appendix B) was prepared summarising the principal provisions of the three agreements regarding the Shatt-el-Arab, the Naftkhana oil-field and neighbourly relations (covering the division of the waters of minor streams). 7. On the 19th May a telegram was received from Bagdad asking for further explanations. It was therefore not considered possible to communicate this summary to Signor Soragna at the meeting held that day. Translations of letters exchanged in February between the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Iranian Legation in Bagdad (Appendix C) were, however, handed to him, and Nuri Pasha described verbally the main lines of the proposed conservancy and 8031 [11867] bneighbourly relations agreements. Signor Soragna did not show any particular interest in the oil question. 8. It emerged from the conversation that three methods of procedure might be contemplated : {a) A reference of the juridical issue to the Permanent Court' (b) the grant by Iraq of the conservancy agreement in exchange for Iranian recognition of the boundary; (c) Iranian agreement to refer the issue to the Permanent Court in exchange for the three agreements, these to come into force simultaneously with the decision, whatever its nature. Nuri Pasha asked the rapporteur to press {a) and (b) on the Iranians, and promised to discuss (c) further if he failed to obtain their consent. 9. On the 20th May a reply was sent to Bagdad telegram of the 19th {paragraph 7). Nuri Pasha saw Baron Aloisi in the evening. Baron Aloisiwas apologetic regarding the events at Rome, emphasised the difficulty of his position, and explained that he was now convinced that the juridical and practical aspects of the problem should be dealt with by parallel efforts. 10. On the 21st May a telegram was received from Bagdad approving of the negotiation of the conservancy agreement in exchange for Iranian recognition of the boundary. A further telegram was sent asking for authority to agree to method (c) of the lines of procedure referred to in paragraph 8. 11. On the 22nd May it was understood that the Iranian delegation had submitted to the rapporteur a draft conservancy and navigation agreement. The text has not been communicated to the Iraqi delegation. 12. In the evening of the 22nd May a letter (Appendix D) was suddenly received from the rapporteur together with a draft proposal (Appendix E) and explanatory note (Appendix F). The proposal provided for: (a) Reaffirmation of the 1914 boundary throughout its length, but modified as in (6); (6) extension of the Mohammerah anchorage southwards to a point opposite Bawarda below Abadan, giving Iran half the river for about 20 miles instead of 6 as at present (in the formula the thalweg is substituted for the median line); (c) withdrawal of the Iranian police posts in Iraqi territory, decision regarding the Barkhosh fields, and settlement of the questions of the waters of streams crossing the boundary; (d) conclusion of a conservancy and navigation agreement. 13. The Iraqi delegation replied on the 23rd May (Appendix G) recalling the essentially juridical nature of the case, reminding the rapporteur of the point where the negotiations with him had been left on the 19th May (see paragraphs), and stating that the proposal based on a cession of territory by Iraq to Iran was unacceptable. It was also made plain that the suggestion that the Conservancy Board should be formed of five members, giving the foreign element a majority over the riparians, could not be accepted. (This matter is further discussed in Part B of this note, paragraphs 24, 25 and 26.) 14. A few additional criticisms of the rapporteur's proposals and arguments, prepared at the time but not used, are attached for convenience of reference (Appendix H). 15. The Iranian delegation was understood to have rejected the rapporteur's proposal out of hand with contumely. 16. In the afternoon of the same day Nuri Pasha saw Signor Soragna and gave him to understand that, if an agreement had been in sight on all othei points and there had remained only the matter of the curious status of snips loading and unloading at Abadan, he might have felt able to ask his Governmen and its technical advisers to study the possibility of giving to Iran some special anchorage facility there; he would not wish to wreck an otherwise certain settlement on that point alone. aln 17. On the 24th May Signor Soragna called with Signor Scaduto. ® stated that he had already begun to prepare his report. He proposed to revi in very general terms the progress of the discussions without referring speci ca . to the respective attitudes of the parties or the lines of his recommendation. 1 ~ — U-L-lVy j^dJL LI 1 C ±±±lCk&gt; UL HID -L — 1 ' p rapporteur would probably ask for a credit to allow him to take legal a (This last proposal seemed useless, but the delegation did not feel it could pre the rapporteur from getting any help he might feel he required; it isun ers that the Iranians actually objected; in any case, the proposal did not app m the draft report received.) ' ' ,• p 18. On the afternoon of the 25th May a cleverly drafted report (Appen 1 j was received from Signor Soragna. Without entering into details it r® . the course of discussions at Rome and at Geneva in such general terms: ^C *£&gt;) 3 parties were able to accept it with only slight verbal emendations; at the same ,| eeiI % time it managed to convey an impression of feverish activity on the part of the f 1 S 8 ®to|[; rapporteur since last January. is»■. ig. The case came before the Council late in the afternoon of the 2:5th May, totf|, the last meeting of the session. Neither of the parties desired to renew any eemeil Ml| acrimonious discussion on what did not amount to more than a proposal for na ^ C adjournment; their speeches were short and anodyne, and texts had been Q dpro%v exchanged beforehand. Similar speeches were made by the United Kingdom and Soviet delegates. M. Aras, of Turkey, wdio last January had preferred to 3 %y (fW remain urbane and neutral rather than vacate the presidential chair, evidently desired to make amends for the disappointment he had caused the Iranians on used ill' that occasion; in a speech that sounded singularly inappropriate after the studied lejurife moderation of the declarations of Iraqi and Iranian delegates, he paid a series [forts, of fulsome compliments to the Shah, and recommended the parties to stop arguing work at Geneva are in my opinion not unsatisfactory. The new representative ter (Appl [r 0 f rapporteur, Signor Soragna, is superior in calibre to his predecessors, raft projiti:: MM. Biancheri and Guarnaschelli; for the first time the rapporteur seemed to providedk have studied the case and to be genuinely seeking a sound solution, modified « 21. The points I would note as marking an improvement in the situation .pointop: are the following :— (1) Discussion of the Italian treaty has ceased to intrude on discussions of the boundary question. (2) The attempt to inveigle Iraq into giving up in advance all effective control of the Shatt-el-Arab under a “temporary arrangement intended to become permanent ” has been abandoned. (3) The mania of the secretariat to internationalise something at all costs has been in some measure checked. (4) The idea entertained by both the rapporteur and the secretariat of they must object a fortiori to a body of lesser standing. (5) The false emphasis given to the Shatt-el-Arab has been modified, ^id the rapporteur has been brought to realise that there are problems arising out of the boundary for which Iraq is also entitled to demand a solution. -moo (6) The rapporteur has himself adopted the theory at any rate ot the lyo ' ' LL _ n . -I 1 * 1 * / • 1 * 1 fl -4-T-V TT/•%-»-» -f T o about the legal values of treaties and protocols and to f ollow his own example by making an agreement de novo. (B)— A ppreciation. 20. Though nothing positive has been achieved, the results of the session’s obtaining a hole-and-corner ruling on the juridical aspects by some inferior body of jurists has also been abandoned; in justice to the Iranians it must be mentioned that their attitude seems to have been that, if they objected to the intervention of the Permanent Court,composition of the board); these might not have taken the exact form thev H i or must have been described as counter-proposals. The reference to the ne lf hourly relations agreement might also have been more precise. 1 ^' 24. It is, of course, a debatable point whether the Iraqi delegation entirely well advised to reject the rapporteur’s proposal as firmly as it did in? letter of the 23rd May (Appendix G), rather than to agree in writing to refer th question of the cession at Abadan to the Government of Bagdad. In favour f the second alternative it could be reasonably urged : (a) that the conciliatory spirit there shown would strengthen the position of Iraq tactically before the Council; (5) that the underlying idea of the proposal was the reaffirmation of the 1914 line both on land and on the Shatt, that this was a point gained but that unqualified rejection by both parties might lead the rapporteur to treat the proposal as never made and open the road to less desirable recommendations in the autumn; (c) that a more forthcoming attitude would conciliate the rapporteur in a manner advantageous to Iraq. Against it could be urged (a) that Iran had not moved one inch from the attitude adopted before the request had been made to the League at all, that Iran bad shown no signs of agreeing to the general conception of the parallel settlement of the juridical and practical issues, and that any dallying with the idea of the cession of territory, however carefully any written communication might be drafted, would only have the result that the cession proposed by the rapporteur would be taken as a starting point for further bargaining; (b) that if the rapporteur had not been conciliated by the attitude of Iraq as compared with that of Iran, which was refusing to agree to any kind of procedure to ensure a settlement, then nothing would conciliate him; (c) that the attitude of the secretariat was not necessarily a good guide since, in the nature of things, the secretariat must at all times be anxious to get any solution, the quality of the solution being a secondary consideration, and that it was therefore likely to exercise the greater pressure on the side shown by experience to be the more accommodating or pliant. 25. While the matter of confirming in writing Nuri Pasha’s verbal declara tion (paragraph 16) was still under consideration, Signor Soragna called and gave an indication of the lines on which he proposed to draft his report (para graph 17); in the light of this, argument {a) in favour of a written confirmation lost its force. As regards argument (5), whether as the result of Nuri Pasha’s verbal declaration or not, the rapporteur’s report, accepted by both parties, does, by referring to the proposal and suggesting that the parties should report to their Governments the various solutions suggested, serve to keep the proposal alive to any extent that one or other of the parties may wish. (C )—Future Policy. 26. Prima facie I think that the policy of the Iraqi Government should be to give to the proposals of the rapporteur in their main lines a concrete shape acceptable to Iraq. This would be done by putting forward to the Iranians and to the rapporteur as soon as possible draft conservancy and navigation, neighbourly relations, and oil ( t4 Naftkhana ”) agreements. An offer might be made to lease to Iran, for a nominal sum and for the duration of the Conservancy Convention, a reasonable anchorage at Abadan (which, however, cannot be allowed to come out as far as the thalweg and so encroach on the principal navigable channel). By this means it would be possible to give to Iran satisfac tion in the matter of ships moored at Abadan, the anomalous situation of which furnishes the most telling arguments in favour of the demand for revision, without compromising the basic position taken up by Iraq, viz., that the legal boundary cannot be altered, but that all difficulties can be overcome by appropriate administrative arrangements. C. J LAppendix A. fommunique drafted by Feroughi, Minister for Foreign Affairs, at the close of ^ the Tehran Conversations of 1932, and 'published simultaneously in Bagdad and Tehran. i reiMi iedl™ ?e toteffl! risk The statesmen of the Iraqi and Iranian Governments took advantage of the fortunate opportunity afforded to them by the visit of His Majesty King peisal to Tehran and exchanged views regarding all matters of importance to the two countries and regarding the bases on which their relations should rest. They found themselves in complete agreement on all the principles on which their uolicies should proceed, the details to be defined later. It was agreed that an immediate beginning should be made with negotiations for the conclusion of treaties and conventions with the object of settling those questions on the basis of the complete understanding inspired by that spirit of firm friendship between the two countries which has been cemented by the visit of His Majesty the King of Iraq to His Imperial Majesty. Appendix B. (Prepared on May 18, but not used.) (Personal and unofficial.) At the meeting held at the secretariat on the evening of the 17th May the rapporteur asked for details of the arrangements which the Iraqi delegation had in view when it stated that, once the juridical issue was settled and the boundary definitely recognised by the Iranian Government, the problems and difficulties arising out of the alignment of the boundary could be solved in a manner satisfactory to the two parties by certain conventions which had already been mentioned in the course of the discussions. 2. Attached are translations of letters exchanged in February of this year between the Iranian Minister Plenipotentiary in Bagdad and the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the agreements in principle reached at Tehran in 1932; it will be observed that Persia was to recognise the boundary delimited in 1914 and that six agreements were to be negotiated as soon as possible, of which Nos. 1, 2 and 3 were directly connected with problems arising out of the frontier. 3. As regards Convention No. 1, conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab, it is intended that the main provisions shall be as follows :— (a) The Shatt-el-Arab from the point of junction of land-boundary with the river to the sea, and such adjacent Iraqi and Persian waters as it may be technically desirable to include, shall be placed under the control and administrative authority of a Conservancy Board to the extent necessary for fulfilling the functions of the board. {h) The board shall consist of three members appointed respectively by the Iraqi, Iranian and United Kingdom Governments, the seat of the bocii*cl to bo ctt 53cLsi*ci (c) The functions of the board shall include buoying, lighting, pilotage, maintenance of the waterways, making and enforcement of navigation and sanitary regulations, levy of dues on shipping, &amp;c. {d) The navigation of the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab in the area defined under (a) shall be free to all nations; the principle of equality of ^ treatment and non-discrimination as between flags shall apply to all the board’s activities. (e) The revenues of the board shall be devoted exclusively to meet the obligations of the board and the expenditure required to carry out its functions. (/) Nothing in the convention shall affect the rights and duties of the parties as belligerents or neutrals in time of war.As regards Convention 2, it may be explained that the same compan holds the concessions for the exploitation of the Naftkhana oil-field -- T ^ ^ nolds tne concessions ioi tue cApiuitciLiuii u± Liit: iMdiLKncina oii-nclcl m Ir^n exploitation of oil in the adjacent Persian territory. The convention is intended to enable the company to exploit the area as one undivided field, and therefore in the most advantageous manner, technically and economically, with consequent ultimate benefit to the two parties. 4 t j 5. A “ Bon-Voisinage ” agreement is essential for the final appeasement of friction in the boundary region. Its principal provisions would cover (a) C) The rights of nomadic tribesmen of semi-nomadic shepherds to cross the boundary from one country to the other and to enjoy their traditional summer and winter pastures; The fiscal regime to be applied to such elements; Facilities for sedentary villagers established in proximity to the boundary; Grazing facilities for owners of live-stock, other than those covered by (a) in times of drought and natural calamity and the fiscal regime to be applied; Preservation of order. Prevention or punishment of raiding and other disorderly acts by the inhabitants of one territory in the other territory; Procedure for the settlement of disputes between tribesmen or villagers living on different sides of the boundary; Identic rules for the conduct of administrative and military officials in the frontier region in their relations with the corresponding represen tatives of the other party; Formation of a small permanent commission to define the rights of upstream and downstream inhabitants as regards the proportional use of the waters of streams forming the boundary or flowing from one country into the other and, on the demand of either party to supervise the division. p! 81101 licffllt 6. Following the Tehran arrangements of 1932 draft agreements dealing with several of the matters covered had already been exchanged when the sudden reversal of the Iranian attitude regarding recognition of the validity of the boundary interrupted negotiations. liieml tre Appendix C. (Handed to Rajjforteur on May 19.) Letter from the Persian Legation in Bagdad, dated February 13, 1935, to Nuri Pasha, Minister for Foreign A ffairs. (Translation.) My dear Minister, It appears from a telegram which has reached me from his Excellency Kazeini, Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs, that your Excellency had proposed to him that you should go to Tehran and engage in an exchange of views for the settlement of the differences relating to the boundary on the basis of the negotiations of 1932. 1 our Excellency is aware that the Imperial Persian Government was always desirous of settling the said differences direct and in a friendly manner.

V Tear Minister, 1 J I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your Excellency’s letter dated the 13th February, 1935. I desire to confirm the verbal discussion which took Diace between us recently at the Ministry. On that occasion I informed you that when I spoke to the Iranian Minister Plenipotentiary in London, I explained to him that the Iranian Government should either recognise the existing boundary delimited in 1914 or, if it doubted the validity of the Treaty of Erzerum and the Protocol of 1913, it should agree to have recourse to the highest international eourt— namely, the court at The Hague to obtain its advisory opinion on the validity of this treaty and protocol. I added that as soon as the case of the difference of views regarding the present boundary between the two Governments was definitely settled, I could go to Tehran to discuss the difficulties arising out of these boundaries. I explained the same thing to his Excellency the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs in Pome. I request that there may be no misunder standing in this matter. As regards the matters which we discussed in principle in 1932 at the time of the visit of His Majesty the late King Feisal to Tehran, after understanding had been reached with the Iranian negotiator regarding the recognition of the validity of the boundary delimited in 1914, they were as follows :— (1) Regulation of navigation in the Shatt-el-Arab. (2) Exploitation of the oil-field lying astride the Iraqi-Iranian boundary at Naftkhana on the basis of equal participation. (3) A “ Bon-Voisinage ” agreement covering regulation of the frontier zones and the preservation of order there and clear settlement of cases concerning the division of the water of streams on the boundary. (4) An extradition convention. (5) A residence convention. (6) A commercial treaty. I avail, &amp;c. Appendix D. Letter from Rapporteur to Nuri Pasha. Excellence deneve, le 22 mai 1935. J’AI Fhonneur de remettre, sous ce pli, a votre Excellence, de la part du Baron Aloisi, le projet de recommandation au Conseil que nous ayons elabore. Vous y trouverez aussi un bref commentaire aux points principaux. Je me plais a esperer que votre Excellence pourra trouver satisfaisan es es solutions envisagees, qui nous semblent reellement const!tuer 1 unique regiemen vraiment equitable auquel Eon puisse aboutir dans le tres bref delai qui nous separe de la cloture du Conseil. , . Je reste depuis ce moment a la disposition de votre Excellence e je me propose de faire telephoner plus tard a votre delegation pour xer no re prochaine entrevue. Veuillez agreer, &amp;c a o rvn&gt; a nxr a11 era® sty Ira :e pastsiil e CkiiJil leslraii tttlMffltll :ral , ]afr „] iccnes raised by the Iranian Government as the reason for their non- Son of the existing frontier should be decided. Realising that if the Iranian Government were determined to decline having se to a judicial procedure to decide these issues, the Council might find it difficult to adopt this solution, I suggested as a compromise that, if the Iranian Government recognised the existing frontier, the Iraqi Government would be repared to discuss the conclusion of conventions to deal with practical difficulties on the Shatt-el-Arab and elsewhere along the_ frontier. I wish to emphasise that this proposal of mine, made in a spirit of conciliation, was a concession on the part ^ 3 ^ The application of Iraq to the League is based upon Iranian aggressions on the frontier, and strictly speaiking that is the only matter with which the Council is called upon to deal. In consequence of the legal arguments raised on the Iranian side, the validity of the existing frontier was put in issue and my Government immediately expressed its willingness to have that issue judicially determined. In doing this, it was, I submit, fulfilling completely the whole of its duty as a loyal member of the League and as a friendly neighbour to Iran. By making the further suggestion alluded to above, the Iraqi Government was making a distinct concession with a view to a compromise settlement. The basis of that suggestion, however, is recognition of the whole of the existing frontier, and I regret to find that the draft recommendation which you have sent me departs from this essential condition, and proposes substantial modifications whereby a section of the Shatt-el-Arab would be ceded by Iraq to Iran. I fear that it is not possible for me to agree to a settlement on such a basis. 4. Apart from this fundamental point, there is another major objection to the proposals made in the draft recommendation, namely, the suggested compo sition of the Shatt-el-Arab Commission. As I explained to you verbally, niy Government had in mind a commission consisting of an Iraqi and an Iranian member, but as it is obviously necessary to provide against deadlocks we suggested that the two Governments shall agree between themselves upon the appointment of a third member, and I pointed out that in view of the overwhelming prepon derance of British interests in the shipping in the Shatt, the natural solution would be a representative of the Government of the United Kingdom. The under lying idea of such a commission, however, is that the riparian States should have the major share in the composition of the commission^ A commission in which the majority would consist of foreigners departs entirely from the conditions envisaged by my Government. I may add that the suggestion which I understand was made by the Iranian representative that the commission should consist of the two members only with an appeal, when they disagreed, to the League, or its Transit Organisation, appears to me to be entirely impracticable for obvious reasons. far 5. There are a number of other points in the draft recommendation and the commentary as to which I would have criticisms to offer, but it seems premature to go into them before the two outstanding points mentioned above have been dealt with. Appendix H. Additional Comments on the Rapporteur’s Proposal. Article 3 and observation C appear to be based on a complete misunder standing of the Iraqi request. As was explained at the beginning o“ i un Pasha’s speech of the 14th January, 1935, to the Council, Appendix 011 P G described such violations of the boundary by official agents of the Iranian brovein lettered as had led up, in the ensuing correspondence, to specific denials or e ilfftWl v alidity of the frontier delimited in 1914; it was in no sense a statemen o^ i# ^ m imstrative problems arising out of the alignment of the boundary, nor was Council asked to take any specific action regarding the Gun] an am in Particular. The question of the utilisation of the waters of the numerous Lot# crossing the boundary and the movement of nomadic tribes constitute an administrative problem on a par with those presented by the question o ligation on the Shatt-el-Arab.

Proposal as discussed with Nuri Pasha was merely to give Persia an Moorage off Abadan on analogy of anchorage given her off Mohanmerah by 1913/14 Comission, who would undoubtedly have given her an anchorage off Abadan also had that port possessed anything approaching its present im~ portance at that period 9 2* Nuri Pasha when in London was warned of the im portance - which he fully realised - of this proposal being so worked out as not to risk depriving Iraq of full sovereign rights over the main navigable channel, and sug gestion then under discussion was that anchorage should only be of minimum width required for purpose for which it is intended, and not extend either to t halweg or to mid stream, 3* I have heard of no suggestion that new Persian anchorage should be in any way withdrawn from the control proposed Conservancy Board, which would presumably oxercise the same rights over it as it would exercise under the draft convention over the Persian anchorage off Mohammerah, so that question of dual control ought not to Present serious difficulty, particularly if matter is properly dealt with in Conservancy Board Convention,30 0' 2„ 4 , I see no objection to suggestion of lease, and. If this were coterminous with Conservancy Board Convention one difficulty of proposed frontier adjustment would cer tainly he overcome. But I consider that Iraqis would be ill advised to risk rupture on this point. 5. It would no doubt he useful if Colonel Ward could accompany Iraqi Ministers- to Tehran as suggested. Addressed to Bagdad No. 11 Saving; repeated to Tehran No. 11 Saving.,«„tc nnCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT Summary of the Developments in the Perso-Iraqi Frontier Question during the recent Session of the Council of the League of Nations, Geneva, May 16-25, IRAQ was represented at this session by Nnri Pasha, who was assisted by Mahomed Zaki, the Minister of Justice, Muzahim-al-Pachachi and Mr. C. J. Edmonds, with Mr. Fachiri as legal adviser. Persia was represented by M. Kazemi, assisted by M. Ala and M. Sepahbodi, Minister in Rome, and by de Lapradelle as legal adviser. The rapporteur was Baron Aloisi, the Italian representative on the Council, but he delegated his functions entirely to two of his subordinates, the Marchese di Soragna and Signor Scaduto. In the Secretariat, M. Lisicky (a Czech) of the Political Section had charge of the question under Mr. Walters, but Signor Pilotti took part in some of the opening conversations. Mr. Baggallay watched the question on behalf of the United Kingdom delegation. 2. Nuri Pasha and his colleagues and MM. Ala and Sepahbodi reached Geneva a few days before the opening of the session in order to confer with the rapporteur’s representatives. At an early stage of the discussions the Marchese di Soragna asked the Iraqi delegation for particulars of the cc 1932 proposals ” mentioned in Nuri Pasha’s letter of the 17th February to the rapporteur. Owing to an unexpected deficiency in Nuri Pasha’s instructions, he was unable to furnish particulars of the most important of these proposals, i.e., the Shatt-el- Arab Conservancy Board Convention, until two days later, when he had received authority from Bagdad. He then communicated orally an outline of this convention and of the proposed “ transferred territories ” oil-field and bon voisinage” agreements. He indicated that, although the Iraqi Government would admit of no foreign participation as such on the Conservancy Board, they recognised that a third vote was essential and added that Great Britain, as the Power which owned an overwhelming proportion of the shipping using the river, had in 1932 seemed the obvious choice to both the Iraqi and Persian Governments. 3. When M. Kazemi reached Geneva he gave the rapporteur a draft Conservancy Board Convention prepared by the Persian Government. No c&lt; ^py of this draft reached the United Kingdom or Iraqi delegations, but M. Ala showed it to Mr. Baggallay. It was in most respects an indifferent paraphrase of the draft communicated to the Persian Government in 1932, but provided for the representation of only two States, Iraq and Persia, with an appeal to the League of Nations in case of difference. (In this connexion M. Kazemi told Mr. Eden on another occasion that his Government would not, in fact, object to British representation if the point were pressed.) The seat of the board was to be alternately in Iraq and Persia. One article stated that the right of punishing “ delits de droit commun ” (as opposed to navigation offences) would lie with the State owning the bank nearest to the point at which the offence occurred. In other words, it assumed a median line frontier. 0 4. On the basis of these various suggestions the Marchese di boragna • . . i a r.. „ „ “ H o T»anr»m manna- communicated to the two parties on the 22nd May a “ pro jet de recommand ac tions.” This “ projet,” of which a copy is attached (Appendix I), recommended the acceptance of the greater part of the 1914 frontier by Persia m re f^ iri ° r a rectification which would provide her with an anchorage off Abadan; the settle ment of certain questions affecting the land frontier (though the oil-held was not mentioned); and the conclusion of a convention providing for a live- ower conservancy board, on which British representation would be indirectly secured, and for “ egalite de droit des deux riverains”—a phrase which might mean everything or nothing. The “ projet ” was accompanied by some observations (Appendix II) which do not merit special examination. PERSIA. May 29, 1935. confidential. Section 1, [E 3390/32/34] 1935. [415 ff-1] (!) April 15, Section 2. Blit' 1 5. This “ projet ” pleased neither side. The Persian delegation rejected it with indignation. The Iraqi delegation also rejected it, somewhat precipitately in a letter of the 23rd May, of which a copy is attached (Appendix III). But Nuri Pasha was subsequently persuaded that it was worth while trying to hold the rapporteur to a proposal which, in spite of many defects of detail, still needing rectification, upheld the one essential point of the Iraqi case, i.e., their insistence on the 1914 frontier, and he followed up his letter by telling the Marchese di Soragna orally that he felt sure that, if all other points were satisfactorily arranged, his Government would not allow the question of an anchorage off Abadan to stand in the way of a settlement. 6. In the face of this double rejection of his proposals, the rapporteur decided that he could do nothing but recommend to the Council that he should be given a further extension of time in which to find the basis of a settlement, and that the two parties should also employ this time in direct discussions. The Persian delegation were eager for an adjournment of this kind. The Iraqi delegation were clearly far too uncertain regarding the details of the practical settlement which their Government were prepared to offer to Persia to be able to face a discussion in the Council. In consequence, the rapporteur had little difficulty in obtaining the concurrence of both sides in the terms of a declaration to the Council on the lines he proposed. 7. The question came before the Council on the 25th May, and a copy of the proceedings is attached (Appendix IV). It had been arranged that there should be no discussion, but there was a moment of alarm when Tevfik Bu§tii Aras embarked upon an appeal to the parties to settle the question, as in the case of the Turco-Persian frontier, not on the basis of former treaties and protocols, but in a friendly and practical manner, and recalled the part that the Shah had played in the Turco-Persian settlement. This speech came as a complete surprise to Nuri Pasha, who was furious (as was the rapporteur), but he wisely said nothing. It also had the effect of making the Persian delegation uneasy, and may be said to have pleased nobody. 8. The future course of the negotiations is far from clear. The rapporteur himself is at present at a loss to know what to recommend, but will presumably feel obliged to produce some plan or other. So far as His Majesty’s Government and the Iraqi Government are concerned, the only immediate practical step seems to be to work out the terms of a practical settlement in greater detail than has yet been done, including, if possible, an arrangement whereby the Persian Govern ment can exercise some degree of jurisdiction on the Shatt-el-Arab in order to reduce smuggling—a matter to which the Iraqi Government have so far paid very scant attention.

Prime Minister argued that it was essential that Persia should be safeguarded from possible exercise of sovereign rights on the part of Iraq with the object of depriving Persia of free use of the river. I said that it seemed to me that if conservancy board were set up this would involve session or delegation of sovereignty for practical purposes by Iraq to conservancy board in which Persia would have equal rights with other members. Board would have complete administrative control. Prime Minister admitted this. 3, Impression left upon me was that (a) as regards land frontier, Persian government would ultimately be willing to abandon claim for alteration,, This is borne out by what has previously been said to nis by Kazemi and Scheily. As regards (b) safeguard suggested by Prime Minister constitutes ultima, ratio of their requirements. Persian government do not seem definitely to have abandoned hope of securing recognition of what they call their 'rights' as regards Shaft-el-Arab frontier tut I think they could ce induced to accept solution of conservancy board if agreement could include some clause whereby Iraq recognised practical difficulties and guaranteed tha during the life-time of conservancy board or of whatever agreement is arrived at between the two governments &gt; • 4 -’ U c * s»governments Persia should enjoy unoisturbe-d usoiruct “ f the entire Stett-el^Aralo waterway, (Some qualifica.- : 3 ;“ g « « neeesaary to ptovida to.p posoitmty of the two countries being engaged in hostilities on opposite sides though this point did not arise in conversation with Prime Minister) « If in addition Persia could he given the waterfront at Abadan as a.

There has never, so far as I am aware, been any question of Iraqis contemplating any surrender or delegation of sovereignty over Shatt-el-Arab except as regards proposed new Persian anchorage off Abadan. On the other hand, before agreement can be reached, Persian challenge to present frontier must in some way be disjjosed of. Logical course would be to refer juridical question, which Persians raised by challenging the validity of present frontier in international law, to a competent juridical tribunal, but there is no need a. or Iraqis to press this point if they can secure tacit but definite witn- drawal of Persian challenge in some less obtrusive way. Nuri f s present intention is to suggest that present frontiei be laid down afresh in new instrument, without reference to previous instruments or to proceedings of 1914 delimitation commission, but with modification required to give Persia pro posed anchorage off Abadan and with proper provision lor defining frontier at Hookah Channel and out to open sea. Pro posed modification at Abadan would justify and facilitate this procedure, and thus enable legal question to be put to sleep without formal admission or concession on either side. On the other hand pfConservancy Board Convention.can be con cluded question of sovereignty will lose its practical importance except possibly in time of war, and Persians will mi fact obtain equalequal voice with Iraqis in all practical questions connected with administration of Bliatt* This will dispose of all their practical grievances while acquisition of new anchorage at Abadan should go some way to satisfy a mour propre c Persians have full freedom of navigation over the Shatt under the existing instruments P and freedom of passage of all vessels is provided for under proposed Conservancy Convention.

THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compliments, and has the honour to transmit copy of a memorandum by Mr. Eden of a conversation with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs at Geneva on the 22nd May regarding the Perso-Iraqi frontier dispute. Geneva, May 22, 1935. Enclosure. Memorandum by Mr. Eden of a Conversation with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs at Geneva on May 22, 1935, regarding the. Perso-Iraqi Frontier Dispute. M. KAZEMI came to see me to-day to discuss the Perso-Iraqi frontier question. 2. He opened the conversation by stating that the position was unsatis factory. The question had made no progress since the last session. At that session he had accepted the principle of a joint conservancy board for the Shatt- el-Arab, and he had hoped to reach a settlement on that basis during the Rome discussions. Unfortunately the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs had left Rome and had not returned. On the present occasion the suggestion for a conservancy board had been renewed. The Iranian delegation were still prepared to accept this suggestion, and he had communicated to the rapporteur a draft convention of his own devising for the establishment of such a board. I would doubtless receive a copy of this draft in due course from the rapporteur, and would find that it provided for the participation of only two countries—Iraq and Iran. He wished, however, to assure me in strict confidence that if His Majesty s Government were really interested in the Shatt-el-Arab and desirous of being represented on the board, his Government would not, when it came to the point, offer any objection 3. I said that what M. Kazemi had told me was of considerable interest, but that I was not clear why it should have been necessary to prepare a new ai a when the draft communicated to the Iranian Government m 1932 was a re /L T inexistence. M. Kazemi said there had been two drafts under discussion in , , a tripartite draft and a bipartite draft. The new draft embodied many o e features of the tripartite 1932 draft, together with certain modifications designed to meet the developments that had occurred in the situation • He felt sure that when I saw it I would find it satisfactory. I observe a i n i never heard of the bilateral draft, but that I would be prepared to suspend final judgment upon his new draft until I had seen its text. . n 1 M. Kazemi then passed to what was evidently the main o jec o • The present dispute could never be settled, he declared, un ess is j T Government insisted upon the Iraqi Government adopting a reasona e _ He wished to assure me emphatically and categorically tha m see ung her rights in the Shatt-el-Arab, Iran was not actuated an y M • . &gt; Haq or Great Britain, or by any ulterior motive. Could not ® Government accept this assurance and persuade the Iraqi over QUott J had nothing to fear from admitting the rights of Iran over half the Shatt-el- Arab, the more so since such an admission would be accompan y P settlement (the conservancy board), which would render e ex frontier a matter of minor importance ? [415 aa—1]2 5. I made it clear to M. Kazemi that his proposal was out of the quest' The sovereignty of the Shatt-el-Arab was a juridical issue, which could onbta settled by a juridical decision. The Iraqi Government had offered to submit th^ issue to the Permanent Court, which existed for the settlement of just sub disputes as this. No country could be expected to do more. His Majestv’ Government, for their part, could not use their influence with the Iraqi Govern 8 ment to induce them to change the frontier in the absence of a juridical decision Even if they were to try to do so, the Iraqi Government, who had their own Parliament and public to consider, would be bound to refuse. I was well aware of the difficulties connected with the Iranian Constitution and with the Iranian reservation to the optional clause, which made the Iranian Government reluctant to submit this case to the Permanent Court. But speaking quite frankly it seemed to me that they must overcome these difficulties if they wanted a decision If the Iranian Government were being asked to surrender territory in their possession it would be quite comprehensible that they should refuse to submit such a question to judicial settlement. But the present case was the other way about. It was the Iranian Government who were the plaintiffs. It was they who were asking the Iraqi Government to give up territory in their possession. If the Iraqi Government were willing in such a situation to accept the jurisdiction of the Permanent Court, it was unreasonable for the Iranian Government to reject it. If they persisted in doing so, it seemed to me that the frontier must inevitably remain where it was. 6. M. Kazemi objected that in the view of his Government there was no question of Iraq giving Iran anything. What Iran claimed was Iran’s by right. I agreed that this was one way of looking at the question, but it did not alter the plain facts of the situation, which were that it was Iran who was asking for something and Iraq who was being asked to give up something. 7. I said all this so many times that M. Kazemi can hardly have failed to understand that he could hope for no help from His Majesty’s Government except in the direction of a practical solution, the advantages of which I urged him to consider. 8. Before leaving, M. Kazemi suggested that quicker progress might be made if he and the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs were to embark on direct discussions; the basis of these discussions would be that Iran would agree, subject to minor modifications, to redefine the existing land frontier (as in the case of her frontier agreement with Turkey), without making any mention of the 1913-14 agreements, while Iraq, in her turn, would agree to redefine the river frontier as following the middle of the stream. I said that this proposal seemed to me to beg the whole question of the Shatt-el-Arab; the Iraqi Government would never accept such a basis, and if the discussions were started without a basis at all, I saw no reason to think that they would proceed any more rapidly or successfully than discussions under the auspices of a ra'p'porteur.agitremeiiLs, wnne Iraq, m ner mrn, would agree to redefine the river frontier as following the middle of the stream.

My dear Rendel, The Admiralty have noted with some perturbation in the recent telegrams about the Shatt-el-Arab the suggestion that there should be some rectification of the frontier opposite Abadan. We infer from paragraph 14 of Baggallay’s report of his Geneva interview with Ala (Foreign Office letter E.3401/32/34 dated 12th Ju ne) that this suggestion was discussed during the Council Meeting, and that the proposal was to give Persia a 'thalweg” frontier in the neighbourhood of Abadan, and possibly also from there to the sea. Further more, although Baggallay states in his report that the Persians had definitely rejected this suggestion we note from your telegram No.158 to Baghdad that the proposal is still being investigated. The object of this letter is to let you know that from the Admiralty point of view a thalweg frontier opposite Abadan would be very nearly if not quite^as bad as a thalweg frontier all the way up the river. At the present time H.M. Ships oiling at Abadan remain within Iraqi waters whilst they are fuelling, whereas if the proposed arrangements were made they would be in Persian waters when they were alongside the wharves. To this extent / therefore / in time of war Persia’s neutrality would be more closely engaged than it is now; and the Persians would clearly be unable to argue that Iraq’s neutrality only was involved. Moreover, .it is too much to hope thatnavigable channel suitable for transports, etc. proceeding to Basrah would be left wholly within Iraqi waters. We trust therefore that you are not seriously intending to carry the proposal further. I am sending copies of this letter to Bir Ronald Adam, Laithwaite and Pirie. Yours sincerely. A.

This request, coupled with suggestion reported in third paragraph of my eele- gram No 0 156 and in my telegram No. 173, would seem to give us ample justification for playing an active though inconspicuous part in any negotiations which may take place here, i ^m. of course in close touch with Iraqi Legation also tnough I have c, suspicion that recently they have not been in close touch with who seems to have left them uninformed.

I feel strongly that legal decision unfavourable to Persia will do more harm than good in practice, I consider that if Iraqi Government are willing to follow that course, suggestion of coiservancy board, pooling of oil royalties, and bon voisinage agree- rant would be best solution, though I would mention that as stated in my telegram N o. 175 Kazemi appeared willing to abandon all claims on remainder of frontier in return for a favourable settlement of Shatt-el~Arab question and that there might be a possibility that Persian Government woul he content with rights over the river o^f Abadan - &gt;-&gt;60 my telegram No. 176, paragraph 3. 6.

It may also partly explain the Shah’s •* statement in your telegram No. 163 (of April 27th) that dispute was one ’’between two foreign Ministries'* If Kazemi is the villain of the piece might not aeet means of bringing about a satisfactory settlement now be try to short-circuit him by taking matter up direct with Shall? Repeated Persian appeals for good offices of His Majesty’s Government, and absence of Kazemi at Geneva, ^ght furnish opportunity; but I realise difficulties e ither of seeking audience of Shah for specific purpose of discussing such a question with him over the head of his dhisuers, or of raising such an important question in the COU^p.a A'f* c 01 an audience grant-ed for eorne other purpose.

Further, nothing must be done at this stage to prejudice the strong tactical position which iraq has secured by her expressed readiness to accept reference to decision of Permament Court of International Justice at The Hague* 3* But mere legal decision, however necessary it may have been made by Kasemi’s tactics, will not bring about a satisfactory solution* Best solution in the interests of both parties would be reversion to settlement provisionally accepted in 1932, on lines suggested to Nuri here last February (see my telegram No 068 (of February 1st) to Rome) aid put forward by him to hi a (see my telegrams NoSc 73 (of February 2nd) and 7S (of February 4th) to Rome). Kazemi may never have informed the Shah of this proposal 0 Possible line of approach to Shah might be as described in this and following 4 paragraphs:- When Iraqis m November last complained to League of Persian violations (4 frontier, Persian government replied by questioning validity in international law of .instruments on which the frontier was based, and 'book line that no violations had occurred since no legal frontier existed* Iraqis could not accept this contention,, which incidentally would have vitiated oiie of the premises on which Iraq cotainea Mission the League of Nations, ~ e* that she .

The main point to bring cut would, be that the solution proposed by Nuri, which was accepted in principle by the Shah as long ago as 1932, is stvll open, and would bring about a permanent and practical aontion of the problems on common sense lines which would far more to the interest of both States than a sterile decision as to the precise alignment of a political frontier flowed by continued ill-feeling and lack of co-operation* fou Question comes before the League Council at its BeBs i°n beginning on May 20th, and it is unlikely that such acMc fo even if you were able to give it, would affect the -Me u late situation; but the proceedings at Geneva may j c B 0nf &gt; Particularly in view of the complications arising from5.

THE Iranian Minister called on me to-day to take his leave before setting out for Geneva, where he will form part of the Iranian delegation for the purposes of the frontier dispute with Iraq, which is to come before the Council of the League at its session beginning on the 20th May. 2. M. Ala said that he understood that the rapporteur had now put forward a new suggestion, which was that the matter should be referred to the Legal Sub-Committee of the Transit Committee of the League. Had His Majesty’s Government any information or views on this subject? 3. I told M. Ala that His Majesty’s Government had, in fact, been informed of this suggestion through His Majesty’s Ambassador in Rome (see Sir Eric Drummond’s telegram No. 274 of the 3rd May), but that they did not know what the Iraqi Government would think of it. Without knowing more as to the reasons which had led Baron Alois! to abandon his original suggestion for three jurists and to substitute the present suggestion for it, it was difficult to express any opinion. I confessed, however, that I was somewhat at a loss to see how this suggestion was likely to help to bring about a satisfactory solution. The question at issue, as I understood it, was a purely juridical one, the Iranian Government having disputed the validity in international law of the instruments on which the present frontier was based. That being so, it seemed clear that what was needed was a juridical decision, and for this purpose it was obviously desirable that the question should be referred to the best possible international legal authority. It was difficult to see what would be gained by invoking the assistance of a somewhat obscure legal sub-committee of a committee of the League which had no concern with the plain juridical question in dispute. M. Ala replied that he knew nothing about the Transit Committee of the League and he agreed that it would be preferable to avoid further discussion o t is proposal until the rapporteur could develop it himself. I said that we wou , of course, gladlv hear anything Baron Alois! had to say when the time came. 4. The Minister then said that he wished to raise a further question. I he Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs had recently approached you on the question of a possible Anglo-Iranian settlement. The Iranian Governmen e a proper course was to try, in the first instance, to eliminate e , , difficulty, and M. Kazemi analysed these as follows : On the si e o J ./ Government there was the question of Bahrein and of t e posi 10 „ , rulers of the Persian Gulf; on the Iranian side there were the question of the Iranian claim to the Islands of Tamb and Abu Musa and ^ of Shatt-el-Arab. M. Kazemi had tentatively suggested to ^^/the Iranian all outstanding difficulties between His Majesty ® ^ over , n ^S • t eac p 0 th e r, Government could be reached if these matters could be se &amp; i T1( i eDen( j eIlce 0 f Iran and His Majesty’s Government agreeing to reco^ 1 ^the mdep^to ^1 Bahrein, and Iran recognising the special re a ions M - esty ’ s Majesty’s Government and the Arab rulers t e sovere i gnty over the Islands Government would recognise the Iranian claim ass i s t a nce over of Tamb and Abu Musa and give the Iranian ^ ve 'ftrr^ to M KazemEs the question of the Shatt-el-Arab. M. Ala was u vl ou y April What precisely did the Iranian Government mean w h en *he^ asked f° r assistance of His Majesty’s Government m their d yute with ^qi ^ ment over the Shatt-el-Arab? The question at ffis to be a legal one, and was at this moment before the Council of the League. [415 o—l]2 Maiesty’s Government had more than once made their position clear. In these circumstances, what was the assistance which the Iranian Government hoped to receive from us? „ „ . , , . 6 M Ala replied that, although Iraq was a fully independent State and a member of the League of Nations, His Majesty’s Government still occupied a very special position in regard to the new State. The long period during which they had held a mandatory position had given them a very special moral influence and the Iranian Government were convinced that the Iraqi Government would still be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government in any major question if it were sufficiently strongly expressed. Iran felt very strongly that the frontier claimed by Iraq in the Shatt-el-Arab was inequitable and anomalous. What Iran claimed was a frontier drawn in accordance with international practice running down the thalweg of the Shatt and giving her full sovereignty over half the water. This was the solution for the realisation of which the Iranian Government desired the good offices of His Majesty s Government. 7 I explained to M. Ala the difficulties of dealing with this question on any such basis, more especially now that Iran had disputed the legal validity of the existing frontier as a whole. But the main question was surely a purely practical one. It had always been recognised that the situation on this frontier involved a number of practical difficulties and that close co-operation between the two States was essential if these difficulties were to be overcome. With this object in view His Majesty’s Government, who were no less interested than Iraq and Iran in the proper maintenance of the Shatt waterway, had long sought to further a practical solution. Such a solution, I suggested, might well be found in a tripartite conservancy convention, such as that which had already formed the subject of discussion. Under such a convention Iran would obtain an equal voice with Iraq in the control of the waterway and would secure all the practical advantages which she could desire. I emphasised how important it was to overcome the practical difficulties of the situation quite irrespective of the question of the frontier-line itself, and I strongly urged on the Minister the desirability of his Government concentrating first and foremost on this aspect of the problem. 8. I pointed out to M. Ala that a solution on these lines had been put forward, largely at the instance of His Majesty’s Government, and had been provisionally accepted by Iran as early as 1932, that that offer had been revived and restated by Nuri Pasha in February 1935 and was still open. I emphasised the advantages of the three conventions comprised in this offer—the Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Convention, the Oil Royalties Pooling Agreement and the Bon-Voisinage Convention—and I repeated to him my conviction that it was on these lines that the true solution of the present difficulty was to be found. 9. M. Ala, while appearing to appreciate this point, said that the difficulty was that the Iraqi Government had made it a condition that any such negotiations could only take place on the basis of the 1914 line, the validity of which his Government could not accept. I hope that I may, nevertheless, have convinced him that it is only in this direction that the Iranian Government can hope to obtain the practical support of His Majesty’s Government in this dispute. 10.

NURI PASHA called upon me with Mr. Edmonds on the evening of the 2 nd April, and told me that he had received, through the Italian Legation, a message from Baron Aloisi to the effect that he could make no progress with the preparation of his report concerning the Iraq-Iran frontier dispute, unless Nuri Pasha himself returned to Rome or sent, in his place, some person authorised to discuss all aspects of the question on behalf of the Iraqi Government. A copy of this communication, as well as a copy of the message from Nuri Pasha to Baron Aloisi, to which it refers, is enclosed herein. 2. Nuri Pasha asked for my advice as to what reply he should make to Baron Aloisi, and, after some discussion, it was agreed that the best course would be to explain that the internal situation in Iraq made it impossible for him to leave the country, and that he was therefore obliged to ask Baron Aloisi to agree to defer further discussion until the May meeting of the Council of the League of Nations.

Enclosure 3 in No. 1 . Nuri Pasha to M. Porta. Dear Signor Porta, April 3, 1935. WITH reference to our conversation of to-day, it may be of assistance if I put briefly on paper the gist of what I tried to convey to you. I am somewhat puzzled by the tone of the messages being received from Rome, which seem to indicate a feeling on the part of the rapporteur that the Iraqi side is to blame for the lack of progress towards settling the Iraqi -Iranian boundary question. I think we can confidently claim that the contrary is the fact. It is we who are anxious to see an end put to Iranian aggression and appealed to the League for this purpose; we have put all our cards on the table, we have pressed for expeditious treatment of the dispute and intimated officiallyto the rapporteur, in order of preference, the methods of procedure which we would accept or in which we would acquiesce. Iran, on the other hand, has blocked every proposal, and, as far as we are aware, made no counter-proposals for consideration. I held myself at the rapporteur’s disposal for several days at Geneva and a fortnight at Rome; but no real progress was made. I need not dwell again on the reasons which obliged me to leave Rome when I did and have rendered my return impossible. You know them as well as I do, and have doubtless reported them fully to Baron Alois!. Even if circumstances had allowed of my returning to Rome in February, however, it is difficult to see how further authoritative discussion would have been possible in the absence of the Iranian Foreign Minister, who had also returned to his country. We hope that the internal situation in Iraq will have improved sufficiently for me to visit Geneva for the May meeting of the Council; and I should be grateful if Baron Alois! would endeavour to ensure that the Iranian Foreign Minister shall also attend in person and so make possible a resumption of our conversations there, perhaps two or three days before the session opens. In the meantime I feel that a continuation of the discussions through the channels already suggested might have valuable results. In particular, would you be so kind as to ask Baron Aloisi if his consultations with the Iranian side on my letter of the 17th February, 1935, have yielded any result, and if he is yet in a position to send me the answer promised in his letter of the 23rd Februarv ?tHI «! nOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Q&amp; HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT ^ jk Z. 1 ~ 3^49 April 15, 1935.

My dear Van, You prooably have had neither the time nor the inclination to follow the details of the Persian-Iraqi dispute, but I cannot help unburdening myself somewhat to you on the difficult position in which I find myself with regard to it. It is primarily a dispute between Iraq and Persia, was regarded as such at deneva, and indeed my original instructions were that, while I should do all I could to help Bari, I was not to commit myself definitely on the Iraii side. 2?his seemed to me admirable if I may say so, because the matter is before the Council and our invariable line has been on such occasions to explain to those wno sought our help that the matter being sub judice and we being one of the pudges, we must reserve our sentence till the proper occasion, i.e. at the Council table. Owing to the more recent instructions I have received, I have emphasised to Aloisi the strength of the Iraqi ease and the reasonableness of Burl in the negotiations. So far so good, and I think I have got away with it more or less successfully. hut there comes a point when insistence is likely to be dangerous, and I fear it is almost reached. Phe last telegram, Bo.91, sent to me might well indicate that our real object is to try to get the 1932 scheme, whereby we get officially a standing in the administration of the Shatt-ei-Arab, accepted during the negotiations which are now/ r Hobert Vansittart, Gr.C.M.G. , A.C.B. , M.V.C. , foreign Office./I p », lf „ 0[p0rtanlty to ..ptoPi.. t.

W6 Seem t0 ^ UP aSajJ1Bt ail as regards the 19 g2 plan . ihe reasons which inspire them are probably utterly different though unhappily they lead to the same conclusion. fhe first is anxious to get Italy in somehow - hence his proposal for a Commission of five members. 'fhe second would like to see the river internationalised in some way. The Persians do not lime a definite extension of our authority in that part of the ivorld. They therefore none of them want the 1932 . scheme. Aloisi says, if Great Britain why not Italy? Of course he knows of our predominant interests, but that knowledge will not change his view. The Secretariat says, why Great Britain alone? Everyone is interested, or may become so, in the Shatt-el-Arab navigation. The Persians: M ';7e do not want Great Britain in at all'. I fear this united opposition is invincible (unless we buy off the Italians by concessions elsewhere - I wish I nadn f t had to write this}* I hope I may assume we shall not even consider this; and even if we did there is still Persia. frankly, your telegram Bo.91 has made me a little unhappy, since it seems to imply that I have not understood the strength of the Iraqi case or the evils of Aloisi*s attitude. But I have, and have pointed them out vigorously. All the same, it is useless to refuse to face up to the present position, vihich is as I have described, and I feel that we should be careful not to put ourselves in a position vis-a-vis the Council in which it might be put about/about that we blocked a settlement, because we wanted to get something out of it ourselves. I know how touchy Geneva is on such a matter, and I feel that we should walk very warily* This does not mean that I will not take any good opportunity again to set out our point of vie?/, but X snould like, bearing in mind the Geneva aspect, to be given a considerable amount of discretion. I hope that you will not think that I am complaining or am unduly sensitive. The difficulties arise from our position as advisers to Eiuri, as interested parties, and as a member of the Council exercising quasi judicial functions. All this makes it very complicated. 1 Yours ever, (Sgd) Eric Drummond.1935 foreign OFFICE, S.?.l. 21st February, 1935 . My dear Eric. Many thanks for your personal letter of 12th February about the Perso-Iraqi frontier dispute. I was very glaa to have your views, and I well understand the difficult position in which you must have found yourself over this question. 2. Since your letter was written you have had our telegrams Nos. S7 and 100 of 13th February, to which you have replied in your telegrams Nos. 100 and 101 of 14th February, so that (some of the points in your letter will already have been cleared up. But I think it may perhaps still be useful if I give you a brief account of how we see the situation from this end. 3. Iraq inherited a frontier with Persia which had not in fact until quite recently ever been seriously questioned, and which was accepted by all the States Members of the League as a fixed and stable frontier when Iraq was admitted to membership of the League in the autumn of 1932. The Persians, since the establishment of the new regime in Persia, have decided - for reasons which I do not want to question at this moment - that they do not like this frontier and have been exercising various forms of pressure on Iraq with a view to getting certain parts of it changed. Conversations were still going on between the Iraqis and the Persians, and we were doing what we could to further an amicable settlement, when,the Persians took the law into their Right Honourable Sir Eric Drummond, G.C.M.G-. , C.B.their own hands, established a number of police nosts well on the Iraqi side of the frontier, (their position is not disputed) and instructed their warships to disregard the Iraqi navigational regulations in the Iraqi waters of the Shatt-el—Arab. When tne Iraqis protested against these violations of the frontier, the Persians replied by saying that they aid not admit that trie frontier existed at all, since, in their view, the instruments on which it was based were legally invalid. The position thus created was a very serious one ior Iraq, and Iraq decided on her own initiative to appeal to the League under Article 11 of the Covenant against what she regarded as indisputable acts of Persian aggression on her territory. The Persian reply was that the territory was not Iraqi, since the frontier was legally invalid. It is hard to see how, on this statement of the case anybody could hesitate to regard the main question at issue as the purely juridical one of the validity or otherwise of the existing frontier. 4. At this point the Italians, who already had as much work to do at Geneva as they could possibly deal with, took the initiative in securing for themselves t he position of rapporteur in this dispute. They came to the Iraqis, practically hat in hand, and begged that they might be accepted in this capacity. The Iraqis, although suspicious of their action and doubtful as to wnere it might lead, were gradually forced by Persian tactics into a position where they could only avoid an Italian rapporteur by directly objecting to him. This it would have been most difficult and invidious for either them or us to do on the evidence available at the time. 5. Prom that moment there has hardly been even the semblance of giving the Iraqis a square deal. i'he Italians began1 tegan Dy concentratii^ almost entirely on the question of the Italo-lraqi Treaty of Friendship. Not only is this entirely irrelevant to the present issue, but it is clear that it could only confuse and prejudice the position. Even though the Treaty itself was admittedly quite anodyne and harmless, it became obvious that the 1talians attached great bargaining importance to it. blether this was for the ir own purposes as a means of increasing their prestige in the Middle East or for the purpose of squeezing the Persians in some other way is not quite clear, but it is hardly possible not to suspect them of some ulterior motive. o. But what has been even worse has been that, apart from Aloisi 1 s proposal that he should obtain the advice of three jurists on the legal question involved - a proposal which Nuri has made no difficulty about accepting, on obviously reasonable conditions Aloisi has taken up the Question on lines which really have absolutely nothing to do with the issue in dispute. He seems to have got right away from the question of Persian aggression,, about which the Iraqis went to the League* and from that of the legal validity of the frontier, which the Persians themselves raised in their defence, and to be concentrating entirely on securing for Persia new and extensive rights in what is in fact Iraqi territory - in fact in getting certain special advantages and privileges for Persia at the expense of Iraq in advance of any settlement. He says that Persia is entitled to her present rights under certain instruments; but tnose rights have never been disputed, and in any case the instruments are the very instruments whose validity Persia is challenging; while the rights in question were in fact only given to Persia by those instruments as a kind of compensation for the far more extensive territorial rights whichwhich- 'fch© same ins’tpuinen'fcs gave j_paQ_. and. which Aloisi refuses to recognise as creating even a purely de facto situation. 7 . We were at first a little puzzled to know why Aloisi had so completely turned away from the real issue and given such prominence to an issue which did not arise either under the appeal or the defence. But I fear there is no doubt that his only object is to secure a position of authority and prestige at the nead of the Gulf for his o?/n country.. What he is running- is in fact a purely Italian stunt and has nothing to do with the issue before the Council, while there seems no doubt at all that the Italians are extracting terms from the Persians for their trouble.’ Unfortunately in bringing up this new issue Aloisi has come up against our own vitally important British interest in the Shatt, which we hold, not only in virtue of our Treaty of Alliance with Iraq and for reasons of Imperial strategy, but on the extremely strong ground of the immense predominance {9'3%) of British shipping among the shipping using the waterway 8 . You will see from this that we have not really, as you implied in your letter, changed our ground. While the issue was the Perso-Iraqi dispute which had come up before the Council, it was natural and proper that we should maintain an attitude of official neutrality. But the new issue which Aloisi has raised, and which is so clearly directed at substituting Italy for Great Britain in the administration of the extremely complicated waterway of tne Shatt-el-Arab, is one in which we cannot remain indifferent, and Aloisi’s tactics have therefore forced us to oppose him openly. 9 . I hone this explanation will make our position clear. The Italian handling of the whole aij air has,BKHBJOHnBHH ' of course been quite deplorable, and showed the Italian Government at their very worst. I can only hope that when the dispute is taken back to Geneva some means may be found of putting an end to these extremely unsavoury Italian intrigues and of getting the dispute back on to a proper basis (Sd.) R.VANSITTAR T.J c g. E 1X67/32/34) Wt UNITED KINGDOM DELEGATION TO THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS, GENEVA. 14th February, 1935. My dear George, I spoke to Avenol today about the way things are going at Rome in the matter of the Iraqi-Persian dispute. The best way to explain the situation to him seemed to be to show him In confidence Drummond’s telegram No. 89 of the 9th February, and our reply No. 91 of the 11th February; and this I did. He still takes what is to me, aid would be to you, an irritatingly 'impartial” view, even if it does not amount to incomprehension of the Iraqi case. As regards Drummond’s references to the part played by the League Secretariat at Rome, Avenol did not demur to Drummond’s statement (in paragraph 3 of his telegram) that the rapporteur, assisted If n ot I ndeed Inspired by the Secretariat, uakes the view that in addition to the juridical issue there is also the question of Persia's participation in the administration of trie Shatt. Indeed he indicated that he also takes this view. He seems to consider that the immediate (because practical) problem to be solved is that of getting the navigation on/ G.W. Rendel, Esq., C.M.G.,on the Shatt properly regulated by agreement as soon as possible, and he thinks it possible that both sides are raising the juridical issue (which he thinks is rather academic than substantial) as a matter of tactics. On the other hand, he said that brummond was quite wrong (para. 6) in supposing that the Secretariat favoured a system of internationalisation or that they did not admit any claim by His Majesty's Government to a special position. On the contrary, he has no doubt that tripartite administration is the only just solution. I said that the line adopted by the Secretariat was causing serious misgiving in London, and that this was all the more regrettable in that it provided ammunition for those who were only too ready to throw stones at the League. Avenol sal d that the root of the matter was that there was no way of bringing the Persians to the Hague against their will, and that unless one side or the other, or both, receded from their present position no solution was possible under Article II. What he thought would probably happen - and failing direct agreement this would perhaps oe tbe best thing - would be that the present negotiations would drag on for two or three months and then the Iraqis would invoke Article 15, which did at least lay down a definite procedure.

The attached memorandum by Mr. Edmonds, the Second Adviser in the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior, who accompanied the Iraqi delegation to Geneva and Rome, is worth submission for the light which it throws behind the scenes at Geneva. In ^ particular it explains how the Italian ^ representative came to be appointed rapporteur, which we have previously found rather difficult to understand. It appears that the Iraqi delegation intimated that they would prefer as rapporteur/■ — ps m ' '— '■ rapporteur the representative of some State not even remotely connected with the issue, Denmark, Chile, Portugal, Argentina, or Poland, but that the Persians objected to all these, intimating, however, that they would accept Italy. Unlike the Persians, the Iraqi representative hesitated to object to any proposal without serious reason, so that Baron Aloisi (who had previously informed Nuri Pasha that he had received clear orders from Rome to help Iraq) secured the rapport eurship. M. Litvinov, who had previously promised the Persians (as we know from unofficial information) to support them in any eventuality, promised the Iraqis not to take sides and appears to have kept this second promise.

Edmonds, Second Adviser in the Iraqi Ministry^ of the Interior and unofficial Adviser in the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Received in Foreign Office, February 23.) (Owing to the circumstances I was unable to keep a day-to-day diary of events at Geneva. I believe the following narrative is, however, substantially correct.) I REACHED Geneva on the 8th January. Nuri Pasha had already arrived. Ali Jawdat Bey also arrived on the 8th. M. Fachiri arrived on the 10th. the session of the Council opened on the 11th January. 2. We sent to the Secretary-General on the 12th January the relevant maps, with a short explanatory note, and on the 14th January documents relative t- 0 ^ e Port of Basra, including the Administration Report for 1933-34 (circulated under League Nos. C.40.M.17 and C.46.M.20 respectively). 3. In the course of his interviews with the various representatives on me Council Nuri Pasha found Sr. Madariaga and Baron Aloisi (who mtimated mat Italy would like to be on any Committee of Three of the Council that might be appointed) particularly interested. A short summary ol the case was prepared and handed to them on the 12th January (Appendix ). T i 4. During his visit to Angora Nuri Pasha had obtame roin promise not to take sides.

The Italian rapporteur, who was busy with the Saar and Abvssinia made no sign of life until the evening of the 16th January, when he invited N H Pasha to visit him at 6 p.m. Nuri Pasha left with him an aide-memoire pressin” for early steps for setting machinery in motion to obtain a final solution and f the maintenance of the 1914 line in the meantime (Appendix C). 11. The rapporteur gave no sign of life again on the 17th. On the 18th it was learned that he was not even proposing to get the matter put on the agenda of the Council, which was expected to terminate its session the following dav Saturday, the 19th, but wished the parties to accompany him to Rome Effort were made to secure more expeditious treatment of the question. h 12. At 8 p.m on the 18th January Mr. Walters asked me to call at his house and showed me a draft report and resolution (Appendix D) 13. On the morning of the 19th January, I accompanied Nuri Pasha to see the rapporteur; we were received by Signor Biancheri. Nuri Pasha was prepared with a short aide-memoire explaining his objections to the Secretariat draft ( ppendix E) and a counter-draft (Appendix F). Without waiting to look at these, Signor Biancheri stated that the Persians had written in objecting violently I j° ^ ec f e ^ aria t draft, which he affected to believe was an Iraqi draft or one | iaw n up m concurrence with the Iraqi side. He then produced a draft (which ‘ subsequently proved to be the Persian draft), said that it was time to leave for the I ,u, “ h ”'“ 14.

Brief Resume of the Turco-Rersian Frontier Question. (Communicated to MM. Aloisi and Madariaga on January 12, 1935 Persia and Turkey were in an almost chronic state of war from the 16th to the early 19th century. The first recorded treaty between them, tong frontiers, was signed in 1639. The boundaries there defined were rea ime further treaties, concluded after renewed wars, in 1746 and 1327.

The Persian possession of tbl left bank is thus an anomaly first validated by the Treaty of 1847 which Persia now affects to consider invalid.

The Iraqi case is that the treaty which was duly signed and ratified is perfectly valid. Various endeavours were made over a long period to delimit the frontier on the spot in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Erzerum but finality in this respect was not reached until 1914. Throughout the interveniim period there were difficulties and incidents with regard to the frontier, but Persia itself was constantly appealing to the Treaty of Erzerum as establishing what the frontier was. Finally, in 1913, the Protocol of Constantinople was concluded between Great Britain, Persia, Russia and Turkey. This described the frontier line in detail, on the basis of the Treaty of Erzerum, and appointed a commission to go out and delimit the boundary on the spot. The commission did so and had completed its work by October 1914, marking the line with posts and on large - scale maps. This is the frontier Iraq wants to see respected. The Persian Government say that the Protocol of Constantinople was null and void because it was not submitted to the approval of the National Assembly (Majlis), the Persian Constitution requiring parliamentary approval for changes in the State’s boundaries. The answer of Iraq is&lt;— (1) That the protocol did not alter the frontier as laid down by the Treaty of Erzerum. (2) That the Majlis was in abeyance at the time the protocol was concluded. (3) That, in any event, according to international law a State is bound by a regular international agreement concluded by the Executive without reservation or conditions. Appendix C. A ide-memoire.

The situation created by the refusal of Persia to recognise and respect he delimited frontier contains dangerous possibilities. The Iraqi Governmen s therefore anxious that steps shall be taken urgently— (a) To put machinery in motion with a view to obtaining a final solution (h) To prevent the continuation or aggravation of the dangerous si ua ion on the spot. 2.

(Nury Pasha Said (representative of Iraq), and Mirza Seyed Bagher Khan Kazemi (representative of Persia) came to the Council table.) M. Biancheri (rapporteur): I have not failed to get into touch with the parties, and I have received all useful information on the question. In order, however, to submit a report on the problem as a whole, which presents many aspects, I still need to continue my enquiries upon several points of detail and to discuss matters with the parties. In agreement with the parties, therefore, I propose that the Council should give me an opportunity to continue my studies in the interval between its present session and the next. Should there be an extra ordinary session of the Council before the May session, and should the negotiations have made sufficient progress to allow me to present my report I hope that the Council will authorise me to request the Secretary-General to place this item on the agenda. Nury Pasha Said (representative of Iraq) : I wish to the rapporteur fen the attention he has devoted to this case and for the trouble he has taken. Un behalf of my Government, I am bound to say, however, that we gi^a y regre i a it has not been possible to make more progress, at the present session of the Council, towards a settlement of the dispute, or even to deal provisiona y wi situation pending such a settlement. , , , 1V r As pointed out in the Iraqi request and in my speech last Monday, position at present is that the Persian Government ec mes ° S boundary which was delimited and demarcated m 1914 by an .. 1 lyyf 1 °^, c , f» » -Wch Persia *“ “toS SjSik observed for nearly twenty years, m the « the League of Nations two countries; it is, moreover, the boundary recqg y &lt; Assembiv itself in October 1932 on the occasion of the admission &lt; q, tHrd of the questions covering the conditmns of ehgibil J ^ ,, the committee re p 0rt ed : country possess a stable Government «jid^.ec 1 -t. af £ mative It ig t ‘ ue that To the third question the committee replies [315 bb—1]m Ins speech of welcome, which we much appreciated, the Persian renresentaHva referred to certain frontier questions which he hoped to settle; bulf that is of course, entirely different from Persia’s present attitude, which is that there is no *i P a p ™” &lt;«• - “»* that Iraq appealer! to the^ouncii^w'e ^ hm Tie^^ngh' ‘of attemp to prove that the boundary is invalid under international law but h seems elementary as a matter of principle, that a State cannot, merely because disputes the validity of a frontier and before the dispute has been decided take the law into its own hands and try to alter the boundary by unilateral actsofthe vind complained ot.

The arguments which have been presented to the Council are complicated, and it is clearly right that time should be given for the rapporteur to examine them as he has so kindly undertaken to do, thus adding one more to the heavy duties which rest on the representative of Italy, in collaboration with the parties, before making recommendations. All I wish to say at present is that the friendly feelings entertained by His Majesty’s Government towards both parties leads it to desire a just settlement of the whole dispute with the least possible delay. This I am sure is equally the desire of all my colleagues. The question of time is, however, important. The question before the Council is a legal one relating to the validity of certain documents, but it takes the form of an appeal by one country which claims that its neighbour has ignored an established frontier and taken unilateral action to enforce her own view of the international instruments on which that frontier is based. The situation is thus a delicate one, and I think I shall be interpreting the feelings of my colleagues in appealing to both sides to avoid any action which may hinder the task of the Council and render more difficult that final settlement of the question at issue which we all desire. M. Biancheri: I can assure the Council that I shall push on the negotiations very actively, taking into account the statements just made by the parties and the remarks presented by Mr. Eden. M. Rivas-Vicuna: I concur in what the United Kingdom representative has said, but I should like to raise a point of order. During this session we have had before us several requests for the application of article 11, paragraph 2, of the Covenant. I imagine that in each case when the Council desires to enter upon a discussion of the matter with a view to opening conciliation procedure, that amounts to saying that article 11, paragraph 2, is applicable to the request. Therefore, when the Council holds that in a particular case that article is not applicable, it must say so explicitly. At the time of opening the conciliation procedure, the Council must, in my opinion, therefore, consider the question and state that article 11, paragraph 2, applies to the request before it. The President: As Turkish representative, I have already indicated my opinion on the question, when I concurred in what M. Litvinov had sai . hesitated to go into the substance of the case, and I was anxious to preserve that attitude pending the conclusion of a successful arrangement e ween e wo parties concerned. The Turkish representative has of course^ his own opinion upon the validity or invalidity of the documents submitted. But I do not w^ sh to take up that point to-day. because I hope that an arrangement wdl be arrived at. I should indeed have been extremely glad if we could h ave reached a solution during the present very successful session, but I realise e 1 invariably i .hi, p pomi, 1w, u , o. zsz K “s s sra it is rabll to achS result as speedily as possible m order to preserve good MderstandinAetween two neighbouring States.

Hererting to the dispute itself, signor Pilotti told *3© that the Persians were cpite satisfied with the present arrangements for the navigation of the ■.:hatt«el-/rab # but their feared that if it was left as it was to-day? the Iraqi authorities might at any moment change that arrangement, which in fact depended wholly on them.

Signor Pilotti offered the explanation that reference to the Hague .Arbitral Court was provided by the Treaty of Tehran, the validity of which was acknowledge by the .Persians* He had spoken to the Persian Minister here on this subject and the Minister had at first expressed the view that that treaty had been revised and was no longer in fordo, but the rapporteur believed that if he Insisted,/insisted, the ersiaas would give way ^ the polat&lt; Pilotti, however, did not think it would he desirable that a ueh a reference should he mad* inmadiately. it Bight, be wise to make It by stages, and he suggested that perhaps the first stage should be either the Committee of Jurists about which he had already spoken or a reference to the Legal committee of the Transit Coaaiaaion, a body on which there were first-class lawyers. The latter could of course only give an advisory opinion to the Council. 6* l maintained the view that to w? way of thinking the dispute really was of a different character. ?he frontiers of Iraq had been acknowledge by the League when Iraq became a iaemb@r t and the accusation was that the Persians had violated those frontiers.

Iraqi-Persian Boundary Dispute. Narrative of Discussions at Rome between Ba,ron Aloisi and the Persian and Iraqi Ministers for Foreign Affairs. (Communicated by Mr. C. J. Edmonds, Second Adviser to the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior and unofficial Adviser to the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs; Received in Foreign Office, February 14.) IT was agreed at Geneva with the Persian representative that discussions should begin at Rome on Monday the 28th January. Nuri Pasha accordingly reached Rome on Friday the 25th or Saturday the 26th. I arrived on Sunday the 27th. The Persians, however, did not keep the tryst and only arrived on the evening of Wednesday the 30th. t n . . , , . 2. Nuri Pasha had a first interview with Baron Aloisi, the rapporteur, who * was accompanied by Signor Guarnaschelli, on Monday the 28th He found them more anxious to press for the immediate signature of the Italian treaty ot friendship than to discuss the Persian boundary. He learned however, that the Persians were adamant in their refusal to go to The Hague that the rapporteur was contemplating asking for a committee of three jurists to asslst hl ™ 1 preparing his report, and that he wished, before anything else, to elaborate a temporary arrangement regarding the Shatt-al-Arab. 3. On the 29th January Muzahim Bey found the Italians pressing h the treaty. Nuri Pasha understood from Baron Aloisi that, if e^her °f ^he pa _ * felt unable to accept the draft prepared by him with the help of th ^ / he as rapporteur would have no alternative but to lecomme Hag r On the 30th January, having heard that his eon ^“fthe operation, Nuri Pasha left for London.

On the 6th February, morning, Nuri saw Signor Biancheri, explained his objections to opening negotiations on a far-reaching ‘ c temporary ’’ arrangement before the procedure for ensuring a definite solution of the substantive problem and left with him an “aide-memoire personnel.” (Appendix B.) F 10. At the same meeting Signor Biancheri handed to Nuri Pasha a note (probably prepared by the Secretariat) which quoted the extract from the proceedings of the third sitting of the Delimitation Commission containing the description of the boundary where it leaves low-water line for the medium mum filum to give Persia the Mohammerah anchorage, and which pointed out that the navigable channel here appeared to pass through Persian waters. (Appendix C 1 &lt;• 11 T , Nm ‘ i Pasha did not immediately recognise the extract and promised Signor Biancheri to look into the matter. On his return he wrote a private note to bignor Biancheri pointing out that the passage quoted referred to the Mohammerah anchorage and suggesting that the consideration of the particular rights of either party under the Proceedings of 1914 would best be considered when the validity of the proceedings had been admitted by all concerned (Appendix D.)

Nuri Pasha in consequence visited Baron Aioisi at midday on the 7th February to inform him of this development and handed him a letter, expressing a hope that his enforced departure would not delay progress since he accepted either of the proposals hitherto made for the definitive solution, but repeating bis objections to any formal temporary arrangement that went beyond what was necessary to prevent a deterioration of the local situation.

Yours sincerely, NUBI SAID. Appendix E. Nuri Pasha to Baron Aloisi. ^ ir ’ . Rome, February 7, 1935. 1 have the honour to inform you that I have this morning received from my Government instructions to proceed immediately to Bagdad. While I much regret that reasons should have arisen making my return, after an already unexpectedly prolonged absence, imperative, and that it should not have been possible for me to remain in Borne until a decision should have been taken regarding the procedure to be followed in order to settle definitely the dispute between Iraq and Persia, I trust that in actual fact my departure will not in any way impede progress. I have already informed you that my Government would agree to the only two proposals that have been made regarding the procedure to be followed: willingly, to the proposal that the Council should at once refer the question in dispute to the Permanent Court of International Justice for an advisory opinion; reluctantly, because it is likely to prolong the proceedings unnecessarily, to the proposal that the Council should be asked in the first place to approve the appointment of three judicial experts to assist the rapporteur in preparing his report, this first step to be followed by a reference to the Permanent Court if either of the parties find itself unable to accept the report so drafted. As regards the comparatively short period which must elapse between the present date and the final settlement, the attitude of my Government has been made equally clear. The only formal agreement to which my Government could adhere would be one whereby both parties agreed to respect in its entirety the existing delimited boundary. The Persian representative has pleaded that such an arrangement would amount to creating a presumption prejudicial to Persia, but, as I endeavoured to point out in my last speech to the Council on the 21st January, it is the only arrangement which would be consistent with the most elementary principle without which all international relations would become impossible. Agreement to any other arrangement would be tantamount to condoning the violation of this principle and prejudging the issue to the prejudice of Iraq. I quite appreciate the reasons for which you felt unable at the time of the presentation of your report of the 21st January to recommend an agreement to respect the delimited boundary; but now that you have had the time to study all the aspects of the question, and that I have had the opportunity of discussing frankly with you, both from the point of view of principle and also on their intrinsic merits, various other proposals that have been tentatively put forward, I would ask you to consider whether the time has not come to recommend both parties to observe 'the delimited boundary pending the solution of the dispute regarding its legal validity. If you still think that the time has not yet come for such a recommendation, then, in view of the undertakings given by myself and the Persian representative on the 21st January, the only matter of great urgency, as far as can be at presentforeseen, is that steps should be taken to prevent accidents in the Shatt-el-Arab * this can best be done by means of an informal provisional arrangement between the chief navigation authorities of the two parties whereby His Persian Majesty’s ships shall be accorded the maximum of facilities consistent with the laws and regulations of the port of Basra in respect of pilotage and other matters, while these ships shall for their part observe the rule of the road and ^ nfhpr rpcmlat.mns Inirl Hnwn tn Ar»cmr‘P ttio cafAHr noTri+ l-a sold wo other regulations laid down to ensure the safety of navigation. I trust that it will be possible for myself or other representative of my Government to re-establish personal contact with you before the next session of the Council, whether extraordinary or ordinary. In the meantime, I request you to be good enough to transmit any necessary communications through the Italian diplomatic representative in Bagdad. I take this opportunity of tendering you my warmest thanks for your unfailing courtesy and for the close attention you have given to the important matter which my Government has felt obliged^ to refer to the Council of the League of Nations. I have, &amp;c. NURI SAID, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Royal Government of Iraq Appendix F. Note of a Conversation between Mr. Edmonds and Signor Pilotti. I saw Signor Pilotti at the League of Nations office this morning. I explained that i had asked to see him partly because we had hitherto not established contact with the Secretariat in the unaccustomed atmosphere of Rome and partly because I understood that the rapporteur was feeling that the Iraqi lepiesentatfve was being unduly intransigent and I thought that a connected exposition of the Iraqi view would be of help. 2. lor the definite solution of the quarrel three proposals had, as I under stood, been put forward :— tuthorib ;al(but ■e( andt which _ i, tat it * Lie Iraq t jjs regards I jits readiness Lothe draft Liii the prei Lgtothefii [relations, anc stittecause i accept in tl .. to negotiate Ifilotti's ass iposed w ilc icorporat Ire 'solution i (a) An immediate reference to The Hague. {b) A request to the Council to sanction the selection of three judicial experts to assist the rapporteur in preparing his report, it being understood that if either party felt it could not accept the report, there would be a reference to The Hague. (r) A request as above, without mention of what was to follow in the event of a refusal by either of the parties to accept the resulting report. I [ aq alread y accepted the first at Geneva and the second at Rome and, hough it was most unpalatable for reasons that I would explain presently, would not push to the last ditch its objections to the third. Persia, which had based its case at Geneva on the most elaborate legal arguments, had refused the first, had let used the second and, for reasons on which I would comment in a moment, had accepted the third. 3. As regards temporary arrangements, the debate at Geneva had been conhned to the narrow margin between the Iraqi thesis that the 1914 line should be respected until proved invalid and the Persian thesis that the “existing situation should be preserved. The rapporteur's proposal for revolutionary C p a f^ es ( -T n tbe ultimate authority that would control conservancy and navigation o e ohatt-el-Arab went far beyond the limits within which any temporary arrangements should be sought. 4. _ Returning to the proposal for a definite solution, the attitude of Iraq was pnmarily based on the following considerations: The boundary between ui my an eisia was fixed in 1914, as everyone believed, permanently, after seventy years (to go back no further) of war, rumours of wars, and diplomatic a ivi y 1 u ^ e c anceries of four Powers. Persia had now reopened the question again and Iraq was bent on having it settled once and for all. By this criterion 7 irr™ic^u 0 ^ 0Sa ^ )e 'i ud S ed - 0^ three proposals referred to, the first promised a speedy, the second a slower, but certain, solution. Iraq disliked the A definite sol : I said that pi had said iior fantasti | Signor Pik rig what they sires they hat jp) The Hague S provoke an e 1 Isaidpai opinion: feet, convi A®ly deeisie 1, ha .^render on I 1 , Signori F^iais miff iV was fe. hut l 'me prc Judic questiom ! bank. 7 H to th&lt; ^ in due ffee sugge* ^ite win L ^fenei ^ to the ' r uarymm/ mlk third for the very reason that Persia was willing to accept it, namely that Persia could still block a solution as long as we worked under article 11 of the Covenant , Nevertheless, Iraq would, I believed, if the rapporteur pressed it ultimately! acquiesce m this. '/ 5. I asked Signor Pilotti to judge m fairness which side was the reasonable and accommodating and which the unreasonable and intransigent 6. Reverting to the draft proposals for an international authority over the Basra Port Authority, I begged leave to remark in parenthesis that it mioRt have been logical (but m my view not feasible in practice owing to the complex and technical nature of the matter) to say that the 1914 line was to be enforced in every respect and that Persian interests and rights, secured to her under the instruments on which the line was based, must be given instant recognition in concrete form, but it was hardly fair to insist on Persian rights, such as they were,jf and not to give Iraq the rights clearly defined in the same instruments. f 7. As legards Peisian interests in the navigation, Iraq had always pro claimed its readiness to admit Persian participation in the control. The Iraqi objection to the diaft recently offered was that it set out to make far-reachm 0 * alterations in the present arrangements in the Shatt-el-Arab without necessarily contributing to the final solution of the vexed question that was poisoning Iraqi- Persian relations, and which had brought Iraq to the League. Persia was ready to accept it because it went even further than what they had shown themselves ready to accept in the course of the direct negotiations. Iraq would be quite prepared to negotiate on this subject as an integral part of the final solution. (Signor Pilotti’s assistant interposed to say that they contemplated that the measures proposed would be permanent pending a final solution in which they would be incorporated. I said I did not see how we could have a “quasi- definitive ’ ’ solution now with prospects of a final solution in the offing. Progress could only be made if the negotiations of this matter were pursued in connexion with the definite solution.) 8. I said that I had not set out to convert him to any particular view, but 1 hoped I had said enough to convince him that the Iraqi attitude was neither mulish nor fantastic. 9. Signor Pilotti said that he had only learned from the Persians that morning what they said was the real reason for their intransigence. In view of the reserves they had made in adhering to the optional clause, they could not agree ^ . ^ to go to The Hague without parliamentary sanction. Reference to Parliament would provoke an acrimonious debate and further embitter relations with Iraq and possibly shake the Go vern ment. They therefore preferred the third of the proposed solutions, hoping filial something would turn up as a result. 10. I said parliamentary difficulties applied equally to both sides. A strong current of opinion in Iraq had been critical of the proposal to refer to the League. The Cabinet, convinced of the strength of their case and believing that they would get an early decision that Persian aggression must cease unless the 1914 line was proved invalid, had nevertheless persisted. Their position would be impossible if the Minister returned with no solution to show and only what would oe regarded as a surrender on the Shatt-el-Arab. 11. Signor Pilotti said that at Geneva there had seemed some prospect that the Persians might agree to a reference to the Hague provided every aspect q the problem was included, e.g., the extent of Persian rights to participate m control, &amp;c., but the chance now seemed remote.

Drummond to Sir John Simon.- 142.) {Received February 12) (No. 142.) Sir ’ IN my telegram No. 89, despatched in the early^r/ofto mornins I attempted to summarise the position reached in the Perso-Iraqi dispute up’to date; I now have the honour to record in full the events of the last few days in connexion with this case. m 2 Your telegram No. 86 instructing me to inform Baron Aloisi of the a'rave objections which His Majesty’s Government saw to the proposals put forward by the rapporteur ooth from a political and practical standpoint, reached me in thl course of the 7th February, but its text was not completely decyphered until the afternoon Baron Aloisi was engaged m negotiations over the Saar that day and 1 myself had a long discussion with Signor Pilotti of the League Secretariat that afternoon, to which I shall make reference later. In the circumstances, therefore I sent down tne first secretary to see Signor Biancheri, Baron Aloisi’s assistant! Mr. JNichols confined himself m this conversation to saving that the draft con- ven ion proposed by Baron Aloisi was open to the gravest objections, both from a political and practical standpoint, and arranged to give him 'further details early “ e , followl “ g morning before the meeting which was due to take place on the o n 4ebruary between the Persian and Iraqi representatives under Baron Aloisi. 3. I have referred above to a conversation which I had with Signor Pilotti on the afternoon of the 7th February. Signor Pilotti, whom, of course, I know well, has been entrusted by the Secretariat of the League with following and helping the rapporteur in the Perso-Iraqi dispute, and has come to Rome for this purpose. In the course of a very long discussion with him, I was unable to induce him to depart from his thesis that Persia was entitled to have some say in the legal administration of the river. While I need not go at length into the whole of our conversation, one point of importance emerged to which I drew special attention in my telegram under reference, viz., the suggestion made by Signor Pilotti that it might be possible for Persia to agree to go to The Hague Court on the question of the validity of the treaties, and simultaneously to ask that the court should lay down what rights accrued to her as regards the adminis tration of the river from these treaties, and to ask for the framing of regulations to implement such rights, if any. Signor Pilotti also suggested at one moment that the acceptance by Iraq of provisional arrangements under which Persia should participate in the administration of the river might be made conditional by Iraq on acceptance by Persia of a reference to The Hague Court of the validity of the treaties—but in making this suggestion I rather believe he was expressing his own view and had no knowledge of what would be the Persian reaction to such a proposal. 4. Early on the following morning (8th February) the first secretary com municated to Signor Biancheri the letter I had addressed to Baron Aloisi, setting forth the views of His Majesty’s Government on his proposals for a draft convention. (For text of these proposals please see my telegram No. 8 (Saving) of the 5th February.) I enclose a copy of my letter to Baron Aloisi, together with its enclosure; it will be observed that the point regarding the importance His Majesty’s Government attach to British participation in any future permanent arrangements regarding the Shatt-el-Arab is mentioned in the letter itself, whereas the enclosure, in the form of a memorandum, reproduces the arguments on the main issues contained in your telegram No. 86. Signor Biancheri read the letter through with care and at once put his finger on the concluding portion of the covering letter, dealing with the importance which His Majesty s Government attach to British participation. Mr. Nichols pointed out that this was merely an incidental observation, and that the views of His Majesty’s Government were based on the arguments contained in the memorandum. The following is the gist [340 m—2] B2 of the discussion which then took place : It was common ground that Persia could refuse reference to The Hague. In order to get her to The Hague some con cession must be made to her. Signor Biancheri did not think that our offer of the Conservancy Board would prove sufficient attraction. Moreover, he pointed out that the Conservancy Board would contain a British representative. Would the Persians accept this? Mr. Nichols replied that he understood that the Persians had been on the point of accepting the board in 1932. Mr. Nichols said that the objections of His Majesty’s Government to the Italian proposed convention could be summed up in one sentence. It was that these proposals were out of proportion to their avowed aim : the machinery was altogether too heavy and too cumbersome Signor Biancheri took this point and said that the proposals might perhaps be modified. But clearly what was disturbing his mind was the need to find some means, if possible acceptable to Iraq and ourselves, which would induce the Persians to accept jurisdiction by The Hague. Finally, Mr. Nichols said, why not return to the idea of a jurists’ report, and in the meantime come to a short and simple arrangement regarding the avoidance of frontier incidents: to which Signor Biancheri reiterated his cry : “ But will the Persians accept this?” 5. Meanwhile, Mr. Edmonds, with whom I have kept in close touch through the negotiations, had been kind enough to communicate to me a copy of the letter which Nuri Said Pasha had addressed to Baron Aloisi on the 7th February, informing the latter of the instructions he had received to return immediately to Bagdad. From the copy of Nun Said Pasha’s letter, which forms an enclosure to this despatch, it will be seen that ^Nuri Pasha took the opportunity of mformin 0, the rapporteur of the views of his Government regarding the proposals under discussion for a settlement of the dispute. This letter, which is somewhat firm in tone, in effect rejects all proposals for Persian participation in the river administration pending submission of the dispute to juridical settlement. 6. On the morning of the 8th February and after the meeting between the Persian and Iraqi delegates under Baron Aloisi, to which reference is made in paragiaph 2 above, the latter askeo me to go down to see him to talk over the position. He said that he had received my letter and promised to examine very carefully the points raised in it. He wished, however, to tell me that he found INuri I ash a extremely intransigent. Nuri Pasha refused to consider any proposals which were put before him on the ground that he had no instructions from his Government. Baron Aloisi said that if this was the case why had he come to Rome, where it was understood negotiations would take place? I remarked that this hardly seemed to me to be a fair statement of Nuri’s position. As I understood it, he had ’written a letter to Baron Aloisi expressing his willing- f eS f a,( ^ 0 P|' cer tain solutions. Baron Aloisi replied that in that letter Nuri had laid down that his acceptance of the judicial experts to give advice to him (as rapporteur) was dependent on a consequential reference to the Permanent Court, i either of the parties rejected the report. But the Persians refused to take any S rw en S a £ em ^'- I replied that the letter had been explained to me somewhat - -ently. Ine Iraqi representative realised that it was impossible to force ei i j 61 * P art y P°. S° f° The Hague yet against its will, but what they desired was a P e T e 10m P im rapporteur that if either party rejected the report then he would propose to the Council a reference to The Hague. T- Baron Aloisi remarked that this might be so, though it was not in accordance with the text of the letter, but even if it were he vwmld be in a difficult pqsi ion and he doubted whether he could undertake to give such a pledge. It mignt well be that when the moment came other methods of settlement might be . assmg to the question of provisional arrangements, he said that ! ons 0 res erved, he felt bound to put forward some proposal which r g K lve , e a s . a y navigation of the river.

Further, he would be LcTdenfarn^ n? 086 that „ th ^. comi ?ission should only function if and when an which the Perkin^ existin g navigation plan took place, to ch the Persian Government raised objection.

But all these suggestions fell to the ground because of the intransigence of Nuri Pasha. The latter was now going to Bagdad, and he did not expect any settlement could be reached before he left, but he trusted that when he came back, as he declared he would do, his attitude might change. 9. I said that he must remember how the case arose. Iraq had been made a member of the League some years ago. It was clear, therefore, at that time that Iraq was accepted as having defined frontiers, and the frontier between Persia and Iraq was that laid down by what we called “the existing instruments.” Persia had violated that frontier. Iraq, therefore, seemed to me to be perfectly entitled to turn to the League and say : ‘ ‘ The frontier which you recognised has been violated. I must ask you to rectify the situation.” 10. Baron Aloisi did not contest this point of view, but he remarked that, as I knew well, the League’s means were limited, and article 11 implied conciliation and negotiation. Tm ahy~case, he still felt that Persia was entitled to some participation in the administration of the navigation of the river. I continued that, if Persia refused to acknowledge the frontier (Baron Aloisi here interrupted to say that he believed that Persia would be perfectly willing to withdraw her posts north of the river to the 1914 line), Iraq would have the undoubted right to appeal to article 15, but, of course, this would be a serious matter. Baron Aloisi said he agreed that we ought to do all we could to prevent such an appeal, with all its political consequences. At any rate, he would beg me to see whether I could not do something to induce Nuri Pasha to be more moderate when he returned to Rome. Of course, he was not in any way dependent on the agreement of Nuri to his own proposals. He might, indeed, be ^ compelled to set out to the Council what had happened, explaining his suggestions and adding that they had all been summarily rejected by the Iraqi representative. He did not naturally wish to adopt such a course and hoped to avoid it if Nuri, on his return, would show less intransigence. 11. During my discussion with Baron Aloisi on the subject of the treaty, I stated that it was not really fair to ask Iraq to agree to the question of the sovereignty over the river remaining in abeyance indefinitely, that the matter ought to be solved within a reasonable time. If I remembered rightly, even the Barcelona Convention spoke of a state of emergency which gave the owner of a river rights to certain definite and exceptional action. Baron Aloisi, whom fear rather hopes that the plan he has put forward for provisional administration will render any decision on the validity of the treaties unnecessary, sai a , while he acknowledged the force of my remarks, we must not thin m erms o emergency, but rather in terms of peace. I replied that I was qui e prepare to do this, but surely it was better to provide for all possible eventualities and not to leave such an important decision until some crisis aiose. m w 12. I have since seen Mr. Edmonds and explained to him the views held by Baron Aloisi regarding his chief’s so-called intransigence. r. • me that, in fact, It the meeting yesterday, Nuri Pasha found himself m a minority of one and was attacked, not only by th ^ Pe f la “ f e / e S a ^ s ’ Italians and members of the League Secretariat, he lere ° , l- j I see. however, from Sir Francis Humphrys’s telegram addressed to the Foreign Office, No. 30, a copy of which reached me this morning, tha ‘; “ ATisfussing instmetiorw are drafted in such a way as to give him no authonty for discuss g any^change 8 iPthe existing arrangements before the settlement of the juridical question. teleaTams U nder reference I have attempted to summarise the position as I lee id and no useful purpose would appear to be served by a reiteration of those views in this despatc . ^ ERIC DRUMMOND.

My dear Ambassador, Rome, February 8 1935 YOU were good enough to give me the other day an advance copy of the provisional arrangement for the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab, which you intended to place before the Iraqi and Persian representatives. You said at the time that you would be glad to have any observations which I cared to offer with regard to it. Not being an expert on the subject, I telegraphed to London the substance of your proposal and I have now heard from my Government giving me their views on the question. For the sake of convenience, I have set these out in a memorandum, which is attached to this letter. Of course, I need not say that the Iraqi attitude towards the proposal must be determined by Nuri Said Pasha, but you will see that my Government feel that the provisional arrange ments are open to grave objections both on practical and political grounds. 6 I may perhaps add that the present proposals would hardly seem to take into account the very large British interests in the Shatt-el-Arab—interests so great that His Majesty’s Government attach much importance to British participation in any future permanent arrangements regarding that river. This is, however of course only an incidental observation, and the grounds on which His Majesty’s Government take exception to the proposals are those set out in the memorandum. Believe me, &amp;e. ERIC DRUMMOND. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. M emorandum. before the League is a complaint by Iraq that Persia is not merely challenging, but is actively violating, frontier arrangements which have een established lor a long time past. This being so, it is of great importance that no provisional arrangements should be made which could be held to set aside le existing instruments before the latter have been proved invalid, particularly when such arrangements would give practical satisfaction to the aims of the party which is challenging those instruments—namely, the Persians. ^ r y, effect °*. tile P ro P os als now put forward would be virtually to put an t0 i a 6 rig i hts at P resent exercised by Iraq over the waters of the fetiatt-ei-Arab and to place the Iraqis in such a position that they would be una e o cany on the administration of the waterway without obtaining the prior consent of Persia, or at least of the proposed new commission, or of the -League transit Commission. Such an arrangement would give Persia every opportunity for interference and obstruction.

If, however, a final settlement of the legal question has to be postponed, it would be preferable to rest content with the declaration made by both parties at the last Council session, regarding the avoidance of incidents pending a definite solution. Arrangements of the type now proposed appear unnecessary and inappropriate as a purely temporary measure. If the intention underlying the present proposals is that they should ultimately be transformed into or form the basis for a permanent solution, they present no advantages whatever over the existing draft tripartite Conservancy Board Convention. Such a board was provisionally accepted by the Persians in 1932 and has again been offered to them by Nuri Said Pasha on condition that the Persian Government recognise the existing frontier. This Conservancy Board Convention represents a carefully thought out scheme which took many years to devise with highly expert technical assistance for providing for the proper administration of this most difficult waterway.

I HAVE the honour to inform you that I have this morning received from my Government instructions to proceed immediately to Bagdad. While I much regret that reasons should have arisen making my return, after an already unexpectedly prolonged absence, imperative, and that it should not have been possible for me to remain in Rome until a decision should have been taken regarding the procedure to be followed in order to settle definitely the dispute between Iraq and Persia, I trust that in actual fact my departure will not in any way impede progress. I have already infomed you that my Government w^ould agree to the only two proposals that have been made regarding the procedure to be lollowed . willingly, to the proposal that the Council should at once reier the question m dispute to the Permanent Court of International Justice for an advisory opinion, reluctantly, because it is likely to prolong the proceedings unnecessan y, o e proposal that the Council should be asked in the first place to approve e appointment of three judicial experts to assist the rapf orteui m preparing s report, this first step to be followed by a reference to the Permanen ou either of the parties find itself unable to accept the report so ci a e • , As regards the comparatively short period which urns e a P^ ' , present date and the final settlement, the attitude of my over nra/isu ... -uoh be one whereby both parties agreed to respect m its entire y ^ o a rran°ement boundary.

Mr. Edmonds had told him of my conversation yesterday with Baron Aloisi. Nnri Pasha denied that he had shown any intransigence. At the meeting yesterday the rapporteur had first turned to the Persians and asked them whether they would agree to a reference of the juridical question to the court. The Persians refused. Baron Aloisi treated this refusal very lightly, did not insist any further, but simply said : “We will leave this matter on one side for the time being.” He then addressed himself to Nuri Pasha and with the help of the Persians and others invited him very insistently to accept the provisional arrangements proposed for the administration of the river. Nuri stated that he had no instructions from his Government and could not consider them. He said that he had to bear the brunt of an attack on the point for almost an hour. I asked him whether he had not enquired what concessions the Persians would make if his Government admitted the principle contained in the provisional arrangement. He said that he had not done so. He had expected, after the refusal of each side to agree to the rapporteur s proposals, that the latter would himself suggest a bargain, but nothing of the sort occurred. I asked Nuri whether he intended to come back here and he replied that he did. I then indicated to him that in my view it would be most useful if his Government were prepared to agree to make the concessions requested as regards the provisional arrangements for the administration of the river, that he should make a statement to this effect immediately on his return, making, however, the consent of his Government conditional on the acceptance by Persia of a reference to The Hague Court and on the 1914 frontier being considered as valid, pending the court’s decision. Nuri Pasha seemed to indicate that he was prepared at once to adopt such an attitude, but in view of the fact that Baron Aloisi is no longer in Rome and that Nuri Pasha will shortly be seeing his Government, I thought it unwise to probe any further. . . 2. This morning Signor Biancheri, Baron Aloisi s assistant, indicated again to a member of my staff that the Italian Government were somewhat perturbed bv the attitude of the Irani Government.

A more detailed account of this conversation, as related by the Director General himself to the First Secretary of the British Embassy, is at P.Z. 520/35. The last minute on the main question of the Perso-Iraqi dispute is at P.Z. 7902/34 reporting Iraq's appeal t mne somewhat large mass of papers League. the su ^ ^ +n the file show the course of the since added to tli -pnr a settlement of the disiru negotiations for a .pices at Geneva and subsequen y under League auspices at/ 3330 1000 12.34N at Rome. It cannot be said that from the Iraqi and British points of view things have recently gone very well. 2. At the very outset Mr. Eden, the United Kingdom representative urged before the Council that, since an amicable adjustment of the dispute had hitherto been prevented owing to irreconcilable differences of opinion on a purely legal issue, namely the validity of the documents on which the present frontier was based, the opinion of an expert legal body such as the Hague Court should be sought in order to provide the necessary basis for a settlement (P.Z.405/35). The Iraqis are in favour of this, but the Persians, who can hardly fail to realise the extreme weakness of their legal case (see on this the Foreign Office not at Flag A on the validity of the 1913 Protocol and 1914 Delimitation of the Frontier), have opposed this solution and it appears that OY/ing to the unanimous rule they could always block a decision by the Council to request an advisory opinion from the Hague Court (paragraph 2(e) of Rome telegram No.67 at P.Z.756/35). 3. Meanwhile Baron Alois!, the Italian representative on the Council and the rapporteur appointed to compose the dispute, has suggested provisional arrangements in the Shatt-el-Arab (pending the final settlement of the dispute) which would in effect conflict with the authority of the Basra Port Directorate and give the Persians a large measure of control in the Shatt, waters oi which (with the exception of the Persian anchorage Mohammerah) are purely Iraqi according to the present frontier g. .873/35 and P.Z.1047/35 (French text of rapporteur's proposal^.

Baron Aloisi proposes that the Iraqis should agree to his suggestions as to provisional arrangements in return for Persian agreement to the appointment of three jurists to assist the rapporteur to prepare his report and subsequent reference^ to the Hague if his report should prove unacceptable to either party. He professes to regard the Iraqi attitude in refusing to agree to his suggested provisional arrangements as intransigent and there is a danger that in his report he may put the blame on the Iraqis in the event of failure to compose the dispute. 4. The Foreign Office are somewhat disturbed at the Italian attitude on this question and there are strong suspicions which are shared by Sir Francis Humphry's that the Italians are anxious to placate thePersians with a view to obtaining advantages for themselves, such as a Persian order for additional warships from Italy and the reinstatement of Italian officers serving with the Persian Navy, and that they have ambitions of adopting the role of mediator in the Shatt by substituting Italy for Great 1 u Britain as the neutral State which would provide the third member to any board constituted to control the navigation of the river. There can be little doubt that Baron Aloisi, and also the League Secretariat, are aiming at the permanent internationalisation of the Shatt which would not be at all in accordance with British interests (see paragraph 6 of Rome telegram Bo.8.; of 8th .ebru y P.Z.1109/35). The poreign Office also disapprove o the h+ t0 .gar t y the Italians on Nuri Pasha to pressure brought to bear vy sign/sign the Italo-Iraqi Treaty of friendship at once when an Italian is acting as rapporteur in the frontier dispute (P.Z.754/35). 5. The Foreign Office have advised the Iraqis to continue to reject the temporary arrangements in the Shatt suggested by the rapporteur and to press for a settlement of the juridical issue, while making it clear that Iraq is still prepared to offer Persia the Conservancy Board, a Bon Yoisinage Agreement, etc. as soon as the question of the validity of the frontier has been disposed of; Puri Pasha, who has recently been recalled by the Iraqi Government to Bagdad for consultation, is sending a letter on these lines to the rapporteur (F.0.telegram No.61 of 13tli February to Bagdad at P.Z.11X6/35 and Bagdad telegram No.42 of 16th February at P.Z.1214/35). It is indeed just possible that but for the attitude of the Italian rapporteur at the Persians (who had tirst betrayed their nervousness at the reference of the dispute to the League by making irequent appeals to His Majesty^ Government at Tehran, Geneva and London to use their influence to persuade the Iraqis to compromise on the question of the frontier) might already have agreed to the solution now proposed by the Iraqis. In this connection the records at P.Z.838/35 of the Persian Minister's conversations at the Foreign Office Witl1 Ivir * Renclel and Sir Robert Vansittart on 28th and 29th January last are worth reading. 6. The tentative Foreign Office suggestion (mentioned the second paragraph of the minute at P.Z.7902/34) for a compromise of the frontier cpuestion in the Shatt on the basis of the offer to the Persians of the Thalweg or midstream line in return for their acceptance of the C ''™ 0y B °* ra «“• receded i„tc the ! “&gt; ire,', epp,.! to the Leegu. „d «.«. c.» P, „ question ^ such s^estion Oeing mooted/Minute Paper.

It may, however, be mentioned that the Foreign Office case has been even further weakened by the strong opposition recently expressed by Sir Francis Humphrys (supported by the Minister at Tehran) to any readjustment of the frontier (P.Z.708/35) and by the recent information that, owing to a change in the conformation of the mud banks at the mouth of the river, the whole of the Rooka Channel (the deep water approach to the Shatt) now lies exclusively in Iraqi waters. 7. The pressure brought to bear on the Iraqis to accept a compromise and their failure as yet to obtain any satisfaction from the League, a.lthough they have an apparently foolproof legal case, and the way in which the Persians, with a weak case, have been able to prevent a reference of the dispute to the Hague Court or even, up to the present, to a Committee of Jurists, do not inspire much confidence in League procedure in cases of this kind and the progress of this dispute will no doubt be borne in mind in connection with the question of the Persian claim to Bahrain being referred to the League.

Sir, I have the honour to forward a copy of a Note of a conversation between Mr. Phillip, the American Minister at Teheran and myself at Baghdad on the 8th Of March, 1927, regarding the Mohammerah-Caspian Railway and the Turco- Persian Boundary on the Shatt-al-Arab. 2. There have been several recent indications that Persia desires to raise the question of the validity of the Turco-Persian frontier delimitation of 1913-14. The arrangement between Persia and the Anglo-Persia Oil Company regarding customs and other matters on the Naftkhana oil-fields in the Transferred Territories near Khanaqin has been challenged by the Majlis partly on the ground, it is believed, that the Majlis has never ratified the frontier delimitations and, on the same ground, the Persian Customs are unwilling to fix a terminus on the frontier beyond Khanaqin for the projected extention of the Iraq railways from Khanaqin to the frontiers. It is evident that the doubts and difficulties which Mr. Poland feels about the fixing of the southern terminus of the projected railway from the Caspian to the Gulf will powerfully stimulate Persia to raise the question. But it is difficult to see how she can approach it seriously without first formally recognising 1 Iraq. 3. That there is some justification for Persian restiveness on the subject of Port dues and control is shown by the attached Note which sets forth the fact that what is practically the Persian Port of Abadan and the undoubtedly Persian Port of Mohammerah now yield at least one-third of the effective revenues of the “Port of Basrah”. Something could probably be done to soothe Persian fears by the early formation of the long discussed Basrah Port Trust and the appoint ment to it of a Persian Commissioner. But the ‘ Iraq Government would certainly refuse to approach this question also before Persia had granted formal recognition of ‘ Iraq. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Britannic Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople, His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Teheran and to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, and am communicating the Note of my conversation to'the Prime Minister of ‘ Iraq.

It seemed not to have been published and the Persian Government and their American Advisers were concerned about it, particularly in relation on the siting of the terminus of the new railway from the Caspian to the Persian Gulf. Apparently under that convention the boundary of( 3 ) ‘ Iraq was the left shore of the Shatf Q i ^ , „ is usual They were not clear how far’this 1 ^^^^!!^ fb ° f the stream ’ fees and port dues on goods passing throuo'lho MolT th ® 'u 8 ]* to im P ose tran sit Poland, the Chief Engineer of the Raflwly g^rve. t “TT H ^ the Gulf - Mr - question and was even contemplating laviha mn n’ i ga ; ly worned about this as to avoid the Shatt-al-Arab and KL^ennun s^o rh^K^' ™ute so (or Khor Abdulla, I forget which) on the Pershn Onlf aa ° Khor expensive than having the terminus at Mohammernhb m° U , d bemuoh more worse port.

The Shah had quite g ven up hf fantastic idea of waiting until the rails could be manufactured in Persia. P , . 1 ® ald tllat &gt; 80 far as I could remember without reference to papers the history of the iurco-l ersian frontier delimitation was as follows. By the Tr’eatv of Erzerum of 1846 between Turkey and Persia, the frontier was vaguely outtined m no delimitation had taken place and the border administration fluctuated Somewhere about 1908 Turkey made considerable encroachments on what was undoubtedly Persian territory, especially in the direction of Azerbaijan, and the question of delimitation became urgent in the eyes of Persia. After some negotia tions (m which I thought, but was not sure, that Persia had invoked Great Britain as an arbitrator under the Anglo-Persian Treaty of 1857), the Turkish Foreign Minister or Grand Vizier and the British, Russian and Persian Ambassadors signed a convention at Constantinople laying down the frontier in considerable detail and agreeing to its being delimited by a joint Commission in which I believed the Rus sian Commissioner practically represented the Turkish point of view and the British Commissioner the Persian point of view. The convention provided that the find ings of the Commission were to be final and that the Commissioners should transfer any transferable territory on the spot and immediately set up boundary pillars. The Commission met in 1913 and had just finished its work and embodied it in a Protocol when Turkey declared war on the Allies. So far at least as the ‘Iraq portion was concerned, the ‘territories transferable under the delimitation had been actually transferred by the erection of boundary pillars. By this delimitation the frontier of Turkey followed low-water mark on the left side of the Shatt, but I was not sure whether this had not also been mentioned in the Treaty of Erzerounn Persia enjoyed rights of navigation in times of peace and the boundary was so arranged as to give a considerable space of water at the mouth of the Karim River opposite Mohammerah to Persia. In time of war I presumed ‘ Iraq would have the right to act in the Shatt as other Governments have the right to act in their ter ritorial waters. I conceived the position of the Shatt to be not unlike that of the Scheldt, the mouth of which is Butch territorial water, although the Belgian port of Antwerp lies further up and navigation through the Scheldt to Antwerp is free.. I did not see why the Persians or Mohammerah should be more hampered by this situation than are the Belgians and Antwerp by the situation on the mouth of the Scheldt. It was evidently a considerable surprise and shock to the Minister to hear that Russia had been a partner to the frontier delimitation. He had apparent!} imagined that it had been the result of a direct deal between Great Britain and Turkey. I made no mention of the question of the recognition of Raq by 1 ersia, without which it is obvious that no attempt at frontier negotiation could be undertaken. Si)/- H. Hobbs.( 4 ) H.B.M’s Legation, Teheran, March 25th, 1927. My dear Dobbs, I was very much interested to read your despatch Confidential C of March the 10th to the Colonial Office. I think there is no doubt whatever that even should the Persian Gfovernrnent ever go so far as to denounce the duico-Persian Frontier Agreement of 1914 the Treaty of Erzerum makes it quite clear that the frontier follows the left bank of the Shatt-al-Arab and not the centre of the stream. You asked me in a private letter of March the 9th whether there is anything in the Persian Constitution which necessitates ratification by the Majlis of the decision of the Commission. I am afraid that technically no transference of Persian territory is legal without Majlis ratification and that this was so in 1914. The fact that for about six years during and after the war there was no Majlis does not really affect the legal position in my opinion. Havard tells me that Teymourtache, to whom he was talking recently about fire Gano-ir water trouble, mentioned that Turkey was making trouble over some territory which had been transferred to Persia by the decision of the Frontier Commission. He gathered that Teymourtache did not want the validity of the Commission’s decision to be raised but considered that in the last resort, if Turkey persisted, Persia might be forced to do so on the pretext that Majlis confirmation was necessary. Havard considered that technically Majlis confirmation to all territorial changes was necessary in 1914 and it is today. Of course Persia may well consider, in view of the oil that has been disco\ ered in the transferred territories since 1914, that she stands to gain by questioning the validity of the Frontier Agreement. I sincerely hope that she will not do so. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Foreign Office. Yours sincerely, Sd/- R. H. Clive. His Excellency, Sir Henry R.C.

Sir, I have the honour to invite your attention to my despatch Confidential C dated the 10th of March, 1927, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, a copy o which was forwarded to you under cover of my despatch No. S.O. 576 dated the 10th of March, 1927, on the subject of a conversation between myself and Mr. Hoffman Philip in regard to the frontier between Persia and ‘ Iraq. 2. There have been various indications during the last two years of a possibility that the Persian Government may, at some future time, attempt to challenge the validity of the decisions of the Boundary Commission of 1913-14 on the ground that those decisions were never ratified by the Majlis. I should be grateful if you could inform me whether any such intention has ever been hinted at by Persian officials in conversation, and whether there is in your opinion, any serious possibility of such a challenge being attempted.1 A^&gt; tic Sth lis does Dip. mmm. i of tie life .e valijefl resort, I li sjlis coifiii: incerelj, a.c® M able to discover frnm T would appear that the protocol of November ion at my dis P os al it of the frontier, were merely steps taken Erzemm, and to determine the frontier rnnu-Mf o n ! 0t 1 tlie 1847 treaty of If this is the case, then it would apX that I rnKfi t m ^ 2 of that Treaty.

I am =iy f tttSittt!r tion ’ but i4 appears to ^ ^ 4 ^ Inle such documents as I have been able to consult give no indication whatever that ratification of the findings of the frontier commission was either explicitly or implicitly necessary, it is possible (though, I conceive unlikely) that such ratification may have been explicitly provided for in some document to which I have not had access, or may be implicitly necessitated by some article in the Persian constitution. I should be grateful for any information which you could °'ive me in this regard. 5. The formal setting up of boundary pillars usually implies an immediate transfer of sovereignty. While the “transferred territories” have been continuously under the administration, first of the army of occupation and then of the ‘ Iraq Government, I have been unable to trace any record of a formal transfer of administration. Such local enquiries as I have been able to pursue go to show that the territory was, prior to 1914, not effectively administered by either the Persian or the Turkish Government, The authority of the ‘ Iraq Government over these territories has not so far been challenged by the Persian Government, and has been implicitly recognised in the correspondence regarding the nonpayment of sheep tax by the Sinjabi tribe during their sojourn in these territories. 6 . It further appears that in 1920 a joint inspection of the frontier was carried out by an Indian Surveyor Sher Jang Khan, and a Persian official named Muez ez Sultan. I am unable to trace any correspondence as to the preliminary arrangements for this inspection. It would appear, however, to have been the result of an official arrangement with the Persian Government, and a perusal of the correspondence, copies of which presumably exist in the Legation, may show how far, by acquiescing in the arrangements for this inspection, the Persian Government committed 'themselves to an acceptance of the frontier as laid down by the Commission in 1914. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary of State for the Colonies,’His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador, Constantinople and to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Sib E.H. Clive, K.C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Teheran.No. 111. Confidential. British Legation Teheran. Sir, 23rd April, 1927. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your despatch S. 0 . 715 Con fidential of March 31st on the question of the validity of the decision of the Turco- Persian Frontier Commission of 1913-14. 2. I entirely agree with Your Excellency’s conclusions that ratification was never provided for or even contemplated and my impression is that it has only quite recently occurred to the Persian Government to attempt to question the validity of the Commission’s findings. 3 . The only possible justification for the present attitude of the Persian Government ( they have not, it must be remembered, taken up this attitude officially ) lies in Article 22 of the Fundamental Law of 1906-7, which runs as follows: — In cases where a part of the revenues or property of the State or of the country is transferred or sold or in cases where it is found necessary to change the boundaries or frontiers of the country, it shall be done with the ratification of the National Consultative Assembly In view however of the fact that the Frontier Commission of 1913 fixed the details of the frontier in accordance with provisions of the Treaty of Erzerum of 1847 sixty years anterior to the date of the Persian Constitution, I feel extremely doubtful whether, if the matters were ever submitted to arbitration, a Persian contention would be upheld that the decisions of the Commission required to be ratified by the Majlis. 5. The various documents and actions which -Your Excellency cites strongly support the supposition that ratification was never intended or required, and I consider that if the Persian Government ever should put forward a request to discuss the matter we should be justified in refusing to do so. 6 . I am forwarding copies of this correspondence to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and of this despatch to the Government of India. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your Excellency’s most obedient, humble servant, Sd/- E. H. Clive. His Excellency, Sir Henry E.C.

My dear Hobbs, I did not send you officially the particulars regarding the' inspection of frontier posts by Slier Jang in 1920 asked for in the sixth paragraph of your confidential despatch No. 715 dated 31-3-27, and to which you again referred in youi confidential lettei No. S. 0. 940 of April 30th, because I thought that our position regarding the practical ( as opposed to the theoretical ) acceptance by the Persian Government of the existing frontier hardly required fortification. Perhaps however 4 should have answered your direct enquiry at the time and do so now, as follow )ws:- ^ L( 8 ) 2 . In the Secretary of State’s opinion there can be no question as to the validity of the frontier settlement of 1913-1914. In the first place, that settlement merely defined in greater detail the provisions of the Treaty of Erzernm, which was signed sixty years' before the Persian Constitution and therefore did not require ratification by the Mejlis; secondly, the terms of the Protocol of November 17th 1913 , itself (Article 5) show clearly that ratification wms never intended or required; and thirdly, the settlement has been tacitly accepted by the Persian Government, and even by the Mejlis itself, for more than twelve years. 3 . In view of these considerations Sir Austen Chamberlain has informed Sir R. Clive in the telegram, a copy of which is enclosed herein, that he fully agrees with his suggestion that His Majesty’s Government would, be justified in refusing to discuss the validity of the decisions of the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission if the Persian Government raised it officially.

When I wrote to Sir Henry my private letter of March 25th I had not received his official despatch of March 31st and had not then studied the voluminous correspondence on the subject which I have since been able to do although I was aware of the relevant article in the Persian Constitution regarding the necessity for ratification in the case of any transfer of territory.' 3.

Copy of a paraphrased telegram No. 121 Dated 25th June, 1927, From Sir Egbert Clive, Teheran, to Foreign Office, London. Very Confidential. Addressed to Foreign Office No. 121 repeated to Government of India No. 48. I had a long conversation with Minister of Court to-day in the course of which he made clear what he now meant by “ exchange of views.” Persian Government are much easier in their minds regarding the danger of hostilities between Great Britain and Eussia. He told me that the Shah was much exercised by present attitude of Turkey and Turkish Government had ( ? gp. omt.) Persia clearly to understand that she was not going to be bound by 1913 protocol; they had consequently advanced their frontier posts in several places to old line and were encouraging Kurdish raiding parties. Persia had last year made neutrality agreement with Turkey to guard against this very danger. In reply to a request by him for my views of Turkish policy I said I had no knowledge of Turkey My impression was however that Turkish relations with all European powers including Italy had much improved, that her friendship with Eussia was unnatural, and that her present orientation was Asiatic. Minister said that this entirely agreed with the Persian view. This Asiatic orientation which was direct danger to Persia was feared by Persian Government. Minister of Court then asked what was the view of my Government who were signatories of 1913 protocol towards validity of decisions of frontier commis sion. 1 replied that decisions of the commission had been put m force m accordance with the protocol and have remained unquestioned. His Majesty s o’vernmen did not therefore consider the matter was one for discussion. He then asked whether His Majesty s Government \ Wnrlu conditions support this view. I said I was unable to answer this question W ori( ! had changed. The Eussian Government which had authorised Eussian Ambas at Constantinople to sign protocol in 1913 was now replace y » ov . - me with whom we had no relations. He begged me to enquire a n a ft thought to treat the matter as very confidential. Finally he adde a mos , ,. , count that Persia would be forced to turn to Eussia in self-de ence i . p to have upon the support of His Majesty’s Government. I consider this last remark to been in the nature of a bluff. In any case I ignored i • Above is with reference to your telegram No. 1 5( 10 ) Copy OF A PARAPHRASED TELEGRAM No. 89 DATED 12TH JULY, 1927, FROM Foreign Office, London, to Sir Robert Clive, Teheran. Persian relations with Turkey and Russia reference your telegram No. 121 of June 25th. His Majesty’s Government have no reason to conceal their view that the decisions of the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission and protocol of 1913 are unquestionably valid. This however does not mean that they are prepared to intervene in any dispute on the subject between Persia and Turkey. It should therefore be made clear to the Persian Government, if they return to the question, that the present dispute is regarded by His Majesty’s Government as a matter purely for settlement between Persia and Turkey, and in these circum stances they feel that any public pronouncement of their views, unless requested by both parties to the dispute, would serve no useful purpose. Confidential. I realise that, in face of this explanation, threat to look to Russia for support may be reiterated by Persian government but much as I should regret such a • development, I think we must take the risk. For your guidance. I am not impressed by the threat to rely upon Russia. In recent Persian policy I have not observed much evidence of a sincere desire to cultivate friendship with His Majesty’s Government. The Persian Government are more ready to ask our aid than to perform their promises or discharge their obligations to us. ( Cf. Sheikh of Mohammerah, debt and tariff.) Copy No. 356. Secret. British Legation, Gulhek, July, 16th, 1927, Sir, With reference to my telegram No. 121 of June 25th and to your telegram No. 89 of July 13th on the subject of the present Turco-Persian frontier troubles I have the honour to submit the following observations :— 2. Shortly after my conversation with the Minister of the Court on June 25th a brief but very violent and abusive press campaign started against the Turks, accusing them of having ambitions on Persian territory. I telegraphed accordingly to His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz and requested him to try and ascertain and to report the actual facts. Mr. Gilliat-Smith replied on July 5th that Turkish troops had crossed the frontier near Bazurgah towards the end of May ostensibly in pursuit of rebel Kurds. The Persian Authorities protested and the Turkish troops were withdrawn. Two days later I saw the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and asked him what the present position was, and whether the Persian Government had based the protest, which I understood they had made, on the 1913 protocol. Pakravan confirmed that the Persian Government had protested but said the protest had not been based on the protocol. He added that a place called Sirosatik South-West of Lake Urumia had been occupied by the Turks. What the Persian Government particularly objected to was the presence of armed bands of Turkish Kurds who continued to violate the frontier in spite of the assurances of the Turkish Government that the Kurds had all been disarmed. A few days ago the French Military Attache asked Major Fraser what all the trouble was about. The French Consul at Tabriz who was usually well-inform ed had reported that the position on the frontier was not exceptional. It seems evident therefore that Teymourtache deliberately exaggerated the state of affairs to me for some reason which is not clear.( 11 ) General Staff.

Sir, Tour most obedient humble servant, Sd/- R. H. Clive. Thk Right Honourable Sir Austen Chamberlain, K.G., M.P., Foreign Office. No. 369. Beitish Legation, Gulhek. 29th July, 1927. Sir. TV ith reference to my despatch No. 356 of July 16th regarding the troubles on the Turco-Persian frontier, I have the honour to report that I recently had a conversation on the subject with the Turkish Ambassador who came to see me before going on leave. 2 . Memdouh Chevket Bey made light of the question of the actual frontier and said there would be no difficulty in settling that with the Persian Government. When I pointed out that I understood the frontier had been finally settled under the 1913 protocol by the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission, he replied that the findings of the Commission had never been ratified by the Turkish Government. The Ambassador went on to say that the real difficulty was how to deal with the Kurds on the frontier. The Turkish Authorities had done their best to disarm them, but they found that these Kurdish raiders were always able to purchase arms on the Persian side of the frontier. I said I was very surprised to hear this as the Persian Government maintained that these Kurds obtained their arms from Turkish sources. The Ambassador repeated that this was quite impossible. In any case the pioblem, and it was a very acute one, was to prevent the Kurds making trouble. He did not appear to favour the policy of extermination, but talked vaguely of educating and civilising them. 3. A few days later I asked the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs whether there had been any new developments in the situation. _ I told him o m\ com eisa ion with the Turkish Ambassador. Pakravan said that His Excellency lac no accuse the Persians of furnishing the arms but had maintained that the Kur s ia o 3 an their arms elsewhere than in Turkey.( 12 ) 4 I asked Pakravan whether it was true that Feroughi had been told to go to ■Vneora on his way back from Europe in the autumn to discuss the whole question. He replied that it was possible Feroughi might go but nothing had yet hppn settled. 5 His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz has since reported that near Kizil Dizeh on the Persian side of the frontier there is a small area which the Turks maintain should by right belong to them and that for the past few years they have been in the habit of invading this stretch of land during the harvest season and carrying off the crops which are the property of the Persian village owners while leaving to the peasants the share which belonged to them. This may refer to Serasatik the place mentioned by Pakravan in my despatch under reference. 6 It is quite clear however that no serious situation has yet arisen and that Teymourtache deliberately exaggerated the state of affairs to me three weeks ago. I am forwarding copies of this despatch to Government of India and His Majesty’s Acting High Commissioner for ‘ Iraq, Baghdad.

Copy No. 2416/108/1927. Secret. My dear Osborne, British Embassy, Therapia. 25th August, 1927. The local press of Constantinople has lately confirmed the statement in your letter of the 11th August (E. 3377/2822/34) that the Persian Government intend to send a prominent politician to Turkey, though here the reason ascribed to the visit was a desire to settle the outstanding border questions which have caused some ill- feeling between the two countries of late. A? To us, especially in the light of the information enclosed in your letter, it •seems likely that Eeroughi will try to arrange something with Turkey on the following lines:— Turkey, Persia and Russia will all deny the validity of the 1913 delimitation of the Turco-Persian boundary. Turley would thereby gain (subject to negotiation with Persia) the small strips of territory in the Tabriz latitude that she seems to covet, as well as a measure of Persian co-operation in the subjugation of the Kurdish tribes which is of import ance to her. She would also see with some satisfaction the weakening of 4 Iraq caused by the Persian claims enumerated below.( 13 ) I trust matters will, however, not come to such a pass and will inform you in good time of anything I hear about negotiations in Angora, though such news is not easily come by these days.

Addressed to Foreign Office No. 5 repeated to Baghdad No. 1. Persian Government have unofficially asked if I would telegraph to enquire- whether ‘ Iraq Government would be willing to discontinue construction of a frontier guard station at Baghshah in transferred territory pending settlement with Turkish Government of frontier matters now being discussed with Persian Ambassador. I pointed out that Persian Government appeared indirectly to be raising question of validity of Turco-Persian Protocol of 1913. I was told in reply that Turkish Government had stated they did not recognise protocol. I replied that His Majesty’s Government considered matter settled and not open to discussion. I added that if admitting this, Persian Government arranged with Jurkish Government for some rectification of frontier, or if after recognition ol iaq ersian Government wished by diplomatic means to approach Iraq Go\ernmen vi i a view to some small rectification of frontier I did not suppose that my o\ erninen would object.

Perso - 1 Iraq frontier). I approve your language.No. 77 &lt; 166/4/28.) British Embassy, Constantinople. 1st February, 1928. Sir, Recent reports ending with my despatch No. 52 of the 25th of January last on the subject of Turco-Persian relations call for amplification on one point. 2 . When Memdouh Shevket Bey left Angora for Constantinople and Teheran, he was accompanied as far as the former city by Mahommed Ali Khan Feroughi, who was reported to be returning to Constantinople to await the receipt of instructions from his Government, to whom he had reported the present state of the negotiations. 3 . To a reporter on the platform at Constantinople Memdouh Shevket Bey stated that “the frontiers and the tribes are the subject of our present conversations.” 4. This statement was confirmed by the Persian envoy in an informal conversation at luncheon with me today in the course of which Mahommed Ali Khan alleged that the Turkish Government had categorically refused to recognise the sanctity of the Turco—Persian boundary delimitation of 1914 on the ground that they had “abrogated every treaty made by their predecessors and consequently did not hold themselves bound by this agreement.” 5. The upshot however seems to have been considerable perplexity on the part of the Persian envoy, if not of the Persian Government itself, as to the manner in which to persuade the Turkish Government of the necessity of respecting the 1914 agreement, the Turks having apparently violated the frontier in certain places and even revised to some extent their wartime claims to Persian soil in Azerbaijan. “ Pan-Turanianism ” said Feroughi “ dies hard in Turkey ” and the Persian envoy has taken the obvious step of asking for instructions from Teheran and sitting down the while to enjoy Constantinople after a second arduous period of forty-five days at Angora. 6 . All this is of importance to His Majesty’s Government only if it leads to the validity of the Perso- ( Iraq frontier being called into question by a Government desirous at least of off setting its losses to Turkey by a corresponding gain from ‘ Iraq. 7. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Teheran and to His Majesty’s High Commissioner at Baghdad for their information. I I have the honour to be, with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, George R. Clerk.

Reference my telegram No. 8 . Minister of the Court ignoring his other guests last night after dinner took me to his study. Conversation lasted till 2 the next morning. Prime Mmister was also present. Settlement with Iraq as one of the principal neighbours of Persia was also essential. He mentioned 1913 protocol and said that it was Turkey and not Persia who did not admit its validity. In the event of Turkey persisting to show this attitude, it was not fair that Persia, who under it had obtained satisfactory frontier in Azerbaijan, should be bound by its terms elsewhere, where she had ceded territory. Protocol ceased to have effect if one party to the protocol refused to abide by it. Persia felt therefore that a settlement of frontier question with 4 Iraq was essential The good offices of His Majesty’s Government were counted upon to help bring about normal rela tions with ‘ Iraq and to obtain sympathetic attitude towards questions which Persia • desired to settle. Extract From Paraphrased telegram No. 6 dated 12th January, 1928, From Foreign Office, London, to Sir Robert Clive, Teheran. With reference to your telegram No. 11 (of the 9th January with regard to the negotiations with Persia). The remarks of Minister of the Court are disquieting, and unless any grave 'objection is seen you should warn him at once, in terms which will leave him undei no possible misapprehension, that His Majesty’s Government cannot on certain matters make the slightest concession to Persian ambitions. For example we can not admit the validity of their pretensions to Bahrein or acquiesce in any form o attempt on their part to undermine the position in those Islands. Nor can we, m order to obtain advantages for ourselves, make any concession to the 1 ersian overn ment at the expense of ‘ Iraq. We should, I think, continue to emphasize that questions which affect the Government of 4 Iraq must be dealt wn _separa e F on their own merits, for in them our obligations to the League o x a ions an the Government of ‘ Iraq leave us little liberty of action. ITRACT FROM VERY CONFIDENTIAL DESPATCH No. 19 DATED 12TH JANUARY, from Sir Robert Clive, K.C.M.G., H.B.M’s Minister, Teheran, to Austen Chamberlain, K.G., M.P., Foreign Office, London As I shall not have a further opportunity t 'A s “ &gt; bag leaves, I will attempt to clarify the summ y g die 9th January of his Excellency’s remarks on the subject ot Iraq • ^ -i - -ic nf the frontier question. He He spoke however, without going into (e . &lt; liro t 0 col. It was not Persia I Turkey did not admit the validity ot the, &lt; Sons were now in progress ich had disputed this, but Turkey. Protrac e H o ((ues tion on the Turco- Arngora, in order to reach a settlement of the Kurdish quePersian frontier in Azerbaijan. The Frontier Commission in 1913-14 had laid down a sound geographical frontier with which the Persian Government were quite content. ^lf, however, the Turks were to persist in their present attitude, where would Persia he ? She might be forced to lose her good frontier in Azerbaijan while being held to her present frontier with ‘ Iraq where in many places she had had to yield territory. That was not fair and if the protocol was denounced by one party the other party could not be bound by it. In other words the protocol lapsed. 3 . I made no comment on this beyond repeating what I had said to^ Muntakhab-ul-Mulk, head of the English section in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs,, as reported in my telegram No. 5 of the 2nd January, namely that His Majesty’s Government considered the frontier as laid down as chose jugee and not open to discussion, although if Persia arranged by diplomatic means with either or both of her neighbours for some slight rectification my Government would have no objection. 4. Teymourtache, who had evidently sent Muntakhab-ul-Mulk to raise the question with me, was aware of the reply I had made. 5 . He went on to say that there were other important matters to settle with ‘ Iraq and he hoped that he could count on the support of His Majesty’s Govern ment to help in reaching a settlement. 6 . Although his Excellency did not go into details in regard to the frontier question, I have the impression that what he principally had in mind was the Shatt- al-Arab and the desire of the Persian Government that the frontier should be fixed in mid-stream instead of the left bank at low water as at present. This is certainly a very natural desire on the part of the Persian Government and one which has become more urgent in the course of the present year from the point of view of the southern terminus of the railway. Nobody has been deceived by the talk of Khor Musa. Everyone realises that if the southern section of the railway is ever to be built Mohammerah is the natural and obvious terminus. 7. I am not sending a copy of this despatch to Baghdad, but should be grateful to learn whether you would wish me to give any encouragement to his Excellency in regard to the Shatt-al-Arab frontier in case I am right in thinking that that v T as what he chiefty had in mind. 8 . Another way, no doubt, in which the good offices of His Majesty’s Government would be highly appreciated would be if it were possible by any means to influence the Turkish Government to accept the frontier agreed to in 1913. The Persian Government have not asked for our good offices in this connexion and any interference on our part might v T ell be resented by the Turkish Government. It is with diffidence, therefore, that I mention this. (No. 587/55/34). To Persia. Cypher telegram to Sir E.Clia'e (Teheran). Foreign Office 5.30 p.m. Utli February, 19k8. No. 31.

It appears that the Minister of the Court imagines that Persia can make lontier concessions to Turkey and then, with our assistance or tacit consent, recoup herself at the expense of Iraq.

I asked Minister of the Court for indication of points Persian Government wished to raise. His Excellency mentioned the frontier line on the left bank of Shatt-al-Arab. I said that this was a question to be raised with ‘ Iraq Government after recogni tion. He said that he recognised that no agreement could be made till then but would it be possible to discuss the question with a view to an agreement after recognition. I said that I did not think so. He enlarged on the unfairness to Persia of the present frontier which should according to universal custom be in mid-stream. He cited other points on land frontier with ‘Iraq. I gave no encouragement. Extract from Private and Confidential letter dated the 3rd April, 1928, from Sir Robert Clive, K.C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Teheran to Sir Henry R. C. Hobbs, K.C.S.I., K.C.M.G., K.C.I.E., I.C.S., His Majesty’s High Commissioner for 1 Iraq, Baghdad. To show how keen they are on coming to terms with ‘Iraq I may add that Teymour raised, in the course of our interview, the question of the frontier m the Shatt-al-Arab. He talked about the whole frontier as delimited m 1913 and said that broadly the Persians had gained in the north and lost_ m the south and now the Turks refused to recognise the northern frontier. Phis was very un air o Persia and he hoped the ‘ Iraq Government would be willing to discuss the question of various points on the frontier but especially in the Shatt-al-Aia . sa these questions could not be raised before recognition. He sai le qui &lt; , this but could they not be discussed with a view to coming to some agreement a r ecognition. I said I thought not.Copy No. 182 (166/8/28.) British Embassy, Angora. April 8th, 1928. With regard to the Turco-Persian frontier negotiations which formed the subieet of my despatch No. 178 of 2 nd instant, the Under Secretary of the Ministry for Foreion Affairs told me on the next day that practically complete agreement had been reached. There was, he said, no question of a new treaty but of a protocole d apphcation ” of the relevant clauses of the existing Tuico-Persian treaty of 22nd April, 1926. Furthermore, there was no question of frontier modi fication. The boundary was to be left as settled in 1913. 2 In order to check this statement I caused Feroughi Khan to be sounded in Constantinople. What he said was confirmatory. ^ The Turks were concerned to make the frontier safe, the Persians to have it fixed. The two parties were therefore now engaged in working out an amplification of certain articles (evidently 5 and 6 ) in the 1926 treaty. They also had to provide for marking out the frontier, as on the outbreak of the war the work of delimitation had been left incomplete and subsequently the Turks had deliberately knocked down the pillars on other sections of the boundary. Without saying so explicitly, he implied that the boundary to be followed was the old one of 1913. 3 Feroughi Khan hopes to conclude the negotiations as soon as Tewfik Rushdi Bey returns to Angora, but he has enough knowledge of diplomatic dealings here to be afraid of a hitch at the eleventh hour. 4.

Hobbs, K.C.S.I., K.C.M.G., K.C.I.E., I.C.S., His Majesty’s High Commissioner for ‘ Iraq, Baghdad, to Sir B.H. Clive/ K.C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Teheran. There is one point in the Persian arguments which I think it important to combat every time that it is put forward and that is the question of the frontier along the Shatt-al-Arab. Whatever may have been the case with the land frontier north of Mohammerah, there is no doubt whatever that both the de facto and de jure frontier south of that point has, ever since the Treaty of Erzerum signed in 1847, been the eastern or left bank of the Shatt and not the “ Thalweg or centre of the stream, as Persia would like it to be. It was so defined in Article ^ of that Treaty and, a bank not being in need of delimitation, there was no difficulty about its recognition from the day of signature of the Treaty. So far as I know, it was never called in question before the war either by the Turks or the Persians. The Frontier Commission of 1913-14 made no change in this direction except to define the eastern bank as the low water line; so that, with regard to the line of the Shatt, Teymourtache’s argument that Persia under the Frontier Commission’s decisions lost something in the south which should now be restored to her, because Turkey won’t recognise her gains under the same decisions in the north, falls completely to the ground. I imagine that, because of the projected railway from Mohammerah, Persia considers this Shatt frontier question far more urgent than that of any other portion of the frontier; so it is most necessary, it seems to me, to rub into her the fact that she has no grievance and not a leg to stand on in this respect.( 19 ) Extract From Despatch No. 178 dvted tth- on,.

Copy of a Paraphrased Telegram No. 237 dated the 25th of April, 1928, From High Commissioner, Baghdad, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, London, Repeated to Prodrome Teheran No. 57. Teheran’s despatch setting forth all circumstances connected with recent Persian proceedings has just been seen by me. This shows such calculated and official unfriendliness towards ‘ Iraq on part of Persia on main ground apparently of ‘Iraq’s maintenance, under the Treaty of Erzerum, of her rights to the whole waters of the Shatt-al-Arab that there appears to me real danger of serious com plications arising at any time along ‘ Iraq Persian frontier. It is suggested that His Britannic Majesty’s Government might consider whether affairs have not reached such a stage as to make it advisable to bring to the attention of the Council of the League under League Covenant (Paragraph 2 of Article 11), all circumstances now affecting good understanding between Persia and ‘Iraq notably refusal of Persia to recognise ' Iraq in spite of recognition by League, demand for judicial privileges for Persians, demand for rectification of frontier and demand for prolongation of period within which persons may opt for Persian nationality. If His Britannic Majesty’s Government were inclined towards this step, and before the suggestion was taken any further, the ‘Iraq Government would, of course, have to be consulted. Extract from despatch No. 183 dated the 20th of April, 1928, from Sir Robert Clive, K.C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty s Minister, Teheran, to Sir Austen Chamberlain, K.G., M.P., Foreign Office, London. 5. It was not until I received this morning telegram No. 8 f rom His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz which I have repeated t° you under No 106 tha ^ learnt of a further serious feature of the matter, the sending o a &lt; to stop H.M.S. “ Enterprise ” in mid-stream otf the port of Abadan I havejhe honour to enclose a copy of the official protest wine i am at c t ®‘ j Government on this point as stated in my telegram V the waters of have taken this opportunity of reaffirming the 'g ®of I U h , conseque nt the Shatt-al-Arab up to low water mark y^C^Xiut lining within Persian corollary that ships may moor alongside the jetty - -i • cn r jj Dobbs’ jurisdiction. This will; I trust, meet the main point raised m Sir G. telegram to the Colonial Office of the 19th Apn .British Legation, Teheran. 20th April, 1928. Monsieur le Gerant, His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz lias reported to me that when H.M.S. “ Enterprise ”, of whose visit to Abadan I had the honour to notify Your Excellency in my semi-official letter of the 15th April, reached the neighbourhood of that port, a Persian Customs launch was despatched to stop hei in mid-stream. 2. I must emphatically protest against this action of the Persian authori ties. Since, under treaty the low water line on the Persian side of the Shatt-al- Arab constitutes the frontier line between ‘ Iraq and Persia, the Persian authorities have no kind of right to interfere in any way with shipping on the ‘ Iraq side of this line and the action of the Customs launch constitutes a direct infringement of the rights of ‘ Iraq. I understand that the Customs acted under direct orders from the Minister of Finance. 3 . I take this opportunity of pointing out that in consequence of the posi tion of the frontier at low-water mark any jetty at Abadan or elsewhere on the Persian bank of the Shatt-al-Arab projects into ‘ Iraq territorial waters. Any ship therefore lying at any such jetty is incontestably within ‘ Iraq territorial waters and the Persian authorities have no jurisdiction over her nor right to interfere with her mooring in such a position. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my high consideration. (Sd.) R. H. Clive. His Excellency, Mirza Fathullah Khan Pakravan, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Teheran. Copy. 58355/28. Sir, Colonial Office, Downing Street, 3rd May, 1928. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Amery to refer to Colonial Office letters No. 58355/28 of the 20 th, 26th and 28th of April forwarding copies of telegrams which have been received from the High Commissioner for ‘ Iraq on the subject of the recent incidents at Abadan, and to suggest, for the consideration of Secretary, Sir Austen Chamberlain, that a strong protest in regard to those incidents should be addressed to the Persian Government at an early date. 2 . As Sir Austen Chamberlain will have observed from Sir Henry Dobbs’ telegram No. 234 of the 23rd of April, it appears that the Persian Government have now openly challenged the findings of the 1913-14 Frontier Delimitation Commission and apparently claim the “ Thalweg ” of the Shatt-al-Arab as the frontier line between Persia and Iraq. That this claim cannot be sustained is shown in Sir H. Dobbs’ letter No. S.O. 904 of the 14th of April, addressed to Sir K. Clive, a copy of which was forwarded to Mr. Oliphant under cover of Sir J. Shuckburgh’s letter No. 58133/28 of the 28th of April. Mr. Amery considers it of great importance that this claim on the part of the Persian Government should not be allowed to pass unchallenged. I am accordingly to suggest, for Sir Austin Chambeilain s consideration, that the Persian Government should be informed in the manner proposed in the latter part of Sir H.

Mr. Secretary Amery will observe from Sir B.

In these circumstances Sir Ansten Chamberlain prefers to await the fuller report from Sir 14. Clive, mentioned in Sir H.

Clive’s telegram No. 119 of the 29th April (a copy of which is also enclosed herein), to the effect that practica y all the action taken by the Persian Minister of Finance against British interests m Southern Persia has now been reversed by the Persian Minister of the Court. 3. It appears to Sir Austen Chamberlain, however, that the incidents referred to by Sir H. Dobbs illustrate the urgent desirability, m the interests both of His Majesty’s Government and of ‘Iraq, of taking whatever steps may e pos sible to facilitate the establishment of normal relations between Persia and iiaq, and in this connexion he desires to invite the special attention o i. ^^ , suggestions contained in the Foreign Office letter of the 23rd Apn on of judicial privileges in ‘ Iraq. 4. Copies of this letter have been sent to the Admiralty, Air Ministry and Board of Trade. I am, etc., (Sgd.) Monteagle. The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office.( 22 ) Copy. No. E. 2388/2014/34. Foreign Office, S. W. 1. 24th May, 1928. Confidential. * * Sir, With reference to yonr letter No. 58355/28 of the 3rd May, and to the Foreign Office reply of the 8 th May, regarding the recent incidents at Abadan and the general relations between Persia and ‘Iraq, I am directed by Secretary Sir Ansten Chamberlain to transmit to yon, to be laid before Mr. Secretary Amery, a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Minister at Teheran, which is evidently the report to which His Majesty’s High Commissioner for ‘Iraq referred m his telegram No. 237 of the 25th April, 2. The Secretary of State has now considered in the light of^ this report, the suggestions advanced in paragraphs 2 and 3 of your letter of May 3rdfirstly, that the Persian Government should be informed that, so long as merchantmen arriving at Abadan are not allowed to moor_ alongside the jetty without special permission from the Persian Government, Persian gunboats or any other Persian vessel will not be allowed by the ‘ Iraqi Government to anchor anywhere in ‘ Iraqi territorial waters without special permission; and secondly that an inter-depart mental Conference might be held to consider the desirability of bringing the strained relations between Persia and Iraq to the notice of the Council of the League of Nations. 3. With regard to the first suggestion, the Secretary of State is advised that Article 2 of the Treaty of Erzerum, which gives Persian vessels complete liberty to navigate the Shatt-al-Arab up to the point of contact of the frontiers of Persia and ‘Iraq, must be held to give Persian merchant vessels the right to call at ‘ Iraqi ports in that area and to anchor in ‘ Iraqi national waters in addition to the right of passing over ‘Jraqi national waters to reach Persian ports. So far as merchant ships are concerned, the Iraqi Government would therefore not be justified in an attempt to prevent them from anchoring in the Shatt-al-Arab without special permission. It is consequently not open to the Iraqi Government to prevent, or impose special conditions on Persian vessels anchoring at Abadan where, though the port is Persian, the anchorage is in ‘ Iraqi national waters. 3. There is, however, a fundamental difference between the rights of a merchant ship and the rights of a Persian warship to navigate the Shatt-al-Arab. The right of navigation accorded to Persia by the Treaty of Erzerum does not include the right of using ‘ Iraqi national waters for military operations, such as the coercion of tribes on the Persian shore, and the ‘ Iraqi Government would be within their strict legal rights in refusing to allow Persian warships to anchor m the * Iraqi national waters without permission. At the same time, Persian warships have the right of passing over ‘ Iraqi national waters in order to reach the Persian port of Mohammerah. 5. The Secretary of State nevertheless considers it undesirable in the present circumstances to address a communication to the Persian Government stating that the ‘ Iraqi Government are not prepared to allow Persian warships to anchor in the Shatt-al-Arab without previous permission, even though, as stated in the preceding paragraph, such an attitude on the part of the ‘ Iraqi Government would be legally justifiable. In his opinion, any policy of reprisals and retaliation against Persia by ‘ Iraq would be inopportune, and would only tend to hinder the the establishment of friendly relations between the two countries. 6 . Similarly, with regard to the second suggestion in your letter under reply, Sir Austen Chamberlain does not at present consider it desirable to bring the state of Perso-Iraq relations before the council of the League of Nations. L® notes that, in Sir H. Dobbs’ opinion, there is a real danger of serious complications ite definite I suer, ! The at jiaglit to the Majesty's ■iM.

He recognises that the recent pohcv of the Persian Government toward Iraq, as exemplified in the Abadal ncFdents has been unfriendly, and even provocative; but whether any specific action on their part could he shown to exceed their strict legal rights is open to question ° Their insistence on the removal of the Abadan office of the Basra Port Authority from Persian soil, which is the only decision taken by the Persian Minister of Finance which has not since been reversed by his government, can scarcely be obiected to m principle; and it would be impossible to complain to the League of Nations that the Persian attitude threatens to disturb international peace without beum able to produce definite proof that Persia had exceeded her rights or acted in a warlike manner. 7. The attitude of the Persian Government towards ‘Iraq could perhaps be brought to the notice of the League of Nations m the A-nnual Report supplied by His Majesty’s Government under Article 3 of the Council’s decision of Sep tember 1924. This course would be free from the objections which, as indicated above, preclude action under Article 11 of the Covenant; but apart from the consideration that it could not in any case be taken until the time comes, next year, to present the Annual Report on ‘ Iraq for 1928, the Secretary of State is strongly averse from entering upon any anti-Persian campaign before the League Council in present circumstances. Such a campaign would only embitter Anglo- Persian relations, without improving the relations between Persia and ‘ Iraq; and Sir Austen Chamberlain feels that the primary object of His Majesty’s Government should be to secure a friendly settlement of the questions of recognition and judicial safeguards on the lines recently proposed by Sir R. Clive. If, however, conciliatory action on these lines fails to bring about a settlement and a complete deadlock is reached, he will then be prepared to reconsider the desirability of bringing the situation to the knowledge of the League. In the meantime, and in view of the considerations set forth above, it appears to him unnecessary to hold an inter-departmental conference on the subject. 8 . Copies of this letter are being sent to the Admiralty, Air Ministry, India Office, and Board of Trade. I am, etc., (Sgd.) Monteagle. The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office. 9th June 1928. •58355/28 ir, . I am directed by Mr. Secretary Amery to acknowledge ie ^ dp ^| nc -q er ^ s 'fflce letter No E. 2388/2014/34 of the 24th of May, r ®g” d ‘“° ^ sUte for th e ; Abadan and the general relations between Persia anc a arees’that in [formation of Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain t ^ proposal that Persian ie present circumstances there is no necessity to pu }_ * l or sugges- sssels should be refused permission to anchor m the ^ should be addressed on that a communication on the subject of Perso-Iraq &gt; the League of Nations. ^ ^ ^ 2. He observes, however, that in a letter written on the ^ 20th April, copy of which was enclosed in Sir R. Clive’s r ^ esp ^_p . n p ro t 0 col of 1913 had ie Persian Minister of Court stated that the Turcnever entered into force and is contested by the Persian Government. This con tention is presumably based upon the fact that the Protocol v as ire's er ratified and i cm ores the fact that that Instrument did not require ratification in order to become operative. Mr. Amery understands that it has been advanced more than once by the Persian Government and has been controverted by British representatives in Persia. It might be desirable nevertheless, in view of the tendency of oriental Governments to regard any mis-statement which passes unchallenged as having been accepted, that the opportunity should be taken to controvert it once again. 3 . I am accordingly to suggest, for the consideration of bir Austen Chamberlain, that Sir R. Clive should be instructed, if he has not already done so, to deny in categorical terms the contention in Teymourtache’s letter of the 19th of April. ^ The opportunity might also be taken to protest against the reference, in the following sentence of Teymourtache’s letter, to the Basra Port Office at Abadan as representing u une authorite malveillante a notre egard and to point out that any hostility that may have been shown in the past has not been on the side of the 4 Iraq Government who on many occasions during the last few years have gone out of their way to assist the Persian Government when in difficulties (notably on the occasion of the grain shortage in Teheran in 1925 and 1926) and have always shown themselves willing to meet the Persian Government in the matter of the establish ment of friendly relations between the two countries. I am, Sir, Your most obedient servant, (Sd.) A. J. Harding. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. No. 320 British Legation^ Gulhek, 29th June, 1928. Sir, As I had the honour to report in my telegram No. 121 of June 25th I had a long conversation that day with the Minister of the Court. I purposely had not hurried to act on the authority given me in your telegram No. 75 of June 9th to pump His Excellency as to what he meant by an u exchange of views ”, as I thought it v 7 as better not to appear too eager. 2 . As I stated in my telegram No. 110 of June 5 th my impression had been that Teymourtache wished to discuss the position that might conceivably arise in the event of Anglo-Soviet hostilities ; I still believe that on June 3 rd, the date of our conversation, he had that in mind. In the past three weeks however the Shah’s anxiety on that score has abated and I have reason to believe that the Soviet Ambassador has stated most clearly that the last thing that the Russians desire is war with England. 3. The question raised at my interview by Teymourtache was quite un expected. I had heard rumours of slight trouble on the Turco-Persian frontier with Kurdish bands but that is nothing unusual. I was unaware that the Turks had, as Te^momtache alleged, deliberately advanced their frontier posts in two or three places to the old line and were actually encouraging Turkish Kurds, whom they professed to have disarmed, to make raids into Persia. ° When I asked: Teymourtache25 whether the Turkish Government had officially sHWl iw abide by the 1913 protocol he said that they had dono Jn t ley ? ld not intend to Persian Government wished to know, therefore he ncVl a Se T er ^ 1 occa sions.

I am foiw aiding copies of this despatch to the Government of India and His Majesty’s High Commissioner for ‘ Iraq, Baghdad. I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, (Signed) R. H. Clive. The Right Honourable, Sir Austen Chamberlain, K.G., M.P., Foreign Office. P.S. line 30th. Since wniting the above 1 have seen the Prime Minister who confirmed what Teymourtache said. He told me that the Turks argued that the decisions of the Frontier Commission had no validity as they had neither been ratified by the Sultan and the Turkish Parliament nor by the Majlis. I pointed out to Mnkhber-es- Sultaneli that this argument was groundless, as it w T as^ laid down in the protocol that the decisions of the Frontier Commission would be immediately put into force, and there v T as no question of ratification. His Highness shrugged his shoulders. He is an old gentleman of w ide experience, who knows the Turks. Among many other posts he has held tiiat oi Governor of Azerbaijan.Copy of a paraphrased telegram No. 421 dated IGth August, 1928, from the High Commissioner, Baghdad, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, London. Personal. With regard to referring relations between Persia and Iracj to League of Nations, would it not be wise to reconsider the question. 1 see no hope of diminishing tension which produces incident after incident and has already led to unofficial threat by Persian Government to our Minister to repudiate 1 Iraq frontier. Unhappy situation is entirely due to Persia’s refusal to recognise Iraq despite recognition by League of Nations and to her determination to make herself unpleasant until she has forced ‘ Iraq to make concessions which she has no right to demand namely admission to judicial privileges and important rectification of frontier. If she had gone about it in different way she would have had much better chance of obtaining satisfaction. Contrast behaviour of Turkey who with every reason to he cold towards ‘ Iraq has by friendly recognition of mutual interests entirely won hearts of ‘Iraqis and although Turkey like Persia greatly dislikes exclusion of her nationals from judicial privileges she has discussed question in courteous and sympathetic fashion and with full understanding of ‘Iraq’s difficulties. I cannot believe that labour of reference to League of Nations would be greater than that involved in acrimonious discussion of constantly increasing number of incidents, repudiation of accusations by one side or other and attempts to foresee and avoid still more serious incidents.

The papers primarily consist of communications regarding the negotiations submitted to the Foreign Office by HM Ambassadors at Rome, Teheran and Baghdad, as well as comments by the India Office Political Department, the Admiralty, and representatives of the Governments of Persia, Iraq, and Italy.The negotiations concerned the frontier line along the Shatt el-Arab, the possibility of granting a Persian anchorage at Abadan [Ābādān], the rights of Persian and British warships to traverse and refuel on the river, and the proposed establishment of a Conservancy Board. Following negotiations in Geneva, Rome and Tehran, the Persian and Iraqi Governments had practically agreed on three instruments: a pact of non-aggression, to be signed by Iraq, Persia and Turkey; a treaty for the peaceful settlement of international disputes between Persia and Iraq; and a treaty of friendship, which would settle the frontier question and establish the Conservancy Board.In addition to the correspondence, the volume contains: documents circulated by the Council of the League of Nations; Reports on the Sessions of the Council submitted to the Foreign Office by C J Edmonds, Second Adviser to the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs; multiple drafts of the treaty of friendship and non-aggression treaties; and copies of notes exchanged by the Iraqi and Persian Ministers at the League of Nations. A number of these documents are written in French.The volume includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the volume by year. This is placed at the end of the correspondence (folio 1).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Committee of Imperial Defence, Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Shatt el-Arab</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Italy</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>League of Nations</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Shatt-el-Arab</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Boundary disputes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x00019c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
