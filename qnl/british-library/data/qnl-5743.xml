Frankincense, Myrrh and Bdellium. The following note has'been drawn up by Mr. I. H. Burkill, Officiating Reporter on Leonomic Products to the Government or India. It enumerates the vernacular names used in the* East for the fragrant gums known as frank incense, myrrh and bdellium, and is issued to Government officers and others who are willing to render assistance in adding to our information on this class of products. The plants .—It is desirable to know more about the plants yielding these gums and to define more accurately the extent of their distribution. For this purpose botanical specimens are needed consisting of a branch with leaves, flowers and fruits ) these should be flattened and dried between pieces of blotting paper. If the flowers or fruits are of a delicate nature they should be sent in small bottles of spirit. A note should be attached to each specimen indicating the date and place of collection, vernacular name, height and habit of the plant, the time of flowering and fruiting, the nature of soil, and elevatian at which the plant grows. The gums—l n sending samples of these it should’ be stated at what season of the year they are usually collected ; whether they exude naturally from the trees or only after incising the bark ; whether a different quality is procured from the young compared with the older plants ; and whether the gums are submitted to any special treatment before they are sent to the market. . Commercial samples of the gums or resins should also be sent showing various grades, with prices attached, and districts in which they have been collected. Much assistance would be rendered in the enquiry if correspondents would correct and •supplement the statements made in the following list. It is requested that all information and specimens be forwarded to the Reporter on Economic Products to the Government of India, 9 Indian Museum, 1, Sudder Street, Calcutta, A 1 t V2 A Note on Frankincense, Myrrh, Bdellium and some substances mixed with them in trade. We are remarkably ignorant in regard to the origin of the above named substances, of Myrrh most of all and of bdellium next; of frankincense or olibanum we know perhaps one-third of its story. Until Sir George Birdwood’s paper appeared* most writers who had written, had written amiss, and many had made very careless mistakes. So many points are there to take up that I have thought it well to remark on each name or term used in connection with these spices by itself. These remarks the reader will find arranged alphabetically below. The ports which ship these spices are all on the Gulf of Aden except Hodeida and Mekran and (for Mecca Balsam) Jiddah. The country pro ducing the spices, as far as we know it, lies behind the ports on the slopes of the mountains. Whence olibanum comes to Mekran we do not know. We believe that the range of the species of plants which yield the spices is wider than the region over which the spices are gathered; but the circum stances bringing this about are not known. It is hoped that the following 4 remarks sufficiently bring out the points upon which information is much to be desired. . Ajokt-^A name in Bedscha of Commiphora opobalsamum. ^ Akooyeelasemoon roomee, Birdwooi.—k\^\c for Mecca balsam. * Alkunduru—A name for Boswellia Carterii, Var. Anduku —The resin of Boswellia serrata. Ankua —The Abyssinian name of Commiphora Schimperi. Armenian bol —Irving says that this was a drug of Patna in a form of red oxide of iron. ' Baisa bol=Byssa bol. , Balasan Arabian, Persian and Mahratti for Mecca balsam. Balasan-ke“tel— “Hindi for Mecca Balsam. Balata bola — Mahratti for Myrrh. Balessan, Birdwood.—Egyptian for Mecca balsam. Balimtrapolam -Tamil for Myrrh. Balm of Gilead— The same as Mecca balsam. Balsamodendron Ehrenbergianum = Commiphora'opobalsamum. Balsaraodendron giIeadense=Commiphora Opobalsamum. Balsamodendron pubescens=Commiphora Stocksiana. Bander Karam=AWrc dol. 184S.

SUbs ‘ anCeS bat oi 'y and without the aroma 'On the Genus Boswellia. Trans. Lin. Soc., XXVI1(1S69), P. 3 -The following are kinds of Bdellium :— African Bdellium. Opaque Bdellium. Perfumed Bdellium or Bissabol. Indian Bdellium. African Bdellium is said to be derived from Commiphora africana in part. It probably has also other unknown sources. From what source opaque Bdellium comes is quite unknown. Formerly it was confused with Hotai gum. Perfumed Bdellium is from Commiphora Playfairii (see Bissabol). Indian Bdellium is obtained from Commiphora Mukul, etc. (see. Gugal). African Bdellium and Opaque Bdellium—Both reach Bombay from Berbera vid Aden. Becham —Arabic for Balm, and said to be used as a name for Commi phora Opobalsamum. Belaip-polam= Vellaip-polam. ' Bissabol— A very fragrant myrrh-like product, derived, one has every reason to believe, from a plant which has been considered to be a variety of Commiphora erythrasa. It is also called Habaghadi,— Fragrant Bdellium, and at times in Europe by a misnomer, Opopanax. Until 1897, when the first consignments went to Europe, all the export of Somaliland had passed across to Aden and Makalla and thence vid Bombay to China. The word Bissabol means Buffalo Myrrh, and contrasts the product with Hira bol. It is given to buffaloes to promote secretion of milk. Boe-Jahudan (Persian) = Bol, Bola— In Sanskrit and in India—Myrrh, and found in combination in such word as Bissabol. Eolam—Cinghalese for Myrrh. The word became/Waw in the Madras Presidency. Bol-i-armanie —See Armenian Bol. Boswellia Ameero, Balf. f .—A balsam-yielding tree of Socotra. It is not stated if it is commercially used. Boswellia Bhau-dajiana, Birdwood—k tree of the Ahl mountains in Somaliland, called Mohr-add and yielding a part of the frankincense of commerce. Bentley and Trimen, although they do not precisely say . that the plant is the same as B. Carterii, leave the impression that they cannot positively separate it. However other botanists have done so. Boswellia Carterii, Birdwood —Is a tree of both sides of the Gulf of Aden which grows to a moderate height. Either it is very variable or else the name Carterii has been too widely applied and that some of the divergent specimens so far collected do not properly belong to the species; if the latter is the case, then the true B. Carterii is the tree which grows on the Somaliland coast and was collected by Playfair and Dr. Gray under the vernacular name of Mohr madoiv. The plantV 4 \ collected by Dr. Carter near Merbat and Ras Fartak under the verna cular name of Maghrayt d’sheehaz must then obtain a new distinctive specific name. So far the evidence for separation is that the Arabian tree appears to be smaller than the Somali tree, and to have the stamens inserted at a higher level on the outside of the disc. There is also a third plant which like the last may require a distinctive specific name. Playfair obtained it under the name of Mohr viadow from the Somali coast, and it is No. 6 of the Flora of Tropical Africa. There is every reason for believing that all three forms or species or whatever they be, yield commercial frankincense. Boswellia elongata, ifo//./.—A balsam-yielding tree of Socotra. It is not stated if it is commercially used. Boswellia Frereana, Birdwood — A tree fifteen feet high (possibly higher) of the Ahl mountains in Somaliland occurring plentifully near Bunder Murayha and called Yegaar. It yields a resin which is not olibanum ; and which is said to be collected by the Abardagahala tribe of Somalis after incising the trees in July and August. Boswellia Hildebrandtii, Engl .—Used as a medicine under the namelof Gekar in East Africa. Details unknown. Boswellia neglecta, Engl .—A tree of the Ahl mountains of Somaliland, named as a source of Balsam, Boswellia papyrifera, Hochst. —A tree of Abyssinia and surrounding countries, generally believed until 1869 to be the source of frankincense. It is far from disproved that the species cannot yield frankincense, but it is not proved that it yields any. Boswellia serrata, Roxb. —The Indian tree which yields Salai gum and which simply because people had got it into their heads that such species are produced in India, was said to yield olibanum until the middle of the last century. 7 Boswellia socotrana, Balf. /.—A Balsam-yielding tree of Socotra. It is not slated if it is commercially used. Boswelia thurifera v Roxb.='Q. serrata. Bschiamed—l he Jipename of Commiphora quadricincta, according to Schwemfurth. The word appears to have something in common with Becham (Besajn) the Arabic for Balm. Byssabol. ' ' '' : “* oumc to,uuslon 10 Chaddash, Chaddesch— See Khaddash. Chinaibol— The Siamese balsam used in Calcutta and Bombay; not Myrrh. Chittu— Kanarese for Boswellia serrata. Ccmmipbora ahyssinica, shrub of Abyssinia, Erythraa an&lt; South Arabia, said by Schweinfurth to yield true Myrrh. E M Holme* dissents. It is useless to marshall the pros and cons for either view a* isaryliCommiphora Berryi,«, Engl.—k small tree of the hills of S. India yielding a gum-resin. It is also cultivated for fencing in the Madras and Bombay Presidencies. Commiphora erythraea, Engl—A shrub of the coast of Soma liland and of Erythrsea with two varieties, one of which the Somali variety yields Bissabol, Habaghadt or Perfumed Bdellium. Further study alone will show if the Somali plant is rightly referred to C. •erythraea. The plant of the coast of Erythrsea yields Gafal or Kafal wood. Commiphora Hildebrandtii, Engl—k plant of Somaliland known as Hagr-moeddii) thought possibly a source of Myrrh. Commiphora Kataf, Engl.—An Arabian tree with red fragrant heartwood,— Kataf wood, which was formerly said to be derived from c. erythraea. Kataf wood is chiefly sold in Egypt. Commiphora Mulcul, Engl. —A tree of the drier countries north and east of the Arabian sea. Yielding Gugal or Indian Bdellium. Commiphora Myrrha, Engl.—A prickly shrub of the coastal plain (Tehama), west of Mecca, and of Yemen and of the west slopes of the plateau of Arabia and also of Somaliland, formerly believed to yield Myrrh but latterly said by Schweinfurth to be quite scentless and useless. Weisner in 1900 said that it yields Fad hit Myrrh, but he is most uncritical ; Schweinfurth is indeed an infinitely better guide. Yet E. M. Holmes finds reason to doubt either Schweinfurth’s statement or the identity of the Tehama, Yemen and Somaliland plants ; and until further study (which best of all would be done on the spot) may have been prosecuted, we must remain in complete doubt. In Arabia the plant is called Ugge-, in Somaliland Didin or Didthin. The beginning of the statement that it yields Myrrh was with Nees who carelessly neglected the ‘-possibly (yields Myrrh)” of Hemprich’s statement and wrote “ yields Myrrh.” Commiphora Opobalsamum, Engl.—A spineless scraggy shrub of the deserts of Arabia near the coast of the neighbourhood of Mecca and of Somaliland, formerly asserted to yield Myrrh ; latterly asserted generally to yield Mecca balsam and not Myrrh. Engler thinks that C. Opobalsamum was the shrub formerly cultivated at Cairo, and in the Jordan Valley ; but Theophrastus remarks that the Myrrh tree is spiny—a point against this view for it was the Myrrh shrub which was cultivated. There does not seem to be any cultivation of Myrrh now but all gathered Is from wild trees in forests, C. Opobalsamum is of wide distribution but the Mecca district alone seems to be the source of the balsam. The tree is called Bescham in Yemen, Majok and Ajokt in Bedscha and Dasseno in Somaliland. E. M. Holmes says that he is satisfied that Mecca balsam comes from this plant. Two varieties of it exist. Commiphora Playfairii, Hook. f .—A thorny tree of Somaliland near Cape Gardafui which yields resin. Commiphora quadricincta, Schwein. f. —A plant of Erythrsea which is known to be tapped ; but what is the extract and what becomes of it is not known. Its name in Tipe is Bschiamed ; and that name seems to imply that it yields a Myrrh or similar substance.Commiphora Roxburghii —A tree of Assam and Eastern Bengal which yields a gum. Formerly it was said to yield commercial gum Gugal] and the old confusion of this species with C ; Stocksiana which gave origin to the statement, appears still to persist in all literature on the subject. Commiphora shmhariensis, Schwcin. f ex Holmes—k shrub of Massowah suggested as a source of Myrrh. Commiphora Schimperi, EngL—k small tree of Abyssinia and Yemen called Ankua or Oanka in Abyssinian. In 1896 on account of the statements of Schweinfurth this plant was reported to be believed to be the source of African Myrrh. In 1899 E, M. Holmes stated that the gum which this plant yields is not a Myrrh. Engler in 1900 followed Schweinfurth in stating it to be a source of Myrrh, naming the plant Gala/ of Yemen. It is to be noted that, its Abyssinian name is given also to C. africana, If this plant should yield Myrrh, and C. africana Bdellium, that they should have the same name is most unlikely. On the whole the evidence is against its being a source of Myrrh. Commiphora socotrana, Engl.—A shurb of Socotra said to give a gum not to be distinguished from Luban Maiti. Commiphora Stocksiana— A tree cf Beluchistan and parts of Scinde with fragrant branches and foliage but yielding a tasteless inodorous gum called Gugal, said to be used for adulteration of the more valuable gum resins. It is also medicinal. Formerly this tree was confused with C. Roxburghii. Dasseno —A Somali name for Commiphora Opobalsamum. Duph~A modern Bombay market name equivalent to Kishar Kundar. Didin, Didthin— Somali name of a Myrrh tree. The plants collected under these names by Hildebrandt and Wykeham Perry were referred to Commiphora Myrrha, but if C. Myrrha does not yield Myrrh, then they must be something else. Duhnul balasan— Said to be a Bombay name for Mecca balsam. Dukak Kundur— A name of Mahomedan writers in India for dust of olibanum. East Aden Myrrh —The same as Fadhli Myrrh. East Indian Myrrh—A trade name of Bissabol. Esesh—A Bombay name of olibanum in the widest sense. Fadhli Myrrh— Schweinfurth says identical with Yemen Myrrh but Dyer disagrees. } False Myrrh=Gum Gugal. Gafal — The same as Kafal, Gandarassa— Cinghalese for Myrrh. Gandha-rasaha— Sanskrit for Myrrh.

It looks as if the Kataf th6 Same ^ Kata ^ whlch is the name referred to Commiphora B be m also Roxbhuf S.M 3 i 1 f a and , C - , Mukul and adulterant of Myrrh, and is used as a medicine .' 3 ATubsmtce^very like7 Gugal comes to India from Arabia mixed with Myrrh. This latter is not traced to its origin. Guggulu —(Sanskrit) = Gum Hotai— Gum of C. Playfairii, Gunda beroza- Gum-resin of Boswellia serrata (Gundha-birosa or Gundab ferozah) often only before drying, after which it is called Sukha- biroza, but Mohideen Sheriff says by misapplication. Habaghadi = iTyrjaiW. The word means female Myrrh. Hab-el-Balasan, Habbul-balasan —Arabian and Mahratti name for fruits of Balm of Gilead. Lisboa wrongly refers the name to Com miphora Berryi. Irving writes the word Hub-ool-balsam in his Materia Medica of Patna. Hab-bul balasan, Habulas balesa —Mahratti for Mecca balsam corruption of Hab-el-balasan. The name should be verified. Hadramaut Myrrh —Dyer’s name for Myrrh from Makal and Aden. Hagr moeddu— The Somali name of Commiphora Hildebrandtii Compare Mohr madow. Hebbakhade, =Afai$a£/Wz\ Hirabol, Heerabol —Hindi and Bengali for Myrrh, contrasted with Byssabot. Hoboli— Abyssinian for Myrrh. Hodaidia jebeli— Dyer gives this name after Fliickiger and Hanbury for Myrrh from N. W. Yemen. Hotai resin. —A soapy gum-resin yielded by Commiphora Playfairii. It is called Dukh by Hindus in Muscat and Diji, Dijaj or Dijjaj in Arabia. It is used in the place of soap. Jatayu (Chinghalese) = /. Kafal wood —Said to’ be fragrant heartwood of Commiphora eryth- nca-—the variety of the coast of Erythrgea. The name is said by Engler to be applied also to C. abyssinica. Karam, Karambol. —Mahratti for African Myrrh. Kashfa. —The same at Kishar Kundur. Kataf wood, —The fragrant heartwood of Commiphora Kataf. Katel. —Said by Wiesner to be a Bombay name for Mecca Balsam. Evi dently a muddle derived from misunderstanding the expression Balasan-ka-tel. Kerbeta, Kerobeta. —Abyssinian for Myrrh tree. Khaddash.— Schweinfurth uses the word as the Arabic for Myrrh, Engler takes it as the Abyssinian name for Commiphora abyssinica. Khafli .—The same as Kishar Kundur. Kishar Kundur. —A name of Mahomedan writers in India for the bark of the frankincense tree with scraps of olibanum on it. Kou-shikaha (Sanskrit)=Gzz^a/. Kundur Madahraj. —A name of Mahomedan writers in India for tears of olibanum made by shaking the moist gum-resin in a basket until the particles agglomerate.Rundur Unsa or female frankincense—A name of Mahomedan writers in India for pale yellow tears of olibanum. Kundur zakar or male frankincense—A name of M ahomedan writers in India for deep yellow tears of olibanum. Kungli.— Tamil for Boswellia serrata ( ? resin or tree). Kunarakkam-pishin.— Tamil for olibanum. Luban aungure. —A trade name of olibanum in Aden, which is derived from the port of Bundur Aungure and from the country of the Abardagai- hala Somalis. Luban Bedowi. —A trade name used by Somalis for olibanum which is said to be derived from the same Somali plants as Luban Shehen. The Indian Museum has two very diverse specimens so named ; one is cor rectly an olibanum and is just like Z&gt;Aw/&gt;—the other is not oliba num but benzoin. The latter specimen is one of the oldest in the Museum and it is not possible now to find out how the misnomer arose, though one may conjecture that it arose in the bazaars of Bombay whence the specimen came. The former specimen does not seem to be character istic of Luban Bedowi, but to be low grade bark scrapings. Luban Berbera.— A trade name used in Aden for olibanum—-the conr- monest kind—which is collected by the Aial Yunus and Ail Hamed Somalis and is largely used by the Arabs. This olibanum is very dark in colour and different from the others here named. Luban Maiti. —The resin of Boswellia Frereana which is used in the east for chewing like mastic. It smells of Citron. Fliiokiger and Hanbury think it the original Elemi: there are other Elemis known. One writer says that it is collected by Abardagahala Somalis and shipped from Bunder Maiti—another that most of the resin is shipped from the port of Karam to Egypt and to the Red Sea ports. At times it reaches Trieste or London. It also reaches Bombay, though rarely, and is called Pandhri Esesh or Pandkri Luban. The pieces are stalactitic often&gt; but not always ; and it can be told from olibanum by not turning white in water. Luban Maiti contains no gum. Luban Makur. —A trade name in Aden for olibanum, which is derived from the ports of Ras Rurree, Khor Bundur, Alhohu, Bunder Maryah and Bunder Khassoom and from near Cape Gardafui. It is collected chiefly in March, April and May and sent across the Gulf of Aden to Sheher and Makalla. Luban Maiti. Luban Morbat —The same as Luban Sheher i. Morbat being a port on, the Arabian coast. Luban Mushika —The same as Luban Berbera. Luban nankur— A trade name of olibanum in Aden, the same as Luban Aungure. Laban Sheheri —A trade name used in connection with olibanum, but not yet accurately defined. The name probably originates from the mart of Sheher in Arabia, and may have meant in the first place the olibanum exported thence ; but it seems to be used on the Somali coast. Bird- wood declares on the authority of Playfair that the bulk of the oli banum which is exported under this name from the Somali coast is derived from Boswellia Carterii and B. Bhau-dajiana and thataccording to Vaughan Arabia supplies a part of it from Boswellia Carterii, var. (vern.) Maghrayt d'sheehaz. Maghrayt d’sheehaz —The Maharas name of the tree Boswellia Car terii which yields frankincense, Sheehciz being the frankincense. Mai-sakshi (Tamil) = &lt;2^/. Majok— A Bedscha name of Commiphora Opobalsamum. Makker— The Abyssinian name of Boswellia papyrifera. Mecca balsam or Mor balasan —A pale green half-fluid balsam with a powerful odour, much used in Cairo, as a medicine. Pilgrims take it to Constantinople whence only it gets into European stores. Some is said to be shipped to Bombay as Balasan-ka-tel or Duhnul balasan. It is of two qualities, one said to have oozed naturally also to be very rare and never to be seen in Europe, the other got by a process of dis tillation—less valuable and commoner. Commiphora Opobalsamum is suggested as the plant yielding it. Meenaharma —A Bombay name for Opaque Bdellium. Meetiya— Mahratti for Arabian Myrrh, which Bombay dealers say is true Myrrh, and also for Siam Myrrh. Mhaisabol, Mhaisa gugal —Gugal gum from Commiphora Mukul (? always). Molmol, Mulmul— Somali name of a Myrrh derived from the tree Didin. Mohr madow —The Somali name of one (or two) species of Boswellia yielding frankincense, which is at present placed as a variety of Bo.S- wellia Carterii. Mohr meddhu-Mohr madow. Morr or Murr— Written (not spoken) Arabic for Myrrh. Moqle arzaq —See Mukul-i-azrak. Morr balasan —The Arabic name for Mecca Balsam, Mukul, Moql— An Arabic name for the tree yielding bdellium, (Commi phora Mukul), and also used by some writers as equivalent to gum Gugal. Mukul-i-arabi— A Mahomedan name for a rich red brown form of the gum Gugal (Indian Bdellium). What it exactly is I do not know. Mukul-i-azrak— A Mahomedan name for a reddish form of the gum Gugal (Indian Bdellium). What it exactly is I do not know. Mukul-i-yahud— A Mahomedan name for a yellowish form of the gum of Gugal (Indian Bdellium). What it exactly is I do not know. Mullu-kilurei— Tamil name for Commiphora Berryi. W[\i\m\i\=Molmol. Muru— A Swahili word which looks like the Arabic Morr; but the subs tance so designated has either been ill described or wrongly identified with Myrrh. Myrrh, Murr, Morr, Bol, Hirabol (in contradistinction to Byssabol) The origin of Myrrh is obscure. It comes into the market from the ports of Arabia and the opposite coasts of Africa and in trade classed by origin we have :— ( Somali Myrrh,Fadhli Myrrh or East Aden Myrrh or Arabian Myrrh. Yemen Myrrh. Further names exist such as Turkey Myrrh and Red Zanzibar Myrrh. Both these are London names for Myrrh re-exported thither from Bom bay, Turkey Myrrh being always best picked Myrrh. Neither Zanzibar nor Turkey have anything to do with Myrrh except as buyers of it and the names are irrational. Somali Myrrh appears to come in largest quantity from Murayhan to the sea coast at Bunder Murrayha. Yemen Myrrh is said by Defiers to come chiefly from the district of Suda north-west of Sana, and to reach the sea in large quantity at Hodeida. Fadhli or Arabian Myrrh is of at least two sorts; whether of one origin and the difference due to circumstances of collection, or not, we cannot say. Schweinfurth said that Fadhli and Yemen Myrrh are identicah The statement is not quite proved yet. There is something brought to Berbera from the Ogaden country, but I have not been able to ascertain what it is. And there are, it has been said, two Myrrhs and two Myrrh trees in the country to the west of the straits of Babelmandeb. There has also been in the Bombay market, Myrrh from Persia of quite unrecorded origin. Aden is a large mart for Myrrh, and so is Makalla. Much thence goes to Bombay, some direct to Europe, and a very little to America. The Myrrh that reaches Bombay is classed in Bombay into Meetiya —said to be Arabian. Karambol —said to be African. The latter sells at much more than the former. Karambol is that which sells in London as Turkey Myrrh. At some time on the course of its journey Myrrh has to be picked ; the impurities which are then removed are Opaque bdellium, African bdel lium and tasteless gum of several sorts. Milburn mentions these as im purities in his “ ” of 1813, and they occur now-a- days as then. Unpicked Myrrh reaches London. Habaghadi, olibanum and Mecca balsam do not seem to occur as impurities, nor Myrrh as impurities of them. Habaghadi comes, if not from a country producing Myrrh, from one bordering such a country. Olibanum comes possibly from further east than Fadhli Myrrh, while Mecca balsam is said only to be collected near Mecca. We know so little of the exact regions from which Myrrh comes that we cannot gauge the chances of these products being mixed in collection. irxyua is most ooscure. commiphora Myrrha was hrst named as it, then rejected, and now some authorities would re instate it as the source of at any rate one kind of Myrrh. C. abyssinica - ^ r -Sltnphnfoha has been suggested as a source, but hardly accepted jet. C. Hildebrandtn has also been suggested, so has C. Opobalsa- mum, C. samhariensis and C, Schimperi, Myrrh is described as obtained in two ways, (1) by incising the bark of the tree and collecting what has run out, and (2) by boiling the twies Wp in aVe f l n Wate u’ We really know nothin g about the latter proces^s. 1, d °. not . k ' 0 ^ the season of the year, nor any details; but the^time of collecting is likely to be before the rains begin. 0an afrka A na a^d C.TbyssmTcal' Commi P hora Schimperi and C.ka 1 1 Olibanum or Frankincense. —Is known to be derived from species of Boswellia, one of which is named B. Carterii and another B. Ehau- da-jiana. We do not know from how many more species it is obtained ; nor are we quite sure that all the specimens which have been named B. Carterii are rightly so called, for they differ from each other to such aii extent. It is said that the best frankincense is drawn from young trees and that the old trees only yield quite an inferior product. Theophrastus and Arriarb among the old writers, are the most explicit on the subject of Frankincense. They, between them locate the chief country producing it as the mountains back from the coast between Makalla and Ras Fartak and the opposite coast from Ras Fiel to Gardafui, the latter coast for the best. This is just the area from which we know the gum resin to come. It changes hands on the coast at different ports and gets trade names from them : these names are as follows Luban Sheheri. Luban Morbat. Luban Aungure. Luban Markur. Luban Berbera. There is also Luban bedowi.

E, P* No. 4 .REPORT On the working of the Office of the Reporter on Economic Pro- dticts to the Government of India, during the year 1008-09. The Office remained in my charge throughout the year. Mr. R. Abbey-Yates continued to work as Super- Personnei. intendent of Ledgers and Mr. A. A. Blyth as Head Clerk. At the end of December, 1908, the services of the temporary clerks in the Ledger Branch were dispensed wuth on the completion of the work of arranging files for which they had been engaged. I made the following tours:— (i) May 4th to 14th, 1908 to Lucknow to report for the Provincial Touvs ' Government upon the economic collection in their local Museum, to Saharanpur and to Simla; {ii) July 29th to August 8 th to Pusa and Mirzapur in connection with jute and lac; (m) August 18th to 29th to various places in the Jalpaiguri District collecting information about Curcumas and early rains vegetables; (iv) September 9th to October 26th to Bombay to collect products in its bazars, and to the Districts of Nimar and Aihraoti studying Rusa oil grass; (y) October 23rd to 27th to Pusa in connec tion with jute experiments; (yi) November 27th to December 20th along the Irrawaddy from Mandalay southwards collecting infor mation about Leguminous crops. In all 111 days were spent on tour aw r ay from Calcutta. This amount approximates to my aver age and is all that was permitted by my administrative responsibili ties as Reporter on Economic Products and Superintendent of the Indian Museum, Industrial Section. I learned enough on my tour in the Melghat, to justify the preparation of a short preliminary note BestlUs - 0 n Rusa and the other oil-grasses distilled ’there: I am able to show, what all the Herbarium botanists of the world could not show from their dried specimens, how widely these varieties, Sofia and Motia, of Cymbopogon Martini differ. They occupy different but contiguous areas, and evidently are favoured by different conditions such as would make the cultivation of both together difficult. Where they meet they hybridise sparingly. Thispreliminary note will be published by the Asiatic Society of Bengal. As the study of lemon oil grasses is under continuation, the directly economic observations of this tour are being withheld until the whole subject can be presented complete. In the bazars of Bombay I obtained a great deal of information. I made extensive collections of indigenous drugs there, and they are under elaboration along with the like collections mentioned in my last report. Difficulties met w r ith in this work drive me to study very specially the plants of the Ginger and Haldi family: so many un-nameable roots belonging to it having been found in the collections. The work on jute published in the Agricultural Ledger No. 6 of 1907 is being followed uj) by selection experiments under the direct supervision of my co-author Mr. R. S. Finlow. Together we planned the experiments, which are being conducted at Pusa. Wild jute was found to be particularly plentiful in Lower Birma in the country near the Hmawbi farm; that it should grow thus near Hmawbi gives one argument favourable for the cultural experiments to be undertaken there. By the tour which I undertook in Burma, accompanying the Director of Agriculture, the 'work of amplifying and correcting my ad interim report on Burmese pulses was commenced. Mr. MacKenna and I will probably require two years for our joint voik before publication is possible. The ad interim report was printed for circulation but not published. 1 have no more remarks to make regarding the year’s tours. After eight years of touring, I find that the exigencies of my work have led me most of all up and down the two Bengals, secondly about the east side of the Punjab, thirdly in the lower country of Burma, and much less in other parts of India. I wish in future tt0Se PartS ° f India Vhi0h 80 f ” 1 bee. The collections of products made during the year run to 2,436 Collection oi Products. numbers of which eight hundred and nine at the request of th e ° Adm “ istrati ™ Officers Ue SupeLtendent of thT Za ° Bot ^ ^ one hundred and seven from blcfr ^Zw; 118 ’f Ca p !CUtta ’ mental Gardens and Farms mW • ?

Hooper in the Indian Trade Journal, 1908, April 2nd. Almost ready for publication at the end of the year were reports on Indian Pens, on Tamarisk manna, on the drugs Astukhudus and Mishmi Tita, on the composition of Indian rices and on Motia and Sofia grasses. These have all gone to Press at the date of writing. A Report on Fish Oil by Mr. D. Hooper has been handed over to Dr. N. Annandale for publication. The chief of investigations in hand are recorded in the notes on pages 7-17 below: my remarks here in l^ne of tnvesngauons. preface to them on the economic work of my Office will therefore be short. I count it my chief duty at present to complete the scheme, which Sir George Watt pushed so far, of * I include unofficial publication of work done on material in the collection of the Reporter on Economic Products. fl(jLn&gt;*j^ to*- N &gt;39-- 1 2,000-7-08... C..L, ..a i obtaining, for reference and research, specimens of all India’s economic products; at the same time I am elaborating plans for exhibiting the chief of them more fully .than now m the Indian Museum by withdrawing to store rooms the unimportant. The unimportant must be kept for research but need not be made educational. In research I am concentrating efforts on those subjects for which no specialists are provided in the Agricultural, Forest and other Departments. I am in most satisfactory touch with the first named Department, and have to my profit in 'this direction, been made an official member of the Board of Agriculture. I hope to get into the same satisfactory touch with the newer Forest Research Institute. The re-arrangement of work caused by the establishment of these Departments has made to disappear from my programme of enquiries, such heads as cotton, sugar-cane, and timbers for matches. Instead of giving attention to subjects such as these I am largely occupying my time in the identification and working out of products of minor use; drugs take up much time, and so do the less-known oils, indigenous dyes, etc. Mr. Hooper is engaged in establishing tests for the identification in the chemical laboratory of all manner of Indian oils: this survey is nearing completion now. The necessity of it was forced upon us by frequently receiving oils from bazars purporting to be quite other than they proved to be. It is probable that we may follow this work up by some study of the extensive adulteration practised in certain Indian ports. x J ^ ^ 5 jjj me Kindness of the Superintendent of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Calcutta, a piece of land was put at my service whereon I grew a number’of samples in order to study the races botanically. The seeds were sown after having been carefully graded and sorted by size and colour, the intention being to connect the appearance of the seed and of the plants with the strength of the poison present. Much more work is yet required. The kindred enquirv into Burmese pulses has already been mentioned. The edible Leguminosce as a whole may be said to be under study in my Office. Work akin to this, which is being pushed is that rm 7 r/Tt t ^ 0f , 139 P IaUte befn PW wh C re aid o lull stock: for thrs list additions are being sought and informaWood and the School of Pharmacology in Cambridge. For the better study of the poison of Coriaria I am helping Mr. P. Lascelles Ward to obtain material to be worked at in New Zealand. A second report of the Indigenous Drugs Committee is in the Press. I have been much annoyed during the past year to find that on several occasions identic letters have Correspondence. been sent to the head of a related depart ment and to myself. The enquirers, in title responsible people, have no right to resort to devices which lead to the waste of the time of one department, even though in doubt as to which depart ment they ought to address: in all the cases which came to my notice the duplicate letter of enquiry reached me by transference from the other Office after I had sent a reply to the letter which came direct. During the past financial year 2,719 letters were received and 3,143 letters were issued. Of the out-going letters 433 gave infor mation to enquirers and 365 asked for specific information upon economic products. The work in the Ledger Branch is satisfactory. The ledger files occupy 1,834 boxes. Files have been lent to a number of Officers in various parts of India interested in special enquiries. Economic Products were supplied to correspondents as follows : — Ledgers. Products outgoing. Imperial Institute, London ...... Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Mr. E. H. Holmes, London Professor T. B.

Reporter on Economic Products to the Government of India. 1st July 1909.REVIEW OF PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATIONS AT PRESENT IN HAND. Gums and mucilages. Agar-Agar (1897-98, No. 78). The mucilaginous sea-weed reported a year ago as found in considerable quantities in the Rangoon bazars proves to be Catanella impudica, J. Ag. : the Burmese call it Kyauk pewint. An analysis of it is given in Mr. Hooper’s section of the new Annual Report of the Industrial Section of the Indian Museum. This is the first sea-weed found in any quantities in the bazars of India. They are indeed not common round our coasts, apparently because our rivers carry so much mud into the sea as to make the water too turbid for their growth. We have consequently little chance of deriving from sea-weeds the profitable industry that Japan has, where, as said by Mr. Hugh M. Smith, Deputy United States Fish Commissioner, in his report on the sea-weed industries of Japan, they “are among the most valuable of the aquatic resources and conduce largely to the prominent rank attained by the fisheries of that country.” Vegetable isinglass or Agar-Agar and sea-weed glue are the chief products made in Japan. Anogeissus latifolia, Wall .—Dhava gum (1908, No. 193). Particu lars regarding this gum have been collected personally; and a sample adequate for chemical examination has also been obtained. Ferula spp. and Dorema spp—Asafcetida (1908, No. 194). Progress has been made with the enquiry on the nature and origin of these gums. At present however it is premature to make any report. Odina Wodier, Roxb.—Gum (1896-97, No. 62). There is a great variability in the appearance of this gum ; some samples being clear and light in colour, while others are almost black and insoluble. The en quiry in order to explain the causes of this difference will be continued. Canarium spp. (1909, No. 224). The chemical constants of resins of various species of Canarium have been taken by Mr. Hooper and the results published by him in the Agricultural Ledger No. 3 of 1908-09 on Pwe-nyet. Lac (1908, No. 196). The enquiry which has been undertaken to ascertain what ultimately useful part, if any, the admixture of rosin plays in the manufacture of shell-lac, is in progress. It is apparent that more refinement is still necessary in our methods of chemically deter-8 mining the amount of rosin in a mixture of rosin and shell-lac. There fore the chemical constants of crude lac are first of all being examined, as the success of the work depends on the accuracy of the methods of analysis used. Mangifera iridica, Linn .—Mango gum (1907, No. 174). No samples, that are known to be genuine, have been found to be free from a considerable admixture of resins. Pinus spp.—Turpentine (1895-96, No. 36). Enquiry is in progress at the Imperial Institute. Pinus spp.—Rosin (1902, No. 36). Rosin has been sent to the Im perial Institute from the same places as the turpentine. Pwe-nyet wax (1904, No. 140). The enquiry has been completed by the publication of the Agricultural Ledger No. 2 of 1908-09. Rubber. Ficus elastica, Roxb .—Assam Rubber (1901, No. 66 ). Further attempts will be made to get information on the rubber coming down the Koladan river. Manihot Glaziovii, Muell.-Arg .—Ceara rubber (1908, No. 197). Some analyses have been made at the Imperial Institute of rubber which did not pass through my hands. The results are however recorded in my office and they will be used if, as seems probable, a report is called for on the potentialities of Ceara rubber in India. Chrozophora verbascifolia, Rows.—Tanoom (1908, No. 201). Knox, G^uU-ftt Koweit, in 1906 called my attention to this plant as a source of oil which could be used for ghi. So poisonous are the plants allied to Chrozophora and some of the Chrozophoras themselves that I determined to experiment first of all with seeds which Mr. Knox kindly supplied. I used rats and pigeons. Rats seemed to eat the seeds gr ® edli f &amp; n d without being inconvenienced : pigeons would not eat them willingly, but when forced to take shelled seeds in small quantities no m resulted That the seeds are free from poison to these animals ppears probable ; but more experiments are wanted. Unfortunately ^ ^ b “ d -P either in chS exammation or m these experiments. I have asked the Director of ^gnculture, Punjab, to raise for me a further supply of Seed. S9 Industrial Oils. Amoora Rohituka, W. &amp; A—Oil (1895-96, No. 33). The oil of this tree is still under study. Bassia spp.—Fats (1907, No. 181). I have received from the Im perial Institute a report on these fats. The fat of Bassia butyracea is therein stated to contain a high percentage of unsaponifiable matter and to be possibly suitable for edible purposes and perhaps valuable for candle making. The first use is of course confirmed by our knowledge that it is at times used for adulterating ghi. The fat of Bassia latifolia, the report says, should be valuable for edible purposes if well prepared, or if hot pressed for candle making ; and the same remark is applied to the fat of B. longifolia. Professor Dunstan has asked for further material in order to make a complete chemical examination ; and this material is being supplied to him. To M. de Caluwe of the Service des Agronomes de TPtat, Belgium, I am sending seeds for an enquiry upon their admixture in cattle food. Brassica spp.—Mustard or Sarson (1908, No. 200). An attempt is being made to ascertain the relation of London trade names and other trade names to races grown in India. Calophyllum tcmentosum, Wight.—Keena oil (1895-96, No. 33 ). Professor Dunstan has reported upon the oil of this seed, which was ob tained for him last year. He thinks that the unfavourable results are in part due to bad methods of extracting the oil. We are now obtaining the seed in order to extract the oil carefully for a fresh examination. Diospyros Embryopteris, Pm.—Oil (1895-96, No. 33 ). A sample of oil is required for examination. Eruca sativa, Taramira seed (1907, No. 182). The seeds are to be examined at the Imperial Institute for the nature of the oil that they yield. Litsaea polyantha, Jwss.—Oil from seeds (1895-96, No. 33 ). Oil from the seeds is required. Ricinus communis, Linn.—Castor oil (1898-99, No. 94 : 1902, No. 39). Material is nearly ready for a revision of the Dictionary article on this product. * Schleichera trijuga, Macassar oil (1908, No. 223). My oflice some years ago fully ascertained the yield of oil that this seed gives :10 the other constituents of the seed we did not investigate. But Professor Dunstan has asked for material to do that, and 28 lbs. of seed have been Xylia dolabriformis, to&amp;.-Pyinkado oil (1895-96, No. 33) The seeds yield 19‘4 per cent, of oil, which is a low proportion compared with other oleaginous seeds. They are also hard and difficult to powder and not easy to collect. The prospects of these seeds as an article of trade are not very hopeful, but considering that the tree is very abundant, it would be interesting to know more about the seeds and to ascertain the chemical nature of the oil. Seeds and oil are therefore required for examination. Boswell ia serrata, Roxb— Gum-resin (1896-97, No. 60). A further sample of the gum-resin is required. Cinnamomum spp.—Camphor (1903, No. 123). Several botanical specimens of trees allied to the camphor tree have been received from Burma, and these will be worked up when the material is more complete. Cymbopogon Martini, Stapf .—Citronella oil (1903, No. 121). The study is being prosecuted. It now stands thus :—Sofia oil and Motia oil have long been known, but how two so diverse oils could be obtained from the one species of plant was inexplicable. Even the best botanists working with herbarium specimens could not distinguish between the grass said to yield,‘Sofia’and the grass said to yield ‘Motia.’ By study in the field I have made out their differences and a preliminary report has been written on them. Further work is in progress. Byes. Assam dyes (1901-02, No. 101 ). The list of Assam dye plants re quired for scientific identification is now reduced to the following two :— Khujum perch —Manipur. Lakedema —Darrah. Baccaurea sapida, Muell.-Arg .—Dye (1901-02, No. 101) The in vestigation will be pursued. At present the use of Baccaurea’ seems to be, not as a dye, but as an auxiliary in dyeing. Morinda citrifolia, Tmw., and other species—Al-root (ISOb'-OO No 32) % An Agricultural Ledger will be prepared on the subject. ’ ' Onosma echioides, Zmn.—Alkannet (1901, tural Ledger on this dye will be published shortly. No. 45). An Agricul-Symplocos spicata, Roxb .—Dye (1901-02, No. 101). The leaves are used in dyeing not directly as a dye, but for some subsidiary function, like the leaves of Baccaurea sapida. This will be investigated. Thespesia Lampas, Dalz. &amp; Gibs—Dye in flowers (1901-02, No. 45). The enquiry has been completed and the results published in the Agri cultural Ledger No. 2 of 1908. Csesalpinia coriaria, Willd. —Divi-Divi, pods (1896-97, No. 72). The enquiry as to the possibility of making use of this plant in India will be prosecuted. Csesalpinia digyna, Rottl.—Pods (1895-96, No. 5). The enquiry is being continued. Agave heteracantha, Zucc .—Tampico fibre (1902, No. 19). Enquiry to be continued. Agave sisalana, Perirne, and other species—Sisal hemp (1895-96, No. 19). It is contemplated to publish an Agricultural Ledger as a sequel to No. 7 of 1906, which will contain more particularly economic infor mation. Facts for it are being collected. Bombyx spp.—Silk (1904, No. 141). Working up of the material collected is in hand. Corchorus spp.—Jute (1895-96, No. 38). The promised Agricultural Ledger on the races of jute has been published, and also a note on edible jutes. These edible jutes make quite a good ‘ spinach’ for the table. Selection work in co-operation with Mr. R. S. Finlow is being conducted. Furcraea spp.—Mauritius Hemp (1907, No. 187). The report on Agaves by Mr. Drummond and Colonel Prain (Agricultural Ledger No. 7 of 1906, page 94 ) contains references to these plants ; but unfortunately the two in India are not at present precisely determined. Flowers are wanted, and information regarding them is being collected. Marsdenia tenacissima, W. &lt;&amp; A .—Rajmehal Hemp (1908, No. 202).

An examination and valuations at the Im perial Institute of wool, yarn and patti spun in the Central Jail, Coim batore, were obtained for the Madras Government. The wool was from cross bred merino sheep, but of too mixed a type to be in great demand. Crossing and selection of the animals is required in order to get a more uniform wool.

Sir, /-v^ - /t v I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Dr. David D. Muir's letter dated the 5th August 1912, in which he makes a request to be furnished with the seed of Artenisia Maritima , (syn. A. pauciflc ra) the wormseed or Santonica from the Nor£h Western regions of India if possible, for cultivation in Mukden. He also asks if I can givehirr any information on the subject. At his request I send to you the following information about the plant as available in my Office. 2. The plant is known in the vernacular as Shih, Sarigun, Kirmala, Kirmani-owa, Trek, Zher, Tarkhasperah, etc. It is most abundant in the Western Himalayasfrom Kashmir to Kumaun, altitude 7,000 to 9,000 feet. It is abundant in Western Tibet on salt plains between 9,000 to 14,000 feet. Dr. (now Sir) George Watt noted that 'miles of country in Lahoul are covered with this plant with almost no other plant. I + is met with in Kashmir and is a characteristic plant of Baltistan, and of the valleys in Gilgit and Astor. Dr. Aitchison in his 'Botany of the Afgan Delimitation Commission save that this plant with A. campestria is a characteristic of the whole country round Hari-ud Valley. This Office Herbarium possesses specimen^ of the plant collected by Dr. Watt in Lahcul and those collected in Kirani near Quetta and Saniawi in 1903 by Mr Hughes-Buller, I.C.S., then Superintendent of the Imperial Gazetteer, Baluchistan. 3. The chief use to which the plant is put is for fodder and/M- and fuel but it is often used as a remedy for stomach-aohe in Baluchistan. For the medicinal purposes the drug is entirely imported from Persia and Afghanistan. 4. I have made arrangements to procure the seed from the localities mentioned above for your experimental cultivation which will be forwarded to you in due course. 1 have also to suggest that if you wish to have the Persian seed you should apply to the British Political Agent at Koweit, Persian Gulf.
