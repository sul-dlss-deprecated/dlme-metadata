The papers cover: proposals for funds to be forwarded to and distributed by the United States Consul at Baghdad; the advance of funds to Britain’s Vice-Consul at Kerbala [Karbala] (Mohamad Hassan Mohsin), now in Constantinople [Istanbul]; the payment of relief and pensions to British Indians and their dependents in Baghdad; payments for accommodation for British Indians in Baghdad, made by the United States Consul at Baghdad; expenditure incurred by the withdrawal of British consular staff from Baghdad and Kerbala. A large portion of the file concerns arrangements for the continuation of pension payments to the widow and heirs (now resident in Constantinople and Smyrna [İzmir]) of the late Said Yacoub Khan (various spellings throughout the file) who had been awarded a pension prior to his death for ‘high services’ rendered to Queen Victoria (f 80). The file’s principal correspondents are: the Foreign Office, including the Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Algernon Law; the British High Commissioner in Constantinople, Horace George Montagu Rumbold; the Political Department of the Government of Bombay.The volume includes a divider which gives the subject number, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Prisoners of War</topic></subject><subject><topic>Emigrant remittances</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Bombay, Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>United States Federal Government</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Baghdad</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Mesopotamia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Pensions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001ac#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001ac#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
