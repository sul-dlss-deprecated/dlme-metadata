By cancelling stamps, appears to unnecessarily cumbersonie and cases have occurred recently in which there was some delay in affixing scamps and the parties were able to compromise outside the Court before it was done, and objected to paying the amounts due. I propose in future to collect the fees in cash before posting a case for hearing or issuing any process and to remit half the amount so sollec^ed you monthly in cash.

The papers consist of receipts and covering letters relating to the payment by the Political Agency of the Government's share of net receipts of Joint Court fees. The fees were distributed on a monthly basis, the exception being in February 1939 when those of March-December 1938 were paid all at once. The correspondence includes a proposal in June 1929 by the Political Agent, later implemented, to make the collection of fees more efficient.Folios 234-41 are internal office notes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Courts</topic></subject><subject><topic>Fees</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000367#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
