To Kis His The The The Majesty’s Majesty’s Political Political Political Consul, Bandar Abbas, Vice-Consul, Lingeh, A gent, Bahrain, Agent, Muscat, Agent, Muwait. Monorandun . Owing to the shortage and exceeciin(rly high price of Kerosene in Gulf ports despite the proxinity of the -dan supply, representations have recently been nade by • this office. Deputy Civil Connissioner, Basra and General anager of the Anglo-Persian Oil Co. at Kohartmerah to the Inspector General of Oonnunications. As you will see from the enclosed nenor&amp;ndur. from the A.Q.M.G., Lines of Coianunication, tlio Iiilitary autrio- rities have now agreed to release a certain quantity of oil for the specific purposes of (a) providing for the wants of the ports and imediate surroundings; (b) cheapening the price to the consumer; (o) permitting import to the interior and thus removing any impression that the Anglo- 'ersian Oil Co.’fj supply has run short, or is not devoted to Persia’s own requirements. There always lias been plenty of oil; the difficul ty bo far lias been lack of tins, and wooden cases are apparently not available either. The A.P.O.C. agents in your port will no doubt receive instructions and a consignment before long. The intention of the Military authorities is that the supply in tins allotted to your port should be devoted to supplying thethe interior ae far ao possible * the actual consumption in your port and neighbouring ports provided by the oil in barrels. You will no doubt assist and. advise the agents as far as possible in the natter of using old tins for local consumption. The point is that they should try and utilize the dIj., in whatever receptacles sent; this is not the tine for insisting on forms of packing at present unavailable.

As suggested by Mr. Chick at Bushire, he and no doubt other British Officials at other Gulf Ports will assist by collecting tins into which these barrels can be emptied to ensure their quick return. reserved for transport into the interior, hrthen, t he presence of cheap oil at the Ports will induce the local Traders to utilize old tins, which they will solder themselves, as well as to provide the necessary meang of transport into the interior. Thus the imminence of the oil famine in this land of oil, feared by Mr. Walpole, will be averted until such time as he can arrange for bulk oil storage and transport in the Gulf Porta. P.T.

Before Proceeding on Xeare I venture to sutait for record the following Inforraation which apart from the ral ' ln “ an ’ 1 bl0&lt;,ka48 'iOesf.ons, shows how wntLfaetory and ansaltable Shaikh Salim i s a « a ruler.

I explained to him that the case of .Bahrain was •■If.ferent is there wwh»d an agreement with the Shaikh as re- gar-, foreigners and that 1 eoUC offer him no hope in that direction.. „ 0 persisted i, his requost,asking a. a concrete oase what action,if any,they could hope for from .» if one of their number was imprisoned unjustly or asrdared,to which I replied that,'while they were.of course,entirely subject to the Ruler of the country in which they saw fit to reside,the Political Agent wtwld no doubt be able to afford them his good office# in ease of any serious miscarriage of Justice or out- ■•oon My. Thera seems to be widespread dissatisfaction with Shaikh Salim's methods of Government. I attach a note by Lieu* MoCollura on' .he opinions advanced by a leading Arab merchant .,«• v cnnvers ytlori; /hlle these opinions are/ rather .randloce and partly the outsome of a personal grlsyanee,they appear to refleet In the aala .^at l a pa SS - lni ln th \S n * 8 ° f t: ' 0 'here are two ..rent . of/Tfesattofaetlon ln The ««,*«, **•“ * p ^ th i « 1 m «&gt;• utter of the issee of Jer . mU8 f ° r th0 eXport of India to towalttthe a.r- ohants,although thlnhin^ the conutlone .oaewhat hard.vrtsh to carry on with trade while Shaikh Salln represents thea to ato.tlns that they wont free trade or no trade, partly to make thing, difflealt for us and partly to get all the Prom Into hie own hands.

No further traee of him was diseoversd but later reaours were current in the bazaar that a 'Gem:mi'had been in Kuwait. One of the ’fission servants stated to Dr.Iiylrea that he had spoken to the aim whose Arabic was good.' I an somewhat sceptical regarding the report as ay informant,a European,saw the man on three occasions but did not re ort • the matter till sorae time after seeing him. (1). On the night of August/^Liout.McCollum, ms* 3/Lieut Collier end Messrs Gray (of Gray Mackenzie) and Bradshaw (of Sorlek Scott )who were all dining in the Rest House were apparently urugged,probably by opium administered in their dinner. There was nothing stolen and no ordinary explanation of the occurrence. Subsequently Lieut.McCollum suffered slightly from symptoms suggestive of copper poisonong though he has no copper cooking pots,Mr.Gray complained of similar ' symptoms. It should be added that at the time they were ex periencing difficulty in getting a ao:k and various temporary J»on wore bei ng trled/~'Abdul Latlf.Mudir of the Customs,who is regarded by the Shaikh with very considerable disfavour as bein_. t m anglophile,visited the Shaikh's mag.'. 1c and then Mulla Saleh (the Shaikh's Secretary)and shortly afterwards was extremely ill with symptoms whl ;h pointed strongly to poison,probably arson!s.

He aetually . had with him Hulla Saleh and a relation of Yusuf al Dawairl and they were no doubt dlsaus.ln* .the possibility of a final refusal,as even after receiving sir Persy Cox’ message the Shaikh was much against acceding to our request. I consider In not seeing Lieut.’,feCollum the Shaikh was guilty of grave discourtesy.but I decided to take no steps m the matter as the Shaikh was much upset at the time .and I think that any further unpalatable action on our part might very Possibly have driven him into open defiance. Zo Copy to Pol 1 11 A * Captciin* I * Ae J rolltltoa A^©nt # Kuwait Deputy Political Resident,BushireyConfidential. Demi-Official. Political Agency, Kuwait, Dated September Pth, 1918. Colonel Howell aalced me to send you a note to put you in touch with Kuwait affairs and with this are going three notes, which give you full information on our principal questions. The A,)man and BlocVade questions are the only real questions in Kuwait at the present time and owe their importance principally to their effect on Sin Ja'ud whom Philhy is trying to urge into active hostilities with Bin Rashid and whose subjects are not at all convinced that his policy of friendship with us is a good one. They point out our inability or unwillingness to beep Kuwait in order and to recent unfortunate friction between him and tne Hijaz as showing that we are not in truth loobing after his interests. However, it is to be hoped that our new arrangements will satisfy Hajd opinion and impose a good measure of restraint on raiding and illicit trade. As regards the Shaibh I do not think that the leopard will ever really change his spots but at any rate Yusuf Dawairi is out of the way and I have done my best to hand the post over without a ld £ a °y 0 -^ difficulties between you at the beginning. MoCollum can tell you all about details and show you the Office and accounts system; I took over absolute chaos owing to my predecessor having been away in Najd but have put in a card index eto and things are working pretty smoothly. I hope these notes will help you and wish you the best of lucH here - i should have liked to have shewn you everything personally, but 1 think you will find things all right.

I am not itjtaVour of the occupation of Jahara nor of any attempt to check raids by the use of troops. There are valid P r sct ical objections to stationing detachment at Jahara and all our experience up here s&gt;ows that troops cannot effectively deal with isolated Bedouin raiding parties w o e objectives are not the troops but unknown third parties. n my opinion Bin Baud's complaints about Ajman rails have been greatly magnified by him for hi. ove- purooses and now that F.M's Government have decided that -din Baud is not to attack Ihn Rashid there is no reason why we should actively intervene in the matter.
