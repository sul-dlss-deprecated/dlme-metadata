State Police, ^. T t ^ . r&gt; T ^^r-n Bahrain* BAHRAIN RECEIPT. Memorandum : - I have to report that on Tuesday, 16th September, 1947 at about 7-30 a.m., information was received from Mr. Bird, Security Officer. Awali, that 25 members of the crew of S.S. Alfred Clegg (Panamania) had gone on strike and come ashore at Sitra. I informed H.B.M's Political Agent, who instructed me to investigate and take what action was necessary. Accompanied by Sgt. J. Hyde, I went to Sitra and, on the Causeway there, near the pier, I saw the men concerned. They all had their luggage with them. They were of various nationalities I ascertained that the ship docked on Sahday, 14th September, 1947, at about 12 mid-day and, that after tying the ship up, the crew sat down on strike in support of a claim they had made to American scale of pay and to which they had had no satisfactory reply. The crew also complained that they had no written contract and that The Master had refused to complete the contract part of the pay book issued to them when signed on at Antwerp. I spoke to and advised the men. They subsequently agreed to return to their ship, which had however by this time been taken from the pier out to the anchorage by The Master and officers, provided I went with them. I obtained a B.A.P.Co. launch and, with ^ Sgt. Hyde, took then aboard their ship. ^ q They went to their quarters whilst I went to see The V' Master, Gunnar Ulven, a Norwegian. ^ # I told him that I believed the crew would go to work if asked. He consulted his officers as to whether or not they were willing to sail with this crew. I pointed out that they were not likely to get another crew in Bahrain. They agreed to the crew, I then went with The Captain to see the crew. The Captain had, on some previous occasion, offered a 100 florins a month rise to each man, but it had been refused, I persuaded him to again make this offer to assist in arbitration. He did so. The crew produced their pay books and showed me that the particulars of ^ contract had not been completed and complained that The Captain had refused to do this, I had seen the crew Articles in The Captain^ Office and assured the men that they were properly drawn up. They ^ obviously did not trust The Master of the ship, crew agreed to work If given the promosed rise in pay. until an answer was received from the Head Office concerning their full demand and that their pay books were properly completed, I persuaded The Master to start completing the pay books there and then, including a clause of the 100 florins rise. I showed the crew the first completed book. They were satisfied that it was correct. The Captain assued me that he would complete all the books. We left the ship at about 12 mid-day. The ship sailed from Bahrain for Suez at 14.00 hours, the same day. May a copy of this report please be forwarded to H,B.K , 8 Political Agent for his Information. ^ si, &lt; / /</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000277_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/456</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000277</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/456</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 10/32 Strike by crew of SS Alfred Clegg (Panamania)'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1947/1947</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2013-11-26T11:06:31</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (2 folios)</extent><extent>There is an index at the end of the file (folio 3).</extent><extent>The foliation is written in pencil, in the top right corner.
