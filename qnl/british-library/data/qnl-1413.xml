Political Department. From, The Commissioner in Sind. To, The Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind. Commissioners Office, Kurrachee, 20th August 1870. I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1120, of the SOth ultimo, with accompaniments, as also of previous correspondence on Khelat affairs, and have to express my extreme regret at tire tone you have lately adopted towards the Political Agent at Khelat, Captain Harrison, and my entire disapproval of the attitude you have assumed in regard to Khclat affairs generally. 2. When first you were appointed to the Frontier of Upper Sind in August 18G8, I told you that I would with much pleasure give you at all times any assistance you might re quire, which my long residence on the Frontier, and intimate knowledge of all that had passed would enable me to offer. I desired also that you would freely, and fully communicate with me demi-officiaTly, as well as officially, that I might accord you the best support in inv power. This all was said because I well knew the difficulties you would have to encounter, being necessarily almost totally unacquainted with the politics, past and present, of that port of the country, and the risk there was of your being led by misrepresentations of interested persons to adopt a line of policy contrary to that which has been steadily adhered to since the commencement of the late General Jacob's rule on the border, and which had proved so eminently successful. It is with the greatest concern, therefore, that 1 have now to record that those intentions have been followed by such unfavorable results. 3: From the time when Sirdar Moolla Mahomed visited you at Jacobabad, in March 1809, you have adopted the unfortunate and mistaken idea, that he, and certain other Sir dars of Beloochistan, not only were victims of great oppression, which they had done nothing to deserve, but that it was our duty to compel His Highness the Khan of Khelat, their Sovereign, to comply with their demands, most unreasonable though they were. And this idea, in spite of the clearest evidence to the contrary, you still maintain, as is evinced by the communications submitted by you in December last, and subsequent correspond- 4. When it was arranged in the month of March that, according to a promise made by Sir Henry Green, interposition should be used with His Highness the Khan in behalf of Sirdar Moolla Mahomed, it was my expressed desire, that the newly appointed Political Agent at Khelat should proceed first to Khelat to the Khan, the Sirdar following a few days afterwards. This arrangement however was unhappily nullified by your not appreciating the position affairs had reached, and the Sirdars being given permission to proc3ed to Bhagwana, where Captain Harrison was instructed by you to meet them, and others, reported to. have greivances, hear what they had to say, and then go onto Khelat- ence.The Sirdars instead of going to Bhagwana went straight to Beyla (contrary to your orders certainly), the very place I had particularly desired they should not go to, as the Jam ot Bevla, then in power, was the most inveterate intriguer, and determined rebel in the country, and was known to he plotting another rise against his Sovereign, the Khan. It was obvious that if Sirdar Moolla Mahomed wished to be restored to favor, it was a wrong beginning, and would be very distasteful to His Highness the Khan, that on his way he should visit the most disobedient noble in the country. 5, It does not appear from the records whether you gave any written instructions to (Captain Harrison on his leaving for Khelat. I had suggested to you that he should not he so trammelled, but allusion is made by him to some, that he should meet the Sirdars at Bhao-wana, to hear from them ' stated in a respectful and friendly way, in what manner ' he could forward their interests with the Khan.' It would have been better had this not been done, and my original intention carried out, that Captain Harrison on entering the country, in his capacity of Political Agent,should go first to the Khan. Be this as it may. Captain Harrison felt placed in a difficult position by the unreasonable demands of the Sirdars, but fortunately his course was rendered clear by the receipt of my letter No. 26( k dated lat May. 0. That letter was called forth by your report of the dastardly attempt on the lives of certain of the Sirdars at Beyla, and the remarks you made at the time, which showed that you had adopted a very wrong view of the relations between the British Government, and that of Khelat, and were unadvisedly taking up the cause of the Sirdars against the ruler of the country. 7. In that letter I distinctly laid down the line that was to be followed, and expected there could be no misunderstanding the directions given. The words used were— ' It will be manifest to you, from what is above written, that the policy I would wish ' you to follow is that of friendly counsel to His Highness the Khan, as the sole person in ' Beloochistan with whom we have any right, or reason, to communicate. That we are in ' no way entitled to interfere directly between him, and his nobles, or subjects, and to ' c carry out this policy fairly and justly, it is above all things most important, that it should ' in no way be shown that we are meddling in the affairs of his country by identifying '■ ourselves openly with the cause of those who are acting in opposition to him. ' I have in conclusion to request that you will strictly adhere to the principles herein ' set forth.' 8. In spite of such plain instructions I regret to have to observe that you have failed to follow them. From the time when their issue was made necessary, to the present, you have persistently adhered to the idea that the refractory Sirdars were being unjustly oppressed, and that we were bound to force the Khan to comply with their demands, whe ther he liked it or not. You not only entertained these ideas, but you persisted in bringing them forward, in spite of your knowing that I dissented from them in toto, and caused the very unnecessary lengthy correspondence printed in Januaiy last. 9. This, though showing a far from respectful regard for the instructions I had issued, I passed by, and patiently went through the whole business in the hope that, doing so, might help you to a clearer understanding of what had occurred, and what should be done. But without effect.10, Now, however, that in addition to enunciating wrong views, and principles of action, you have further ventured to act upon them, treating the Political Agent at Kkelat unjustly, and censuring him, when he was carefully, and studiously, carrying out the orders I had issued, I must interpose, and desire that you will abstain from acting on the opini ons you have chosen to form, and simply follow both in your own conduct, and in corres pondence with the Political Agent at Khelat the instructions quoted above. These you are well aware were approved of by the Government of India, in Mr. Seton Karr's letter No. 951, of the 13th July 1869, and should not have been deviated from in the slightest degree, either in thought, or deed. I refer you to that letter, as also showing that Cap tain Harrison is directed 'to mark carefully all he hears and sees, and he should regularly ' report noticeable events to Government.' 1 do this particularly here, because I notice in iccent correspondence, you take exception to Captain Harrison reporting matter that ho heard, and what I regret most to observe, you question the accuracy of that officer's state ments. I his is a course most unbecoming in official correspondence's most uncourteous to say the least of it, and merits most marked disapproval. 11. In the 3rd para, of your letter under reply, you complain of His Highness the Khan having passed on you 'a gratuitous slight, if not insult,' by ignoring you in having sent a letter direct to me. It is not unusual however that communications should be forwarded in the manner this one was despatched. The Khan gives it, or causes it to be delivered to the Political Agent, who forwards it to the Political Superintendent on the t rentier. I observe that Captain Harrison's forwarding letter is addressed to you, and the fact of its being inside the cover directed to me, may naturally be concluded to be accidental. The enclosures were open, and all, you say, were placed under a cover directed to you. I do not see therefore any necessity for considering any slight was intended, or that an ' unhealthy tone' at Khelat should be suspected to exist. Neither does there appear just reason for supposing Captain Harrison ever thought for a moment of placing you in an awkward dilemma with the Khan. Long acquaintance with that officer, and a high estimation of his upright, straight-forward character, leads me at once to acquit him of any such intention. 13. With regard to Captain Sandeman corresponding with the Sirdars at Seebec, I consider it not merely ' imprudent and quite unnecessary,' but most improper and highly disrespectful to myself. In January last, on hearing from him that the Murree Chiefs had offered to bring Sirdar Moolla Mahomed to him, I telegraphed to him that you had been directed not to receive that Sirdar, and therefore he. Captain Sandeman, must- hold no communication with him. At the same time I wrote demi-officially, more fullv explaming how badly, and ungratefully the Sirdar had behaved to the Khan at Khelat in May 18G9, and that until the Khan pardoned his faults, and restored him to favor, no further interposition in his behalf could be undertaken by any British authority, and no inteicourse could be allowed with him. Captain Sandeman therefore in sending messen gers to Seebee, was acting in direct opposition to my wishes and instructions. A separate representation is being made to Government on this subject, for such notice as his Excel- lency in Council may deem the matter to deserve. lo. I do not consider that the extract from His Highness letter, quoted in your 8th para :, should have the interpretation you give it, or that it is correct on your part to iniph that Captain Harrison was in any way concerned in inducing the Khan to write improperly of any British Official,—nothing of the sort having occurred. The u&gt;tJ plural of the word Officer' conveys nothing, while His Highness is &gt; uitainl} iully justified in complaining of correspondence being carried on with Chiefs, wLohad Vebellcd against him, and as such notice must give confidence to tliosfe rebels, there is maple cause for his anticipating further rebellion as the result. I would also point out to you that no authority has ever yet sanctioned the policy in question. 14. The remarks in your IHh para: show the very dangerous extent to which you carry your mistaken views, as to the conduct of our relations with Khelat, when you speak ' of a wholesome check on the growth of his (the Khan's) unbridled power has been ' interposed.' The Khan might well appeal, if he understood that contrary to the repeated instructions of Government, you interfered to coerce him in matters so nearly concerning himself, and the Government of his country, as the settlement of questions between himself, and his rebellious subjects. But as he adopts no such tone as you suppose, the remarks are not deserved bv him, or in reference to any of the circumstances that have taken place. His Highness the Khan is well aware from the delicacy and courteous treatment with which he has always hitherto been treated by all authorities on the Frontier, and Govern ment, that nothing derogatory to his position will ever be allowed, and that any remon strance he may find it necessary to make will receive suitable consideration. No change has taken place in the Khan's disposition or sentiments towards the British Government, but I regret to have to observe that a very serious, and most undesirable change has taken place in the action from, and mode of procedure at, Jacobabad, which the Khan has not merited, and which cannot be permitted to continue. 15. Of the three causes of complaint preferred by the Khan, the first has already been disposed of. 1 would only add in reference to your remarks thereon that, when you state that no move has been made during the present ruler's time to accept such of the demands of the refractory Sirdars as are reasonable, you have most strangely forgotten the circumstances which occurred at Khelat in May last, when the'most liberal terms were conceded by His Highnoss the Khan to Sirdar Moolla Mahomed, but re jected by him at the investigation of the Jam; and judging from what has since occur red, I fear, under the expectation that he would receive support from you in his con tinued opposition to the Khan. Your refusal to see him after he left Khelat was very proper, and prevented the mischief which otherwise would then have followed ; but your continued leaning in favor of the Sirdars, which induces you to style them unfortunate, notwithstanding their ill -behaviour, is a fact that will be well known throughout the country, and cannot but act most prejudicially in encouraging them in their disobedience,andprevent ing their return to proper allegiance. Khelat history properly read shows that for many vears past, even in the early part of the reign of Mehrab Khan, there has been an ever recurring struggle on the part of the Sirdars to get the supreme power into their own hands. From the very commencement ot the present Khan s reign, this course has been followed. Fortunately it has been unsuccessful. Had they gained their ends, the country would have been divided into a number of sections, torn, and devastated by incessant dissensions, and quarrelling, with no Government, in its true sense, whatever. It is amazing to me that an Officer of your general experience, and service in India should have failed to perceive this, and should continue to discard the clear, and irre fragable evidence, that appears on every side, to show that these Sirdars have quite for feited the title of unfortunate, unless wilful disobedience to their Sovereign, and selfish persistence in promoting disturbances in the country, to the great injury thereof, and of the people generally, can be classed under that head. This however is a question that I hold you have no longer any cause or right to discuss. You were distinctly desired to consider yourself as only authorised to communicate with, and look to the, Khan of Khelat as the sole person in Beloochistan, with whom we have anything to do. and I must again repeat that you must adhere strictly to this ruling, and follow no other./ Ifi, The second cause of complaint is quite misunderstood by you. The Khan simply and very reasonably I consider objects to Captain Sandeman holding friendly inter- course with Murree Chiefs, and receiving them in his camp at the very time a portion of the same clan were committing a raid on one of his viliageR in Cutchee. The Khan no where that I see points to Captain Sandeman as having canned the raid on Poolajee, and it was quite unnecessary to draw such an inference. Indeed, the words expressly convey the contrary ' whilst Captain Sandeman was in the Murree hills making arrangements with that tribe, they descended, (fee.' In one place the Murree Chiefs were treated by the British Officer as welcome guests, while at the same time on the other side of the hills, a portion of the tribe were plundering the Khan's sub jects. Such happening, can only lead the Murrees to entertain the idea that we are indifferent as to the state of the Khan's country, and as long as they abstain from plundering in the Punjaub, they are at liberty to do as they like in the territory of the Khan. 1 he only mistake the Khan makes, is in stating Captain Sandeman was in the Murree hills^ Ihis is a trivial one. Captain Sandeman had been there, and was at the time on the Maree mountain, the extreme western boundary of the Punjaub, and within the hills oi course. At the distance Khelat is from that neighbourhood, the Khan might easily be misinformed, and misled as to which hills Captain Sandeman was in. especially as it was quite true that the Murree Chiefs were with him. The circumstances of the Khan's complaint certainly do go mos^ strongly to prove the urgent necessity for the system pressed from the very first of our connection with Khelat, and so often reiterated, that all dealings and arrangements with the subjects of that country, should only be carried on by the one authority in whose hands the political relations with Khelat are placed, and I have to request that you will intimate to Captain Sandeman, that pending further instructions from Government, he will cease to communicate with the Murree and Boogtee Chiefs, excepting so far as is necessary for the payment, and maintenance of the quota of horsemen from those two tribes, who are in the Government service on the Punjaub Frontier; all other questions should be referred to you, and duly reported to me. 1/. I do not see what the fact of the Murrees having made a similar attack on the K\ herees at Poolajee last year, has to do with the present case, unless it is intended to show that the Khan's arrangements for the protection of Cutchee are not perfected. This no one questions, but the point is, how they may best be so arranged as to protect the defenceless- I his can only be done, to any good purpose, by assisting the Khan in the consolidation of his po\\er, and the formation of a strong Government in Khelat. Captain Sand'eman's recent unauthorized mteiterence with Khelat affairs, and his friendly recognition of the Murree ( hiefs while they are misbehaving towards the Khan, certainly wiff not help to realise the abovementioned object. 18, It l&gt;cing unnecessary to conceive that any such insinuation, as you suppose, was made by the Khan, it was equally unnecessary to conclude that Captain Harrison had acted wrongly. 1 consider that the matter should have been more carefully weighed by you before you brought so grave a charge against Captain Harrison as is contained in your 22nd para. 19. In the following para, you say, ' it only remains for Government to decide whe ther the Deyra Ghazee Khan and Sind border tribes shall henceforth be governed from Kholat as a centre, or as at present from British territory.' This shows a very strango and awkward misconception of the whole position. The Murrees and Boogtees never have been, and are not at present, governed from British territory, neither is it intended that they should be. The object of Government as laid down in the treaty with Khelat, andas shown by all that has been done ever since, is to provide against attacks being made on our border, either in the Punjaub or in Siuti by the hill tribes, .and to b?ing about tlie establishment of a strong and peaceful Government in the country immediately adjoining ours. The Skid Frontier, from the judicious application of the Military means of pro tection at disposal, is quite safe from attack, but not so the Punjaub, where the Military force is weaker. The Khan of Khelat, from continued disturbances in other parts of his dominions, and the dificult nature, and distance, of the country in which the Murrees and Boogtees reside, lias been unable to reduce those tribes to proper obedience. Arrangements have been made at different times by the Political Officers on the Frontier with the Chiefs of those tribes, with a view to checking predatory attacks by them, but I must state that the greatest care was always taken to acquaint His Highness with what was going on, and to avoid appearing to ignore his authority, and position as ruler of the country. Sir Henry Green permitted Captain Sandeman to deal directly with the Murrees and Boogtees, but I am well convinced the Khan was fully informed to what was being dona The course you appear desirous of seeing introduced is quite contrary to this, and cannot be sanctioned. We may he well assured that no arrangement which deals with merely a tribe here, and a tribe there, is dependent onlv on the caprice of that tribe, and not fixed on broad principles, can ever prove sound, or permanent. 20. The third cause of complaint by His Highness the Khan is in regard to Captain Sandemen's proceedings in reviving an old trade-route between Kandahar and L)eyra Ghazee Khan, and a most just one too, for such a measure cannot fail to most materially affect His Highness' interests, by drawing trade from his country which would otherwise pass through it. No steps should have been taken in this matter, until the subject had been fully discussed with His Highness, and his views about It learnt. No further steps should be adopted until Captain Sandeman submits his proposals formally, when they will be fully considered, and after communication with His Highness, submitted to Government. .21. It would have been more becoming and more suitable to the. occasion, had you abstained from such imputations against His Highness the Khan, as are contained in your 23rdand 24tli paras and for which, there appears no other foundation than mere assumption. \ou are well aware that His Highness is ever ready to comply with the express ed wishes of the British Government, and you are also aware that it is proposed, in case of an extra subsidy being granted, that it should be disbursed through the Khan's Officers at Jacobabad, in the manner for which it is intended. I am at a loss therefore to .understand how you could charge the Khan with the intentions you ascribe to him. 22. The Khan of Khelat would raise no difficulties whatever, as long as his position is duly recognised, and he is consulted about matters connected with the people of his country. But when lie perceives a different course followed, compared to what had previously been the custom, he finds it necessary to speak, and justly too. Captain Sandeman's arrangements on the Punjaub Frontier, which were made with the consent of Sir Henry Green, .who carefully watched the Khan's interests, were certainly approved by high authority in India and at Home, but those proceedings were very different from the ones now under discussion, and should not have been mixed up with them. Captain Harrison also was in no way called upon to support a policy, which was contrary to the principles I have so repeatedly set forth, and which were approved of by Government. I cannot agree therefore in the statement-that he failed in giving support to the policy he was told to carry out. There can be no element of s'reugth in the plan proposed by. you, for it strikes at the very essence of the scheme which was mapped out from the very first, and is of such vital importance to the permanentsecurity and welfare of our Frontier, viz; that there shall be a strong and well organised (government in the Khelat State. There is no analogy between the position of the Belooeh tii'oc.-.neai our border, and that of the Patan tribes near the Punjanb Frontier. With regard to the former, we have a distinct Treaty with the Khan of Khelat, as respects their be haviour towards British territory, and in all our dealings with the Murree and Bnogtee tribes we are bound, as long as that Treaty lasts, to deal only with them, through and in co operation with His Highness the Khan of Khelat. In conclusion, I have only to reiterate the instructions conveyed in the 9th and I'.rn paras : of this letter, viz : that in your conduct towards the State of Khelat, you will strictly adhere to the course laid down in my letter No. 266, dated 1st May 1869, and that you will permit Captain Sandeman to deal with the Murrees and Boogtees only through &gt;ou. except in tue minor point, of paying and working with those members of the tribe, who are in Goverment service under him. I have the honor to be, Sir, \ our mo^t obedient servant, W. L.

Also discussed is Phayre's decision to censure Captain Harrison, which Merewether wishes to be removed, and a reminder of the policy in regards to Khelat which was laid down by the Government of India in July 1869.The letter also responds to Colonel Phayre's comments in relation to Captain Sandeman's actions, stating that he views these actions has much serious than the Colonel has and also stating that he does not see the interpretation which the Colonel has attempted to apply to correspondence from the Khan, who was well within his rights to complain about British officers communicating with his Chiefs.The letter concludes by discussing complaints made by His Highness the Khan of Khelat and attempting to correct Colonel Phayre's 'misconceptions' of the situation before instructing the Colonel to strictly adhere to the orders laid down in Merewether's letters and to ensure that all Captain Sandeman's dealings with the Murree and Boogtee tribes go through himself (Phayre), excepting where they relate to those members of the tribes in Government employ.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x00000d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
