The letter goes on to propose that stopping cultivation below the 'ghats' would prevent it being smuggled and that these questions and proposals were now before the Government of India, and informing Pelly that he may be asked to advise on them. A postscript to the letter asks Pelly whether he thinks the export fee is sufficient or whether it should be raised (ff 14-17).Letter from Evelyn Baring, Private Secretary's Office, Government House, Calcutta to Sir Lewis Pelly, 4 November 1874, informing Pelly that Lord Northbrook hopes he will take up his quarters at Government House the following day (ff 18-19).Letter from Evelyn Baring, Private Secretary's Office, Government House, Calcutta to Sir Lewis Pelly, 16 December 1874, regarding the Dadabhoys position and advising Pelly that he should bear in mind Lord Northbrook's advice on appointing a successor (ff 20-21).Letter from Evelyn Baring, Private Secretary's Office, Government House, Calcutta to Sir Lewis Pelly, 16 December 1874, enclosing a key to open a leather pouch, which has been sent separately owing to suspicions that letters were being opened as they passed through ports, and advising Pelly not to let the key out of his sight (the key is no longer enclosed) (ff 22-23).Letter from Evelyn Baring, Private Secretary's Office, Government House, Calcutta to Sir Lewis Pelly, 23 December 1874, enclosing a copy of a publication that Lord Northbrook had printed through his private press (ff 24-25).Letter from Evelyn Baring, Private Secretary's Office, Government House, Barrackpore to Sir Lewis Pelly, 21 February 1875, informing Pelly that he was being sent copies of printed papers relating to Baroda either for his own use or for use by the Council (ff 26-27).Letter from Evelyn Baring, Private Secretary's Office, Government House, Calcutta to Sir Lewis Pelly, 5 February 1875, informing Pelly that he had written to Colonel Daniel George Robinson and enclosing his reply (ff 28-29).Letter from Daniel George Robinson to Captain Evelyn Baring regarding Telegrams for Pelly in Baroda having gone via Bombay instead of via Agra and requesting official instructions on which route they are to be sent by. A postscript to the letter notes that if Sir Lewis could communicate his wishes regarding the matter direct to himself it would save time. This letter is an enclosure to the one from Captain Baring to Pelly, dated 5 February 1875 (ff 30-31).Letter from Grech Chunder Doss, Calcutta to Lewis Pelly, 26 January 1875, with note from Pelly to Charles Umpherston Aitchison, 1 February 1875 and reply from Aitchison, undated. The letter itself discusses Grech Chunder Doss' desire for a career in revenue and fiscal administration and asks to be considered for any opportunities that may arise in Baroda. The letter goes on to give his employment history, and testimonials to his work. The note from Pelly to Aitchison is regarding the identity of the author, as Pelly cannot read the signature. Aitchison's response identifies the author for Pelly and states that although he cannot officially recommend anyone he can give a favourable report of Doss from what he knows of his work, but suggests that Pelly give him a polite refusal (ff 32-33).Letter from Evelyn Baring, Private Secretary's Office, Government House, Barrackpore to Sir Lewis Pelly, 21 February 1875, enclosing a copy of the thank you given to Maharaja of Scindia (Jayajirao Scindia) for his participation in the Baroda Commission (no longer enclosed) (ff 34-35).Letter from Evelyn Baring, Private Secretary's Office, Government House, Calcutta to Sir Lewis Pelly, 4 February 1875, regarding Colonel William Earle's letter to the Commander in Chief's Military Secretary requesting that Major Hudd be allowed to remain at Baroda.Note in blue crayon from Charles Umpherston Aitchison to Lewis Pelly, 25 November [1874?] informing Pelly that he had just escaped being under Bombay and that he was to dine at Government House that evening.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023694736.0x000002#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
