(i) Sheikh Mani bin Rashid Makturn, cousin of the Ruler of Dubai, recont- ly died of Pneumonia in Hire village after a short illness. Sheikh Mani was a prominent figure in local politics and set himself up as head of the 'Reform Party'. In 1938 he was expelled from Dubai with his relatives and followers. Pie made several abortive attempts to return to Dubai, but final ly settled at Hira. The Dubai bazaars were closed for throe days as a sign of respect. (ii) Reference para 11 (i) of 4SL0 * s report for January. The Sheikh of Dubai sent out a pursuit party which failed to catch the raiders, but met with an Rbu Dhabi caravan carrying dates from Buraimi to Abu Dhabi. They attacked it and it is reported that some men wore killed and a large quantity of dates and a number of camels stolen from the caravan. 10. Saudi Arabia . On the 5th King Abdul ±ziz bin Saud was formally informed that tho Trans-iirabian pipe-line would be constructed. (See para 13 (vii) below). K U \t A I T : 11. Anti Locust Operations . In the evening of the 18th January, Mr. Cholmondely of the Middle- East Anti-Locust Unit arrived in Kuwait with the news that a jeep had overturned 150 miles away on the Qariya road and that Mr. Lee Oldfield had sustained a compound fracture of the thigh. He returned the same night with the Kuwait Oil Company' s ambulance and doctor and Oldfield was in the Mission Hospital by noon next day. One of the jjnir Saud's oars was also sent to Qariya to assist and followed the ambulance into Kuwait. Oldfield* s leg was successfully set and he was flown to Basrah on the 31st en route to hospital in Cairo. Scattered yellow locusts began tD appear on the western borders at the end of the period and swarms must have appeared to the South as sacks of locusts were brought from there and offered for sale in the bazaar, 12. Presentations to H.H. the Sh eikh of Kuwait . In January His Highness was presented with a 1946 Buick by the Kuwait Sulphur Company, 3 Chevrolet pick-ups by the Kuwait Oil Company and a 7 sea ter Humber Pullman by the Imperial Bank of Iran. 13* Local News .

The gathering, which included the Political Agent, members of the .^s-oubah faiiiily, and notables of the town, was subjected to a speech, a poem, and a son 0 in Arabic, The Egyptian National .onthem vra.s played twice. The elaborate core with which this entertniivaent was staged* Advertised, and photographically recorded, would appear to lend colour to the report that one of the miss- deeds laid at the door .&gt;f the previous Director of Education was lack of enthusiasm in celebrating King Parouk* s birthday. (iv) One Monsieur Amouray de Eienrouft, a Prench national arrived here from Riyadh en route to Basrah n the 1.5th, He is s&amp;id to be roving correspondent of 'Review of i/orld .affairs 1 ' and was the guest of King Ibn Baud for a week* He did not call at the agency. (v) Kuwait has been enjoying an unprecedented shipping boom and on the 13 th there were actually 7 cargo vosaeli in the anchorage at the -same time with some 10,000 tons of cargo to discharge. Mr, Suntor of Gray, Maokan^i^, Basrah, had to visit Kuwait and send 3 vessels to Bandar Shapur to unload there and rerturrt to Kuwait later, as the local landing and transportation company could not have started to unload them for some weeks. He has it is understood, warned shipping companies to load n:&gt; more cargo for Kuwait until April. Most of this cargo is for the Kuwait Oil Company who are greafcty handicapped by lack of tugs. The Kuwait Landing Company are obtaining a barge from Iraq and are having 3 more large lighters built locally. Further expansion on their part would be of little benefit as the Customs facilities would be inade quate for dealing with the cargo at the shore end. The local authorities are fully alive to the position but there seems to be little more they can do. (vi) The Sheikh’s cousin Subah an Naair appears almost to have cons tituted the North-East part of Kuwait territory into a fief. He levies toll in kind on all bedouin camping there and occasionally sends Sheikh /Aimed a small proportion of the lo3t as a present. He seems to be making Jahra his quarters for the time being and to be amassing an ever-growing fleet of lorries, (vii) General L*J, Sverdrup, C.3,3. of the American fim of Sverdrup &amp; Jhircoll, consulting engineers, Mr, Don L, Sullivan, U,S, Oil attache in Cairo, and Mr, 7,E, Bailey arrived by air on the 5th and left next da/.

British India Steam Navi^ation Company Ltd. : On 10th March, M.S. Dumra, one of the two new * D' class vessels which the B. I.S.N.

Her first and second decks are air-conditioned. During her stay in port Messrs. Gray Mackenzies entertained the local merchants and members of the British community on board. The ship has been finished on a utility basis and in order to effect economy veneer plywood has been employed in the first class accommodation.

Lady Medical Officer ; Dr. I.M.A# Doeg, who had been Lady Medical Officer, Bahrain, for four years, recently returned to Bahrain from the United Kingdom and has been re-engaged for a further period of two years. % Dubai - Abu Dhabi dispute : Remonstrances from the Political Agent and the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, did not prevent the sheikh of abu Dhabi from preparing a raid on Dubai territory, and so supplies of tea and sugar to Abu Dhabi were stopped temporarily. This had the required effect and the Political Agent was requested to negotiate a peace between the two states. A settlement lias now been effected, with the help of the POTC., which, it is hoped, will make for peace between Dubai and Abu Dhabi. On the 6th March both Shaikhs signed an agreement to abstain in future from all hostile acts against each other and to make no claims in respect of those committed in the past. The cessation of hostilities was greeted with jubilation by the merc)£antile subjects of both shaikh dans. One person who received the news with dissa tisfaction was the Shaikh of Sharjah, who prefers to see his neighbours embarrassed by hostilities. He is under the apprehension that Dubai may now turn anu. rend him fer the clandestine aid and encouragement he gave to Abu Dhabi. He recently vis .ted Shaikh Said of Dubai ostensibly to enquire about his health, but, in fact, to profess his sincere friendship and to try to get a reciprocal declaration from Shaikh Rashid bin Said. 10. Dubai ; On the night of the 17th Shaikhah Hussah, the wife of shaikh Said bin Mbkturn, Ruler of Dubai, died of heart failure. She was a woman of considerable influence in Dubai affairs and her death came as a great shock to the Ruler and her sons. The Dubai bazaar was closed for three days and the Shaikhs of Sharjah, Ras al Khainah, Hira and Himriyah, and the Regent of Kalba visited Dubai to offer their condolences to the Shaikh. The deceased who owned much landed property both in Dubai and in other Trucial Shaikhdoms and who had successfully controlled a number of business enter prises loft a considerable estate. 11, Dubai Lighting Scheme : Mr, Sunter of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie recently visited Dubai. He has reported to the Bahrain office that in view of the impossibility of securing materials from the United Kingdom the Company would not be in a position to implement the scheme for another two years, when the supply position mbght be expected to allow of the export of the equipment req uired. This is most disappointing, and other avenues are being explored. 12.

Tae Sofar decisions - they were made in Septemoer oy delegates of the seven independent Arab states at Sofar, Lebanon ~ were for economic action to bolster the Arab case for an Arab Palestine* They were concerned principally with the oil in v/hich the Middle East is fabulously rich and in which American companies are inextricably entwined. _ . , _ , About 95 por ce t of the Middle East oil is controlled by American and British interests, and Arab League loaders believe that this, combined with the ijnerican domestic and world petroleum shortages, should make .urab oil a major factor in United gtates foreign policy. . However, one gyrian politician said the Tapline agreement involved more than a simple attempt to influence American decisions at the United Nations, He said it is also a matter of local polities* With the United States already having declared for partitition of Palestine and with .arab feelin^ at its present pitch, he asserted no dyrian in his ri^ht mind could afiora to press ror ratification now* JX t the time the agreement originally was approved by the byrian Cabinet last September - before the American position on Palestine had been announced - President Shukri Kawarly and Prime Minister Jomil Mardaid were reported to have told Tapline that parliament would ratify in the first two weeks of its session. And as far as coif \ be learned here, Tapline has received no word to the contrary. However, the agreement was discussed in detail last month oy the Arao League Council, which includes Syria, in its meeting at Aley, Lebanon, and more recently Syri an newspapers have boon full of appeals asking the 1-33 deputies not to vote for it.

The crude is that of Aramco (Arabian American Oil Company) controlled by the same four American companies, ujramco 1 s war-time prices arc presently under invosti r, ation by the Brewster Coiiimittce. Only some eighty-five miles of the 1,14.0-milo lino have been laid out to pass through Syria, but negotiations with the other countries have been cample tod and the Syrian agreement is the only one loft to bo finally ratiiied. approve oy u e Cabinet, this agreement gives Tapline Transit rights through the mountainous southern Druse country for seventy years in exch-nge for which Syria is to receive ,000 per year in fees plus the right to purchase 200,000 tons of crude at the l0W03 In addition, Syrian aimed forces are to protect the line with the company paying the cost at a minimum of ^fl60,000 a year. jjLlA 1 I T: VISITORS.

The “Popular Tr &gt;nt“ — vile para ra.ph 5 ao^vc — called for a boycott, and even spread the rum our th-t their proceeds wore to be devoted to the Zionist cause.

He has expressed himself as willing to subscribe to all previous agreement between His Majesty^ Govern ment and the Rulers of Ras al Khaimah. since the sons of Muhammad bin Salim, whom he displaced as Ruler 29 years a^o, reached maturity, and he appears to have .Ivcn up all hope of repainin- his former position. In anticipation of the coup d* etat he removed to Dubai ull^ his movable property except a few pieces of furniture. Locked boxes in his house were found to bo empty, and ho had in Ras al Khaimah no ama except one rifle, and no c^rjaunition. In addition, where he could collect taxes and cus toms duos in advance he had done so by issuin^ drafts on merchants who usually have to pay customs duties, and had allowed all allowances duo from him in recent months to fall into arrears* n e.i .* i On the 11th March Mr. Emile Bustani, Chairman of the Arab Contract- Iraqi Airways have recently inaugurated an air service between 4* Porsi (i) .-In unconfirmed re ^ort runs tlv.t ^ame of the local ohias have (ii) Durin c , the last month there has been a scarcity of meat in Bahrain The question of recopnisin^ Saqr bin Mohd bin Salim as the new Sultan bin Salim, the ex-Rulcr, lived in fear of a coup d* etat everAs previously reported, ohaikh Muliai^nd bin Heinad Aali-^hariq Fujairah left Abu Dhabi and Buraimi by car to redeem the wetoun kidnapped from Kalba by Awamer Raiders. On o.rrival at Buraimi the Shaildi of Fujairah learnea thit the abaucted woman was at Dhank \.ith her Baluchi purchaser and * that the original abductors were somewhere south of Binain.h, under the Al Bu- Shamis. Ke followed the abductors, captured them, and insisted on the uncondi tional surrender of the woman. After repaying the Baluchi byyer the sum ho had paid for the woman the abductor restored her to the Shaikh of Fujairah who brought her back with him to Sharjah and handed her over to her relatives. The Political Oificer, Trucial Coast, is arrr.npin^j to recover the out-of—pocket expenses incurred in this exploit by the Shaikh of Fujairah from the Re ent of Kalba. • ' ?• Abu Dhabi - Dubai Dispute ; iii ■ Manasir, ■who are Abu Dhabi's allies, have committed many overt hostile acts against Dubai as well as constituting a continuing throat to tho people of this Shaikh dam. Up to recently, it was considered that their hostile attitude had the tacit approval and help, if not open support, of the Shaikh oi ‘ bu Dhabi; and accordingly 'oconomic sanctions' in the fom of suspension of cereals, sugar and cloth quotas, wore imposed against him in order to persuade him t-' fulfil his treaty obligations by withdrawing his help from them. These seem to have had effect, because when tho Political Officer, Trucial Coast, visited the Sheikh recently, he argued that if once the Manasir wore put in the position of being able to commit depredations for which tho Shaikhs of Abu - Dhabi rather than themselves were held responsible, they would be in a position to elackmail the Shaikh and his brothers to an extent far beyond what they can affot*d to pay them. Nevortherlcss, since they brought the Manasir into the Duoai, they arc, especially since that tribe have recently recei ved a severe beating from tho Dubai forces, to try and make peace between them and the Shaikh of Dubai Shaikh Shakhbut is sending his brothers, Zayid and Hazaa to the tribe to this end. 8. KJxLba: The Political Agent visited Kalba and Ras al Khaii.iah on the 2nd and 3rd March and found there the condition of affairs as previously reported, this was confirmed when his first car was approachin^ Ivhor Fakknn in the evenin k by a fusillo.de of small stones fired from ancient rifles - no one was injured. Ahmed bin Hassar. , ' :r ho represents tho people of Kalba, Klior Falckan, and the 'revolted' villages, stated very definitely that they had had enough of IQialid and his nephews, but would obey any one whom His Majesty’s Covorment approved. When pressed, he said that they -would prefer a Jassimi as Chief and opted for } laid bin Mohcw.med and 3aqr bin Mohammed (nephews of the recently deposed Ruler of Ras al Khaiaah) -and Moha.jmed bin Saqr (brother of tho 3‘iaikli of bharjoh) in this order of preference. The first choice seems to be most suitable e.nd he is bein_ consulted unofficially as to whether he would be prepared to accept the regency. 9* Beni Qitab ; (i) Tho Shaikh of Dubai has imprisoned the brother of the culprit until tho stolon rifle and ammunition arc recovered. The incident t &gt;ok place in Sharjah territory and not in Dubai as mentioned. (ii) On the 31 at January a cc.r belonging to one Ahmad bin Abdur R-azzaq, a Bahrain subject, carrying passengers for Muscat had a breakdown in the vicinity of Al Murro water well in Sharjah territory.

So far tho Shaikh of Sharjah has taken no action .against the culprits.10. _MDLian: (i) Durin (J the period (16/2/4d to 15/3/43) four robbers mided Abu - 33n.qara on the Br.tinrdi Co .st r-ncl stole 40 cows which they took to Burnini* Aoout 20 men from xiou DQ.qo.rci went to Burr.b.ii and approached Shaikh Daqr bin Sultan of the Nai»m to assist then in recovering the stolen cows. He did nothing for them. They returned without achieving anythin^, although they saw with their own eyes their cows bcin^ sold in Duraimi. (ii) It is reported that the Imam of Oman has ordered that Falaj al - Ghubbi, which lies in the Al Driz country in the vicinity of Ibri, should be repaired and that he is trying to extend his authority to the Deni Gahir of Al Driz but that they refused to obey him and are willing to fight the Imam if necessary. They have appealed for support to the other Gafiri tribes. It is reported that Shaikh Sulainan bin Himyar of the Beni Riyam will visit Ibri shortly, and that he has written to Shaikh Zayid bin Sultan of Abu Dhabi asking him to act as a go-between him and the oil company. The Shaikh of Ajnan has sent his eldest son Ali to Bur. .ini to meet Shaikh Sulaiman bin Kimyar on behalf of his father. (iii) Hilal Harsusi, a notorious robber, attacked a caravan belonging to the Bidah tribe when it was leaving Dhank for ^uhi (in Muscat territory).' Tno - oocrs killed one of the Bidah and stole four cornels and some dates. It is reported that Saif bin »Anir, Chief of the Beni Ali tribe of Yan,.ul (Muscat), has pursued the robbers. 11.

Zubarah: His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain has recently written a letter to he Political Agent regarding his 'claims' and the 'claims' of his subjects to property in the Zubarah area of Oatar. The 'claims' arc neither precise nor complete and it is proposed to inform them that their submission in such form makes the prospect of a settlement more remote. 1 E conxic conditions on Trucial Coamt : Owing to the post-war slump and the virtual cessation of pearling activities there is a serious incrcise in unemployment on the Trucial Coast. The price of dates, which constitute the principal f ;)od of the major part of the population has also recently gone up from Rs.11 to Rs.15 a basket due to a rise in prices in Basra. As a consequence there is a great doa.1 of emigration from the Trucial Coast to the neighbouring Arab countries. Local Affairs ; (i) On the 25th February His Highness Shaikh Salman gave a dinner party to soma 7 or 3 prominent merchants of the local Sunni community. This is reported to be the first dinner party of its kind since His Highness’ a.cccssion in 1942. (ii) Three of the schoolmistresses from loor.l schools, all of them Bahrein subjects, have recently been dismissed from service because of alleged 'immora lity'.

It never arrived and no 'bra00 of the crew, t^e lorry, or the suyar has boon found* D’uaij has land the offence public: % at the door of Subah and has protaised to kill tile latter if theJr - 6 - ( if tho men -'.re- not returned. Meunv/hilc, ns buly^h' s corpse would be of 'little vr.lue, he has helped hinself to r.nd sold - n lorry-loud of Subah’ s eujnr. Both Shaikhs are festooned with weapons and followed by hrraed body guards. Subah has nev^.r been really popular since ho murdered his brother, and it is generally hoped that D*uaij sheets first and shoots straight. Subah is capable of anything, but it is not thought likely that he would have killed the Subairis in cold blood, n )r that he could have buried tho lorry. The lorry wad found empty having apparently been intercepted on the way to Jo.hra but the three Iraqis are still missin^ and not likely to be found. No body has been convicted of murder, but the Shaikh has been persuaded to confine Shaikh Subah an Nasir to Kuwait Town, tp confiscate all his lorries except one, and to close his estab lishment in Jahra. lo V 22. Local News: (i) The Kuwait Government hwe issued Gam-iemorative labels bearing the likeness of the Shaikh for the 27th anniversary of his accession as was done during last year. These labels have boon distributed free for the public to stick to their letters. (ii) The 27th anniversary of the accession of His Highness on the 23rd February, 1921 was observed as a public holiday. No receptions were held as His Highness was away from the town and had issued orders before his departure for the desert that the occasion should not be officially celebrated in view of the present conditions in Palestine. As a result the Kuwait Education Department had to canoellall the entertainments they had arranged for tho occasion. (iii) The British Broadoastin^ Corporation announced in their morning Arabic Programme the nows of tho 27th anniversary of His Hi Janos s occession. The announcer after havin^ offered the usual congratulations to His Highness and tho Kuwaitis summed up the period of His Highness* reign and praised His friendship math Great Britain. In the evening a special programme lasting for 20.minutes was broadcast from Cairo. The programme was prepared by the students of the Kuwait Hostel there and was introduced by one of tho Egyptian announcers, who after congratulating His Highness and the Kuwaitis on this happy occasion handed over the microphone to Hamad Rujeib, acting -warden of the Kuwait Hoatol in Cairo. Hum:ad Rujeib read out a summary of Kuwait history from 1d9S to 194&amp;* This was f ollowed by thr e songs by the Kuwaiti students in Cairo. (iv) Mr. L.T. Jordan, tho new General Manager of the Kuwait Oil Company arrived by air on the 21st February accampaniad by Mrs.Jordan and wall take over from Mr. D.A. Campbell who has been actin^ as General Manager for the last ■^rc-’e months. Mr. Jordan accempanied by Mr. Schofield called on the Political A^ent on the 22nd. (v) Three lorries and a station wa^on belon in^ to the Kuwait Oil Compt.ny have recently been stolen by Iraqi drivers and are believed to have been taken into Iraq to be sold. (vi) Mr. Emile Bonstani a well known Lebanese Merchant arrived in his private plane on the 26th and left for Dhohran on the 28th. I (vii) The Customs Department has issued a now order regarding demurrage chr.rgcs. Tho time allowed for goods to remain in the Customs wdthout charge is 14 d'ys, after which the customs will charge demurrage of four annas a day per packr. e whether large or small. This charge has been levied in order to compel the merchants to take delivery of their goods without delay as the existing godowns are not sufficient for storing the large quantities of goods now arriving. (viii) The new road under construction from tho sca-front to the town square has now progressed sufficiently for cars to pass through although it has not yet been expanded to full-wddth throughout its length. Para (lx)..,-....~ 7 - (ix) There ie &lt; r , per b. y± i- price... ■ jx c i-iSexi oi‘—1 ci. l . eujL cicu prr.vc elurti^o wheat and the price 1^0 Lbs* but subsequently dropped* have increased considerably, •went up at one tine to Hs* 80/~ (x) It is reliably reported that 'Upline' expect to have their 'Sky-hook' in operation in a fortnight. They have now 500 Anerico.ns at Ras - al Ilisha ‘ ab, and the area they occupy is surrounded by an unscaloable fence L niles lonp;* This, conoincd with occ.'.si onal mputations, secures conpamtivc freedom from pilferin, . . (xi) The clash betv/cen the iiutair (b.Arabia) and the Badur (Iraq) has- piven rise to more theivin, and general apprehension in the desert than is usual. A Harbi \vris recently ro bed of all his possessions by the Dhafir (Iraq) in Saudi Arabia near Riyai, and two Badris are reported to have been seized and imprisoned in Kuwait as a reprisal for a theft of camels and sheep from the . . Awazoin (Kuwait). The Mutrafiq generally have not dared to cone further South than the Latitude of Jahm although the best prazing is on and beyond the Southern borders of Kuwait. The Shaikh puts the pcncral lawlessness down to the inoompetenco t. the Government of Iraq in their dealings with the Tribes. Raids have continued and Shaikh Abdullah Mubarak has made frequent dashes into the desert to recover looted property. The Muntafiq tribesmen have now been t )ld to withdraw to the confines of Iraq and the Mutair to leave Kuwait for Saudi Ar bian territory, and this movement is now in propress. (xii) Mr. A Mrs. D.A. Campbell of the Kuwait Oil C xipany left for Cyprus by air -n the 1st March and returned by air on the 15th. Their object was to prospect for a summer ciiip for Kuwait Oil C xipany employees. (xiii) Sh-ikh Ali bin Abdulla al Khalifa of Bahrain arrived by M.V. 'Dwrirka' on the Gth March an’, left for Bahrain by the same sto.amer on the 15th* lie stayed with Shaikh Abdullah al Jabir* (xiv) The Kuwait Government Schools held their half yearly Lxeiimtions fr n the 6th March to the 11th after which the students st .pod a play at the Sharqia Sch ol -./hioh was largely attended by members of the Rulinp Pejaily and leading merchants. The Schools then closed for the Sprin. holidays. (xv) The Kuwait Oil C upany have drilled to 2,000 Ft. as the Shaikh requested, but the only water they found was so highly iriprequated with sulphur that it was unpleasant even to Approach it let alone drink it. The Shaikh has persuaded the Company to drill him 'just one more' water -well inspite of the fact that they oripincilly stipulated diefinitely that they waould drill one woll '' ad one only, in view of the fact that the chances of obtainin fresh water were nojlipiblo. (xvi) The Kuwait Govermaent have had to decrease the cereal ration by a third and it is now only 10 lbs per head per month. This is likely to cause hardship to such of the populati on, if any, as are unprovided with spare ration cards. The Vopetable 'phee' alotted to Kuwait by the Government of India is also beinp issued at the rate of 1 lb per head# This is very welcome to the poor as the price of cooking oil is prohibitively high, and it is a pity that our year's quota is so meagre as 'oily to suffice for one issue. 23* Exchang e; ^period - 1st t o 15th March) 1 Gold Goveroi^n. • .Rs. 66- A- 9 1 Iraqi Dinar R-;. 12-14- 6 100 Saudi Rials ..Rs.98- 0- 0 100 M.T.

The Zilcris (British subjects) intended sacrificing 2 goats on a nearby hill in token of offering to a 'Pir', but the Mussulmans who had shared in the feast in previous years, demanded that the gaits be slaughter ed by them. The Zikris having provided the goats refused to agree. This re fu se. 1 resulted in bad feeling on both sides, the Mussalnans claiming that the Zikris had insulted the Holy Prophet and should bo convicted in accordance with th laws of Shara. The British Agent and the Wall restored order by ordering that the Zikris be free to carry out their rites, but not distribute any meat to Mussulmans nor invite the latter to the ceremony.

T R I B A L A F F A I R ,S (i) RaS iiL iOfoUlAK Sultan/-,.I Sultan bin Salim, tho ex-rulor of Has al Khaimah has boon making frequent visits to Dhaid osten sibly to repair his house there and to attend to his gardens, ^There were, however, indications that he in tended to instal himself in Dhaid and to use it as a base from which to harass his brother and nephew in Ras al Khaimah, and to bring pressure to bear on the Khawatir, who are supporting them. He collected round him a number of the bedouin of the Awamir, Wuhibali Duru. Na*im and Manasir and sent to An bin Saif of the Khawatir to come to Dhaid to negotiate with him for the return of the camels rifles and household effects alle'ed to have been stolen from his son’s house at Ras al Khaimah at the time of the coup d’etat. The Political Officer, Trucial Coast, has accordingly warned him, that he should desist from intrigue that he should continue to live in Dubai as hitherto, and that he should only go to DHAXD for the bona fide purpose of attending to his gardens, Sultan bin Salim denied all intentions to create trouble for his nephew and undertook to inform the Political Officer, Trucial Coast tr the Resident Agent before he visited Dhaid again and to state the reasons for his bisits, (ii) .DUBAI/aBU DHABI DISPUTE 4 n Abu Dnabi delegation has recently visited Sharjah and the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, has had a series of meetings with Shaikh Hazza, brother to the ruler of Abu Dnaid and Shaikh Rashid, the eldest son of the ruler of Dubai^ The Manasir have moved their main on gamp merit to Hasa and continue to resist the efforts of tho Abu Dhabi Ruler to make peace between them and Dubai, Shaikh Hazza has, however, given the Political Officer the Trucial Coast a written undertaking that Abu Dhabi will prevent themuaiefig any part of Buraini under Abu Dhabi control, a s a base from which to attack Dubai, He has also promised not to supply them with guns or camels nor make increases in the amount of money, cloth, grain, fiiffee and other food-stuffs which Abu Dhabi have hitherto supplied to the Manasir, nor assist them in any way as long^as. they^continue to indulge in hostilities against Dubai, ^ Shaikh Rashid di a s accepted these assurances as sufficient and '•'» is confident he can deal with the Manasir if they attempt to remewm hostilities without Abu Dhabi support. ihe economic sanctions which had been imposed on Abu Dhabi have now been lifted# ** number of camels, belonging to Abu Dhabi and alleged^to have been on deposit with the Manasir were captured by Dubai in their last engagement with the Manasir, She Abu Dhabi have asked for their return and at tho instance of both^parties, the matter has been referred to the ruler of Un:AI al Quaiwain, who has placed on Dubai the burden of proving the camels were used for war as opposed to domestic •purposes» Shaikh Rashid has promised to produce evidence. Both Dubai and ^bu Dhabi, have agreed to apide by Uma, al Qaiwain’s bindings if accepted by the political Officer, Trucial Coast. (iii) SLAVERY Abduction of persons into slavery is taking place on/-*..,OK a small scalu in the 'Irucial Coast but o-n a much larger scale from Muscat/and tho Batinah coast. The ai bu Shamis and the Nai’s still turn a blind eye to slave dealing in their territories, and it is alleged that tho Abu Dhabi Shaikh in Buranimi afford assylum to Bedouin robbers and abductors. The incentive to this trade is the presence in Buraimi of Saudi and Qatari slave dealers who pay high prices for abducted persons for re sale in Saudi Arabia. Unless Saudi Arabia can be closed to this traffic there is little hope that H.M.G, will be able to stop it on the Trucial Coast especially in these times of economic depresssion. r On his recent visit to Qatar tho Political Agent Bahrein took the opportunity to speak to the Shaikh about slavery in which some of his subjects are involved* A particularly flagrant example has since come to light of a manumitted slave who had been seized by his old master and sold to one of tho Ai Than! family, -The Shaikh of Qatar has been asked to produce tho slave before tho political Agent, ^SHIPPING r i in ' ■ - Thirty-two ships (10 British, 7 Panama, 6 U«S # A,, 3 Norwegian, 2 Duthh, 1 Greek, 1 Portuguese, 1 Italian, and 1 Spanish) called at Bahrein during tho month , 1 Imports were 3,868 tons of general cargo for Bahrein and 864 tons’ for transhipment to the mainland* Exports were 3 tons of general car^o and 207,943 tons of petroleum products, 8* P RICES PRICES OF - ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES PER KILOGRAMME AS AT THE 1ST OF MAT Commodity Rice Wheat Bread (local) Veg# Ghee Sugar Tea Shall Potatoes onions Mutton Beef Milk Butter Fire Wood Fish Dates Charcoal Coffee Control Price #/ 7 /^ ,0/10/0. !\c 3/14/0 no stocks 2/3/0 ' 1/15/0 0/9/0 no stocks Bazaar Price from 1/13/0 to 2/l/f from from 6 / 10/0 to 8/13/0 0/14/0 5/8/0 to 8/15/0 l/2/O 1 / 0/0 0 / 2/0 from 8/13/0/ to 1/6/9/ 0/9/0 0 / 3/6 from 2/0/0 to 2/12/0 o. meteorological Maximum Temperaturo 89 F Minimum ' 70 , 3 F Maximum Humidity 95 % Minimum ' 5 Rainfall O^O' 1 ' on the 22nd ' ' 16th ' ' 18th ' ' 23rdSECRET i i^) SECRET MOVEMENTS QE QEEICI^LS &amp; VISITORS . i^ajor M # P # A f C Tandy, A,B # E, left for Basrah by oar on tho 15th and returned to Kuwait by air on tho 16th* K, McO, Andrew arrived from Bahrein by air on tho 16th and tooke over from Major Tandy as HxLliSjncrU.

(iv) Hadif bin Huraaid, son of the Shaikh of Hiiariyah, recently refused to allo\/ the Company cars to pass through his territory. The Shaikh don is a fief of Sharjah but a few years ago the Ruler wrote him a letter recognising the Shaikh of Himriyah'a “independence'. (v) The Bahrain Manager of the Company has inquired from the Political Agent YJhether in the event that Fujairah territory is considered to be of sufficient geological or other interest, it would be in order for his Company to enter into negotiations with a view to obtaining an oil conces sion freon the Shaikh of Fujairah. The enquiry arises from the fact that while the Sultan of Muscat considers the Shaikh of Fujairah to be his subject, the latter does not recognise his claim, pays no zakat to the Sultan or any Trucial Coast ruler, and is in effective control of Fujairah territory. ^ LOCaL AFFAIRS . (i) As a result of the stoppage of supplies from Iran, the price of rice has increased from Rs. 3/~ to Rs. 4/8 per Ruba. This increase is rblt severely by the local middle class.

This rocc:?~ has now unfortunately been broken by the appearance of 6 or 7 casor. j n Manana. (iii) A second case of a lunatic seaman being landed and stranded in Bahrain has occurred. The previous one, a Spaniard, caused the Shipuln^ Agents who wore unf ortunately enough to be saddled with responsibility for him a sum of Rs* s-nd he had to be sent back to Spain with an escort of two Policemen, one of them a European Sergeant. The second case is a coloured man. The tanker in which he arrived refused to take him away with a fulli cargo of oil, sane of which was inflammable; the Shipping Agents not unnaturally, deny any responsibility on the ownors , behalf; and the Bahrain Government, although now saddled with him, do not wish to have him for an indefinite period in the lunatic asylum. All the parties concerned (except the lunatic) complained to the Political Agent that it was unfair to saddle thorn with ary responsibility in the matter. (iv) Following the report that Ali Somali, a Bahrain Resident was tcouraging Sooali Naval Ratings to desert in Bahrain, a search was carrxed out of Ali Somali* s house by the police authorities with no conclusive results. It is understood that the suggestion that i Somali was recruiting labour for work in Bahrain originated with the Iraqi interpreter of H.M.S. “tfRErr*. (v) On the 14-th a football match Y*as played at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia between a Bahrain team and a team composed of Italian and Sudanese er^lo-eoa of ARAMCO.

The proceeds from the match were dor -* 1 „ (vi) The Government of India have now replied that licences fur m: , import of pearls from Bahrain are being issued freely and that no liccne' is required for the export of pearls. (vii) The pearling season is usually divided into two parts by the month of Ramadan for which the pearling fleet returns to Bahrain. This year, as there will bo four months between that date and the cold weather during which pearling operations can be undertaken no pearling is being carried out before Ramadan. A-w. 4. TRIiliL STAIRS, (i) Dubai/Abu Dh ab i Dispute* Shaikh Rashid of Dubai has now certain misgivings regarding the -3- ® u aasuro.nces given bin by Shaikh Hazza of Abu Dhabi and has asked f or further clarification of the Ruler of Jtfja Dhabi’s responsibility for those luanasir employed by him or living with his subjects and under his protection. After further negotiations at the Sharjah Agency, Shaikh Hazza gave Shaikh Rashid another written undertaking which stated that the Ruler of Abu Dhabi would supply the Ruler of Dubai on request with details of the Hanasir employed by ,jbu Dhabi and that he was responsible for their actions while so employe da The Ruler of Umm al Qaiwain has asked Shaikh Rashid to produce two independent witnesses to testify that the llanasir had used the Abu Dhabi camels in their raids on Dubai. Shaikh Rashid has been unable to produce these witnesses within the time limit of 10 days allotted by the Shaikhof Umn al Qaiwain and has been allowed another 30 days by the Political Officer, Trucial Coast* (ii) The Shaikh of Sharjah has recently paid Rs. 2,000/- to Shaikh Rahman bin Abdur Rahman of Hirah in return for the latter’s undertaking not to ham Sharjah's interests, or to ccmmit any hostile act, directly or indirectly, against Sharjah and not to obstruct the Oil Company’s activities* (iii) Majid, Rashid and Hunaid, step brothers of the Shaikh of Sharjah, have recently requested the Shaikh to increase their allowances as they cannot live on the amounts they at present receive. Their allowances, which range from Rs* 190/- to Rs. 300/- per mensem, are not, in fact, generous; but the Shaikh has net yet agreed to give them any more. (iv) The Shaikh of Sharjah has been informed by the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, that His Majesty’s Government intend to renew the Sharjah ..ir Agreement which expires in July of this year. (v) It is reported that Saiyid *ihmad bin Ibrahim, Minister for Internal Affairs, Muscat, has written to the Shaikh of ^jman asking him to withdraw from Masfut which belongs to Shaikh Saqr bin sultan of the Mai'm as he is a subject of the Sultan of Muscat!

PALESTINE, (i) As the date of the end of the Palestine Mandate approached, preparations were made locally to guard against the recurrence of the anti-Jowish rioting which occurred in Bahrain last December* Reinforce ments of Police wore concentrated in the Port and in the main City Police Station while plain clothes men were stationed near the school to prevent the demonstrations which usually are the origin of the rioting* H,M. S. 'WILD GOOSE' had shore landing parties in readiness in case assistance was needed by the civil p&gt;wer or British lives or property were threatened. Perhaps because of these precautions, up to the present nothing untoward has happened except that in the main Girl's School, the female teachers went on strike. They were informed that if they struck they would not be employed any further by the Bahrain Government# They fell into hysterics and were only brought around by the suggestion of the wife of the adviser that, instead of striking they should say prayers on behalf of the Palestine Arabs for a quarter of an hour every day* (ii) Even though there were no exciting incidents here, there were plenty of rumours: A B.O.A. C. flying boat ms carrying a cargo of boobs through Bahrain to Tiberias for the Jews but had to turn back and then try again* (The origin of this was that a flying boat was stationed here for a few days and made short flights testing new equipment)* Outside Manama town, the rumour went that 2000 British sailors had landed, cordoned the town, and were preventing all movement in and out* (iii) The news of the invasion of Palestine by the armies of the surrounding Arab States was received with jubilation by the local population. Relief is felt at the prompt action that has been taken by the Arab States. The course of events in Palestine are being followed vdth great interest by all classes and the coffee shops are crowded to a late hour every night by people listening to the radio news broadcasts*(iv) King Ibn Saudis stock is a-id to have ADPngst tho locaX ■ ^ Arabs who consider that he has -taken second place to that of KSjag A Mnnah. of Transjordan in helping the i'arabs of Palestine. 6. .jr cmimrccArioNs .

(ii) On the 2Ath, an Avro-Anson aircraft was flown, frcia Sharjah to Bahrain by Group Captain Fairfield with one navigator and 6 passengers# It developed engine trouble at about half the way and turned back* The pilot had to crash land it on a reef.

Very few Arabs attended, the larger number of those invited refusing the invitation on the ground that they could not accept hospitality from the country which had recognised Israel as a sovereign State. A number of Jews who had also received invitations deemed it politic to join the Arabs in signing the joint letter to the Commanding Officer of the 'RENDOVA'. In the evening His Highness gave an Arab dinner to the U.S. Naval Officers^ On the 21st the U.S. 'RENDOVA' and the U.S.S. 'C.H. ROAN' left Bahrain# (ii) H.M.S.

The Bahrain Goverrment is considering preventative measures, (iii) It is almost impossible at present to buy fish in the Bahrain banaar. The hazards of a fisherman's life and the employment offered by the Oil Gcopanies and commercial concerns in Bahrain, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, have led many fishermen to abandon their profession, and the Bahrain Goverment is offering further discouragement to those who remain by insisting that fish should be sold at the old rate of Rs. l/Q/~ per ruba for largo fish and Rs, 1/- £° r sniall fish, (iw) While the consoler is being protected against the fisherman to the ultimate disadvantage of both, the removal of controls from the prices of mar\y other cammodities now flooding the Bahrain market is resulting in large profits (often as much as 100 and 200 per cent) being made by local merchants, Indian, Arab and Persian, 9.

T. Eyers of the Iiaporial b^.ilc of Iran left Muscat for Bahrain on the 5 th by s.s. Khusustan after unconclusive talks v/ith His Hihimcss the dultan. It is believed that an agreement would have probably been signed \&gt;ith lir. Eyers, authorising the Imperial Bank of Iran to open a branch in Muscat, had His Highness not, at the last moment, decided to grant an interview to the representative of the Eastern Bank, Mr. S. Findlay, who had arrived in the meantime. At one stage of the discussions, His Highness promised to make a decision before Mr. Findlay’s departure, hut the Sultan is now finding it rather difficult to choso between two British banks both of good standing. However, Mr. Findlay also loft on the 28th, without obtaining a decision. Although the closing down on the 30th of iiarch of the Gov ernment of India Treasury Office has caused great difficulties to merchants and others in their external money transactions, the opening of a Bank would bo more than welcome; local merchants hope that, irrespective of which bank succeeds, they •’./ill be able 'ta carry on their money-lending business. (v) Muscat's reactions to the termination of the British Mandate in Palestine were extremely mild. There as no Jewish (gonmunity and no large hooligan element amongst the local population. Deprived ox these raw materials of a riot, Muscat remains calm. Even the Palestinian ..j.rabs in the population, seen to be able to discuss the Palestine question objectively. It is understood, however, that Rassassi, the Palestinian Pali of Matrah, suggested to the oultan that he should start a local collection on behalf of the Palestine Arabs. His Highness is believed to have withheld permission, no doubt through his desire not to incur His Majesty's Government's displeasure by oecoising officially involved in the Palestine issue, and partly we think, lest Rassassi should use his official position to press large contributions out of toe local merchants most of whom are quite content to leave the Palestine ^jraos to look after themselves. 21.

(ii) Major Bird returned to Sharjah from Muscat# The Sultan seemed extremely perturbed by the Company* s direct approach to the tribes in the Buraimi area and feared that the Al Bu Shamis negotiations would tend to encourage every tribe in the Dhahira to assert its independence by dealing direct with the Company. He eventually, however, agreed to recognise the results of those negotiations and premised the Company his help with the other Buraimi tribes.

Messrs* Gray Mackenzie sought to prove (both at the meeting and in subsequent correspondence with the Bahrain Government) that ttuch of the damaged cargo had been damaged before it arrived in Bahrain, that pilferage of cargo had decreased in recent months, and that delay in transporting cargo betv/een Sitra and Martfmah was in large part due to the fact that the Shaikh Hamad swing bridge in the causeway between the islands of Manamah and Muharraq was only opened for one hour during the daylight and for a few hours after 12 midnight* They suggested that the Bahrain Government should place police guards on board the barges and offered to dismiss any of their unloading cro^r who had a bad police record* It was agreed at the modting that landing charges should be increased by 15 per cent restoring them to what they were before the 15 per cent cut was made in June 1547* The Adviser to the Bahrain government promised to post police guards aboard barges but warned Gray, .,iackenzie that this would be for an experimental period at first and that the police were not up to full strength and could not allot sufficient men for this work* Regarding the closure of the swing bridge as the alleged cause of delays, he pointed out that the primary object of building the causeway was to facilitate road traffic between the two islands and that the frequent closure of the bridge to road traffic would greatly reduce its usefulness. He suggested that barges might travel around Muharraq, which is a small island, instead of passing between Manamah and Kuharraq* (v) This has made the third year in succession in which the 'breakdowns' and 'shortages' in the electricity supply and the fact that many house-owners are still unable to obtain electricity for their houses has focussed public discontent on the shortcomings of the Electric supply Department of the Bahrain Government* Consumers are increasingly impatient of a Government department which continues to muddle along from year to year without, it seems, either the willingness to order new generators and spare parts for a forsecable future or the ability properly to maintain existing machinery.

Ho was immediately removed to the Kuwait Oil Company where he died after a few hours. (iv) There was an acute shortage of drinking water in the town which lasted for about four days due to a very strong N.W, wind which compelled the Kuwait water dhows to remain in the harbour. The shortage also affected the Kuwait Oil Company who had to limit the distribution of sweet water to a minimum. As a result sane Junior staff employees of the K.O.C. went on a strike in protest for a day. The situation was eased somewhat after the weather improved and the water boats were able to bring in water from Shatt-al-Arab. K. 0*C. however complain that they find it impossible to build up any reserve of water, as demands always exceed supply. This is particularly the case at the moment as one of the water tankers is out of commission. It is understood that K. O.C. have located a water tanker for le in Singapore, which it is intended to offer to H.H. the Shaikh to ease the situation in the town supply; at the same time a further set of now proposals by the conpany interested in piping water down from Iraq have been received Ty the Shaikh. (v) On the 16th some local Iranian and Iraqi labourers of the K,0»C. want on strike. The cause of the trouble being that one of the Iranian labourers had occupied a hut without permission and when ordered to vacate the hut by the guards ho refused whereupon he was soundly thrashed by tK» guards. The injuries suffered by the beaten man were severe and he was admitted into the American Mission Hospital. The strikers not having returned to v/ork by the 21st the K. 0, C. ordered the contractors to compel the men to return to work forthwith. (vi) The British and American employees of the K.O.C. stationed at Wara transit camp went on strike on the 23rd as a protest against the management. A committee representing the disaffected men had a meeting with the General Mamger. Mr. L. T. Jordan on the 24-th and presented their grievances to him and it is believed that they have decided to return heme if their demands aro not meto (vii) The body of an unidentified man was washed ashore on the 25th near the American Mission Hospital. As no one claimed the dead body the corpse was buried the same evening by the Kuwait Government. Two father deaths occurred in the period* Mr. Patrick 0 , Donoghue* an employee oi Wimpey* s, dying of petrol bums,..and an employee of International Bachtel Inc. being killed in a motor accident. The Christian cemetry ia now becoming so full that it will probably be necessary to open, a now one in Ahnedi. (viii) On the night of the 26th-27th, a fire broke out in a ship building yard next to H.H. Town Palace. In spite of a number of local people who tried to fight the fire, it soon spread but was quickly brought under control on the arrival of the K.O. C. fire brigade but was only finally extinguished at S.a.m. the next morning. It is believed that the fire has cost one Moosa al Mazidi and Sons several thousands of rupees as the goods as usual were not insured. The episode throws into relief the tendency to rely on the K.O.C. for municipal services. (ix) A curious outbreak of land claiming by the Shaikhly family, reminiscent of gold staking in the past, is now taking place in Kuwait* Owing to the building now being outside the walls, parts of the desert have ceased to have a marginal value and began to appreciate in price. H.H. the Shaikh apparently mentioned that he would not mind some of the family taking up some land outside the walls if. they thought it worth while, and the result was a rush to put up boundary marks of land claims not only outside Kuwait and by the aerodrome, but also all the way down to Fahahil /and the*****and the Neutral Zone* One of the prine mover* is Subsh f 4 X staked out hu^e plots* including most of the Neutral Zone* and is •oujfttjjag. popularity by subdividing these plots among the Bedouin followers; should the Shaikh find it necessary to revoke these grants* the resultant unpopularity would fall upon him* It is understood that several of these plots have already been sold to merchants; but Abdulla bin Jabir has stated that he will not recognise the title to such land in his courts without written authority from the Shaikh which has not be eh provided, as yet* 13 . OIL. (i) The highest bid received by His Highness for the oil rights in the Neutral Zone came from the Philips Group (^jaorican Independent Oil Company) and the auction is now regarded as closed* Before signing the agreement* His Highness asked the approval of His Majesty 1 s Government, and as soon as this was received, he did so on behalf of the Kuwait Government and Mr* N.P* Isenberger for the .American Independent Oil Company in the presence of Mr* R. Mo* C. Andrew, the Political Agent at the Agency on the 28th, the Political Agreement having been signed in London on the 26th* The amount of film used by the AMINCO party for publicity purposes during the signing would have Justified a rather more formal eoremony than actually took place. H*H. the Shaikh then suggested that Mr* Isenberger should entertain himself, the Political Agent and Ur* Kcnp to a dinner to celebrate the occasion in Dasman Palace, as he had seen so little of them during their stay here* H.H. has subsequently made some sarcastic remarks about American living habits and his having the roams in which the party lived redecorated* Mr* Isohberger and the rest of the AMINCO party loft by air for the U.S*A* on the 1st July and Mr* Kemp loft for England on the same date* A request for a collective visa for 60 technicians to enter Kuwait has recently been received on behalf of AMINCO; this will presumably be a geological and geophysical survey party. 1A# CURRENCY EXCHANGE , 1 Gold Sovereign.

(i) There is no change from last month except for rice, which is Rs. 3/** per kilogramme in the bazaar* (ii) Pollovdng a similar movement of prices in Iraqi Markets, prices of foodstuffs have dropped considerably in Kuwait, in spite of the continued ban on export from Iraq and Iran. The recent high prices of rice have caused it to be brought from such countries as Egypt and Brasilf and supplies from the former in particular have forced the prices down. 16* SHIPPING.

(vii) On the 7th Muscat experienced a heavy gale, resulting in the loss of lives, sailing craft and cargo anounting to more than 4 lacs of rupees. Muscat proper aijpeared none the worse except for Moguhb where the cables to ^deb and Karachi appeared to have been severed by the seas resulting in cocplete breakdown of cable coonunication, the adjacent villages of SiSab and Matrah were badly affected. At Sidab all houses on the sea front were washed away. At Matrah nany houses were damaged and a large number of sailing vessels were wrecked or daniaged. Several seamen identifying theraselves as British subjects are now being repatriated as a result of the loss of their vessels. s, 3 . Barpeta due to arrive here on the 7th p.n. was caught in the gale and at one stage barely able to weather the stom, she hove to and ^nt out a signal asking for positions of other ships in those waters, in txise their assistance should prove necessary. Fortunately she was able to avoid calling for aid and arrived at Muscat some three days late, but undamaged. Officers of the vessel say it was the worst storm they had experienced in years. During the gale, a dhow belonging to an Arab of Mukallah caught on route to Matrah. The Ilakuda knowing that he could not possibly bring his craft safely to port, and realising that his chances of success were nil, decided to abandon tho craft which was unable to weather the storm# Before doing so, he placed his tv/o sons aged about 10 and 8 years respectively into a large v^itor tank, such as normally carried on boats making long voyages, together with two oats and a goat and closed the mouth of the tank with a stout wooden plank, hoping it would eventually wash ashore safely as the children were not able to swim, i/ith the waves lashing the dhow, the strong gale bloving, and the dhow breaking up rapidly, the tank was rolled into the sea, where it weathered the storra until vrashod ashore Just as the cover burst open. Sight of this attracted the attention of people aslcore who promptly came to the rescue of the boys when their cries were heard# But for the state of exhaustion the boys, tho cats aM the g6at, appeared to be none“the worse after this ordeal, which, according to reports, lasted sane hours# The Nakhuda, however, together with two others perished in the stom. together with his dhow. (viii) Shaikh Said bin Maktoon of Dubai arrived by launch in Muscat* ocompanied by his son Khalifah and his brother Juma. An official reception was held in their honour by His Highness at which other members of the Royal Family were not present..

He left Muscat on the 7th. Apparently His Highness made him the object of his larg|M|®e# (iv) Saiyid Ahmed bin Ibrahim has now reached Buraimi and it is ^ believed that he will soon begin opening the Wadi Jezzi to motor traffic* The Sultan is anxious that there should be a way to Buraimi area from hie territories rather than from the Trucial Coast. Mr. Bird of Petroleum^ Concessions Limited has already requested that the 7adi oe cleared. This would ensure that any future oil explorations could be conducted by parties starting from MUscat territories.

(vii) Say id Ahm&amp;u bin Ibrahim, Minister ol the Interoirras, for some time out of all coiiimunic-.tions with the Sultan, whilst in Bur-.imi. The Sultan became slightly anxious for his safety, but these fears have pro? groundless. Hs ana his party entered Buraimi in consider-ibl j r»tr-;nght, his escort, having been provided mainly by the comparatively po .c-ful tribes ofthe civilisec Batinah coast and returned to Unseat on the ^Ist.

Interminal, frothy «-nd fanatical speeches were the main item of entrotainment, but provoked little response. Fe :r local Arabs attended. (iv) Local feeling seems to have got lukewarm over the Palestine dispute Recognition of the poor showing of the Arab Armies, their disunity ana ; the early failure to reap the benefits of a compromise have contributed to this.The callous:jArab individualism iv s thus emerged undisguised m a attitude of indifference towards the fate of the refugees of their o n r,-:,.; (v) The Bahrain Government has an understanding with local meroh-.nte,that they must seilin Bahrain, half of -ary consignment of irereals, they import for retranshipment to another port. In order to avoid this levy Abdullah Barwish, a Qatar merchant, recently hac a shipment of 400 tons of rice consignee to Bubal, instead of Bahrain. The Shaikh of Dubai, however ado pted the Bahrain practice and compelled Abdullah Darwish to sell half his consignment^in Dubai.The remainder, further reduced by the theft of 400 bags at Bubal, was eventually sent to Qatar,its price having greatly increased. (vi) The new automatic telephone system is to come into operation about February 194b, over four years after Messrs Cable &amp; Tireless, first put forward proposals for its installation and three years after their terms had been accepted by the Bahrain Government. Local merchants are now com-- plaining that tho rentals and some of the regulations bear too harshly on the subscribers and there is talk of boycotting the new system. The aloe tricity Department of the Bahrain Government have promised Messrs Cable a wireless to supply sufficient electricity for the working of the auto- • matic exchange, when required.The supply of electricity 6or the telephone installation and indeed to the Public in general, is conditional,however upon the continuance in operation of the two and only generators in aerv viceand whose overhaul is long overdue.

Mr. Jamnadas of Xhimji Ramdas, 'was well attendee by the merchant community from Muscat and Mutrah, representing both Dominions. Mr, Lt^bart ana Mr, Ellison were present.

In the struggle th't ensuea two of the women made their get-a-way, the others being cameo oi#. on the camels to the Interior, where, it is?feared they will be sold as slaves. Reports made to the Mali of Sib were ox no avail as he has absolutly no means of either following the Becluins or^even preventing further cases of kidnapping 9. G.vADUR NBV/S . + (i) As a result of soilec and torn currency notes in Gwadur me the rel uctance shov/n by the Customs to accept them, merchants o.eai#mg in^Xi&amp;h ha* decidec to decrease their catch. Fish is drier, and exported as 11 fish mealX to Ceylon and Holland, wh^re it is usee as manure. ( pr ii) Since the circulation of two Annas coins of Indian currency has been rohibiteo. in Mekran, large quantities have been bought ty profit-makers for half the price ana circulated in Gwadur, wher- they v:ere being usea much to the discomfort of the merchant community, who are alarmed .vhat the two annas coins are no longer legal tender in Mekran. Merchants rather than accept these coins, have expressed their Desire to close down if the circulation is not stopped. An interim arrangement appears to have bem ^ reached between the Wall, the British Agent ana the local merchants* penc*^ ing action by higher authority. (iii) For quite some time, the cost of food in Muscat, has been rising steadily, much to the discomfort of all concerned# Y’ith tho advent of the monsoons, and the stricter vigilance exorcised by Karachi Custom^, the smuggling of rice into Gwadur, hitherto flourishing, is almost at a St~na-- still, with th-s result that the prices in Muscat ha.s risen by about &lt;eOCty&gt; A further rise is expected.1 0 ..

The construction of the Port Police Building is progressing steadily .-md it is hoped that the building will be ready by the middle of next month. Another new building, nearing completion is the Municipal Lunatic .‘Asylum next to the Christian eemetiy. This makes expansion of the burial ground now impossible. The Kuwait Public Works Department, is engaged in preparing the site for the new Customs House and the old Customs building is bain aemolished.

D li - l&gt; HP- Ur, Jinnah’s death came as a groat shock to local Pakistanis and to members of all cconunitics in Bahrain. The next day, the 12 th 3 opt ember, all shops and office*, including tho Agency, wore closed and flags were /flown...... »flown at half-mast onp.ublic buildi.n^a. In the evening a memorial service was held in the Juma* Hosquo in Hanaiviah where speeches wore made in praise on the dead man* Cinemas wore closed. (ii) Hr. Clear, the Cairo representative of British Oil Bn^inos (import) Limited, who are the ^iiddle East agents of Hossrs. iiirrloos, Biokorton and Day, visited Bahrain during the period under review and inspected the oloctricity system of lianamah and kuhnrraq. His visit v/--s at the invitation of the '.l.hrain Government. His report confima previous impressions that the supply of electricity has always lapsed behind demand and stresses the need to order new generators ruamediatoty in order to cope with the foroaeoablo damftnd next year and tho year after* ms it will bo some time before these L exioratora can arrive and do installed, 194S 1 will be another bad electricity year for Bahrain* (iii) Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &lt;?: Co., havo written to the Ba^irain Vermont complaining that tho many other points raised at tho meeting v*^ld in ...ugust had left no time for a proper discussion of the case for an increase in the landing charges# This is Justified, they argue, bo cause they aro increasing their barge fleet at considerable cost to themselves and have recently stepped up the wages of barge crows from Rs* 350/- to Rs, 530/- per mensem. Further, the Bahrain Government have recently decreed that Customs employees must bo pedd overtime by the landing company for any work done after 3*h0 p.m. This has meant that Gray, Mackenzie havo also had to pay their own employees overtime after 3.00 p.m. They arewilling, they say, to discuss those points with individual merchants or with a small committee appointed by tho Bahrain Government; and add that 'while they will continue to charge tho present rates until the end of 194b, they may consider it essential to increase tho landing charges in the new year. (iv) The higher wa M aa being paid on the mainland (and in Qatar) is attracting not only the Bahraini labourer but also the office worker# In Bahrain, where salaries are more or L.-sa pegged to tho Bahrain Govern ment scale, ho would bo paid a starting salary of Rs# 120/- per mensem; in Dhahran the Oil Company pay a Clerk as much as Rs. 300/- to Rs. 400/- per mensem. Ho may do oven bettor if he works for an Arab Contractor# Many of t. esc men, who are eamii\„ very large sums, aro illiterate and aro payii\, th .ir olorlco as muoh as Rs. SCO/- per mensem. Both clerks labourers are now paid in gold by .Hb'llCO and tho sale of this gold oosts salaries still higher. Thera is $0 shortage of clerks in Bahrain, however, as the Government Siohools aiw still turning out yearly a sufficient number of youn^ men with 'aa*ie pretensions to literacy to supply both the Bahrain Government and tho oil companies# (v) The K..i'achi newspaper ‘'BbTH' reported in its issue of September 4th that 'despite the overwhelming demand for Pakistan Currency' the Politiccd Agont had issued a notice that all the transactions should be in Indian Curremcy and not Pakistan Currency. Tho paper calls this 'one more proof of Britain’s anti-Pakistan policy'# The Political Agent has issued no orders regarding the currency to be used in Bahrain. ‘At tho request and on behalf of the Pakistan Goverment, however, he sent tho Bahrain Government and Bahrain banks a copy of a note prepared by the Pakistan Ministry of Finance in which it was alleged that malicious propaganda had been carried on in some countries in tho Middle past with a view to sabotaging and discrediting Pakistan Currency. Tho Bahrain Government replied that it did not consider that there had been any ^ropa^anda in Bahrain directed toirfords the discrediting of Pakistan Currency. This \/ua also the opinion of both the Bahrain banks# They added that Pakistan currency was beii\_. freely accepted by the banks, a char, a of one aiona for every ten rupees being made to cover tlio cost of its repatriation to Pakistan.# similar cliargo tlsoy sH.tcd, was being made in purchseos of aterlii\, Lotos, Iraq Dinar Kotos, and S^yptian Pound /Kotos## #-3- Notes to cover the cost of repatriation to their respective countries. In its editorial of the 17th September, 'D&amp;YN' a^ain, inter alia, charges the Political Agent with having issued a 'peremptory order on the banks and Government offices of the island not to accept Pakistan Currency on any account', 'it is quite obvious', says the newspaper, 'that the bias among the top administrative personnel there is definitely against Pakistani' ''O' (vi) The Persians, still seem to be carrying on particularly intensive propaganda re^ar&amp;Lng their claim to Bahrain. report was current recently in iianaiah that a Persian Deputy had offered a large reward and ^rants of land in Persia to anyone (including, of course, Persians in Bahrain) who could bring forward proofs of the validity of the Persian claim to Bahrain. The origin of this report was said to be &amp; Baghdad broadcast* A few days later an Arabic broadcast from Paris stated that the bhah had settled satisfactorily to Persia her claim to Bahrain with His Majesty’s Governicnt and that the islands were to be handed over to Persia. (vii) Ahmad Omran, Director of Education, Bahrain Govemnent, h...s retunied to B'hirain, ’naving been in E^ypt and the Lebanon. He has arranged for 22 Egypti.-n teachers to be seconded by the Egyptian Government to tlie to:'.chin,, staff in Bahr-m. Mo ems able to ;,ot Palestinians with bettor qualifications, but in view of the fact tlm.t they arc non-re turn-able to their country of origin, he wisely refrained from oi\.*gin 0 them. There is criticism cunongst certain circles in Bahrain rog^.rding the alleged frequent changes and quality of the teachers iiiported from outside Bahrain. (viii) The lunatic seaman who was landed in Bahrain off a tanker in May 1948 was thought to be an Adenose, and Gray Mackenzie managed to persuade the master of the tanker on her next visit to Bahrain to take the lunatic with him as his ship was calling at Aden. The authorities at Aden, however, wore not convinced that he was an Adenose and would not allow him to be landed. He was therefore brought back to Bahrain and is now wandering round the town. (ix) Ghulam Akhtarzadah who was once a servant of the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and is now the proprietor of a large new shop and restaurant called the Moon btores, recently imported a consignment of apple cider and established himself for a time as the most popular restaurateur in the island. Bahrainis, who partake impartially of scotch, local arak, and Eau dc Cologne in secret, flocked to drink cider in public. The alcoholic content of the cider was negligible, but such is the power of faith, that many who drank it displayed ...11 the symptoms of bcin w drunk. ..*s a result, on Friday when His Highness attended public prayer^ in the Juma’ Mosque, the Sunni Qadhi spoke so feelingly of the evils of drink and the reproach attached to the Government for allowing the sale of intoxi cants that the following d\y His Highness issued an 'ahlan' prohibit ing the sale of apple cider to the public. This was not the occasion, the Qadhi must have decided, to speak also of the evils of prostitution. He is a house owner and several of his houses are rented to prostitutes. (x) Durin^ the period under report, a member of the ^1 Khalifah family, Shaikh All bin Ahmed bin -*li, v \o was driving hi., own car, collided with the car of Muhammad Salih Sliahir, the Secretary of the lianamah Municipality. Shaikh ..li was considerably under the influence of liquor and had a prostitute in the back scat of his car. He was arrested by the traffic police and His Highness was asked what they should do wxth him. Mis Highness replied that Shaikh Ali should be detained in the police fort for the night. The next /momin^/(iv) -4- morning he was released and ordered to confine himself to his house for the next six months. No ^uards have been posted over the house and Shaikh .ill is only on parole. The difference in treatment meted out to one of the nl Khalifah and to the ordinary Bahraini, who would have received six months rigorous imprisonment for a like offence, has caused unfavourable ca.uaent. (xi) 7/hile he is in the United Kingdom, Colonel Moody, Chief Quarantine and nodical Officer, hopes to obtain sanction for the appointment of a European Quarantine Officer 'who would superintend quarantine arrangements at Sitra. The questioh, as to whether he will, as the previous Quarantine Medical Officer, medically attended the ships visiting Sitra, is under discussion betr/cen the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the Pilitioal Apent, the Company having given ■indications at various times that they would prefer to themselves provide medical attention for the crews, at any rate, of tankers belonging to companies affiliated to them. It 'would, however, be a . waste to have a doctor at bitra solely for quarantine work. The Oil Canpani'’ have built a disjjenS.ary there. 4* TRIxl'di ;^.IRS. (i) Dubai ~^bu JDhabi relatio ns. Throe Awamir and irwo Manauri robbers under La tar bin Salim al Azizi, the notorious robber of Dhank, recently stole same camels belonging to the Shaikh of Dubai. The shaikh of Dubai suspected that Shaikh Sayid bin Sultan of Adu Dhabi had encouraged thorn to do so, but the latter denied this accusation. The Shaikh of Dubai has sent a messenger to Ilatar bin Salim al Azizi of Dhank with an offer for peace and roconcilment. Many Manusir tribesmen and their chiefs visited the Shaikh of Dubai in order to profess friendship to him and offer their services. They obtained presents of cash, foodstuffs and clothes from him. (ii) Fujairah. i Referring to the attack, about a month ago, by robbers believed to be from Bani Qitab, the Shaikh of Fujairah sent one Ramadan ash-Shihi to the Shaikh of Dubai with an offer from him to make peace with the Beni Qitab. The shaikh of Dubai a^.-roachod Muhammad bin Ali bin Huwaidin, the Chief of Beni Qitab, on the subject and it was decided to write to the shaikh of Timm al Qaiwain and ask him. to mediate and brin- about a settlement. (iii) ^ waruir. The al Khamis, .*1 Kathir and *.1 Rashid subsections of the Mwmuir have recently declared hostility against the Beni Qitab. During the period under report they raided a Beni Qitab encampment in the vicinity of Jcbel Fay ah, killed one of thorn and took away a number of camels. „* Beni Qitab pursuit party consisting of 15 men overtook the Mwomir west of Buraimi and engaged them. One of the Beni Qitab was 'wounded and the .avemir escaped without any loss. Muhammod bin Ali bin Huwaidin, the ^arajuount chief of the Beni Qitab, lias now re turned from Buraimi and Ibri but ho has so far taken no steps to retaliate or protect his people from further depredations by the Awnmir#.iTadl al Jizjzi (iv) It is reported that Hilal bin h'aLiad, Yali of ohire.s, was j.n^ cruc ujd !jy tno Musceit ‘Povorment to erect a yato on the road recently completed in tno Jadi al Jizzi at the western entrance in order to control the &lt;7adi.

The Political Agent, has written both to His Excellency the Ruler of Qatar and to the Amir of Zakrit a slang then to take all measures necessary to release the man and send him to Bahrain. (vi) On the 12th, the bazaars of Dubai and Sharjah were closed as a sign of respect on the death of His Excellency Huhammed Ali Jinnah, GovornorMlcnor&amp;l of Pakistan. The Shaikh of Sharjah sent a telegram of condolence to Miss Fatimah Jinnah and received a reply from her thanking him for his sympathies. MPVEi.UN TS OP ROYA L NAVY SHIPS . On the 15th, H.M.

He was given a very w-m reception by the crowd on his arrival at the Town Square. The Political .agent called on him on the 14th.

LOq^ MS7S. (i) Three fires occurred during the period under review, Wo in the town and one in the Kuwait Oil Company Motor Transport stores at Magwa. The latter ms sufficiently serious to affect K.O.C development programme and aggravate still further their very uncertain transport situation. Of the two fires in the town, one was in a compound f.ull of stores, and the other occurred in two boons on the sea-front at low tide* In both cases the fire brigades wore helpless because of lack of water, and the fires were allowed to bum out. In any case, firefighting is not helped by the ▼nst concourse of passive spectators who seem to regard fire&amp; as one of the major amusements of Kuwait. The fires in the town were probably, due to carelessness and the high combustibility of materials after a dry summer, but a court enquiry found the KOC fire was due to arson, either wanton or to cover up thefts. (ii) On the occasion of the death of Mr. Jinnah, GrOVcrnoi&gt;G-oncral of Pakistan on the 12th joptombor, the Agency and Kuwait Government flags were flown at half mast, but owing to the amall number of Indians in the town, there was no general closing of the bazaar. KOC, a good deal /wiser.-7- wiser after tho recent strike of Indians over Independancc Day, immediately declared a holiday for all Indian employees, and a mass meeting held in the evening at ^hmadi was attended and addressed by Mr. Bourne, Superintendent Administration, KOC. No incidents were reported. (iii) During the early part of this month, larc© scale embez zlement from the Kuwait Pood Supply Department was suspected. Rumour put the figures as high as Rs. 1,800,000. This is by no means the first scandal in the Supply Department finances. As a result of tho investigation which was conducted, Nasir al Sssa, Director of Pood Supply Department, his assistant and Cashier of the Department were arrested by Shaikh ^bdullah as Salim on the 25th on a charge of embezzlement of 5 laks of rupees. They suffered a public boating and were made to walk barefooted in the streets and were ultimately put in jail. It is understood that the G-overnment is going to make good the loss of 5 laks by selling the property of Nasir al Essa, which has already been confiscated and which was largely acquired during the period he hold charge of the Department. (iv) The lon^ awaited new Engineer in charge of the Electrical Supply Company, has at last arrived from England and has managed to complete the switch boards and other work required in connection with the installation of the now A. C. plant. The wiring of the Eastern part of the town is expected to start during the next week and com pleted 'within from four to six weeks. (v) Two Egyptian and two Syri a n religious teachers of the Religious Institute Kuwait arrived here on the Ibth. Girls Schools in Kuwait reopened on tho loth. There was some delay concerning other schools owing to the late arrival of teachers from Egypt and Syria. However, Taha Sueifi, Director of Education Department, Kuwait, returned from Egypt on the 25th and brought with him some of the Palestinian and Egyptian teachers, (vi) Izat Jaffer, His Highness 1 private Secretary returned to Kuwait on the 29th after his journey to England and xjaerica. H He is at great pains to emphasise the unofficial and commercial nature of his visit, particularly as one Syrian newspaper stated he was conducting oil negotiations in London on the Shaikh's behalf. There was apparently considerable competition between Gulf and the Phillips,Group to entertain him in America, which he used to the full. Ke inspected His Highness' new yacht at San Francisco, a gdft from the Philips Group which he says as costing them over $ 2,000,000 and also purchased a new and very long Cadillac for the Shaikh. 7 as conversation turns largely on his oaourous experiences in America* (vii) An unusually large number of Iranian pilgrims arc passing through Kuwait this year, mostly in comparatively modem buses. They complain of the extortions they suffered in Basra in comparison to their treatment in Kuwait. There is also one plane operating between Kuwait and Mecca, and in view of the cheapness of this method of travel compared with road, this innovation will probably be extended next year. (viii) Tho Kuwait Public Works Department invited tenders for the construction of the remaining warehouses of Customs Department. Easa as Salih submitted tho lowest tender and was given the contract. The practice of putting out public work to -bender is long over-duo in Kuwait and lias at last boon forced upon the authorities by the excessive profits made by Government officials in work not contracted out* /(ix)- 8 - ( oOi.umccoc v, r i ch tiio oi'clc w P&lt;j.lc£»tino Refugees* Goninii ctoc ocon x jfuocI in Kuwait with the following jnembers: Ali Hamood Shayoo Yusuf A.

This is only one of the many accidents which have occurred during the past few weeks, and which emphasises the need for the reorganisation of the police force. ^A v j n» Leon noel .ikopiantz the nowiy appointed Surgeon and Medical ...dministrator for the Kuwait Government Hospital arrived from -mnerica on 30tn instant. .■ e is an Armenian, bom in Russia,, but who adopted^uaerican nationality at an early age.

The flag at the Consulate was flown at half-mast and the merchant communities (Hindu, Arab and Pakistani) observed hartal for the day. It was felt that the untimely death of His Excellency had robbed the Pakistan nation of its chief ’light and guide’ at a time when his services were most required. (iv) The assassination of Count Bernadette and his colleague by the Stem gand was received here with mixed feelings.

(viii) On the 22nd, Shaikh Said bin Kaktum, O.3.E., Ruler of Dubai, arrived in Bahrain by an R.A.P. ’Plane. He was suffering from eye trouble and had come to Bahrain for treatment. 2. OIL . Bahrain P etrol eum Company Li mite d. (i) The Bahrain Petroleum Company have recently informed His Highness that they arc resuming operations of the shoals and islands around Bahrain and that they hope to be able to report a fresh find of oil. (ii) On the morning of the 25th, the Company’s people were greatly disturbed by the manoeuvres of a low flying aircraft in their area. It first appeared over the Aw^li camp and circled industrial and housing sites at an estimated elevation of 5^0 feet. It later appeared over the Refinery at sitra whore, it was stated,, it came down so low as to be below the horizon of the top of the oil tanker-age. The plane is believed to be an R.A.F. one and the Company have sent a complaint to the Air staff Liaison Officer, Bahrain. At the request of ASLO, International ^eradio Limited, after consultation with the Political Resident, have now issued an International Notice to Airmen instructing pilots that the minimum permissable height at which they may fly over the -^ahraxn Islands is 1000 ft., except under special instructions from Approach Control./ (v)...»&lt;■ ■ 2 - Petrol eum Develq^nent ^(_Trucial _Coa3t)_Limited. (ill) kr. H.k. Jackson and l.ir. T. Altounyan, Deputy l.ana^er of Petroleum Comcessions Ltd., recently made a tour of the Jrucial Coast in tne course of which they visited the Rulers of Dubai, oharjah, Abu Dhabi, A Jinan, Has al Khaimah and Umm al Qaiwain and the Regent of Kalba. early part Oi Octooer, iJuhammed bin c&gt;uT/id, a chief of* the al Bu Rahmah section of the kanasir, who owe allegiance to 'the Ruler of Aou D^iabi, wrote to the Residency Agent and asked him to inform the Company that they should not enter his 'territory' unless they agreed to make him a payment. The Ruler of Abu Dhabi has informed the Residency Agent that no notice should be taken of the letter and that, God billing, he will have the writer punished. The Company are not greatly concerned as their immediate operations will not take them into Ranasir territory. ^ 3 • LOCAL AFFAIRS. (i) The Banrain Government is interested in developing some of the open land on inic isL-.nd for O-gricultur 1 ®*! purposes and recently asked the Bahrein Petroleum Company for an opinion on the possibility of supply- in^ enougn \v , ritor to irrigate an area of 100 acres. The company have sent^them a report on-the water resources of Bahrain and give it as their opinion^ that there are many areas where new cultivation could be under taken witnout overtaxing tne water supply provided it is done in accor dance with a scientific water conservation programme. They suggest as a first step t.....vb tno Bahrain Covcrnmunt should set up a department to ensure that there is proper conservation of the islands' water supply. It rome.ins to bo seen whether, and how energetically, the Bahrain Government -will act on this su 0 ^estion. (ii) At last the new automatic telephone system seems likely to oomo into operation - in January next. Not all the delay can bo attributed to a shortage of electricity as meears. Cable and bircless havo now enough oloctritity to operate the system. It appears that there is still a great deal of constructional work to be done and that they are unwilling to pay the high wages demanded by local labour. -vn unskilled labourer demands as much as Rs. 3/~ or As.4/- per day and a carpenter of mechanic Rs. t/- per day. ^ (iii) The Bahrain merchants have asked the Bahrain Government to retain the present telephone system until they and i-essrs. Cable and /’ireless can agree on the terms and conditions of the subscribers' agreement. They object to only 3 free cedis a day being allowed them, and say that they are willing to pay a higher subscription if the free calls could be increased to 10 a day. They also object, inter alia, to a clause in the agreement which states that the subscribers' telephone will bo disconnected if he does not pay his subscription or other fees on time. They ask that a month's grace should be allowed to subscribers in which to make payments. Some of their objections are reasonable, some childish and ignorant. The fact that Cable and Wireless Ltd., have a virtual monopoly in this matter precludes the working of the ordinary (or perhaps nowadays unusual) buyer-seller nexus. (iv) about a month ago when the 3a.train Police searched the house of a Persian resident of Aanamah, they found the apparatus of a still and over JO 0 alions of Arak. This find and the sentence imposed on the Persian by the Agency Courts has severely discouraged other*local distil lers and Arak is in very short supply, many drinkers have, however, already discovered a substitute for Arak in 'aqua velv*'. .ill stocks of this well-known after shave lotion have recently disappeared from J diQ Bazaar.— ... ..— I/(iii) -3- (v) Arak is only for the poor nan. The wealthy and influential who wants it* is still supplied v.'ith ocotch t/hisky. Sometines he has too much of it.. The son of a senior member of the A1 Khalifah recently asked Messrs. Gray iiackenzie &amp; Co., whether they wished to buy some 2? cases of whisky and .11 cases of gin. Gray, Mackenzie were in need of liquor but decided against buying it. They do not import the brand of whisky and gin offered them but it is known that these brands are imported by some of the American Oil Companies in the Gulf. (vi) Complaints are still beinjj received about the delay in trarw shipping car o 0 from ditra to K a namah. Local merchants state that this often takes as long as 20 days. To this Gray Mackenzie reply that the only crane at Manomah is an ancient hand crane and that they often ^ have to keep barges with heavy car -,0 waiting at Sitra until those already at Mannmah have been unloaded. The depth of water at the pier is often not deep enough for their power-driven barges and this cuts down the* time available for unloading them. (vii) „ A committee of local merchant- has been set up to collect clothes and blankets for the -uro.b refugees from Palestine who have been settled near TJasra, and have enlisted the services of Mr. James Belgrave son of the advisor to the Bahrain Government, as Secretary. Collections began on the 24th and enough wearing apparel to clothe a thousand refugees lias already been collected. Yousuf Kanoo, local agent of the ‘•Holland and Persian Gulf Line* 1 and a member of the committee, has arranged for it to be shipped to Basra by one of their steamers. Ho T/as also responsible for threatening a Jewish merchant who contributed a somewhat moth-eaten roll 'of cloth that he -would chalk up the word “Zionist' on the latter’s door. (viii) On the 22nd, the fortieth day after the death of hr. Jinnah, a commomoration mooting was hold in the ‘Pearl Cinema• and attended by members of the local Pakistan community and other Kusliins. His Kighnoss the Hulor of Bahrctin and his two uncles, ohailths Hohammed and Abdullah bin Isa, were also present by invitation. 4. TRIBAL AFFAIPS. (i) Qatar. His Excellency the Ruler of Qatar states that ho has not been able to discover the whereabouts of Naim bin Y/adiya who is reported as being hold in captivity near Zakrit, and the bearer of the Political Agent’s letter to the ruler of Qatar asking for the release of Naim bin .7adiya,who originally brought the infomation that he was held captive in Zakrit, denied under questioning that he had seen Naim bin 7adiya at Zakrit. ( Fujaira h. The dhaikh of Umm al Qaiwain has declined to act as mediator in the dispute between the Bhaildi of Fujairah and the Beni Qitab, as the Shaikh of Fujairah had demanded that the mediator should stand as guC'.rcintoo for the Boni Qitab. The Beni Qitab recently killed one of the bharqiycon at the foot of the hills.-4- (iii) Awamir» The total number of camel* which the Awamir looted frou the Beni Qitab when they raided their camy recently is stated to be between 80 and 90. The Awamir have requested t'nat the Shaikh of Dubai intervene and effect a settlement between them and the Beni Qitab. (iv) Duba i. Obaid bin Saqr, Director of Dairah Customs, Diibai, and Muhammad Hafidh, a Customs Clerk, were charged with the embezzlement of Rs. 48,000/-. They v/ere imprisoned for a week and then released. The movable and immovable property of the former, up to Rs. 24,000/- i.e. half of the amount embezzled, has been confiscated by the Shaikh of Dubai. '(v) Khawatir. On the 10th Shaikh Ahmad as-salf.

(v) Ismail ar Rassassi, Wali of Matzah, returned from Gwadur after his mission on behalf of His Highness, for the purpose of meeting local headmen#-9- 15&lt; LOCAL AFFAIRS. n3 (i) Two young boys, Abdul Jalil, son of oaiyd Abdul Bari al / Zav/awi and Abdul Kerim, nephew of Iiamdbon Mohammed, the late Post Master, left for Karachi for advance training at the head office of Cable &amp; wireless (ii) Bhaikh Amroun bin Ali Ja'dhi of Mukulla, en route to Muscat by dhow, encountered bad weather and is reported to have lost all his belongings including his dhow. He has spent considerable time attempting to raise a loan at the Consulate on the grounds that he had rendered groat aid to His Majesty’s Government at the outbreak of the war. Kis frequent references to this and his connection with various representatives of Kis Majesty's Government give one the impression that he is tryirgg to trade on them. The Shaikh is being repatriated. (iii) Arab, Indian and Pakistan nationals have registered general approval of Mr. Chm?chill' s recent pro^uncement on Russia and the Berlin Issue. . One prominent Indian was heard to rentirk 'i/hen Mr. Churchill takes the stage to make such an important pro nouncement then we can safely bet that we are heading for another 'JUNG' (war) 1 ’. (iv) A casual comment made by the B.B. C. on the conference in London regarding any one Dominion that wishes to be independent of the Commonwealth yet enjoy all the privileges extended to a Dominion, has created the impression that the reference was a pointer to India and its possibility of leaving the Commonwealth. Local Indian opinion favours the idea of India remaining within the Commonwealth for some time more until India can build up her resources, especially her armed forces. (v) Mews that the new Baisas of various denominations were to be introduced very shortly appeared to cause some panic amongst the local shopkeepers. The Baiza rate which had fallen to 50 per rupee steadly increased to about ~J0 when most of the baazas disappeared including those brought in from the interior by the donkey load. It is stated that whilst some got rid of as many baizas as possible havin^ heard the Government rate would bo in the vicinity of 100 per rupee, others again are said to have hoarded then hoping to obtain at least their metallic value. Owing to this increase, prices in food stuff wbnt up considerably. (vi) The news of the establishment of an Arab Government at Gaza that has so far not been recognised by any of the leading Pow r ers has been received with marked indifference. Local Jews cannot concieve the idea of an Arab Government without Jerusalem. The recognition of the Arab Government by Saudi Arabia, Syria and other J.* rab States has made no impression on them. (vii) The utmost satisfaction was expressed by the local Hindu community on the quick settlement of the Hyderabad question, and the announcement of Shaikh Abdullah, the Jammu and Kashmir Prime ilinister on the determination of the people to cede to the Indian Union. Recent broadcasts by Sardar Vallabhai Patel and others on Kashmir and Pakistan relationship have left a bad taste in the mouths of the Muslims in general. AO- 10 - (viii) Id ul Kajj wr^s celebrated as custouary. II.J* s Consul called on the leading Muslim merchants in Muscat and Mutrah, and on the following day on His Highness. His call was official. The Hindu festival of Dusserah was celebrated on the 13th. H.il’s Consul and the leading merchants of the Muslim community were entertained by Khimji Ham das on behalf of the Hindu community o 16^ TRIB.-iL APP/URS. (i) bhaikh Salih bin Isa al Ilarthi, accompanied by shaikh Hamid bin Suleiman arrived in Lius sat on a visit to the sultan presumably to talk 'oil'* accompanied by a retinue of some thirty be duo. n armed to the teeth, shaikh Salih called on H.Li’ s Consul to pay his respects. Escorted by the Drogoman Shaikh Salih was followed by his retinue who soon invaded the drawing room. They too felt they had to pay their respects to the new Consul, and making short shif.t of the refreshments that they were served they were ’ smoked out* of the drawing room. (ii) It is rumoured that the tribes of Baraimi have declared that they would not pay allegiance to the Sultan. This is because they feel that any agreement signed by the oil company should be signed with them and not the sultan. This appears to have followed in the wake of the nev/s that Major Bird of Petroleum Concessions Limited was on his way to Muscat to sec the sultan. 'Oil' is now the talk of the town including the leading merchants who are hoping for possible contracts with the .company the moment anything is found. 17 .

(i) For the first time in many years Muscat harbour presented a picture of a busy commercial port with five cargo and passenger ships loading and unloading. The harbour was a mass of little boats plying between shore and the ships with cargo and passengers. o.S. Qmeria en route to India was loading dates and fish, o. S. Lessekerk from Europe, whilst the Barjora and Bam ora added further colour by concen trating on passengers. All this with the cable ship Retrieve!* couple *cd the picture and must have afforded His iii^hnes^ 1 great pleasure. It was indeed a prosperous week for dock labourers, boatmen and lishenaen* (ii) s.s. Bamora arrived from-India on the 23th and sailed for the Gulf the same day. s.s.

The flagstaffs of the agency, Residency, station, nuharraq, and many coi-imercial firms were gay with bunting and the residency and Agency observed the day as a holiday. His Highness ohaikh oir oalman K.C.l.E. , sent telcgraLis of congratulations to His Aajesty the King and to Her Royal Highness. (ii) On the 1st the ohaikha Latifa bint Ibrahim, wife of His Highness, returned by air from the Hijaz. During the pilgrimage she ms presented with 2 Ford Mercury cars by King Ion baud, and these have recently arrived in Bahrain by launch from ..1 Khobar. (iii) Pith effect from the 1st Hijiri, 1368, the Bahrain Government has leased the collection of tolls on the Muharraq- lianamah Causway to one famed az Zayani at an annual rental of Rs« 6C,000/~. (iv) The 10th day of kuharram, v/hich fell on the 13th, passed off without incident. The usual processions were taken out by Persians and local bhiahs, but dispersed peacefully before the time of the mid day prayers. It appeared to bo a matter of koen regret that this year there were no camels in the processions® (v) The scheme is now nearing completion and this month, Messrs. Holloway Brothers have been able to supply water to a few consumers. They are being charged at the rate of Rs. l/U+/~ for every thousand gallons of water consumed. (vi) now generator has recently arrived from the United Kingdom. It will bo some time however, before it can bo installed* (vii) The Bahrain Government have been making an attempt to police the unloading of cargo and have already caught several pilferers. This was the result of a promise made by the government in Juno to try and post police to stop the excessive thefts which were occuring while cargo was being unloaded at bitrah for kanama. The pilferers received heavy sentences from the Bahrain Courts. (viii) Abdullah az Zairah appears to have been dropped by Abbas lakandari and other Persian Deputies concerned with \ pressing the claim of Persia to Bahrain and is living in Teheran in indigent circumstances. He is reported to have obtained a post as translator in the oaudi Embassy at Teheran. Just over a year a_o, he went to Teheran from Bahrain alleging to be a chosen representative of the “Bahrain National Party went to express the wish of the People of Bahrain that they desired to be ro-mnitod to Persia. (ix) On the 17th shaikh ...bdullah bin Isa, uncle of His Highness, left for Kuwait on a hawking trip into the hinterland. He was accompanied by his nephews, Shaikh Khalifah bin kuhammed, ouperintendent of Police, Bahrain, and Shaikh Salman bin Muhammad, one of the judges of the Bahrain lower court. „ The latter returned to Bahrain on the 23rd. /(*)/0...9......O -&gt; All local pearling boats had returned to Bahrain by One of the oi^er boats made a ^ross profit of 69 boats wi, h a total complenent of 25^0 persons engaged in pearling operations this year. The total catch is estimated to be worth about Rupees four laks. This has disappointed those, like His Highness, who hoped for a revival of the Bahrain Pearling Industry. They nay, however, find some consolation in the reflection that the pearling fleet only went out after Ramadan and that it suffered bad weather towards the end of the season. (^■) Rents . His Highness, who is himself a large owTior of house property, has long wanted to amend the existing rent law and allow an increase in rents. On the 2Vth, a meeting of the Rent Ccumittee, appointed by the Political Agent and consisting of representatives of the European films, local merchants, landlords and tenants, was hold at the agency in order to consider a suggestion that the percentag*e to be charged as rent should be raised from the existing rate of 2^6 to fa on the value of the property. Major J.S.H. Hudson, the Assistant Political Agent, presided. In the course of discussion it was pointed out hy the representative of the local merchants that the assessed value of houses under the present rent law was far higher than their actual value as rents had risen progressively without check for seme ten years before the law was passed. The Committee considered this point and found that the suggested rise would, in effect, be an increase of 50,o in house rent, which, because of the high cost of living today, would make for increased inflation and a resultant demand for an increase in wages. They recommended therefore that there should be no increase in the percentage of rent chargeable and expressed themselves as only willing to consider a rise if properties were reassessed excluding the value of the site. (xii) V enereal Disease . At the representation of the Chief Quaran tine Medical Officer, the otate Medical Officer, and other doctors, the Bahrain Government are taking stops to combat the incidence of venereal disease in Bahrain which, it has been stated, is amongst the highest in the world though no accurate figures arc available. The Police have rounded up all prostitutes for medical examination, and free treatment is being offered to those suffering from venereal disease. The Bahrain Government have asked that every person with venereal disease should undergo treatment at the hands of a doctor and have ordered compulsory examination and treatment of any person who wall not voluntarily undergo it. (xiii) Church Foto . On the 15th, Lady Hay opened a fete organised by the Roman Catholic Chaplain in Manama to raise money for the building of a school. His ISxoellency the political Resident and Mrs. C.D. Bolgrave, wife of the Adviser to the Bahrain government were also present. The Pete was very popular among Bahrainis but His Highness took exception to the heavy gambling that took place at some of the stalls and it was olosod after running for little more than a week. It is reported that the fete made Rs. 45#000/- before it closed. (xix) There have been a number of resignations over the last few months from amongst the engineering staff of Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. the reasons seem to be a lack of many amenities and the fact that much of the construction material for the company's building operations has not yet arrived and there is little work for their engineers, this leading to boredom. Many of those who have resigned have elected to go to East ..frica in order to work on the development projects there. (x) Pearling , the 11th November. Rs. 85,000/-.

It is stated that Saiyid Shahab, uncle of His Highness, who usually officiates for him during his absence from Muscat has decided to leave for India, possibly to discuss affairs with the ex-sultan who is now in Bombay. (iii) Merchants present themselves almost daily at the Agency for assistance to import Japanese goods, which appear to be invading the markets of the gulf, particularly piece-goods. Their cheap textiles afford the local merchant a greater profit than those of the United Kingdom* Similar goods, particularly cotton piece-goods appear to be smuggled through G-wadur to Baluchistan and Pakistan where prices are high. Quantities of Biscuits, toffee, perfumes and even high class watches are finding their way to the local bazaar from Bahrain, presumably smuggled* (iv) On receipt of the news of the birth of a son to Their Hoyal Highnesses Pricosss Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh, His Highness wrote to ILn's Consul asking that his congratulations be conveyed to Their Majesties and Their Royal Highnesses.

He ms accompanied by - Xo Fatehchand, a Bombay pearl merchant* 2* LOCLiL AFFAIRS. (i) ..1 round robin signed by a large number of the Al Khalifah shaikhs and addressed to His Highness ohaikh Salman asking him for increases in allowances has led to a real family row. The-Shaikh as usual when his pocket threatens to be affected became incensed, and condemned his relations^ with indeed a good deal of truth, as vicious and useless parasites ^ not that that really upsets him but he genuinely objects to‘unconcealed vise. He ms, however, so allarmed at the threat ening attitude of some of his cousins and brothers, that he increased the allowances to the Al Khalifah family by Rs. 280,000/- per annum, his two uncles, as usual receiving a major share* It is not yet known hpw much of the additional allowances wall cone out of public revenues, but the disbursement has already had repurcus 3 ions among Bahrain Government employees who have begun 'talking about a general increase in salaries* This incident is symptomatic of the unfortunate social and /economic.economic consequences of the monetary inflation following the pouring of oil royalties into an area, the inhabitants of which do not know how to spend them. (ii) On the 11th, His Highness shaikh Salman formally opened the new pumping station in lianamah erected by Messrs Holloway Bros., to supply the town with piped drinking water* (iii) The wells in most private houses in Manamah are very badly kept by their owners and are in a filthy and insanatory condition. The Bahrain Government have been contemplating the sealing up of many of these wells now that Manamah has a piped water supply, and a recent tragedy may force them to take immediate steps to this end* On the 12th, a servant who descended one of those wells to recover an eating mat that had fallen into it was ocorcome by the gases he had disturbed in his descent and drowned. A second servant who descended to search for the first suffered the same fate. ^ third man who attempted to enter the well was also affected but was pulled up in time to save his life. The State Medical Officer was summoned and, after the two bodies had boon recovered, he chlorinated the well and ordered that no person should go near it until it had been sealed up. (iv) The Bahia.in Government have asked the Bahrain Petroleum Company to conduct a chemical analysis of the water being supplied in the now piped water system for Manamah town. (v) His Highness and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government have often expressed their concern at the great wastage of water that takes place from the uneconomical sinicing of wells and have in several instances made this the reason for holding up or refusing the sinking of now wells by the • Bahrain Petroleum Company, alleging that this would result in the drying up of other wells in the vicinity. The Company have now pointed out that they were recently consulted by Kis Highness about the sinking of a new well in the property of one of the -.1 Khalifah and that though they advised against it on the grounds that the property could be easily supplied with water from other wells in the area and that a new well would supply a quantity of water far in excess of that required for the property. His Highness insisted on thg sinking of a new welln The Political A^ent wrote to His Highness expressing the concern that His Majesty’s Government take in the pro per conservation of water in his territory and asking that when expert opinion is given him. by the Bahrain Petroleun Company he should not disregard it. Ills Highness replied that he is equally concerned in the proper conservation of water in his territory and that ho has always followed the advice of Bapco. This is an old chestnut - and so it* goes on., (vi) The advisor to the Bahrain Government has written to the Manager of Messrs Cable and iireless and informed him that so long as the company insist on maintaining those clauses in the subscribers’ agreement to which there has been objection neither Kis Highness nor the other Arab subscribers are prepared to sign the agreenento The main point at issue seems to be that of a high tariff with an unlimited number of calls to be allowed each subscriber versus a low tariff with a limited number of calls* The company maintain that a high tariff would mean fewer subscribers but His Highness and the other Arab subscribers do not agree with this viov/ and want calls to be unlimited* (vii) uomo months aje f the British Council allocated a small sum of money for subventions for local educational organisations, .ifter consulting the local educational authorities, the British Council were /asked.asked to provide sets of physiology and biology wall charts, travel association posters and photographs* and charts of British agri-* culture, industry and ccnimerce. These have recently been received here and have been distributed to the schools concerned. (viii) The Bahrain Petroleum Company have opened a school in which English and arithmetic are taught to about 50 of the local employees. The school is well run although its object it not generally social uplift 1 *, but to make the employees more useful to the Company. (ix) The Bahrain Government have been concerned at the public discontent with the large profits now being made by local shop keepers; shops are now well stocked with a large variety of goods, but it is thought that the profits t a ken are excessive. The Agency Courts recently fined a shopkeeper As, 1,000/- for profiteering and it is hoped that it will have a deferent effect on other profiteers. (x) There have been numerous reports reaching Bahrain of the kidnapping and enslaving of persons on the Trucial Coast and, to a lesser extent, in Qatar. The population of the Trucial Coast have been hard hit by the post-war depression which has involved their main industry, pearling, and there have been many cases of fathers selling their children and a few of persons selling themselves into slavery*' The immediate market for slaves sems to be located in Buraimi, from where they are taken to Qatar and baudi Arabia where slaves fetch higher prices. The largest demand cones from baudi Arabia where a girl will fetch Rs. 4&gt;000*/- or more. Political (xi) Two meetings have been held recently at the/Aesidency Jufair, to discuss the allocation of short wave grequencies in the Persian Gulf area. They v/ere attended by representatives of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, Petroleum Concessions Limited, Cable and .Vireless, Aeradio Ltd®, and an Aramco representative later had a discussion with one of the Residency staff. It was decided to make and keep a list of frequencies at Bahrain, bharjah, Muscat and Kuwait® 3. TRUC1AL CO-ibT. (i) Qatar . baleh A1 Mani*, secretary to His Excellency the rtuler of Qatar, to whom the Political ,'^gent spoke when he visited Qatar recently) has now found Haim bin tfadiya and sent him to Bahrain. The boy was kidnapped in Dubai and taken to Dura ini where he was bought by one Huhammed bin Salim, a Qatari, who sent him with nis agent to Qatar for sale to the *miir of Dukhan* */hen a search was made 1 or the boy he was sent away by the -.juir to the interior of .}atar from where he was eventually recovered by the efforts of baleh A1 Aani* • The fact that the Political Agent took the boy* s father with him to Qatar and presented him to baleh al Iiani* is probaoly responsible for his son* s rescue. (ii) Petroleum Development (Tr uc ial Coast) Limite d. On the 1st December the Company bejin a survey of the area south of Jabal „ai. The extent and direction of this survey will depend on the results achieved by the Company in the course of ohoar survey operations*/(vii) ■5- (iii) Dubai, On the I4th Shaikh Saqr bin I/Iuharamad, Ruler of Has al Khaimah, arrived at Sharjah. Ke left for Dubai on the 16th and called on ohaikh Rashid bin oaid and Jurnah bin Kaktum (shaikh Said being aivay hunting) and renewed his friendly relations with them. He called on Mr. !*.!.. Jackson, Representative of Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd., in Dubai and then returned to Sharjah when he left for Ras al Khaimah on the l?th. (iv) Dubai - Rbu Dhabi dispute. Evidence has been accumulating that Shaikh Rashid, son of the Ruler of Dubai, has been bribing the Buraimi tribes in order to win them away from their allegiance to iibu Dhabi. Ke is reported to be paying as much as Rs. 300/“ to a Chief who normally gets only Rs. 20/- or Rs. 30/- from the Ruler of ,Vbu Dhabi whose limited ^ resources do not allow him to make large payments to the tribes. The latter has informed the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, that Shaikh Rashid has also sent spies and mischief makers to Buraimi in order to create dissension between the Buraimi tribes anfi. Abn. Dhabi. He appeared, however, confident that Rashid would not succeed in I . his attempts and said that he was satisfied as to the loyalty of the Manasir, his chief adherents. The Political Officer, Trucial Coast is warning ohaikh Rashid to desist from his undesirable activities. (v) Fujairah . Shaikh Kuhammad bin Hamad ash-3harqi of Fujairah and Shaikh Huhammad bin Rli, paramount Chief of the Beni pi tab, recently met at the Jiri and professed friendship to each other in the presence of ohaikh Jumah bin Maktum. (vi) Sh arjah . a) The ohaikh of Sharjah has increased security precautions by night, Ke was seen once patrollin- the town at night. Ke and his brother I.Iuhammad sleep in the Fort instead of in their usual houses. The ohaildi of oharjah has not disclosed to anybody the reasons that led him to take such measures, but from discreet enquiries it is possible that he may be uneasy about his step-brothers who have always been discontented with the somewhat parsimonious allowances he has been givin 0 them, b) There is said to be ill feeling between the ohaikh of Sharjah on the ope side and the Chief of the Beni Oitab, Huhammad bin Ali bin Kuwaidin and his nephew Ali Bin .Abdullah bin Huwaidin on the other over payments due to them on account of oil. Direct negotiations produced no result as the Chief of the Beni .itab and his nephew were obdutato in their attitude towards the ohaikh of oharjah. Both parties v/ere called to the Agency but no settlement was arrived at between them as the Beni Qitab Chief demnded more payment to which he ms not entitled. Muhammed bin .*11 then retired to his desert encampment and the Beni Qitab have not yet started ary depredations against Sharjah# c) It is reported that the ohaikh of oharjah feels that Shaikh Rahmah bin AbdulRRahman of Hire is intriguing against &amp;in and accuses him of instigating bedouins against him. Shaikh Rahman is therefore unable to come to oharjah as he fears that he may be arrested by the Shaikh.- 6 - (vii) Nai'm, The Nai’m tribe under Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan looted some camels from the Beni Qitab and the former retaliated by stealing five camels from the Nai’m. iis a result, on the 18th, the Shaikh of Ajman v/ent to see Shaikh Muhammad bin mli bin Huwaidin of the Beni Qitab at his desert encampment. Ho intends to take him to liahdhah and from there send word through Obaid bin Jumah, Chief of the Beni Ka'ab, to Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan, , saying that he wishes to bring Muhammad bin Ali to him at Buraimi in order to discuss and settle the camel dispute* (viii) Awami r* * During the period under report, Salim bin Musa Ham bin Haim, Chief of the Hal Haiw sub-section of the Awamir, arrived in Dubai in connection with the return to the Beni Qitab of camels stolon by the liwanir. (ix) Rain * Towards the end of November, heavy rain fell on Abu Dhabi territory up to and including Buraimi, The rain lasted five days and formed a lake in a salty depression some 20 miles south-v/est of Abu Dhabio This lake is over 6 feet deep in parts and has already attracted numerous birds including duck and flamingo* (x) Sho oting Incid ent. On returning from Buraimi as mentioned above, the Political Agent and party were fired on and held up by Beni Qitab tribesmen. The Naim n Dolil !! (guide) with them nearly made matters worse by shouting that he was from the Nai'm and that they and the Beni Qitab were 'on the same road''. This remark was taken derisorily and it was not until Mr. Bird of the Petroleum Concessions Limited, had explained that the cars were oil company cars that the party was allowed to proceed. The excuse given by the Beni Qitab for the hold up was that they expected Nai’m to be in the cars and wrere hostile to them as a result of the theft of camels. The Residency ^igent unfortunately gave the Beni }itab Rs. 10/- on the party being permit ted to proceed and this may encourage similar instances. IND&amp;C PRICE8.

(v) Dr* D.Do Boovariwallah, the new Indian burgeon employed by the Kuwait Health Department arrived from Bombay on the 5th. 8&gt; LOCAL HEWS . (i) His Highness has appointed Shaikh Abdullah Mubarak in charge of the new Passport Department which is being opened shortly. There was a good deal of opposition from the Salim faction who ..^-nted this important post for themselves and endeavoured to got it for the Police* His Highness decided against them finally. (ii) Dr. D.G. Kody, the Indian Eye Specialist employed by the Kuwait Health Department who had proceeded to India on leave in the middle of November last, returned with his family on December 11th. On his return, ho refused to attend the hospital in the afternoon on the grounds that afternoon duty was not included in the verbal agreement ho had made with Abdullah Salim. The regulation to attend the hospital in the afternoon was x^ssed by the Health Committee during his absence. He was requested to attend the dispensary for two hours which he refused to do. The dispute was finally settled by the Political -i-igent and Br» liody and his family loft for Bombay by steamer at the expense of the Kuwait Government. Dr. Body’s treatment by the Kuwait Government was generous in the extreme, but he had only a verbal agreement. In exchange for his monthly wage of Rs. 2000/- he was only expected to give four hours work' in the forenoon. He was permitted to carry on private practice for the rest of the day. In addition to his salary he received free transport, housing for himself and his family, lights and a servant.

Two men certainly had had a drank or two and were insistant on what they called their rightso They were led away by Mr. Evans of Spinneys who quietened them with another drink and sent them home./14*. -9- ( iv ) Walter Goddon was convicted on I''riday the 31st by the Political Agent under section 406 for mis-appropriating Kuwait Oil Company property valued at Ha. 8000/~ e ^ • VISITS OF RO YAL NAVY AND U.S. I^VY, (i) Royal Favy&gt; K.lvuS.

Firstly the rate of freight offered is cheaper than that of the B.I. oecondly, l&amp;y goods being shipped direct to Colombo chances of pilferage in transit are eliminated, and lastly goods are shix^ped quicker than by the Jhould this become a regular feature, it is feared the DMI will not only suffer loss in passenger traffic, but also in transhipment of ^oods.
