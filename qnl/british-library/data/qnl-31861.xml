With reference to paragraph 2 I venture to explain that the suggestions contained in paragraph 4 of my despatch No. 315 of June 30th were prompted by a desire to find an alternative to the line of action (a general reference to the Persian Courts) suggested by the Government of India, as well as by a desire to devise some means of fulfilling what may be regarded as a humanitarian, if not a legal, obligation to see that the children are brought up as well as circumstances permit. The two original grounds of investigation to which you refer were not in my mind. I agree that these have been settled, though I fear that many more reasons for investigation are likely to keep arising in their place until such time as the children are of age. 3. With reference to paragraph 3, I fear that I must have failed to make myself clear. Paragraphs 4 and 7 of my despatch No. 315 were intended to show that the surrender of the income only was contemplated and that any demands for the surrender of the capital should be firmly resisted. 4. For myself, I am quite content, so far as the legal position and possible complications with the Persian authorities are concerned, to leave things as they are at present, as I think Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I.* etc., etc., etc., FOREIGN OFFICE.think that it should be possible with moderate firmness to withstand any Persian pretensions to interfere with the guardianship of the property. But I presume that in this case the suggestion that directions should be sought from ( the Persian courts may be regarded as in abeyance. 5. So far as the children’s welfare is concerned, I enclose a copy of a despatch from the Acting Consul at Shiraz, showing that the girl, Effat-ul-Mulook, is now married. I also enclose a copy of my reply and trust that this meets with your approval. The girl’s marriage, in my opinion, absolves us of any lingering moral responsibility for her upbringing. As for the boy, we must continue to take such indirect steps as are possible to ensure that his health and education are properly supervised. 6. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 193) and to the Acting British Consul at Shiraz (No. 31). I have &amp;c., (Signed) V.A.L. Mallet.British Consulate, Shiraz September 7th, 1933. Sir, With reference to your despatch No. 315 of 30th « une 1933 addressed to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, I have the honour to submit a brief account of the recent marriage of Effat-ul-Mulook, the daughter of the late Haji Mustashir-ul-Mulk, and to seek your guidance on the various points it raises. 2. I have already given some account in a demi-official letter addressed to Mr. Summerscale dated 2nd September, of the first report of the marriage and of the efforts made by this Consulate to dissuade the girl from such a step. Since writing that letter, I have been informed by the girl herself that the marriage took place on August 30th, and although I can place little reliance on anything she says, reports from other quarters leave little doubt that she is actually married. It is difficult to see clearly through the network of intrigue which lies behind the marriage, but my information is that a sum of Tomans 2,000 was promised, if not actually paid, by the husband, Hussain Aga Parvizi, to Mirza Ata Khan, the maternal uncle of Effat- ul-Mulook, for his share in arranging it. A portion of this sum was apparently promised by the latter to his younger brother, Mirza Mohammad Ali Khan Matin, but I understand that as this has not yet been forthcoming, the latter is threatening to raise the question of the legality of the marriage with the Adlieh on the grounds (l) that Effat/ His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, British Legation, G U L H E K.Kffat has taken out a Persian in which she uses, without permission, his family name of Matin (11) that she has not yet reached the age of physical fitness. Reports vary as to the financial standing of the husband. He is, however, a brother of Shaikh Mehdi Khan a well-known Shiraz lawyer, who was an opponent of the Consulate some years ago, in a claim made on the childrens behalf to some land at Doulatabad. 3. Up to the present, there has been no attempt to claim the girl’s share of the *estate on the grounds that she is now married, and she has been warned that she will not be entitled to do so until she reaches the age of 21. But, owing to the unscrupulous and intriguing behaviour of her relations in the past, I cannot ignore the possibility of such a claim being put forward in the near future. That I should be legally correct in withholding the money is clear from a ruling given by the Additional District Judge, Bushire in a letter No. 19/817 of 12th April 1927 addressed to Mr. Chick and I propose, subject to your approval, in the event of such a claim arising, to oppose it by simply stating that it is contrary to the terms of the guardianship. 4. The question of the girl’s nationality is not so clear to me. In recent years she has been supplied with a Temporary Certificate of British Nationality the last one issued expiring on to-day’s date, but I understand that in order to facilitate her marriage she has obtained a Persian ’’Sijil”. Would I be correct in assuming that the fact of her marriage to a Persian subject taken in conjunction with Circular despatch No. 14 of 26th July 1933 make her claim to British nationality extremely remote, if indeed at all tenable?5, As regards the future maintenance of the girl, she has now gone to live in her husband’s home, whither according to her own statement, her furniture has been removed. I have therefore, given notice to the landlord of the house formerly rented on her behalf that the four months lease which expired to-day, will not be renewed. The girl continues to send almost daily requests to the Consulate for money, and although I am refusing to make any payments for the present, I should be glad to know, particularly with reference to her monthly allowance, whether you consider it advisable to adopt the attitude which seems to be justified by Article IX of the Persian Marriage Law of 1931, that, now that she is married, her husband must provide for all her wants. I have, etc., (Sd) F. H. GAMBLE.t r * t m t; it«? i m*^*«*4*« . 1 1 * t * ( October 17th, 1933. Sir, I have received your despatch No. 24 of September 7th reporting the marriage of Ef fat-ul-Mulook, one of the two children ol the late Haji Mustashir-ul-Mulk whose property is under the guardianship of His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz. 2. Inasmuch as His Majesty's Consul is not the guardian of the children s persons, I do not consider that you need regard the marriage as being in itself a bar to the payment to the girl of any portion of the income of the estate, even though the marriage may have unsatisfactory features and even be of doubtful validity in Persian law. The amount of the income paid to the girl should still be based on her needs, limited possibly by the needs of her brother. In any estimation of her needs the ability of her husband to support her is, of course, a material factor. I shall deal separately with the details of the allocation of the funds as between the girl and her brother. 3. In this connexion, I doubt whether Article 9 of the Marriage Law of 1931, which reads as follows: 'IX. Les aliments de la femme sont a la charge du roari. Remarque . Par aliments on entend le logement, 1'habillement, la nourriture, les mobiliers dans une mesure en rapport avec la situation des epoux.' is applicable. This article I take to refer to the rights of the wife against the husband, and it can hardly be held to limit the right of the wife to any property of her own to which she might otherwise be entitled. 4. The nationality of Effat-ul-Mulook is quite clear. She is by birth a British subject but she is also a Persian subject by The Acting British Consul, SHIRAZ.by the Persian Nationality Law, though this law gives her the option of renouncing her Persian nationality in favour of British nationality at the age of eighteen. In the eyes of this Legation she therefore possesses (or possessed) dual nationality; the Persian Government on the other hand do not recognize dual nationality, and would not recognize her as a Britisn subject even outside Persia. The effect of her marriage, assuming it to be valid according to the lex loci , is to deprive her of the Britisn nationality which she acquired at birth, as well, presumably, as the right to renounce her Persian nationality at eighteen, and she becomes a Persian subject pure and simple. This fact does not, however, deprive her of her rights under the guardianship. 5. I approve the reply which you propose to make to any demand for the surrender of the girl’s share of the property. I do not myself anticipate that it will prove at all difficult to resist any sucn demands. I am, etc. (Slgned)V.A.L. MALLET.. I-. - - British Legation, TiHHAfc. April 6th 1936. Sir, X hare the honour to aoknovlodgo the receipt of your despatch No. 88 of March find IMS (I WS/829/S34) oonceming the guardianship of the two children of the late Haji Muutashir-ul-Mulk and to express sy thanks for ths guidanse and instructions contained therein* 2* There is only one point upon which I venture to offer coianents for your further consideration* You state in pars* graph 4 that 'contrary to what was stated In paragr^h 9 of your despatch Mo* 84 to ths Acting Consul at Shiraz' no objection could be raised if the Peraian courts were to assuae jurisdiction regarding the persons of the children, inasmuch as in natters of personal status British subjects of the Moslem religion are, under the terns of the 'Safeguards', subject to Persian law* This is not, however, precisely the point with which I was trying to deal in paragraph 9* What I had in nlnd was the effects of Article 1 (4) of the Persian nationality law of 1989* Under these sections s child born in Persia of a foreign father la a Persian subject If either parent waa alao horn in Persia) he can» however, opt for hla father’s national ity on reaching the age of eighteen. X etill auggeat that, whatever the jurisdiction of the Persian courts nay be, it a would be very undesirable that ve should admit as a general principle that aueh children, whether Moslems or not, must in all respeeta, more particularly that of education, be treated as The Bight Honourable Sir John Simon Q*C*S*1*, etc*, etc*, etc*, THS P0&amp;2IGM OmCS.‘ sv. -8 at Persian sublets until they are slghtssn* 3* A concrete ease Is that of ay chauffeur, an £ngllah*an nosed Parses, who some years ago serried an Armenian woman (a Persian subject)* They hare a eon, who is now about ten years old* Assuming that Mr. Parfces were In any other employ merit than that of thla Legation, the Persian Government sight at any time claim that the boy was a Persian subject, and must therefore wear a Pahlerl hat and be educated only in such schools as they deemed proper* They might make the same olalm about the children of Hajl Muetaehir-ul-Mulk, if the mother were to appeal to them# but I dfc not think the clai^ should bm ever be admitted, even if we were unable to secure catisfaetlon in the immediate esse In point owing to the faet that it was the wish of the mother which the Persian courts might be expected to uphold, that they gnould be educated as Persians* It was to this question of nationality that I was referring when I expressed the opinion that the death of the father and j the circumstances of the guardianship ought not to off set the cue*tion. 4. The question «f the Jurisdiction of the Persian courts in regard to the property is of sons practical inportanoc, for though most of the property is invested in England, a few proprietary intereete remain in Persia. These are for the aast part somewhat shadowy and doubtful claims to part shares in Shiras house property. It is moreover possible that at sons future date clains nay ba nada against tha guardian by parsons who consider, or pretend, that land sold on behalf of the infants in the past belonged by right to thenselwes* A staple dispute as to the proper ownership of property would not, ofxo •5. of course, sffect the guardianship as such* 5# 1 «“ sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Oorernaent of India (*o. 67) and to the Acting British Consul at Shiras (Ke. 9). i hare the honour to he with the highest respect, Sir, Your aost obedient, huatole Serrant, (Signed) R.H.

If, therefore, it were desired to resist a claim of the Persian authorities that a child situated in the circumstances of the two children of the late Haji Mustashir-ul-Mulk should conform to Persian Law, whether in matters of education or in some other connexion, it would not be possible to find any legal basis for such resistance and it would be necessary to argue on some other grounds, and it is not clear wnat such grounds could be.

The Consul has been lawfully appointed by a valid order, but does that make principles of English lav;' applicable merely because he is himself a British f. tional. It is worth considering that in passing hie order in 1925, under the (Indian) Guardian and Varda Act ' a ~ 3 *tended, the Additional District Judge, by reason that the infants were Moslems, was clothed with the character and exercising the functions of a Qaei administering Moslem law. The order was passed under British Indian law, which recognises that with respect to Moslems their personal law is to bo applied in such case*. Again, with reference to tho effect of tho safeguards, this order is not one purporting finally to dispose of contested ri^ts between two parties. It is an order which necessarily involves consequential acts and, a] oat inevitably, further consequential orders. You cannot koap tho Court out of it. Suppose ENCLOSURE IN ^ 13 JUL 933 from/from a change of circumatancaa or conventenco it bocame dosirablo to appoint aome one olao guardian of the property, it uould be difficult to eballiogo the validity of an order of the Persian Court, so long as it purported to rest on the change of circumstances, and not on the invalidity of the original order. Then again, if a demand were made for special payments on account of the infants, e*g.fer marriage expenses, the guardian might well desire to protect himself by an order of Court, Under the order appointing bin ' •&gt; has to file his guarditmship accounts annually and they have to be passed by the Court. And when his guardianship ceases he will have to go to the Court for his discharge. In all these cases I think the former would now haro to bo tho Persian Court. As ro^ards p«ra.6 of th# P.G.despatch wo are hardly in a position to judgo how far if at all tbs English Courts could handle the matter. The property appears to be largely real estate situate in Tars, and neither the infants nor the guardians are within their jurisdiction, ffe do net know what ie the property in England or in what form or in wfase name. I may add that the matters referred to in the Government of India letter of 1st June 1933, as to the impropriety of the general permission given in th# order, do not in any way affect the validity of the appointment itaelf or ef the other parts of the order.

Guardianship of the two children of the late Haj i Mustasnir-ul-i*iulk. Sir With reference to the despatch from the Foreign Office to His ilsgesty^ Minister, Tehran, Ho. 82, dated 2nd ^arch 1933, on the above subject, I am directed to convey the following observations by the Government of Inaia on the despatch referred toi- They are in general agreement with the statements in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 thereof. As regards paragraph 5, they agree that His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, is now responsible to the Persian Court which has succeeded to the jurisdiction of the Additional District Judge, Bushire, by whom the original appointment of the guardian of the property was maae unaer the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, as declared to be in force by the Persian Coast and Islands Order-in-Council, 1907. Thus it is clear that the orders made under the Guardians and Wards Act, if they continue in operation, must be suoject to the jurisdiction of the Persian Court. 2Q AsAs regards paragraph 6, the Government of India feel dillident about expressing an opinion, but would suggest that, since no appointment of a guardian has been made in England, it is difficult to see how the British Courts could nave an/ jurisdiction and unlikel/ that the/ would not recognise a guardian lawfull/ appointed in Persia, . The original order of the Additional District Judd, L nushire, appointing His .uiajest/’s Consul, Shiraz, as guardian of the property was improper in so far as it purported to give i him in advance a general permission to mortgage, charge, lease or transfer by sale, gift, exchange or otherwise any part of the property. Por each such transaction, before it occurs, a separate order of permission is required under Section 29 of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890* Further directions may be required under Section 33. The Government of India consider that the Consul should consider hims&amp;lf to be bound by these provisions of the Act and when he requires permission or a direction he should apply to the Persian Court which has taken the place of the Court of the Additional District Judge, Bushire. Lastly, they would suggest, that in view of the anomalous position in which His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, must inevitably find himself as guardian of the property, he should consider the desiraoility of applying to tne Persian Court to have himself removed from the guardianship. If this is not considered desirable, the Government of India are of the opinion that His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, should be advised to take a general direction from the Persian Court, as to the manner in which he should conduct himself in the exercise of his office as guardian of the property, and for what purposes he should apply for special directions, having regard to the fact tnat the Indian Act unaer which37 A ue Was appointed is no longer operative. &amp; co py of this letter is being sent to His Majesty^s Minister, Tehran.

The children moreover owe their British nationality to forbears oaoe domiciled ta British India and it appears natural that questions affecting their personal status should primarily be dsolded la aoeordanee with Indian lav. i aot certain, however, how far the Indian Courts would consider the®selves competent to deal with the guardianship of these children when neither the children nor their guardian wors within their jurlsdletloa, and even if they were to take decisions or to Issue i net motions, the question of their enforcement la Persia, cur la inland, would present separate problems. 6.

The outcome of any dispute on the subject cannot be foreseen, but the fast that la this case the father la dead, the reputed guardian a non-Moslem British official and the mother a Persian subject (by origin and by re-marriage) ought not to be allowed to obscure the issue* 10, heaving aside the question of the children's nationality, it is doubtful whether the Persian courts could ba relied upon to uphold the slain of a non-Moslea British official to exerelao in respect of Moslon children•Bjr of th* rights ®f gusrdlssahlp In such ssttsrs as custody sad education. natural yrcjudlec would probably bo too strong to permit of a contrary decision, although the arguasata suggested la paragraph 8 of your haspstab Ho. *1 hare both, to ay Bind, considerable lagal weight, ss has also tha fast that the aether was divorced fro* the father prior to hlo death and has therefore no rights In reepoct of tha children, even uador Moslew la*. oa tha other hand, tha Persian courts haws no power to touch may part of the property lodged la England and the possibility of their atteaptlag to do ao by restricting tha liberty of tha guardian aan, X think, be dismissed.

Sir, P.Z. 1372 FOREIGN OFFICE] 93r3. j 2nd March 1933. -iosj With reference to your despatch No. 557 of December 29th 1932 concerning the guardianship of the two children of the late Haji Mustashir-ul-Mulk, in which you request observations as to the legal aspect of the case, I have to• inform you that, subject to the considerations set forth in the succeeding paragraphs, the position would appear to be stated fairly correctly in your despatch No. 24 of December 29th to the Acting Consul at Shiraz. 2. As His Majesty’s Consul was appointed guardian of the children’s property by the former British Court in Persia, there can be no doubt that he is the legal guardian of that property unless and until some competent court makes a further order. This is abundantly clear as far as English law goes, since the Order in Council of 1928, by v/hich His Majesty’s Government’s extra-territorial rights in Persia were determined, expressly Reserved the validity of all acts of the former British courts. As regards the validity of the guardianship in so far as Persian law is concerned, this would seem to rest , upon the provisions of Safeguard No. 14 in the Persian note of May 12th 1927 from the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran contained in Enclosure No. 6 of Sir R. Clive’s despatch No. 238 of May 18th 1928 to Sir Austen Chamberlain. It is there expressly stated that all judgments rendered by the old courts, even if they had not been put into execution, were to be considered as finally settled and were not to be susceptible of re-examination. R.H. Hoare, Esq., C.M.G., etc., etc., etc. , Tehran. 16 ‘''iAR. enclosure h FROM SECRETARY, F' .i. l * V- SECRET DEPT. INDIA Dl FlCE( 3- It may therefore he assumed that the Persian urts would noi. he in a position to dispute the validity of the appointment of His Majesty’s Consul as guardian of the children's property; on the other hand it must he cleanly recognised that his guardianship does not extend to the persons of the children. He cannot dictate where they shall live or t ohall he brought up except that he would presumably be Justified in withholding funds for purposes of which he strongly disapproved. His functions, therefore, consist in administering the property to the best advantage and in supplying the children with such sums as are reasonably necessary for their maintenance and education. 4. From the fact that the Consul is only guardian in respect of the property, it would appear to follow contrary to what was stated in paragraph 9 of your despatch No. 24 to tne Acting Consul at Shiraz, that no objection could be made if the Persian Courts were to assume jurisdiction regarding the persons of the children. In this connexion the position as stated in paragraph 10 seems to be correct, particularly as Safeguard No. 12 of the Persian note above referred to provides that in matters of personal status British subjects of the Moslem religioh shall be subject to Persian law. 5. The only remaining question, therefore, is how far the Persian Courts could purport to assume jurisdiction not merely in regard to the persons of the children, but in regard to their property. The Persian Courts would appear to be bound for the reasons indicated to recognise the Consul as the lawful guardian of the children’s property, and it would appear that by Safeguard No. 12 a British subject of non-moslem religion in his capacity as guardian is subject to his national law/law, so that the Persian Courts would be bound to apply the principles of English law to all questions arising concerning His Majesty s Consul’s guardianship of the property. This t &amp;lso seen i3 to follow by inference from Safeguard 14. On the other hand it does not seem possible to maintain that the Persian Courts have no jurisdiction in the matter of the guardianship the property of the children so long as they observe the above conditions. Clearly some Court must have jurisdiction, and prima facie it would appear that the jurisdiction of the former British Court in Persia has devolved upon the Persian Courts by the abolition of extra territoriality, subject to the obligation of these Courts not to reopen any judgments or orders of the former British Court and to deal with cases arising under those orders on the basis of the orders themselves and to apply the same law. It seems very doubtful whether your suggestion in paragraph 5 of your , despatch to Mr. Acting Consul Summerscale that the non-completed \ duties of the former British Court may possibly be regarded as having devolved on the High Court of Bombay, can be correct since it appears that the jurisdiction of the High Court at Bombay only came in by way of appeal from the decision of the former British Court, and no question of any such appeal can I now arise. 6. However, it may be possible that, in view of the fact that the property is located in England, an English i-' Court would have jurisdiction in the matter, and that there may in consequence (as is not infrequently the case in such matters) be a concurrent jurisdiction regarding the property, both in the Persian and in the English Courts.7 . rrom the difficulties attendant upon the position, and from the fact that it may well be very difficult to dispute the jurisdiction of the Persian Courts did they l^are to intervene, it seems clear that the Acting Consul should avoid, so far as is consistent with his duty, any action which would be likely to draw the attention of the Persian authorities to this matter, or which might result in the question being taken up in the Persian Courts. The mother does not seem well-disposed, and will probably be quite capable of going to the Persian Courts if dissatisfied, ihe Acting Consul should therefore be careful to pay over regularly the sums which are reasonably necessary for the children’s m aint enance, and, unless he considers that such a step is absolutely necessary, he should probably avoid purchasing the house.
