The Historical Monuments, Institutes of Learning, of Art and Science, the artistic and scientific Missions, the personnel, the material and collections of the Institutions and Missions above mentioned will be considered as neutral, and as well as such will be protected and respected by the belligerents. Protection and respect will be due to the Institutions and Missions named above, in the whole stretch of the territories submitted to the souverainete of the High Contracting Parties, without any discrimination when regarding the national allegiance of an Institution of a particular Mission. ARTICLE XI Each one of the High Contracting Parties could furnish to the Record Office of the Permanent Court of International Justice/Education of the Union or of the Pan-Americans Union at Washington, at its choice, a list of the monuments, institutions, and public or private collections that it desir to place under the special protection foreseen by the present Justice at La Haye, to the Institute of International Interlectual co-operation in Paris or at the Departme: Education of the Union or of the Pan-Americans Union , ^ris or at the Department of* it desires Pact.

The Monuments, Institutions, Missions, and Collections above named will cease to enjoy the privileges of neutrality in the case when they will come to be utilised in military purposes. In the case where it would have been alleged that an act contrary to the protection and respect due to the Institutions, Monuments, Missions and Artistic and Scientific Collections and stipulated in the present Pact would have been committed, Institutions or Missions complaining, could appeal through the intermediary at her Government to the International Institution wnere which sne would have been registered. The International Institution concerned will then put tne complaint to the knowledge of all the High Contracting Parties who could then decide to constitute an International Commission of Interest charged to proceed with investigations on the signal facts. The statements of the International Commission of Inquest could be made public. The details relative to the constitution and to the functioning of the said Commissions of Inquest will be regulated by a special accord. ARTICLE III. ARTICLE IV./ARTICLE IV.

According to our records Dr. Itoerieh, the originator of the pact, a man of Russian birth, of doubtful nationality and with a French passport, has conducted a mmhm* of scientific expeditions into Central Asia, all of which have been attended with occurrences calculated to arouse curiosity if not suspicion and, owing to the view© entertained of him by the Government of India, His iajesty’s Government have refused to have anything to do with hi© activities. This apart, the pact itself ha© been carefully considered on its merits and, a© a result of consultation with the various interested departments some time ago, it J»H. ^enson, sq. , F.C.15 it was found thmt there were other objections to the ace ess ion of Mis Majesty’s tkjvernment. In the first place, it would undesirable to encourage the Pan-faerie an tfni on to inaugurate general agreements of this nature, thus usurping the proper functions of the League of Mat ions. Secondly, the adoption af s red and white distinguishing mmrk not readily distinguishable from the Bed Cross emblem may posslhxy he regarded ss an undesirable method of ensuring the protection of the monuments and institutions concerned, more especially in view of the absence of adequate prowl elone for preventing the improper use of the emblem. On these grounds it was decided that it would not be desirable for Bis iajesty f s -overnment to accede to the pact. Membership of the Committee of the Union appears to carry «tth it the obligation to '‘interest 'others in the .^aet and to induce them to help in any 'way the work of the Society'.

Please refer to your demi-official letter Ho.D* 1325-JC/36 dated the 20th March 1936. there is extremely little sample material. On the evidence available I think that the Government of India should be cautious in assuming financial or any form of responsibility for Mr. George Roerich's dictionary. But more sample material might perhaps be called for before coming to a decision. I enclose a note on the subject.

If, in a clear field, Government were contemplating the compilation of a Tibetan-&amp;ngli8h( or English-Tibetan) dictionary, the first step to be taken would be to consult well-known authoritiem as to the general lines Unxe ar« la laila aiaao? Patar of LolaKa^ar. Jlaaio ‘ who has recently revised tne translation of the greater part Bible into Tibetan, Dr. Knox of Khlimpong, and, for of colloquial Tibetan, Colonel Bailey and members of the staff, past and present, of the Sikkim Agency. In England there ar* eudh'high authorities as Sir Charlee Bell, and, as an Orienta list, Sir Blward Denison Rose, who are doubtless in toucii with learnedv s v learned eooietlee in England and on the continent and with sfudnent authorities such as Professor Baoot of Parle and Tuochi of RoaeCidio has good knowledge of colloquial dialects). 6. At the present stage in titetan lexicography, and in order that a new dictionary spy meet the needs of OoTernmant, particular attention rtiould be paid to the following pointsi- A. Colloquial 1 .vbetan. ©f this there are several variants both as regards the use of different words to mean the same thing and also as regards different local pronunciations of the same word. The lahasa dialect should be taken as standard and deviations (Bastern, shigatse and Western} from the standarjkd should be noted. Ho dictionary yet published has ■batn adaquat* on the colloquial aide* With the introduction of Modern aim a, electricity, and extension of trade and of political relations, many new words hare come into use and should be included in a modern dictionary. The language baing strongly idiomatic, sufficient space should be devoted to idiom* 3* ifedern epistolary and literary Tibetan. Many old book- words have fallen out of us© and if now used would appear to a Tibetan to be incorrect. It is important that words now current should be distinguished from words which are no longer employed* q 0 in the case of rare or obsolete words taken from old books it is desirable (1) to quote evidence of their occurrence, (ii) to distinguish between (a) words of Tibetan origin (b) words which although of foreign origin have become par&lt;- and parcel of the literary language (o) words which are undigested adaptations from the Sanskrit (iii) to indicate their modern equivalents. D. Before financing another dictionary Government should decide on what lines phonetic spelling may best be undertaken.

Hoarich'a (and Jasdhka'«)T^ j in vtalda. is particularly misleading. S. It would be convenient if, in phonetic renderings, stress accent were indicated. y# In Tibetan there are three tones- high, medium, and low- each of which may be short, medium, or long. Use of the correct tone distinguishes the meaning of syllables which otherwise would be indistinguishable, while the use of a wrong tone makes words unintelligible or absurd, a new dictionary should Indicate tone. This can easily be done. 0* In any new Tibetan dictionary the English must be first rate- otherwise it will be misleading to Tibetans-^ particular ly to the Tibetan Government who ordinarily send their tele- 7» In the preceding paragraphs I have dealt mainly with the practical needs of those who have occasion to speak write or read the current Tibetan of today, in so far as Mr.Roerich* a dictionary may be intended for use by scholars interested in ancient Tibetan literature it is important, if Government is to associate itself with the work, that the work should be scholarly. In lexicography it is inevitable that compilers should make large use of material assembled by their predecessors* But such material should be used critically and in an expen sit© new work a considerable amount of fresh research &amp;nci a high degree of accuracy may be expected. 8. The enall amount of material supplied by Mr* Roerich suggeste the following comments#- A.

Thie however is not the occasion for an extensive exposition of minutiae of criticism. The following remarks deal with matters of more general importance. (i) Extravagance of space. (a) the six lines of poetry unaer PKROq-PA are hackneyed and unnecessary. (b) The 32 line excursus on classes in metaphysics would be more appropriate to a treatise on Tibetan education than to a dictionary. (c) In the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, several words appear to be ^dictionary words** ( i• s« words such as CIRC3H-0LUDS, or AB-CMD3* which, on the analogy of IH-CLODS and Bl-CLUBS, might be expected to exist, but actually do not). (d) Several entries are entirely pointless e.g. *to become . monB* -where ths alternative words for • to b.come M^°f'• (k&gt; ^ich are among the 10 Comonneat Ter ha in the language, ahiie the Hatrd is in ©rrect) are exactly the game word* which would r:s u s@d if it were a question of 'becoming a clerk, a hutdier or a tailor), (e) Ho attaapt is aadie to adopt ohTioua abbreTiationa, fhua In the dtfcgwritapi di sour sue in Column 2 ^nz XH^ qHYA occurs some 17 times, both in Tibetan and in transliteration, (f) , There is much waste of space both between lines (which could be remedied by a trifling modification of type) and in the fora of broken lines, (g). Inasmuch as transliteration is unnecessary and irritating tea student who can read the Tibetan character, and unintelli gible to one who can not, it might with ad wantage be omitted - BTSD -MX&amp;AJ distracts attention from the fact that the word is pronounced CHS-XHJS. Similarly with 2KRGH -BSKTSD for TRGHG-KXE (ii) The phonetic rendering, r (a) Is* in my opinion* bn a wrong basis, BeU 9 s TROK -FA being simpler* better, and cheaper than y ^ o K ^ (b) Is tec seldom given (c) Does not distinguish between different dialects. (ill) In a majority of instances there is nothing to show whether a word is obsolete, literary or colloquial, (It) There are no indications of stress or tone, (t) In some ways the method of adapting a subject rather than a purely alphabetical arrangement of words is attractive (as if •forgive 1 were to be entered under •givem* ). But on tne specimen page the process, which entails repetUioa elere in the dictionary, has been carried too far, 9 . what ever may be Mr. George Roerich’s qualifications as a phllologi»t and as an authority on Buddhlw, his opportunitia of studying Tibetan as » living language particularly m ths Ifcasa area, hav. been 1 United.

The time has passed when two individuals, howsver painstaking, can hope, unaided, and with little firet-h&amp;nd knowledge of Tibet, to make any first class contribution to Tibetan lexicography. The main needs of the present time are a compe tent dictionary of modern colloquial and epistolary Tibetan, with a good system of phonetic renderings} and a good Sngliah- Tibetan dictionary# Possibly the necessary team mi$at be got 11 together} but/is improbable that Mr. George Hoerich and his collaborator would be prominent members of the team# 12# It is however unsatisfactory to attempt to appraise any man f s work on inadequate evidence. If Government contemp late accepting responsibility in regard to Mr. George Roerich's dictionary, the best course would be to call for several copies of not less than 20 pages of consecutive material, and to submit the material for examination by competent scholars both in the literary and philosophical, and also in the epistolary and colloquial fields. 3d/— 3. «T . 0. 30/3/36*„ , ^ 'V i t . «(g\ foreign and ibliticai Department, B.e.uo.a.iass-v'se.

The Pan-American Union has drawn the attention His Majesty's Government to the rioerich Pact for the protection of artistic and cultural institutions and historic monuments. The Pact owes its origin to the Roerich Museum at Rew York and after its adoption by the Pan-American appears to have been signed byl^et^''' ^ States on the American Continent. It is now open to signature by all States. His Majesty's Grovernment have on previous occasions declined to be connected with the movement resulting in this Convention (P.

It is submitted that we may concur in the Foreign Office proposal that His Majesty's Government should not accede to the xioerich Pact. It will be noted, however, that the Foreign Office advance the proposition that the connection with the scheme of Dr. Hoerich would not seem in itself to constitute a reason for rejecting the Pact.
